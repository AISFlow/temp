42402821,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd8Dq,1555693538,Privacy Crypto Monero Celebrates Its 5th Birthday,"One of the most popular cryptocurrencies for privacy protection, monero, celebrated five years of existence this week.  Launched in April 2014, monero has, since its inception, been entirely crowdfunded. And in tune with this decentralized, grassroots structure, monero is almost entirely developed by volunteers.  “Monero is very committed to its decentralized, grassroots structure meaning we took no premine. We don’t take a percentage of the block rewards. There was no [initial coin offering,]” monero contributor Diego Salazar told CoinDesk. Salazar estimated that “depending on people’s time and availability” there is anywhere from 100 to 200 volunteers working on the monero project.  Additionally, the project itself, according Salazar, isn’t just about building a blockchain protocol. It’s about re-defining and bolstering a global movement centered around digital privacy.  Salazar told CoinDesk:  “We’re not just trying to make global internet money. We’re trying to teach people the importance of things like privacy...It’s a very powerful tool and I think it’s a very necessary tool in our day and age.”  To this, Italian developer and Monero contributor “SerHack” released a free PDF version of the book “Mastering Monero” in commemoration of the coin’s fifth anniversary. Originally published in late 2018, the book was fully funded by the monero community and teaches non-crypto users the importance of “private and censorship-resistant transactions.” The project's online community further commemorated the anniversary with events and, in one instance, a celebratory puzzle.  While monero is not the only blockchain to boast private on-chain transactions, it is the largest among its kind by market capitalization boasting a $1 billion valuation, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  In that five-year span of time, the project has undertaken a series of significant upgrades in a bid to further improve the project, including those aimed at bolstering fungibility and transaction privacy.  Minimum ringsize  “It’s critically important for the fungibility of monero that we don’t know what source of funds you are receiving,” contributor Justin Ehrenhofer told CoinDesk. “That way you don’t know if you’re accepting funds that were used for any other previous purpose.”  From the start, monero aimed to obfuscate fund sources through what are called “ring signatures."" Through ring signatures, transactions are signed by one member of a group of participants (each of whom has private keys), but with the goal of making it difficult to know who among the group actually contributed a particular digital signature.  As Ehrenhofer explained:  “With monero, for every input that you are spending, you will pull other inputs from the blockchain, other people’s random inputs...and it makes it appear as if all these inputs are spent. It makes it seem mathematically like any one of these [inputs] could have possibly been the [transaction] signers.”  However, at launch, pulling from other random user’s transaction inputs called ring signatures was not mandatory. Cryptocurrency exchanges, public mining pools, and other individuals who didn’t care about preserving transaction privacy could opt to have a “ringsize” of zero.  Monero researchers realized that with a large enough number of users not obfuscating their transaction sources, the privacy of other users risked being compromised.  “If I sent a transaction that revealed what real output was spent by me then that means if anyone else made it seem like they spent my output everyone would know that’s a fake spend because in my transaction I obviously spent it,” Ehrenhofer told CoinDesk.  That's why on March 22, 2016 monero executed a hard fork to restrict all users to obfuscating their transaction sources through a minimum ringsize of three. This meant that users would need to pull from at least three other random transaction inputs in the network when making their own transaction and thereby collectively take part in strengthening the privacy levels of the entire blockchain.  “One of the big challenges monero needed to overcome in the beginning was making their existing infrastructure better,” Ehrenhofer said. “This meant basically forcing people to use best practice and force these ring signatures to actually have use.”  RingCT  The second most influential change in monero’s history also had to do with ring signatures.  Called Ring “Confidential Transactions” (CT), this upgrade executed through a hard fork on January 5, 2017. It effectively added an additional layer of privacy to ring signatures by obfuscating monero transaction amounts.  The activation of RingCT meant that outside of not being able to identify transactions to a source or an address, Monero now made it virtually impossible to find out the transaction amounts being transferred.  “The outputs were already disconnected from addresses,” Ehrenhofer explained. “[RingCT] took this a step further in saying when these outputs are transacted, we don’t know what value they are in either.”  In fact, when looking up a monero address on a blockchain explorer, the warning message users get back on one of the explorer sites reads:  “Uh-oh, for a moment there it seemed that you were trying to peek into this monero address...It really looks like you were, like, trying to check out this dude’s balance. Well, monero says ‘No’!”  The idea for Ring CT originally came from a bitcoin proposal called “Confidential Transactions” proposed by Blockstream CTO Gregory Maxwell. It was then re-purposed by monero developers to work with ring signatures.  However, Ring CT in improving the privacy of the monero blockchain actually made a substantial trade-off to scalability.  “Transactions before Ring CT were about three kilobytes. They were also about 10 times larger than a bitcoin transaction. Ring CT brought these numbers up to about 13 kilobytes so we multiplied by another four or five x,” Ehrenhofer told CoinDesk.  Bulletproofs  To that point, “bulletproofs” -- while not improving privacy directly -- is still regarded as a major improvement to the network.  Bulletproofs, according to Ehrenhofer, reduced transaction size and verification time on monero by about 80 percent. From 13 kilobytes to 1.5, monero transaction size has dramatically decreased in size – though at present it still remains larger and more difficult to verify than bitcoin transactions.  The technology, released late 2017, was celebrated as a privacy breakthrough and initially created for use on bitcoin by University College of London’s Jonathan Bootle and Stanford’s Benedikt Bunz. Ultimately, monero became the first major cryptocurrency to go live with the technology through a hard fork on October 18, 2018.  Even so, Ehrenhofer notes that verification times on the network are still “really monero’s biggest limitation at the moment.""  Ehrenhofer told CoinDesk:  “The hardest thing we have to scale in monero is not transaction size. It’s the verification time. We can make monero ring [signatures] enormous today...but the verification time would be almost impossible. Even thought it wouldn’t take up that much room on your computer, it would take you forever to figure out what’s what.”  As such, looking ahead Ehrenhofer hopes that forthcoming improvements to the protocol will find a way to increase ring signature sizes to host anonymity sets of over 1,000 at some point.  From Salazar’s perspective, another forthcoming improvement to monero he sees upcoming in the next few months is an upgrade to the network’s user interface and experience (UI/UX).  “A lot of things are being redesigned from scratch like individual pages, the transaction history page, the send and receive page,"" he told CoinDesk.

42402822,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd8Ep,1555684227,Malware Crypto Ransoms Rose By Almost 90% in Q1: Report,"The average cryptocurrency payout for ransomware attacks rose dramatically in the first quarter of 2019, according to a firm that helps victims pay ransoms.  In its quarterly report, Coveware said that, while in Q4 last year the average ransom was $6,733, it shot up by 89 percent to $12,762 in the first three months of 2019.  The rapid hike in crypto demanded comes thanks to the increasing prevalence of more expensive strains of ransomware – which encrypt victims' files and demand a payment in cryptocurrency to unlock them – such as Ryuk, Bitpaymer, and Iencrypt, according to the firm.  ""These types of ransomware are predominantly used in bespoke targeted attacks on larger enterprise targets,"" Coveware said.  The Ryuk ransomware strain in particular has shot up in prevalence. In Q1, in first and second place, respectively, Dharma and Crysis held their leading positions on the market share table (below), while Ryuk is now in third place. That's a notable climb, since it was not a top-three placer in the previous quarter.  Ryuk is also targeting larger organizations than other variants, the report says. Not only that but it is demanding far higher ransoms. For example, Dharma requires an average ransom of $9,742, while Ryuk demands $286,556 on average.  Bitcoin is still, and is likely to continue to be, the most popular cryptocurrency demanded by bad actors deploying ransomware, Coveware adds, although privacy coins like dash make up around 2 percent of demands.

42402828,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd8Kj,1555677042,Ocean Tries New Token Sale After CoinList Offering Misses Target,"After a token sale on CoinList failed to reach its target, data marketplace Ocean is trying again on crypto exchange Bittrex International.  Ocean Protocol has a vision to become the ecosystem for ""a new data economy,"" its founder Bruce Pon told CoinDesk. With the release of Ocean's version 1.0 beta network earlier in April, its tokens are ready to be used on the platform, but the company has not quite met its fundraising goal.  Through its initial exchange offering (IEO), Ocean aims to raise $6.77 million in bitcoin, following a previous round of over $24 million from Outlier Ventures, Block Asset, Fabric Ventures and Digital Currency Group, according to its listing on CoinList.  With its prior 2019 token sales via the Coinlist and Fractal platforms, the firm ultimately raised a total of just $1.8 million, according to a March blog post. If it succeeds with its IEO, it will meet its original goal announced in February for the CoinList sale.  ""We had seen that an IEO was a good way to have more awareness and a broader distribution,"" Pon said, while also granting they still needed to close that budget gap.  Its listing partner, Bittrex, has been caught up in a recent dispute with the New York Department of Financial Services over its decision not to grant the company a bitlicense. However, its presence in New York is not relevant to Ocean's present efforts.  Reflecting on its disappointing token sale, Pon said the U.S. is not ""the best environment"" for this kind of fundraising right now, admitting:  ""We misjudged. We went toward a highly regulated jurisdiction. We followed the rules. But the potential purchasers – or acquirers – they are also uncertain themselves.""  Its deal with Bittrex allows Ocean to focus on its core work for this next sale, while Bittrex will market the listing to its large base of users. ""They are the ones who are leading the effort to reach out to their customer base,"" Pon explained.  In particular, he's optimistic about the company's user base abroad. ""We think there's a lot more crypto enthusiasts coming out of Asia,"" he said.  Better deal  In light of market mood, Ocean has also halved the price of the token from that in the earlier sale, from $0.25 to $0.12.  Ocean noted to supporters in its Telegram channel that they should read the full IEO announcement before flipping out. That's because participants in the original sale will still be able to opt-in to the better deal, Pon explained, and will get a distribution of tokens at the new price.  ""It was just fair,"" he said.  The initial circulating supply of OCEAN tokens will represent 22.3 percent of the total supply of 1.41 billion tokens. The greatest portion of future tokens, 51 percent, will be emitted through network rewards for validating transactions, though Ocean has not announced its consensus model yet.  The vision for Ocean is to serve as a place where those with large pools of data can share them securely, allowing data scientists to run analyses on them. The data holders will get the analysis they need and the scientists will both get to hone their tools and earn money as they do so.  The token will be the medium of exchange for these transactions, but Pon explained it will be also used to stake data sets as a way of signaling quality data.  Pon further articulated a much larger vision for the OCEAN token. ""What we ideally see for the token is it becomes the reserve currency of the data economy,"" he said.  For example, he described a future where companies generating large amounts of data (such as autonomous car sensor makers) could fund the development of their product by selling a security token against the future revenue of that data set – a kind of data IPO.  ""What happens if the people who have bought shares in those data streams start to act on behalf of those data streams to get more channels of distribution?"" Pon asked.  That's the sort of future Pon believes could be feasible, provided Ocean is able to mobilize the resources it needs to develop the software today.

42402838,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd8Rc,1555671621,Bitcoin Clings on Above Key Support Amid Signs of Price Pullback,"View  Bitcoin suffered a rising wedge breakdown, or bearish reversal, on the hourly chart earlier today. The bearish view, however, has been neutralized by the quick bounce from the key support near $5,170.  Acceptance below $5,170 would confirm a head-and-shoulders breakdown on the hourly chart and open the doors to $5,000.  A close below $4,912 on Sunday would validate the previous week’s doji candle and allow a deeper price pullback.  Bitcoin could challenge the recent high above $5,450 if sellers again fail to keep prices below $5,200.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) three-day run of slight gains is showing signs of exhaustion on the short-term technical charts, yet strong support below $5,190 has meant a pullback has remained elusive – so far.  The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading largely unchanged on the day at $5,250 on Bitstamp, having gained 3.4, 0.6 and 0.9 percent on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, respectively.  The gains invalidated Monday’s bearish outside reversal candle, which had called for a deeper drop below $4,900. Further, price closed above the stiff resistance of the 100-candle moving average (three-day chart) yesterday, signaling a continuation of the rally from April 2 lows below $4,200.  That several long-term indicators have recently turned bullish seems to have strengthened bullish expectations.  This is evident from the fact that bitcoin has established new support just below $5,200 over the last 72 hours, despite persistent price-negative developments like bearish patterns and indicator divergences on the shorter-duration charts.  Hourly chart  On the hourly chart, BTC dived out of a rising wedge pattern at 01:00 UTC today, confirming a bearish reversal.  The follow-through to that bearish setup, however, has been bullish. As seen above, prices have bounced up from $5,180 and are currently looking to re-enter the rising wedge.  Notably, the $5,180–$5,170 range has put a floor under bitcoin’s price for the second time in the last 72 hours.  The cryptocurrency had been feeling the pull of gravity on April 17, courtesy of the bearish divergence of the relative strength index. The pullback, however, ran out of steam around $5,170 with prices rising to $5,325 yesterday.  As a result, if the bears can pull off a break below $5,170, it may invite strong selling pressure and open the doors for a deeper price pullback, possibly to $5,000.  The case for a price pullback looks stronger if we take into account the fact that acceptance below $5,170 would also confirm a head-and-shoulders breakdown – a bullish-to-bearish trend change.  Sellers, however, would need to act quickly, as another strong bounce from levels below $5,200 could entice buyers and lead to a sustained move toward the recent highs above 5,450.  Weekly chart  BTC created a doji candle last week, signaling bullish exhaustion, as discussed earlier this week. As a result, Sunday’s (UTC) close is pivotal.  The buyer exhaustion signaled by the doji would gain credence if the price settles below the candle low of $4,912 on Sunday, possibly leading to a deeper correction next week.  A bullish close above $5,466 (doji high) would strengthen the long-term falling channel breakout seen earlier this month and open the doors to $6,000.  That looks unlikely in the short-term, though, as prices are struggling to find acceptance above a number of key moving averages (MAs) lined up in $5,200–$5,500 range.

42402832,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd8Mh,1555668005,Volkswagen to Track Minerals Supply Chains Using IBM Blockchain,"Volkswagen Group has announced it will use blockchain tech to track its mineral supply chains.  The German automaker said Thursday that, in order to ""responsibly source"" minerals such as cobalt (used in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles), it has joined an open industry collaboration, which also includes Ford as a member.  Currently, miners and consumer brands rely on third-party audits and ""laborious"" manual processes to comply with widely accepted industry standards for sourcing their minerals, VW said.  Using blockchain technology to track supply chains will help the firm meet responsible sourcing standards set out by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) by providing a permanent record of mineral movements to aid the compliance process.  For the effort, VW will use a new permissioned platform, developed by the group on IBM Blockchain – which is built using Hyperledger Fabric – to enable the tracking of minerals across the global supply chain.  The collaboration, formed earlier this year, also includes as members cobalt mining company Huayou, LG Chem (a unit of South Korean conglomerate LG Corp.) and raw materials supply chain auditing firm RCS Global.  VW said in its announcement:  “Participants in the network, validated by RCS Global Group for compliance with responsible sourcing standards, can contribute and access immutable data in a secure and permissioned way to trace and record the flow of minerals across the supply chain in near real-time.”  The automaker further said that the group aims to expand membership to include other industries, including aerospace, consumer electronics and mining operations.

The U.S. regulator announced Thursday that California resident and cryptocurrency trader Eric Powers failed to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act’s (BSA) registration and reporting requirements during 2012–2014.  While conducting the business of buying and selling bitcoins on the internet, Powers did not register himself as a money transmitter or as a money services business, FinCEN said.  He also failed to report suspicious transactions in cryptocurrency and fiat currency. For instance, the regulator said, Powers conducted around 160 transactions of bitcoins worth about $5 million and also conducted over 200 transactions involving the physical transfer of more than $10,000 in currency, but did not file a single currency transaction report.  Powers also processed several suspicious transactions without ever filing a suspicious activity report, including doing business related to the darknet marketplace Silk Road.  Powers has admitted to the violations, according to the agency.  FinCEN director, Kenneth A. Blanco, said that “Obligations under the BSA apply to money transmitters regardless of their size.”  Blanco further said that there were indications that Powers “specifically was aware of these obligations, but willfully failed to honor them,"" adding:  “Such failures put our financial system and national security at risk and jeopardize the safety and well-being of our people, as well as undercut responsible innovation in the financial services space.”  As a result, Powers has been fined $35,000 and is barred from providing money transmission services.  Back in 2014, FinCEN ruled that bitcoin payment processors and exchanges are money services businesses under U.S. law. Last year, the regulator said that money transmitter rules apply even to those who conduct initial coin offerings or ICOs.

42402816,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd89u,1555646535,Aragon Vote Aims to Restrict Ethereum App from Funding Polkadot Blockchain,"Two weeks from now, token-holders for the Aragon application will put the efficacy of its on-chain governance model to the test.  The Aragon project, launched in 2016, is envisioned as a way to offer users the tools to build decentralized organizations that are secured cryptographically and run natively on top of the ethereum blockchain. But starting as early as February of this year, the core developers behind Aragon have expressed interest in launching a version of the app on the Polkadot blockchain network.  At the time it was announced, Luis Cuende, CEO of AragonOne – a for-profit entity building Aragon – said that the idea was “very early research” and did not indicate any specific intention to move away from launching their product on ethereum.  Now, token holders of Aragon are deciding between two competing Aragon Governance Proposals (AGPs) that will effectively approve or restrict such plans to build the application outside of ethereum. The vote is set to begin on April 25 and last for 48 hours, and the the final results of the voting cycle will be announced April 27 at 16:00 UTC.  AGP 42  was submitted by Ameen Soleimani, the CEO of adult entertainment blockchain platform Spankchain. To wit, the proposal is dubbed ""Keep Aragon Focused on Ethereum, not Polkadot.”  Soleimani's pitch proposes “to restrict Aragon from spending money on Polkadot development in any way, shape or form” and posits that many Aragon token holders “are significant stakeholders in the ethereum ecosystem” who wish to see Aragon remain strictly focused on ethereum.  Conversely, AGP 41, submitted by the Web3Foundation the exact same day as Soleimani’s proposal, would approve the non-profit entity holding all of Aragon’s development funds – known as the Aragon Association – to hedge up to $1.5 million in native Polkadot tokens calls DOTs.  The proposal reads:  “The Aragon Association is seeking the signalling by the community for the approval of closer engagement in technology collaboration and parachain development, as well as in purchasing DOTs to diversify its crypto assets.”  At present, the Aragon Association holds roughly $37 million in both crypto and fiat currencies. Their largest holding, worth roughly $33 million, is all held in ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ether.  Executive director of the Aragon Association Stefano Bernardi explained in a post that the organization cannot publicly disclose the price at which the Web3Foundation is offering the sale of DOT tokens. However, should AGP41 be rejected, ""the deal that the Aragon Association has the option of entering into is also available to the Association employees and board members"" to partake in individually with personal funds.  A simple majority vote by Aragon token holders is all that is required to successfully implement either AGP and decide the future roadmap of the project.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Cuende explained:  “I would like to see AGP 42 not to have a lot of support because I really want to see Aragon in many, many chains ... I just want Aragon to succeed however it takes and the technology we use is secondary for me. That’s my position on it.”  In the hands of the token holders  Cuende goes so far in characterizing AGP 42 as a “threat” to the success of Aragon.  “If it passes, the first thing I would do is just start drafting my own proposal for the next ballot [in June] basically doing a declaration of independence,” said Cuende to CoinDesk. “I think the fate of our project will be decided by the platform we build upon so having multiple really helps have choice and reclaim your independence as an app or second layer protocol.”  At the same time, Cuende highlights that no matter what he thinks, the ultimate decision will lie in the hands of the Aragon token holders who decide how funds are distributed from the Aragon Association.  Token holders have “a lot of skin in the game,” Cuende explains, which on Aragon directly translates to governance power. The more ANT tokens a user holds, the greater sway he or she has to influence an AGP vote.  Such a plutocratic form of governance, Soleimani tells CoinDesk, runs into problems “if the token holders of Aragon can vote to have Aragon do things not in the Aragon community and team’s best interest but in the token holders of Aragon’s best interest.”  “[Aragon] has chosen to be governed by their tokens and in so far as their tokens are held by people who have a lot of ether...it might not make their token holders happy if they then go and build on another platform,” said Soleimani.  As such, Soleimani contends that this upcoming voting round for Aragon will be “an important experiment” that illuminates some of the inherent difficulties of a plutocratic form of on-chain governance.
