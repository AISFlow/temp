42402267,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3llF,1543269606,"Employees Say Startup Civil Hyped Crypto Returns, But Failed to Pay","Civil was supposed to create a more transparent and democratic model for journalism. But so far, journalists working on its platform have yet to receive all of the compensation they say they were promised when hired.  According to several current and former employees of news organizations sponsored by the blockchain startup, Civil told journalists in 14 newsrooms around the U.S. that the CVL cryptocurrency – which, when issued, was supposed to comprise part of their pay – would probably end up being worth several times more than the estimated valuations mentioned in meetings and reported in tax forms.  Yet lackluster demand caused Civil to cancel a public sale of the tokens last month. Now, the reporters have no idea if or when they'll be paid the tokens that were supposed to be part of their compensation.  Meanwhile, the platform, conceived as a collaborative network where readers would pay for quality journalism and journalists would earn money for content, remains unfinished. The newsrooms, which employ dozens of journalists, are operating normally, but without the tokens originally meant to provide a compelling value-add for users.  ""Civil can talk all it wants about creating a new future for media, but the reality is it's being built by putting journalists into debt,"" said Jay Cassano, who left the Civil news outlet Sludge on Nov. 8 because, he said, undelivered tokens made up roughly 70 percent of his salary for five months.  ""I had to borrow money to pay my rent and student loans,"" Cassano told CoinDesk.  Civil CEO Matt Iles disputes the current and former employees' claims.  ""We didn't promise anyone tokens would be worth any specific amount,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Anytime we discussed potential token value with newsrooms, we made it clear we were making estimates and that there was risk involved.""  Iles counters that Civil took steps to discourage the kind of frenzied buying that could have driven up the price of CVL, had the tokens been issued publicly. He told CoinDesk:  ""Civil's consumer token framework restricts liquidity and volatility as a means to ward off speculators and ensure that people buying CVL do so because they want to participate in the network.""  Indeed, Civil used a rigorous know-your-customer process and partnership with the exchange startup AirSwap, which created a means to restrict access to CVL purchases.  But according to Cassano and other insiders, employees were told a different story about the expected price of CVL.  Internal hype  Specifically, according to Cassano, Civil told reporters working with its sponsored news operations that the CVL token they would be partially paid in could be worth around $0.75.  However, on tax documents, the tokens were valued at a fraction of a penny. Iles would not comment on that difference.  ""They kept hyping it up internally to keep us in line, saying they were even going to exceed that valuation,"" Cassano said. ""Iles, at one point, said he expected the tokens to double or quadruple in value compared to what was written in our contracts.""  A second Civil reporter, who still works at one of the newsrooms sponsored by the startup, told CoinDesk the startup's leadership ""absolutely"" talked up the token's growth potential to employees.  ""The expectation was they were going to be able to get rich off of it,"" the source said.  According to this insider, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, days before the token sale flopped, Civil addressed reporters' concerns about it by saying that crypto ""whales"" would buy up unclaimed tokens to help the startup reach its threshold goal.  Iles denied making any promises but acknowledged that the company tried to get large buyers involved when the sale languished.  ""As the sale wound down, it was obvious to everyone that the only way to meet the goal would be to attract large-scale token buyers... of course we were still working hard to bring in major buyers during the final days,"" Iles said. ""We communicated our ongoing efforts on this front, but there was never any promise or guarantee made.""  The failed token sale forced Civil to refund ""purchasers"" $8 million, including $1.1 million worth of CVL purchased in September by the partner company ConsenSys, which is spearheaded by Civil's primary investor, Joe Lubin.  While Iles confirmed that Lubin was promptly reimbursed, reporters at Civil newsrooms say they don't know if they will ever receive the token portion of their compensation packages.  Iles confirmed a Quartz report that he will eventually own 5 million CVL, whenever they are distributed.  When tokens?  As for when that is expected to happen, Cassano and an insider say they haven't been given a timetable, despite Iles' statement to the contrary.  ""We've communicated target dates to the newsrooms and plan to confirm details in the next few weeks,"" Iles said. ""We will not share those dates publicly before speaking to them.""  Furthermore, Iles said Civil has an active GitHub project for an open-source application and publishing platform, often garnering dozens of contributions a week.  The controversy about employee compensation at Civil raises different legal questions than those that usually come up in the discussion of tokens, which usually center around whether initial coin offerings (ICOs) are unregistered securities.  Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm Byrne & Storm, P.C., told CoinDesk that different laws might apply to private offerings via employee contracts rather than strictly public offerings.  ""There are things that you can be given or possess that increase in value but aren't a security,"" Byrne said. ""You've got to pay your people and you've got to be honest with them, otherwise different questions arise.""  Byrne also added that the legal questions surrounding tokens will be driven by specific facts and circumstances. In the case of CVL, the public buyers were reimbursed, meaning Civil may not have anything to worry about from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or from ""purchasers.""  ""There is a provision in the securities laws that allows anyone that has participated in a sale of unregistered securities [to] extinguish its liability to those persons by affording them the right to rescind,"" Byrne said.  He concluded:  ""With regards to employees, it depends on how they acquired the thing and whether they are deemed to be part of the offering.""

42402281,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3lz1,1543259260,XRP Nears Longest Stretch as World's Second-Largest Cryptocurrency,"XRP has now officially held its ranking as the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization for the longest period since 2016.  On Nov. 15, the market capitalization of XRP, a cryptocurrency long connected to San Francisco blockchain startup Ripple, reached $19.39 billion, enough to establish it as the world’s second largest cryptocurrency after overtaking ether (ETH), long the market's reigning number two asset.  This 11-day stretch is the longest XRP has spent at number two since it held the title for 13 days from Jan. 26 to Feb. 8 in 2016.  In fact, the dominance rate for XRP, an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by the cryptocurrency, reached a 45-week high of on 12.74 on Nov. 20 (it has since retreated slightly to just above 11 percent). For comparison, bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance rate is currently 53.9 percent while the rate of ether, now the world's third-largest cryptocurrency registers 9 percent.  Notably, since XRP began its market share uptick on Nov. 15, the broader cryptocurrency market has witnessed a significant sell-off, losing nearly $90 billion and 40 percent of its total market capitalization to date.  Needless to say, the market rout has resulted in significant depreciation to many if not all cryptocurrencies against the U.S. dollar. XRP and ETH are reporting 22 percent and 37 percent respective losses in the 11-day span while the world's largest cryptocurrency is down 32 percent.  Despite XRP's advance in the market capitalization ranks, ETH, has recorded significantly more trading volume as of late. In the last 24 hours alone, ETH's exchange volume of $2.47 billion is nearly twice as large as XRP's $1.3 billion, according to CoinDesk's Crypto-Economic Explorer (CEX).

The company further aims to streamline its investor relations, build up liquidity and compliance efforts, and maintain capital formation.

Monex Group, the Japan-based online brokerage firm that acquired Coincheck following the hack, announced Monday that the exchange has resumed depositing and purchasing services for the XRP and factom (FCT) tokens.  The news means Coincheck has now resumed services for all nine cryptocurrencies available for trading at the time of January’s hack. These include, aside from the two mentioned above: bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), ethereum classic (ETC), litecoin (LTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), NEM (XEM), lisk (LSK). Support for ETH, XEM and LSK was added only two weeks ago.  At the end of October, the exchange also started accepting new account signups for customers living in Japan, which had been suspended while regulator-mandated improvements at the exchange were underway.  Going forward, the exchange is looking to resume several other features, including leveraged transactions, Japanese yen depositing through convenience stores and a scheme that lets users pay power bills with crypto, according to its Monday announcement.  Back in January, hackers stole some $533 million-worth of cryptocurrencies from Coincheck, which led to on-site inspections by regulators and a block on accepting new customers. Monex Group later acquired the platform in April in a $33.5 million deal.  Last month, Coincheck reported a loss of $5.25 million (588 million Japanese yen) for the Q3 period (Q2 in the Japanese financial year) as a result of the hack.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, the exchange has facilitated about $31 million in trading volume on its platform over the past 24 hours.

42402277,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3lv5,1543240854,"SpankChain Has Paid Camgirls $70,000 Worth of Crypto in 6 Months","Since raising $6 million in a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO), porn startup SpankChain has differentiated itself from the token-sale pack by actually delivering a platform with thousands of users.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, SpankChain boasted 6,136 active users as of October, and has paid roughly $72,422 in cryptocurrency to 31 webcam models since the site launched in April. Several freelance SpankChain performers say they are now earning more on SpankChain than any mainstream porn site.  “I crunched the numbers,” performer River Sunshine, who has been camming for five years, told CoinDesk. “I was making on three sites combined, 6 percent of what I made in the same 30-day period on SpankChain.”  Fellow performer Molly Mae Meow, who has been camming for more than six years, said she too makes much more money on SpankChain, which only charges performers 5 percent of their earnings compared to the standard 50 percent across the industry.  “I think a lot of members appreciate that I’m getting almost the whole amount of it,” Mae Meow said, adding:  “I was a little skeptical about all of it at first. But now I really, really love crypto.”  Sunshine and Mae Meow are examples of sex industry veterans who were introduced to cryptocurrency through SpankChain. They generally cash out the platform's ethereum-based SPANK tokens as needed for weekly expenses, storing the rest as some form of digital asset for long-term savings.  “I feel more in control of my money than I did using the banks and payment processors on other sites,” Sunshine said.  Word of SpankChain’s lucrative platform is spreading across performers’ social networks. According to SpankChain’s internal data, every week around 20 new performers sign up to join.  Tokenized equity?  Speaking to how “staking” SpankChain tokens on the platform, or locking them up and earning rewards for letting those tokens fuel the network, offers models a way to essentially control something comparable to equity.  Mae Meow said: “Giving models that much power in your site can be very beneficial. You’re not just working on the site, everyone on the site is also working for you.”  Of course, this raises a thorny question: Is SPANK an unregistered security under U.S. law, exposing SpankChain to regulatory risk?  It’s too soon to say what legal classification staked tokens will eventually have given how U.S. regulators are cracking down on token issuers that, like this sex industry startup, considered their assets “utility tokens” rather than investments.  “The question is how people perceive them and use them,” Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm Byrne & Storm, P.C., told CoinDesk.  He went on to add that, generally speaking, any token system that doesn’t include mechanisms to prevent speculative trading could present some risk from a securities law perspective.  “Token issuers are setting them up for an almost impossible task,” Byrne said. Referring to the test created in a Supreme Court case for determining what is an investment contract, he added, “the Howey Test is deliberately extremely broad.”  However, SpankChain CEO Ameen Soleimani told token holders, via the company’s public discord channel, that he’s not concerned about regulators hindering the ecosystem’s growth because the team “never discussed price appreciation of the token” and “deliberately tried to keep SPANK off the major exchanges.”  Soleimani went on to say his company has not been contacted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and would happily cooperate with such regulators.  One aspect that complicates questions about SPANK is that SpankChain's webcam platform itself isn't the startup's long-term revenue strategy. Instead, the webcam site is essentially a proof-of-concept for SpankChain’s crypto payment processing, using SPANK’s stake system, which Soleimani hopes porn companies across the industry will switch to as an alternative to traditional payment processors.  As such, despite SpankChain's popularity among performers, the overall sentiment in the broader ethereum ecosystem recently prompted layoffs at the startup.  Without commenting on how many people were laid off on November 20, Soleimani told CoinDesk in a statement:  ""While we’re immensely proud of the impact of Spank.live, our main revenue model is based on the adoption of our SpankPay wallet across the adult industry—and that’s going to take some time...in the face of the bear market, SpankChain had to slim down and refocus our company efforts on shipping.""  Creative freedom  On the other hand, tokenized holdings aren't the only opportunity attracting SpankChain's performers to the network.  In addition to gaining more control over their income, SpankChain models noted that the crypto-powered platform offers more creative freedom than other camming sites.  For example, mainstream platforms that work with credit card processors often ban fetish performances, such as Disney princess roleplay or knife-play with real fake blood (though real knives). For Mae Meow, joining SpankChain opened up a whole new world of possibilities.  “I love doing some taboo shows and I can’t do that on other sites without the fear of getting shut down,” Mae Meow said. “I love dressing up and doing Halloween stuff.”  At the same time, increased financial censorship since SESTA-FOSTA bills passed through Congress earlier this year is forcing many performers offline to more dangerous, public environments.  Sunshine agreed, saying that after those laws passed having control over her own cash out process was crucial. SpankChain’s system, like many blockchain platforms, allows for immediate access to funds because there’s no waiting to deal with credit card chargebacks.  “I have more a sense of freedom to do [unconventional content],” Sunshine said, adding she now prefers crypto over any fiat alternative. “I wish I could pay my rent and bills directly from my crypto wallet.”  Another distinction both Mae Meow and Sunshine noticed is that SpankChain users, predominantly veteran crypto fans, are less demanding and open to more diverse content, such as cooking shows, than general audiences. Instead of trolls demanding performers immediately get raunchy, as they often do on other sites, SpankChain viewers have generally been happy to let performers set the tone.  “You have control over the show,” Sunshine said. “It’s honestly changed my life. I feel excited to get on cam now.”  Molly Mae Meow image via SpankChain",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/26/spankchain-has-paid-camgirls-70000-worth-of-crypto-in-6-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c877210139052409b2fa59456287efd40b42a7b-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402266,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ljH,1543235431,Bitmain Faces $5 Million Lawsuit Over Alleged Unauthorized Crypto Mining,"Cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain is facing a class action lawsuit for over $5 million that alleges unauthorized crypto mining by the firm.  On Nov. 19, lead plaintiff Los Angeles County resident Gor Gevorkyan filed the case against both Bitmain's China- and U.S.-based entities in the federal court of the Northern District of California, alleging that the firm's devices use customers’ resources to mine cryptos for its own benefit prior to full setup.  “Until the complicated and time-consuming initialization procedures are completed, Bitmain’s ASIC [Application-Specific Integrated Circuit] devices are preconfigured to use its customers’ electricity to generate crypto currency for the benefit of Bitmain rather than its customers,” reads the filed complaint seen by CoinDesk.  The document indicates there are more than 100 class members involved in the action and that the aggregate amount under debate “exceeds $5,000,000, exclusive of interest, fees, and costs.”  Gevorkyan said that he purchased Bitmain ASIC devices, including the AntMiner S9, in January of this year to mine bitcoin. However, he faced difficulties configuring the devices and it took time to install them.  ""During this time, the ASIC devices were pre-configured to mine and deliver crypto currency to Defendant. Also during this time, the ASIC devices operated at full power mode, consuming a substantial amount of electricity at Plaintiffs’ expense,"" the complaint states.  It further adds that this “unfair business practice” by Bitmain continued until the ASIC devices were linked with Gevorkyan's personal cryptocurrency account.  As a result, Gevorkyan and the other members are seeking “full restitution of all expenses incurred as a result of Bitmain’s unfair and deceptive practices” and an order requiring Bitmain to “cease the acts of unfair competition alleged”, as well as interest at the highest rate allowable and other fees and costs.  In summary, the complaint said:  ""Conveniently, Bitmain cashes in on every second it takes to get the ASIC configured with the customers’ specifications and lays the substantial costs of operating the ASIC devices at the feet of its customers.""  ""Bitmain does not mine with customers' equipment and, considering that mining for itself is a small part of Bitmain's business, it has less incentive to do so compared to shipping the equipment as soon as possible to fulfill any confirmed orders,"" the firm said in an email to CoinDesk.  Earlier this month, Bitmain itself filed a suit against an anonymous thief in a U.S. federal court who allegedly stole 617 bitcoin from an account it holds at crypto exchange Binance.

42402284,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3m0z,1543232712,Up 15%: Bitcoin's Price Bounces Back After 14-Month Low,"Bitcoin's 15-percent recovery from the 14-month low hit yesterday may have opened the doors for short-term price consolidation.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value dropped through the support of the trendline connecting the August 2015 and August 2016 lows and fell to $3,474 yesterday – the lowest level since Sept. 17, 2017 (prices as per Bitstamp). At that level, BTC was down 38 percent from the highs above $6,300 seen two weeks ago.  The drop was short-lived, however, and prices closed yesterday (as per UTC) at $3,939 – well above the trendline – validating the oversold conditions reported by the technical indicators. As a result, a bout of consolidation could be in the offing.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $3,920 on Bitstamp, having clocked a high of $4,069 earlier today.  The 15 percent recovery, though, may turn out to be a ""dead cat bounce"" if the long-term trendline support, currently at $3,830 is again breached. Meanwhile, the prospects of a stronger corrective rally would improve if prices find acceptance above $4,000.  4-hour chart  The bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) and the falling channel breakout in the 4-hour chart indicate a bearish-to-bullish trend change. As a result, a stronger recovery rally toward $4,461 (downward sloping 50-candle EMA) cannot be ruled out.  Gains above that level may remain elusive as the stacking order of the 50-candle EMA below the 100-candle EMA, below the 200-candle EMA indicates the path of least resistance is on the downside.  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, the RSI has created a bullish divergence (higher low). That pattern would gain credence if the RSI moves above 30.00 into the undersold territory.  The primary trend, however, would remain bearish as long as both the 5- and 10-day EMAs are sloping downwards.  Weekly chart  As seen in the above chart, BTC is now trapped between the former support-turned-resistance of the 200-week EMA, currently at $4,174, and the three-year-long rising trendline support. Acceptance below the trendline support of $3,830 would invalidate the signs of revival seen in the 4-hour and daily chart.  View  BTC's defense of the long-term trendline support could be a sign the sellers have run out of steam. As a result, prices could consolidate around $4,000 for the next day or two.  A break above the psychological hurdle of $4,000 would add credence to bullish setup on the 4-hour chart and open the doors to $4,500.  On the downside, a move below $3,830 (trendline support) would allow a re-test of yesterday's low of $3,474.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, starting this week, companies in the state will be able to pay a variety of taxes, from tobacco sales tax to employee withholding tax to public utilities tax with the cryptocurrency.  The filing process involves three steps: First, businesses will have to register with the Office of the Ohio Treasurer through a dedicated portal called OhioCrypto.com. They then need to enter tax details such as payment amount and tax period, and, finally, the due amount is paid in bitcoin using a ""compatible"" crypto wallet, according to the portal.  Compatible wallets include the Bitcoin Core client, Mycelium and breadwallet, and others that are compatible with the Bitcoin Payment Protocol.  All tax payments will be processed by Atlanta-based bitcoin payments processor BitPay, which will convert bitcoins to dollars for the Treasurer’s office.  While, for now, the facility is available only for businesses, it is reportedly expected to be made available to individuals in the future.  Lawmakers in other U.S. states have also considered allowing crypto tax payments in the past. Back in March, Illinois and Arizona were both weighing proposals to allow residents to pay their tax bills in bitcoin. Georgia was also considering the option in February.  However, Arizona’s lawmakers scrapped the plan two months later due to insufficient votes for the proposal. Similarly, Georgia’s proposal also stalled in April, due to a “lack of understanding” about cryptocurrency, said Senator Mike Williams at the time.  Ohio has also been working to bring other aspects of blockchain technology into law. Over the summer, the state legally recognized data stored and transacted on a blockchain, meaning electronic signatures secured through blockchain technology have the same legal standing as any other electronic signatures.  In the same month, Ohio lawmakers also pitched their state as a future hub for blockchain, hoping to both attract companies in the space and blockchain talent to the jurisdiction.

42402270,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3lpB,1543222822,"Ripple Is Making It Easier for Customers to Integrate XRP. So Far, They Aren't","Ripple is rolling out a new version of its most popular product, xCurrent.  Positioned as a rival to SWIFT – the 45-year-old messaging network at the center of the global payments infrastructure – version 4.0 of xCurrent is being more closely integrated with Ripple's other major offering, xRapid.  xRapid uses the cryptocurrency XRP to provide what the company calls ""on-demand liquidity"" in cross-border transactions: the ability to use XRP as a bridge currency in the middle of a cross-border payment corridor, which Ripple says eliminates payment processors' need to pre-fund bank accounts in destination countries.  Describing xCurrent 4.0, Ripple SVP of product Asheesh Birla told CoinDesk:  ""What this release enables you to do is that in countries where you think it's appropriate and xRapid's available, using your xCurrent software, you can now plug into on-demand liquidity using xRapid.""  The roll-out of xCurrent 4.0 began in September, a company spokesperson told CoinDesk, and customers – which include American Express, Santander and Itaú – are currently being transitioned to the new version.  Birla did not give an exact timeline for completing the upgrades – he noted that xCurrent is an ""on-premise software package,"" meaning it's tailored to each customer to some extent – but said that any new customers would begin with version 4.0.  Any takers?  Yet the xRapid integration, Birla stressed, is entirely optional.  ""In other countries, where there's not good regulatory clearance or digital asset infrastructure, you just continue to use xCurrent as-is, with fiat liquidity,"" he said.  So far, a Ripple spokesperson told CoinDesk, no xCurrent 4.0 users have opted for xRapid integration.  CoinDesk reached out to several Ripple customers regarding the new version of xCurrent. A BBVA spokesperson said the bank had tested a Ripple product last year, but declined to specify which one or provide an update.  A spokesman at Banco Santander, said the bank ""uses xCurrent only, not xRapid or XRP. And the bank has not upgraded so far."" He added that ""Santander does not need nowadays that upgrade to deliver all the benefits of One Pay FX,"" a mobile payments app.  Ripple announced in October that three companies – MercuryFX, Cuallix and Catalyst Corporate Credit Union – were implementing xRapid for commercial payments.  Under the existing system, Birla said, financial institutions can spend months setting up bank accounts in foreign countries and funding them with enough local currency to provide liquidity.  With xRapid, companies trade the originating country's currency for XRP and then use XRP to purchase the currency of the destination country. ""The feedback so far from our customers,"" he said, ""is using the xRapid experience cuts down on cost, but also cuts down on setup time.""  Independent market makers on cryptocurrency exchanges are needed to provide the liquidity for these transactions. Ripple has partnered with three exchanges – Bittrex, Coins.ph and Bitso – to facilitate xRapid payments between U.S. dollars and Philippine pesos, and U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos.  ""They're two of the larger destinations for payments, and they have good infrastructure,"" Birla said of Mexico and the Philippines, adding, ""we picked those to get started and we want to go from there.""  Multi-hop and bulk FX  Still, the new version of xCurrent offers benefits to customers who have not chosen to integrate xRapid.  Among the most notable improvements in xCurrent 4.0 is a feature called ""multihop,"" which allows payments to be relayed through a chain of xCurrent users. The existing payments system relies on a few large money center banks such as Citi, which act as hubs, Birla said.  Multihop could allow smaller regional players such as Siam Commercial Bank in Thailand to ""get the same sort of reach that a larger correspondent bank can,"" he added.  Given financial institutions' compliance concerns, each ""hop"" along the chain would be approved ahead of time – ""there's never any like, 'surprise!'"" Birla said – but once the software is set up and deployed, the hops themselves happen ""in milliseconds.""  Another improvement, which is aimed specifically at customers not opting to integrate xRapid, is known as ""bulk FX"" (short for foreign exchange). This feature allows customers to buy fiat currencies in bulk, letting them pre-fund foreign bank accounts all at once and provide customers with a consistent exchange rate.  A third feature, known as ""enhanced onward forwarding,"" links xCurrent to local payment rails, such as ACH and its equivalents. That way – in contrast to SWIFT – financial institutions are better able to verify that the payment makes it to the end recipient.  Finally, the new version of xCurrent includes user interface updates that Birla said would make configuring the software less confusing.  xCurrent 4.0 includes a number of enhancements, but cryptocurrency investors are paying attention mainly because enhanced xRapid integration could boost XRP adoption by institutions.  In the first couple of months since the new version's roll-out, however, no new firms have publicly embraced a product promising ""on-demand liquidity.""

42402278,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3lx3,1543208431,"600K Bitcoin Miners Shut Down in Last 2 Weeks, F2Pool Founder Estimates","Between 600,000 and 800,000 bitcoin miners have shut down since mid-November amid declines in price and hashrate across the network, according to the third-largest mining pool.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Mao Shixing, founder of F2pool, said his firm's estimate takes into account the total network hashrate drop and the average hash power of older mining machines that are having a hard time generating profits.  According to data from blockchain.info, the bitcoin network’s entire hashrate, which captures the aggregated computing power on the world’s first blockchain, has dropped from around 47 million tera hashes per second (TH/s) on Nov. 10 to 41 million on Nov. 24 – an almost 13 percent decline.  Mao explained most miners that may have halted operations are likely those using older models, such as the Antminer T9+ made by Bitmain and AvalonMiner 741 by Canaan Creative. These miners have an average hash power of around 10 TH/s and are estimated to be losing money right now, according to F2pool's miner revenue index.  In fact, the bitcoin hashrate on F2pool, which now accounts for about 11.4 percent of the total network, has also seen a decline of over 10 percent in recent weeks, Mao said.  “It’s hard to calculate a precise number of miners connected to us that had unplugged. But we saw over tens of thousands of them [shut down] in the past several days based on conversations we had with larger farms that we are in regular contact with,” he said, adding:  “This is what’s happening among miners in China.”  On Nov. 20, Mao shared via his Weibo social media account a photo of a man packing computer gear into boxes, with the caption ""shutting down is not an option, now have to sell by the kilos.""  The post was widely taken to mean even mining equipment of recent vintage was being sold off by the kilogram in China, but Mao told CoinDesk he was half-kidding when he wrote it, explaining:  “Those miners being sold by the kilos are even older and obsolete models that aren’t usable anymore. So people are selling to recycle [them] like copper instead of for further mining purposes.”  Winter Is Coming  Stepping back, Mao said there are multiple factors that contributed to the shakeout among miners, including the recent market decline that followed the bitcoin cash hard fork on Nov. 15; an increase in electricity costs in China; and the fact that Chinese manufacturers are still racing to upgrade their products, making older machines increasingly uncompetitive.  “All these factors are overlapping right now which led to this recent phenomenon,” Mao said.  As the winter comes in China, hydropower plants are experiencing a dry season when electricity costs have doubled from what they would have been in the summer when water was abundant.  During the summer, Mao said, electricity costs in China’s mountainous Southwestern region, where lots of mining farms reside, could go below 0.2 yuan, or $0.029, per 1 KW/h. But at this time of the year, that is going up to above 0.3 yuan ($0.043).  While other fossil fuel power stations, for instance in China’s Xinjiang province, may generate electricity at a steadier rate, the overall costs are still at least about 0.28 yuan ($0.04) per 1KW/h, Mao said.  As bitcoin's price recently tanked to a 13-month low below $4,000, mining farms that have been using machines made in 2016 and 2017 with lower productivity just can’t break even, Mao added.  To be sure, the fact that mining farms have unplugged does not necessarily mean they are out of the game completely.  “Bitcoin mining is always a dynamically adjusted process,” Mao said, meaning when the hashrate drops, so does the mining difficulty. The latest data shows the bitcoin mining difficulty has already declined slightly by 5 percent within the past a few days.  This dynamically adjusted process could give those who haven't thrown in the towel an incentive to stick around, Mao said, concluding:  “The change of bitcoin’s mining difficulty normally has a lag of about 14 days [following hashrate change]. After this wave of shutdowns, those players who opted to stay in may have a better life.”  Mao Shixing image courtesy to F2pool",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BCH | MINING | TRADING | FORKS,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2018/11/26/600k-bitcoin-miners-shut-down-in-last-2-weeks-f2pool-founder-estimates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cc470ebf1983ee1391dc802286a809f3d7c1d023-800x534.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
