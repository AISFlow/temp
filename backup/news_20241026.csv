Whale‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings have reached 670,000 BTC, the largest accumulation of the digital currency in history. Related Reading: Against All Odds: Solana (SOL) Breaks Past $176 In 3-Month Push Impact Of Whale Accumulation Crypto analysts said that one of the positive impacts of whales buying large volumes of Bitcoin is it helps stabilize the market. As a result, the crypto‚Äôs price could go down a little bit or become more stable. Reducing the volume of Bitcoin in the market could possibly make prices less susceptible to volatility. In previous whale accumulations, it was observed that BTC price usually behaves in a specific way, in which on most occasions, BTC goes flat or slightly decreases. This period of BTC accumulation could also signal that whales have no immediate intent to sell their digital assets. It might be an indicator that whales are looking at capitalizing on Bitcoin in the long term so the accumulation phase is a strategic move. Real Indicator Of Bitcoin Growth CryptoQuant said the whale accumulation could be seen as the ‚Äòcalm before the storm‚Äô in the long term, saying that Bitcoin prices move sideways or experience a moderate fall during the accumulation phase. However, CryptoQuant noted that there is no doubt that in the long run, this is an ‚Äòoptimistic sign.‚Äô Whales‚Äô holdings are at an all-time high ‚ÄúWhales currently hold around 670,000 $BTC, which is the highest value ever.

35182151,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649943,1729980011,Bitcoin Bullish Outlook Confirmed By Critical Data ‚Äì STH Overheating?,"Bitcoin has had a volatile week, with its price fluctuating between a local high of $69,500 and a low of $65,000. Following weeks of strong bullish momentum, the market has now cooled, and BTC is consolidating just below the crucial $70,000 level. This key threshold is seen as a trigger for intensified buying pressure if Bitcoin manages to break above it. Related Reading: Solana Breakout From Bullish Pattern Could ‚ÄòSend SOL To The Moon‚Äô ‚Äì Crypto Analyst According to CryptoQuant data, there‚Äôs still room for further growth, as short-term holder (STH) coins are trading at a 6.2% net asset value (NAV) premium. This premium is often viewed as a gauge of market sentiment, reflecting the optimism of short-term holders who are willing to pay above the current market value to acquire Bitcoin. A higher NAV premium generally suggests that investors expect continued price appreciation and are positioning themselves for future gains. As BTC stabilizes in its current range, all eyes are on the $70,000 mark as a potential breakout level that could pave the way for a fresh rally. With positive market sentiment and supportive data, Bitcoin‚Äôs outlook for the coming weeks remains encouraging, fueled by both technical signals and strong buyer interest. Retail Buying Bitcoin (Again) Bitcoin is experiencing growing demand from short-term holders as its price consolidates below key supply levels, close to all-time highs. Analyst Axler Adler recently shared critical insights on X, showing that Bitcoin‚Äôs net asset value (NAV) premium among short-term holders has climbed to 6.2%. This 6.2% NAV premium indicates that Bitcoin‚Äôs current market price is trading 6.2% above the average acquisition cost for short-term holders. Essentially, these investors are valuing Bitcoin at a premium, suggesting optimism about the potential for further gains. Adler explains that this metric acts as a bullish signal, highlighting room for continued price growth. An NAV premium of 25% or higher typically points to an overheated market, implying that demand has yet to reach excessive levels. According to Adler‚Äôs analysis, the NAV premium is an important gauge of market sentiment. A moderate premium like 6.2% reflects healthy demand among short-term holders, aligning with an accumulation phase rather than a peak. This is especially relevant as Bitcoin‚Äôs price consolidates under significant resistance levels, potentially setting the stage for a breakout. Related Reading: On-Chain Indicator Signals Bitcoin Cycle Top Is Far Ahead ‚Äì Data Confirms Bullish Outlook Bitcoin‚Äôs consolidation below its key supply levels and rising demand among short-term holders reflects a favorable environment for potential price appreciation. If short-term holder demand continues to grow, it could fuel BTC‚Äôs ascent to new highs. The balance between premium demand and manageable NAV levels could signal sustained upward momentum. There is a potential rally on the horizon if buying pressure strengthens at current levels. Technical Level To Watch Bitcoin is trading at $66,900 after establishing solid support around $65,000. The price action signals resilience as it consolidates above this crucial level. This support around $65,000 marks a significant pivot, as holding above it reflects underlying strength and fuels optimism among investors. However, for Bitcoin to keep bullish momentum, a push above $70,000 is essential to confirm the uptrend. If Bitcoin loses the $65,000 level, analysts foresee a retrace toward the 200-day moving average (MA) at $63,274. This level is relevant as a long-term support zone. A pullback to this area could attract new buyers, reinforcing it as a major support if tested. Related Reading: Dogecoin Liquidity Sweep Signals DOGE Is Ready For A Rally Investors view the 200-day MA as a key anchor for Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish structure. If BTC can hold above $65,000 and eventually break $70,000, it would indicate a continuation of the current bullish phase. Conversely, a dip below these supports would shift focus to the 200-day MA. Holding above this moving average is crucial to prevent a bearish reversal.

35179658,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649939,1729974603,Bitcoin Retail lnvestors Remain Cautious Despite Price Gain ‚Äì Details,"Following its bearish start to October, Bitcoin has since shifted momentum, rising as high as $69,000 in the last two weeks. Despite this significant price rally, Bitcoin retail investors remain hesitant to engage the market. In its weekly crypto report on Friday, blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant shared an interesting insight into this low retail activity in the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 70%+ Powerful Bull Wave To Push It Over $100,000, How High Can It Go? Bitcoin Retail Investors‚Äô Holding Grows At Historically Slow Pace ‚Äì Report According to CryptoQuant, retail investors‚Äô holdings have grown by 18,000 BTC valued at $1.2 billion over the last four months reaching a total new value of 1.753 million BTC worth $112.7 billion. While this development demonstrates a rising market interest by these small investors, the analytic firm notes the pace of accumulation is significantly slow compared to historical data as retail investors only acquired a net 1,000 BTC valued at $66.31 million, in the last 30 days. Notably, the retail investor accumulation rate has been on a consistent decline since May 2023, when their holdings rose by 27,000 BTC worth $1.79 billion Therefore, CryptoQuant reports that these Bitcoin individual investors have only increased their investments by 30,000 BTC valued at $1.99 billion in 2024, which pales in comparison to the whale investors whose holdings have grown by 173,000 BTC worth $11.50 billion in the same period. During periods of price gain, low retail investor activity as discussed above can be concerning as it represents decreased market liquidity or even a lack of market confidence in the asset‚Äôs ability to sustain its current bullish trajectory. Alternatively, this lack of interest from small-scale investors also presents positive indications. For example, CryptoQuant reports that low retail activity includes these small investors holding onto their Bitcoin rather than selling. The analytics firm notes that Bitcoin transfer to exchange in January 2023 has decreased from a daily average of 2,700 BTC to 1,400 BTC in 2024, thus there is reduced selling pressure on the token. In addition, transfer activity among retail investors remains low, with transaction volume dropping to $326 million on September 21, the lowest level recorded since 2020. While reduced transfer activity may indicate limited market volatility, CryptoQuant states that low retail activity has historically preceded significant price gains for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at 66,896 following a 1.11% decline in the last day due to reports of an alleged investigation into Tether, the issuer of stablecoin USDT, and conflict in the Middle East. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume is up by 34.29% and is valued at $42.10 billion.

The TD Sequential Suggests So,"Toncoin (TON) has undoubtedly been one of the best performers in the cryptocurrency market in 2024, enjoying a meteoric rise in the first half of the year. However, the altcoin has struggled to keep up the pace just as the other large-cap assets in recent months. In its latest downturn, the Toncoin price lost its hold above the psychological $5 level for the first time in over a month on Friday, October 25. However, a popular analyst on X has predicted that the cryptocurrency may not stay beneath this level for long. Analyst Sounds Buy Alarm For TON ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why In a recent post on X, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that the price of TON might be gearing for a rebound more quickly than anticipated. This positive projection came after the altcoin succumbed to intense bearish pressure to fall below $5. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Flashes Bullish Pennant On Daily Heikin Ashi Chart, What This Means According to Martinez, the ‚ÄúTom Demark‚Äù (TD) Sequential has sounded a buy alarm for the Toncoin price on its 12-hour chart. The TD Sequential, an indicator used in technical analysis, can help traders identify potential points and times of trend exhaustion and price reversal. The TD Sequential is made up of two major phases known as the TD Setup phase and the TD Countdown phase. As shown in the chart below, the price of TON on the 12-hour timeframe appears to have completed the TD Setup phase. The Setup phase comprises nine candles of the same polarity (bearish or bullish). In a bullish Setup phase, the starting number ‚Äú1‚Äù is plotted on a candle that closes higher than the close of the candle four periods prior. A bearish Setup phase, on the other hand, is marked by the starting number ‚Äú1‚Äù on a candle that closes lower than the close of the candle four periods before. A possible point of price reversal can be identified when the TD Sequential plots figure ‚Äú9‚Äù on the top or bottom of a candle in a bullish or bearish trend. As seen in the Toncoin 12-hour chart, the figure ‚Äú9‚Äù appeared on the last bearish candlestick, meaning that altcoin might be gearing up for a rebound. If this projection does hold, investors could see the TON price return to $5 as soon as possible. Toncoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Toncoin stands at around $4.74, reflecting a disappointing 7.4% decline in the past 24 hours. This brings the altcoin‚Äôs wobbly performance on the weekly timeframe to a 10% price fall. Related Reading: Tron Energy Needs Rise 100% In 3 Months: New All-Time High Incoming?

35174917,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649933,1729963858,Analyst Spots New Critical Ethereum Price Levels With Options Expiry Over,"Popular crypto analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe has highlighted vital price levels in the Ethereum (ETH) market following a massive option expiry event. This development comes amidst high whale activity on the Ethereum network. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin And Solana, Is $12,000 Possible? ETH To Break Out At $2,750, Analyst Says On Friday, approximately $1.02 billion worth of Ethereum options contracts were settled with the max pain point established at $2,600. Amidst this massive option expiry, the price of ETH rose by over 3% to trade at $2,547 despite fears of price decline due to increased market volatility. Following this price gain, Van de Poppe states that Ethereum now finds itself between two routes, especially as the ‚Äúmacroeconomic weeks‚Äù approach. Options expire day is done!$ETH bounced upwards, and now the macroeconomic weeks are kicking in. The question is: are we going to see some upward momentum or will it retest $2,000? Testing $2,750 again = breakout. pic.twitter.com/vi3JJ3tNeP ‚Äî Micha√´l van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) October 25, 2024 Notably, the US elections are set to be held in a fortnight, the results of which are expected to wield a significant effect on the crypto market. Moreover, there is still anticipation of a Fed rate cut in November which could avail liquidity for investing in volatile assets such as Ethereum. First, the analyst postulates that ETH could produce an upward momentum reaching $2750, a significant resistance level at which the token has suffered rejection thrice since August. However, van de Poppe predicts if the second-largest cryptocurrency retests at its price zone again, it will result in a breakout rising as high as $3,350. Alternatively, the crypto analyst forecast Ethereum may experience a price drop in line with its current consolidation pattern. In this case, ETH would initially retest at $2,300. However, amidst massive bearish pressure, the altcoin could fall to $2,000.

However, why that hasn‚Äôt been the story for the premier cryptocurrency over the past two weeks seems to be the question on every investor‚Äôs mind. The price of BTC has failed to capitalize on its recent bullish momentum, falling to as low as $65,000 at some point in the past week. Interestingly, the latest on-chain observation suggests that this period of sluggishness might not be over yet for the market leader. Is The Rising Exchange Whale Ratio Bullish Or Bearish? In a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an on-chain analyst pointed out that the Bitcoin ‚ÄúExchange Whale Ratio‚Äù has seen a notable surge in recent weeks. The ‚ÄúExchange Whale Ratio‚Äù metric measures the ratio between the sum of the top 10 largest transfers into centralized exchanges and the total exchange inflow. Related Reading: Bitcoin MACD Turns Bullish Since 2023: Predictions Of Cycle Top And Next Bear Market Bottom For clarity, it is assumed that the 10 largest inflows into exchanges are executed by whales, which are entities that wield significant influence on the market due to their substantial crypto holdings. The Exchange Whale Ratio basically assesses the level of activity of this cohort of investors compared to the rest of the market. A high Exchange Whale Ratio indicates that the top 10 largest exchange inflows dwarves the incoming transfers from the rest of the market. On the other hand, when the value of this metric is low, it suggests that the whales only make up a relatively healthy part of funds flowing into centralized exchanges. According to data from CryptoQuant, the seven-day moving average of Bitcoin‚Äôs Exchange Whale Ratio recently reached its highest value since November 2022. The Quicktake analyst pointed out that the spike in this metric could be bearish for the value of the flagship cryptocurrency, as it implies that whales might be putting a significant amount of selling pressure on the market. Inflows into centralized exchanges typically have a bearish impact on the Bitcoin price, as selling is one of the services offered by these platforms. Moreover, whales moving their funds to trading platforms can set off a sell-off cascade, as other investors often watch their moves due to their market influence. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands around $66,700, reflecting an almost 2% decline in the past 24 hours. This single-day performance underscores how sluggish the premier cryptocurrency has been in recent days. According to CoinGecko data, the price of BTC is down by over 3% in the past week.

35170132,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649927,1729953045,SUI In Bear Territory: RSI Drop Suggests Further Downside Risk,"As SUI dips further into bearish territory, technical indicators are increasingly signaling a challenging path ahead. A key measure, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), has turned negative, suggesting that selling pressure is mounting and that more downside may be on the horizon. With SUI navigating this bearish shift, market participants are keeping a close eye on potential support levels, wondering if the asset can stabilize or if sellers will continue to drive prices lower. This analysis explores SUI‚Äôs recent entry into bearish territory, examining the implications of the RSI‚Äôs downward shift and the potential for more price declines. It also seeks to provide insights into the downside risks facing SUI by assessing key technical indicators and support levels, this piece. Market Overview: SUI‚Äôs Shift Into Bearish Territory On the 4-hour chart, SUI has shown strong bearish momentum, slipping below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it approaches the $1.4 mark printing multiple bearish candlesticks. The 100-day SMA, typically a significant support level, now acts as resistance, signaling a shift in sentiment where sellers have gained the upper hand. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals that the indicator has now dropped to a low 23% level after a previous recovery attempt failed to hold at 52%. With the RSI now in the oversold zone, selling activity may be overextended, unless a significant influx of buying interest appears, SUI could remain under pressure, potentially leading to additional drops. Related Reading: SUI To Face Another Pullback Following 5.3% Dip, Analysts Forecast 30% Correction Also, on the daily chart, SUI is exhibiting a clear pessimistic path as it trends downward toward the $1.4 mark and approaches the 100-day SMA. The $1.4 level, alongside the 100-day SMA, acts as a crucial support area, and a break below these points could reinforce the current downtrend, potentially opening the door to further declines. Lastly, the daily RSI for SUI has dropped to 42%, significantly falling below the critical 50% threshold, which usually separates bullish from bearish territory. Typically, this decline highlights the strong bearish momentum, indicating that sellers are firmly in control and reflecting increasing pessimism about SUI‚Äôs price. Potential Price Targets: How Low Could SUI Go? As SUI continues its negative movement, traders need to pinpoint potential price targets. If the $1.4 support level is breached, SUI could fall to $1.23, where buying interest may resurface. An extended drop below this level could trigger a deeper correction toward other support levels. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Potential Pullback As RSI Flashes Warning: $1.4 Retest In Sight Conversely, should the cryptocurrency manage to hold its position above $1.4, it could indicate a potential reversal, enabling bulls to reclaim some control in the market thereby driving the price higher toward the $2.1 resistance level and beyond.

However, some market watchers shared their worries about the recent retraces, suggesting the cryptocurrency could face another correction ahead of the US Presidential election. Related Reading: Is The Cat Season Here? MEW Hits $1 Billion Market Cap After New ATH Bitcoin To Face Another Shakeout Soon This ‚ÄòUptober,‚Äô Bitcoin has recorded a 12% surge from its opening price, jumping from the $60,000 support level and reclaiming key resistance zones. In the last two weeks, BTC recovered 14% from the early October shakeouts, nearing a retest of the long-awaited $70,000 mark. The cryptocurrency faced major resistance after surging above the $69,000 zone, a level not seen since late July. After the unsuccessful retest, Bitcoin‚Äôs price faced a 5.3% pullback toward the $65,000-$66,000 range, failing to reclaim the $67,000 mark until Thursday. Based on BTC‚Äôs recent performance, some analysts consider that the flagship crypto is poised to face another correction in the coming weeks. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa revealed he is unsure about where Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúextremely chippy conditions‚Äù are headed in the short term. Sherpa shared that the cryptocurrency could see one last shakeout ‚Äúsometime in November.‚Äù He suggested BTC could face another pullback toward the $62,000-$64,000 price range around the time of the US Presidential elections, scheduled for November 5. However, the analyst believes that Bitcoin will continue its bullish rally after the shakeout. Another market watcher also forecasted another correction for BTC‚Äôs near future. Analyst Crypto King stated that BTC is set to close above $70,000 this week before facing rejection from the key level. Following the rejection, Bitcoin would retrace 8% toward $64,000-$65,000, which could propel altcoins to ‚Äústart moving 5-6x from the current position,‚Äù according to the analyst. Is BTC Set For A Green Weekly Close? Despite the rainy forecast, other investors remain bullish on the flagship crypto. Crypto analyst Moustache set the $67,000-$68,000 range as ‚Äúinsanely important support levels.‚Äù To the analyst, if BTC‚Äôs price holds its support there, it will hit $70,000 soon. After Bitcoin jumped above the $68,000 resistance on Friday morning, Crypto Yapper noted that BTC broke out of a weekly bull flag and was ‚Äúready for an exponential move.‚Äù The analyst also asserted that the next horizontal level to break before the $70,000 test is $69,000. Related Reading: Web3 Automation Provider Ava Protocol‚Äôs Demand Surges 900% Ahead Of Token Launch Nonetheless, he stated that Bitcoin should make a higher high to remain bullish. Similarly, Rekt Capital pointed out that BTC‚Äôs old downtrend line is supporting, which serves as post-breakout confirmation. Per the post, the cryptocurrency would record a bullish weekly close above the $66,300 mark. The analyst also highlighted that if BTC closes above the $67,900 zone, It will register a ‚Äúvery bullish weekly close‚Äù ahead of October‚Äôs last week. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $67,737, a mild 0.3% increase in the daily timeframe.

42373489,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmgqn,1729947600,From Smuggling Gold Out of Africa to Bridging Bitcoin and Cardano,"From ages 9 to 11, Edan Yago smuggled gold, hidden in his clothes by his mother, out of South Africa.  The apartheid government had instituted capital controls to stabilize the rand amid international sanctions. The authorities were hunting some of his family members whom it had designated as ""terrorists.""  ‚ÄúEventually, we were forced out of South Africa,‚Äù Yago told CoinDesk in an interview.  His family were no strangers to tyranny. Some relatives had survived the Holocaust; others weren't so lucky.  That background, combined with his education in neuroscience and data science, led him to a career working in Bitcoin, with its value proposition of wealth that governments can't easily confiscate and transactions that central authorities can't veto.  ‚ÄúThroughout, my focus has been on trying to develop tools for greater sovereignty,‚Äù Yago said.  A self-described ""bitcoin accelerationist,"" Yago is the founder of Sovyrn, a decentralized bitcoin lending and trading platform. He is building BitcoinOS, a ""rollup"" stack for the world's largest cryptocurrency designed to process more transactions and more complex operations like smart contracts than the blockchain could handle otherwise.  Technical achievements  In July, BitcoinOS achieved its milestone of verifying a zero-knowledge proof on Bitcoin mainnet. ‚ÄúThis is a big deal,‚Äù Yago said. ‚ÄúWe're building a platform which is going to allow rollups on bitcoin, and through that, allow us to maintain the security of bitcoin without introducing any changes to smart contracts, build scalability and privacy.""  The goal is ""transforming bitcoin into an operating system, not just a system for transacting bitcoin.‚Äù  His team is now working with a company called Emurgo to turn Cardano {{ADA}}, the blockchain whose native ADA token is the 11th-largest cryptocurrency according to CoinDesk data, into a smart contract layer for Bitcoin.  The first technical step will be integrating the BOS Grail bridge with Cardano‚Äôs open-source ecosystem to allow ‚Äútrustless bridging of BTC and Bitcoin assets using BOS‚Äôs ZK-based BitSNARKverification protocol, bringing Bitcoin‚Äôs unparalleled liquidity into Cardano,‚Äù according to a Thursday announcement.  A crypto OG  Yago has been a regular on the blockchain scene for more than a decade. In 2013, at an early Bitcoin conference in San Jose, California, he pitched the idea of a ""cryptocurrency-based political zone."" Three special economic zones in Honduras emerged from that project; they are fighting a legal battle with the government there. The concept was a harbinger of Balaji Srinivasan's network states.  In the years since, the early adopters' lofty visions have been overshadowed by later entrants' obsessions with candlestick charts and Lamborghinis. ‚ÄúThe whole crypto ecosystem‚Äôs challenge is that it's a mixture of high-minded idealism with the most speculative casino stuff and that‚Äôs a difficult thing to navigate,"" Yago told CoinDesk.  Nevertheless, he sees a silver lining in the sleaze.  ""While it's tempting for ideologically driven people to completely reject memecoins, centralized exchanges and all the nonsense that's going on, the truth is that that is a gateway drug for people to actually discover how they can be more in control of their financial lives,‚Äù Yago said.  What's more, he is trying to rehabilitate an idea associated with one of the more unsavory chapters in crypto history.  ICOs redux  Yago said he wants to form a ‚Äúcoalition of established DeFi‚Äôs and crypto companies to bring back the age of initial coin offerings.‚Äù  As then-CoinDesk columnist David Z. Morris wrote last year, the 2017 ICO boom was an ‚Äúorgy of fraud and scammy behavior‚Äù but it also ‚Äúfunded many crypto success stories.‚Äù  Yago said it is no longer necessary to issue tokens through centralized entities. The correct way is through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), ones that are decentralized in more than name.  ‚ÄúImagine if large collectives or DAOs or, say, six projects come together and say 'This is important for us to preserve the privacy of our users so we are launching a crypto application or project together,'"" he said. ""The SEC can try and figure out who's to blame. That‚Äôs the secret. We don‚Äôt need to fight it directly.‚Äù The arrest of Tornado Cash co-founder Alexey Pertsev has not deterred Yago because ‚ÄúTornado Cash still works,‚Äù he said.  Neither has North Korea‚Äôs use of Tornado Cash to launder funds. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not taking casualties, you‚Äôre not fighting,"" Yago said. ""The cost of an open society with freedom of speech is that sometimes a terrorist will find the book which teaches him how to make an explosive.""",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/26/from-smuggling-gold-out-of-africa-to-bridging-bitcoin-and-cardano,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/678e8b170d604bc44e78f759f1cbdad8603962dc-1207x679.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If there is any fundamental value in DOGE beyond the meme, it's when transaction fees spike on the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Blockchain. Which appears to be starting to happen once again. Historically, daily active addresses on Dogecoin lead price higher. We're seeing active addresses start to move up. I don't currently have an active DOGE position on. But it's not something that I'm ruling out in the instance of a deeper pullback to the coin's 50 day MA. My history with Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) on Seeking Alpha is not one of admiration. In December 2023, I was highly bearish the coin and called DOGE my top crypto bear pick for 2023. More recently, I upgraded the coin to 'hold' and noted that despite what I view to be a somewhat pointless coin, the power of the meme was no longer something I felt made sense to fade. Data by YCharts That turned out to be a well-timed pivot as DOGE rallied more than 100% shortly after the upgrade. Currently, we find DOGE well off those highs from March of this year but ahead of the August lows of 8 cents. In this update, we'll take a look at key metrics from the network and the technical setup that can be currently viewed in the price. Network Metrics Two of the primary ways we analyzed DOGE in my late-February piece was through active address data and fee data. Fees are important because they show network usage through ledger validation revenue and daily active addresses are important because they show the closest thing we have to users. On that latter point, daily active addresses are not - and should not be viewed as - a viable 'unique users' comparison because one person can operate several different addresses. Regardless, to be bullish the broader Dogecoin network, DOGE holders would theoretically want to see active addresses and fees both increase in tandem. Dogecoin Fees vs FD Cap (Token Terminal) The chart above shows the full history of Dogecoin network fees on a monthly basis. When I last covered Dogecoin, monthly fees were on the rise. In February, fees eclipsed $462k for the month. This is still well below what could reasonably be considered a robust fee market compared to other public blockchain networks. But the main takeaway is that early 2024 fees were a flash in the pan. The network has been averaging about $70k in monthly fees between August and October. This is off the highs from the spring but actually well ahead of the 2023 averages. Switching gears to daily actives, I've added the coin price to the chart and below and we're looking at both price and daily active address count through a 30 day average: 30 Day Average Price vs DAAs (CoinMetrics) What I find interesting about this chart is over the last 5 years we've generally seen starts and peaks in active addresses lead price. In early 2021 active address growth lead coin price between March and May. It happened again between November 2023 and March 2024. The same appears to be happening again with Dogecoin active addresses grinding higher by about 20% starting at the beginning of September. The question is do we have a viable catalyst for a larger sustained move in daily active addresses on Dogecoin? Frankly, I think it comes down to the network usability of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). BTC Median TX Fee (30 Day average) (CoinMetrics) In the past, we've generally needed large fee spikes on Bitcoin to get big moves higher in daily active addresses on smaller proof-of-work blockchains. In the chart above, we can see the median transaction fee on Bitcoin started to move higher at the beginning of October. I'm certainly not going to try to predict that this will be the time the Bitcoin fee market grows sustainably, but I suppose anything is possible. Technical Opinion The most straight forward way to look at altcoin charts is to examine the dollar-denominated price levels against moving averages. My assessment of DOGE in this manner is actually somewhat bullish: DOGE Daily Chart (TrendSpider) The daily chart above shows a a coin that has battled trend line resistance from spring of this year, broken that trend, back-tested it, and achieved a subsequent new high since August. Furthermore, the 200 day moving average has been taken out as well. Such analysis is fine but it doesn't always make the case that longing an altcoin is a good idea if it can't realistically be expected that the coin in question will outperform Bitcoin. Below I'm showing peaks the DOGE/BTC ratio over the last five years: DOGE/BTC Ratio (TrendSpider) The number of the ratio itself is a bit dubious to even share as it has so many zeroes following the decimal. The better way to measure it is to do so in Satoshis, or ""sats."" Currently, it takes about 200 sats to buy 1 DOGE. On the chart above, I've drawn a trend line from the long term high of 1,287 sats in May 2021 down to today. This line has served as resistance on each subsequent pop in the price of DOGE. That changed in September when the ratio moved above trend. We now find the ratio battling to take out the 50 week MA at 208 sats. In a broader crypto rally, I could very easily see a pop to 253 sats - which previously served as support before breaking down. But again, as is the case with transaction fees on Bitcoin, we're guessing. Closing Thoughts When it comes to crypto, I've tried to look for fundamental reasons to be bullish a network, coin, or token. As is often the case, the fundamental thesis for DOGE is not all that straight forward. The coin has survived far longer than I believed it could as little more than a ""meme."" We could argue that the joke seems to be increasingly less funny as the years go on. Regardless, where I think DOGE does have some fundamental value is in an environment where fees on Bitcoin make the network unusable for most holders. This has proven to lead to surges in usage for other PoW networks and Dogecoin is one of them. Those Bitcoin fees appear to be spiking again. And we know that daily active address increases typically lead price with DOGE. It's a gamble and guess, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see a 25% pop in the DOGE/BTC ratio. That would take DOGE from 200 sats to 250 sats. At a BTC price of $67k, we get a 250 sat price of nearly $0.17 for DOGE. It's not a terrible trade if one chooses to put it on. I don't currently have an active DOGE position on. But it's not something that I'm ruling out in the instance of a deeper pullback to the 50 day MA.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4729843-dogecoin-this-dog-wants-to-run-doge-usd-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35167752.jpeg

Against The Backdrop Of Legal Developments The surge in active sending addresses comes at a time when the altcoin is seeing some notable developments in its ongoing legal battles. Recently, XRP scored a significant legal victory when a court filing confirmed that XRP is not considered a security. This ruling marked a major turning point in the long-standing legal dispute between Ripple Labs and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

35163456,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649821,1729936819,Bitcoin Bull Run Not Over Yet? This Ratio Has Just Seen A Golden Cross,"Data shows the ratio between two Bitcoin on-chain metrics has recently formed a pattern that has historically been bullish for the asset‚Äôs price. Bitcoin LTH/STH SOPR Ratio Has Crossed Above Its 90-Day MA Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed about the recent trend in the Bitcoin SOPR Ratio. The ‚ÄúSpent Output Profit Ratio‚Äù (SOPR) is an indicator that tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors as a whole are selling at a profit or loss. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average holder is making BTC transactions at a net profit. On the other hand, it being under the mark implies loss-taking is dominant on the network. Related Reading: Dogecoin Surges 16%, But Here‚Äôs What DOGE ‚ÄòRisk Indicator‚Äô Says About Rally The SOPR Ratio, the actual metric of interest here, keeps track of the ratio between the version of the SOPR specifically for short-term holders and that for long-term holders. Short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs) are the two main divisions of the Bitcoin userbase made on the basis of holding time. The cutoff between these cohorts is 155 days, with investors who hold past this mark moving from the STHs to the LTHs. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR Ratio and its 90-day moving average (MA) over the history of the cryptocurrency: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin SOPR Ratio has seen a surge recently, which suggests the LTHs have been ramping up their profit-taking compared to the STHs. This trend is something that has historically been witnessed during bullish periods, since the LTHs are resolute entities who tend to amass large profits by the time the bull run hits in full swing. The STHs are by definition the holders who bought within the past five months, meaning that their cost basis lies somewhere around the prices that BTC was trading at inside this window. Thus, their profits are never as big as the LTHs, who often have their cost basis close to bear market lows. This is why the ratio blows up toward the LTHs in bullish periods. With the latest increase, the SOPR Ratio has reached a value of 1.8 and has surpassed its 90-day MA. In the chart, the CryptoQuant author has highlighted the past instances of this crossover. It would appear that this pattern has generally proven to be bullish for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Is It Too Late To Accumulate Bitcoin? What This Indicator Says Naturally, the profit-taking from the LTHs can be a concern, but as is apparent from the graph, the cycle has usually only been at risk of topping out when the ratio has broken above a value of 7. Thus, there could still be plenty of room to run for Bitcoin, with demand potentially absorbing the LTH profit-taking until the same extreme levels as the past cycles. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $68,200, up more than 1% over the last 24 hours.

35160858,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649864,1729931402,Ethereum Netflow Spikes To Derivatives Markets ‚Äì Is a Price Swing on the Horizon?,"Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a lackluster phase in recent weeks, with the asset seeing small price surges but still struggling to hold near or above the $3,000 mark after a brief rally in August. According to a recent analysis from a CryptoQuant analyst, the behind the scenes of this price struggle for ETH has been quite interesting, with the asset seeing a significant shift in its netflow. This shift in Ethereum‚Äôs netflow could have significant implications for ETH, potentially influencing the market‚Äôs reaction positively or negatively. Related Reading: Ethereum ‚ÄòVerge‚Äô Upgrade To Simplify Running Nodes On Phones And Wearables Dissecting The Ethereum Netflow The CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha revealed in a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform that Ethereum has recently experienced a spike in netflows, with approximately 96,000 ETH moving into derivative exchanges. According to Taha, this influx could indicate that traders are positioning for potential price shifts, as large transfers to derivatives platforms have historically preceded periods of increased volatility or even corrections. Taha‚Äôs analysis, backed by previous spikes in May and early July, suggests that Ethereum‚Äôs current activity might foreshadow a heightened period of market movement. The analyst wrote: The latest spike in netflow could signal another period of heightened market activity, potentially a price correction or a sharp move based on trader positioning. Market Sentiment Drawn From Bitcoin In addition to Ethereum‚Äôs netflows, Taha delved into Bitcoin‚Äôs Futures Sentiment Index, observing that this metric shows peaks in sentiment that may serve as indicators of broader market behavior. He pointed out three instances where the sentiment index spiked, marked by red-circled peaks (in the chart above), each time coinciding with a local market top. This trend implies that, following peaks in trader sentiment, Bitcoin‚Äôs price typically experiences a decline. The sentiment index, thus, can serve as a ‚Äúcontrarian indicator‚Äù‚Äîwhen optimism peaks, price corrections often follow. These sentiment patterns may signal that investors should brace for potential volatility for Ethereum, which is highly correlated with Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Faces Key Hurdles: Can It Break Through? Meanwhile, Ethereum has continued to hover somewhere below $3,000. So far, the asset has registered a correction in the past week, dropping by 3.1%. However, the past day performance is attempting to be more positive. Over this period, Ethereum has seen a slight increase of 0.9%, rising to as high as $2,559 earlier today before now trading for $2,541, at the time of writing. Despite the notable fluctuation the asset has seen in the past week alone, rising to above $2,700 and dropping below $2,500, Ethereum daily trading volume seems to have maintained composure. Data from Coingecko shows that this metric has remained between $15 billion and $19 billion in the past week with no major spike or decline.

35158223,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649851,1729926032,"Bitcoin To $100,000 By February 2025? Analyst Explains Why","The current trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC) prices could push it to the $100,000 mark within the next 90 days, regardless of the results of the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin At $100,000 By February 2025? Crypto analyst Timothy Peterson suggests that BTC‚Äôs current price movement is not substantially different from previous trends, raising questions about the ‚Äúdiminishing marginal returns‚Äù theory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Towards $68K Amid Microsoft‚Äôs BTC Investment SEC Filing From an investor‚Äôs perspective, Bitcoin‚Äôs diminishing marginal returns theory implies that each halving cycle leads to smaller successive price gains, as the digital asset‚Äôs total market cap matures and its supply shocks have a reduced impact on driving up demand. This suggests that while BTC may continue to grow, the extraordinary returns seen in early cycles could decrease over time. However, Peterson‚Äôs assessment appears to dismiss this theory. To recall, BTC made its all-time high (ATH) of $73,737 in March 2024. Since then, the leading cryptocurrency has been consolidating for almost eight months in a wide price range, reaching as low as $54,000. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $67,998, about 10% lower than its ATH. Peterson argues that BTC‚Äôs movement just above the red trendline would put the digital asset at $100,000 within 90 days. The analyst added that such a move will be ‚Äúcompletely within reason.‚Äù He added: A conservative scenario puts bitcoin at $100k around February. I think this happens regardless of the US election outcome. Furthermore, the analyst suggested that according to other data-driven metrics he‚Äôs monitoring, BTC is not overpriced at its current market valuation, and the probability of a drop below $60,000 is increasingly unlikely. Focus On BTC Year-End Price Predictions While Peterson envisions BTC nearing $100,000 within three months, other analysts and industry insiders have varying expectations. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Peak Around $200,000 In Next 18 Months: CleanSpark CEO Tells Why For instance, options market traders expect BTC to break through its previous ATH by November end, no matter who becomes the next US president. Similarly, in a recent client memo, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan outlined several factors that could force BTC to ‚Äúmelt-up‚Äù to $80,000 in Q4 2024. These factors include the potential victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump, additional interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), and an extended period free of major negative developments in the crypto sector. Besides the aforementioned factors, the optimism toward a year-end BTC rally is also fueled by rising retail demand for the premier digital asset. Recent analysis by CryptoQuant highlighted that Bitcoin transactions worth less than $10,000 are on an uptrend, indicating renewed retail demand as the market gradually pivots from risk-off to risk-on mode. BTC trades at $67,998 on the daily chart at press time, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

35155523,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649843,1729920653,"Ethereum Underperforming, Don‚Äôt Blame The Network Or Leadership: Here‚Äôs Why","Ethereum is the laggard in this bullish cycle. When Bitcoin soared to register fresh all-time highs, easing past $70,000 in March, ETH prices struggled to break $4,000. When it did, the best the coin could do was retest $4,100 before dumping hard. In the past seven months, after the second most valuable coin registered 2024 highs, it is down nearly 40%. Considering its performance over the past three months, there are concerns that Ethereum could post even more losses. Technically, this may be the case should it fail to breach $3,000 in the coming sessions. Don‚Äôt Blame Ethereum Or Its Leaders For ETH‚Äôs Underperformance Taking to X, one analyst thinks ETH is trailing Bitcoin, Solana, and even Tron, not because of how the network is designed or its leadership. In his view, the dismal performance over the past seven months concerns the ‚Äúuninformed‚Äù investors. Related Reading: Is The Cat Season Here? MEW Hits $1 Billion Market Cap After New ATH Admittedly, after prices peaked in March, Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation have been offloading their stash. According to Dune, the foundation has been transferring coins regularly. On September 6, they moved 1,000 ETH when the coin changed hands at $2,300. Most of these coins were sent to exchanges for liquidation. Although Buterin sells ETH from time to time, the co-founder has been selling meme coins heavily and donating to various charities across the globe. Usually, whenever a senior executive or foundation sells, it is bearish. However, pointing to the analyst‚Äôs assessment, their actions, including many others centered on network improvement, aren‚Äôt a big concern. ETH To Be A Better Store Of Value Than Bitcoin For Growth? The analyst on X thinks ETH is falling because investors lack knowledge about the project‚Äôs fundamental strengths. Most importantly, the argument is that ETH can be a better store of value than gold. The observer insists that Ethereum and Bitcoin compete, and claiming otherwise is a mistake. Both of these networks want to dominate the market eventually. Related Reading: Dogecoin Surges 16%, But Here‚Äôs What DOGE ‚ÄòRisk Indicator‚Äô Says About Rally So far, Bitcoin is the most valuable. On the other hand, Ethereum is the most active smart contracts platform, offering more versatility and is ‚Äúricher‚Äù than the first blockchain. For ETH to grow in strength, it must establish itself as a superior store of value, better than Bitcoin. This will require the network to have strong supply dynamics and a greater focus on finance as a primary use case. Once this happens, ETH will be more attractive not only to investors but also to developers. For now, Ethereum is growing in strength, looking at ETH net deflation since EIP-1559, looking at UltraSound Money. At the same time, its roll-up ecosystem is booming, scaling the mainnet. Altogether, the coin could benefit in the long-term, pushing valuation higher.

As of July 15th, both cryptos were up 50% YTD, but Ethereum has since lost most gains while Bitcoin continued to rally. The Bitcoin to Ethereum ratio has widened to just under 27, a level not seen in over three years, highlighting Bitcoin's recent dominance. In the crypto space, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) are considered two of the most credible with market caps of $1.3 trillion and $300 billion, respectively. While there is a tendency for many investors/speculators to lump the two together as highly correlated to each other, that has been far from the case over the last several months. Until mid-summer, Bitcoin and Ethereum followed similar paths, but since then, the paths of the two have diverged. The chart below shows the YTD performance of both cryptos and as recently as July 15th, both were up an identical 50% YTD. Since then, though, Ethereum has given up most of its YTD gains while Bitcoin has added modestly to its rally. Given the divergence between the two, the ratio of bitcoin to Ethereum has widened to just under 27, which is a level not seen in more than three years. As shown in the chart below, this is still half of where the ratio was in early 2021 (it was even higher than that in 2000), but in the short term, Bitcoin has become the ""Mag 1"" of the crypto space.

Mindshare (a measure of the percentage of crypto discussions a coin commands) has remained high. For Deutscher, the increasing attentiveness on Solana is a sign that there is even more room for growth, contrary to the prevailing tendency in the market. Although some investors are wary, experts say the technical terrain is still favorable. If the item breaks over its barrier, the optimistic pennant formation in SOL‚Äôs price action usually denotes more gains.

35150028,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649809,1729909813,FET Price Under Pressure: RSI Flags Extended Bearish Move Toward $0.966,"FET is facing strong downward pressure as bearish signals take hold, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggesting further weakness could be on the horizon. Recent declines have pushed FET‚Äôs price closer to key support levels, and the RSI‚Äôs current reading hints at a continuation of the bearish trend. With a potential drop toward the $0.966 target, investors are left wondering if FET can find a bottom or if additional losses lie ahead. This article analyzes the recent downward pressure on FET‚Äôs price, with a particular focus on the pessimistic signals indicated by the RSI. By examining the current market conditions, key support and resistance levels, and the RSI‚Äôs implications, we‚Äôll explore whether the token will likely continue its decline toward the $0.966 target or if a potential reversal could be on the way. What The RSI Reveals For FET On the 4-hour chart, FET has demonstrated pronounced bearish momentum, slipping below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it approaches the $0.966 mark. This movement below the 100-day SMA signals that negative forces are currently outweighing bullish attempts at price recovery, possibly opening the door to further declines. An analysis of the 4-hour chart reveals that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has now declined to the 34% level following an earlier attempt to rally that stalled at 46%. An RSI near 30% often suggests a potential reversal could be imminent. However, in this context, it may also signal the continuation of a bearish path unless buying interest returns to support a rebound. Related Reading: FET Teeters At Trendline: Will A Breakout Fuel A Run To $1.86? Meanwhile, on the daily chart, FET is displaying notable pessimistic movement as it tries to fall below the 100-day SMA. This downturn highlights rising selling pressure and negative market sentiment, which collectively heightens the probability of the asset dropping below the SMA and heading toward the $0.966 mark. A successful breach of the 100-day SMA could signal additional declines, pushing the price down to this critical support level. Finally, the 1-day RSI shows that negative pressure on FET is intensifying as the signal line has recently dropped below 50%, now settling at 39%. As the RSI remains in this lower range, it suggests that sellers are gaining dominance, potentially paving the way for further drops unless buying momentum can return to shift the sentiment. Key Support Levels: Can $0.966 Hold Against The Bears? As FET‚Äôs price remains under downward pressure, the $0.966 mark stands out as a crucial support level. If the price breaks below this threshold, it may signal a strong correction, possibly resulting in more decrease toward the $0.459 level and beyond. Related Reading: FET On Fire With 27% Rally, Analysts See Bigger Gains Ahead Conversely, if the token manages to hold its position above $0.966, it could indicate a potential reversal, enabling bulls to reclaim some control in the market and driving the price higher toward the $1.86 resistance level and beyond.

Taking note of Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price movements, a crypto analyst has suggested that the pioneer cryptocurrency could be gearing up for a strong bull wave that could drive its price by over 70%, pushing it past the $100,000 milestone. Here‚Äôs How High An Analyst Project‚Äôs Bitcoin‚Äôs Next Price Popular crypto analyst, Javon Marks revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post on Thursday that Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price movements were signaling an impending bull rally. The analyst observed that Bitcoin‚Äôs current market conditions resemble past patterns and trends. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $10,000: Symmetrical Triangle Breakout Predicts Big Gains Marks presented a detailed chart depicting Bitcoin‚Äôs price action from 2023 till date. The analyst noted that the Bitcoin price had formed a Hidden Bull Divergence pattern in 2023, spanning from February to November. Similarly, the cryptocurrency is currently developing another Hidden Bullish Divergence pattern, beginning at the start of the beginning of the year and appearing to extend towards year-end. Based on these parallel price movements, Marks suggests that Bitcoin is poised for a significant rally to new highs soon. The analyst projects that Bitcoin‚Äôs next target is presently 70% above its current price, with the potential to surge as high as $116,652 as it experiences one of the most explosive bull waves ever seen. From Mark‚Äôs X post, it can be seen that the analyst has consistently projected the $116,600 price target for Bitcoin. His earliest Bitcoin prediction of this all-time high was on September 12, when he claimed that Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to over $116,600 was still 100% away. Mark‚Äôs unwavering confidence in this price target suggests a strong conviction that Bitcoin is poised to reach a new ATH this cycle. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $67,601, marking a 1.31% increase in the last 24 hours and a 5.86% increase over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin Price Could Jump Even Higher Than $116,000 Another well-known crypto analyst, identified as ‚ÄòYoddha‚Äô on X has presented a Bitcoin price chart highlighting its next bullish price target.

This price surge is expected to occur around 2025 when the bull market is fully underway. Conversely, Elja, a market expert on X, has projected a more conservative price target for Bitcoin, expecting the cryptocurrency to soar to a new ATH of around $94,000.
