42375144,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5qcb,1646953517,Vitalik Buterin Asks Court for Leniency in Upcoming Sentencing of Virgil Griffith,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has added his voice to the chorus of people asking a federal court in New York for leniency in the upcoming sentencing of former Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith.  Griffith was arrested in November 2019 after giving a presentation on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology at a North Korean crypto conference in April of that year. He was charged with violating U.S. sanctions law and, in September 2021, pleaded guilty in an agreement with federal prosecutors that could see him serve up to 6.5 years in prison.  In a letter to U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York, Buterin detailed his seven-year friendship with Griffith, with whom he met in 2013 and began collaborating on research in 2016. In 2018, Griffith formally joined Ethereum as a developer after Buterin said he “convinced him to agree.”  Buterin wrote about Griffith’s kind and peaceful nature – which also played heavily in many of the nearly 40 other letters written to Castel from Buterin’s family, friends and community members, including a homeless man Griffith met at a Waffle House while on bail in Alabama in 2020. The man’s letter to the court credits Griffith with helping him get a general educational development (GED) degree and finding steady work as a barber.  “Virgil sees the good in everyone [except] spiders. They make him jumpy,” the man, Eugene Hays, wrote to Castel.  That goodness, Buterin wrote, “left a lasting legacy in the Ethereum Foundation and the wider community,” as well as on Buterin himself.  “[Griffith] has also left some deep personal changes in myself,” Buterin wrote Castel. “His attitudes and actions over the years helped to foster an open-mindedness and an orientation towards cooperation that guide my actions to this day, in a way that was absent from my personality five years ago.”  Buterin also described Griffth’s curiosity about other cultures, which led him to move to Singapore in 2016 and his work to make Ethereum compatible with Islamic finance law.  Though Buterin did not directly connect this curiosity to Griffith’s decision to travel to North Korea, Griffith’s lawyer wrote that the trip was “the culmination of Virgil’s unique and unfortunate curiosity and obsession with North Korea.”  In a letter from Griffith himself to the judge, he writes: “I became obsessed with seeing the country before it fell, akin to someone offered the chance to see East Berlin in its final days before the Wall came down.”  Griffith’s lawyers, as well as his loved ones, said they hope his remorse will earn him a shorter sentence.  They have asked the court to consider allowing him to serve a two-year sentence and allowing him to receive credit for time served in jail and a period of three years’ supervised release, including 270 days of home detention.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/10/vitalik-buterin-asks-court-for-leniency-in-upcoming-sentencing-of-virgil-griffith,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69ce676974db09b5890fbee2b61a5d3e645c9739-4000x2668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Is The Only Scarce Asset Bitcoin&apos;s scarcity has often been one of the strongest arguments for the value of the cryptocurrency.

The firm's long list of tech investments includes Shopify (SHOP), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Pinterest (PINS).  The Bessemer commitment comes as an increasing number of well-established venture capital firms have been entering the crypto space, such as Sequoia Capital and Bain Capital.  “It’s clear that we’re now at the onset of the next seismic shift: a new iteration of the web built on blockchain technology. Web 3 is an ecosystem that we believe has several decades of transformation ahead of it, and one we’re passionate about partnering with the most talented founders forging this new future,” wrote the Bessemer team in the announcement blog post.  The firm has also launched BessemerDAO, a Web 3 community for founders, creators and operators. BessemerDAO is meant to connect members of the crypto community for idea sharing, business development and tokenomics. The effort won’t be decentralized at first with Bessemer partners making decisions for the DAO, but the firm plans for the effort to become decentralized over time.  Bessemer isn’t new to crypto investing, having backed NYDIG back in 2017 when the firm was offering institutional custody services for bitcoin. Other notable crypto company investments have included digital art marketplace MakersPlace, fantasy football game Sorare and blockchain intelligence company TRM Labs.

In exchange for their financial contributions, investors receive cryptocurrency. In many ways, an ICO is the cryptocurrency equivalent of a stock exchange initial public offering (IPO) While ICOs have the potential to make a lot of money, their lack of regulation makes them extremely dangerous.

The only issue is that you need people&apos;s money to create the currency. Then there comes the initial coin offering. Here&apos;s how it works. You create a document outlining exactly how the system would function (typically referred to as a white paper), design a nice website, and explain why it&apos;s a great idea that could be very useful. Then you ask people to send you money (usually Bitcoin or Ether, but you can also accept fiat) in exchange for DenCoin - they hope that DenCoin will be widely used and in high circulation, increasing the currency&apos;s value.

The Labor Department said it has become aware in the last few months of firms marketing crypto investments to 401(k) plans as investment options, according to a statement Thursday.  “At this early stage in the history of cryptocurrencies, the Department has serious concerns about the prudence of a fiduciary’s decision to expose a 401(k) plan’s participants to direct investments in cryptocurrencies, or other products whose value is tied to cryptocurrencies,” the Labor Department wrote.  The Labor Department said crypto presents “significant risks and challenges to participants’ retirement accounts, including significant risks of fraud, theft and loss.” It highlighted as reasons speculation and volatility, challenges to making informed investment choices, custodial and record-keeping concerns, the lack of reliability of cryptocurrency valuations and an evolving regulatory environment.  Consequently, the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) plans to “take appropriate action to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to these investments,” according to the statement. Those actions would include questioning plan sponsors that offer crypto investments how they can handle the highlighted risks.  U.S. President Joe Biden signed a first-of-its-kind executive order on cryptocurrencies on Wednesday, directing federal agencies to coordinate their approach to the sector.

Geopolitical uncertainty has kept investors on edge, especially as Russia attacks on Ukraine intensify. Meanwhile, talks between diplomats have faltered, as the two sides didn't reach an agreement on a cease-fire on Thursday.  On the macro front, the European Central Bank announced its plans to phase out of its bond-buying program by September, which could lead to higher interest rates. John Hardy, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Saxo Bank, described the announcement as a ""game-changer"" in a note on Thursday, pointing to growing pressure on central banks to combat inflation by tightening monetary policy, which could weigh on speculative assets.  Cryptos and stocks were slightly lower on Thursday, while oil prices declined. Traditional safe havens such as gold and the U.S. dollar traded higher.  Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) experienced less selling pressure relative to bitcoin (BTC) on Thursday. Ether (ETH) is down 3% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 6% decline in BTC. Meanwhile, STX, the native token of the Stacks network that is used to fuel smart contracts, rose by as much as 20% on Thursday.

Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Shifting correlations  Bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 has risen over the past year, partly because of the increase in volatility in assets around the world. Typically, high volatility coupled with rising inflation causes a positive shift in correlations, especially between stocks and bonds.  Investors tend to reduce their exposure to risk during times of market stress. And the rising correlation between the S&P 500 and bitcoin could point to a broader shift away from speculative assets.  This time, however, rising inflation is thrown into the mix. Commodities, a traditional inflation hedge, tend to rally during the start of an inflationary cycle. Therefore, the correlation between bitcoin and commodities collapsed in recent months to more normal levels (zero correlation).  A surge in demand for speculative assets occurred after the March 2020 market sell-off, and at the present time, the macroeconomic environment has caused investors to unwind their risky bets. That could point to a period of lower returns for both equities and cryptocurrencies.  Chart below was created using Koyfin, a financial data platform.  Altcoin roundup  THORChain’s RUNE surged 37% after DeFi synthetic assets goes live: Cross-chain protocol THORChain went live with synthetic assets trading on its platform Wednesday night, causing prices of its native token, RUNE, to jump as much as 37% from Wednesday's low of $4.05 to Thursday's peak of $5.56. Its trading volume rose 93% in the past 24 hours. In this case, the synthetic assets – or blockchain-based representations of another asset – are backed by half the value of their underlying asset and half in RUNE. That allows users to hold and trade a representative of a layer 1, or base, blockchain asset faster and at a lower cost, according to CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa. Read more here.  Fantom-based Algo protocol Fantasm exploited for $2.6M: Fantom-based algorithmic assets protocol Fantasm Finance was exploited for over $2.6 million worth of crypto early on Thursday, with the stolen tokens swapped for ether using privacy protocol Tornado Cash. “Our FTM collateral reserve has been exploited, there is still 1,820,012 FTM pool balance remaining currently for redemption,” the project's leaders tweeted.

JustCarbon, Likvidi launch blockchain markets for carbon credits: JustCarbon and Likvidi both announced the start of trading platforms for tokenized carbon credits, giving participants the ability to trade greenhouse gas emissions and lower their carbon footprints. JustCarbon opened a marketplace for its JustCarbon Removal Units (JCRs), it said Thursday. Likvidi announced a platform for its Liquid Carbon Credit (LCO2) on Wednesday. Both LCO2 and JCRs are blockchain versions of carbon credits issued by Verra (VCS). JCRs also represent credits issued by Gold Standard. Each is equivalent to 1 metric ton of carbon, according to CoinDesk’s Will Canny. Read more here.

Bitcoin is the most well-known, valuable, and well-established virtual currency. For a variety of reasons, cryptocurrency is preferred over traditional currencies. They are easy to use, with low fees, no government regulations, and complete control. Cryptocurrencies are a popular and decentralized option, but they also pose a security risk. It is the responsibility of the owner to keep them secure. A new generation of software has emerged that looks for the digital wallet where virtual currencies are kept. If your cryptocurrency is lost or stolen, there is no one to contact. Many crypto enthusiasts who are concerned about security have turned to cold storage to keep their coins safe.It is widely used by major cryptocurrency exchanges as well as some of the most successful companies operating in the space behind the best cryptocurrency stocks. What is cold storage in Cryptocurrencies? When cryptocurrency is not in use, it is kept in cold storage. Every cryptocurrency wallet, whether it is for Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, has a private and public key. Cold storage helps to protect your crypto assets against hacker and malware attacks.

42411511,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSmn,1646939394,Executing on Biden's Crypto Executive Order,"Relief and applause followed U.S. President Joe Biden’s executive order on crypto, issued Wednesday. The consensus of all the opinions in the aftermath is that the order represents a major milestone, a much sought-after acknowledgement of crypto’s legitimacy from the White House.  The positive reaction is no surprise given that the order contains something for both true believers and persistent skeptics. For example, vocal crypto advocate Ryan Selkis, the founder of Messari, tweeted that “the devil is in the details, but … it's about as good as it gets.” Meanwhile, perhaps the industry’s fiercest critic, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), praised the order, saying that Biden is “right to spotlight crypto’s risks and we need strong rules before it’s too late.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     We agree the executive order is an important milestone. But whether it promotes its stated objective of “innovation that works for all Americans, protects our national security interests and contributes to our economic competitiveness and growth” depends on the follow through.  The order establishes an executive branch working group and commissions around 21 reports. Approximately 13 of these reports focus on enforcement, while seven deal with a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and one addresses economic competitiveness.  An accompanying fact sheet describes the order as the “first ever, whole-of-government approach to addressing the risks and harnessing the benefits of digital assets and their underlying technology.”  Particular emphasis was given to highlighting the risks of “private sector-administered digital assets,” while elevating CBDC as a method of achieving payment systems benefits with fewer concerns.  A key element of any executive order is the follow-through. As background, the previous Trump administration had issued an executive order on financial regulation that resulted in the U.S. Treasury Department’s report on “nonbank financial, fintech, and innovation.” That report promoted innovation in financial services but, infamously, excluded cryptocurrency. However, lack of subsequent direction limited the report’s impact.  The coordination process established in the Biden order, led by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and the director of the U.S. National Economic Council, Brian Deese, involves more than 15 executive agencies. In addition, at least seven financial regulators are “invited” to participate, signaling their independence as they will not be required to contribute.  Already signs are emerging that cross-governmental action will be difficult. Senior officials commonly leave after two years, which puts pressure on Deese and Sullivan (and/or their successors) to direct the agencies and set meaningful policy now. This process may be affected by the coming midterm congressional elections.  See also: Crypto Is Too Big for Partisan Politics | Opinion  White House direction could help address two significant barriers to progress: the confirmation bias problem, or the tendency to filter information in a way that reinforces existing beliefs, and the territorialism problem, whereby regulators seek to expand their jurisdiction at the expense of others.  Public engagement in the process also matters. Over 40 million Americans, (according to the White House’s executive order, likely referencing a recent NYDig survey), reportedly own cryptocurrency, and their voices ought to influence the government’s official position.  Likewise, as one of us has written, there’s no substitute for hand-on experience when developing public policy. Policymakers need to find ways to get out of the Washington bubble, develop direct knowledge of the space and meet with the people actively building and using crypto products and services.  Agency deliverables  One striking difference between the order and the accompanying fact sheet is the emphasis on a CBDC. The order’s first topic is the issuance of a CBDC, a topic which is already being studied by various governmental agencies. The report assigned to the Treasury Department on the “Future of Money” emphasizes CBDCs, including specific questions to address. Additionally, the Attorney General must opine on the legality of a CBDC and draft potential legislation.  By contrast, the fact sheet lists CBDCs last, and its discussion as part of the “Future of Money” focuses only on financial inclusion, without mentioning legal analysis or proposed legislation regarding central bank digital currencies. Additional CBDC reports in the executive order include an Office of Science and Technology Policy report on CBDC infrastructure, and a Federal Reserve report on monetary policy and payment systems.  The majority of the reports required by the order relate to enforcement. The broadest of these is likely Treasury’s report with policy recommendations “to protect United States consumers, investors and businesses, and support expanding access to safe and affordable financial services.” The most impactful may be a joint U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) report on how their existing jurisdictions may address the risks of digital assets, and whether additional authority is needed. Other reports deal with illicit activity, financial stability, climate, privacy and consumer protection as well as competition.  The order introduces new players to digital asset regulation including the Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While both agencies have commented on crypto in the past, they are now tasked with looking closer at the problems of privacy, consumer protection and competition.  It’s too early to speculate about what the CFPB might recommend in its report, but it’s notable that the consumer protection agency lacks historical expertise on “competition.” However, the agency’s current director comes from the FTC and may use the bureau’s “abusiveness” authority in an antitrust context. Notably, phrases like “disparate impact” and “unfair and deceptive practices” appear in the order.  It’s reasonable to anticipate tension between the CFPB and SEC, as the two agencies’ jurisdiction is exclusive in many respects.  Competition comes up again in the Department of Commerce’s planned report, a matter that industry innovators and leaders may welcome. The fact sheet describes this report as “Reinforcing U.S. Leadership in the Global Financial System,” or in other words, making the country competitive in the digital asset sector.  Clearly, the Biden administration fears international jurisdictions will adopt a more favorable regulatory framework for digital assets than the U.S. The order emphasizes that all countries follow the cryptocurrency dictates of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and Financial Stability Board. The White House is right to be concerned on this front, as adoption of FATF’s proposed “travel rule” has been conspicuously slow.  Many jurisdictions would love to seize the future of financial services from the United States, and it’s uncertain whether the administration has the leverage to prevent this arbitrage.  It’s notable that the Commerce Department will author the competition report, as global finance would traditionally be the Treasury Department’s domain. Treasury loosely attempts to direct financial regulators through the Financial Stability Oversight Council. By contrast, Commerce cannot claim any authority over financial regulators. So this report is unlikely to resolve key regulatory uncertainties around the SEC’s or CFTC’s domain.  Running the race  Of course, there are other notable omissions. First, there is no mention of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This is surprising, particularly given the ambiguous tax reporting provisions included within the administration’s signature legislative achievement (the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law).  Second, there is no mention of state regulators or regulation – though that’s often overlooked by federal officials.  Third, the President’s Working Group Report on Stablecoins does not appear, leading one to wonder about its status.  See also: The Urgent Need for Regulatory Clarity on Stablecoins | Opinion  Finally, there was a missed opportunity to reference the President’s Executive Order on “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” given digital assets’ potential to reduce existing market concentration in financial services.  One unnamed source close to the executive order described the much-awaited document as the starting gun of a race. If so, then innovators need to be in the race to win it. Most reports are scheduled to be issued around Labor Day, when the midterm election season heats up. In addition to engaging with agencies over the summer, innovators need to be ready for autumn hearings and a new congressional session in 2023. It’s time to lace up the running shoes and get ready.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,"Matthew Homer, Paul Watkins",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/10/executing-on-bidens-crypto-executive-order,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86b1fc0d8d898b17c9d44472be7d905e55f2398a-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Historically, stablecoins have provided dry powder for kicking off new Bitcoin rallies. USDC Exchange Inflow Sharply Rose To High Values Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, almost one billion USDC has flowed into exchanges recently. Past pattern suggests this may lead to uptrend for Bitcoin. The &apos;USD Coin exchange inflow&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of the stablecoin entering wallets of all exchanges within a given period. When the value of this indicator moves up, it means investors are depositing a higher amount of coins at the moment. Usually, holders transfer stablecoins to exchanges for converting them into a volatile crypto, like Bitcoin. They may also withdraw the coins to fiat. Investors use stablecoins like USDC when they want to exit volatile markets and hold on until prices are favorable enough for re-entering them. This implies that high stablecoin exchange inflows may show that prices are once again good for re-entry. Related Reading | Bitcoin Trading Volume Has Now Stabilized At High Values, But For How Long?

Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, 34, was indicted in a federal court in Florida on charges of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and wire fraud, intentional damage to a protected computer, and extortion. A protected computer is a computer used exclusively by either the U.S. government or a financial institution.  Vachon-Desjardins – a former IT professional for the Canadian government – was arrested in Quebec in January. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) seized 719 bitcoins (worth over $28 million at current prices) and $790,000 in Canadian currency from his home. Canadian media report, however, that Vachon-Desjardins told the court he’d actually stolen over 2,000 bitcoins over his ransomware career.  The arrest comes amid an international crackdown on ransomware. In November U.S. President Joe Biden promised to bring “the full strength of the federal government to disrupt malicious cyber activity” and, since then, several large-scale operations have brought down ransomware groups including Russia-based REvil.  Vachon-Desjardins allegedly operated as an “affiliate” of the NetWalker ransomware gang, which sells “Ransomware-as-a-Service” (RaaS) to affiliates like Vachon-Desjardins, who carry out the attack themselves, sharing a percentage of the booty with the developers.  The Toronto Sun reported that Vachon-Desjardins was also hired to teach other would-be cybercriminals how to carry out attacks effectively.  NetWalker-made ransomware was often used against hospitals, emergency services and other companies in the healthcare sector during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Vachon-Desjardins faces more than 11 years in prison if found guilty of all charges against him.

In a tweet thread on Thursday morning, FTX.US President Brett Harrison explained that FTX U.S. Derivatives’ current derivatives clearing organization license requires full collateralization of derivative positions through an intermediary. FTX’s application seeks to amend that to allow for direct-to-consumer margined derivatives trading for retail and institutional customers.  The change would allow derivatives risks to be “transparently assessed and mitigated in real time” because of FTX’s almost continuous setting of margin levels, Harrison said.  “As market-moving news over the last two weeks has demonstrated, large amounts of time between margining periods causes risk to build up in the system, resulting in market swings at next open and lack of clarity over participants’ ability to cover their capital requirements,” Harrison wrote.

42394541,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBXN1,1646932774,Is Bitcoin Legal in the United States?,"The U.S. has developed a patchwork of cryptocurrency regulations in recent years, with legislators at both the state and the federal level taking turns tackling specific areas of the industry.  Several agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also contend to oversee portions of the growing crypto market.  While these financial watchdogs have issued guidelines, warnings and rules, their efforts have been mostly uncoordinated so far.  As the digital asset market has grown into a trillion-dollar market, lawmakers have realized by now that crypto is here to stay, and there is a need for regulatory clarity. In March 2022, an executive order signed by the president directed key federal agencies to coordinate their efforts at drafting cryptocurrency regulations to protect investors and prevent illicit use without choking innovation.  While federal regulators are working on a national level framework for bitcoin, some states have come forward with their own crypto laws.  Texas and Wyoming passed crypto-friendly laws to attract businesses. The Lone Star State, which has become a bitcoin mining powerhouse after China banned crypto mining, passed the Texas Virtual Currency Act in June 2021 that defined a legal status of cryptocurrencies as a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account or store of value and let state-chartered banks offer crypto services to clients. Wyoming’s blockchain legislation, passed in 2019, approved cryptocurrencies as a legal medium of exchange and introduced a banking license system for crypto banks, such as Kraken and Avanti.  Other states opted for a tighter grasp on cryptocurrencies. New York was a pioneer to create its own framework to regulate the industry in 2015, but the infamous BitLicense added such a burden on local crypto businesses that many of them left the state.  If the patchwork of regulation confuses you, here’s the bottom line. Bitcoin is not illegal in the U.S. How you can buy it, what services and exchanges you can use and what you can use it for might depend on which state you are in, however.  Who regulates bitcoin?  Federal regulators  At the federal level, there is no singular enforcement agency that regulates bitcoin and other cryptos. The agency that has the authority to regulate a cryptocurrency is usually determined on a case-by-case basis. However, most regulatory activity for cryptocurrencies is overseen by three different organizations:  The SEC.  The CFTC.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The SEC's effort has been directed on the use of blockchain assets as securities and protecting investors, such as whether or not certain bitcoin investment vehicles should be sold to the public, and whether or not a specific offering is fraudulent. To illustrate, it depends on the agency to approve or reject any application for a bitcoin-related exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The CFTC defined bitcoin as a “commodity” and its efforts are mostly focused on monitoring the futures market of cryptocurrencies, a certain type of derivative market that allows investors to speculate on the price without actually buying the underlying commodity. The agency also assumed responsibility for investor protection and has filed lawsuits involving several bitcoin-related schemes.  Beyond the classification of a cryptocurrency, the use of the asset additionally plays a role in determining what agency is responsible for regulation.  In addition to the SEC, CFTC and the IRS, cryptocurrency may also be regulated by:  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).  The FTC is primarily responsible for protecting U.S. citizens from fraud or misrepresentations regarding cryptocurrencies.  FinCEN is the regulatory body that ensures all exchanges and crypto service providers comply with all the necessary anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing measures.  The OCC oversees the federal banking system. In 2021, the agency allowed national banks and federal savings associations to offer certain cryptocurrency-related services, such as custody, if they demonstrated they had adequate controls.  Federal regulations  While there’s a long list of federal acronyms responsible for regulating cryptocurrency, actual federal regulations are much more scarce.  Securities regulations  The SEC is the primary regulator of securities in the United States. They are responsible for regulating the issuance and sale of any cryptocurrency determined to be a security. A security is vaguely defined by the SEC as an “investment contract,” which, in turn, also needs to be defined by the SEC.  The SEC definition for an investment contract was created from the U.S. Supreme Court decision in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. in 1946. More commonly known as the “Howey Test” today, the nearly century-old analysis from the Supreme Court is now used to determine whether a cryptocurrency is considered a security.  Under the Howey Test, a cryptocurrency will be considered a security when it is:  An investment of money.  In a common enterprise.  With a reasonable expectation of profits.  Derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.  If a cryptocurrency satisfies all four requirements under the Howey Test, it will likely be considered a security under U.S. federal securities regulations. This is true regardless of whatever the asset is called or how it was created. The SEC will look to the substance of each transaction, rather than the form of the cryptocurrency.  There is an ongoing debate about what parts of the crypto industry fall under the remit of the SEC. The issue of ""substance over form"" in securities regulation was a particular focus of the SEC’s regulation of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in 2018. During this time, crypto issuers sought to avoid securities regulation by marketing their crypto as having “utility” or “voucher-like characteristics.” The SEC responded by reiterating that the form of the crypto is irrelevant to the analysis and that regulations are primarily considered with the substance of the transactions.  The SEC also has asserted to regulate decentralized finance (DeFi), a subsector of crypto that offers financial services through self-executing smart contracts, and might be the agency that ends up reining in stablecoins, privately issued cryptocurrencies with a price pegged to U.S. dollar (or other currency). The agency is also pushing for greater oversight on crypto exchanges, claiming the platforms offer tokens that might be securities.  Read more: What Is DeFi?  So, what happens if it is a security? The issuer of the cryptocurrency is required to register the security with the SEC or receive an explicit exemption from the registration requirement. If exempt, the cryptocurrency will only be available for “accredited investors.” Accredited investors are a limited group of individuals who satisfy any of the following requirements:  A director or executive officer at a company that issues securities.  An individual or married couple with a net worth of over $1 million.  An individual with a salary above $200,000 or married couple with a combined income of over $300,000 for the past two years.  Being an accredited investor is clearly not for everyone and significantly reduces the number of people who have access to a cryptocurrency. While options such as the use of Simple Agreement of Future Tokens (SAFT) have been considered as an alternative way for crypto startups to raise funds without contravening securities laws, the SEC has yet to make a decision on their validity.  Tax regulations  The IRS is the agency that enforces the rules for tax payments. Cryptocurrencies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), continue to be treated as “property” for the purposes of tax in the United States and are subject to capital gains taxes.  Read more: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  Cryptocurrency regulations  As it is likely apparent from the regulatory frameworks discussed above, the federal regulation of cryptocurrencies in the United States doesn’t apply specific cryptocurrency regulations. While this has been the unfortunate standard throughout the history of crypto in the U.S., many advocates are calling on federal regulators to change this.  The Uniform Law Commission, a nonprofit association that aims to bring clarity and cohesion to state legislation, has drafted the Uniform Regulation of Virtual Currency Business Act, which several states are contemplating introducing in upcoming legislative sessions. The legislation aims to spell out which virtual currency activities are money transmission businesses, and what type of license they would require.

42411498,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSJ2,1646932352,Profile Pic NFTs Are Suffocating Crypto Art,"Andy Warhol would have been all-in on the NFT PFP craze, seeing it as Art for Everyman and pretender to the throne of his uber-famous Campbell’s Soup can paintings. The fact the craze deigned to elevate fatuous cartoonery assembled by code into a gigantic limited edition might have made him laugh with delight. And he would have been right.  As one form of the generative art landscape that is now so popular with the NFT crowd (so-called non-fungible tokens investors), PFPs (short for “profile picture”) hit all the right buttons at exactly the right time. “Art,” after all, is just a convenient underlying asset that can inject a bit of fun into the stressful world of day trading.  This is especially fitting in our brave new world of alternative facts and truth du jour. Faceless exosuits brilliantly solved the puzzle of how to get people to throw money at a virtual Mr. Potato Head in the guise of a band of simian bad boys with nothing better to do than complain about the club management’s decision to admit females. I must admit that the Bored Ape images do have a certain appeal, but so does crack cocaine.  By 2020, NFT-land already had a reputation as a playground for fraudsters of all stripes, and many people mistakenly saw decentralization as fraudulent to its core, both because of its laughably loose criteria for what is considered to be art and because of the fuzzy concept of scarcity relative to limitlessly reproducible JPEGs. But the most damaging deceit of all was the full-on decentralization concept that art is “in the eye of the beholder” and immune to judgments that would imply the existence of qualitative differences in art. Welcome to the tyranny of Everyman as Expert.  When combined with wash trading and other nefarious means of ascribing worth to worthless images, this meant that a monetary value could be assigned to any image at all, pumped up to vast profits and gleefully traded by those who either didn’t know better or simply didn’t care. After all, few had a clue about what good art really is and they were hungry to be members of the in-crowd.  But then the apes moved in. Bored Apes with their “yacht clubs” didn’t try to compete with such pedestrian lowlife fraudsters but did a brilliantly conceived end run, applying techniques perfected and popularized by multilevel marketing schemes and master manipulators of dopamine levels such as Facebook. They used engineered scarcity and the right kinds of hype by the right kinds of people to create a tide of hysterical FOMO (fear of missing out) that grew with each new buyer and each new price on the leaderboard.  Don’t get the impression that I resent the apes’ success. While I do think it a shame that the fantastic sums paid for BAYC profile pictures could have been better spent to support serious artists, they’re welcome to their money and to their success. But I do have a problem with what they thoughtlessly did to the NFT art community as a whole. The developers clearly had no concern for art or artists, eschewing any responsibility to the community that had made their project viable in the first place.  Already a laughingstock in the eyes of serious art collectors and members of the general public, NFTs took a left jab to the chin that could end the fight. Media hype surrounding the apes and their non-simian progeny (Flitty Kitties, Beauteous Bovines or what have you) added insult to injury. An apish aroma now suffuses all blockchain-marketed digital art simply because they share the NFT tag.  Sadly, the largest viable marketplace for digital fine art must now abdicate space to pixelated flotsam bereft of artistic importance. And to the extent that public perception is molded by a continuing deluge of media hype about the latest digital Beanie Baby, great digital art has been cast into the pit.  See also: As Museums Go Dark, Crypto Art Finds Its Frame - CoinDesk  There is, however, a surprising silver lining to this story. Thanks to the publicity of art NFTs in general, more and more museums and traditional art collectors are paying attention to the medium as a legitimate and valuable new genre worthy of their interest. And some few insightful investors – even those who first became interested in NFTs via things like BAYC – have begun to look more closely at art for the first time in their lives.  Projects like BAYC have acted like potent contrast dyes injected into the corpus of art NFTs, helping to delineate the borderline between JPEG-as-underlying-asset poker chips and digital fine art. And now that the line has been drawn so clearly, it remains for the NFT community’s serious artists and the platforms providing their marketplace infrastructure to create a safe and inviting space for art lovers to show, buy, sell and trade their highly innovative digital work.  As one of those serious artists, I can hardly wait.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | TRADING,Lawrence Lee,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/10/profile-pic-nfts-are-suffocating-crypto-art,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dde924e39cd5ee153bdd1d60a72e8e52e9bbecba-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394540,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBXHt,1646932193,What Is Cloud Mining?,"Decades ago, every major software computer company would maintain basements full of computers that crunched numbers day and night. Rooms the size of gymnasiums would be devoted to the servers that keep the lights on.  That all changed in the era of cloud computing. Instead of sacrificing precious underground real estate, software companies began to rent computing power from warehouses full of powerful machines hosted elsewhere.  Cloud mining brings this same principle – outsourcing computational work – to cryptocurrency mining, the process of running powerful computers that mine for coins like bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin. Instead of buying expensive computers to mine these coins yourself, you can rent the computing power of a specialized miner from a cloud mining company based anywhere in the world.  What’s more, when you pay for cloud mining services, you’re renting part of a pool of a great deal of computational power, meaning that you’re more likely to beat other, less powerful bitcoin miners that are racing to generate a winning hash that earns them bitcoin.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  Cloud mining only applies to proof-of-work systems, like Bitcoin and the original Ethereum blockchain, which mine new cryptocurrencies with sheer computational brute force.  Cloud mining does not apply to proof-of-stake systems, which let those who lock up a number of coins within the network participate in validating new blocks and earn newly minted cryptocurrency in return. However, many staking services like Ethereum 2.0, Solana and EOS let you delegate your coins to other validators to earn a cut of the profits, which is functionally similar to cloud mining.  How to start cryptocurrency cloud mining  Getting started in cloud mining requires none of the setup that regular cryptocurrency mining does. You don’t have to buy specialized hardware, store it anywhere or pay for electricity bills.  Instead, you have to pick a successful cloud mining pool, rent some hardware from it and wait until the mining pool generates money. You also have to pick a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin, ethereum and dogecoin house the largest mining pools, according to MiningPoolStats.com.  Genesis and Bit Deer are among the largest cloud mining pools that serve retail consumers.  To get started with a cloud mining service, you need to:  Pick a cloud mining provider and a coin you wish to mine.  Sign up for an account.  Each site is slightly different; fees vary, as do the services and miners offered.  Is cloud mining profitable?  Yes, it can be. There are upfront costs – you’ll have to pay to rent these miners, and mining pools can also take a cut of your profits. It can be worthwhile, but some analysts think you might be better off just buying bitcoin instead.  Your profit will depend on the power of the miners used by the pools – newer miners will boast better specs than older models and will likely generate higher returns – and the state of the market. For instance, if you choose to hold onto your bitcoin instead of selling it for regular money, like the U.S. dollar, you’ll remain exposed to the price of bitcoin.  Different coins pose different currency risks because the market for each can fluctuate wildly. Over time, all of these small differences can compound if you rent miners with greater hash power.  Is cloud mining risky?  Cloud mining is risky insofar that you are relying on someone else to mine cryptocurrency, without ever actually checking they own the hardware necessary to mine bitcoin, or whichever coin you choose.  Lots of fraudulent cloud mining services claim to be mining bitcoin on your behalf yet just suck up your money instead. USDminer is one of many examples. They often operate completely anonymously, making it impossible to know who manages the platform, and promise extremely high rates of return over a short period of time. Other red flags include:  Spelling mistakes on the website.  Anonymous testimonials that show stock images of people’s faces.  A false company address or complete lack of one.  Sticking to well-known mining pools will greatly minimize this risk.  Read More: 4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto  As mentioned, you’re also reliant on the health of the market. Bitcoin and other mineable cryptocurrencies are highly volatile – meaning their prices can change dramatically within a short period of time. This poses a risk to your invested capital, as any coins you do earn from mining have the potential to crash in price.  There’s also a great deal of regulatory risk for cloud mining. A vast number of cloud miners used to be housed in China, for instance, since the country offered cheap electricity, and in wet seasons the industry used green energy, too. But in the spring of 2021, China cracked down on its cryptocurrency mining industry and forced miners to shut up shop or shift elsewhere. That meant anyone renting cloud miners from Chinese pools lost income.  Other countries could also ban cryptocurrency mining. The process requires huge amounts of energy, some of it from burning fossil fuels, and a handful of governments consider it a scourge on the environment.  However, it’s worth noting these risks are much lower for people who cloud mine than if you were to buy the mining machines yourself. Specialized hardware can be very expensive, not to mention the running and maintenance costs associated with mining. The hardware you bought to mine cryptocurrency might not be worth an awful lot if the demand for mining was wiped out by an economic crash.

Lagarde said the bank's digital euro task force is working hard to move the project forward, and she supports speeding up that process. She spoke during an ECB press conference on Thursday, referring to the ECB's two-year investigation into a digital euro that started in October 2021.  “I think we have to be a little bit ahead of the curve if we can on that front. So I hope we can accelerate the work.

42420990,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAqeT,1646929574,Crypto Firms May Look at Traditional Finance Firms as M&A Targets,"If some observers are right, cryptocurrency mergers and acquisitions may soon become a “man bites dog” story.  Or, if you will, an ""AOL Buys Time Warner"" story.  This much is clear: Deal activity in the crypto sector is heating up. As mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies grows, so has the number of mergers and acquisitions in the digital assets market. New deals or partnerships that blur the lines between traditional finance and crypto finance are announced daily. The total value of crypto-related M&A rose to $55 billion in 2021 from $1.1 billion a year earlier, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Some cash-rich crypto companies have also begun to acquire traditional finance assets. In January, crypto exchange Coinbase bought FairX, a U.S.-based derivatives platform. In Europe, cryptocurrency trading and payments firm BCB Group said it would buy Sutor Bank, a 100-year-old German bank.  Public blockchain networks, which were once an anathema to traditional financial institutions, are now an acceptable topic of conversation on Wall Street. According to analysts at Bank of America, the Solana blockchain could become the ""Visa of the digital asset ecosystem.""  In such a market, it doesn’t seem crazy to wonder if Visa itself, or another storied incumbent, could look to acquire or build influence over blockchains such as Solana to try to ward off a competitive threat from this new technology. In fact, Visa has been dipping its toes into the crypto ocean in areas such as stablecoins, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and startup incubation.  CoinDesk spoke to several industry figures and asked them whether traditional finance companies could look to invest, buy a stake in or even start buying up coins to try to influence or control blockchain-based protocols. We asked them what are the barriers for financial institutions to buy coins or a stake in a network and whether traditional finance could try to absorb crypto finance in order to survive.  Surprisingly, some of them predicted the opposite: that crypto companies flush with cash might make more deals for traditional players, and acquisitions like BCB’s would no longer seem unusual. Wild as it may sound, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, CEO of leading crypto exchange Binance, recently said he’s eyeing non-crypto acquisitions in order to “make the crypto industry bigger.”  As referred to above, there is precedent for such table-turning acquisitions from the dotcom era two decades ago, when early internet on-ramp AOL took over media dinosaur Time Warner (although the fate of the combined company might serve as a cautionary tale for would-be crypto empire builders).  Here’s what the experts said:  Hany Rashwan  Co-founder and CEO of crypto ETP issuer 21Shares  Judging by history, I would predict that M&A will go the other direction. Crypto companies are cash-rich fast movers that are building a fundamentally 10 times better product than traditional finance. We are looking at a lot of traditional finance assets that look very cheap right now.  Legacy incumbents with a poor track record on innovation typically have an inability to monetize, retain and grow innovative fast-moving startups. Internet history is littered with examples of these incompatibilities in a lot of different styles, from AOL's $164 billion ""merger of equals"" with Time Warner in 2001 to Yahoo's value-destroying acquisition by yet another legacy media company, Verizon, in 2017.  It is hard to see a slow-moving incumbent that lacks innovation and technology culture to somehow both acquire and expand a cutting-edge crypto startup company.  While there are no disclosure rules in crypto, it will be difficult for an outside party to come into these ecosystems and ""control"" without the implicit buy-in from the specific community that is underpinning the protocol, DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) or foundation targeted. When the community can just pick up, copy the project (fork) and leave, community buy-in and support will be so much more important than how a normal hostile takeover happens in the traditional world.  It'll be quite difficult for these traditional companies to stage a hostile takeover of a top crypto community without creating an ugly backlash and exodus from the community. In many cases, it would be as silly as some company in 1996 trying to take over and control the internet. Traditional players can and should build applications on top of these technologies and protocols. We have already seen top banks experiment with settlement and clearing on blockchains, and I would expect to see more experimentation from these players in the future.  Paul McCaffery  Head of alternative capital sales/co-head of equities at U.S. investment bank Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW)  I do think you might see an increase in crypto firms acquiring banks for their charters and funding as the crypto balance sheet and earnings profile matures. However, I think that even after [Wednesday’s] presidential executive order, we need actual regulatory clarity for this to really pick up any steam.  Right now, many crypto firms are making a lot of money and just funneling it all into customer acquisition, but that isn’t going to last. Fees will compress as incumbents get more involved in the crypto space, and when profitability expectations increase, these firms will have to make more money on their lending/deposit-oriented activities.  Separately, I can see a scenario, though, where we get some regulatory clarity around digital assets at some point, and if stablecoin issuance has to go through federally insured deposit institutions such as the [President’s Working Group] report suggested in November, bank charters could become additive to certain crypto platforms (i.e. think like a Circle or Gemini, anyone who issues a coin).  For now, the hurdles [for traditional players looking at crypto] remain lack of regulatory clarity, onerous capital requirements (i.e. banks as relates to 100%+ risk weightings) and ill-suited GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) intangible asset accounting rules. Clarity on these items will also be required to see real appetite for the traditionals.  I also think the public market traditional finance group is currently constrained by the loftier private market valuations at this point. However, I would imagine you will see increasing participation from bank and payment companies in blockchain networks, like Tassat and USDF. There are already hundreds of banks that have expressed interest in Tassat and USDF.  James Stickland  CEO of institutional crypto trading platform Elwood Technologies  Traditional finance is already investigating the crypto markets, as evidenced by Visa buying a CryptoPunk and Mastercard supporting on-ramps for Coinbase's NFT platform.  These two events would have been unimaginable even two years ago.  Further, these worlds are already colliding. For example, Coinbase, a publicly listed crypto company, bought BRD wallet, merging a decentralized wallet with their centralized one.  Ultimately, we will see further mergers between traditional and digital-native companies, but I think it's unlikely to be in the form of buying tokens instead, forming long-standing partnerships. This trend will only continue as we see more institutions entering the digital asset market.  Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie  Founder and CEO of crypto trading and payments services firm BCB Group  Traditional finance simply can’t ignore the speed and efficiency that blockchain is bringing to payments. The improvements that this technology has made on the speed and costs of remittances is disrupting the market and payment companies, and banks have a number of options to adapt to this new reality. We are seeing the crucial role of partnerships throughout the industry, but we have yet to see if traditional players will maintain their position with current strategies to increase their leverage on these faster, cheaper networks.  This raises questions on how much control could traditional finance expect to achieve beyond internal blockchain innovation and M&A, leaving options such as acquiring enough coins on a blockchain to influence its future development. The decentralized structure of blockchain is designed to push back any centralized control, though this will be continually tested by the technological and financial firepower of leading stakeholders and from those with the most to lose and gain.  So far, we have seen incredible resilience in maintaining the integrity of decentralized networks and traditional finance will continue to enable centralized finance to access the crypto markets. We are starting to see a hybrid approach where the parallel systems of CeFi (centralized finance) and DeFi (decentralized finance) can work harmoniously together while taking on the best each has to offer.  TradFi (traditional finance) may want to eat DeFi, but its eyes may be bigger than its stomach.  Thomas B. Michaud  President and CEO of KBW  The collision between blockchain and payments is gaining traction (witness the growing collaboration that has been announced).  The current payment system was essentially developed in the 1970's. It is time for modernization, and blockchain offers a contemporary alternative to how payments are made, especially in a B2B context.  Regulation is coming. The gap between innovation and regulation is about as wide as I have ever seen it. Expect the gap to narrow with the government stepping up to provide guardrails and guidance to the industry.  More likely than M&A activity, I believe the near future is going to be driven by joint ventures and collaboration. Fintechs and traditional financial institutions have a great deal to offer each other, but a JV reduces risk and allows for substantial upside for both parties.  JVs also allow for the usage to expand faster as more financial institutions are able to offer the product and services.  Elie Bonin  Head of digital assets trading at market maker GHCO  I believe we are in the wake of a silent revolution. Bit by bit, renowned companies get exposure to crypto, be it by owning coins or by accepting tokens as a means of payment.  Crypto is not only about money and cheap transactions, it is also about decentralized consensus and infrastructure maintenance; it is a formidable opportunity for companies to reduce operational costs. As robots replaced men, blockchain will replace companies' computers and databases. They will simply need to operate logic on top of these.  In these times of meek economic growth, my take is that governments perceive this as a potential pool of growth and innovation, which leads to favorable regulations here and there.  With this in mind, should you be a private company, you truly only have three choices: to ignore the whole crypto topic and endure the opportunity cost; to partake in its evolution by eventually becoming what we call a chain validator, reaping transaction fees as an additional source of revenue; or to convert themselves by building products directly on the blockchain  Having said that, should we take the example of Visa and Mastercard, their profit margins are respectively 51% and 46%. There is no rush for them to [make] a pro-crypto transformation. For the likes of the banks, because of the immense regulatory hurdles, I frankly doubt we see serious involvement from them any time soon. Simply getting crypto profits from an exchange to a bank account gives them cold feet.  Being involved in a blockchain as such does not necessarily give you control over it. As Vitalik [Buterin, one of the co-founders of the Ethereum blockchain] said in a paper, the goal of crypto economics is to avoid this new technology encountering the usual human governance and decision-making issues.  In the case of Ethereum and Bitcoin, upgrades are subject to a rough consensus that involves all the vested interests. Owning a substantial part of the coins will not grant you additional decisional power. A private company that would like to delve and get actively involved into crypto should keep this in mind: They agree to delegate to the community the power to decide on certain topics.  The likes of Visa and Mastercard could achieve inorganic growth through crypto, tapping into new markets, but without the certainty to achieve control over it, no matter the amount invested.  Frank Schuil  CEO and co-founder of crypto exchange Safello  It's clear that traditional financial players will acquire their way into a market if needs be. We can look at the acquisitions of Tink by Visa and Aia by Mastercard to see a real-life example of the companies' ability to adapt to change, in this case open banking.  Influence over decentralized protocols is much harder to do, and it's a losing game. Influence over one protocol leads to copycats; we have seen that numerous times in our industry. And efforts to build centralized solutions to compete with decentralized solutions have proven to be futile time and time again, as well.  Instead the companies' leading the payment space today will adapt to the technology through make-or-buy decisions and/or lobby to outlaw their competition. We see similar efforts underway in the United States, where legislation is proposed by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) to curtail the DeFi market.  The size and maturity of the crypto industry makes it unlikely that TradFi will eat the entire industry. There will be those financial institutions that adapt and those who won't. The analogy here is closer to how the internet impacted TradFi than for instance PSDII/open banking. There are 6,008 banks in Europe alone, how many of them have the competencies, appetite and go-to-market timeline luxury to do this themselves? How many will hold out while customer demand gets stronger both on the retail and corporate side? It's likely going to be a frenzy once MiCA regulation comes into effect to power TradFi offerings with crypto capabilities. (MiCA, or Markets in Crypto Assets. is the European Commission's proposed set of regulations.) We will gladly help them, it's a foundational principle of our company.  Compliance is the biggest thing holding adoption back. In Europe, this will change with MiCA. Until then, TradFi will need to keep it off balance sheet and partner up or sit on the sidelines.

42395821,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzYR1,1646928975,This Tiny Blockchain Startup’s Tangle With SEC Could End Up as Landmark Case,"It’s a blockchain startup project that few people have heard of, involving a cryptocurrency that barely anyone trades.  But the saga of LBRY is being closely tracked by lawyers who say the low-profile case now before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could have massive implications for the key question of which cryptocurrencies might be deemed to be afoul of regulations and why.  The SEC’s civil lawsuit against LBRY might end up setting a regulatory precedent for hundreds of small-scale crypto projects, security lawyers interviewed by CoinDesk said. That’s true, even though LBRY’s token, LBC, has a market capitalization of just $21 million – a tiny fraction of XRP, the $39 billion cryptocurrency at the heart of the much higher profile case by the SEC against Ripple Labs.  “A judicial opinion in the LBRY case will have much more impact for people looking for clarity than the Ripple case,” said Grant Gulovsen, a third-party lawyer who advises crypto startups and who's not involved in the LBRY litigation. “There are so many, many projects that did similar things to what LBRY did compared to what Ripple did,” he said.  A suit from last March  LBRY is a blockchain-based file-sharing and payment network designed to create a publication platform that allows uncensored and unlimited digital content interaction. Financial transactions like tipping and subscription of paid content can be made on the platform through LBC, its token currency. The platform’s owner is based in Manchester, N.H.  The SEC sued LBRY last March for allegedly offering unregistered securities to raise a total of $6.2 million starting in 2016. The SEC accused LBRY of offering and selling LBC to institutional investors and using the proceeds to pay bills for operating expenses. Investments where returns are closely intertwined with a business’ managing performance are typically considered securities, regulated assets that need to be registered with the SEC.  Unlike bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies that are more decentralized, LBC is managed by a centralized team. That is why the SEC thinks LBC should be considered a security instead of a currency. Many crypto-related regulatory disputes surround debates over the definition of securities.  LBRY also made an ambitious promise about the token’s future value that the SEC thought to be misleading. LBRY updated some changes on its platform in February 2021 and said on its website that “best is yet to come” with a rocket ship emoji the SEC thought was hinting at the potential growth of LBC.  LBC holders’ return is based purely on the potential value of the token. They don’t receive interest, dividends or governing rights.  LBRY responded to the SEC in June, writing in a court filing that “LBRY’s sales of LBC do not resemble securities in any meaningful way.”  The company even went so far as to compare the SEC’s pursuit of the case to the relentless persistence of the French inspector Javert in “Les Miserables.”  The SEC is “squeezing a new technology into an outdated and vague definition of ‘security,’” the project’s filing said.  “The Supreme Court’s ‘investment contract’ test for the definition of a ‘security’ does not extend to situations where, like here, one ‘purchases a commodity for personal consumption,’” LBRY wrote.  The SEC Policy  “Oftentimes, it’s just luck,” said Lisa Bragança, a former SEC enforcement lawyer who now acts as defense attorney for crypto startups. The Chicago-based lawyer is not involved in the LBRY case.  “The SEC doesn’t really care about what the formal fundraising process is. They look at the substance of what they did,” she said.  Ripple was sued in December 2020 for allegedly raising over $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering. The case is one of the biggest crypto lawsuits before the SEC and has attracted much media coverage because of the popularity of the digital asset, XRP, which is used in Ripple’s payment network. The case is also in the discovery phase at the moment.  It’s common practice for firms under the SEC’s microscope to settle allegations without going to trial, which is partly why LBRY’s case, along with Ripple’s, is so rare – offering a courtroom test of the law and regulators’ interpretation of what constitutes a security.  Initial coin offerings, similar to initial public offering in traditional stock markets, are used by many crypto projects to raise funds. The process bears hallmarks of securities offerings that merit enforcement actions.  LBRY, however, didn’t have an ICO. The project claimed that LBCs were issued just to platform users for utility purposes only. The token was meant to be fully functional and decentralized since its launch.  Gulovsen said he was surprised that the SEC even filed this case in the first place.  ICOs represented “the controversial way of fund sourcing behind most wrongdoings sought after by the SEC,” he said.  Saving crypto?  What the SEC is targeting in this case is how LBRY publicly announced to its community (investors in the crypto world) that it planned to engage with a “market maker.” A market maker is an entity that is supposed to buy and sell the company’s crypto token on a regular basis at prevailing market prices. Such an announcement is likely to increase the price of their token, striking a nerve with the SEC.  “Compared to everything that’s happening in the crypto space, LBRY belongs to those who try very hard to do the right things,” Gulovsen said.  “If LBC is a security, every other cryptocurrency is a security,” LBRY CEO Jeremy Kauffman told CoinDesk. “We are not trying to compete with the existing financial system. LBC is used for its intended purpose, not for speculative reasons.”  Keith Miller of Perkins Coie, LBRY’s defense attorney, said, “LBRY intends to vigorously defend this action. They stand by their answer to the SEC’s complaint and do not believe that LBCs are securities.”  As the case heats up, the project’s officials have cast themselves as unlikely heroes.  “HELP US SAVE CRYPTO,” LBRY called out to supporters in a pinned tweet, featuring an image with LBRY as David and the SEC as Goliath.  The SEC declined to provide a comment for this story.  The SEC’s recent move  Last month, the SEC filed a motion for an extension of the trial’s discovery phase, arguing that LBRY hadn’t produced certain documents.  The judge granted the motion in part, extending the discovery period by 30 days, but declined to move the trial start date beyond Sept. 30.  LBRY expressed frustration in a tweet: “At last minute, the SEC wants to pause our court case for another eight weeks to collect more ‘evidence.’”  “It is unusual for the plaintiffs to ask for additional time,” Bragança said. “That was a surprise. Either the SEC lawyers are running into problems at how to pursue the case, or this is a result of internal politics as they wait for the Ripple case to become the predecessor.”  Before the suit kicked off early last year, LBRY had already been under SEC investigation for three years. The LBRY team claims to have complied with the SEC in supplying nearly 1 million pages of documents along with multiple in-person testimonies. Those documents and interviews, according to the company, cost “substantial amounts of time, energy and money” that caused “significant harm” to the small business.  “Even as LBRY cooperated with the investigation and complied with subpoenas, the SEC […] threatened to seek even more voluminous materials through administrative subpoenas in order to bankrupt the company,” the company wrote in its answer to the SEC’s complaint.  Win or lose, LBRY is likely to set an example for peers. No similar case has reached a verdict so far.  Gulovsen said he is surprised that the SEC is still collecting evidence at this stage of the proceedings.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Angelique Chen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/10/this-tiny-blockchain-startups-tangle-with-sec-could-end-up-as-landmark-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e860afee81066a5c9d2e9d315f54862816d3279b-843x632.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395823,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzYO4,1646926720,Biden’s Executive Order Calls for ‘Highest Urgency’ on CBDC Research and Development,"U.S. President Joe Biden called for an urgent, government-wide focus to be placed on the research and development of a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) in his executive order signed Wednesday.  The order calls for a full-scale assessment of the potential benefits and risks of a CBDC, both for consumers and investors as well as the broader U.S. financial system. Biden has ordered the Treasury Department to spearhead the research and report, with input from other federal agencies, including the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Homeland Security.  The assessment is also supposed to determine whether the implementation of a CBDC would be in “the national interest.”  There are several organizations already researching and piloting CBDCs in the United States, including the Boston Fed, which has partnered with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on CBDC technology, and the Digital Dollar Project, a public-private partnership founded by consulting firm Accenture and Chris Giancarlo, the former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  However, U.S. efforts have moved noticeably slower than those in other countries, including China, whose digital yuan is already being piloted in cities across the country. The order suggests that Biden – who noted that “over 100 countries are exploring or piloting” CBDCs – does not want the U.S. to get left behind.  David Treat, global blockchain lead at Accenture, told CoinDesk that the government will need to work with industry leaders if it wants to get things done right – and quickly.  “The executive order catalyzes the important work to pilot, test and advance the development of a CBDC,” Treat said. “We are excited about the pilot programs that the Digital Dollar Project will launch with our multi-stakeholder community.”  The Digital Dollar Project has promised five pilot projects, which are planned to kick off in the coming months, to evaluate whether and how a U.S. CBDC would benefit people who are unbanked (or underbanked) – a key point stressed in Biden’s executive order.  But though Biden’s attempt to speed up CBDC research and development might make things faster, it is unlikely to make things fast.  “The work to build private-public partnership for digital asset experimentation takes time,” Jennifer Lassiter, executive director of the Digital Dollar Project, told CoinDesk.

The Consumer Price Index rose 7.9% over the past 12 months, the fastest since 1982, the U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday. On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.8% in February, faster than the 0.6% increase reported for January.  So-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.5% in February, slower than analysts' expectations. The core inflation rate was driven by increases in shelter prices as well as for recreation, household furnishings and airline fares.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, held steady at $39,300 five minutes after the report was released. Some traders view bitcoin as a hedge against inflation given its limited supply.  ""Bitcoin declined after both a sixth consecutive hot inflation report and hopes collapsed for an immediate diplomatic resolution between Ukraine and Russia,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. ""Bitcoin remains locked into the risk trade and will continue to trade off incremental updates from Ukraine.""  Gasoline prices rose 6.6% in February, accounting for a third of the monthly increase in the overall price index, the bureau said. Analysts say rising oil prices will push inflation higher and thus push bitcoin higher.

42411508,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSZZ,1646921896,What Web 3 Can Learn From Steve Jobs,"Legendary technologist and Apple (AAPL) CEO Steve Jobs may have been better with words than he was with design. He recognized that “every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.” From the printing press to the telegram to the iPhone – these products not only changed entire industries, they changed the world and the way we interact with it.  When Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007, he emphasized its innovative user interface that replaced the typical smartphone keyboard with a wide, multi-touch screen. As he predicted, this breakthrough product decision created a new standard for consumer hardware and led to competitive innovations. There likely would be no Snapchat or WhatsApp without the iPhone.  Today, enthusiasts hope that Web 3 changes everything. Its differentiating technology, smart contracts made up of immutable code and data on the blockchain, aims to cut out the need for middlemen in finance to help creators retain ownership and more. Similar to the iPhone’s trajectory, enthusiasts posit that smart contracts innovation will create new and improved industries and behaviors.  However, products built using smart contracts are more analogous to early smartphones than the iPhone. They are miles away from decentralization, aggressively technical and composed of discordant user interfaces.  First, you have to research and choose the right wallet for the blockchain(s) you intend to use.  Second, you must write down your 12- to 24-word seed phrase (password) and keep it somewhere safe and never lose it. Then you must on-ramp fiat currency into cryptocurrency – mind the regulatory gaps, depending on your domicile.  See also: Brainwallets: The Bitcoin Wallet You Probably Shouldn't Use  You may or may not succeed. If you don’t give up you have to learn about gas fees, swaps, slippage, bridges and other concepts to buy or trade tokens. The reality is that people are accustomed to beautifully designed, frictionless products. Most will give up.  Simply put, Web 3 products today are not so smart and hard to use. There will be no widespread adoption until builders rethink everything and create with consumers in mind.  This is where I expect enthusiasts to point out upcoming technical updates that will make Web 3 cheaper and simpler. I’m optimistic, but those updates remain in progress. In the meantime, builders should rethink three key things: language, custody and utility.  Rethink language: The crypto-to-Web 3 rebrand did wonders for how we talk about Ethereum innovation. However, the language that builders use remains inaccessible to most people. What exactly do we mean by composable? Permissionless? Trustless? These terms sound more complex than they are. One of my favorite crypto wallets, a considerably consumer-friendly one, labels Polygon as a “sidechain with its own consensus mechanisms.” This means nothing to the everyday person without a deep knowledge of Ethereum networks. In fact, that language can be considered hostile and inscrutable. We need to change the way we talk about Web 3 products and technology, lest we discourage curious newcomers.  Rethink custody: 75% of respondents in a 2019 Google study expressed frustration in keeping track of their passwords, which tend to be basic. How does Web 3 expect people to secure and remember 12 or more random words that make up seed phrases? In the short term, builders should explore creative, custodial solutions that accomodate and incrementally change consumer behaviors. For example, an internet leisure organization called Poolsuite launched membership non-fungible tokens (NFT) last year with a key benefit: mobile wallet integration. iPhone users can add their Poolsuite NFT to their Apple Wallet and use the app to unlock future experiences. This approach shows how Web 3 can meet people where they are today while working toward a decentralized future.  Rethink utility: Several Web 3 protocols and products introduced in the last few months mimic existing platforms and features. Why? We don’t really need another Twitter, skeuomorphic wallet, or Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT derivative. Instead, builders should leverage novel technologies at their disposal to create new experiences for consumers. We’ve just begun to scratch the surface of generative artificial intelligence (AI) NFTs for storytelling and identity, the bridge between online and physical goods, and tokenized economies. How these ideas manifest will depend on builders pushing the limit of what’s possible with both software and hardware.  One could argue that friction is good for innovation.

The Sustainable Impact Fund aims to invest in Hedera-based solutions that involve carbon emissions, offsets and removals, as well as other nature-based projects, the foundation said in a release.  DOVU, a Hedera-powered “trust layer” for carbon offset integrity, will be the first project to receive a grant from the fund. The funding amount was not disclosed.  DOVU provides granular tracking of carbon offset credits so that buyers have confidence in the origin and source of the credits. Carbon offset credits refers to a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The credits are used for land restoration or tree planting to compensate for emissions elsewhere.  Hedera’s universe of decentralized apps is largely based on enterprise usage. The blockchain protocol launched in September 2019 after an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018. The HBAR Foundation was started last year and was allocated $2.5 billion in HBAR tokens by Hedera’s governing body.  Hedera is a distributed ledger of transactions using a new consensus algorithm known as hashgraph to process more transactions at scale than proof-of-work and proof-of-stake networks.

42411502,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSSx,1646920200,What’s a ‘Long-Term’ Time Horizon for Crypto?,"Most investors have an idea of how long they plan to hold something before buying or selling any type of asset.  Whether it’s a target date fund or simply a medium-term investment vehicle started for, say, a down payment on a home, there’s been enough precedent for the majority of asset classes that retail investors can normally plan how long their cash will be tied up.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.  Crypto, however, is different. With just a little more than a decade of data – and that’s for bitcoin, not the 16,000+ altcoins in circulation – it’s still becoming clear who’s in it for the long haul, who sees it as a cash grab, and who’s investing strictly for the fear of missing out (FOMO).  Regardless, it’s important to have a sound investment thesis explaining the “why” behind your crypto investments. That helps you determine how long to hold and discern whether you’re a trader or more of a subscriber to the “HODL” philosophy – meaning “hold on for dear life” and describing a long-term approach to crypto investing.  It turns out, the answer to that question depends on what crypto appeals to you. “The crypto and blockchain space is still in its early stage,” said Armando Aguilar, an independent crypto analyst and former digital asset strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “Holding periods depend on the investors.”  Different investors, different strategies  Crypto diehards and purists who believe blockchain and digital currencies are the future are probably planning to hold their crypto for many years to come. These investors should choose to buy tokens representing high-quality applications, protocols and ecosystems with strong communities backing them, according to Aguilar. All the signals for liquidity should be there, looking at market cap and trading volume. Plus, the asset should have evidence that signals high implementation and adoption, along with the ability to withstand volatility.  Meanwhile, speculators and short-term traders may hold crypto for more sporadic periods of time. “Holding periods can vary from hours, to days, to less than a few months,” Aguilar said. “Long term can be seen as anywhere between five and 10 years, if we are to compare it to the internet adoption curve over time.”  Shorter, medium and longer term  Short-term strategies parallel those of the stock market and include day trading, arbitrage and other moves meant to facilitate quick reselling and profits. Using popular crypto exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and others, investors can buy, sell and trade as many times as they want from day to day.  However, a strategy of six to 24 months requires that investors consider factors such as planned network upgrades, partnerships, roadmaps and project developments that could potentially materialize and as a result see positive price momentum. “These strategies are based on short to medium-term analyses where adoption, integration and business scalability have a major role in the investment analysis for investors,” Aguilar said.  Finally, strategies that take three or more years to enact are often performed by people who stay abreast of crypto news, or even have a foot within the industry. This may include venture capitalists, family offices, and other long-term investors who have access to early stage deals at lower valuations, but are locked in their investments for longer periods of time, according to Aguilar.  While an investor is “HODLing,” they may also make other decentralized finance (DeFi) moves, such as lending and staking, which may allow them to earn interest on their crypto. In these scenarios, they may allow their crypto to be locked up in the ecosystem and used to validate transactions, in exchange for passive income via interest. In addition, there’s always the possibility that their crypto assets will appreciate in value, leading to a longer-term gain.  Moving forward  As an advisor, your role is to help your clients determine their “why” behind their crypto investment thesis, which will lead them to a conclusion about time horizon. Many financial advisors agree that blockchain technology could be a viable long-term investment, but there are dozens of ways to invest in it that appeal to a broad spectrum of investors (from passive to more aggressive).  “Blockchain technology is what powers cryptocurrencies,” said Washington, D.C.-based certified financial planner Marguerita Cheng. “One way of benefiting from cryptocurrency without taking on as much risk is to invest in the underlying technology, digital payments or fintech. That’s a way in which you don’t have to deal with FOMO. Maybe you’re not going to get as much upside, but you’re still going to benefit from that exposure.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/10/whats-a-long-term-time-horizon-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a575aa1a3b96430a35ee5f552f6229d533e091ed-2880x1593.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411501,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSPe,1646920200,Why Decentralized Exchanges Are Important in the Crypto Economy,"Back in 2012, as an excited economics undergrad, I decided I wanted to invest some of the money I had into bitcoin (BTC). It was a complicated process that involved driving to Walmart (WMT) and sending a MoneyGram money order to a company called ZipZap, which would then send my money to a company called BitInstant. After a few weeks, BitInstant would deposit my bitcoin into my wallet on the Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. The entire process took over three weeks, and I always wondered how this innovative digital currency would ever replace its competition if this was the process.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.  Shortly after my first bitcoin experience, centralized companies such as Coinbase (COIN), QuadrigaCX and Bitstamp appeared on the scene. These companies had bank accounts, which meant they were essentially plugged into the modern financial system and made it significantly easier to purchase cryptocurrencies.  These centralized crypto exchanges seemed to work perfectly – until they didn’t. Mt. Gox was attacked in 2014 and over 850,000 bitcoins were stolen. Bitstamp was hacked in 2015, BTC-e was shut down in 2017 and the infamous QuadrigaCX was hacked – by its owner and CEO – in 2018 and eventually shut down, having lost all its clients’ coins, in 2019.  Not all centralized exchanges have had issues. There are many currently operating that have had years of successful business operations and many happy customers. Centralized exchanges have their own negatives, however. They’re forced to obey know-your-consumer (KYC) regulations of the country in which they reside, they have limits in terms of order book size and they require the user to trust the solvency of the business, something often seen as a negative by native crypto users.  A combination of these issues, along with the development of smart contracts, eventually led to an elegant solution: an exchange platform built entirely on crypto, in a completely trustless and decentralized manner – a decentralized exchange. For the second part of this series on decentralized finance (DeFi), we’ll explore why decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, are so important in the crypto economy.  Read the first part of this series on understanding DeFi.  What are the benefits of DEXs?  DEXs are very complex smart contracts but they have simple goals: to provide liquidity to anyone who wishes to trade cryptocurrencies. The most popular DEX is Uniswap, which is built entirely on the Ethereum blockchain. Uniswap provides a decentralized trading platform for any crypto user who wishes to trade Ethereum-based tokens.  DEXs have a few significant benefits over centralized exchanges. They do not require KYC and they operate 24/7. They also provide investors with yield farming opportunities, which are opportunities to help facilitate decentralized swapping – or trading – of digital assets in exchange for a small fee. And the smart contract code (Uniswap is written in Solidity) is open and transparent, allowing crypto natives to simply verify the code instead of trusting a centralized business to be solvent.  DEXs do, however, have some drawbacks. Transactions are irrevocable, they only allow you to trade a single chain’s asset – Uniswap is only on Ethereum, for example – and there’s rug pull risk and impermanent risk (topics we’ll discuss in greater detail in the next article in this series).  So how do these DEXs work?  Unlike centralized exchanges (in both crypto and traditional finance, or TradFi) that use order books, a system that has worked well for over two centuries, DEXs use two innovations to provide services to their users: liquidity pools and automated market maker services.  Essentially, DEXs provide liquidity – pools of paired assets – that traders can use to swap one token for another. Liquidity pools are smart contracts that traders utilize to move in and out of certain tokens based upon their goals. Automated market maker services are complex smart contracts within the liquidity pool smart contracts that control the price of certain crypto trading pairs in liquidity pools and increase or decrease price based on supply and demand in the market.  The smart contract that governs liquidity pools relies on a specific formula for determining the price of each token. The formula is X * Y = k. X and Y are represented by tokens, and k represents the constant. This formula essentially governs the liquidity pool. (We’ll do a deep dive into liquidity pools and automated market maker systems in my next article.)  Not only do liquidity pools offer traders access to decentralized liquidity, they also offer investment opportunities to those wishing to stake assets in the liquidity pool. When a user swaps assets through a liquidity pool, a very small fee is paid to the individuals who are providing the liquidity. To put this in common TradFi terms, those who contribute capital to the liquidity pools essentially earn a fee similar to that of a market maker. Liquidity pools, especially new ones, offer very high yields to investors. This concept is called yield farming, and provides income opportunities for those who understand the concept.  In Q4 2021, for instance, Uniswap processed $238.4 billion worth of trades, an increase of 61% from Q3. A total of $681.1 billion was traded through Uniswap liquidity pools in 2021.  Takeaways  The main takeaway is that DEXs provide all the same services as centralized exchanges, yet they do it in an anonymous and trustless manner. Technology now allows for this to exist outside of any regulated industry and increases access to these financial services for everyone.  Prior to the creation of Ethereum, traders were forced to use a centralized system to exchange and trade any asset. Smart contracts have opened the doors to a trustless and completely open financial system that, if used correctly, has the chance to bring economic benefits to all participants.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING | UNI,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/10/why-decentralized-exchanges-are-important-in-the-crypto-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36581c41abd755c8ffa84d1b54058821ca44d404-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395849,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzYbq,1646918171,"First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Awaits Triangle Breakout, Focus on Dollar","Good morning, and welcome to First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin drops as Ukraine-Russia talks break down.  Featured stories: Bitcoin awaits triangle breakout. Traders need to keep a close eye on the dollar's monthly chart.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today’s show will feature guests:  Chris Matta, president, 3iQ Digital Assets.  Patrick Sells, chief innovation officer, NYDIG.  Tom Novak, chief digital officer, Visions Federal Credit Union.  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin fell to $39,000 during overnight trading hours as global market euphoria cooled after negotiations between Ukraine and Russia broke down in merely two hours, signaling a long road ahead to peace.  Late Wednesday, the U.S. House passed legislation banning imports of Russian oil and other energy products in a bid to impose stricter punitive sanctions on Moscow for invading Ukraine. Oil and other commodities have been on a tear ever since the conflict started and threaten to send a new wave of inflation worldwide.  The top cryptocurrency's options market saw bullish flows, with buying outright call options and purchasing call spreads being the most popular trades. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.  ""At present, the short-term bullish sentiment appears relatively strong,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto-asset management company Blofin, said while commenting on flows.  ""Ahead of the quarterly delivery, the only uncertainty is from the European Central Bank. Other things like Fed rate hikes are effectively already priced in,"" Ardern added.  Most alternative cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin lower, with privacy coins taking a bigger hit than coins associated with smart contract blockchains, decentralized finance protocols and gaming tokens.  THORChain's RUNE token surged 37%, topping $5.50 after the cross-chain protocol listed synthetic assets on its platform. Synthetic assets are tokenized derivatives representing traditional assets like stocks or bonds  The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against majors, traded steady above 98.00, having tanked 1% on Wednesday.  Traders eyed the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data due at 13:30 UTC, which is expected to show the cost of living rose at an annualized 7.8% in February following January's 7.5% increase.  The European Central Bank (ECB) left key policy tools unchanged, as expected. ECB's President Christine Lagarde will hold a news conference at 13:30 UTC.  Read: Inflation, Tracked by Bitcoiners, Keeps Accelerating, and It Hasn't Even Peaked  Latest Headlines  ICON’s ICX Rockets 70% as Crypto-Friendly Candidate Wins South Korean Presidential Election  Elrond Network Acquires Payments Firm Twispay, Wins E-Money License  Bitcoin Reverses Wednesday's Gain Ahead of ECB Rate Decision, US CPI  Fantom-Based Algo Protocol Fantasm Exploited for $2.6M  THORChain’s RUNE Surges 37% After DeFi Synthetic Assets Goes Live  FTX Hires Former WB Gaming Exec to Lead Gaming Partnerships  GameFi Is a New Game for Southeast Asia Players  JustCarbon, Likvidi Launch Blockchain Markets for Carbon Credits  Bitcoin's Triangular Consolidation  By Omkar Godbole  While bitcoin reversed Wednesday's spike, it remained trapped in a triangle pattern marked by Jan. 24 and Feb. 24 lows and Feb. 10 and March 2 highs.  ""The news has gotten better for bitcoin lately, but technically speaking, there is not much to say until we see a breakout from these triangles,"" Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity, tweeted.  A potential decline below the lower line of the trend line would imply a continuation of the broader drop from record highs. On the downside, support is seen at $30,000, below which the next technical price floor is seen directly at the December 2017 high of $19,891.  A rise above the upper trend line, if any, may see chart analysts call a bullish revival.  Whether bitcoin will break higher or lower from the triangle is anybody's guess. That said, the impending U.S. inflation figures might inject volatility into the market. A big beat on expectations may bring selling pressure to bitcoin, as discussed here.  ""In my opinion, investors have not fully priced in the possibility of an early shrink of the [Fed] balance sheet (say, starting in April),"" Blofin's Ardern said. ""That could happen if the CPI data beat expectations by a wide margin. It also depends on what the Fed chair Powell will say next week.""  Focus on DXY's triangle  The DXY's monthly chart shows the greenback has formed a triangle pattern identified by connecting January 2017 and March 2020 highs and February 2018 and January 2021 lows.  A potential triangle breakout might pave the way for a notable bull run.

Unfortunately, February did not benefit investors and the price recovery. In the weekly timeframe, we see that all attempts by buyers to impose a struggle end in closing the weekly candle below the opening price and big pins up. The local initiative of sellers, supported by the black trend line from March 2021, is still unbreakable. At the same time, trading volumes remain corrective and even close to those that were during the active phase of ALICE growth in August 2021. The nearest price zone that can stop this powerful wave of fall is in the range of $4.8. Starting from this mark, the fall wave slowed down in May 2021. Yes, this mark could not withstand the pressure and the price went down for a while. https://www.tradingview.com/x/74qkddNj/ However, it was in the range of $4.8 that the set of buyers&apos; positions for the new growth wave began. In principle, if you look globally, the zone of ​​accumulation of buyers&apos; positions was in the wide range of $4.8-$7. Therefore there is a high probability of stopping the ALICE price fall earlier. Given this fact, the high probability of the price falling to $4.8 will be when the BTC price falls in the range of $30,000.

The negotiation for the acquisition started in October 2021 wherein the two parties started a long negotiation with the National Bank of Romania. The central bank finally decided on 8 March in favour of the acquisition of Twispay by Elrond after coming to the conclusion that blockchain technology plays a fundamentally important role in the evolution of finance.The post Romanian Central Bank Approves Elrond to Acquire Twispay appea...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | ZRX,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/romanian-central-bank-approves-elrond-to-acquire-twispay/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

If back in December 2021 we saw a struggle of buyers, then after the weekly candle of 17 January there is no resistance. During the last 7 trading weeks, sellers have been systematically and without much aggression pushing the LINK price down. The result is 25% of the LINK cryptocurrency value. Sellers were able to push the LINK price below the local liquidity range of $15.8. However, this did not give the current growth wave or acceleration or increase in volumes. It seems that although sellers now dominate the market - it is clearly lacking gasoline for the active phase of the fall. https://www.tradingview.com/x/aU5gTrYF/ In the weekly timeframe, you can see how the LINK price hung in the consolidation, forming a red wedge. Our main scenario at the moment is a rebound of the LINK price to $20.5 over the next few weeks. A fairly positive scenario does not mean that the LINK correction, which began in May 2021, is over. Globally, we see the price moving in a black downward trend channel. If we continue the quiet correction, we expect the final target of LINK cryptocurrency to fall at $8. It is at this point that there will be a good chance to buy LINK in the long run. If the price movements dynamics and trading volumes remain unchanged, the completion of the LINK price correction is possible in the summer. ...",NEUTRAL,LINK,LINK | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/link-technical-analysis-what-keeps-the-price-from-falling-to-7/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

The project's ICX token jumped from a low of $0.61 on Wednesday to over $1.04 on Thursday morning before retracing some of the gain. The price is still some 92% below the 2018 peak of $13.  Price charts suggest the token may drop to a support level at $0.70 if current buying pressure is not sustained.  ICX is a prominent project whose protocol allows separate blockchains to exchange data with each other. It was one of the top performers in the initial coin offering frenzy of 2017 before losing favor among investors in the years afterward.  South Korean exchange UpBit continues to see tens of millions worth of ICX traded daily, data show. Wednesday, however, saw over $410 million in volume on the ICX/Korean won trade pair. UpBit posted trading volumes of over $4 billion in total, more than twice the $1.8 billion traded on Sunday.  Other projects with Korean ties saw similar price jumps. Singapore-based Terra, started life in South Korea, saw prices of its LUNA tokens cross an all-time high of $103 in early Asian hours.  Gains in LUNA were also driven by strong demand for sister token terraUSD (UST), an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, as reported.  Yoon was a former top prosecutor who promised to deregulate the crypto industry. Both he and his opponent, Lee Jae-myung of the ruling Liberal Party, announced crypto-friendly measures to win over younger voters, as reported.  Yoon has promised to raise the proposed threshold for the 20% capital-gains tax on cryptocurrency profits to KRW 52.4 million (US$42,450). This is higher than the current KRW 2.5 million threshold due to start in 2023. He also promised to ""take legal measures to confiscate crypto profits gained through illegitimate means and return them to the victims.”  The current government under President Moon Jae-in has cracked down on crypto in South Korea, which became one of the biggest markets for the asset class with a young, tech-friendly population.

Elrond, which recently acquired payments gateway Utrust, did not disclose the financial details of the acquisition, but the blockchain’s CEO, Beniamin Mincu, called it a “landmark decision” on the part of a European central bank.  “This shows that central banks may be switching from a counterpoint to the crypto space, toward a more neutral or even potentially favorable point,” Mincu said in an interview with CoinDesk.

CoinDesk data shows the top cryptocurrency by market value fell to $39,000 during Asia hours, nearly reversing Wednesday's 8% spike brought by U.S. President Joe Biden's crypto executive order.  ""Market dropped again around 1:30 UTC during the Asian trading on long liquidations washouts which are still dominating the leverage markets,"" Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund expert and director of CEC Capital, said. ""Any potential of a pullback seems futile due to the selling pressures these liquidations create.""  The euro-dollar exchange rate (EUR/USD) was flat at around 1.1065, having bounced nearly 200 pips (usually the last decimal place of price) in the preceding two days, according to TradingView.  Historically, the U.S. Federal Reserve has had the biggest impact on crypto markets and ECB rate decisions have had little to no relevance. However, Thursday's decision is pivotal, according to one observer.  ""At present, we already know that the Fed will raise interest rates, so no matter how the U.S. market changes, this thing will happen. The most considerable influence at the moment may be the hawkishness of the European Central Bank this week,"" said Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto-asset management company Blofin.  ""Any unexpected move by the ECB could trigger a fall in the market,"" Ardern added.  The ECB is scheduled to announce its decision on monetary policy on Thursday, March 10, at 12:45 GMT (7:45 a.m. ET). ECB's President Christine Lagarde will hold a news conference at 13:30 UTC, or 45 minutes after the ECB's policy announcement.  Markets have recently scaled back expectations for the ECB tightening as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is expected to push the European economy into recession characterized by high inflation.  According to Refinitiv data, as of Wednesday, money markets had priced in an ECB interest rate rise of less than 15 basis points in December versus a 30 basis point hike before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.  According to Chris Vecchio, strategist at DailyFX, the looming threat of liquidity crisis in Europe may see ECB delay policy tightening.  ""There is a non-zero chance that the European and U.S. sanctions on the Central Bank of Russia provoke a liquidity crunch for European banks that persists for the foreseeable future. In turn, this may be providing the excuse ECB officials need to justify keep their asset purchase program in place through 3Q'22, and interest rates lower for longer,"" Vecchio said in an email.  Most investment banks foresee the ECB keeping the policy stance unchanged while adopting a more flexible stance on inflation, according to FXStreet.  Traders will also be watching the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data for February, due for release at 13:30 GMT (8:30 a.m. ET). ""The consensus forecast is for acceleration in the headline reading from 7.5 to 7.8%. I think the risk is for an even larger increase in prices,"" John Kicklighter, strategist at DailyFX, said.

The stolen funds were later swapped for over 1,007 ether (ETH) – about $2.6 million at current prices – using privacy protocol Tornado Cash, which allows for anonymous token swaps.  The Fantasm developers said in a follow-up tweet that some of the FTM collateral was “white hacked,” a process that refers to exploiting a protocol to flag security concerns or, in this case, recover tokens at the risk of getting hacked.  Fantasm Finance, launched earlier this month, is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project aimed at developing synthetic tokens for the Fantom ecosystem. DeFi broadly refers to the use of smart contracts instead of third parties for providing financial services to users, while synthetic tokens are blockchain-based representations of financial assets, such as other cryptocurrencies.  Fantasm developers said a compensation plan for affected users was being worked out.  Meanwhile, Pitimanaaree cautioned in a tweet that additional vulnerabilities related to Fantasm’s flash-loan product might still exist.",NEGATIVE,ETH | FTM,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | FTM | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/10/fantom-based-algo-protocol-fantasm-exploited-for-26m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f80239e24d8f36b4140576c9108626a7547c157-1500x954.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum Gas fees are Now as Low as $8 At the time of writing, the average layer one (L1) Ethereum gas fee is 0.0031 ETH or $8.06 per transfer. The last time average gas costs on Ethereum were this low was seven months ago on August 4, 2021, at $10. Similarly, median-sized ether fees are low as well at 0.0014 ETH or $3.5 per transfer. The most probable cause of the reduced gas fees could be linked to the recent decline in NFT trades. To understand the correlation between the drop in Ethereum&apos;s gas fees and NFTs, one just needs to observe how the trading volume on OpenSea declined from $247 million to $124 million from February 1 to February 6, during which the median gas fee also fell from 134 gwei to 65 gwei. This essentially shows that an increase in NFT transactions also leads to a surge in ETH gas fees, while a drop in the transaction volume also affects it. Along with NFTs, Ethereum-based DeFi projects are also suffering from eight out of the top 10 projects all-seeing red over the past month in terms of total value locked (TVL) and native asset token price, according to data from DappRadar.The post Ethereum Gas Fees Drop to Lowest Levels in 7 Months appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ICO | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/ethereum-gas-fees-drop-to-lowest-levels-in-7-months/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42395859,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzbdl,1646898214,THORChain’s RUNE Surges 37% After DeFi Synthetic Assets Goes Live,"Cross-chain protocol THORChain went live with synthetic assets trading on its platform earlier Thursday morning, causing prices of its native token RUNE to jump as much as 37% from Wednesday's lows of $4.05 to Thursday's peak of $5.56.  Synthetic assets – or blockchain-based representations of another asset, such as crypto – are backed by half the value of their underlying asset and half in RUNE. This allows users to hold and trade a representative of a layer 1, or base, blockchain asset faster and at a lower cost.  THORChain allows trustless trading and token swaps for several cryptocurrencies, from bitcoin (BTC) to ether (ETH), via RUNE. Using RUNE as an intermediary allows for the trading of assets from one network to be traded for another in a decentralized manner without using smart contract-based “bridges.”  Trustless trading is a system where participants need not know the identity of other participants.  Synthetics will increase network usage, network total value locked (TVL), pool depth, thus cheaper swap fees, and generate greater income for liquidity providers, as per a developer note. The update was activated by a two-thirds majority of distributed node operators.  Synthetics increases the demand for RUNE within the network, which in turn increases their appeal among liquidity providers who provide the underlying tokens in return for a fee reward.  This allows all synthetic assets to be redeemed on a 1:1 basis with the underlying asset – meaning a synthetic bitcoin on THORChain will readily and easily be redeemable for one bitcoin.  The first synthetic was created minutes after the protocol went live. Some 0.00054906 worth of bitcoin was staked for a bitcoin synthetic, blockchain data show.  RUNE surged over 37% in the past 24 hours as the synthetic update went live to weekly highs of $5.56 in early Asian hours. It since dropped 60 cents as traders took profits amid a broader market downturn. Prices are up 40% in the past two weeks but are down 76% from lifetime highs of $20.87, as per CoinGecko.  Tokens prices of THORSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on the THORChain protocol, were up 11% in the past 24 hours. The DEX allows users to earn yields and provide liquidity within the THORChain ecosystem.  Thursday's release comes months after THORChain was exploited for $8 million in July 2021.

Bitcoin&apos;s astonishing price gains since then means that the funds are now worth more than $20.4 million at today&apos;s market price. Cryptocurrency lovers have particular interest in coins mined before the mysterious bitcoin founder vanished on Dec. 12, 2010. The coins are now referred to as the Satoshi Era Bitcoins. The interest arises from the belief that wallets created during this period belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, or his close associates. There are hundreds of bitcoin wallet addresses that have remained inactive in the last decade, according to data from BitInfoCharts.

Sadin will be responsible for helping developers integrate digital assets into their games or launch tokens, the company said Thursday.  FTX established the dedicated gaming unit in February.  “We’re putting players first and creating open economies powered by the blockchain that grant players true asset ownership,” Sadin said in a press release. “We’re making it possible for developers to create in-game assets that players will pass down to their future grandchildren.”  During his time at WB Games’ Boston studio, Sadin launched “Game of Thrones: Conquest.” In earlier roles, he was involved in a number of hit games and worked with well-known franchises like Batman, WWE and The Walking Dead.  In January, FTX launched a $2 billion venture fund run by Amy Wu, formerly of Lightspeed Venture Partners. Part of the fund’s remit is to invest in crypto gaming projects.  Before he was at WB Games, Sadin was a vice president at Sega, responsible for the company’s free-to-play Sonic games.  Gaming giant Ubisoft included NFTs alongside “Ghost Recon: Breakpoint,” but they were met with a lukewarm reception from fans with on-chain data suggesting that the company has only sold a few hundred dollars worth of the themed non-fungible tokens (NFT).

42411514,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOSq6,1646874000,GameFi Is a New Game for Southeast Asia Players,"In Asia, for the parents of generations X and Y, video games were often the source of headaches and arguments with their children. As teenagers immersed themselves in the virtual world of fire-spitting dragons, club-wielding warlords and magical sorcery, parents worried their kids were wasting their time and money on activities that would yield little value in the long run.  Fast forward to 2022. In Manila, Philippines, not only has the social stigma on video game players disappeared but skilled players are hailed as smart, resourceful entrepreneurs who are helping to usher the country into the digital era. Such an increasingly positive view of video game players is spreading throughout Southeast Asia. This transformed perception hinges heavily on one phenomenon: GameFi.  Read more: GameFi’s Promise and Reality Are Still Worlds Apart  GameFi, also known as “play-to-earn” (P2E), is the financialization of gaming by leveraging blockchain technology. In the beginning, video games started with a pay-to-play model before transitioning into the standard freemium model.  Today, players in the GameFi world can earn and trade digital assets that can be converted into fiat to help supplement everyday financial transactions. Simply put, many of the so-called “game addicts” whom their parents worried about are now monetizing their talents and creating a sustainable income stream for themselves and their families.  Digital native and early adopters  GameFi is undoubtedly a monumental game-changer for Southeast Asia, and current economic conditions and fast-spreading digital adoption in the region could make it the global capital of the P2E model.  According to official data, only around 30% of adults in the Philippines have traditional bank accounts, compared with close to 100% in neighboring Asia countries, including South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam also have populations that are relatively unbanked.  However, among the top 15 countries that use MetaMask, the Philippines ranked first with the most active users, followed by Vietnam (third), India (sixth), Indonesia (ninth) and Thailand (10th). These rankings offer evidence that many people in Southeast Asian countries are bypassing traditional banking routes and are quickly adopting Web 3 applications.  Moreover, the income that many players in the region earn from P2E games is enough to make a living or greatly supplement their current income. This scenario differs from the U.S. and other countries with high costs of living, where P2E income is not as important for people to support themselves. Southeast Asia will remain fertile ground for GameFi to flourish.  For this reason, my company, Infinity Venture Crypto (IVC), has allocated a sizable portion of its inaugural fund, capped at $70 million, to support the development of blockchain projects globally with a focus on Southeast Asia.  For example, Axie Infinity, one of the world’s most popular blockchain games with more than 8.3 million players, is the creation of Vietnamese studio Sky Mavis, and has the most active users in the Philippines. Yield Guild Games (YGG), one of IVC’s portfolio companies, is a Philippines-based gaming guild decentralized autonomous organization that invests in NFTs (non-fungible tokens) used in blockchain-based games and virtual worlds.  Read more: Fintech Platform Cake DeFi Creates $100M Venture Capital Arm  To participate in P2E games, players require access to in-game NFTs, which can often be beyond their financial reach. By lending NFTs to its community members, commonly known as scholars, YGG is financially appealing to players who want to use their gaming skills to bring home extra bacon. COVID-19, which left many players jobless, also supercharged the development of P2E games in Southeast Asia.  GameFi’s pain points  While the P2E industry is off to breakneck speed in Southeast Asia, many trailblazers are struggling to keep up with the momentum. They must still address bottlenecks that are preventing players from joining P2E games more easily and hindering the acceleration of the GameFi ecosystem in Southeast Asia. An example is the lack of guild customer relationship management (CRM) software to help track scholars’ performance and withdrawals. Guilds and scholar managers now use Google sheets and Excel to do the work. Another pain point is the difficulty for scholars to convert and use the in-game tokens they earned to spend in real life.  Entrepreneurs in Southeast Asia understand these weaknesses better than anyone else and have been working to solve them, not only because they are located at the heart of the GameFi ecosystem, but also because they see the need for better software to support GameFi's massive growth and ensure that the industry can continue to scale.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Brian Lu,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/10/gamefi-is-a-new-game-for-southeast-asia-players,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ea578373c2b70c893db7159270ee52d9d0401f6-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

JustCarbon opened a marketplace for its JustCarbon Removal Units (JCRs), it said Thursday. Likvidi announced a platform for its Liquid Carbon Credit (LCO2) on Wednesday.  Both LCO2 and JCRs are blockchain versions of carbon credits issued by Verra (VCS). JCRs also represent credits issued by Gold Standard. Each is equivalent to 1 metric ton of carbon.  The two companies join a growing band of institutions exploring how blockchain technology can be used to improve environmental management. China introduced a carbon trading system last summer, and late last year the University of Cambridge said it was working on a similar project, looking to develop a blockchain-based market for trading carbon credits that will support reforestation projects to preserve biodiversity through the Cambridge Centre for Carbon Credits.  ""The world is now waking up to the challenge of reducing carbon emissions. Governments alone won’t achieve this,"" Likvidi CEO and co-founder Ransu Salovaara said in an emailed statement.  JustCarbon aims to build a transparent and effective “nature-based carbon sequestration marketplace,” it said in a press release. The project also wants to provide a way for smaller companies to offset and trade their greenhouse-gas emissions. The tokens have been built to operate cross-chain and will be tradable on third-party exchanges from today.  Buying a carbon credit gives the holder the right to offset one metric ton of carbon or greenhouse gas equivalent. In order to obtain an offset, the token must be destroyed.  JustCarbon's platform will be administered by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which means that no single entity or vested interest group will own or control it. A separate token, the JustCarbon Governance Unit (JCG), will facilitate community voting and decision making for the DAO.  Likvidi is working with DAO Maker. The platform will run on Avalanche.  JustCarbon has also partnered with NFT Design Works, a creator and curator of digital collectables, so that non-fungible tokens (NFT) can benefit from carbon offsetting.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/10/justcarbon-likvidi-launch-blockchain-markets-for-carbon-credits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49c4d645d516e9a794904bf6cf38592a1df66997-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
