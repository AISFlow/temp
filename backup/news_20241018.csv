34865816,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648709,1729294246,100% Uptick For Shiba Inu? Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is now priced at about $0.00001783, just below a key resistance zone which means that the market is in a good mood. Market analysts are ready to witness another possible rally in the meme coin space. Related Reading: Market Data Hints At 500x XRP Rally In Upcoming Altcoin Season Crypto influencer Davinci Jeremie noted that during the last bull cycle, Dogecoin (DOGE) reached a market cap of $88.8 billion, while SHIB peaked at $40 billion. The bull run will take the market cap of meme coins to a trillion dollars. Last cycle we saw $DOGE coin hit $88.8 billion market cap & $SHIB hit $40 billion. I think we’ll see memes as an asset class hit close to $1 trillion market cap this cycle — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) October 17, 2024 Currently, the market capitalization of meme coins has surged to $58 billion, although still behind other up-and-coming crypto sectors such as AI-based tokens and real-world asset cryptos, but still a solid amount nonetheless. On the bullish side, investors would have a pretty good chance of significant profits upon its break from resistance levels into $0.000028, with the current momentum at their side, there is hope that the rest of the meme coins might also witness good performance, too. The Current Status Of Meme Coins It might have ended its global trend reversal and gone off a prior downtrend but do not count it out yet since during the late parts of September 2024, SHIB saw a huge spike as it recorded an all-time high at $0.00002135. This peak successfully broke two strong resistance levels which can only mean good for the coin and other meme coins. From the technical analysis from PS Trade, there is a high resistance point that is at $0.00002052 where around 83.75 trillion tokens are kept at this price level. $SHIB Although the price of #SHIBUSDT is still not rising very confidently on the 3-day timeframe, the global downward trend reversal structure is complete. Therefore, our target for this cryptocurrency is 100% growth. pic.twitter.com/DhOcxx3j1T — PS trade (@PStrade2) October 16, 2024 PS Trade said the global downward trend reversal structure is complete even if the price of SHIBUSDT is still not increasing very strongly on the three-day period. For this coin, he said their aim is therefore 100% increase. It was found that by the end of September, a double local top had been formed in two successive days above its high made in the middle of July. However, the strongest resistance band lies between $0.000018 and $0.000020 since 439.16 trillion tokens are dispersed across 45,620 wallets. If the bullish trend of SHIB continues, then it might test the next major hurdle at $0.000028.

As the CMF is still negative at – 0.22, this presents selling pressure from the large holders. Meanwhile, the StochRSI has revealed that SHIB was already entering into an overbought position due to its values oscillating between 71 and 57. That makes it important that the oscillators and charts begin to show signs of short-term volatility and further corrections if the selling pressure continues. However, given the strong bullish setup, a further rally is quite possible. Investors need to keep an eye on key resistance levels as well as technical indicators for further movements in SHIB.

42373546,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnzfj,1729294200,It Takes a Fake Token to Catch a Volume Faker,"Last week, the Department of Justice announced charges against over a dozen individuals and entities, arguing these market makers were wash trading funds and defrauding people. One of the names was familiar to long-time CoinDesk readers.  PS: I'll be at Flyover Fintech in Lincoln, Nebraska on Monday.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  'Not entirely ethical'  The narrative  Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice brought charges against a number of people and companies including Gotbit, CLS Global, MyTrade, and ZM Quant, alleging these companies were wash trading cryptos, and their operators and some token promoters were defrauding investors as a result.  Why it matters  Wash trading isn't exactly a massive secret in this industry – as I'll get to further down – but it's still a market signal that can portend poorly.  Breaking it down  Alexey Andryunin told former CoinDesk reporter Anna Baydakova in 2019 that he co-founded a company designed to make it appear that random small-cap cryptocurrencies had real trading volume, with the express purpose of making these tokens appear active enough to secure a listing on CoinMarketCap and draw attention from larger companies.  At the time, Andryunin said, ""The business is not entirely ethical.""  Five years later, prosecutors appear to agree. Andryunin was arrested in Portugal for extradition to the U.S.  You can read Anna's 2019 report at this link.  The other interesting detail: The FBI worked on its own fake token, with a real contract you could track on-chain, called NexFundAI. Its website, which now features a massive ""FBI"" banner, looked remarkably legit – that is to say, like a lot of other AI-focused crypto tokens making vague but extravagant promises.  Stories you may have missed  India's Crypto Discussion Paper on Hold Due to Other Priorities: India was supposed to publish a policy discussion paper on crypto last month, but didn't.

FTX's Salame Hoped Dog Bite Would Delay Prison, But Tucker Carlson Derailed Effort: Ryan Salame went on a press tour (and updated his LinkedIn) ahead of reporting to prison last week, while also asking a federal judge to delay his incarceration date to December for medical reasons. The Department of Justice said he looked fine during his Tucker Carlson appearance, a comment the judge quoted in denying Salame's request.  Kamala Harris Speech Offers No Further Details on Crypto 'Regulatory Framework': Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign published a policy document saying she would support a crypto regulatory framework, but did not elaborate during public remarks later in the day.  Bitnomial Exchange Sues U.S. SEC, Alleging Regulatory Overreach: What's really interesting about Bitnomial suing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission here is the suggestion that the SEC still wants to call XRP a security, something Ripple executives have denied could happen.

Over the years, despite the crypto price boom and bust cycle, the platform has operated flawlessly without any technical hitches. Aave User Address Grew By 675% In One Week Since the beginning of the year, Aave has dominated headlines, mostly around its price performance and rising TVL. However, looking at other metrics, the lending platform is performing solidly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $95,000? Here’s What Needs To Happen First According to Santiment, Aave on Optimism is the fastest-growing protocol on their watch among platforms, commanding at least $500 million in TVL. The number of Aave addresses on Optimism grew by 675%, roughly twice that of KuCoin tokens (KCS). At this pace, Aave outperformed Maker–another lending and borrowing protocol on Ethereum, Chainlink on Optimism, and Raydium–a top decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana. Of note, Chainlink on Optimism and Raydium grew over the last week by 100%. The fact that Aave on Optimism grew faster than Raydium, the top DEX on Solana, is a milestone. By default, any meme coin launching on Pumpfun that achieves at least 69 SOL automatically lists on Raydium. Although only a small percentage graduate and are listed on Raydium, tens of thousands of meme coins launch on the meme coin launchpad on Solana. Santiment now thinks AAVE prices may likely benefit from this growth. Pointing to historical performance, the sentiment analytics platform said there is usually a strong correlation between rising utility and consistent growth with long-term gains. According to Dune, there are over 49,800 unique daily users of Aave v3 on Ethereum. Over the last two days, there were 70 new users. While there is growth in the number of cumulative users, as expected, the number of new users remains steady. Will Prices Rise To Fresh 2024 Highs? AAVE is trading above $150, trending at around 2024 highs. Although the token is in an uptrend, prices have moved sideways over the past four weeks. Technically, a close above $180 could drive demand, lifting prices to new 2024 highs in the coming days. Possible drivers include the recovery of DeFi and other project-related factors. As of October 17, 56% of all cbBTC–the Bitcoin stablecoin by Coinbase–was locked in Aave.

42373570,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYlloBiN,1729285868,"The Fed’s Rate Cut Trajectory Remains Intact, Boosting the Crypto Outlook","Last week’s inflation report did little to change the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle.  Over the last few weeks, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds has quickly jumped from 3.6% to 4.1%. The underlying driver of the change has been a swap by quant-driven fund managers. They’ve rotated out of fixed-income investments into equities. As bond prices have fallen, yields have jumped.  But that hasn’t stopped the stock-market doomsayers from trying to capitalize. They’re trying to pull every lever possible to say that stocks can’t keep rallying. But they’re not paying attention to the bigger picture story.  Lately the narrative has focused on why our central bank can’t cut interest rates. A couple of weeks ago the new government in Japan was hell bent on tightening so we couldn’t afford to cut to keep our bonds attractive. Last week, the economy was running too hot because payroll gains were stronger than anticipated, implying easing would fuel inflation.  The first story was quickly rebutted when Japan’s new prime minister said the economy can’t handle rate hikes right now. The second story was dismissed when domestic policy makers said the September employment gains aren’t enough to change the broader employment slowdown.  This week, the negative nellies were at it once again. They said higher-than-anticipated consumer price index (“CPI”) growth for September meant rate cuts are off the table. But this time like before, they weren’t focusing on the broader picture. Because if we forget about short-term expectations, we see the long-term inflation trend is headed in one steady direction down. That means our central bank will have plenty of room to lower interest rates well into next year, underpinning a steady rally in risk assets like crypto.  But don’t take my word for it, let’s look at what the data’s telling us.  The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported September CPI growth of 2.4% compared to the expectation for 2.3%. Now, while that may be a disappointment compared to what economists had predicted, when we view it relative to August's 2.5% increase, that’s still a move in the right direction.  In the above chart, you’ll notice yesterday’s result marked the lowest rate of CPI growth since February 2021. And you can also see the metric is quickly approaching pre-pandemic levels.  But let’s drill down a little further. Let’s look at the monthly growth trend on a quarterly basis.  As you can see from the above chart, price pressures appear to have a defined trend over the course of the year. From January through March, CPI averaged a 0.6% increase. In the April through June span, prices increased at a rate of 0.3%. And for the last three months, the pace of growth has held steady around 0.1%. Clearly a steady slowdown.  So now, we want to go back and look at the trend over the last few years. This way we can see if the activity this year is out of whack.  Well, based on the numbers since 2021, the rate of monthly inflation growth tends to slow throughout the year. And as we've moved further away from the effects of COVID stimulus, we can see the slowdown has accelerated.  Our chart shows us that inflation growth typically runs the hottest in the first two quarters of the year. Then, in the third and fourth quarters, it can slow to almost a crawl. In fact, in the fourth quarter of 2022 there wasn’t any growth, while the end of last year saw CPI contract. The implication being inflation growth should slow more over the next three months.  But we want to get an idea of whether economic trends are returning to normal. Because, if they are, it means the Fed can also return interest rates back to more normal levels. So, let’s look at what the pace of monthly growth has done the last few years relative to the pre-pandemic average.  In 2021-2022, when inflation was exploding higher, the average pace of monthly growth was 0.6%. In other words, CPI expanded at roughly 7.2% per year. But as interest rates shot up, the pace of monthly growth has slowed. In 2023, the average month-over-month growth was 0.3%, or 3.6% annualized, while year-to-date it has averaged 0.2%, or 2.4% annualized. For pre-COVID levels, I ran the numbers from 2009 through 2019. What I found was that inflation rose just over 0.15% per month.  Based on the numbers, it would appear the trend for inflation is returning back toward pre-pandemic levels of normal. So, I modeled what annualized growth would look like if that’s the trend going forward…  Based on the result, CPI could be back below the Fed’s 2% target as soon as February. In other words, within the next five months, our central bank could be close to achieving one of its primary goals since it started raising rates in March 2022.  The last thing we want to look at is what kind of room the Fed has to lower rates. Well, the difference between the effective fed funds rate and annualized CPI growth, following the release of the September data, sits at 250 basis points.  That’s one of the highest levels going back to 2000. More importantly, it tells us that the Fed can lower rates by that same amount before policy no longer weighs on inflation.  So, like I said at the start, the stock-market boo-birds are trying everything they can to try and get equity prices lower. But in the process, they’re hoping everyone will get caught up in the noise and not pay attention to the signal.  Currently, Wall Street expects borrowing costs to drop from 4.9% today to 3.4% by October of next year. Based on the numbers we just looked at, the Fed has plenty of room to do that right now. And it would still have a cushion of another 100 basis points.  But why waste the bullets if you don’t have to? Instead, our central bank can take its time and save the ammo for when it really needs it. The change should support stable economic growth and a steady rally in risk assets like bitcoin and ether.

34861162,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648694,1729283435,"Crypto Craze: Investor Nets A 3,360% Gain, Turning $86,000 Into $3.75 Million","In another fabulous story from the crypto market, an investor has realized a staggering 3,360% return, transforming an initial investment of $86,000 into approximately $3.9 million. This extraordinary gain was achieved through an investment in the memecoin Goatseus Maximus (GOAT). According to a report by on-chain analysis firm Lookonchain, the investor allocated 603 SOL (worth $86,000) to purchase 10.7 million GOAT tokens six days prior. At its peak, this investment surged to $3.75 million. Within the past eight hours, the investor liquidated 0.7 million GOAT tokens, converting them back into 1,453 SOL ($222,000), thereby retaining 10 million GOAT tokens valued at approximately $2.74 million. Additionally, the trader invested $182,000 in 7.3 million BILLY tokens, which he sold after four months for $593,000, yielding a 226% return. Thus, the anonymous crypto investor made a staggering $3.291 million profit with both trades. Crypto’s Latest Memecoin Sensation The memecoin GOAThas garnered significant attention within the crypto community. Initially conceptualized by an anonymous developer using Solana’s memecoin creation app, Pump Fun, GOAT was not the direct creation of Andy Ayrey, the developer behind the AI bot Truth Terminal. However, the AI’s influence played a pivotal role in its virality. Related Reading: How The Israel-Iran War Could Shake Crypto Prices, Explains Arthur Hayes Andy Ayrey, a digital innovator, developed Truth Terminal as an experiment in memetic engineering rather than crypto creation. Truth Terminal, trained on Meta’s Llama 3.1 model, engaged in extensive dialogues across platforms like X, Reddit, and 4chan, eventually fixating on the Goatsee meme—a notorious early internet shock image. These interactions inadvertently inspired the creation of the GOAT memecoin, which launched on October 13 and rapidly escalated to a market capitalization of $360 million within four days. As of the latest data, GOAT’s market cap has slightly tapered to just over $335 million, with the token trading at approximately $0.33. Andy Ayrey acknowledged the unexpected success of GOAT, stating, “This isn’t a crypto project; it’s a study in memetic contagion and the tail risks of unsupervised infinite idea generation in the age of LLMs.” He further elaborated, “This memecoin taking off is proving a thesis I’m building an AI alignment and safety company around; which is where the bulk of my skin in the game lies.” Related Reading: Why This Crypto Asset Is Bitwise CIO’s Best Contrarian Bet Right Now Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, initially provided a $50,000 Bitcoin grant to Truth Terminal for independent AI research. Amid the GOAT token surge, Andreessen clarified his non-involvement with the memecoin: “For clarity, I sent a personal $50K no-string-attached unconditional research grant to Truth Terminal and its creator Andy Ayrey this summer . However, I have nothing to do with the GOAT memecoin. I was not involved in creating it, play no role in it, have no economics in it, and do not own any of it.” GOAT’s rapid ascent and subsequent stabilization highlight the continued appetite among crypto traders for high-risk, high-reward memecoins rather than fundamental utility. Truth Terminal’s role as a catalyst in GOAT’s success exemplifies the profound impact that AI-driven narratives can have on digital asset valuations At press time, GOAT traded at $0.3520.

42373559,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYlloAx3,1729280023,The Promise of Trustless Environmental Monitoring,"Despite myriad benefits to proactively address the consequences of climate change, society remains focused on expensive remediation as opposed to adaptation and prevention. This is in part due to the absence of accurate and transparent data to inform mitigation strategies.  Existing monitoring systems suffer from significant limitations including inconsistent data collection, manipulation, fraud, and delayed reporting, making it extremely difficult to create the necessary regulatory policy or proactively allocate resources. This hamstrings our collective ability to adapt to the worst effects of climate change.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  Blockchain could be the answer to the reliable, consistent environmental monitoring we need for climate planning. We at Montauk Climate Corporation (MCC) – a venture studio launched in 2023 by veteran climate operators and investors – have developed a thesis to address this data deficit by building a trustless environmental data aggregation system built on the pillars of cybernetics and DePIN. This technology is at the core of one of our recent investments, Raad.  Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) connected to real-time data collection through a distributed and decentralized Internet of Things (IoT) network eliminates the potential for data tampering, enforces data control and encourages widespread participation. The IoT network allows for rapid response to sudden environmental changes, while the blockchain-based foundation allows for a streamlined incentive structure, facilitating one of the first non-esoteric use cases for blockchain technologies. The blockchain application also enables multi-stakeholder sources of truth, and creates a data commons and consensus for the physical world through multi-source data oracles.  The core of the system lies in a globally distributed and decentralized network of IoT environmental sensors that can be deployed by anyone, anywhere. This model creates a distributed, trustless system that is highly fault-tolerant, supports multi-stakeholder consensus, and verifies data through multiple independent sources. Unlike centralized systems, which depend on a limited number of expensive sensors managed by a single institution, decentralized data collection eliminates reliance on a sole source of truth and allows for public auditing. It is also a core principle of Bitcoin – ensuring that no single entity controls the data flow, eliminating manipulation risk.  Blockchain technology provides a tamper-proof and transparent ledger for data storage, and smart contracts validate incoming data against predefined criteria, further establishing a “data commons” for validation, consensus, and integrity.  This framework offers a path towards enhanced data integrity, continuous monitoring, and global coverage, while simultaneously creating a community around environmental and meteorological data. With DePIN, we can incentivize the rapid development of a decentralized sensor network that distributes ownership and control of physical infrastructure among various stakeholders.  The system also incorporates self-regulating feedback loops within the monitoring system, enabling dynamic adjustments to incentives based on collected data. These cybernetic feedback loops allow the system to self-regulate through smart contracts and a DAO framework, and optimizes its data collection strategies, making it self-governing. Additionally, this creates a dynamic adaptive control solution that aligns incentives to deploy more sensors, increasing speed of adoption and systemic growth.  One of the key use cases for this technology is methane monitoring. Methane emissions are an emerging concern under the United States’ environmental regulatory scheme. While shorter-lived than carbon dioxide, methane has significantly higher global warming potential in the short term. Accurate monitoring and reporting are essential for developing effective mitigation strategies and enforcing accountability for emitters.  However, current monitoring systems suffer from limitations including inconsistent data collection, data manipulation, and delayed reporting. The most recent administration has implemented a methane tax as well as strict reporting requirements on all methane emitters nationally. Oil and gas companies will have to spend considerable capital on sensors and third-party measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV), and will no longer have an option to self-report. In addition to environmental liability, rogue emissions represent lost topline revenue for the conventional energy sector, giving additional impetus to remediate methane leaks in a timely manner.  Additional applications extend far beyond methane detection. The system can be adapted to monitor air quality in urban areas, water quality in rivers and lakes, and identify deforestation hotspots. By incorporating a more horizontal protocol approach to standardized data formats and interoperability, the system can seamlessly integrate data streams from various monitoring applications for a breadth of use cases. This view allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the interconnectedness of environmental systems and challenges, empowering the development of integrated and effective environmental policies. It provides policymakers, researchers, and the public with unprecedented access to reliable, real-time environmental data, empowering more informed decision-making, accelerating our response to climate change, and paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable future.  While logic behind the system is sound, challenges for adoption still remain. There have been attempts to deploy DePIN networks across other use cases including WiFi and 5G networks, vehicle information and mapping with various degrees of success. Token models, especially in the United States and in particular during an election year, are subject to regime-dependent regulatory and compliance risk. We will need to develop tamper-evident, zero-knowledge proofs and remote verification techniques to ensure the physical security and calibration of diversely deployed IoT devices.  Additionally, actors attempting to extract value from these incentive platforms will defraud the network with incorrect data when there is meaningful financial incentive. There is precedent in the early days of Helium and STEPN. Therefore, designing appropriate incentive structures for network participation and governance, and crafting voting models to establish penalties for fraud are crucial for the long-term sustainability of our systems, especially ones that rely on emerging economic models. It would also require the establishment of proper reputation-based scoring systems that reward reliable data providers to further incentivize participation and trust in the network.  The evolution of bottom-up, self-organizing communities combined with a DePIN-based business model presents a promising approach to creating trustless, transparent, and adaptive systems. As we face the growing challenges of a changing climate, solutions harnessing the power of emerging technologies and systems designed for self-governance and organic growth will become more critical than ever to prepare for the ramifications of a changing climate.

The cryptocurrency started the week strongly, and breached the $65K mark on Monday , with a sizable jump on the heels of China's latest economic stimulus plan that offered scant details. BTC then surpassed $67K on Tuesday for the first time in more than two months. The U.S. presidential race is another catalyst propping up crypto prices. In the past few days, prediction markets have shifted, now giving pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump better odds of winning than his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. ""A continued rebound in Trump's election odds plus positive macro sentiment continues to buoy crypto price action. BTC ETF has seen 5 consecutive days of positive inflows with Wednesday & Thursday both seeing over 450M of net buying,"" said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights, SOFA.org. In an eye-catching move, $559.9M flowed into 11 spot bitcoin ETFs on Monday, the largest amount since early June, according to data from London-based Farside Investors. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), the largest bitcoin fund, drew in $79.5M of that total. ""Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows have jumped in the last week, which likely caused their prices to jump, and we haven't seen any macro factors that could've caused this,"" said Jeff Mei, COO at crypto exchange, BTSE. ""The inflows are almost certainly due to euphoria leading up to the U.S. Presidential Election, as historically, volatility increases by about 20% in the time frame leading up to and after a Presidential election,"" Mei added. Notable News 25-year-old Eric Council Jr. was arrested, and charged with allegedly hacking the U.S. SEC's X account in January and posting a fake post regarding bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) exchange-traded funds, according to the Department of Justice. Deputy Finance Minister Maurizio Leo said that Italy plans to hike capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to 42% from 26%. Elon Musk's Tesla ( TSLA ) has reportedly transferred almost all $760M of bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) that it owns to unidentified wallets. World Liberty Financial , the cryptocurrency project backed by U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his family, started with some hiccups, as the website suffered numerous outages after going live and the public sale of the new WLFI token trailed the $300M fundraising goal by a wide margin. Bitcoin, Ether prices Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rose 3% to ~$69K, as it hovered near the $70K mark at 3:16 pm on Friday. Ether ( ETH-USD ) up 2.9% at $2.7K.

Related Reading: Solana Targets $160 Resistance As TVL Hits New Yearly Highs Recent price action for Ethereum has shown signs of strength, giving investors confidence that a potential breakout could be near. Ethereum is currently trading within a bullish pattern that, if broken, could lead to a massive surge in the coming weeks. With Bitcoin leading the way and market momentum building, ETH could be poised to follow, unlocking new gains and potentially signaling the start of a powerful rally for the altcoin. Investors are closely watching for signs that Ethereum will break free from its consolidation and begin to climb, as it remains one of the most closely monitored assets in the market. Ethereum Flirting With A Surge Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin has surged, leaving investors eagerly waiting for Ethereum to follow suit. Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt has shared his technical analysis on X, highlighting a bullish pattern emerging on Ethereum’s 1-hour price chart. Runefelt’s analysis points to an ascending triangle formation, which is generally a bullish indicator. According to him, if Ethereum manages to break above this pattern, a rapid surge to $2,870 could be imminent. This price level represents a key target for Ethereum, as it signals a strong upward move and confirms that the altcoin is catching up with Bitcoin’s recent performance. However, there are still risks that Ethereum could continue to trade sideways if it fails to break the current resistance level. In that case, ETH could remain trapped in consolidation for a longer period, which would cause further frustration among investors hoping for a rally. Related Reading: On-Chain Metrics Reveal Bitcoin Demand Is Growing – Can BTC Break ATHs In Q4? Despite these risks, market conditions favor Ethereum’s potential breakout as bullish sentiment grows. Analysts are watching closely, anticipating that Ethereum’s moment to surge could come soon, setting the stage for significant gains. Price Levels To Watch Ethereum (ETH) currently trades at $2,624 after three days of uncertainty and volatility. The price recently surged by 10% from the $2,400 area, showing signs of strength, but now faces a crucial resistance level. For the bulls to regain momentum, Ethereum needs to push above the current price and reclaim the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), which is $2,800. This significant level would signal that ETH is back on track for further upside, potentially catching up with Bitcoin’s recent gains. However, if Ethereum fails to break above this key resistance and reclaim the 200-day EMA, it risks entering a sideways consolidation phase. A failure to hold current levels could lead to a retrace, with support likely around the $2,450 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Target $3,400 Once It Breaks Above Bullish Pattern – Details Traders and investors are closely watching the price action as Ethereum’s next move will determine whether it can break free from its current uncertainty or continue to face resistance in the coming days.

Ondo's governance token spiked to 79 cents before paring gains, still up nearly 9% over the past 24 hours.  Tokenized money market funds as collateral allows traders to keep earning a yield while using them for margin for trading, as opposed to posting stablecoins for collateral.  Real-world asset tokenization platform Ondo Finance's governance token (ONDO) spiked 8% on Friday following a report about asset manager BlackRock's push to list its tokenized money market fund BUIDL as collateral on major derivatives exchanges.  According to Bloomberg's report, BlackRock and issuance partner Securitize are in early talks with crypto exchange giants including Binance, Deribit and OKX to accept BUIDL as margin for trading derivatives.  Ondo's token jumped to 79 cents immediately after the report, advancing 8% in an hour before paring some of the gains. It's price was still up nearly 9% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index's 2.2% daily gain.  While it is not clear how the development would impact the Ondo platform, its governance token has been a favored proxy play among crypto traders for BlackRock's tokenization push, moving abruptly on news related to the asset management giant. Notably, the token jumped as much as 20% when CoinDesk reported that BlackRock filed paperwork with Securitize to create the BUIDL offering. The token also moved when Ondo started to use BUIDL as the backing asset of its own retail-focused money market fund token (OUSG) to offer instant redemptions and conversions for Circle's USDC stablecoin.  Tokenized collateral push  BUIDL is the largest tokenized offering on the market with over $550 million of assets. Its price is fixed at $1 and offers money market yield to investors without leaving blockchain rails. It's offered to institutional investors and other protocols to invest or use it as reserve asset, with a minimum investment limit of $5 million.  Tokenized U.S. Treasuries, backed by short-term government bonds, have grown to a $2.3 billion asset class within crypto assets, tripling in size in a year. Funds, businesses and protocols using them as a vehicle to park their on-chain cash and earn yield fueled the growth. The next frontier for growth might be getting accepted as on-chain collateral asset.  The allure of using these tokens as collateral is that it allows traders to keep earning a yield while using them for margin for a trade, as opposed to posting stablecoins for collateral. Hashnote's $320 million USYC money market fund token got listed on Deribit as cross-margin collateral option earlier this month. Institutional trading services FalconX and Hidden Road already accept BUIDL as collateral asset.  State Street sees significant potential in tokenized collateral asset in traditional finance, too. Donna Milrod, the bank's chief product officer, said in an interview this month that collateral tokens could help mitigate liquidity stress during financial crises, for example allowing pension funds to post money market tokens for margin calls without selling underlying assets to raise cash.",POSITIVE,ONDO,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | ONDO,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/18/ondo-spikes-8-as-major-derivatives-exchanges-mull-blackrocks-buidl-as-collateral-option,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d841a6a52477349a3b902b2fb9ee87fc2235f92-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He said that both gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) and bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) are “different players on the same team” but maybe they are not playing together. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), he said, aspires to have the utility of money – “I think of it as exponential gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ), ( GLD ), or gold with an exponential network feature – but for bitcoin to compete with gold its adoption curve needs to continue to grow. He said that according to Metcalfe’s Law, if the adoption curve continues to grow, its valuation and price should grow as well. However, bitcoin’s price has “followed a boom-bust cycle in which it tends to dramatically overshoot and undershoot the underlying curve,” which makes sense only for an asset that is still young and ongoing price discovery. Credits to Fidelity. Moreover, this year, bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) curve has flattened. It has stayed at around 60,000 to 70,000 since late February, and with the number of addresses with a value of at least $1 stagnating at the 46M mark, said Timmer. Only due to its steep gain, at the beginning of the year (due to the onset of ETFs) the index is up 55.65% year-to-date. If bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has indeed become a mature asset that is less prone to boom-bust swings, it will be up to the shape of its adoption curve to drive the price further,” Timmer concluded. “Perhaps that acceleration is coming soon if the world is heading to a state of fiscal dominance, but for now it’s gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ), ( GLD ) that’s stealing the show.” More on Bitcoin USD: VanEck Mid-October Bitcoin ChainCheck Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Climbs Above $60K Bitcoin Eyes A Breakout, Have The Stars Finally Aligned?

42373561,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYlloB7Z,1729272661,"Crypto.com v. SEC Is a Bold, 'Bet the Company' Case","Last week, you probably saw that the cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com sued the SEC. Maybe you moved on with your day, orread on to see that the company is “seek[ing] declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') from unlawfully expanding its jurisdiction to cover secondary-market sales of certain network tokens.”  If you’re like me, you probably didn’t process this as big news. After all, cryptocurrency projects aresuing orbeing sued by the SEC all the time, and none of these have moved the needle. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said it filed the complaint to “protect the future of crypto” and, with all due respect, that kind of grandiose rhetoric made me think this case was just a posturing exercise.  When I dug a little bit, though, this Crypto.com began to look different. When I worked in Big Law, I specialized in what some people call “bet the company” litigation, and what Crypto.com set in motion in Texas last week might be just that.  Aaron Brogan is a managing attorney at Brogan Law PLLC.  Crypto.com’s complaint revealed it received a Wells notice from the SEC on Aug. 22. AWells notice is a letter from the SEC telling you you’re about to be sued. After you get one you present evidence that you are in compliance and beg the regulator not to bring the case, but more likely than not, one day soon, you’re getting summoned to court.  The SEC apparently accused Crypto.com of “operating as an unregistered broker-dealer and securities clearing agency” based on its business of facilitating secondary market trade in cryptocurrency tokens. This is because the SEC believes those tokens belong to a category of asset it classifies as “crypto asset securities,” over which it asserts authority.  Crypto.com could have just waited, but instead it took action. The way it did so suggests to me the company believes this case is existential.  First of all, the firm hired Noel Francisco, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to represent it. Former Solicitor Generals like Francisco and Uniswap’s counsel Don Verrilli represented the United States government in the Supreme Court. They are among the very best and most experienced appellate litigators in the country, and, one can safely guess, among the most expensive. You don’t hire Noel Francisco to posture. You hire Noel Francisco to go to war.  Perhaps serendipitously, Crypto.com had recently established a North American headquarters in Tyler, Texas (the Singapore-based firm previously had small satellite offices in Miami and Chicago). It signed the lease in May, just three months before receiving the Wells notice.The move placed Crypto.com squarely in the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (E.D.Tex). E.D.Tex., long famed for being the home of patent “forum shopping,"" is well known as one of the most conservative in the country, particularly when it comes to the authority of federal agencies.  Even more important than the district court is the appellate circuit it sits in. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is the singlemost influential court for anti-agency jurisprudence in the country. One recent case out of the circuit,Jarkesy v. SEC, significantly limited the SEC’s authority, and, when affirmed by the Supreme Court, changed the country's judicial landscape. Whatever Crypto.com's motivation was for relocating, if you’re in a fight to the death with the SEC, the Fifth Circuit is where you want to have it.  Crypto.com’s case is a little fiddly, to be fair. It relies on a judicial maneuver called a “declaratory judgment” that allows courts to “terminate controversies” concerning the“existence or nonexistence of any right, duty, power, liability, privilege, disability, or immunity or of any fact upon which such legal relations depend, or of a status.” These actions can be very difficult to prosecute because of the related doctrines of “justiciability” and “ripeness” through which courts abstain from “entangling themselves in abstract disputes.” Fundamentally, a declaratory judgment asks a court to determine rights in a forward-looking way, before a controversy arises, and courts prefer to wait for the controversy. Consensys justlost a declaratory judgment action in the Northern District of Texas for this reason, and the same could happen here.  But if it doesn’t, and the Wells notice Crypto.com received forms a sufficient basis for a declaratory action to proceed, Crypto.com may have perfectly aligned all the dominoes to finally knock down Chair Gensler’s regime. This action cuts across the SEC’s entire authority to regulate the cryptocurrency industry by challenging the bedrock upon which it is all built, the “crypto asset security.” Crypto.com argues that this category is made up out of “whole cloth” and cannot form a cogent basis for an enforcement authority consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The company cites case law from New York and D.C. district courts saying much the same, that “it is necessary to distinguish between the digital coins themselves and the offers to sell them” and that secondary market sales of cryptocurrency are not investment contracts.  And so, somehow, Crypto.com has reached the precipice. If it wins the first “ripeness” issue and is allowed to bring its case, little stands in its way. Its arguments on the merits are strong, and there are few courts more sympathetic to those arguments than E.D.Tex. From there it would go to the Fifth Circuit, the court the SEC fears the most. And then, just maybe, the Supreme Court, where it would have a sympathetic panel and one of the most experienced appellate attorneys in the country to make its case.  I don’t know how this case will turn out, but pay attention. If it wins, Crypto.com could change the game.

The action followed growing buzz about a planned Litecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal by Canary Capital Group. Investors are excited, since this ETF may provide a more direct method for investing in Litecoin, allowing both individual and institutional participants to access the market. Related Reading: Analysts On Bitcoin: 2024 US Election Could Steer The Crypto’s Future The S-1 registration statement for the proposed ETF was filed on October 15, requesting permission from US regulators. Numerous individuals regard this as a transformative development. Approval might help legitimize Litecoin and facilitate further institutional investment. ‘Canary Capital plots Litecoin ETF’ – @Blockworks_ https://t.co/ypLW4NDYBa — Litecoin (@litecoin) October 17, 2024 Analytical Optimism Meanwhile, Litecoin’s future prospects are bullish among cryptocurrency analysts. While it has lagged recently, being some 80% below its all-time peak of $413.65 reached in May 2021, several analysts argue that the ETF might initiate a new bull cycle. Analyst 28 Crypto believes this ETF, combined with a suitable technical setup on the LTC/USD monthly chart, leads to a large jump in price. Actually, the chart shows that for many years, the LTC has traded within the upward channel while often being a signal for a possible break-out. 28 Crypto hints that, from the current price perspective, a price upwards of $7,000 could well be within striking distance with long-term projections even going well to the vaunted $10,000 level. #Litecoin $LTC Target: $7000 – $10.000 pic.twitter.com/uNCkM9WmWA — 28 Crypto (@NumberOfWealth) October 16, 2024 He posits that the price may approach the June resistance level of approximately $88, presenting a robust entry opportunity for investors. Litecoin: Traders Strategize For Profits The excitement extends beyond analysts. The open interest in the Litecoin futures market has surged to its highest point in three months, amounting to $258.94 million as of October 16. This surge signifies that traders are preparing for additional price rises, demonstrating robust bullish momentum in the market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Jumps Over 16% In The Last Week — More Gains To Come? Despite concerns like Litecoin’s ETF’s regulatory issues, sentiment is positive. According to ETF specialist James Seyffart, Litecoin has regulatory similarities to Bitcoin but may face liquidity issues in the US futures market and policy changes. On the other hand, Steven McClurg, Canary’s CEO, shows hope in LTC’s dependability and uses inside the crypto ecosystem. Approved, this ETF might make LTC as the third cryptocurrency with an ETF despite its somewhat small market value of $5 billion.

42373558,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYlloArn,1729271375,"The New Blockchain Trilemma Is Here, and It’s Not About Technology","The original blockchain trilemma claimed that blockchain users were always going to have to choose between decentralization, scalability, and security. At best, they could have two out of three. The new trilemma is about products, customers, and regulatory approval. Again, pick any two.  When it came to the technology trilemma, at least in the case of Ethereum, the network was long seen as having strong decentralization and robust security, but seriously constrained when it came to capacity. Today, while the trade-offs between these different priorities have never gone away, blockchains themselves have advanced so enormously that in all three areas, most users consider them to be “good enough.”  For many, Ethereum’s transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) and launch of layer 2 networks, is seen as a transition point from a time when trade-offs between these options had big impacts. Ethereum continues to offer solid security and decentralization as a base layer, but the many layer 2 networks available, also offer massive scalability.  The shift into this new trilemma was triggered earlier this year by the nearly simultaneous approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. and the start of the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) which came into effect in Europe. Between these two landmark events and a host of other countries implementing regulatory regimes for digital assets, a fundamental shift is underway in the market.  For many of the biggest companies in the world of digital assets, they possess products and customers, but lack regulatory approval. More than 70% of crypto assets and trading is done offshore, and many of the crypto-native firms cut back their efforts to get licensed in big markets during the recent downturn. As a result, these firms have an existing customer base and quite a few digital asset offerings but lack regulatory approvals to move their businesses onshore and chase new revenues.  A second set group of firms we see a lot of, are digital-asset natives in regulated markets. They have products and regulatory approvals but no customers. These firms have focused on creating digital assets in a regulated environment. They were ahead of their traditional financial peers and have had approvals for their products, but no legacy customer base with whom to sell them.  Finally, you have the biggest and most mature financial institutions. Banks have enormous customer bases and mature regulatory compliance processes, but usually no digital assets to offer.  Like the technical trilemma, there is no perfect solution for matching the entities and creating the perfect union that offers complete regulatory approval, an enormous range of products and a giant customer base. There are several obstacles that stand in the way of that outcome.  First and foremost, the biggest obstacle to offering everything to everyone are the regulators themselves, and with good reason. Over and over again, in my conversations with regulators, they make a clear distinction between the kinds of offerings they believe are suitable and safe for mass market customers, and those that are ready for sophisticated investors. Crypto and digital assets are high risk, they are volatile and not such a good idea for people who are living paycheck to paycheck.  The second big obstacle is the cultures of all these different entities. Even the most legitimate, well-audited and well-run offshore crypto native is an entirely different beast from the world’s big banks. These are the people who went ahead and started companies even when many of their friends and family told them crypto was a scam. They definitely aren’t going to work well in a big bank culture.  In the end, my own expectation is that, like the technical trilemma, the market will reach a level of maturity for all types of customers and offerings that will be “good enough” for most. Those with an appetite for risk will be able to find it inside a regulated ecosystem, but just not with the most conservative traditional financial entities and individual users will find a curated, lower-risk window into the world of digital assets.

42373549,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYlloA6T,1729269779,What to Expect Over the Coming Week in Crypto: Scroll Enters the Frame,"Layer-2 network Scroll is expected to be the main focus of traders next week as it rolls out its native SCR token airdrop.  Memecoins may also make a comeback after a significant rally in major crypto assets like BTC, ETH and SOL.  Gaming firm Moonveil and communications platform Huddle01 will also host token sales.  As the crypto market teeters back into euphoric territory following a rally to three-month highs, several investors are focusing on Scroll, a hyped layer-2 network that will release its native governance token next week.  Scroll has around $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) and has been running a points farm since September 2023. Those that have been actively using the protocol since that date have accrued ""marks"" which can be converted to the Scroll token on Oct. 22.  The distribution of said token has been met with disappointment from users, who have complained about how just 7% of the supply has been allocated for the airdrop next week whilst Binance Launchpool users will receive 5.5% of the supply.  The skepticism continued this week as X user Andrew 10 GWEI revealed how Scroll's founder wallet had more than 1 million marks and that several Scroll-affiliated wallets had inflated balanced. Comparisons have been made to ZKsync, which faced criticism over its top-heavy top allocation.  Aside from early tokenomics teething issues, Scroll plans to be the ""turtle that wins the Ethereum scaling race"" with a layer-2 network that is focused on efficiency, security and being cost-effective, as the headline of an April 2023 CoinDesk story put it.  Scroll was selected by Donald Trump-affiliated project World Liberty Financial to be the layer-2 blockchain of choice, with a planned deployment along with its debut on Ethereum. (Although as chronicled by CoinDesk this week, initial demand for the project's new tokens has proven to be minimal relative to the overall amount allocated to a public sale, and at $13 million so far has not even come close to meeting a $30 million reserve needed to cover expenses.)  Scroll was also selected by restaking firm Ether.fi for its upcoming cash card.  The company has raised a total of $83 million over three separate funding rounds that included investment from the likes of Polychain Capital and Bain Capital Ventures.  Best of the rest  According to Icodrops, next week will also feature the launch of Moonveil, a blockchain gaming company that raised $11 million across two rounds and will raise further capital via a token offering on Oct. 22.  A total of 200 million tokens will be up for sale for the company which is planning to launch a gaming-focused layer-2 blockchain.  Hundreds of memecoins are also expected to hit the wires over the weekend as investors speculate whether another boom could take place after the likes of BTC, ETH and SOL rose significantly this week. Traders typically diversify profits into more speculative bets following a rally in major assets.  BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes tweeted about GOAT, a token that was apparently launched solely through the use of artificial intelligence.  A notable mention also goes to Huddle01, a communications platform backed by Stani Kulechov and LongHash Ventures. It will host a node sale round on Oct. 29.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | AIRDROP | TOKEN SALE,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/18/what-to-expect-over-the-coming-week-in-crypto-scroll-enters-the-frame,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90e63d0c32a106a77ade466d062ad2e7f6f72ef8-1898x1068.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analysts and investors closely monitor the next steps, searching for signs of a continued rally or a potential retrace from higher supply levels. While the excitement is palpable, there is caution as traders prepare for possible resistance. Related Reading: Strong Buy Signal For DogWifHat (WIF) – Key Indicator Hints At Rally To $4 Top analyst Daan shared a technical analysis highlighting that Bitcoin has broken out of an accumulation channel, suppressing the price. According to Daan, this breakout above the $68,000 resistance level signals a potential for further upside as Bitcoin moves into uncharted territory. The next few days will determine whether BTC can maintain its momentum or will face a healthy pullback from these higher levels. With euphoria clashing with fear of a correction, investors are keen to see whether Bitcoin can continue its upward trajectory or if the market will see a pause in the rally. Bitcoin Break Out: New ATH Next? The crypto market is optimistic, as Bitcoin and most altcoins have surged from yearly lows to yearly highs in just a few weeks. Analysts are now speculating that this could be the start of something big—a rally that could propel prices to new highs and deliver massive gains to investors. Despite the excitement, there is also a lingering fear of an impending correction. Historically, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain momentum above supply near $70,000, often facing strong rejections that lead to sharp declines. However, top crypto analyst and investor Daan recently shared a technical analysis on X, explaining why this recent breakout might differ. According to Daan, Bitcoin has finally broken out of a 7-month accumulation pattern that had kept prices down, signaling a significant shift in market dynamics. Furthermore, BTC has managed to break well above the Daily 200 moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), key technical indicators that had previously caused resistance since the summer. Related Reading: Cardano Bullish Pattern Suggests A Breakout – Can ADA Reach $0.54? With the short-to-mid timeframe trend firmly up, Daan believes this bullish outlook may suggest that Bitcoin could avoid another rejection near $70,000. Instead, BTC might be gearing up for a powerful surge, with investors eyeing new all-time highs in the coming weeks. BTC Technical Analysis Since Monday, Bitcoin has tested a crucial supply zone following a strong 9% surge. The price is trading well above the Daily 200 moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), signaling strength and maintaining bullish momentum with no immediate signs of a retrace. This indicates buyers remain in control for now, with a potential push to break above the psychological $70,000 level. However, there’s still a risk that Bitcoin could fail to break and hold the $70,000 mark, which is critical for bulls to maintain upward momentum. A rejection at this level could signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially leading to profit-taking and consolidation. Historically, such moments of euphoria in the market often end with a discouraging move that cools down excitement, and a healthy retrace is possible. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs See $1.6B Inflows This Week – Is BTC Reaching A New ATH Soon? Should BTC experience a pullback, it’s likely to find strong support at the daily 200 MA around $63,304. This level has acted as a key indicator of support in previous uptrends. It could provide a solid foundation for the next leg up if the price corrects before resuming its bullish trajectory.

Analyst Mark Palmer argued the value of the company's bitcoin holdings and its software business will continue to increase.  He also believes that the company's high stock price is justified as it provides more value than just holding massive amounts of bitcoin.  Bears on MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) high stock price thanks to its perky valuation compared to the amount of its bitcoin {{BTC}} holdings are overlooking the company’s “unique” shareholder value, investment banking firm Benchmark said in a research report on Friday.  “We believe the ability of MSTR to generate compounding yield on its bitcoin holdings, using what management describes as “intelligent leverage,” differentiates its stock from alternative means of gaining exposure to bitcoin such as spot bitcoin ETFs,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer wrote.  Already bullish on the stock, Palmer reiterated his buy rating and lifted his price target to $245 from $215. Alongside a rise in the price of bitcoin to $68,400, MSTR shares are higher by 6.6% Friday to $206.19.  Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the stock of self-described Bitcoin Development Company currently trade at a 2.4X premium to the value of its bitcoin holdings, with some traders thusly believing that holding the equity instead of BTC itself (or the spot ETFs) is a bad move.  MicroStrategy’s net asset value (NAV) is calculated by dividing MSTR's market capitalization by the value of its bitcoin stack. The NAV premium recently touched a new high of 2.5 times its bitcoin holdings, with a company market cap north of $41 billion against bitcoin holdings of around $17 billion.  Benchmark believes MicroStrategy’s business model justifies the premium to NAV and that traders should focus on the company’s BTC Yield. Introduced by Saylor and team earlier this year, Bitcoin Yield tracks the effectiveness of bitcoin investments by measuring the percentage change over time of the ratio between MSTR’s bitcoin holdings and its fully diluted share count. The Bitcoin Yield stood at 17.8% through September 19 compared to 1.8% and 7.3% in 2022 and 2023, respectively, according to Benchmark’s data.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/18/microstrategys-nav-premium-shouldnt-be-feared-says-benchmark-raising-price-target-to-245,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/224315b7c03251382f07d6718a11af32fba3674f-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373569,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYlloBd7,1729264201,"Bitcoin Isn't at a Record Like Gold and S&P 500, but an Overlooked Catalyst Suggests a Coming Change","Gold has made another all-time high, climbing through $2,700 per ounce, as has the S&P 500, which rose above 5,870 on Thursday.  While bitcoin is up 15% from the October low and appears set to rechallenge the $70,000 level, it remains about 8% below its record high recorded seven months ago.  A fresh weakening trend in the Japanese yen bodes well for risk assets going forward.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} 8% rally this week has, outperformed gold and the S&P 500, but the cryptocurrency is still below its all-time high, while the yellow metal and benchmark U.S. stock index each climbed to new records.  At $2,718, gold is up 32% year-to-date and on its way to its best annual performance since 2010, when it rose 38%. The S&P 500, meanwhile, is ahead about 23% for 2024. Though not joining in the fun of new records after what's now a seven-month period of sideways-to-lower prices, bitcoin remains higher by over 50% year-to-date.  Why no new record for bitcoin?  Perhaps the chief reason for bitcoin's sluggish action since putting in a record high above $73,700 all the way back in March is ""too far, too fast."" At that point, the price of the globe's largest crypto was up nearly five-fold from 14 months earlier, including almost a doubling in just the first 10 weeks of 2024.  Getting into more detail, there was also plenty of forced sell pressure over the summer when the German government moved to market its large stash of seized bitcoin and the Mt Gox trustee began returning tokens to their owners.  There's also the fact that bitcoin trades 24/7 and is thus subject to a lot more leverage and volatility than other assets. This in turn can lead to a lot more liquidation cascades, pushing the price below fair value.  Read more: Bitcoin Jumps to Just Shy of $68K Before Quick Plunge Lower  The significant amount of distribution that took place over the summer months, which put downward pressure on the bitcoin price, is shown by the deep red coloring.  Looking ahead though, there appear to be signs of accumulation from many cohorts. So-called shrimps – those with less than one bitcoin – and whales – those holding between 1,000 and 10,000 tokens – have been accumulators for the past month, denoted by the deep blue coloring, according to Glassnode data.  Outlook: all-time highs on the horizon  With further rate cuts from Western central banks coming, the rise in the polls of pro-crypto GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump and the big pickup of flows into spot bitcoin ETPs, the case for a new record seems clear.  One overlooked positive catalyst, though, might be the renewed weakening trend in the Japanese yen.  Japan Friday released fresh data showing headline inflation year-over-year at 2.5%, marking the lowest reading since April and 0.5% softer than the previous month. Core inflation also declined sizably. The news could be a signal that the Bank of Japan might refrain from any further rate hikes.  Recall that in early August, a tiny BOJ rate hike sent the yen soaring and global markets – bitcoin among them – crashing for a period of a few days. The yen, however, peaked in mid-September at about 140 to the U.S. dollar and has been weakening since. Following the inflation news Friday, it weakened to 150 to the greenback, its weakest level since that early August panic.  ""Japan has no inflation problem and little urgency to tighten,"" said Bob Elliott, CIO at Unlimited Funds. He noted that services inflation has fallen to roughly zero in recent months, while Japan's GDP has been negative for 2024.  To conceptualize the weakening move in the Japanese yen (JPY), it can be compared against bitcoin and gold and to other major currencies such as the U.S. dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), British pound (GBP), Canadian dollar (CAD) and Australian dollar (AUD).  In the past five years, bitcoin is up over 1,000% against the Yen, but far less against other currencies. Similar action is seen in gold, which is higher by 150% versus the yen, and just 80% to 90% against the other major currencies.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/18/bitcoin-isnt-at-a-record-like-gold-and-sp-500-but-an-overlooked-catalyst-suggests-a-coming-change,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9dcf20160071d4dbba863134d9a3873c3a740a4-4104x2308.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While Drewski’s post reignited the conversation, the $1,000 price target is far from new, as it has been a goal shared by many XRP investors for years. Bold $1,000 Price Target For XRP Drewski’s comment on XRP echoes the entire cryptocurrency investor community. Particularly, it can be inferred that the investor is confident that the combined strength of the Ripple community can trigger a historic price surge for XRP. Related Reading: BTC Held On Exchanges Hits Lowest Point In 5 Five Years, Here’s What It Means For Bitcoin Price Interestingly, the bullish price target for XRP is primarily driven by sentiment rather than technical analysis. However, XRP is no stranger to very bullish price targets when viewed through the lens of technical analysis. For instance, renowned crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO has provided analysis indicating that XRP could be on a trajectory towards $27. In another technical analysis, the analyst highlighted the possibility of XRP surging further to $99. How Feasible Is The $1,000 Price Target? While the prediction is exciting, there are skeptics who question whether XRP can realistically reach $1,000. Critics highlight the enormous market capitalization required to reach this level. For XRP to hit the $1,000 mark, it would either need to achieve a market cap of $99.99 trillion based on its current total supply or burn most of its supply. Many critics are also quick to point out the regulatory uncertainties surrounding XRP and Ripple. If you ask many crypto participants, many will call XRP dead, considering the crypto has performed poorly than many expected in recent years. Currently, XRP is trading at a fraction of the $1,000 target. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.5515. The cryptocurrency has been down by 0.7% in the past 24 hours but remains up by 2.5% in a seven-day timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $95,000? Here’s What Needs To Happen First To reach the price target, XRP would need to go on a 1,800x price surge from the current level, which would make many of its holders multi-millionaires. Therefore, the prospect of such a move has kept the dream of a $1,000 price target alive for many XRP enthusiasts. A more realistic dream would see XRP break above the $1 mark before reaching the double-digit threshold at $10. For XRP to go on a steady rally, it would need to continue growing in adoption in the traditional financial system. Furthermore, a final resolution to the ongoing Ripple-SEC lawsuit is needed, as achieving regulatory clarity could bring the dream of a $1,000 XRP closer to reality than ever before.

34851494,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24341,1729261401,Will Ethereum Reduce Minimum Staking?,"The Ethereum community has been abuzz with talk of reducing Ethereum’s staking threshold from 32 ETH to 1 ETH, to lower the barrier for individuals to become validators and earn staking rewards, as well as enhance decentralisation. This change could increase the number of validators, strengthening the network’s security but also introduce challenges like managing a higher volume of validator signatures. To address this, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin suggested implementing “single-slot finality” to speed up block confirmations. The proposal could reduce the reliance on liquid staking platforms like Lido which have been criticised for being a vector of centralisation, and allow more individuals to stake independently, potentially reshaping Ethereum’s staking landscape. What Impact Would Reducing Minimum Staking Have on the Ecosystem? Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has proposed reducing the validator staking threshold from 32 ETH to 1 ETH, a move that would significantly lower the barrier to entry for those looking to run their own validator. Currently, the 32 ETH requirement is seen as prohibitive for many individual stakers, preventing smaller participants from directly securing the Ethereum network. Reducing this threshold to 1 ETH could democratise the staking process, enabling a wider range of users to participate as validators and decentralising the network further. The proposal aligns with Ethereum’s long-term vision of inclusivity, allowing more individuals to contribute to its security. The potential impacts of this reduction are wide-ranging. By allowing more participants to stake, the Ethereum network would likely see an increase in the number of validators, which could strengthen the decentralisation of the system. However, this influx of validators could also introduce technical challenges, such as the need to efficiently handle a much larger volume of validator signatures. To address these concerns, Buterin has proposed the implementation of “ single-slot finality ,” which would speed up block confirmations from the current 15 minutes to just 12 seconds. This mechanism could help maintain network performance despite the increased validator count, ensuring Ethereum remains both secure and efficient. If the proposals are implemented it could have an impact on liquid staking protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool , who aggregate smaller amounts of ETH from users who cannot meet the 32 ETH threshold, allowing them to participate in staking. If the staking requirement drops to 1 ETH, the demand for such services may decrease, as individual users would have more control and the ability to run their own validators. This could shift the balance of power in Ethereum staking. Since the minimum 32 ETH requirement was introduced, it has favoured a few platforms, resulting in a concentration of staked ETH, and potentially weakened Ethereum’s core principle of decentralisation. If a single platform or entity amasses too much influence over the network’s validators, it could undermine the security and governance of Ethereum, making it more vulnerable to censorship or coordinated attacks. The rise of these platforms, while beneficial for liquidity and accessibility, raises critical questions about how to preserve Ethereum’s decentralised qualities while scaling its staking infrastructure. Currently, Lido dominates staking with almost 30 percent market share . It is also possible to stake less than 32 ETH today on centralised exchanges such as Bitfinex , by pooling your ETH holdings with other ETH holders to earn staking rewards. This removes the technical hurdles associated with setting up and running a validator node, and allows you to stake less than the required 32 ETH, giving you the option to stake as little or as much as you prefer. Find out how here . This proposal could influence Ethereum’s future roadmap by encouraging more widespread participation in staking and fostering a more decentralised network. It also signals a continued emphasis on making Ethereum more accessible and user-friendly, both for stakers and developers. While there are still challenges to overcome in implementing this change, such as managing increased network overhead, the long-term benefits could be significant. Ethereum would not only strengthen its security but also align more closely with its cypherpunk philosophy of decentralisation and inclusivity, ensuring that it remains resilient and adaptable in a rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. A Fork in the Road For Ethereum’s Possible Future Roadmap Ethereum’s future roadmap is centred around enhancing scalability, decentralisation, and security, with several major paths being considered to improve its Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol. Another significant proposal involves the implementation of “single-slot finality.” Currently, it takes about 15 minutes to finalise a block on Ethereum, which can be a drawback for users seeking faster transaction confirmations. Single-slot finality aims to reduce this time to just a few seconds, improving the user experience and making Ethereum more competitive with performance-focused Layer 1 blockchains. The challenge lies in ensuring that this acceleration does not compromise Ethereum’s security, particularly the high level of “economic finality,” which is a key safeguard against potential 51% attacks. Balancing faster finality with the network’s decentralisation and security goals is crucial for any future protocol updates. There are also discussions about Orbit-style solutions and two-tiered staking systems. An Orbit mechanism would introduce a committee-based approach to validator selection, randomly choosing a subset of validators to participate in each finalisation round. This could reduce overhead by limiting the number of validators required to finalise each block while maintaining economic finality. A two-tiered staking system, on the other hand, would involve different roles for validators with varying deposit sizes. Higher-tier validators would handle finality duties, while lower-tier stakers might be delegated more minor tasks or be allowed to participate in other staking activities, offering a more flexible staking model. Both of these approaches could help Ethereum scale more efficiently, but they also raise concerns about potential centralization if higher-tier validators accumulate too much power. Ethereum’s roadmap is also exploring quantum resistance and 51% attack recovery mechanisms. As quantum computing technology advances, it poses a long-term threat to current cryptographic methods, including the BLS signature aggregation that Ethereum relies on for its PoS protocol. Preparing Ethereum for a quantum-resistant future is a proactive step toward ensuring its long-term security. Similarly, developing automated recovery systems for potential 51% attacks could reduce reliance on social consensus in times of crisis, making Ethereum more resilient. Overall, Ethereum’s roadmap reflects a commitment to both near-term optimisations and long-term strategic planning, ensuring the network’s continued growth and security in an evolving technological landscape. How Would Reducing the Staking Amount Impact Ethereum’s Potential Roadmap? Reducing the staking amount on Ethereum from 32 ETH to 1 ETH would have a profound impact on the network’s future roadmap, particularly in terms of accessibility, decentralisation, and scalability. At current market prices , the 32 ETH staking amount is equivalent to approximately $84,000. Lowering the threshold to 1 ETH would democratise staking, allowing a much broader range of participants to contribute directly to Ethereum’s security. Liquid staking platforms might also then need to adapt their business models. This change could potentially introduce competition among staking services, pushing them to innovate with new offerings like enhanced liquidity or better user experience. Lowering the staking threshold could also have implications for Ethereum’s technical roadmap, particularly in terms of network scalability and finality. With more validators joining the network, there would be an increase in the number of participants verifying transactions and securing the network. While this would enhance decentralisation, it could also raise concerns about operational complexity and finality times. Ethereum’s consensus mechanism would need to handle the influx of validators without overburdening nodes or slowing down block finalisation. Solutions like “single-slot finality,” which aims to reduce block finalisation times would become even more important in this context to ensure that the network remains efficient as the number of validators grows. Finally, the reduction of the staking amount would shape Ethereum’s long-term evolution by making staking more accessible and appealing to a wider range of users. This move would likely increase participation from retail investors and smaller ETH holders, broadening the base of network participants and enhancing Ethereum’s resilience against centralization. However, it would also place greater pressure on Ethereum’s governance and technical infrastructure to manage this influx effectively. To balance these changes, the Ethereum community might need to explore new governance models, staking tiers, or protocol upgrades that ensure the network remains secure and efficient. Reducing the staking threshold would be a pivotal shift in Ethereum’s roadmap, enhancing its accessibility and decentralisation but also introducing new challenges in maintaining scalability and security.

34848689,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648651,1729256422,WIF Price Approaches $2.89 Resistance As Bulls Regain Control,"Dogwifhat (WIF) has resumed its upward trajectory, with the price approaching the key $2.89 level as bulls take back control. After a period of consolidation, renewed buying pressure has fueled the meme coin’s rise, signaling that momentum is once again favoring the bulls. With increased buying pressure and positive market sentiment, WIF is showing signs of an impending uptrend. As WIF edges closer to this significant resistance level, this article will assess its recent price action, highlighting the bulls’ regained strength. Through an analysis of key technical indicators and market dynamics, this piece seeks to evaluate whether the current bullish momentum is strong enough to push WIF past the $2.89 resistance, signaling the potential for further upward movement. Market Sentiment Shifts: Bulls Take Charge As Buying Pressure Increases WIF has consistently held its position above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, signaling upside movement. Recently, the asset experienced a rebound from the $2.45 support level, further enhancing positive market sentiment. If the price remains above the SMA, it could establish a solid foundation for another upward movement toward the $2.89 resistance level. This combination of support and bullish arrows suggests that WIF is well-positioned for more gains in the near term. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates renewed upside potential, with the RSI climbing to 49% after previously dipping to 41% suggesting that buying momentum is gaining strength as the market shifts from a bearish phase toward a more neutral stance. Related Reading: WIF Bulls Push Hard Toward $2.1 Resistance Amid Market Optimism Additionally, the daily chart shows that WIF is facing significant upward pressure, as evidenced by attempts to form bullish candlesticks. This positive trend is further supported by the asset’s position above the critical $2.20 support level and the 100-day SMA. As WIF continues on this path, it strengthens the optimistic sentiment in the market, paving the way for additional gains as it nears the $2.89 mark. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is currently at 58%, having recently recovered from a dip to the 56% threshold. Should the RSI continue to climb, it could signal further strength in WIF’s price action. Furthermore, a sustained move above the 60% mark could enhance the likelihood of continued upbeat momentum and potential breakouts, reinforcing the positive outlook for the asset. Key Resistance At $2.89: Can WIF Break Through? WIF’s price could reach the $2.89 resistance level if it demonstrates sustained bullish pressure, bolstered by strong buying volume and positive market sentiment. A successful breakout above $2.89 may pave the way for further gains, possibly leading to new highs and increasing investor interest. Related Reading: WIF Bulls In Control As RSI Signals Strong Upside Potential Conversely, if WIF fails to break through this level, it could lead to a pullback, causing the price to drop toward the $2.25 support level. Should it fall below this mark, the meme coin may continue its decline, potentially targeting the $1.50 level and beyond.

The bank is also exploring a treasury and liquidity management solution with Ant Financial.  Singapore-based DBS Bank has announced a new suite of banking services, integrating tokenization and smart contract-enabled capabilities for institutional clients.  The DBS Token Services will offer instant, real-time payment settlement through the bank’s Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible permissioned blockchain, its core payment engine and multiple industry payment infrastructures.  Permissioned blockchains, which allow the creator more control over who can access a blockchain, are often used by businesses and governments instead of open, permissionless blockchains. DBS said its use would allow it to harness the benefits of blockchain technology while adhering to compliance standards.  “To capture the massive shift of human and corporate activity to on-demand digital services, companies and public sector entities are reimagining their operating models and customer engagement strategies. A new generation of ‘always-on’ banking services is essential to support this shift and transformation.” said Lim Soon Chong, Group Head of Global Transaction Services at DBS Bank.  Read more: Tokenization: Real World Assets, Real World Benefits  He added that DBS Token Services would allow companies and public sector entities to optimize liquidity management and streamline operational workflows, as well as strengthen business resilience and unlock new opportunities for end-customer or end-user engagement.  “It marks a significant step forward in transaction banking and demonstrates how established financial institutions can leverage blockchain technology to deliver new ground-breaking features and experiences,” he added.  The announcement follows several moves by the bank to further integrate blockchain solutions into its offering, though many of its projects remain in the pilot stage. It recently launched Treasury Tokens - a treasury and liquidity management solution, as part of a pilot with Ant International.  It also ran a pilot with Enterprise Singapore and Singapore Fintech Association into conditional payments, which it believes opens up new possibilities for smart contracts to improve payment workflows.  Additionally, DBS plans to explore using smart contracts for digital voucher programs, including as part of the second phase of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s e-HKD Pilot Program. Users who complete green actions will receive new digital vouchers, which can be used to purchase green products and services at designated small and medium-sized merchants.

42373562,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYlloBCp,1729253311,First Mover Americas: BTC Flirts With $68K Amid ETF Inflows,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,056.00 +1%  Bitcoin (BTC): $67,818.38 +1.35%  Ether (ETH): $2,625.15 +0.85%  S&P 500: 5,841.47 -0.02%  Gold: $2,709.71 +0.59%  Nikkei 225: 38,981.75 +0.18%  Top Stories  Bitcoin made another attempt to establish a foothold above $68,000 early in the European morning before pulling back and trading around $67,800. BTC has gained about 1.35% in the last 24 hours, outperforming the broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, which is just under 0.8% higher. Bitcoin has also risen nearly 9% this week, according to CoinDesk Indices, amidst strong uptake for spot BTC ETFs. The U.S.-listed funds have seen inflows of $1.86 billion since Monday, which, even with one day remaining, is their highest tally since the second week of March, according to data compiled by SoSoValue.  Globally, bitcoin ETPs have enjoyed their best week since July, according to bold.report. ETPs have registered a cumulative inflow of 25,675 BTC ($1.74 billion) in the last seven days, as investors worldwide have scrambled to gain exposure to bitcoin amidst its latest rally. The U.S.-listed ETFs' inflows of nearly $1.9 billion are the equivalent of 21,450 BTC. To put this into perspective, the bitcoin ETF investors have purchased around 48 days of mined supply, as roughly 450 BTC get mined daily. These spot ETFs have now taken over $20 billion in net inflows since inception, an impressive feat as it took Gold ETFs about five years to reach the same number, according to Bloomberg's ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas.  Dogecoin jumped late U.S. hours Thursday as entrepreneur Elon Musk further revealed plans for his proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” at a Pennsylvania town hall. The event encouraged early voting in the crucial state where Republicans and Democrats are in lockheads. DOGE has risen over 9% to over 13 cents for the first time since late July, beating the broader market and bitcoin’s 1% rise in the past 24 hours. It extended one-week gains to over 22%, the highest among all major tokens. Musk has emerged as a key backer of Republican Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in the past months. He has donated over $75 million to the American PAC since July and is scheduled for several campaign appearances in Pennsylvania this month.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily Bitcoin transaction fees in USD and BTC's price.  Transaction fees spiked to $67,300 Thursday, the highest single-day tally since Aug. 22.  Renewed bullish price action in Bitcoin-based memecoins likely catalyzed the spike in transaction fees, according to IntoTheBlock.

The next altcoin season could go anywhere from 10x to the amazing 500x, experts believe. Two important charts by renowned market analyst Kevin Cage on XRP’s relationship with Bitcoin’s supremacy in past bull markets form the basis of this favorable prediction. The Last 2 Times $XRP Pumped Was during the previous 2 Alt Seasons when #Bitcoin was drawing higher highs first. 2017: Over 500X (over 300x with Monthly Candle Bodies) 2021: 10x (During Lawsuit & Exchange Delistings) Will history rhyme or will the future be different?… pic.twitter.com/V8nb9yh8qR — Kevin Cage (@Kevin_Cage_) October 16, 2024 Recently, financial analyst Gary Cardone generated enthusiasm within the XRP community with a cryptic tweet suggesting a possible “launch” for the cryptocurrency. Historically, Bitcoin’s market dominance has significantly influenced the performance of altcoins, such as XRP. When Bitcoin’s dominance declines, altcoins frequently experience significant increases. Related Reading: WLFI Token Launch, Backed By Trump, Falls Flat On $300 Million Fundraising Target We are waiting….I confirmed w/ authorities they are ready for you, this was the message; XRP- LAUNCH PAD IS: Green……. Proceed with launch codes….. Repeat: Launch pad is green lite for XRP. XRP may Launch. General Barnaby Anushopium https://t.co/JB2BMQDoHs — Gary Cardone (@GaryCardone) October 15, 2024 This trend was apparent in previous altcoin seasons, as XRP flourished when Bitcoin’s market dominance diminished. Proponents such as Zach Rector assert that XRP is poised for a substantial breakout, bolstering the belief that the token’s future may be promising. Historical Performance Indicates Potential Cage emphasizes two critical epochs in XRP’s history. During the 2017 bull market, XRP surged more than 500-fold, increasing from $0.006 to $3.50 by early 2018. This increase occurred as Bitcoin’s dominance decreased from 95.91% to 35.46%. Altcoins including XRP surged significantly when Bitcoin fell, grabbing the chance to shine. Though delisted from multiple exchanges and facing legal challenges from the US SEC, XRP had an incredible 10x gain in value during the 2021 bull run. It increased from $0.18 to $1.96 with a corresponding decrease in Bitcoin’s supremacy, which fell from 73.51% to 39.54%. These historical examples demonstrate a distinct trend: XRP typically excels when Bitcoin declines. Altcoin: Market Dynamics Currently, Bitcoin’s dominance is approximately 58%, having recently increased. Should its dominance begin to wane once more, according to previous cycles, XRP may be poised for another substantial price surge. A tenfold rise is possible, which would push XRP above $5. This shows that altcoin seasons are still a big reason for the token’s price changes. Even though these predictions are getting a lot of attention, it’s still not clear how much XRP will rise. Things like the present lawsuits against Ripple could change how the market works. The SEC’s recent appeal in its case against Ripple makes things more complicated. It makes the legal fight last longer and makes investors less sure of what will happen. Related Reading: Dogecoin Jumps Over 16% In The Last Week — More Gains To Come? Community Discourse And Speculation The XRP community is full of speculations. Cardone’s tweet made while using military imagery indicated some kind of upcoming development for XRP.

We noticed this month that publicly traded bitcoin miners, who now control a record ~30% of the global hashrate, have significantly increased their bitcoin holdings. A growing list of public companies around the world are duplicating the corporate treasury strategy pioneered by MicroStrategy. Our findings support the conclusion that institutional flows are leading price, not following it. We believe bitcoin is set for a breakout due to increased BTC holdings by miners, rising corporate treasury investments, and higher Bitcoin ETP flows. Please note that VanEck has exposure to bitcoin. Some Takeaways for Mid-September – Mid-October: Our recent check of Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) technicals and fundamentals has strengthened our conviction that bitcoin is poised for a high-volatility catch-up rally. Despite its recently subdued volatility compared to other asset classes, mounting signs - including political momentum, increasing institutional adoption, and bullish on-chain and market data - indicate the likelihood of an impending breakout. We noticed this month that publicly traded bitcoin miners, who now control a record ~30% of the global hashrate, have significantly increased their bitcoin ((BTC)) holdings. The U.S.-listed miners in our coverage added 2% to their BTC treasuries MoM in September, continuing their 11% MoM holding/buying spree from August despite increased prices. These additions coincide with an increasing number of BTC that has been untouched for 6+ months (currently in the 95% percentile vs. all-time history). A growing list of public companies around the world are duplicating the corporate treasury strategy pioneered by MicroStrategy (+194% YTD). Corporate holdings of BTC rose 8% last month, led by MicroStrategy (MSTR) and German and Japanese firms. We did some quantitative analysis on the predictive power between ETP flows and bitcoin price. Our findings support the conclusion that institutional flows are leading price, not following it. Bitcoin’s Price Action Bitcoin’s price rose by 11% month-over-month (MoM), continuing to form higher highs and higher lows since the market bottomed in August. Still, volatility remains subdued relative to other FX pairs and investable asset classes. Recent positive poll numbers for Trump appear to be leading Bitcoin’s latest rally, the impact of which can be seen in a decline in the % of coins that have moved in the last 6 months: now just 17%, in the third percentile of activity. We believe this “buy and hold” activity highlights BTC’s growing appeal as a macro-hedge, particularly among institutional investors. Indeed, BitcoinTreasuries.net data shows that public companies have increased their bitcoin holdings by ~8% since September 11th. Notable examples include Samara Asset Group’s ( CAGPF ) recently announced plans to offer up to €30m in senior bonds to purchase bitcoin. Japanese real estate manager Metaplanet ( MTPLF ), Inc. rallied over 15% on October 15th after the firm announced adding another 1 billion yen worth of bitcoin, bringing their total BTC treasury to ~855 BTC (~$56 million .D). Metaplanet shares are up 675% in the last 12 months. Moreover, exchange-traded products (ETPs) and other funds hit record-high aggregate ownership at nearly 1.1 million bitcoins in late September, approaching the same ownership level as Satoshi Nakamoto. Lastly, in a sign the U.S. market may be opening up to banks, BNY ( BNY ), the largest custodian bank in the world, received an SAB 121 exemption from the SEC to custody crypto assets for digital asset ETPs, sidestepping the onerous requirement to list crypto as balance sheet liabilities. While the exception is limited, it potentially paves the way for the future of bank-custodied digital assets, pending discussions of “additional use cases” with the SEC. Market Sentiment: The percentage of Bitcoin addresses in profit grew by 6% over the past 30 days, with nearly nine out of ten addresses sitting on gains today. The unrealized profit/loss ratio also improved by 6%, signaling a more positive outlook compared to the summer months, despite currently sitting at a neutral 0.48 on the 7-day average. Both metrics, at the 71st and 67th percentiles of their all-time history, suggest significant room for upside potential as the next leg of the bull market develops after eight months of choppy price action. Bitcoin dominance: Bitcoin's dominance ticked up one point to 57%, maintaining highs not seen since April 2021 and further solidifying its status as the primary store of value within the crypto market. As detailed in last month’s report , we think Bitcoin is uniquely positioned among crypto assets to thrive in either a pro-crypto or crypto-hostile administration. We believe ongoing hostility from U.S. regulators like Gary Gensler toward non-Bitcoin digital assets could disrupt the usual pattern of Bitcoin dominance peaking around election time. While sectors like DeFi, L1s, L2s, and GameFi have seen short-term outperformance, Bitcoin has maintained its gains more consistently, as shown in this month’s Chart of the Month. A more crypto-friendly Trump administration could potentially reverse this trend by introducing clearer regulations and de-risking investments in the more participatory proof-of-stake crypto assets. Regional trading: The long-term geographical trend of Asia selling bitcoin to the U.S. and Europe remains intact, with traders during U.S. and EU hours driving the strongest price performance, +2% and +4%, respectively, in the last month. Regional Trading MoM Change (%) YoY Change (%) Asia Hours Price Change MoM ($) 0 1 U.S. Hours Price Change MoM ($) 2 5 EU Hours Price Change MoM ($) 4 4 Source: Glassnode, as of 10/14/24. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Funding Rates: Over the past month, the 7-day moving average of annualized bitcoin futures funding rates rose by 8%, reflecting increased risk appetite as prices recovered. At the 49th percentile of its historical range, this indicates relatively neutral sentiment - especially given bitcoin’s historically bullish market bias - suggesting room for increased leverage among aggressive traders. Bitcoin ETPs and Price Correlation One of the standout findings this month is the growing influence of bitcoin ETPs on the market, marking a pivotal shift in bitcoin’s market structure. U.S. bitcoin ETP net inflows totaled $19.4 billion through October 14th. The correlation between weekly ETP inflows and bitcoin's returns has shown a strong positive relationship, with an R² value of 0.3422. This trend became even stronger when analyzing weeks from July 1st – September 22nd, which yielded an R² value of 0.5791. Interestingly, we also found that daily ETP flows also showed some modest predictive power for BTC price changes in the following after-hours trading period (R² = .0527) , demonstrating a spillover of US “TradFi” market momentum into the 24/7/365 crypto markets. U.S. Bitcoin ETP Inflows Help Drive Price Discovery Source: Farside, Glassnode, YTD through September 30th. These findings suggest that institutional participation via ETPs is playing an increasingly important role in bitcoin's price discovery process. When examining the reverse relationship, we found a less statistically significant impact. Bitcoin’s after-hours returns (price movements overnight, on weekends, and on holidays) showed some predictive power for U.S. bitcoin ETP inflows on the following trading day (R² = 0.1261), suggestive of institutional momentum-chasing. We found this relationship strengthened on a weekly basis, with one week’s bitcoin returns explaining the variance of the following week’s U.S. bitcoin ETP inflows with an R² value of 0.3422. However, when filtering for July 1st– September 22nd, we found that there was no statistically significant relationship between bitcoin’s returns in each given week and U.S. bitcoin ETP flows in the following week. These findings underscore the idea that institutional flows are leading price, not following it. Source: Farside, Glassnode, YTD through September 30th.

Transaction activity is historically high at the 97th percentile. Ordinals inscriptions: Daily inscriptions (e.g. Bitcoin NFTs) transactions fell 63% MoM, a significant pullback from the Ordinal ecosystem’s surge in activity in early September. Total transfer volume: Total transfer volume declined by 30% MoM. However, this metric is somewhat overstated, as last month’s transfer volumes peaked at highs not seen since April. Transfer volumes remain up 103% YoY and sit at their historical 85th percentile. Average transaction fees: USD-denominated transaction fees increased by 257% to an average of $2.26 MoM, driven recently by increased Runes transactions . Runes are a type of fungible token standard on Bitcoin, primarily used for meme trading. While up 43% YoY in USD terms, fees are down 38% YoY in bitcoin ((BTC)) terms, pointing to the necessity of bitcoin’s continued price appreciation for healthy miner economics. Bitcoin’s so-called security budget, comprised of Bitcoin’s (deflating) mining rewards and network transaction fees, remains a topic of concern for the network’s long-term health. However, having weathered the four-year halving cycle reset this April, it is a relatively distant concern. September Bitcoin Mined, Bought, and Sold by Pure-Play Miners Source: Company Filings, VanEck Research as of 10/14/2024. Bitcoin Miners Total daily BTC miner revenues: Driven by higher prices and increased transaction fees from network activity, miner revenues reached ~$29.9 million, a 19% MoM increase. Transfer volume from miners to exchanges ((USD)): After reaching YTD lows in early September, Bitcoin transfers from miners to exchanges increased by 50% MoM. Curiously, however, the U.S.-listed miners that we cover appeared to increase their holdings. This parallels the trend of European and American traders accumulating Bitcoin from Asian sellers. Among the 12 U.S.-listed miners in our coverage, the 9 maintaining Bitcoin treasuries have continued to increase their aggregate BTC holdings, driven primarily by the pure-play miners we noted in our AI/HPC research : MARA ( MARA ), RIOT ( RIOT ), and CLSK ( CLSK ). While other miners like CORZ ( CORZ ) and CIFR ( CIFR ) have divested from their BTC treasuries to fund AI/HPC buildouts, these pure-play miners are emulating MicroStrategy’s leveraged Bitcoin approach by increasing their BTC positions. MARA particularly stood out for continuing its months-long Bitcoin buying spree, financed by ~$244 million in convertible note proceeds announced in August. Publicly traded miners’ hashrate dominance: Publicly traded Bitcoin miners now control a record ~30% of the global hashrate. This concentration means that any further pivots by these listed miners toward AI/HPC could have significant implications for global hashrate and difficulty. Divesting from mining reduces the global hash rate and mining difficulty, making the sector more profitable for remaining players, all else being equal. Rise of the pivotoors: As of October 14th, CORZ (+278%) leads our covered Bitcoin miners YTD. In fact, only miners that have announced AI/HPC pivots are positive on the year: CORZ, WULF (+97%), IREN (+26%), and CIFR (+5%). As referenced above, in late September, CIFR announced selling over one-third of its bitcoin treasury to finance the acquisition of its new West Texas Barber Lake site. Similarly, in early October, WULF ( WULF ) sold its 25% equity interest in the Nautilus Cryptomine joint venture to fuel further the expansion of its AI/HPC and self-mining efforts at its Lake Mariner facility. Better late than never: In a fireside chat with Bernstein on October 3rd, RIOT’s CEO Jason Les discussed the potential suitability of its Rockdale and Corsicana sites for AI/HPC. Relative to its peers, RIOT has been late in joining the AI/HPC discussion. Justifiably, Mr. Les explained that Riot does not want to create unnecessary hype nor invest in AI/HPC infrastructure without a customer. With MARA indicating in March its strategic initiative to diversify its operations with its MARA 2PIC700 immersion cooling system, CLSK remains perhaps the only U.S.-listed miner in our coverage unequivocally committed to remaining a “pure-play” bitcoin miner - at least for now. Echoing RIOT’s reluctance to create undue hype, CLSK’s CEO Zach Bradford expressed skepticism about bitcoin miners’ ability to compete for high-quality revenues, stating that despite CLSK owning two buildings that could meet AI/HPC data center criteria, they are choosing to remain focused on efficient bitcoin mining. As of October 14th, RIOT is the best-performing mining stock over the last month, +25%.

Notes: Net unrealized profit/loss ratio (NUPL) can be calculated by subtracting the realized market cap from the market cap and dividing the result by the market cap.

Citi said a Harris win and a divided Congress would lead to more uncertainty for the digital assets space.  The bank cut its Coinbase price target to $275 from $345, while maintaining its buy rating on the stock.  A Republican sweep in the upcoming U.S. election would be the most bullish result for both Coinbase (COIN) and the wider crypto market, while a Harris victory and a divided Congress would likely lead to more uncertainty for the digital assets sector, Citi (C) said in a research report on Wednesday.  ""The Trump/Vance ticket has publicly endorsed digital asset reform, Republican control of the Senate would be important for passing bills like FIT21 and confirming pro-crypto agency leaders,"" analysts led by Peter Christiansen wrote, adding that ""the pace of digital asset reform would likely move faster with both chambers of Congress aligned.""  Still, a GOP victory in the Senate and a Democrat win in the House would still be a bullish outcome for Coinbase and crypto markets, the report said. The U.S. election will be held on Nov. 5 and results will be declared on Nov. 8.  Citi noted that the existing House Financial Services Sub Committee is manned by several Democrats who are strongly against crypto. However, they would ""likely still be outweighed by a combined Democrat and Republican pro-crypto contingent.""  A Harris victory and a Republican Congress would be an uncertain outcome for crypto markets, as she is yet to detail her crypto policy goals, the bank said, and a Democrat administration would likely keep many of the current agency heads to avoid potential challenges with Senate confirmation.  Citi said the result that would lead to the most uncertainty for digital assets would be a Harris win and a divided Congress. It would pose possible Senate confirmation challenges and Coinbase investors would likely be less hopeful that any potential crypto legislation would gain enough support from the Senate.  Citi has a buy rating on Coinbase shares. It cut its price target to $275 from $345. The stock was 2.7% higher at $209.65 in early trading Friday.

42373565,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYlloBI5,1729247021,DOGE/BTC Bear Trend Intact After Dogecoin's 24% Weekly Gain,"DOGE/BTC lingers at the depth of a prolonged bear market, undercutting any notion of speculative frenzy.  The ratio's present price pattern resembles late 2020.  Dogecoin's (DOGE), the world's leading meme cryptocurrency by market value, has surged 24% in one week, outpacing gains in other major tokens, including industry leader bitcoin.  However, the broader downtrend in the doge-bitcoin (DOGE/BTC) ratio, which began in May 2021, persists, according to charting platform TradingView. The ratio represents DOGE's BTC-denominated valuation.  The key takeaway is that it is probably too early to worry about a 2021-like speculative bubble, and the ongoing bullish trend in bitcoin {{BTC}} and the wider crypto market may have plenty of steam left.  Back in early 2021, DOGE consistently outperformed BTC, resulting in a nearly 1,000% uptrend in the DOGE-BTC ratio in the first four months. The broader market crashed in May 2021, with BTC falling from $60,000 to as low as $30,000.  The perception of dogecoin as a highly speculative asset with no intrinsic value means its price surges are often taken as a warning sign of impending market instability. DOGE's latest 24% surge in USD terms comes as long-time crypto fan Elon Musk proposed a government agency named D.O.G.E., triggering speculation of a bigger role for cryptocurrency under the potential Trump administration.  The chart shows that DOGE/BTC is looking to recover from the depths of the bear market identified by the trendline connecting highs reached in May 2021 and November 2022.  This week, it has bounced over 10%, defending the horizontal support from early February lows amid a bullish shift in momentum signaled by the MACD histogram. The histogram is a moving average-based technical indicator widely tracked to gauge trend changes and strength.  A potential move past the trendline would mean the bear market has ended, opening doors for a notable DOGE outperformance ahead.  A replay of 2020-21?  The present price structure resembles 2020, when the DOGE/BTC ratio was stuck in a prolonged downtrend.  The ratio eventually topped the bear market trendline in December as the MACD flipped bullish, entering the so-called speculative frenzy mode.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/18/dogebtc-bear-trend-intact-after-dogecoins-24-weekly-gain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af5533562893e00a029eaace0996b96eacade301-1905x1072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34843765,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648656,1729245653,"Bitcoin Price To $95,000? Here’s What Needs To Happen First","The Bitcoin price has now broken above the $68,000 mark amid a run of a 12% price increase in the past seven days. However, analysis says the Bitcoin price will not stop this surge anytime soon. According to a detailed analysis posted on TradingView, a well-known crypto analyst has shared insights suggesting that Bitcoin is on track to climb even higher to reach an ambitious target of $95,000, but USDT.D needs to break below the lower boundary of a triangle first. Interesting Take On Bitcoin Price Outlook The analyst in question, known as TheSignalyst, takes an unconventional approach to analyzing Bitcoin’s price movement by relying on a lesser-known but intriguing metric. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analysts Turn Bullish As ‘Something Big Is Coming’, Here’s What According to TheSignalyst, the USDT.D chart, which tracks the dominance of the stablecoin Tether (USDT) in the cryptocurrency market, efficiently tracks the overall sentiment of the crypto market. Though not widely used by mainstream analysts, this metric has proven useful in predicting market tops, bottoms, and future price action. According to the USDT.D chart, the USDT dominance has been playing out a descending triangle pattern since the first days of August. Since this period, the USDT dominance has ranged between 6.5% and 5.34% of the total crypto market cap up until the time of writing. As the analyst noted, as long as USDT dominance remains within the descending triangle, Bitcoin’s price is likely to continue consolidating in a range. However, TheSignalyst adds that for Bitcoin to truly enter a bullish run, the USDT dominance needs to break downward. Specifically, it would have to fall below the lower boundary of the descending triangle and drop beneath 5.2% of the total crypto market cap. What Does This Mean For The BTC Price? As the largest stablecoin, the USDT dominance can reveal a lot about the prevailing sentiment among crypto traders. High periods of USDT dominance suggest investors are pulling out of riskier assets and parking their funds in stablecoins, while a decline in the USDT dominance suggests inflows into cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: BTC Held On Exchanges Hits Lowest Point In 5 Five Years, Here’s What It Means For Bitcoin Price In the case of TheSignalyst’s analysis, the USDT dominance breaking below 5.2% would signal reduced reliance on the stablecoin and a renewed appetite for riskier assets, paving the way for Bitcoin to embark on a more aggressive upward trajectory. According to the analyst, if this scenario unfolds, it could enable Bitcoin’s price to break past the $70,300 mark in the weekly timeframe. This level sits just above a descending trendline that has been stopping Bitcoin’s momentum since April, and a successful breakout could confirm the start of a much larger rally. In the case of such a breakout, the analyst suggests a strong surge towards the $100,000 price level. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $68,100 and is about 47% away from this six-figure target.

34841187,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648634,1729240245,Bitcoin Poised For Minimum 60% Rally As 3 Critical Signs Align,"Henrik Zeberg, a macroeconomist known for his expertise in business cycles, has pinpointed an upcoming rally of at least 60% for the Bitcoin price in his latest technical analysis. The seasoned analyst has identified a pattern across three critical technical indicators that have historically signaled major upward price movements when all aligned. Bitcoin Price Set For Next Bull Run Zeberg highlights the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is traditionally used to assess whether an asset is overbought or oversold. Currently, the RSI is positioned above the 50 mark, which often indicates growing bullish momentum. More importantly, the RSI has broken above a descending trendline that previously capped momentum, a shift that typically precedes robust price increases. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Move Imminent: 7 Key Reasons Behind The Bullish Outlook Alongside the RSI, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is showing a bullish crossover. This event occurs when the faster moving MACD line, depicted in blue, crosses above the slower signal line, shown in red. This crossover is a traditional signal used by traders to confirm a potential reversal from bearish to bullish market conditions. Zeberg’s emphasis on this crossover is consistent with its recognized predictive value in signaling the start of a bullish phase. The third indicator, the Relative Vigor Index (RVGI), is lesser-known but no less critical. This indicator is also experiencing a bullish crossover, marked by the green line overtaking the red line. The RVGI measures the vigor of price movements and its crossover is indicative of a strong bullish undertone. The chart provided by Zeberg is annotated with several instances where these conditions were met in the past, each followed by significant price rallies. These include surges of +318% in 2019, +824% in 2020, +70% in late 2021, +64% in January 2023, and +176% in the second half of 2023, indicating not just minor increases but substantial bull runs. The historical context adds weight to the current setup, suggesting that a similar outcome may be on the horizon. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bull Rally Hinges On $57K Support Level—Here’s Why It Matters Zeberg has pointed out that each time Bitcoin has shown this configuration of technical indicators, it has led to rallies of no less than 60%.” Every time we have seen a confirmation of the three following indicators, BTC has rallied and by minimum 60%,” Zeberg writes. His confidence in this pattern is evident as he describes the potential for what he calls a “Blow-Off Top,” a term that suggests an intense and rapid increase in price. As reported by NewsBTC, Zeberg forecasts that a US recession is unavoidable, yet it will be preceded by a significant surge in financial markets, which includes a major rally in Bitcoin, potentially reaching between $115,000 and $120,000 in a “Blow-Off Top” scenario.

34838670,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648614,1729234810,Analysts On Bitcoin: 2024 US Election Could Steer The Crypto’s Future,"Yet another reason that has given the rocket fuel to the price of Bitcoin is the rapidly approaching US presidential elections. Several analysts are keenly observing whether political dynamics will take their toll on the cryptocurrency in the near future with the election date nearing. Related Reading: Dogecoin Jumps Over 16% In The Last Week — More Gains To Come? QCP Capital believes that the result of the presidential election might have significant influence on the trajectory of Bitcoin. This should be relayed in the current trading patterns as options contracts associated with the election are trading at a 10% premium, thus indicating increased market sensitivity towards political developments. Who Is More Advantageous For Bitcoin: Trump Or Harris? Former President Donald Trump has revealed that he now supports cryptocurrencies. This is a very significant U-turn since he used to outright bash the existence of cryptocurrencies. In his latest speech, he pushed how much it was essential to embrace digital currencies, stating that crypto was moving out of the United States because nobody appreciates it. Source: QCP Capital He advises the creation of a national Bitcoin stockpile and prevent the Federal Reserve from launching a digital currency. This approach aims to attract supporters and contributors of cryptocurrencies, hence maybe raising the value of Bitcoin should he be successful. As for Vice President Kamala Harris, she hasn’t said much about it yet, but she is talking to some in the crypto community. That the campaign would seek to obtain crypto votes signifies that she is willing to reconsider her stance on digital currencies. Although she may not fully embrace crypto as Trump has, her willingness to discuss the matter could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment in the event that she were to win. Market Predictions And Reactions Currently, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $67,685, and some analysts anticipate that it will shortly surpass its all-time high of nearly $74,000. Bitcoin ETFs have registered a decent amount of inflows in the last few weeks, which may have been a major factor to the recent increase in Bitcoin prices. The Bitcoin ETFs experienced a $457 million inflow on October 16, which culminated in four consecutive days of advances. This favorable momentum implies that institutional investors are becoming more optimistic about the potential of Bitcoin. Related Reading: SUI Price Hits All-Time High – But Questions About Valuation Remain Nevertheless, there is still a degree of uncertainty regarding the crypto market’s future, as the policies of both candidates could result in varying outcomes. Harris’s changing stance throws open possibilities of speculations on the future regulations that are likely to be made and Trump’s pro-crypto stand being seen as a positive for Bitcoin. The Bitcoin market capitalization, which is still a figure of $1.3 trillion, according to some analysts, may make it less susceptible to high volatility by any verdict. Meanwhile, QCP Capital believes this US presidential election will affect Bitcoin. Political changes are already affecting election options contracts, which trade at a 10% premium. As traders await policy changes from any candidate, QCP expects the election to influence Bitcoin’s future.

34837002,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648591,1729231252,Massive Bitcoin Move Imminent: 7 Key Reasons Behind The Bullish Outlook,"Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is showing signs of a potential breakout, according to analyst Miles Deutscher. Historically, October has been a strong month for BTC, and recent trends suggest that the cryptocurrency may be on the verge of a substantial upward movement. Over the past week alone, the Bitcoin price has surged more than 13%, approaching its all-time high of $73,700 set in March of this year. Increased Global Liquidity And Low Supply Deutscher notes that Bitcoin has been consolidating above critical support levels for much of the year, positioning it for potential expansion. Despite numerous failed breakouts in the past, which have led to a general distrust among traders, the analyst believes that this environment may create an opportunity for a significant price increase. Many retail investors remain sidelined, as indicated by Bitcoin’s current ranking on Coinbase and declining Google search interest in the cryptocurrency. This may suggests that the market force known as fear of missing out (FOMO), has yet to set in among investors. Related Reading: BNB Rejection At Key Level Hints At A Potential Price Correction The macroeconomic backdrop also supports Bitcoin’s potential for further gains. Increased global liquidity—now at its highest level in three years—has historically influenced Bitcoin’s price positively. Deutscher also emphasizes that as equity markets begin to recover, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, often correlating closely with the S&P 500. Additionally, Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has reached an all-time low, suggesting that a supply squeeze may be imminent. The analyst contends that this trend indicates that fewer BTC are available for trading, which could drive prices higher as demand increases. October To April As ‘Boom Period’ For Bitcoin Deutscher also emphasized in his analysis the upcoming US presidential election, which he believes adds another layer of complexity to the market. The analyst speculates that a victory for former President Donald Trump could lead to favorable market reactions, with Bitcoin potentially positioned as “a pillar of US financial stability.” The Republican candidate has made a number of promises, the most notable being plans to make Bitcoin a reserve asset for the country, with the aim of using it to reduce the $35 trillion national debt, further supported by pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis. Related Reading: Solana’s Dogwifhat Meme Coin Flashes Buy Signal At $2.5, Is It Time To Jump In? Seasonality also plays a role, according to the analyst. Deutscher explains that the period from October to April 2025 is traditionally seen as a “boom period” for cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin needs to break out of its current range—potentially facing resistance around $70,000—Deutscher believes this breakout is likely, especially given the substantial short interest in Bitcoin. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $66,940, down 1.5% in the 24 hour time frame, as it has encountered significant resistance at the $68,000 level, preventing it from tackling the biggest resistance yet at $70,000.

42373564,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYlloBNL,1729230519,Dogecoin Jumps 7% as Musk Touts D.O.G.E at Trump’s Pennsylvania Campaign,"Elon Musk discussed plans for a ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (D.O.G.E), leading to a 7% surge in Dogecoin's price, pushing it over 13 cents for the first time since late July.  Musk's backing of Trump and the potential political implications of D.O.G.E. have sparked increased interest and speculative trading in DOGE.  Dogecoin (DOGE) jumped late U.S. hours Thursday as entrepreneur Elon Musk further revealed plans for his proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” at a Pennslyvania town hall.  The event encouraged early voting in the crucial state where Republicans and Democrats are in lockheads.  DOGE rose 7% to over 13 cents for the first time since late July, beating the broader market and bitcoin’s 1% rise in the past 24 hours. It extended one-week gains to over 22%, the highest among all major tokens.  DOGE-denoted open interest - or the number of unsettled futures bets – spiked to over 5 billion tokens in a sign of forthcoming volatility. Higher open interest alongside higher prices suggests that the market trend is strong.  Musk has emerged as a key backer of Republican Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in the past months. He has donated over $75 million to the American PAC since July and is scheduled for several campaign appearances in Pennsylvania this month.  The proposed department, abbreviated as D.O.G.E, will seek to make government spending of taxpayer money more efficient while streamlining departments that handle spending.  Musk suggested the proposed department could be run similarly to a corporate company at the Thursday town hall, with incentives for performers and penalties for those who fail to deliver results.  The expectation among crypto traders is that a Trump victory could lead to more chatter of “DOGE,” fueling retail attention and interest in dogecoin in the future if D.O.G.E actually becomes a part of the government.  “Elon Musk is simply going to meme the 'Department of Government Efficiency' into existence - with validation from Trump!,” influential X trader @theunipcs said in a Wednesday post, as reported. “And you can expect him to continue to aggressively bullpost the concept until it gets created.”  @theunipcs added in a Friday post that DOGE’s popularity could also fuel a rise in floki (FLOKI), a meme ecosystem project initially inspired by the name of Musk’s pet dog.  Musk is a long-time dogecoin supporter and DOGE tends to surge on payments-related developments at any Musk-owned companies, such as X or Tesla.",POSITIVE,DOGE | FLOKI,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | FLOKI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/18/dogecoin-jumps-7-as-musk-touts-doge-at-trumps-pennslyvania-campaign,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c9fb2ad8810d46c2c69d3ea3e1f26dc47d101e8-1024x687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373553,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYlloABj,1729230248,'High-Risk' Crypto Loans Surge to a Two-Year High of $55M on Benqi: IntoTheBlock,"The total amount of crypto-collateralized loans within 5% of their liquidation price is at its highest in over two years on Avalanche's leading decentralized lending platform Benqi, according to IntoTheBlock.  The surge in the so-called high-risk loans indicates potential liquidation cascades and market volatility ahead.  The decentralized lending market on Avalanche is booming, with ""high-risk"" loans on decentralized platform Benqi surging to over two-year highs, sparking concerns of liquidation cascades and volatility.  The total amount of high-risk loans, defined as those within 5% of their liquidation price, rose to $55 million Wednesday, reaching the highest since June 2022, according to data tracked by analytics firm IntoTheBlock.  Crypto traders often draw loans from decentralized lending platforms by locking in collateral in the form of digital assets. The risk here is that if the value of the collateral falls too much, the protocol liquidates the debt by selling off the collateral. A loan within 5% of the liquidation price means if the collateral's price falls by 5%, it will no longer cover the loan, triggering liquidation.  Thus, the surge in these risky loans is noteworthy as it can lead to a liquidation cascade. In this self-reinforced process, a series of liquidations happen quickly, lowering crypto prices. That, in turn, causes further liquidations and increased market turbulence.  ""Large liquidations can impact the collateral value, putting more loans at risk of liquidation, creating a downward price spiral,"" IntoTheBlock said in a market update. ""Rapid market drops may result in insufficient collateral to cover loans, resulting in bad depth and losses to lenders.""  IntoTheBlock added that bad debt can negatively impact market liquidity, making it difficult to trade large orders at stable prices. ""Bad debt can keep lenders from adding new liquidity to prevent potential losses,"" the firm noted.

Very Few Bitcoin Addresses Are Still Underwater In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has shared an update on how the Bitcoin holder’s profitability is currently looking. The analytics firm has made use of on-chain data to determine this. IntoTheBlock has gone through the transaction history of each address on the network to check the average price at which it acquired its coins. Wallets with a cost basis below the current price are assumed to carry some net unrealized profit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Transfers See Massive Spike: Sign Of Profit-Taking? Similarly, addresses of the opposite type are considered to be loss holders. The analytics firm terms the former investors “in the money,” while the latter are “out of the money.” Naturally, the wallets with their average acquisition price equal to the latest spot price of the cryptocurrency would be just breaking even on their investment. They would be said to be “at the money.” Now, here is how the address distribution on the Bitcoin network is like right now across these three categories: As is visible above, around 95% of the existing Bitcoin holders currently have a net profit. About 3% of the remaining are at their break-even level, while the rest 2% are underwater. Thus, the market distribution is currently overwhelmingly skewed towards profit holders. The reason behind this is the recent price rally the asset has gone through. “With 95% of Bitcoin addresses now in profit, market sentiment is booming,” notes IntoTheBlock. “Historically, such levels have signaled strong bullish momentum but can also indicate a potential overextension.” Generally, investors in profit are more likely to sell their coins at any point, so a large amount of them being in the green can raise the chances of a mass selloff occurring with the motive of profit-taking. This is why a high profitability ratio can suggest potential overheated conditions. A huge amount of addresses are in the money right now, so it’s possible that another profit-taking event could happen. It remains to be seen whether demand would be enough to absorb the selling or if a top would take place for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Is Negative Despite $68,000 Rally: What It Means On a more bullish note, the Bitcoin inflows to “accumulation addresses” have spiked recently, as CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn has pointed out in an X post. The accumulation addresses refer to the wallets that have no history of selling on the network. These perennial HODLers have just added a massive 56,700 BTC to their wallets, which could suggest they may be starting another phase of accumulation.

On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5465 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5465 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $0.5550 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5659 swing high to the $0.5398 low. The next key resistance could be $0.5650. A clear move above the $0.5650 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5880 resistance or even $0.5925 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6000. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.550 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.540 level. The next major support is near the $0.5345 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5345 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5280 support in the near term.

The price is trading above $2,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $2,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it clears the $2,650 and $2,680 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Aims For More Upsides Ethereum price remained stable above the $2,550 pivot level like Bitcoin. ETH corrected some gains and tested the $2,550 support level. Recently, it started a fresh increase above the $2,580 and $2,600 resistance levels. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,685 swing high to the $2,538 low. The bulls were able to push the price above the $2,620 resistance zone. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $2,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,650 level. It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,685 swing high to the $2,538 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,685 level. A clear move above the $2,685 resistance might send the price toward the $2,750 resistance. An upside break above the $2,750 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,840 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,880 level or $2,920. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,650 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,600 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $2,570 zone. A clear move below the $2,570 support might push the price toward $2,550. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,480 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,420.

However, despite this, some positive signs may be on the horizon. According to a CryptoQuant analyst, Percival, Ethereum’s open interest has increased significantly, indicating rising investor optimism for a potential rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Are Quietly Accumulating—Is A Major Price Breakout Coming? Potential For Ethereum Rally And Longs Benefit According to the data shared by Percival, Ethereum’s open interest stands at $9.6 billion, marking a 28.57% increase from August, although it is still below the $13 billion recorded in June. The rise in open interest points to expectations of an upward price movement, with many traders positioning themselves for increased demand. Percival noted that several factors, including potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and a growing focus on the future of tokenization on the Ethereum blockchain, may fuel this uptick. This shift could drive more interest toward decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, making Ethereum more attractive for investors looking for long-term gains. Percival also highlighted that Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 61, suggesting that the market is overheated. A “convergence” between open interest and RSI levels indicates that price corrections will likely be short-lived, providing opportunities for traders to position themselves for a market rebound. The analyst estimated that Ethereum may experience a correction of around 7% to 9% before rallying again, favoring long positions as traders await a potential rise in both price and demand. The analyst particularly wrote in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform: The convergence of the highest lows in the RSI suggests a potential for a less pronounced correction, estimated to be between 7% and 9%. This scenario favors long positions, with traders patiently waiting for a market rebound to confirm new highs and higher lows. ETH’s Path To A Bullish Breakout At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,611, down slightly by 0.1% in the past 24 hours. This comes after a strong week where the cryptocurrency saw a 9.3% increase and a nearly 15% rise over the past month. According to another prominent crypto analyst, Ali, Ethereum could be on the verge of a significant rally. In a recent post on X, Ali revealed that Ethereum has recently touched the lower boundary of a channel, a level that has historically led to an average 130% price surge. Related Reading: Crypto Watch: Ethereum Poised for Upside Break! According to Ali, should this pattern continue to hold, Ethereum could potentially climb to $6,000 as long as it maintains its key support level of $2,300. Every bounce off this channel’s lower boundary has historically led to an average 130% price increase for #Ethereum. If this pattern holds, a similar move could push $ETH to $6,000—provided the key $2,300 support level stays intact. pic.twitter.com/CFpLrQWEih — Ali (@ali_charts) October 14, 2024 So far, despite ETH’s market’s volatility, the asset has managed to maintain its price above the critical $2,300 support level, which lends credibility to the theory that a bullish breakout could be on the way.

34830804,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648558,1729216821,"Bitcoin Trades Below Global Prices In South Korea, Erasing Long-Standing ‘Kimchi Premium’ – Here’s Why","Bitcoin (BTC) is trading slightly lower in South Korea compared to the global cryptocurrency markets due to a reverse ‘kimchi premium,’ not seen since October 2023. Reverse ‘Kimchi Premium’ Makes Bitcoin Cheaper In South Korea According to a report by The Korea Times, there is a price differential of more than $500 between Bitcoin’s price in South Korea and global markets. Analysts attribute this to a negative ‘kimchi premium.’ Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Market Shift: Are We Near A Major Sell-Off? For the uninitiated, kimchi premium refers to the price difference where BTC trades at a higher price on South Korean exchanges than on global markets. This premium is driven by local demand, regulatory factors, and capital controls in South Korea, leading to occasional price discrepancies. Currently, the kimchi premium stands at -0.74%, leading to a lower market price for BTC on South Korean exchanges than the rest of the world. Notably, the kimchi premium has been negative since October 15. A positive premium indicates strong demand for the underlying digital asset. In contrast, a negative premium might suggest that investors may be looking to trade on foreign exchanges due to South Korea’s stringent regulations surrounding digital assets. A positive Kimchi Premium is common on South Korean exchanges, which often experience high trading volumes. When BTC briefly crossed $72,000 in March 2024, the kimchi premium surged as high as 10%. The report suggests low domestic investor sentiment is a key factor behind the negative premium. While global crypto trading volumes have surged due to the upcoming US presidential elections and a Chinese stimulus package, sentiment in South Korea remains lukewarm. KP Jang, head of Xangle Research, commented: Korea prohibits foreign and institutional investors from using domestic exchanges, which makes the decline in retail investor demand a more direct factor. Further, the preference for typically riskier altcoins in hopes of extraordinary profits might influence the local South Korean crypto market, driving attention away from BTC and leading to lower trading volumes. That said, analysts expect the negative kimchi premium to be a temporary phenomenon. Jang explained that, historically, such price discrepancies have only persisted for a short period. Will A Regulatory Overhaul Help South Korea? The crypto regulatory framework in the peninsular country is witnessing several changes to streamline digital asset trading and ensure sufficient customer protection mechanisms are in place. Related Reading: South Korean Authorities Investigate Lawmaker Over Alleged Crypto Transfers In 2022, South Korea elected pro-crypto Yoon Suk-Yeol as president. As part of his election campaign, Yoon promised to reduce government interference in crypto markets, calling existing regulations “far from reality and absurd.” In contrast, neighboring Japan has openly embraced digital assets amid evolving crypto regulations. For instance, earlier this year, Japan’s Government Investment Pension Fund (GIPF), with $1.5 trillion in assets, expressed a desire to gain exposure to BTC. BTC trades at $67,559 at press time, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours. When writing, the leading cryptocurrency commands a total market cap of $1.33 trillion.

However, recent analysis suggests that the $57,000 level could be one of the most critical support points for the ongoing bull rally. This insight comes from a CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, who highlighted the role of Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in shaping the market stance. Related Reading: Analyst Says This Bitcoin Price Rally Has A ‘Different Ring To It’, Places Next Target At $109,000 Bitcoin Resilience At The $57,000 Level Spot ETFs have emerged as a major instrument in the Bitcoin ecosystem, offering a regulated entry point for institutional investors. According to Kesmeci, the average cost of Bitcoin Spot ETFs has been a key support level throughout 2024, providing a foundation for the asset’s price stability. This level is pegged at $57,000 and has held firm throughout the year, with only two significant exceptions. The $57,000 price level is significant because of its technical support and the psychological implications for Spot ETF investors. Could the Average $BTC Spot ETF Cost (57K) Be the Most Crucial Support Level in the Bull Rally? “The price of #Bitcoin managed to stay above this level throughout the year, with only two exceptions.” – By @burak_kesmeci Full post 👇https://t.co/troZDKwKNw pic.twitter.com/IWqNJ2L6Kg — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 16, 2024 Bitcoin’s price dipped below this support level twice in 2024. The first instance was in early August, driven by Japan’s market turbulence, and the second in September due to a sharp price correction. Despite these market shocks, Spot ETF investors did not react with panic selling. Kesmeci wrote: Bitcoin Spot ETF investors proved, contrary to the expectations of many, that they are not weak hands. Foundation Set For Positive Move According to the CryptoQuant analyst, these investors demonstrated resilience by holding onto their investments, even when unrealized losses mounted. Their ability to withstand market pressure contrasts with typical behavior in other speculative sectors, where sudden price drops often lead to mass sell-offs. This suggests that Spot ETF investors have grown more comfortable with Bitcoin’s inherent volatility, recognizing its long-term potential. The analyst highlighted that minor outflows during these turbulent periods were not significant enough to disrupt the broader market. Even during Japan’s “carry trade” crisis, where many expected a stronger market correction, the overall sentiment among Spot ETF investors remained calm. In conclusion, Kesmeci noted: As you can see from the chart above, the average cost of Bitcoin Spot ETFs has become perhaps the most crucial support level in the 2024 bull rally. With this long-term perspective, the contribution of Spot ETFs to the Bitcoin rally has laid a solid foundation for the potential developments in the market’s future.

34827539,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=648480,1729209659,"XRP Price Prediction: Analysts Turn Bullish As ‘Something Big Is Coming’, Here’s What","Crypto analysts Amonyx and Egrag Crypto have provided a bullish outlook for the XRP price with “something big” on the horizon. Based on their analysis, the long-awaited price breakout for XRP could soon happen. Something Big Is Coming For XRP Price Crypto analyst Amonyx stated in an X post that something big is coming for the XRP price. His accompanying chart showed that the crypto could enjoy a massive rally to $75. The analyst made this prediction based on XRP replicating a similar run that it enjoyed in the 2017 bull run when its price surged by over 61,000%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $130,000 By January, Here’s The Roadmap The chart showed that XRP consolidated for a year before it broke out and enjoyed that unprecedented rally. In line with this, the analyst highlighted how XRP has been consolidating since then, suggesting another price breakout is imminent. Amonyx has recently been more bullish on the XRP price. Before now, he predicted that the crypto would reach between $50 and $57 at the peak of this bull run. However, his recent prediction offers a more bullish outlook for XRP. Interestingly, he also recently predicted that the crypto could enjoy a “giga pump” to $400. These bullish XRP predictions are believed to be partly because of the recent applications by Bitwise and Canary Capital to offer an XRP ETF. These funds could contribute to a significant rally for XRP since they will attract more institutional investors into the coin’s ecosystem. Therefore, these XRP ETFs will positively impact the XRP price just like the Spot Bitcoin ETFs did for the Bitcoin price. Meanwhile, in the short term, Amonyx also expects that the XRP price could enjoy a significant rally. In a recent X post, he shared an XRP/Bitcoin chart and told XRP holders that a God candle was coming soon. XRP’s Breakout Target To Keep An Eye On Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto highlighted $0.61 and $0.62 as the breakout targets to keep an eye on. He noted that the breakout point is getting lower and added that the XRP has a maximum of 70 days left before it reaches the final pinnacle of the breakout point. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Can Port To $86,600 If It Breaks This Level Egrag Crypto further remarked that he is convinced that the price breakout could happen sooner than expected, within the next 15 to 30 days. According to him, the pressure is building and won’t stay contained for much longer. Indeed, XRP’s consolidation dates way back to the 2021 bull run when it failed to reach a new all-time high (ATH). The $0.60 price level has also proven to be strong resistance for the coin, as it has retested and failed to break above it multiple times since Judge Analisa Torres delivered her final judgment in the Ripple SEC lawsuit in August. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $0.55, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
