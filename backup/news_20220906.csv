There have been some spikes and pullbacks in the price of many. For instance, the beginning of this week saw Bitcoin moving farther from its $20K mark. Bitcoin lost its hold on the $20K mark on September 2, closing the market at $19,969. Since then, the crypto has struggled to remain afloat with little rallies and dips.

The blog pinpointed several alleged inaccuracies in the Acala proposal’s account of the exploit, including errors in the reported number of aUSD mints sent to and traded on KuCoin.  “As a neutral platform, KuCoin has no intention to intervene in the governance of the Acala community, but it has been found that much of the important information related to the CEX in the report and the proposal is inaccurate,” the blog read.  By KuCoin’s account, which cited data from a list of the exchange’s aUSD deposit addresses, hackers sent 8.03 million aUSD, rather than 4.937 million aUSD to KuCoin, and5.3 million aUSD, rather than one million aUSD was traded on the platform.  Neither KuCoin nor Acala has responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment.  In its blog, KuCoin advised Acala to reconsider its community’s proposal given its reliance on possibly inaccurate data. Freezing and burning aUSD tokens – actions the community took after reviewing the data – could cause “ tremendous damage to the Acala community and the price of the aUSD token,” the exchange observed.  “Given the significant difference in the amount of aUSD error mints deemed necessary to re-collateralize, it is suggested that the Acala community reconsider the current proposal together with the Acala Foundation,” the post read.  Read more: Acala Stablecoins Near $1 Peg After Community Burns 1.2B aUSD Minted by Exploiters  Hackers erroneously minted what should have been more than $3 billion worth of aUSD stablecoins in mid-August. Their actions came just before Acala launched its iBTC/aUSD liquidity pool, a crowdsourced collection of smart-contract-locked wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) and Acala’s native, “censorship-resistant” stablecoin designed to reward liquidity providers with acala (ACA), the network’s native token, and interlay (INTR).  Following the attack, the Acala community assembled a trace report to identify the 16 wallet addresses involved in the attack and trace suspicious transactions. The network has since recovered and burned 2.97 billion, or roughly 98%, of the 3.02 billion wrongly minted tokens.

This hard fork is just as important to the Cardano network as it not only improves the experience of developing on the network, it also strengthens the security of the blockchain. September has now been set as the month of the hard fork, and the most recent announcement from IOG shows that the network is almost there. Top Exchanges Getting Ready For Vasil Previously, IOG, the developer behind the Cardano network, had made it known that it needed to reach three different metrics for the hard fork to be completed. These included that at least 75% of all SPOs would have upgraded the final node version, the top 10 decentralized applications (DApps) would have upgraded to Vasil-supported nodes, and lastly, was that at least 25 top exchanges which represented 80% of all ADA liquidity would be ready for the upgrade.

Even a Newly Banished Issuer Was OK With It,"While some market participants were initially shocked that the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume ended its support of a slew of stablecoins, others are praising the move – including the issuer of the largest stablecoin that’s getting ousted.  Binance announced Monday that USD coin (USDC), Paxos dollar (USDP) and trueUSD (TUSD) will no longer be traded at the exchange, and deposits will automatically be converted to Binance USD (BUSD) – the exchange’s own token – starting in late September.  The decision touches a core part of the crypto ecosystem. Traders use stablecoins – cryptocurrencies whose prices are anchored to an asset such as the U.S. dollar – as a bridge between traditional government-issued (fiat) currencies and blockchain-traded digital assets. The combined market capitalization of stablecoins mushroomed to $160 billion from less than $20 billion two years ago.  In the last 24 hours, four-fifths of all bitcoin (BTC) and three-fifths of all ether (ETH) traded on exchanges were done against U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, according to data compiled by CryptoCompare.  Read more: What's the Point of Stablecoins? Understanding Why They Exist  With some $20 billion in average daily volume over the past month, the Binance exchange is roughly eight times larger than its nearest competitor, FTX, in terms of transactions, according to Coinranking. Thus, its announcement stirred some controversy at first, interpreted as the exchange’s attempt to use its heft to prop up its own $19 billion stablecoin and simultaneously favoring Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin, worth $67 billion, over its challenger, the $52 billion USDC.  While it seems counterintuitive, Jeremy Allaire, chief executive officer of Circle, the firm that issues USD coin, tweeted that the “change will likely lead to more USDC flowing to Binance.”  As crypto traders don’t really use BUSD outside of Binance itself, “this will likely benefit USDC usage as the preferred cross CEX [centralized exchange] and DEX [decentralized exchange] stablecoin rail,” Allaire added. “With consolidated dollar books, it will now be easier and more attractive to move USDC to and from Binance for trading core markets.”  A Binance spokesperson said the firm’s goal with reducing the number of tokens trading at the exchange was to concentrate stablecoin liquidity. The decision was agreed upon with Circle and other third parties in advance.  The co-founder of Wintermute, a major crypto trading firm, agreed that USDC will benefit. “This is positive for USDC (and TUSD and others),” Evgeny Gaevoy tweeted. “It’s not USDC ‘delisting’, it’s another big step towards tether (USDT) losing ground to U.S.-native stablecoins.”  For the users’ own good?  Binance’s move to slash trading pairs carries advantages for its customers, too.  Paxos Trust Co., which issues both USDP and Binance’s newly favored BUSD, claimed there were security improvements for users.  “This is a positive development for the safety of Binance’s customers,” Rich Teo, co-founder and CEO of Paxos Asia, told CoinDesk, citing that BUSD is under the supervision of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and its backing reserves are kept in a “bankruptcy remote trust which offers greater consumer protections.”  Crypto trading with USDC, TUSD and USDP “have relatively little volume” compared with both USDT or BUSD on Binance, Clara Medalie, research director at crypto market research firm Kaiko, pointed out in a tweet.  Low trading volumes mean that trading with these stablecoins carries significantly higher spreads, essentially incurring hidden costs for users.  “While controversial, this move will likely improve price discovery and overall liquidity on Binance,” Medalie said. “Downsides (for some) are further centralization of market activity on Binance and growing dominance of Binance-issued products.”  Even though the verdict on Binance’s move seemed mostly positive, Circle criticized the exchange’s approach to unilaterally convert existing customer assets.  “While optimizing dollar liquidity on the world’s largest exchange may carry benefits, the paradigm does raise potential market conduct questions,” a Circle spokesperson told CoinDesk.",NEUTRAL,USDT | USDC,EXCHANGE | TRADING | USDT | BNB | USDC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/06/binance-ditched-a-bunch-of-stablecoins-even-a-newly-banished-issuer-was-ok-with-it,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42394835,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVoES,1662496889,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Takes Late Dive Below $19K, Ether Falls as Merge Countdown Begins","Price Action  Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) took divergent paths on Tuesday, as BTC traded down while ETH rose early in the day ahead of the much-anticipated transition of the Ethereum blockchain to a proof-of-stake protocol from proof-of-work. ETH prices traded down as the day progressed  Bitcoin started off the post-Labor Day week by trading down 4.5% on moderate trading volume. The largest cryptocurrency sank below $19,000, falling more sharply late in the afternoon New York time.  Ether, by comparison, was 2% lower on greater-than-average volume, as Ethereum moves closer to its conversion to a faster, more energy efficient proof-of-stake protocol. Monday’s successful activation of the Bellatrix upgrade is one of the final steps before completion of the Merge, a software update that is expected to be completed between Sept 13-15.  Bitcoin: The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently declined by more than 4% as investors remained wary of riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Ethereum will likely hold center stage for weeks, as crypto investors await the results of the Merge, which was first announced in December 2020. With the move, minting new ether tokens will consume a lot less energy than before.  The potential also exists for ETH to become a deflationary currency post-Merge, which would result in lower overall ETH supply. A lower supply of ETH is likely to cause higher valuations for current holders of ETH, something that is driving ether higher now.  Economic Calendar: Growth in the U.S. services sector was stronger than expected in August, as a reading from the Institute of Supply Management came in at 56.9, compared with expectations of 55.. Figures above 50 represent an expansion, while figures below 50 imply contraction.  U.S. Equities: Traditional financial markets were down, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%, 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively. Investors appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach with stocks.  Commodities: Crude oil prices fell 0.1%, while natural gas prices fell 8.5%. Copper futures rose 1.3%, and the price of gold, a safe-haven asset, declined 0.7%  Altcoins were down, with polkadot (DOT) and solana (SOL) decreasing 6% and 4%, while uniswap declined 9%  Latest Prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $18,843 −4.6%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,576 −0.7%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,906.28 −0.5%      ●Gold: $1,712 per troy ounce +NaN%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.34% +0.1      Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  ETH continues to outpace bitcoin.  ETH prices warranted attention Tuesday and will continue to do so in coming days, given the Ethereum Merge. The price for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is roughly flat since Aug. 29.  Derivatives markets imply bullish sentiment for ETH, however, as the call/put ratio for the open interest in ETH options is 3.81. A call option represents the right but not the obligation to purchase an asset at a specific price. A put option represents the right but not the obligation to sell an asset at a specific price.  Open interest indicates the number of call and put options contracts held by investors, and the ratio between the two highlights which is held more. A call put ratio above one can signal that participants are bullish.  ETH’s 3.81 call/put ratio shows that investors now hold more than three times the number of options to buy as they do options to sell, suggesting a high degree of optimism. The highest level of call open interest for ETH exists at the $3,000 strike price, representing a nearly 100% premium to the current price.  Plotting ETH prices relative to BTC shows that the ETH/BTC currency pair has risen 52% since July 22 to 8 cents from 5 cents. The relative strength index (RSI) indicator is 69, which in traditional circumstances implies an overbought condition. ETH’s RSI for the ETH/USD pair is 47.92, which is slightly below the traditionally neutral mark of 50.  The RSI is a technical indicator that measures price momentum. Values above 70 imply overbought/overvalued conditions, while values under 30 imply oversold/undervalued conditions.  Because the ETH/USD pair trades at significantly higher volume than the ETH/BTC pair, its neutral RSI implies additional upside for ETH prices, particularly when viewed in conjunction with derivatives data.

For most of this year, Fed policy makers have been sanguine toward markets like stocks, preparing traders in advance (called “forward guidance”) for upcoming changes to monetary policy. But that seems to be in the past. In July, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that central bankers would stop practicing forward guidance.  “It’s clear the Fed wants to see tighter financial conditions, which include lower stock prices,” Brian Overby, senior markets strategist at Ally, wrote in a note.  And that probably means crypto, too, because crypto prices have been strongly correlated with equities. That’s likely unwelcomed news for crypto investors, who’ve already suffered deep losses.  Bitcoin is already down over 57% for the year to date, according to CoinDesk data, grappling with a broader crypto asset sell-off fueled by industry bankruptcies and a struggling global macroeconomic landscape.  The U.S. central bank has two mandates: price stability and maximum employment. Right now, prices aren’t stable, with inflation running well above the Fed’s 2% goal. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is still low and employers are adding over 300,000 jobs per month. That’s great news for job seekers but, perversely, something that could fuel inflation, raising pressure on the Fed to take even stronger action.That spells potential trouble for markets like stocks and crypto.  “The Fed wants to create a reverse wealth effect and get people that own assets to rethink some of their purchase habits and maybe slow demand,” said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research.  “It’s a dangerous game,” he added. “You want the market to go down, but you gotta be careful when that starts to happen because if you get everybody running for the hills because they’re going to be the enemy of the market, you could turn it into a rout.”  Even though U.S. gross domestic product has contracted for two straight quarters, the economy seems to be in good enough shape to withstand continued aggressive rate hikes. Further signs of weakness, though, will test the Fed’s resolve and force policy makers to evaluate how much pain they want to cause in markets.  “It's very possible that [the central bankers] could very well cave once they're faced with some really bad employment numbers, but they haven't been so far,” Bianco said. “I don’t think they will but I completely understand that argument.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/06/the-fed-wants-you-to-lose-money-in-stocks-and-probably-crypto-too,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ce7de52394bd9de1617df3f8dd098918e584caa-2935x2202.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Read more: The Final Countdown to the Ethereum Merge Has Officially Begun  Ethereum is aiming to be “a global settlement layer,” Preston Van Loon, an Ethereum protocol developer at software development company Prysmatic Labs, told CoinDesk TV on Tuesday.  “That means that everything can settle on Ethereum, even bitcoin [BTC], in the far future,” Van Loon said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”  Read more: The Final Countdown to the Ethereum Merge Has Officially Begun  Ethereum’s Bellatrix upgrade, the last hard fork of the network before the Merge can take place, was implemented Tuesday at approximately 7:35 a.m. (ET).  “What it means is the proof-of-work side of Ethereum is now ready to merge with the proof-of-stake side,” Van Loon said.  One of the biggest obstacles to Ethereum's expansion has been the environmental impact of the proof-of-work mechanism, according to VanLoon. “We see this as a barrier for global adoption,” he said.  Read more: Bitcoin's Price May Crash After Ethereum's Merge, Researcher Says  With the switch to proof-of-stake, Ethereum’s energy consumption should be cut by 99.95%. That could increase the appeal of Ethereum to institutions that have concerns with the blockchain’s environmental impact. Smaller computers requiring less power would be able to use the Ethereum network.  “With proof-of-stake, you can be a block producer and a participant in the consensus of Ethereum with something as small as a laptop, or a Raspberry Pi, in some instances,” Van Loon said. Raspberry Pis are small single-board computers that can be used to run a local Ethereum node.  Van Loon added that the beauty of proof-of-stake means ""you simply have something at stake, saying I'm behaving in an honest way, rather than relying on this work mechanism"" – referring to miners and their energy-hogging computers.  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?  Ethereum's security will also improve, he added. When the switch is made, he said, it could cost more than $11 billion at today’s prices to attack the blockchain, much more expensive than an attack through the proof-of-work mechanism.  Decentralization would be another benefit, said Van Loon. Participants can join and produce blocks on the network “with a minimal barrier to entry.”  Van Loon said users will not need to do anything ahead of the Merge, such as removing their ether (ETH) off-chain or placing it in cold wallets or on an exchange. “It's not necessary.

The governing Conservative Party picked Truss as leader of the party and the country’s prime minister on Monday. Johnson was pushed to resign after his government turned against him earlier this year. One of Truss’ first duties is to select her cabinet.  Kwarteng supported Truss’ campaign and is currently the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy. As the new Treasury department head, Kwarteng will have to tackle high inflation and a recession.  Former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak had plans to turn the country into a crypto hub before he resigned from the government in July. It is unclear to what extent Kwarteng supports Sunak’s crypto vision for the country.  However, in a report from June 2021, Kwarteng’s department identified blockchain systems as one of the “seven technology families that will transform our economy in the future.” In July, his previous department announced a 53 million British pound (US$61.3 million) fund for supporting technological innovation, including the use of blockchain in supply chains.

The way he sees it, the bankrupt crypto firm shouldn’t have it at all.  Baba is one of the more than 100,000 angry clients whose crypto – valued in the billions of dollars – remains in court-ordered limbo as Voyager tries to right itself. But the Virginia resident has found himself in an even more gut-wrenching sort of purgatory.  At 2:07 p.m. ET on July 1, Baba bought 10,000 USDC stablecoins from Voyager using $10,000 in cash that he wanted to get off the platform. Voyager quickly processed the buy; two minutes later, Baba tried to send the stablecoins to an external wallet. But his transfer was never processed. Before the hour was up, Voyager issued a press release telling him and the world that it had frozen all activity at 2:00 p.m., seven minutes before Baba bought USDC.  “Why did they fill my buy order” after the firm had already shut trading, deposits and withdrawals down? Baba asked in an interview with CoinDesk.  Read more: Behind Voyager’s Fall: Crypto Broker Acted Like a Bank, Went Bankrupt  On Monday, Baba asked Voyager’s bankruptcy court to either force the company to honor his stablecoin withdrawal request or reverse the buy order and let him reclaim his dollars. He did so after two months of chasing answers from Voyager’s customer support in vain.  The quirky court action is just one story in Voyager’s multibillion-dollar slog through bankruptcy proceedings. Felled by the implosion of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, it's now trying to dig itself out of a balance sheet hole that has left retail customers in the lurch. Most of those had parked their crypto in Voyager’s high-yield “earn” products long before the July 1 freeze – Baba included.  Drawn to Voyager one year earlier by the perception of a stable, well-regarded crypto lender, exchange and yield farm, Baba had invested in crypto worth $32,000 at its height through the company’s app. Most of those assets have deprecated severely in the interim, and all of them are now stuck in bankruptcy limbo. Baba says he is not trying to get that money back.  What Baba now wants to know is why Voyager let him essentially throw good money after bad. If, as Voyager says, it shut down all activity at 2:00 p.m., then he shouldn’t have been able to turn his government-protected dollars into stablecoins at all. Voyager’s support team denied his stablecoin transfer request on July 5.  ""When I contacted the support team I asked them, 'Why did you deny my crypto transfer?' They said I had submitted the transfer at 2 [p.m.], after the platform was closed. But I said, 'Your platform was open, I was able to submit it. Why did you fill my USDC order? You should have denied it.'""  Read more: Bankrupt Crypto Lender Voyager Digital to Reopen Cash Withdrawals  According to Baba, Voyager’s bankruptcy lawyers from Kirkland & Ellis say that he got caught in the crawl space between when Voyager shut off withdrawals and shut down buys. While Voyager had a “definitive cutoff” for withdrawal requests, its “order system required a gradual wind-down” that left some room for buys to continue apace, according to a screenshot of his correspondence with the law firm that he shared with the court.  Baba says he shouldn't have to pay the price for what he described as a “flaw” in Voyager’s order book. Voyager knew it was shutting off his and everyone else’s ability to flee for safety, he said, adding, “They took the money in but they did not let the money out.”",NEGATIVE,USDC,EXCHANGE | FIAT | SPONSORED | TRADING | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/06/voyager-kept-taking-buy-orders-after-freezing-crypto-transfers-now-this-trader-is-stuck,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f967a65dc272dc5997c248cf5de55840caccd2aa-2048x1535.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411382,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNQn3,1662484963,Who Benefits From Binance Converting USDC to Its Own Stablecoin?,"On Monday, Binance, the largest global crypto exchange by volume, announced it is killing access to three stablecoins that compete with its own dollar vehicle, Binance USD (BUSD). Binance said it’s making the move to improve liquidity and capital efficiency on the exchange.  Beginning Sept. 29, Binance will automatically convert users’ USD coin (USDC), Pax dollar (USDP) and trueUSD (TUSD) holdings into BUSD. Binance Pay, the exchange’s payments service, will also stop supporting those coins on Sept. 12.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Binance is suspending spot, future and margin trading with the targeted coins, closing down all associated trading pairs. But users will apparently still be able to withdraw capital in USDC, USDP and TUSD – just not custody it directly on the exchange.  While those who say this is an overt power grab that raises novel antitrust questions have a point, it’s hard to argue that BUSD isn’t already popular. It’s a viable alternative to the other U.S. dollar stablecoins. I’m going to quickly try to see it from Binance’s point of view. Undoubtedly, liquidity conditions will improve on the exchange.  BUSD is the third-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, and has increasingly been growing its share of stablecoin trading volumes ever since Binance eliminated trading fees for bitcoin (BTC) on its platform this summer.  Circle’s USDC, the most important of the affected coins, is the second-largest stablecoin at a capitalization of about $52 billion. TUSD and USDP stand as the sixth- and seventh-largest stablecoins, capitalized at just over $1 billion and just under $1 billion, respectively.  As part of the move, Binance will also close access to its USDC-denominated saving accounts, decentralized finance (DeFi) staking services and loans. Counter-intuitively, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire tweeted that the ""converged dollar books on Binance ... is a good thing” for its stablecoin.  “Prediction: This move leads to a gradual net share shift from USDT to BUSD and USDC,” Allaire tweeted, linking to a thread by Evgeny Gaevoy, the chief executive of trading platform Wintermute. (USDT, of course, is tether, the biggest stablecoin by issuance. It's also conspicuously absent from Binance's plans.)  Gaevoy’s, and perhaps Binance’s, argument is that this cuts out steps for USDC users who want to trade on Binance. People can still issue USDC as before, deposit it on Binance, do what they want to do and withdraw in USDC. Notably, exchange FTX has had automatic conversion of USDC, which has benefited market makers, he added.  Meanwhile, there’s friction for USDT traders, who still have to manually convert their assets – a “a T+1 process” that may cause it to lose “ground,” Gaevoy said. Still, others think it's obvious that the world's largest exchange dampening the usability of USDC would clearly benefit tether – over the past year Circle has been eating into Tether's marketshare. But that's largely do to USDC's use across decentralized finance and Tether's continuing trust issues, not trading volumes on a centralized exchange.  See also: Why DeFi Giants Aave, Curve Want Their Own Stablecoins | The Node  All of this is fairly speculative and does raise questions about possible monopolistic behavior. Binance has cause to increase the utility of its BUSD stablecoin, issued by Paxos, but it would still cut into USDC trading volumes. If Binance’s self-reported transaction volume is correct, the exchange is leaps and bounds ahead of competitors.  “[W]hile optimizing dollar liquidity on the world’s largest exchange may carry benefits, the paradigm does raise potential market conduct questions,” Circle told multiple publications.  But USDC will still be accessible on other major exchanges, perhaps weakening the case for antitrust action. Further, because the exchange is still offering USDC withdrawals, it presumably will be holding a massive USDC bag.",NEGATIVE,USDT | USDC,EXCHANGE | TRADING | USDT | BNB | USDC,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/06/who-benefits-from-binance-converting-usdc-to-its-own-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6b72a6f093950a512c00f5ce4db88693bc9fa39-4304x3228.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the second half of the year, KPMG expects investors to move away from companies offering coins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and toward blockchain infrastructure projects, particularly those that involve the use of blockchain in updating financial technology. The firm sees a growing focus on compliance and transaction traceability-related products and increased corporate interest in stablecoins as a lower-risk path to investing in crypto.  KPMG predicts that well-managed crypto companies with healthy risk and cost-management strategies will survive the downturn, while the resilience of other crypto companies will be “tested very hard as some look to recapitalize at lower valuations.”  Read more: Crypto VC Investments Drop 26% in First Half of 2022",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/06/crypto-investment-slowdown-will-continue-through-rest-of-2022-predicts-kpmg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d393b9ba67e8dd942a70f1acb2df76662d117761-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As mentioned above, crypto casinos that accept coins like bitcoin provide users a high level of privacy and transparency to enjoy their favorite titles without having to worry about data compromise. Additionally, these casinos often do not require any type of extensive KYC as compared to traditional casinos. The data collected during KYC registration are often sensitive, like ID images, DOB, and SSN, as well as bank information for withdrawals.

The round, led by alternative investment firm Marshall Wace, comes as the crypto market faces what some observers are calling a crypto winter. The total cryptocurrency market cap has slumped to less than $1 trillion from about $3 trillion in November and bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, has dropped 59% this year. Firms grappling with lower cryptocurrency prices have been forced to cut costs, with casualties including investment fund Three Arrows Capital and lender Celsius Network.  Despite that environment, profitability, revenue generation and growth in assets under management (AUM) all allowed for the latest fundraising, 21Shares’ co-founders Hany Rashwan and Ophelia Snyder told CoinDesk. The firm wants to expand outside of Europe and Australia into the Middle East. It reached a peak AUM of $3 billion in November 2021, before crypto's retreat.  “We find bear markets to be incredible times to build,” Rashwan said in an interview.  Other investors in the round include Collab+Currency, Quiet Ventures, ETFS Capital and Valor Equity Partners.  In May, 21Shares launched two crypto ETPs in the U.S. to capitalize on global demand. 21Shares has also teamed up with Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management in hopes of listing a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S.  Read more: Swiss ETP Issuer 21Shares Dives Into US Market With 2 Crypto Index Funds",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/06/crypto-investment-product-firm-21shares-parent-raises-25m-pushing-valuation-to-2b,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00cea99b7be6c869d6bff6171136f2fc8c08f634-3672x2754.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394830,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVo6a,1662476780,"Large Ethereum Miners Look to Cloud Computing, AI Ahead of The Merge","Some of the world's biggest Ethereum miners are looking to shift their computing power to cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) ahead of the network's move to a different type of consensus mechanism — an upgrade, known as the Merge.  The Merge is set to take place around Sept. 13-16, and it will switch from proof-of-work (PoW) in favor of proof-of-stake (PoS), which will do away with the need for large amounts of computing power and data centers, and is expected to reduce the network's energy consumption by at least 99.95%.  Canadian crypto miner Hive Blockchain (HIVE) – which was skeptical of the Merge even happening just last month – said on Tuesday that it was testing other coins that are mineable with its fleets of graphics processing units (GPUs) as well as cloud computing and AI applications.  Read more: What the Merge Means for Ethereum Miners  The miner already has a test pilot project running at a ""Tier 3"" data center, where a portion of the Nvidia A40 GPU cards are being applied to cloud computing. ""These cards [A40] can be used for cloud computing and AI applications, and rendering for engineering applications, in addition to scientific modeling of fluid dynamics,"" the company said in the press release.  Meanwhile, another Canadian miner, Hut 8 (HUT), which has been diversifying into high-performance computing since the start of the year, also said Tuesday that its latest batch of installed GPUs will be ""designed to pivot on demand to provide Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or VFX rendering services to customers.""  There has been plenty of speculation on what the Ethereum miners will do after the Merge. One theory is that miners will redirect their mining rigs to Ethereum Classic, which is the splinter network that emerged from the 2016 hard fork after a hack in which $60 million was stolen from one of the earliest decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) on the Ethereum network.  Ethereum Classic has, in fact, emerged as a potential winner ahead of Ethereum’s Merge event scheduled for later this month, with network metrics surging to lifetime highs and ETC tokens gaining value in a mostly little-changed crypto market. The Ethereum Classic hashrate reached over 48.64 terahashes per second (TH/s) as of Tuesday morning, having surged more than 133% since July, while ETC tokens have gained some 28% in the past 24 hours.  The price of Hive's shares fell more than 5%, while Hut 8's stock was down about 3%, in line with most of the mining peers on Tuesday.

Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade below the $20,000 mark on Tuesday as stock futures inched higher following the Labor Day long weekend. Ether (ETH) outperformed bitcoin as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted the Bellatrix hard fork would take place today. The Bellatrix will “prepare” the chain for the upcoming Merge.  Ether was up 7% over the last 24 hours, compared to bitcoin which was up 1%. Other altcoins also outperformed the world’s largest cryptocurrency on Tuesday, with ethereum classic (ETC) surging 27%. Avalanche’s AVAX was up 7% and Lido DAO, a liquid staking system for Ethereum, was up 13%.  DeFi giant Aave stopped loaning ether ahead of the Merge. The community is worried that users might increasingly borrow ether ahead of the Merge, exposing the protocol to liquidity issues and injecting volatility into Lido’s staked ether market.

GMX surged to a record high this week amid the rising interest from traders betting on the growth of Arbitrum.  Binance  On Monday crypto exchange Binance announced it will convert all USDC, USDP (pax dollar) and TUSD into Binance USD (BUSD), a USD-backed stablecoin issued by the exchange, on Sept. 29.  Binance announced in July an elimination of trading fees for all BTC-stablecoin pairs, which resulted in a significant increase in market share for the exchange.  Data from Kaiko shows that BUSD’s market share of stablecoin volume has hit an all-time high.  “The next steps for Binance and BUSD will be interesting: Will it attempt to encroach on USDC’s top spot in [decentralized finance], or will it continue to focus on USDT’s centralized exchange dominance?” wrote Kaiko in a weekly newsletter.  “Given Binance’s success and growth, the answer may be both,” said Kaiko.

The Ethereum Classic hashrate reached over 48.64 terahashes per second (TH/s) as of Tuesday morning, having surged more than 133% since July and overtaking the previous record of 28 TH/s set in April. A terahash is a unit that indicates the power of a computer or mining machine. A high hashrate is considered an indicator of security because it makes it harder and more costly to take over the network.  ETC tokens have added some 28% in the past 24 hours, rising to as high as $41 in early Asian hours before retreating slightly. Futures tracking the tokens logged some $27 million in liquidations in the same period – second only to ether and ahead of bitcoin futures, which usually have the highest liquidations.  Why the sudden growth?  Ethereum Classic was formed after the DAO hack in 2016 caused a hard network fork that split the blockchain into two. The original chain continued as Ethereum Classic, while the new one was called Ethereum.  Ethereum went on to become the most-used blockchain in the world, locking up some $110 billion in total value on various applications at its peak in 2021. Growth on Ethereum Classic, on the other hand, remained tepid. Applications based on the chain locked up just over $1 million at the peak – and the network did not harbor any prominent decentralized finance application despite the sector’s outsized growth.  ETC prices did jump 10-fold during a two-month period in the 2021 bull market, but that movement came amid a speculative frenzy in the crypto market as opposed to solid fundamental growth.

Chart of the Day  stETH Discount May Widen as Merge Nears  By Omkar Godbole  Staked ether (stETH) token representing one unit of ether (ETH) that has been locked in Lido's liquid staking service currently trades at 0.96 ETH.  The discount may widen as some stETH holders may switch to ETH to receive potential Ethereum forked token ETHPOW.  Ethereum, the world's largest smart-contract blockchain, may undergo a hard fork later this month, splitting into a proof-of-stake (PoS) chain and a proof-of-work (PoW) chain.  The PoW chain will have ETHPoW as the native coin, which will be distributed to ETH holders for free.

42411079,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBzpI,1662473040,"With Crypto’s Blowups, TradFi Boasts Its Legal Rigor","Crypto finance is supposed to be about bucking existing financial market norms and breaking free of the grip of incumbent bankers.  But those established players are now pushing back, arguing that their way of doing business adds rigor that is missing in crypto.  Take now-bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network, which last year received a $1 billion loan from stablecoin issuer Tether that was backed by bitcoin. In the U.S., courts are now poring over the exact legal status of that loan.  Celsius’ creditors, and maybe the firm itself, may be wondering now if they shouldn’t have ironed out those kinds of legal issues in advance rather than leaving a small fortune at the mercy of judges.  Standard-setters for conventional financial markets certainly think so. They have told CoinDesk that the crypto world should adopt the existing norms that govern securities lending in traditional finance markets to avoid messy situations in the future.  One of the issues for Celsius is whether it properly considered the legal rights to the bitcoin that backed its loan from Tether, Daniel Franks, a partner at the law firm of Ashurst in London, said in an interview.  Read more: ​Bankrupt Crypto Lender Celsius Now Says It Likely Has Enough Cash to Last Through End of Year  Taking financial instruments as collateral for loans, as Tether apparently did, is commonplace in TradFi markets, and some say a secondary market fueled by lending is a prerequisite for liquidity in a given security. But those kinds of trades often take place under standard “master” contracts developed by the likes of the International Securities Lending Association (ISLA), a nonprofit industry association that covers Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Crypto extension  In August – after requests from both TradFi players and new market entrants – ISLA asked Franks to look into how to extend existing legal norms to cover cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, as well conventional stocks and bonds that take on virtual form with distributed ledger technology.  That will be much more than just a find-and-replace job. Adapting the Global Master Securities Lending Agreement, some 40 pages of legal text, for the crypto age isn’t just about replacing the word “securities” with “crypto,” Franks says.  Some features of crypto – such as airdrops, the free tokens that are provided as an incentive – don’t have an exact analog in conventional financial contracts, he said. There can also be differences or ambiguities about how cryptocurrencies are treated under property law, which is a question legal experts in jurisdictions such as the U.K. are already grappling with.  Franks suggests there could also be new crypto-enabled innovations, such as rules that allow for “dual control,” where a digital asset changes hands only if instructions are given by two different parties.  But, Franks said, the Celsius case has shown that some contracts used in crypto markets just aren’t up to snuff.  “There is certainly range in terms of the robustness of, and level of detail in, those documents, particularly when used amongst market participants who are not traditional finance providers and who do not have the benefit of experience with using loan documentation in other industries,” Franks said.  Will crypto have a say?  Franks’ legal advice – he’s already provided a first draft privately to ISLA – will aim to offer financiers “as much comfort as possible” in handling crypto, he said. Now the next steps could come as soon as September, Tina Baker, ISLA’s head of legal services, told CoinDesk.  “In the coming weeks, we look forward to announcing the findings of the initial analysis to our members for them to review,” Baker said.  The risk is that the crypto world won’t get much of a look in during the ensuing consultation. ISLA’s 183 members are mainly traditional banks – JPMorgan Chase, HSBC and UBS among them – as well as financial infrastructure entities such as Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., which processes basically all trades in the U.S. stock market, and European exchange giant Eurex. But, Baker notes, the crypto industry does have a voice there. Digital-asset lobby group Global Digital Finance is also a participant, and others are welcome to join.  Baker says “tried and tested” standards remain popular, but ultimately no one – be they from crypto or TradFi – is obliged to use her favored contracts.  This may not be an easy journey. Adapting incumbent practices to fit the fast-developing world of crypto is already tricky: And, Franks notes, that’s just the half of it. Crypto technologies may also need to align toward existing models in order to access the securities lending markets, he says.  Both Franks and Baker seem confident that’s possible. The big question is whether Web3 players will see it the same way.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/06/with-cryptos-blowups-tradfi-boasts-its-legal-rigor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b00fa2a824b0dbd56d4bc6e843ab8d10073b836-4560x3420.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394819,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVnyi,1662469520,7 Trends That Could Reignite Crypto Growth,"Wall Street investment firm Bernstein last week listed seven predictions that could reignite growth in crypto.  1. The Ethereum Merge is successful  Even though the switch to a proof-of-stake method of maintaining its network from a proof-of-work one is just days away, there remains a healthy bit of skepticism, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote in a note last week. They believe it will happen between Sept. 10 and Sept. 20, and it will be a positive catalyst for crypto.  Read more: The Final Countdown to the Ethereum Merge Has Officially Begun  2. Rollups to bring the next wave of crypto user demand  Chhugani and Agrawal said there has been a notable increase in user numbers, on-chain liquidity and transactions on rollups such as Optimism and Arbitrum, with transaction activity on rollups now making up around 15%-25% of all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Rollups are Ethereum layer 2 platforms that help process transactions separately from the main network to increase speed and lower costs.  3. Ether flips bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency  The most asked question by investors is when will the ether (ETH) market cap eclipse bitcoin’s (BTC), the note said. For digital assets, what is more important is that it becomes more of an “innovation-driven, structural trend rather than a macroeconomic asset class.” Ether represents this “innovation-crypto,” and if it succeeds in building the blockchain digital economy, ETH could be adopted as digital money, the team argued.  4. DeFi on rollups brings back the DeFi summer  The summer of 2020 was the first “DeFi summer,” but since then, the decentralized-finance sector has underperformed layer 1 chains, the analysts said. Layer 2 scalability, however, is now making DeFi affordable again, the Bernstein analysts wrote, noting that the Uniswap exchange now gets about 10% of its fees from rollups.  5. NFTs pivot to gaming and play-to-earn becomes play-to-own  “Crypto games will have their own unique culture,” the Bernstein team said. “Over a million NFT (non-fungible token) avatars will become playable characters across multiple interoperable crypto games.” Chhugani and Agrawal are seeing a big migration in talent to Web3 game development from traditional gaming studios – a strong leading indicator in their opinion.  6. Token economic designs start to focus on value accumulation  “More sustainable token designs will bring back retail interest in investing in application tokens versus the latest fast blockchain or retail meme coins,” the analysts wrote.  7. Fat protocol thesis becomes the fat application thesis  The ""fat protocol thesis"" suggests that value in blockchains would accumulate at the base protocol layer, rather than at the application layer. Bernstein said that the “long-tail of application tokens” will grow thanks to enhanced scalability, economical transaction costs, better user growth on rollups, improved token value accrual and retail interest to invest in applications that they use.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | ARB,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/06/what-might-restart-the-crypto-bull-market-bernstein-has-ideas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43fb07d126a71c279e583c0ec58d83ab80ec1550-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It was initially believed that the wallet belonged to insolvent hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  CORRECTION (Sept. 7, 13:30UTC): This article previously reported the withdrawal as going to a Three Arrows Capital wallet.  “This wallet was labelled Three Arrows Capital (3AC) due to it receiving large amounts of crypto from another known 3AC wallet. After investigating further, we’ve confirmed it was a 3AC counterparty managing this wallet: Matrixport. We’ve updated the label to reflect this,"" Nansen told Blockworks.  The wallet also removed 200 bitcoins (BTC), $4 million in tether (USDT) and $4 million worth of wrapped ether (wETH) in liquidity from Convex, a platform that boosts rewards for Curve stakers and liquidity providers.  The wallet, which was previously tagged as belonging to Three Arrows Capital by Nansen, has been inactive for 10 days since it unwrapped $9 million worth of wrapped stETH. Nansen has since confirmed to Blockworks that the wallet was incorrectly tagged and that it belongs to Matrixport.  Three Arrows Capital was one of several firms that have crashed during this year's crypto bear market. It owes its creditors $2.8 billion, according to a court filing published in July by its liquidator Teneo, following a series of highly leveraged trades in relation to the Terra (LUNA) network, which collapsed in May.  New York-based Teneo secured an important court decision in Singapore on Aug. 24 that allows it to probe Three Arrow's local assets there. At the time, Teneo had control of at least $40 million of the firm's assets.  Three Arrows Capital didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Futures tracking the tokens logged $27 million in liquidations in the same period – second only to ether and ahead of bitcoin futures, which usually have the highest liquidations.  Why the sudden growth?  Ethereum Classic was formed after the DAO hack in 2016 caused a hard network fork that split the blockchain into two. The original chain continued as Ethereum Classic, while the new one was called Ethereum.  Ethereum went on to become the most-used blockchain in the world, locking up $110 billion in total value on various applications at its peak in 2021. Growth on Ethereum Classic, on the other hand, remained tepid. Applications based on the chain locked up just over $1 million at the peak, and the network didn't harbor any prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) application despite the sector’s outsized growth.  ETC prices did jump 10-fold during a two-month period in the 2021 bull market, but that movement came amid a speculative frenzy in the crypto market as opposed to solid fundamental growth.  What the bull market failed to ignite is now being catalyzed by the Merge instead. The Merge, which will shift Ethereum from its current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one, has turned the focus of key network participants back to Ethereum Classic.  Developers say the move away from a proof-of-work system will make the network much cheaper and faster and environmentally friendly. It will also mean the end of an income stream for Ethereum miners, who are rewarded with ether tokens for supplying resources to the blockchain.  ""Post-Ethereum Merge, the Ethereum PoW miners will need to mine other coins since Ethereum is moving to PoS,"" Hosam Mazawi, a co-founder at non-fungible token project Snook, wrote in a Telegram message. ""The options are Ethereum Classic or some new Ethereum fork.""  Miners produced over $620 million worth of ether in July alone, data shows, making the Merge akin to a death knell for a significant chunk of cash.  Still, it’s not a though Ethereum Classic will be without competition. A group of miners involved in 2016’s fork have floated their interest in forking Ethereum again after the Merge, creating ETHPOW, a token that would power the proof-of-work Ethereum network.  ETHPOW backers include Tron founder Justin Sun and prominent Chinese miner Chandler Guo. Sun has pledged more than 1 million ethers to help support and develop the chain.",POSITIVE,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/06/ethereum-classic-hashrate-prices-surge-as-miners-prepare-for-post-merge-reality,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20ac7a9f205b4e41796bf03411c6001514b11876-3917x2938.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394831,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVo9X,1662464475,The Final Countdown to the Ethereum Merge Has Officially Begun,"The Ethereum blockchain’s Merge is officially underway and will likely kick in sometime between Sept. 13-16. The Bellatrix upgrade – the network's final ""hard fork"" before the Merge – was activated on Tuesday, marking the beginning of Ethereum’s long-awaited transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).  The Bellatrix upgrade prepares Ethereum's PoS Beacon Chain – also called its Consensus layer – for a Merge with Ethereum's mainnet Execution layer.  The Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) value triggering the Merge has been set at 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000. This number, which will represent the cumulative difficulty of all mined Ethereum blocks, is expected to be reached somewhere between Sept. 13-16. Predictions right now are that it will happen around Sept. 15.  When the TTD number is reached, the network will merge its Execution layer with the new PoS Consensus layer, allowing the chain to continue on with a new system for issuing and authenticating blocks of transactions.  According to the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization funding Ethereum ecosystem development, the Merge will cut the network's energy usage by 99.95% and set the stage for further improvements to its core infrastructure.  At the point of the Merge, the difficulty level on Ethereum's PoW network will increase to the point where mining new blocks will no longer be possible.  The Merge has been a long time coming, and the Beacon Chain was first introduced in December 2020.  Last month, Ethereum merged its Goerli test network (testnet) from PoW to PoS – marking the third and final dress rehearsal for a mainnet Merge.  The completion of the Merge will mark the end of Ethereum’s energy-intensive proof-of-work chapter. The next steps on Ethereum's roadmap involve improving fees and transaction speeds via sharding and rollups.  The price of ether (ETH) was recently $1,665, up 6.24% over the past 24 hours.

42394832,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVoAW,1662463388,Traders Bet on GMX Tokens as Proxy for Ethereum Layer 2 Tool Arbitrum,"Tokens of decentralized exchange (DEX) GMX have surged to a record high this week amid rising interest from traders betting on the growth of Arbitrum, a prominent Ethereum layer-2 scaling product.  GMX allows users to trade spot and perpetual futures using its on-chain trading interface at low fees. Part of its popularity can be attributed to the rise of Arbitrum, a layer 2 network that is based on the Ethereum blockchain. GMX locks up over $309 million on Arbitrum and $78 million on the Avalanche network, data from DeFiLlama shows.  Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1, or base, blockchains. This software bundles multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, which helps reduce the data load, leading to faster network transactions at lower costs.  Arbitrum, one of the most popular Ethereum layer 2 networks, successfully deployed its Nitro upgrade in August, which improved the user experience for application developers, reduced network fees and increased transaction speeds.  Technical documents show the upgrade would reduce Arbitrum’s fees because it's compressing data files sent to the Ethereum mainnet for validation. Such improvements have caused a jump in fundamentals after the Nitro upgrade, with Arbitrum seeing a record 349,000 transactions on Monday, mostly as transactions were settled nearly instantly at fees of less than 10 cents.  Such improvements are a benefit for Arbitrum users over using Ethereum, where fees are over $1 – and over $9,500 during times of demand – with considerably lower transaction speeds.  How Arbitrum is driving GMX token growth  Since Arbitrum has yet to introduce its own tokens, investors are turning to GMX and other Arbitrum-centric tokens to gain exposure to the layer 2 network. GMX traded at just under $15 in July, before demand caused the tokens to surge and approach lifetime highs of $56 on Monday.  ""Investors are waiting for the popular Arbitrum network to launch its own token,"" Daniel Kostecki, director at financial-services firm Conotoxia, wrote in a Telegram message. ""But emerging interest needs to be somehow satisfied, and GMX has seen an increase in the value of the token due to the growth of the Arbitrum network.""  Such movements came even as the broader cryptocurrency market held steady, with bitcoin and ether trading in narrow ranges. Bitcoin was trading at just under $20,000 on Tuesday, while ether has seen increased volatility ahead of its software update called the Merge later this month.  GMX added $100 million in total value locked to its platform in the past month, and addresses holding the tokens have grown to more than 46,000 from just 13,000 at the start of August.  The DEX has processed more than $45 billion in trading volume since its inception in 2021 and has generated $60 million in revenue, part of which is shared with users who supply liquidity to the protocol. Data further shows GMX has over $82 million in open interest, or the number of unsettled futures contracts, as of Tuesday, a metric that indicates interest in its on-chain futures offering.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | ARB | MX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/06/traders-bet-on-gmx-tokens-as-proxy-for-ethereum-layer-2-solution-arbitrum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/768d52501f4fd74b4b055a6ab323764ad8ee2326-5332x3999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the loss was relatively small, the attack highlighted the different ways in which DeFi platforms are vulnerable to cyberattacks.  The KyberSwap platform is a decentralized exchange that allows users to swap between currencies on different blockchains.

42394833,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASVoBV,1662461358,DeFi Giant Aave Stops Loaning Ether Ahead of the Merge,"Aave, a big decentralized lending platform, has invoked new rules to protect itself from several risks that could stem from a surge in borrowing demand for ether (ETH) from crypto traders betting on the Ethereum blockchain’s upcoming technological overhaul.  Between Aug. 30 and Sept. 2, the Aave community overwhelmingly voted to stop loaning ether, setting aside democratized finance's free market principle to mitigate protocol-wide risks that may arise from Ethereum's upcoming transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work (PoW) one, dubbed the Merge. The upgrade is slated to happen between Sept. 13-15.  ""Ahead of the Ethereum Merge, the Aave protocol faces the risk of high utilization in the ETH market. Temporarily pausing ETH borrowing will mitigate this risk of high utilization,"" the proposal highlighted by research firm Block Analitica said.  The utilization rate refers to the percentage of the pool loaned out. The rate will likely rise as users could borrow ETH before the Merge to receive free money or the potential Ethereum fork token ETHPOW.  Some Ethereum miners are contesting the planned transition to PoS and looking to split the chain into a PoS chain and a PoW chain. A PoW chain would have ETHPOW as its native token, which would be distributed to ETH holders for free.  According to Ian Unsworth, a researcher at Binance.US, users are borrowing ETH from lending protocols, specifically AAVE. If the trend continues, the already elevated utilization rate of over 70% could jump to 100%, CoinGecko's Bobby Ong said.  High utilization will make liquidations challenging  A spike in the utilization rate would mean most ETH has been loaned out, leaving little for liquidators as collateral to process regular liquidations of ETH borrow-based positions.  ""High utilization interferes with liquidation transactions, thus increasing the chances of insolvency for the protocol,"" Block Analitica said in the proposal.  While calling the borrowing suspension a good move, Ian Solot, a partner at crypto hedge fund Tagus Capital, said, ""The part of the problem is that if markets become very volatile and ETH borrowers need to be liquidated, there may be a scarcity of ETH due to high utilization, making it harder for liquidations to go through effectively.""  Liquidations are forced closure of positions due to a decline in the value of the collateral. Aave describes liquidations as a process that occurs when a borrower's health factor goes below 1 because their collateral value doesn't cover their loan/debt value.  ETH-funded recursive trades become unattractive  The bump in the utilization rate could lift ether borrowing rates to levels where the popular ETH-stETH recursive borrowing positions on Aave become unprofitable. That, in turn, could lead to the mass unwinding of positions, injecting volatility into the stETH market.  In recursive trades, users despot ETH into liquid staking protocol Lido in return for the staked ether token (stETH), which is then deposited as collateral on Aave to borrow more ETH. This borrowed ETH is again moved to Lido for more stETH, which is again deposited as collateral on AAVE to borrow ETH. The cycle continues. This leveraged position analogous to carry trading loses appeal once the ETH borrowing rates rise above the annualized staking rewards, which are now at 3.9% on Lido.  ""Once the ETH borrow rate reaches 5%, which happens shortly after 70% utilization rate, stETH/ETH positions start becoming unprofitable,"" Block Analitica said in the Aave ETHPOW risk mitigation plan published last month. ""This means that we would see a lot of stETH to ETH redemptions and in turn a downward push on the stETH price, which will already be under pressure due to regular stETH holders switching to ETH to gain upside on ETHPoW work.  ""All of this can lead to a downward price spiral of stETH, which can create cascading liquidations at Aave,"" Block Analitica added.  The largest ETH borrower and the two second-largest ETH borrowers on AAVE have stETH as collateral, according to data tweeted by Binance.US' Unsworth. At press time, more than $900 million worth of stETH is locked on AAVE as collateral for borrowing ETH.  Aave also faces the risk of wrapped ether (wETH) liquidity providers withdrawing coins to get in position for a potential Ethereum fork token ETHPOW. Some community members are unsure whether suspending ETH borrowing would help address that potential problem.",NEGATIVE,AAVE | ETH,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/06/defi-giant-aave-stops-loaning-ether-ahead-of-ethereum-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52343e535f7879a16268c982d960b84b7a26b7d2-1707x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Users start by purchasing a “Siber” NFT for 0.03 ETH (around $50), which grants them access to the site. From there they can form leagues and play head-to-head matchups to win “NFT prizes, merch and unique fan engagement experiences,” according to a press release.  “Play Hellebore isn’t meant to replace traditional fantasy sports,” Swinmurn told CoinDesk. “We expect crypto natives [to be] early adopters that know the value of digital ownership, but we are also passionate about helping to educate and onboard newcomers.”  The game is just the latest addition to the larger fantasy sports NFT family.

Participants in the round include Foundation Capital, Solana Ventures, Metaplex, Jump, FTX Ventures and Chapter One. The investment was a 50/50 split between company equity and its DUST token, a representative told CoinDesk.  DUST is a utility token on Solana dubbed as the official currency of the DeGods ecosystem. DeGods is known for its popular eponymous PFP, which is the highest valued collection in the Solana NFT world.  At 11:30 p.m. ET, DUST was down 30% from its daily high of $3 as traders digested the news. It’s not uncommon for tokens purchased to qualify for an NFT release to lose valuing following its mint.  The company, created by the founders of the DeGods NFT collective, specializes in providing NFT tooling to projects on Solana and Ethereum. Its first product is a “scholarships” whitelisting tool that it displayed during the y00ts mint.  The DeGods team has had a whirlwind of a week, delaying the mint for its buzzy y00ts project after a “blocker bug” last minute. Dust Labs said it will be hosting an AMA (ask me anything) on Thursday to provide further information.
