""AIP-1 is too large and covers too many topics. We will follow the DAO’s advice and split the AIP into parts,"" said the Community Lead with the handle Eli_Defi in Arbitrum's Discord server.  The backtracking comes after a day of rage in the Arbitrum community over how the Foundation – a centralized company charged with promoting Arbitrum's claimed decentralized ecosystem – held a ""ratification"" vote over decisions it had already implemented, including sending nearly $1 billion in tokens to itself.  With that vote barreling toward overwhelming failure on Snapshot, Arbutrim acknowledged it ""will likely not pass"" and pledged to hold redos over each section of its omnibus bill ""early this week.""  That was enough to win over some influential voices. The pseudonymous ChainLinkGod, a well-known crypto personality and one of the Arbitrum decentralized autonomous organization's biggest delegates, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message the Foundation was ""listening to the community and incorporating our feedback.""  ""It's a good move in the right direction in my opinion,"" ChainLinkGod said.  In the Discord post, Eli_DeFi said the 750 million ARB token allotment will now be subject to a standalone vote. ""We’re working on options to add more accountability,"" he said, noting Foundation tokens will not be used in votes. (The current vote treats the Foundation's power over that sum as a foregone conclusion; it started spending and sending tokens even before passage.)  The Arbitrum Foundation's ""special grants"" program – at the heart of the controversy – will be rebranded the ""Ecosystem Development Fund."" Arbitrum pledged to ""provide context on how the funds will be used,"" as well as a ""transparency report"" on the Foundation's budget.  ""The objective in setting up the Arbitrum DAO was to lead by example to create the most decentralized rollup, and despite this blunder of communication, we will continue to aggressively pursue this goal,"" the post said.

42421265,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmIv,1680444988,USDC's Depeg Laid Bare the Risks Traditional Finance Poses to Stablecoins,"Regulators have expressed concern in recent years that decentralized finance (DeFi) could pose risks to the traditional financial (TradFi) services sector. Those worries were magnified by events such as algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD’s (UST) collapse and the failure of the FTX crypto exchange in 2022, which had relatively limited spillover effects on established financial institutions.  Cristiano Ventricelli is the associate vice president of decentralized finance and digital assets at Moody’s Investors Service.  But a new realization has emerged following the recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank: Distress from established financial institutions can spread to the DeFi sector, too.  That is, effectively, what happened this year when Circle’s USD coin (USDC) lost its peg to the dollar on March 10, the day U.S. banking authorities stepped in to take over Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The fiat-backed stablecoin fell below 90 cents following the announcement that Circle had up to $3.3 billion in exposure to SVB, which had suffered a deposit run.  Other, smaller-circulation stablecoins lost their pegs, too, including BUSD, issued by Paxos, and crypto-backed stablecoin DAI, issued by MakerDAO. Only USDT seemed to benefit from the turmoil, briefly exceeding $1, most likely because of investors shifting out of the depegged stablecoins.  The depeg event was relatively short-lived. After U.S. banking authorities announced that uninsured depositors at Silicon Valley Bank would be fully covered, the USDC price began rising toward $1, and USDC, DAI and BUSD remain at their $1 peg as of April 2, 2023.  But, in Moody’s view, the risks have now been laid bare. What the depeggings highlighted is that stablecoin issuers’ reliance on a relatively small set of off-chain financial institutions limits their stability. And broader awareness of these risks could actually make the situation worse for stablecoin issuers.  In the aftermath of the USDC depeg, Circle managed to onboard new banking partners, thereby reducing concentration risk. Nonetheless, TradFi financial institutions could decide to reconsider working with stablecoin operators, and the reduction in the available pool of financial institutions partners would make it even more difficult for fiat-backed stablecoins to maintain stable exchange rates.  In light of these recent events, regulators could increase their scrutiny of stablecoins. Last year, the Terra collapse raised concerns about stablecoins' reserves, leading regulators to recommend additional liquidity and transparency requirements. Now, the depeg of USDC and other stablecoins is highlighting a different set of governance risks related to the custody of reserve assets. The European Union crypto asset regulation (MiCA) briefly touches on this, but leaves precise regulatory standards to be determined by European banking authorities.  Moody’s anticipates that the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures could trigger additional regulatory requirements, notably on counterparty diversification. As TradFi and DeFi become more intertwined, notably through tokenization of real world assets, the risk of systemic failure increases, emphasizing the need for effective regulation, transparency and risk management.  There is also growing interest in exploring alternative solutions to address the shortcomings of stablecoins. One potential alternative is tokenized bank deposits, which allow users to hold digital tokens that represent ownership of underlying bank deposits. Tokenized bank deposits would be subject to the regulatory standards of banking, providing greater confidence in the underlying assets’ safety, although credit risks associated with traditional banking would, of course, remain.  See also: When Will Crypto Learn From the Mistakes of Banks? | Opinion  Another potential alternative is central bank digital currencies (CBDC), digital representations of fiat currencies issued by central banks. CBDCs could eliminate the need for a third-party custodian and provide direct access to central bank reserves. However, in our view, CBDCs likely are still years away from being implemented on a large scale.  Stablecoins will likely play a significant role in the digital asset ecosystem for the foreseeable future, meaning regulators will need to keep monitoring and addressing their associated risks.",NEGATIVE,DAI | USDC,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | DAI | USDC,Cristiano Ventricelli,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/02/usdcs-depeg-laid-bare-the-risks-traditional-finance-poses-to-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed70ddc2c8f0585a4bb58715fca8c57501146afa-1367x769.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Investors have continued to withdraw their assets from the stablecoin despite assurances from issuer Circle about its reserves. USDC Market Cap Plummets By $10 Billion In Two Weeks According to data from crypto-data aggregator Coinmarketcap, USDC’s market cap has plummeted by more than 5% in the past month. In the past two weeks alone, more than $10 billion has been wiped out from its market cap. USDC’s troubles were exacerbated by the de-pegging that occurred after SVB’s downfall. Within hours the stablecoin was down 15%, leading to fears that it could follow a similar fate as that of TerraUSD, which collapsed in 2022. Related Reading: Crypto ATM Installations Decrease By Over 5,000 In 2023 – Here’s Why Investors began to withdraw their assets into other cryptocurrencies leading to panic in the crypto market. Exchanges like Binance and Coinbase followed suit by suspending auto conversions of USDC on their platforms. These negative sentiments led to Circle issuing a series of tweets informing holders that their assets were safe. Thankfully, the Federal Reserve rescued SVB and provided a bailout fund, ensuring that Circle could access the $3 billion worth of reserves stuck in the defunct bank. Since then, USDC peg has gone back to 1$. Nonetheless, the damage has been done, and investors’ confidence is at an all-time low. Tether (USDT): Biggest Winner In The Stablecoin Wars Amid the troubles with USDC, the biggest gainer has been the rival stablecoin Tether (USDT). While the USDC market cap has plummeted, USDT has witnessed a massive increase in its market cap in recent weeks. The leading stablecoin has seen its market dominance surge above 60% for the first time since 2021, buoyed by the USDC problems. Unsurprisingly, most outflows from USDC were sent to USDT as investors looked to keep their assets safe from potential liquidation. USDT has also benefited from the uncertainty behind the rival stablecoin BUSD. Earlier in February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered Paxos, the issuer of the Binance-backed stablecoin, to stop minting. This led to a significant decline in the market cap of BUSD, with USDT taking a lion’s share of the volume. Related Reading: Cardano Stands Out In Robinhood’s Top Movers List For The Week Paolo Ardoino, the CTO of Tether, recently said that he expects $700 million in profits for the company for this first quarter. A staggering sum, bringing the USDT issuer’s excess reserves to over $1.6 billion. Another significant winner is TrueUSD (TUSD), whose market capitalization has doubled since the beginning of the year. Despite these moves, USDC remains the second-largest stablecoin with a market cap of $32 billion at the time of writing. It will be interesting to see if the USDC will recover in the coming weeks and challenge USDT’s position as the top stablecoin.

42412460,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4yvU,1680436108,Arbitrum Foundation Sold ARB Tokens Ahead of 'Ratification' Vote; ARB Falls,"The Arbitrum Foundation began selling ARB tokens for stablecoins even before its governance community of tokenholders had ""ratified"" the organization's nearly $1 billion budget, according to a blog post from one employee early Sunday.  The price of ARB fell after CoinDesk's report of the post, with the token falling to $1.17, down 9% in the last 24 hours.  According to Patrick McCorry, the Arbitrum Foundation – a centralized organization responsible for promoting Arbitrum, a faster and cheaper blockchain for transacting on Ethereum – thought of the omnibus governance package Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP-1) as a ""ratification"" of decisions it had already made, such as receiving 7.5% of all ARB tokens.  To that end, the Foundation ""has begun to use these tokens in the interest of the [decentralized autonomous organization], including conversion of some funds into stablecoins for operational purposes,"" McCorry said in the Foundation's first official comment on a mounting governance crisis.  The response adds new uncertainties to Arbitrum's first attempt at community governance. Just one week ago, Arbitrum airdropped ARB governance tokens to hundreds of thousands of wallets of as a way of empowering owners in critical decisions. The first of those was seemingly AIP-1, an omnibus package that covered everything from governance and emergency powers to funding and grants.  In a followup tweet, the Foundation said it loaned 40 million ARB tokens to ""a sophisticated actor in the financial markets space,"" referring to the market maker Wintermute. It sold an additional 10 million tokens for “fiat” to cover operations. Arbitrum promised to ""share more information soon"" about the situation.  “The point of AIP-1 was to inform the community of all of the decisions that were made in advance,” McCorry said, pushing back at perceptions that token holders had a say in the matter.  McCorry’s post offered Arbitrum’s first official response to a debacle that exploded Friday after governance hawks called out the Arbitrum Foundation’s “special grants” program. According to the proposal, the Foundation is getting 750 million ARB tokens (around $1 billion) to spend without token holders’ approval.  Last week, Arbitrum began airdropping over 1 billion ARB tokens to nearly 300,000 wallets as part of its effort to share power over the network with its users, a common trope in crypto communities. Holders of the ARB token are considered part of ArbitrumDAO, the group that votes on proposals such as AIP-1.  But AIP-1 wasn’t much of a vote at all, according to McCorry’s explanation – at least, not when it came to the budget requests. He said the Arbitrum Foundation has already started spending the tokens it was apparently earmarked to get.  McCorry's post may serve to confound what has turned into an early crisis for Arbitrum governance. Votes in favor of “ratification” were winning until the past few hours. The tide, however, has now shifted strongly toward rejection, raising questions of what will happen if AIP-1 is defeated.  McCorry said there’s a “chicken and egg problem” in setting up decentralized governance structures. In the case of Arbitrum, “certain parameters need to be decided” ahead of time, including the structure of a “security council” that wields emergency powers, deciding voting mechanics, and of course, the funding.  Whereas AIP-1 framed the Foundation’s power to issue “special grants” without community votes as an effort to avoid “voter fatigue,” McCorry said these blank-check powers are “fundamental” to the ecosystem’s competitive edge. He referred to recent efforts by Polygon and other blockchain companies to land deals with the likes of Starbucks, partnerships that happened behind closed doors.  “While it would be incredible if all traditional companies agreed to do everything on-chain, this is not realistically going to happen,” he said.

In the latest development, Bitcoin and crypto ATM installations have dropped by more than 5,000 units in 2023 based on data from Coin ATM Radar. Global Crypto ATM Network Records Heavy Decline In Q1 2023 Although the crypto market began the year with a bounce following the FTX crises, Coin ATM Radar recorded that 1,587 Bitcoin ATMs were uninstalled and decommissioned in the month of January. Going into February, when several assets experienced a general price loss, the crypto ATM network saw some positives, with only 275 units going offline globally. However, the month of March was quite dreadful as 3,627 ATMs across the world were removed from the network representing the biggest monthly decline on the crypto ATM network in over nine years. Source: coinatmradar.com According to Coin ATM Radar, the total negative net change of ATM installations in 2023 so far is 5,489, leaving only 33,729 active ATMs operating all over the world. Of these lots, over 28,000 units are in the United States, accounting for over 84% of the global crypto ATM network. Other countries with a good presence of Bitcoin ATMs include Canada, Australia, Switzerland, etc. Related Reading: Cardano Stands Out In Robinhood’s Top Movers List For The Week Behind The Decline Since the introduction of the first Bitcoin ATM in 2013, crypto ATM net change has always been positive, barring a negative record in September 2022 and the first three months of this year. That said, there could be various reasons behind this sudden and unusual drop in ATM installations. However, the most notable one appears to be a drastic reduction in the number of installed crypto ATMs in the United States going as far back as last year. Source: coinatmradar.com According to Coin ATM radar, over 5,000 ATMs in the U.S. have gone offline between November 2022 and the present date. And although other nations such as Australia, Canada, Spain, and other crypto-friendly countries have recorded positive Bitcoin ATM growth in this same period, the dominance of the U.S. paints a rather gloomy picture for the global crypto ATM network. The negative ATM installation growth in the U.S. could be as a result of several factors, including the crypto winter that occurred in late 2022 and its ripple effects which led to the collapse of some U.S. crypto-friendly banks earlier this year. That said, it remains unknown how long this decline in ATM installations will continue. However, many could hope for a recovery soon as these teller machines are vital to the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency worldwide.
