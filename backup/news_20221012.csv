This comes even when the market is seeing struggling prices and investors have begun to take more conservative positions in the market. The drastic increase in the open interest across these two cryptocurrencies could have some significant implications for the crypto market as a whole. Ethereum Spikes With Bitcoin Bitcoin open interest has been on the rise over the last couple of weeks, which has led to some interesting forecasts for the digital asset, and now, Ethereum has begun following the same trend.

42435008,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGniVv,1665613073,"IMF’s Georgieva Warns Central Banks to Hoard Reserves, Follow Fed Hikes","Washington, D.C. — The head of the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday central banks should refrain from currency interventions, instead suggesting they use interest-rate raises as the preferred tool for combating foreign-exchange weakness versus the dollar.  “Do not waste your reserves to protect your currency,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said during an on-stage discussion at the organization's annual meeting in Washington, D.C. ""When your currency is depreciating because of this mismatch of fundamentals, if you throw your reserves to defend it, the only thing you’ll get out of it is a weak position for the future.”  Emerging-market currencies have been roiled by a strengthening dollar as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to combat rising consumer prices in the U.S. Because so many countries are dependent on imports, higher local prices for international goods – often denominated in dollars – have triggered bouts of inflation around the world. A stronger dollar also makes it harder for emerging-market countries to repay dollar-denominated debt because taxes are usually assessed in the local currency.  Such foreign-exchange fluctuations are closely monitored by some bitcoin traders because the largest cryptocurrency's price is inversely correlated with the U.S. dollar's strength in foreign-exchange markets.  'Do not fight a battle you cannot win'  Georgieva noted that some countries had raised their interest rates to stay in lockstep with the Fed's hikes. In general, when a country has a higher interest rate, its domestic bonds are more attractive to global investors, a dynamic that in turn leads to a stronger exchange rate.  The Bank of Mexico, for example, raised its interest rate for an 11th time in September in an attempt to a range of 8.5% to 9.25% in an attempt to tame inflation, which is currently at 8.8%, slightly higher than in the U.S. As a result, the Mexican peso (MXN) has held up much stronger against the U.S. dollar (DXY) than other emerging market currencies.  “We actually have seen a number of emerging markets that have been quite proactive to assess the direction that the economy was taking and increase interest rates before the Fed,” Georgieva said.  The Colombian peso, on the other hand, fell recently after Colombia’s central bank delivered a smaller than expected rate hike.  “Actually what she is saying is very important,” said Dick Bove, chief financial strategist at Odeon Capital. “She is basically arguing that the Fed will not ease and that the dollar will continue to rise. So do not fight a battle you cannot win.”  Because the U.S. dollar is the world’s reserve currency, the Federal Reserve is by default “the central banker to the world,” Bove said, which means that if the Fed tightens, all other major central banks must follow suit if they want their country’s currency to remain on the same level as the dollar.  The perplexing question of how central banks respond to a strong dollar could become a factor in crypto markets, if indirectly. Bitcoin (BTC) is inversely correlated with the dollar’s strength in foreign exchange markets, so if central banks fight back against their weakening foreign-exchange rates the cryptocurrency might benefit.  There’s also speculation going back years in crypto circles that people in emerging markets might turn to digital assets like bitcoin as a safe haven if they’re seeing high inflation or economic turmoil in their home countries.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Helene Braun, Bradley Keoun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/12/imfs-georgieva-warns-central-banks-to-hoard-reserves-follow-fed-hikes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90e5928341ae2328ff55b3f62f39d7468e23142d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394028,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69buO3Aj,1665609329,StoryDAO and the Quest to Recreate Hollywood,"Hollywood is a $100 billion business. Much of that business, for better or worse, is now fueled by franchise intellectual property (IP) – “Star Wars,” the “MCU,” “Harry Potter,” “Fast & Furious.” If you own the IP, you own the game.  But what if that IP was owned by the fans? This is the conceit of StoryDAO, which describes itself as “a radical experiment in community world-building,” created by Justin Alanís and his brother J.P. Alanís.  Justin Alanís is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.  Learn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse. Register here.  J.P. went to USC film school and worked in Hollywood, where he quickly became disillusioned.  “I saw really amazing projects get completely ruined because of a regime change,” says J.P. “A whole different person gives notes on a project and it just turns into, like, a pile of [crap].” And the gatekeepers were stifling. He grew tired of seeing “amazing creators not be able to get in rooms because they didn't have the right resume.”  Enter StoryDAO. The idea is not just to scrap the middlemen, but to grow entire IP universes – franchises, series, even blockbusters – that are owned by the community. StoryDAO takes the idea of “industry disruption” to the bleeding edge.  Maybe one artist has an idea for a dystopian sci-fi universe, another creates a Western, a third creates a war epic set in Ancient Rome.  “It quickly became evident to us that you could use these new technologies – tokens, [non-fungible tokens] and [decentralized autonomous organizations – to create new, bottom-up systems that tell stories, where creators can come in and create new intellectual property together,” says Justin Alanís, whose background is in tech entrepreneurship.  StoryDAO started as just a wild idea, but the brothers have now built a seed community of 300 Hollywood-type players (including execs from blue chip firms like WME and UTA). They’re launching their first IP universe in November, and J.P. predicts that in 10 years “the next Star Wars, the next Pokémon will be community-owned.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Your goal is to remake Hollywood on the blockchain. How does that work?  Justin Alanís: There’s all this creative talent out there in Hollywood today, but you have these gatekeepers. And what is Hollywood, really? Hollywood is a network of producers, animators, storytellers, editors, VFX specialists and so on. Ultimately, if you're gonna recreate the fabric of this $100 billion industry on the blockchain by eliminating these middlemen, then you need to have all the same creative forces at play in here as well.  See also: The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin Culture | Opinion  Right. How do you bring those forces together?  Justin: We've already established our early community. It's called our producer token holder community. We had a huge volume of applications, and we hand-selected 300 members of that community. We're talking business leaders, animators, writers, novelists – amazing humans from all around the country who are really passionate about what we're doing.  And that community is a brain trust. We're organizing them into guilds around the different functions of the business, and they’re helping us think through what the tokenomics should be, what the governance model should be and what the first production and the platform should be.  Then, as we get into community-based productions, we'll have a similar methodology where each community-based production will have producers around it that have a unique token. Then all the creatives, the audience and the consumers of each story will contribute in different ways.  So to clarify, you’re first setting up the main DAO. And then eventually you’ll have different communities – one for each “universe” – that each create their own stories?  Justin: So, StoryDAO today is a centralized business with ambitions to eventually decentralize through a token. And each universe within StoryDAO operates as a DAO.  Each DAO then is governed by the NFTs that are part of that universe. All the people who are interested and engaged in that universe have NFTs, and they govern it with the shared treasury. They decide how the intellectual property is expanded. They decide what creations get into “core canon” through the centralized creators, the story architect and the story artist.  So ultimately, the governance of the platform will probably be governed through some sort of token as we decentralize in the future.  You’ve created this “producer token holder community” of 300 people who know the business. And they’ll help decide what stories make the cut. But critics might say, aren’t these just the new versions of Hollywood “suits”? The new gatekeepers? How has anything really changed?  J.P.: I think it's part of our plan of progressive decentralization, right? The goal is to be this completely open platform where anyone can come on and create the basis for a new narrative universe. We want to create the platform for them to do it. What's the right way to create that platform? To start, we have to build the platform with the centralized team, and we have to think about how we maintain the quality of those productions. So, we're starting with our own.  And then we want to turn this over. We want to make this a public good, essentially. We want this to be a platform for everyone to be able to come onboard. This is all part of our plan for progressive decentralization.  Justin: Even the producer token community, right now, is actively discussing how and when to open up membership.  Read more: The Balance Between Art and IP Theft in NFT Culture | Opinion  What’s the format of the content you’ll be producing? Movies? TV?  J.P.: So, it's a new format. The idea for our first productions is for them to be very transmedia, so that they're sort of medium-agnostic. You can weave together a narrative through a tapestry of different mediums.  What does that mean exactly?  J.P.: When we talk about native Web3 storytelling, we think of it as transmedia. So, maybe the first piece of that story is told in prose and art. But maybe the second piece is told in a narrative podcast. Maybe that third piece is a short-form video. Maybe that fourth piece is something else, but they're all weaved together so it's very easily digestible, and you can consume all of it on the platform.  Interesting. Why are you going this route?  J.P.: We’re going to be an IP incubation platform. And there are so many creators that create in different mediums, right? There's comic book creators, there's writers, there's people who do Claymation in their basement. We don't want the platform to be restrictive. So when someone comes in with a community project and they want it to be an audio experience, the platform should be able to broadcast that audio experience in a really engaging way.  We're building our first stories as transmedia properties because we want to really open the aperture of what's possible on the platform.  How do you kick all of this off? How do you create the first “universe”?  Justin: From a content and production perspective, to start we're seeding the platform with our first production. We’re partnering with A-list Hollywood creators, and we're launching that in mid-November.  The idea is that they are the story architect and the story artist and they are the central creators of that first universe. The story architect is putting together a world bible. We’re now creating the beats of what that first universe will look like, and we're weaving NFTs into the actual storyline and the story process itself.  People will be able to experience the story through the NFTs. If I have an NFT, I can do certain things and actions that actually interact with the characters in the story. The NFTs are gamified. They become an immersive piece of the story.  Interesting. How are people viewing and consuming content on StoryDAO? Is it on the blockchain?  Justin: There are really two sides to the platform. There's this social network side of the creators and producers, and then there's a consumption side of the platform where people can have a lean-back experience and really just consume almost like a visual novel, where it’s all these different mediums.  The distribution is going to happen through our platform, but we'll also use existing distribution channels. We think that given our connections to Hollywood, we’ll get licensing deals with Netflix and the existing distributors of the world, and we’ll have this feedback loop. Then all of a sudden somebody sees a premium movie or a TV show on Netflix and they say, ""Wow, this was created by StoryDAO. Okay. Let me see what StoryDAO is."" And they start to get involved.  How many of these universes will you have? Is the idea like five or 10 or something?  J.P.: A thousand.  Wait. Really?  J.P.: A thousand.  How could you possibly scale that?  Justin: It probably evolves a bit like some other accelerators out there, right? If you look at the original days of how Netflix started with its content, you start with unique pieces of IP. Then you bring in new IP through community. You grow it gradually and make sure that the content is high quality and you continually expand, right?  As the automation gets better, as the community gets deeper, as the funding patterns get more embedded you can go from 10 to 20 to 40 to 50 to fully open at some point. So the idea here is that if you have enough content in the system and the network is working the way it's supposed to, you can have an infinite number of projects.  For all of these community-based story projects, I keep bumping up against the same thing. How do you deal with the fact that “communities” are generally pretty lousy at making art? Usually art needs to come from an artist, not the crowd.  J.P.: You're absolutely right. And it's something that we thought a lot about. A lot of projects that you're seeing [like this] are designed so there’s complete community decision-making. I think that takes away the role of the auteur. And if I know what creates a great story, it is a centralized vision. So that's what we're creating around all of these. We have central creative teams that are in charge of creative decisions for all of these DAOs.  Give us a prediction. If this shakes out the way you’re hoping, how could media and entertainment look different in five or 10 years?  J.P.: In five years, someone will have created a new piece of IP that is culturally resonant that they never would've had the ability to do so had StoryDAO not been around. And it [will be] someone who never came from the Hollywood system.  And in 10 years?  J.P.: In 10 years I feel like the entire landscape of Hollywood has changed. In the same way that streaming came in and really disrupted things, we want ownership of IP to be disrupted completely.  We want fans to be co-owners of the biggest franchises in the world. If you’re a fan, you're not just treated as a consumer. You are an owner, you are a decision maker, you are a piece of what this is. We think that creates deeper levels of engagement, deeper levels of fandom. And so we think that the next “Star Wars,” the next Pokemon will be community-owned in 10 years.  Justin: And that really looks like a vibrant social network where people build reputation on the platform, they build an identity on a platform, and they start to create and have connections on the platform. And when you have a really vibrant network that works well, then new and interesting creative expressions will emanate, and new voices will emanate.  Best of luck to you.

42435013,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGniYN,1665607544,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Trades Higher Amid Muted Expectations for Next Inflation Reading,"Price Action  The two bellwethers within the crypto landscape traded higher on Wednesday as bitcoin and ether rose 0.42% and 1.34%, respectively.  Bitcoin (BTC) trading volume continues to fall below its 20-day moving average, highlighting a decline in activity. The trend also indicates that markets will continue to trade in a range for the foreseeable future. BTC began the 13:00 UTC (9:00 a.m. ET) hour testing $19,150 before reverting to its current level.  BTC’s price is down 1.65% thus far in October, indicating the overall lack of volatility. Historically, October has been a strong month for BTC daily returns, previously averaging a 0.57% daily gain, dating to 2014.  Ether (ETH) was recently changing hands at just below $1,300, a more than 1% gain. Volume once again fell short of its 20-day average, marking the 12th consecutive day this has occurred. ETH may find difficulty moving past current levels, as puts (i.e., the option to sell ETH) exceed calls (the option to purchase ETH), by two to one at the $1,300 strike price.  In broader crypto markets, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, fell 0.90%.  Macro View  In macroeconomic news, investors will be eyeing Thursday’s CPI report, which is expected to show annual inflation increasing 8.1%. “Core” inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to increase to 6.4%.  Oil prices are likely to increase following OPEC’s decision last week to reduce oil production. A rift between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia could create additional ripples in energy markets.  Inflation stems from an increased money supply, but higher energy prices resulting from lower oil supply also contribute to rising prices.  Higher inflation will likely lead to the U.S. central bank continuing its recent policy of steep interest rate hikes, slowing economic growth and curbing demand for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies.  OPEC’s decision to reduce production signals the organization is protecting itself against an expected slowing of the global economy. Much of Europe is already in recession or nearing one. On Wednesday, Great Britain reported its economy declined 0.3% in August, versus expectations for a 0.1% expansion.  Latest Prices  ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): 940.65 +0.5%        ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,136 +0.6%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,297 +0.9%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,577.03 −0.3%        ● Gold: $1,681 per troy ounce +0.1%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.90% −0.04        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC Trades in Narrow Range on Eve of Inflation Report  BTC followed a familiar theme on Wednesday, trading in a narrow range on low volume ahead of macroeconomic data.  BTC’s daily chart shows an “inside day,” which is when the current day’s high price dips below the previous day’s while the current day’s low price is higher than the prior day’s.  Wednesday’s price range falls completely within Tuesday's. An inside day can signal uncertainty from market participants specific to price direction. This is also the second inside day within the most recent seven days because it occurred on Sunday as well.  The ongoing lack of volatility and price direction leaves little room for traders who look to profit from price movement. Traders may find some hope in long bouts of low activity because increased price turbulence often follows. How long the activity remains slow remains uncertain.  Currently, derivative markets imply that insurance is being purchased on both sides of the market. Spikes in purchased call options are seen at the $19,250 and $20,000 strike prices, while similar spikes in purchased put options are present at the $19,000 and $18,500 strike prices.  There is no discernible trend within BTC’s chart other than sideways at the moment. Traders with a bearish bias who lean on chart patterns, however, may identify the formation of a “descending triangle” between Oct. 4 and Wednesday.  A descending triangle is a technical chart pattern that is often interpreted as bearish. It occurs when investors are willing to sell at increasingly lower lows, with diminished demand to meet the falling prices.  The 10-day moving average for BTC recently crossed below the 20-day moving average, which would be considered bearish as well. Still, the lack of volume implies a wait-and-see approach, despite the signs of downward pressure.

42435003,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGniSr,1665604800,Canadian Self-Regulatory Agency Approves First Crypto-Native Investment Dealer,"Toronto-based crypto exchange Coinsquare became a member of Canada’s top self-regulatory organization (SRO) – the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) – on Thursday, making it the first crypto-native platform to join that body.  In addition to granting Coinsquare membership, IIROC also greenlit the exchange’s investment dealer registration and gave approval to operate as a regulated alternative trading system (ATS) in the future.  Though Coinsquare is the first exchange to join IIROC, it is unlikely to be the last. In March 2021, the Canadian Securities Administrators issued a public notice informing crypto exchanges they needed to register with a securities regulator if they wanted to keep serving Canadian customers, triggering a rush to comply with regulatory requirements.  Coinsquare, however, began the long process of becoming an IIROC member before it was compelled to do so. Katriana Prokopy, Coinsquare’s chief legal officer and head of regulatory affairs, told CoinDesk the exchange began pursuing regulatory approval two years ago.  As a member of IIROC, Coinsquare will undergo rigorous audits and oversight to ensure it remains in compliance with regulatory requirements – something Prokopy said could be a comfort to investors, especially in the wake of high-profile collapses of crypto exchanges, including Celsius Network.  “Becoming an IIROC dealer and member of IIROC, it gives clients the security that they’re dealing with an intermediary, a securities dealer, with all the sorts of protections and oversight that they’re familiar with when they trade traditional assets,” Prokopy said. “And, heretofore, that has not been the case.”  There is, however, one important bit of coverage Coinsquare’s clients won’t get through its IIROC membership – protection of their crypto assets from the exchange’s potential insolvency.  Members of IIROC automatically become members of the Canadian Investor Protection Fund, which offers limited protection for property held by a member fund on behalf of investors if the member becomes insolvent.

Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) – one side of the negotiations over Congress’ leading stablecoin bill – says the bipartisan talks are ongoing and that he hopes lawmakers can still settle on final legislation in the “coming months.”  The three-way talks with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, and the Treasury Department have run into a number of sticking points, according to McHenry, the committee’s senior Republican. But he said Wednesday he’s hopeful the talks will end with a law that would establish rules for how stablecoins – tokens such as Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC that are tied to steady assets such as the dollar – can operate in the U.S.  Such a bill would mark the first significant U.S. crypto oversight measure.  So far, the points the House members have had trouble agreeing on including how assets are held, the definition of a crypto wallet and which federal agency might regulate stablecoin issuers. But their common ground includes an agreement to require issuers to have one-to-one reserves backing the tokens, which are often used to buy and sell more volatile cryptocurrencies.  “We agree on all the components of what the asset is,” McHenry said at DC Fintech Week. “We’ve come up with a pretty ugly baby. It is a baby, nonetheless.”  McHenry, who could take over the committee as chairman next year if Republicans win a majority in the House of Representatives, said it has already been “a sign of hope that you can have complex, difficult policymaking in the midst of all this chaos.”  “I’m optimistic that we will come to terms, and I appreciate the trade-offs that my Democratic counterparts were willing to make,” he said.",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,REGULATION | USDT | USDC,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/12/key-us-lawmaker-says-talks-continue-over-ugly-baby-bill-to-oversee-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5fcf7999292da34ff31bccf445d4790aa932cc78-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new funding is part of an ongoing Series C investing round in the company. Of the $196 million, $181 million came from new and existing shareholders, with the rest coming from a convertible loan note.  The valuation of the firm was not known, and the company reported a loss of $16 million in 2021, up significantly from $4.1 million in 2020. Copper didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  CoinDesk reported this summer that Copper was looking to close a funding round soon that had been delayed from 2021. At the time, the company was looking to be valued at around $2 billion, down from the $3 billion valuation it was reportedly seeking in November 2021.

The Hermit Kingdom’s alleged proficiency in pilfering billions of dollars from crypto protocols has spawned a new category of Kim Jong-Un-focused comedy on Crypto Twitter, the industry’s sometimes moldy water cooler. These memes cast North Korean hackers as master strategists dutifully draining decentralized finance (DeFi) in their race to nuke the world.  Jokes or no, they’re not entirely wrong. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) has raided crypto exchanges, cross-chain token bridges and companies of over $1 billion in crypto this year alone, according to research firm Chainalysis.  Read more: US Officials Tie North Korea’s ‘Lazarus’ Hackers to $625M Crypto Theft  These hacks have real-world implications: Officials have said the money helps fund North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. But in crypto, too, Kim’s shadow looms larger than ever: His hackers’ sloppy laundering of the Ronin hack through mixing service Tornado Cash led to the U.S. government’s first-ever sanctioning of a crypto protocol.  North Korea’s crypto heists stretch back to at least 2017. But it wasn’t until late 2020 that memesters started memorializing them, said DeGen Ping, a pseudonymous market commentator who riffs on Crypto Twitter.  “Then it revived with the Axie hack earlier this year,” Ping said in a Twitter message, referring to Axie Infinity. Now it’s full steam ahead: “People are waking up to the trend.”  The memesters aren’t waiting around for an official declaration of blame, Ping said. Now, every new hack and heist fosters new potential for fresh DPRK content. And there are a lot of hacks and heists from which to choose. One tongue-in-cheek bingo board suggests crypto suffers at least one colossal screwup a month.  “Nobody knows for sure but safe to assume [DPRK is behind it] until proven otherwise,” Ping said.  In the past seven days two episodes have sparked new DPRK memes: BNB Chain’s $500 million drain (a hack), and Solana-based DeFi exchange Mango Market’s $100 million loss (an exploit).  It may not be so far afield to drop the BNB heist at Kim’s feet; the incredible complexity that went into spoofing that Binance-linked blockchain suggests a state actor is at work. But the Mango drain, which saw an attacker manipulate the price of MNGO using tokens secured from a centralized (and thus know-your-customer compliant) exchange, is almost certainly not.  That made no nevermind for Crypto Twitter. In the hours following the heist some Crypto Twitterati speculated (using memes) that Lazarus Group hackers were to blame.  At the root of these memes may be the same weird mix of the professional and the grotesque that Will Gottsegen, CoinDesk's former culture reporter, says is the signature of Crypto Twitter.  “It's sort of like, both the dumbest and the most important platform in crypto,” he said.  On Crypto Twitter, traders can chase funding, influence, clout and fame by flaunting their wit, he said. Memes are a sort of currency in this space. DPRK offers a chance to relate crypto’s in-jokes to national security themes that actually matter to the world.  “In a way the DPRK memes are Crypto Twitter’s attempt at public intellectualism,” he said.  Ascribing such highfalutin themes to, well, s**tposting, isn’t accepted by all. One of the most prolific of these posters, the Twitter account for investor CMS Holdings, thinks the spate of North Korea memes is a function of people having literally nothing better to do.  “Think it's really just dull markets,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BNB,ASIA | AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | BNB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/12/crypto-hacks-fuel-memes-of-north-korea-blockchains-biggest-baddie,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d328ab6d9f01ef4c7a2f13bd77d67412c319524f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Barr, who took on the role as vice chair of supervision at the U.S. Federal Reserve earlier this summer, said that risk management is a key issue for regulators, even if they note the possible benefits of different types of innovation.  “The range of options available for dealing with emerging technologies and those benefits are solid,” Barr said. “One of them is just risk identification, so we can enunciate to the world that we see a set of risks and that they should be looked at carefully. And that has an actual effect on behavior.”  Barr, who gave a speech on fintech innovation prior to a back-and-forth with event organizer Chris Brummer, touched on stablecoin regulation, a new real-time payment system called FedNow, tokenizing bank liabilities and central bank digital currencies during his session.  In places he appeared to echo Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu in cautioning that some of the advances in financial technology innovation might create potential harms.  “Crypto assets have grown rapidly in the last several years, both in market capitalization and in reach,"" said Barr. ""But recent fissures in these markets have shown that some crypto assets are rife with risks, including fraud, theft, manipulation and even exposure to money-laundering activities ... Crypto asset-related activity, both outside and inside supervised banks, requires oversight that includes safeguards to ensure that crypto service providers are subject to similar regulations as other financial services providers.”  Still, he added, while regulators do need to provide clarity, they also can’t be overly prescriptive.  “I think particularly in a very fast evolving space, you want to use all those tools because if you just write the rules, first of all, you're going to be late,"" he said.

3853556,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=248014,1665603945,The Benefits Of Liquid Staking For Institutions And Corporations,"Staking is a core component of decentralized finance (DeFi). It means that users typically get rewarded between 4% - 8% for locking up their coins. The current banking model no longer offers any real form of interest for deposits, so the benefits of this kind of staking are clear and obvious, as it rewards people for their contributions instead of taking from them. But Liquid Staking takes it one step further. Liquid Staking was initially created by Ankr, a Web3 infrastructure firm that helps blockchain startups grow and expand together. Ankr further offers a seamless point of entry into Web3 and DeFi with a large suite of protocols. While the benefits of DeFi are obvious from the perspective of traders, investors, and entrepreneurs, it can also be of huge advantage to institutions and corporations. What Is Liquid Staking? With regular staking, users earn rewards on their deposits. This works on proof-of-stake blockchains such as Ethereum, and cannot be done on proof-of-work blockchains such as Bitcoin. Most blockchains are now proof-of-stake or delegated-proof-of-stake, though there are many different models being tested out. Liquid Staking goes a step further than regular staking. With Liquid Staking, you get the rewards from staking, but are given a derivative token in return. For instance, you get the rewards for staking MATIC and are then given an aMATICb derivative token. This derivative token can then be used for other ...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | ICO,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/the-benefits-of-liquid-staking-for-institutions-and-corporations/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
42421237,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsGj,1665603398,This Native American Tribe Leader Is Bringing Salmon Restoration to the Metaverse,"Having been born into the salmon restoration movement, Pom, a Native American tribe leader in Northern California, is staking out how to use blockchain to revive the native species of Chinook salmon his community once relied on.  To do so, Pom and his team created a video game called Salmon Journeys on Decentraland, where users can catch Chinook salmon to win an exclusive non-fungible token (NFT) by Sawalmen, a Web3 entity that represents Indigenous spiritual values and raises funds for restoration efforts and the landback movement.  Salmon Journeys is a finalist in CoinDesk's Web3athon organized with CRADL. The winners are announced at the I.D.E.A.S. conference October 18 and 19.  Pom’s goal with this game is to raise funds as well as awareness for actual salmon restoration efforts, he said. The game is part of an ongoing hackathon event, tied to CoinDesk's I.D.E.A.S. conference.  “Since the Shasta Dam was built 75 years ago, the salmon have been unable to return to their home waters in our ancestral watershed near Mt. Shasta, California,” Pom said. He added he's in discussions with Maori tribes in New Zealand to bring to California a related genetic descendant of the Chinook.  See also: Everyrealm Eyes Communities of Scale in the Metaverse  Pom, who also goes by his English name Michael Preston, wants the team’s NFTs to reflect the ecological situation in Northern California and to get the message out about the importance of salmon restoration. He’s not the only one focused on repairing the waterways, but said other salmon pilot projects on the McCloud River have faced a lack of funding.  Crypto is his way of bootstrapping efforts.  Pom first had the idea to combine blockchain with salmon restoration in March 2020. He wrote a rough draft of a white paper, which Pom calls a “Redpaper,” and earlier this year attended Web3athon, a crypto hackathon presented by CoinDesk and Crypto Research and Design Lab.  The Web3athon has helped Pom and his team get their project off the ground and into the spaces where they hope to gain more support and funding for Salmon Journey's full buildout.  Through the Web3athon Discord channel he met teammate Ayush Arora, a software engineer based in India, who is integral in making the Decentraland video game.  ""It was hard at first for me. I'm like, wow, how are we going to do this?"" Pom said. In Pom's eyes, the game is a great way to reach younger generations who have the power to make a great impact in salmon restoration efforts.  “The goal is to have this game tell our story in as many metaverses as possible so that people will hear about our efforts, have fun playing a cool game, win and gain value back for themselves, and support actual salmon returns to the McCloud River,” Pom said.  As a candidate in the Web3athon, Pom thinks he has a pretty solid minimum-viable product and a good chance of becoming the winner.  ""We are persistent and we believe in what we're doing. We're just gonna do this, whether or not we're part of the hackathon.""

42435012,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGniXl,1665597672,US Consumer Price Index for September Could Provide Push for Bitcoin to Break Out of Its Recent Range,"A U.S. inflation report due Thursday might be the catalyst that finally snaps bitcoin (BTC) out of an unusually long spell of uncharacteristically low price volatility, analysts say.  The Labor Department on Thursday is expected to report that the core consumer price index (CPI) accelerated to a year-on-year pace of 6.5% in September, from August's 6.3%, according to FactSet. This “core” inflation rate strips out the impact of volatile food and energy prices; the “headline” CPI, which includes food and energy items, is already running hot above 8%.  Read More: Bitcoin Rebounds to Over $19K After Plunge Triggered by Hot Inflation Report  A core CPI of 6.5% would be the highest in four decades – helping to explain the alarm among Federal Reserve officials who have been attempting to restore price stability by tightening monetary policy – and in the process, putting downward pressure on prices of risky assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies.  Analysts at the big U.S. bank JPMorgan say a too-hot CPI would put equities at risk of a 5% tumble.  Depending on the CPI number, both equities and risk assets like cryptocurrencies could move either 3% up or down, according to Florian Giovannacci, head of trading for Covario.  “A higher/lower CPI could easily give us a -3%/+3% on equity, and risk-on assets such as cryptocurrency would react instantly with high correlation,” said Giovannacci.  Bitcoin has been trading in a range between $18,000-$22,400 since the start of September. So the inflation report could be the push the cryptocurrency needs to break out.  The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is performing similarly to 2018, when in the period of March-November bitcoin’s price remained around $6,000 and people thought the market had already bottomed, according to Pablo Jodar, a crypto analyst at GenTwo.  “Soon after, it dropped another 50% to $3,000,” said Jodar. “It stayed at that level for several months until the bull market started again.”  “If the CPI data is strong tomorrow, which I think it will be, bitcoin will see another drop to $17,000,” said Jodar.  Conversely, any decrease in the CPI could generate a big rally for the crypto market.  “This is against the backdrop of extreme bearishness in sentiment indicators and positioning, and the rally should last into the start of the Q3 earning season,” said Nauman Sheikh, head of protocol and treasury management at early-stage VC investment and asset manager firm Wave Financial.  Sheikh says he sees a greater risk that the inflation number comes in slightly above expectations.  “For me, the surprise scenario is if we have softer numbers and the market is primed to rally in that scenario,"" Sheikh said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/12/us-consumer-price-index-for-september-could-provide-push-for-bitcoin-to-break-out-of-its-recent-range,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/196a178af5d22874394e6f1fc7fcf26b9878e0ea-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The CoinDesk Market Index rose 0.59% over the past 24 hours. At press time, bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, slipped 0.12% after coming back from the low of $18,971 earlier in the day. Ether (ETH) was up 0.27%, trading below $1,300.  Investors remained in a wait-and-see mode following Wednesday's higher-than-expected U.S. producer price index (PPI) data, a measure of the price of goods sold by manufacturers. Despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's fight against inflation, wholesale prices rose 0.4% for September, compared with the Dow Jones estimate for a 0.2% increase.  Global macro sentiment has driven correlations across assets “back to extremes,” according to QCP Capital’s note. BTC’s correlation with equities and gold is “at all-time highs.” By contrast, the U.S. dollar’s correlation with bitcoin – historically an inverse relationship – is “at all-time lows.”  Stefan Rust, founder of economic data aggregator Truflation, said the markets would probably revert to a downward trend as the Federal Reserve continues its strategy of tightening monetary policy.  “In the past two years, crypto has been highly correlated to stocks and dependent on global fiat liquidity, so we can expect further drops or at least increased daily volatility around the release of the CPI figures tomorrow,” he told CoinDesk via an email.

42394499,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw96EH,1665596045,Crypto for Good: How to Donate Crypto and Who Accepts It,"While some people devote their lives to hoarding crypto in the hopes that “number go up” forever, others are eager to spread the wealth to worthy causes. Consequently, plenty of non-governmental organizations (NGO) and charities are now more than happy to accept crypto from the newly rich and distribute it to those in need, encapsulating the “WAGMI” or “we're all gonna make it” mantra so central in crypto.  Many such organizations popped their heads above the parapets after Russia invaded Ukraine, and over 60 million dollars in crypto have been donated to Ukraine. Indeed, Ukraine itself launched crypto wallets to receive donations and use them for supplies. But how can you donate crypto, and which charities accept them?  How to donate crypto  You need to own crypto before you can donate it. You can buy crypto on a centralized exchange like Binance or Coinbase, or on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap. You can also earn crypto from a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. You could, for instance, lend out cryptocurrencies you earn on decentralized lending platform Aave and donate the interest you receive.  Donating crypto is usually a case of transferring funds from your wallet to the beneficiary. That’ll often be an NGO or non-government organization. You can transfer funds from most exchanges, or via a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask. Note: Watch out for so-called charity scam coins – cryptocurrency projects that claim they’ll donate proceeds to charities before absconding with funds.  Read More: 4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto  Why donate crypto?  A lot of cryptos are infamous for their volatility, and if you want to transfer the value you hold today you might be better off donating cash – just in case the market crashes by the time your beneficiary wants to use your crypto to buy stuff.  However, some charities welcome price volatility, considering it a way to increase the value of donations over time. For example, a non-profit called charity:water is holding crypto donations it raised in 2021 until at least 2025 in a charitable bitcoin (BTC) trust, for instance. UNICEF’s crypto fund operates in a similar way.  There are other benefits. Direct crypto donations could help you avoid capital gains taxes on sales, and you could even be entitled to a tax deduction if you’re donating to an established charity.  Some fundraisers take place within the crypto economy and make use of decentralized fundraising methods, such as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Endaoment, for instance, is a charitable organization that intends to eventually become an Ethereum-based decentralized philanthropic institution. It’s also common for non-fungible token (NFT) projects to allocate a budget to charity donations. Psychedelics Anonymous is an NFT project that donates money to an organization that provides therapy using psychedelic drugs. (Note: the project itself isn’t a charitable organization.)  Public blockchains are also transparent and you can – up until funds are converted to cash – trace the flow of money, potentially reducing corruption. (However, given that most charities convert crypto donations into fiat currency and then use them to buy goods “off-chain,” this has limitations.) Crypto donations are also private – donors need not be identified outside of their wallet address.  Who accepts crypto?  Dedicated crypto NGOs  One of the most prominent brands for crypto giving is The Giving Block, a company that makes it easy for nonprofits to fundraise crypto. It provides services to nonprofits focused on specific causes, like the environment or water quality, and is also aligned with impact index funds that, in a stroke of utilitarianism, disburse your funds to projects they have determined will relieve the most suffering. Crypto for Charity also facilitates crypto donations to more than 55,000 U.S. non-profits, and Daffy supports more than 1.5 million organizations.  Numerous crypto projects have their own charity arms. The Binance Charity Foundation claims to have donated about $25 million, plus another $10 million to a humanitarian relief fund for the war in Ukraine. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Polygon was among several projects to raise funds for hotspots. Gitcoin runs funding rounds for open-source crypto projects and frequently matches charitable donations.  Major NGOs and charity funds  Plenty of charities accept crypto donations these days, including the Electronic Freedom Foundation, UNICEF, Greenpeace and the Human Rights Foundation.  Since 2015, Fidelity has operated a donor-advised bitcoin fund, which allows donors to send bitcoin to charity. Fidelity uses Coinbase to sell the converted bitcoin for cash, but the structure of Fidelity’s fund allows donors to avoid capital gains taxes on sales.  Governments also accept crypto donations. The Ukrainian government, for instance, launched a fundraiser by listing crypto wallets on its Twitter account.

DeFi is a new financial ecosystem that is being developed on top of blockchain technology, allowing users to earn revenue by providing liquidity to the market. The main idea behind DeFi is to make finance more accessible, transparent, and efficient for all parties involved in it. Many blockchains thrive on a Proof-of-Stake mechanism, where token holders participate in the blockchain by helping validate transactions, run nodes, and secure the network. Participating in the network&apos;s activity often yields certain returns. Enterprises Globally Will Take Full Advantage of DeFi Staking The benefits of staking are not limited just to the individual. It can also provide a lot of benefits to an enterprise. Staking is a process where an individual or company locks its crypto holdings for a specific period of time. Oftentimes staking will take place in order to secure the network, with some of the network gas fees going to stakes. This process provides additional revenue for both parties involved in the transaction either way, which is why it will become so popular among enterprises. With large amounts of capital, enterprises could earn a considerable amount of interest. Staking offers a much higher APY than a traditional savings account, sometimes over double digits.

42434999,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGniQP,1665593739,US Senator Warren Leads Congressional Group's Probe Into Bitcoin Mining Energy Use in Texas,"A group of seven Democratic lawmakers in Washington, D.C., led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, are looking into the energy usage and carbon emissions of the bitcoin mining industry in Texas as well as the impact on the grid and local consumers.  In a letter Wednesday addressed to Pablo Vegas, the CEO of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the group expressed concerns that bitcoin mining's enormous demand for energy in Texas is straining the state's grid, adversely impacting consumers and U.S. climate goals. ERCOT manages the Texas electricity grid, which operates independently from the rest of the country.  ""Crypto mining is adding significant demand to an already unreliable grid [and] contributing to the global climate crisis,"" claim the lawmakers, who further assert miners are benefitting at the expense of consumers from ""huge ERCOT subsidies in the form of demand response agreements.""  So-called demand response programs mean that when demand for energy across the grid is high, miners power down their operations in exchange for energy credits that they can use in the future, thus releasing power back to the struggling grid. About 1 GW of mining powered down this summer as heatwaves swept across the state.  The Democratic lawmakers see things differently: ""In simple terms, the bitcoin miners make money from mining that produces major strains on the electric grid' and during peak demand when the profitability of continuing to mine decreases, they then collect subsidies in the form of demand response payments when they shut off their mining operations and do nothing.""  Bitcoin miners flocked to Texas following a ban on the industry in China last year, then the largest hub for crypto mining in the world, due to its seemingly abundant energy and friendly regulation.  There are now about 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of crypto mining in Texas, with another 5 GW set to connect to the grid by the end of 2023, according to the local industry association and lobbying group, Texas Blockchain Council (TBC). ERCOT has said that it has 33 GW worth of applications from miners on its desk, but the TBC said that includes some double counting. At any rate, ERCOT has slowed down application approvals as it tries to figure out in detail how miners can be integrated in the grid.  Besides Warren, the letter was signed by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), as well as Representatives Al Green (D-Texas), Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich).  It's but the latest salvo from Warren against bitcoin and the miners over environmental and other concerns. Last year, she spoke out against Greenidge Generation, a natural gas-powered bitcoin miner in New York state, which eventually saw its air permits denied in July.

42435005,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGniSF,1665593087,Crypto Think Tank Coin Center Sues US Treasury Over Tornado Cash Sanctions,"Think tank Coin Center is alleging the U.S. Treasury Department’s sweeping sanctions against crypto mixer Tornado Cash harmed Americans and their ability to transact privately using the Ethereum network.  Coin Center filed a lawsuit against the Treasury Department and the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), its sanctions watchdog, on Wednesday, marking the second suit the advocacy group has filed against the Treasury Department, as well as the second lawsuit filed against Treasury over its Tornado Cash sanctions.  OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash in August, claiming North Korean hackers had laundered hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of crypto through the mixer since its launch. Something like 20% of Tornado Cash’s overall transaction volume was tied to one hack or another, the federal government alleged. The crypto industry has opposed the move, pointing to the fact that OFAC does not normally sanction software and the fact that Tornado Cash does not have any central operator.  There are legitimate uses for individuals to use privacy-enhancing tools like Tornado Cash, the suit claimed, and OFAC’s sanctions against the privacy mixer – which works by pooling funds to obfuscate the sender of any given transaction – mean that these individuals now effectively expose their entire transaction history to anyone looking at the network data.  “An order effectively requiring Defendants to decriminalize use of the 20 Tornado Cash addresses would allow Plaintiffs to conduct their legitimate activities with some measure of anonymity, use their preferred software tool without fear of penalties, and engage in important expressive associations,” the suit said. “Judicial relief would also serve the public interest by averting harm to Tornado Cash users who are United States persons, to Ethereum as a freedom and privacy enhancing technology, and to the important sector of the economy that depends on Ethereum.”  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and OFAC Director Andrea Gacki are also named as defendants. Patrick O’Sullivan, a Florida-based software developer, David Hoffman, a New York-based investor, and an unnamed Ukraine supporter are other plaintiffs tied to the suit.  Hoffman was “dusted,” meaning someone sent him a small amount of ETH after Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, the suit claimed.  “Ethereum users like Mr. Hoffman have no ability to reject incoming transfers. So the criminalization of Tornado Cash empowered someone else to implicate Mr. Hoffman and force reporting obligations on him by causing him to receive an asset from a sanctioned entity,” the suit said. “And it has licensed anyone else who wishes to harass or inconvenience Mr. Hoffman to continue to send crypto assets through Tornado Cash to Mr. Hoffman’s publicly known addresses, each time triggering potential liability and reporting obligations.”  Coin Center filed another lawsuit against Treasury earlier this year, alleging that a tax reporting rule enacted into law last year as part of a broader infrastructure bill is “unconstitutional.” The provision would require taxpayers to collect and report personally identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers, if they receive over $10,000 in cryptocurrency.  The federal government has until Nov. 7, 2022, to file a response.  Another lawsuit, funded by crypto exchange Coinbase, takes aim at the Tornado Cash sanction effort itself.  Like the Coin Center-backed suit, the Coinbase-backed lawsuit filed last month alleges OFAC overstepped its legal bounds in designating an “open-source software project” to its sanctions list.  Part of the plaintiffs’ complaint in the Coinbase suit was the fact they could no longer access ether (ETH) they had locked in Tornado Cash, despite being American citizens not accused of wrongdoing.  Last month, Treasury published guidance telling U.S. persons to apply for a license to withdraw their funds.  Treasury declined to comment on the lawsuit.

42421094,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZSaz,1665592659,'I Knew I Was Here to Stay': Talking the Future of Web3 With David Bianchi,"The red carpet can be deceiving. The glamor of Hollywood can mislead. Consider, for example, the case of working actors in television.  “Unless you’re a series regular, you’re not making real money,” says David Bianchi, an actor with over 100 film and TV credits that range from “NCIS” to “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” to “Westworld.” “That’s an important thing to talk about, because I do want to level the playing field.”  These days Bianchi has “made it,” but back when he moved to Los Angeles he had cockroaches in his kitchen, slept on the floor and worked as a bartender for 15 years while cranking out acting gigs. The bartending job was discreetly hidden from his IMDb page but it was crucial for survival.  “I wasn’t gonna turn down $1,500 cash a week, right?” says Bianchi. “To call myself a ‘working actor?’ It’s ridiculous.”  See also: 'I'm a Crypto Guy': Why Steve Aoki Believes in Web3  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bianchi found something he believes will level the playing field for actors and creatives. You can probably guess where this is going.  “Web3, I think, really chops down the barricades,” says Bianchi.  That overall idea might not be new – many have called for Web3 to “disrupt” Hollywood and empower creators. But Bianchi isn’t just speaking in abstractions. In a sense, he’s betting his career on Web3. The founder of Exertion3 (a blockchain production company), Bianchi is executive producing and starring in “Razor,” an upcoming dystopian sci-fi drama about neural implants, coding culture and black-market crimes. It will be released on the blockchain through a partnership with Gala Films.  “Why is the blockchain important?” Bianchi asks. “For the first time in Hollywood history, audiences will be able to actually, tangibly own a motion picture. That’s never been done before.”  This isn’t Bianchi’s first brush with crypto. He’s also a poet who has created a genre he calls “Spinema,” or “spinning cinema through spoken word” – indie and activist art that isn’t exactly Hollywood-friendly. Enter non-fungible tokens. Bianchi minted and sold Spinema NFTs such as “I Can’t Breathe,” designed to bring attention to police brutality and the murder of George Floyd. (The “I Can’t Breathe” NFT was actually bought by MetaKovan, the prolific collector who bought Beeple’s $69 million NFT.)  After that? Bianchi was all-in. “I knew I was here to stay,” says the actor, who spent months in Clubhouse rooms and Discords to immerse himself in Web3 culture. He even begins our Zoom call with a cheery, “Gm, gm!” The man knows the space. Here, he opens up about how Web3 can empower artists, lead to the creation of better content, and unlock a future of media that he calls a “cataclysmic shift.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  The NFT world can be tricky. When you first got started, how’d you navigate it?  At that time I don't think there was anybody in NFTs who was minting entire short-form films as one-of-one pieces of art. I was probably the only one. And I had no idea what I was doing. I was just like, “I got a lot of hustle, I believe in my heart, I believe in this and I'm just down to be a part of whatever the hell is going on.”  I really just asked a lot of open-ended questions. The NFT community was so generous with their time, and they were so available to answer these newb questions. I was blown away by their generosity. It’s incredibly unusual for people in Hollywood to offer their time freely to answer questions and to send me their phone numbers and talk to me.  So when you minted “I Can’t Breathe,” it was bought by MetaKovan. How did that impact you?  Forbes covered the story. I donated all the proceeds to the George Floyd Memorial Foundation. I was able to educate the Floyd Foundation on the values of blockchain and cryptocurrency.  And this is how powerful the NFT community is. The film was seen by [civil rights attorney] Lee Merritt. It was seen by Benjamin Crump [another prominent civil rights attorney]. It was seen by Bridget Floyd. And not only did they see it, out of all the content that the Floyd family received during that period, they said, “This is the one. We want to show this film at the one-year memorial of his passing.”  And I can't tell you how many times I wept, how many times I cried during those Clubhouse rooms. There were 4,000 people and not a dry eye in the room. And for the first time in my entire life, I felt like my work had purpose.  See also: Investing in Web3: Culture and Entertainment  Incredible. And now let’s back up a bit. Can you talk about how your artistic journey entered the world of Web3?  One of the main reasons I came to NFTs is because I was pitching Spinema as a television series, and it got represented by a big agency. When I pitched, everybody unanimously said, “David, we love your passion, we love your idea, we just don't know what to do with it.” Hollywood told me no.  So I said, “Thank you for telling me no. That just gives me a reason to go left or to go right. But I'm not gonna stop moving.”  Then I landed in the NFT community and I met people like you – young, influential, well-to-do, tech-savvy, connected and hungry for high art and purpose. And suddenly the clouds parted and it was almost like Neo in “The Matrix"" when he sees the code and can dodge the bullets and see the matrix.  What was it that you saw, exactly? What became clear to you?  Creator economies. Residual income that artists can earn. The open nature of the blockchain and everything that comes with it. And I knew I was here to stay.  There was nothing that was gonna pull me away from minting and creating NFTs, and creating socially conscious art that talks about who we are as a people, that talks about where we are as a community, that raises the voices of BIPOC people, that raises the voices of the struggle, that raises the voices of the people who don't have voices. I wanna be able to create art that will be discussed in 2100.  That’s a good segue to “Razor.” It will be distributed on the blockchain. How does that work?  The mechanics are still sort of being tested. But what we're playing with is the idea that if you own an NFT then you won't necessarily have to pay to stream to watch.  If you don't own an NFT, then we will either create a PPV [pay per view] model, which will be a nominal fee for a single view or it will be a very low membership rate that will absolutely compete with the major streaming platforms in Web2. So when you're watching the content, you'll actually be watching it from a streaming mechanism.  Read more: Can Starbucks Bring Web3 Into the Mainstream? | Opinion  So it’s going to have Web2 streaming as well?  The Web3 assets that are tethered to “Razor” and the world of “Razor” will be minted as ERC 721 tokens. So you're gonna have NFTs and then you're gonna have the streaming mechanisms.  We'll have an exclusive window of streaming that will be on Gala, and then we will release and do licensing deals in Web2. So that could be Netflix, it could be Hulu, it could be Amazon, it could be HBO Max.  Ah, so if you own an NFT and you watch it on the Gala blockchain, you might get to see it weeks or months before it’s available on Netflix or Hulu or whatever?  Correct.  How else does digital ownership fit into this?  We're going to be minting storyboards, graphic animatics, a lot of digital assets, and giving digital access to the community. But also IRL access to the cast and crew – like table reads, premiers, etc.  I'm even eventually going to be able to NFT three lines in an episode, and I'm gonna bring you [the theoretical NFT holder] in, and set you up with an acting coach and you'll have a trailer. We'll knock on your door and bring you coffee, and you'll become a working actor.  Love it. What’s the timeline on this?  It's aggressive. We’re rolling out our pre-production NFT collection in November. Then we're going into physical production on episodes one through eight in Los Angeles starting in November. We’ll probably have episodes one and two ready to drop around the end of Q1 2023.  Okay, there’s one thing in the world of NFTs, where “scarcity” is prized, that never really gets talked about. All of that innovation sounds great but, ultimately, people need to want to see the show, right? The underlying asset needs to be something compelling, right?  It can't suck.  [Both laugh.]  It can't suck! Exactly. So on top of experimenting with a new Web3 model and platform, do you also feel this added pressure to nail the content?  Oh, man. I mean, look, if I told you that the intimidation wasn't there, I'd be fooling myself and you. Is it terrifying? Sure. But it's exhilarating, right?  The distinction between the fearful man and the courageous man is that the courageous man walks through fear. And I have never shied down from any challenge. I tend to do my best work when my back is up against the wall.  But you're absolutely right. The world of ""Razor"" has to compel you enough that you want to buy into this. Now Gala has a very, very robust community – [among] Gala Games, Gala Music and now Gala Films. And we’re starting to do slow-rollout campaigns where there are thousands of Web3-fluent people who are sort of film buffs, and don’t yet know what we’re doing.  So for us, community-building is just as important as pre-production, which is why we’re doing a pre-production NFT drop – we want to engage with our audience as early as humanly possible to keep them a part of the process.  Getting the Discord alive, answering questions, allowing people to really chime in and weigh in on what they like, what they don’t like. Because that’s a fundamental component of a community of Web3 – we really get to hear their voices.  That all makes sense, but how does this tack back to the idea of the underlying content and it needing to be compelling?  One of the things Hollywood doesn't do very well is that they make movies and then they test them and they hope they work. You know, we just saw the $90 million ""Batgirl"" get trashed, like, it just didn't get released. They completed it. But what ended up happening was they realized they overshot the budget and the movie was gonna be lost no matter which way you slice it and dice it. Unfortunately, their box office metrics showed that minority-led pictures usually don't break $25 million. So they threw it away, they trashed it.  Instead, what we’ll be doing is releasing assets, and we're gonna be measuring the pulse of the community.  Ah, so the idea is that you’re sort of working in collaboration with the community from the jump, improving the chances that it lands? Got it. So tell us about “Razor.”  I wanted it to be something that was existential, gritty and character-driven, and taps into socially conscious notions of what we are as a society, who we are as human beings and where we are going as a society.  It’s a dark, somewhat dystopian look at the world of neural implants, code culture and the underbelly of black-market crime. It revolves around a character named Razor, and it was actually inspired by Elon Musk's Neuralink Technology.  What happens when you can create a neural device that you can implant into your cerebrum that can tap into all the information of the World Wide Web instantaneously? And what does that do to the mind?  Great hook. I’m in. So in the spirit of sci-fi, give us a few real-world predictions. Let’s imagine that it’s five years from now and Web3 in film and TV really takes off, really finds mass adoption. What does that future look like? How would it be different?  It's a great question. I think about this a lot.  First, from a work-model perspective, there will be a work system where – whether you’re a gaffer, an electrician, a [production assistant], a cinematographer, an actor or whatever – your work portal will have your profile and your experience tethered to the blockchain. Your digital wallet will be there. All of your tax paperwork will be there.  When you come on set, it's completely paperless, it's moneyless. All your pay is authenticated on the blockchain. Everything happens seamlessly. I see the unions, the Screen Actors Guild, I see IATSE (they may not like this). Because what does transparency do? Guess what, you can't cook the books anymore.  I’m eventually going to start building this.  Interesting. How about a prediction from the consumers’ perspective?  We’re in a generation where the idea of digital ownership is still quite foreign, right? We grew up in a world where somebody climbs to the top of Mount Everest and takes a great picture and we think, “I got it for free, why would I pay for it?” But the question of these assets is, why wouldn't you pay for it, right?  So now we're headed into this new world where Gen Z is gonna be very accustomed to digital ownership and transparency. I think it’s going to be demanded that people have digital ownership of assets tethered to the TV shows and the movies that they like to watch.  How about a prediction for distribution?  At the exhibition level, for the movie theater-goer, there will be NFTs that will be your monthly movie pass and you’ll have credits for popcorn. You're gonna be able to have all these [digital] collectibles and memorabilia.  But people aren't gonna call them NFTs five years from now. It's just gonna be like, ""I just bought some stuff."" Like, nobody says, “I’m going on the information highway to look for a movie ticket.” I'm just hopping online, I'm buying a movie ticket, right?  100%. I agree it’s likely that the acronym NFT eventually dies, even as NFTs get more prominent. One final prediction?  Now people are very tricky about the acronyms, on whether it’s [called] AR or VR, but I’m thinking of something like HoloLens technology, where it’s what I consider “extended reality.”  I’m wearing this device on my face so my hands are free, and I have extensions of metaverse elements in my physical reality. I could tell if my dog is chewing up my couch and I'm not blindsided.  So follow me on this one. You're watching your favorite show, maybe it’s ""Mr. Robot.” You're watching it while you’ve got your HoloLens glasses on, and they’ll be very lightweight. And as you're watching it, you'll be able to pause, stop, zoom in, see that shirt that Rami Malek is wearing and say, ""I wanna buy that shirt."" You're gonna buy that shirt.  And as you're watching, you’re going to be able to pause, stop, and see the casting. And then you go to IMDB and you're gonna see digital assets. And then while that's happening, you can just swap your frame and you can go to your football game.  While you're watching your football game, you think, “Wait a second, did he step out of bounds?” You can pause, you can zoom in, you can see that he actually did step out of bounds.  Then you can check the game’s over-under [gambling odds], and for fantasy football you’ve got your stats, you got all your players and you can buy and sell memorabilia. And all of this is gonna be happening behind the veil of your extended reality glasses that will be connected to the blockchain to authenticate all this stuff.  Last question. What’s your ultimate goal with all of this?  I want to leave a legacy of work – that can be writings, poems, films, performances, screenplays, you name it. When the blockchain archaeologists of the next millennia look back in time at these early days of NFTs, they’ll look at what art was really standing out, what art really talked about our civilization. And I hope that my art will be in that discussion.  That’s a good goal. Congrats, and best of luck with “Razor.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | AR | GALA,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/12/i-knew-i-was-here-to-stay-talking-the-future-of-web-3-with-david-bianchi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb89a80a5bc1381e05e553b065f37855656d5a69-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411334,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNE67,1665590728,What Credit Suisse and Three Arrows Capital Have in Common,"Credit Suisse could be $8 billion short of its required capital ratio by 2024, according to a recent analysis by JPMorgan. The math here is beyond the ken of mere mortals, but as summarized by Seeking Alpha, the projected shortfall is thanks to a mix of weak projected earnings, rising inflation, a risk-heavy balance sheet , lawyer fees as well as costs if Suisse is forced to restructure.  A Jefferies analyst speaking to Bloomberg agreed, saying Suisse needed to raise around 9 billion Swiss francs (about US$9 billion) in the next two to three years. So Suisse must either sell assets or issue new stock, at a moment in the business cycle when you definitely, really don’t want to be doing either of those things. Especially if you’re Credit Suisse.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The litany of failures that led Suisse to this pass is … well, it’s a litany. A litany that is, nearly from start to finish, utterly hilarious. But if ranked for both sheer destruction and unalloyed comedy gold, top of the list has to be Suisse’s role in the meltdown of the hedge fund Archegos.  Archegos was a “hedge” fund in name only, in that it seemingly neglected to hedge, or for that matter to perform basic risk management. The fund’s strategy was essentially a pump-and-dump on a basket of blue chip stocks, which Archegos itself drove up by buying at huge scale using immense amounts of leverage, aka debt.  If that sounds familiar, you may be thinking of a humble little trading shop called Three Arrows Capital (or 3AC), which ran basically the same strategy with bitcoin and other crypto assets.  Leveraging up a small set of assets to pump your balance sheet is a strategy that works right up until the point you actually have to sell the assets you’ve inflated, and realize nobody is willing to pay the prices you did. Whoopsie!  Archegos ultimately nuked roughly $20 billion into the dirt, with Suisse alone on the hook for a stunning $5.5 billion of that. That’s believed to be the highest loss among the several banks whose big loans let Archegos run its boneheaded strategy . Other lenders, including Goldman Sachs, simply managed to get out faster.  Three Arrows Capital, for its part, used leverage to turn about $10 billion into dust. Archegos is beating Three Arrows on another metric – Archegos management already faces charges of fraud, with the U.S. Department of Justice alleging the firm engaged in market manipulation. Similar charges could be coming for Three Arrows. But because tradfi still has its boring aspects, Archegos founder Bill Hwang has not escaped to international waters.  3AC was considered the most important fund in crypto, while Archegos was just one of many in TradFi. However, there are a few parallels between the firms worth noting. First, the numbers are shockingly similar, if not exactly comparable. The second parallel is more important: In the 2010s, fancy investment bankers made the same utterly brain-dead sort of bets as the wild-eyed psychos who (presumably) run money in crypto.  See also: How to Avoid Crypto Bear Market Mistakes  Most humiliating of all, a post-mortem found that at every step of the way Suisse’s missteps were the result of mere incompetence rather than “fraudulent or illegal conduct.” By the standards of polite society, of course, that could be considered a plus. But remember that we’re talking about bankers here – regardless of what’s said in the light of day, it’s obviously preferable to be a crook than a sucker.  Other global investment banks are bad in different ways – Deutsche Bank and HSBC are money laundering factories, Goldman Sachs is a heartless vampire squid, etc. But if you’re a global bank, you want to be bad the way Goldman and Deutsche are bad (evil and mercenary), NOT in the way Credit Suisse is bad (incompetent and disarrayed).  Suisse’s history of bumbling is too varied and manifold to detail here, but at the same time it was losing money on Archegos it was also entangled in another alleged fraud called Greensill Capital, a U.K.-based finance firm generating an estimated $1.72 billion loss. Credit Suisse is also currently under investigation for tax fraud. Then there’s the Suisse private banker who allegedly defrauded the former prime minister of Georgia to the tune of $800 million.  Suisse has also been accused of spying on its own employees, which led to the resignation of a CEO in 2020. The chief executive brought in to clean house resigned after two years as further scandals and screwups rolled in.  All that makes it hard to imagine who would want to own more of Suisse, or pay actual money to shoulder responsibility for units whose balance sheets could be as full of holes as Swiss cheese. In an absolute worst-case scenario, all this could mean Suisse becomes insolvent sometime in the next few years.  See also: It Doesn't Matter If They're Wrong, Central Bankers Set Bad Policy for Crypto too  The good news is that, at least for now, analysts don’t see Suisse as a systemic risk in the way that Lehman Brothers was in 2008. Still, there are ways to view Suisse’s ineptitude as systemic to modern banking. Some point to the moral hazard of bailouts to explain banks’ risk exposure. Or perhaps big banks consistently make huge mistakes because the concentration of power reduces diversity of thought. That could mean a less concentrated financial system would provide better outcomes.

That&apos;s partly because the &apos;reliance of the running of a large portion of the blockchain on a single or small group of cloud service providers becomes a non-negligible risk to consider,&apos; Shah wrote in a note to clients. For instance, 65% of ethereum&apos;s (ETH-USD) nodes are hosted by a cloud provider, with Amazon Web Services accounting for half of them, the note said. And problems could emerge if service providers decide to censor certain participants or crypto products, or if there are lengthy server outages. &apos;The crypto ecosystem has evolved over recent years with many applications, code, services and companies feeding into the underlying decentralized blockchains, which we would argue is causing parts of the broader crypto ecosystem to become less decentralised and more dependent on individual services,&apos; Shah explained. As part of ether&apos;s (ETH-USD) centralization issue, 60% of the blockchain&apos;s validators are managed by just four companies, Shah pointed out. Note that since ether&apos;s transition to Proof-of-Stake from Proof-of-Work in mid-September, transactions have been approved by validators, canceling out the need for miners as part of the software update.

42420940,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtw0j,1665587150,Bitcoin and Beyond: The Future of Cryptocurrency Investing,"Since 2009, when Bitcoin was quietly launched by its creator, the technology spurred thousands of digital money projects, creating a vibrant and lucrative landscape for investors.  Investors now come in all sorts of flavors. What once was a small group of geeky believers is now a diverse crowd of people, from cypherpunks to big mainstream companies and large investment funds.  Currency is a presentation category at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy.  Learn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse. Register here.  With cryptocurrencies gaining traction as an investment asset, investors are showing interest in a wider variety of crypto assets – not just bitcoin, experts told CoinDesk.  Shift from the 'digital gold'  The landscape for institutional crypto investors has been definitely shifting recently, says Ajit Tripathi, former investment banker at Barclays and Goldman Sachs and until recently head of institutional business at decentralized finance (DeFi) project Aave.  “I’ve been talking to some sovereign fund [managers] last week, and they [have] started making token investments,” Tripathi told CoinDesk in an interview. He said at least some of the funds managing the sovereign wealth of entire countries, have started taking baby steps into crypto beyond bitcoin.  Investments of this kind usually do not exceed 1% of such funds' total allocation, and the biggest part of it would be into bitcoin and crypto-exposed venture funds such as Pantera and a16z, among others. However, some of that allocation could also be invested in other, smaller cryptocurrencies.  “You can’t invest a hundred million dollars in a s**tcoin. So you would put a half in bitcoin and ether, and the other half in venture funds, like Pantera and a16z, and a small part, as a learning exercise, in other tokens,” Tripathi said.  Before, bitcoin looked like the safest bet in the eyes of institutions due to the “inflation hedge” and “digital gold” narratives. Also, bitcoin was one of just two crypto assets cleared from regulatory risks by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision. However, now the bitcoin narrative is changing and attention is slowly moving to newer projects, including ether, MATIC, ATOM and SOL as well as gaming and DeFi tokens, Tripathi said.  For instance, GoldenTree, a $50 billion private asset manager bought $5.2 worth of SUSHI tokens, the digital asset of the SushiSwap decentralized exchange (DEX).  Read more: Investing in Web3: Culture and Entertainment  “Until 2019 crypto was not really seen by institutions as an asset class,” Tripathi said. However, since then a couple things helped bring some serious attention to crypto: the U.S. government unleashing the “money printer” during the COVID-19 pandemic and PayPal introducing its cryptocurrency trading and custody service, Tripathi said.  “The legitimization and mainstreaming of crypto as an asset class has been pretty much accelerated,” he added.  Tyler Spalding, co-founder of payment startup Flexa, agrees. He said institutional funds are increasingly looking into tokens issued by decentralized trading protocols including Uniswap, Compound and SushiSwap.  Stablecoins vs. CBDCs?  One of the crucial parts of the crypto market infrastructure is stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies that maintain a stable price by pegging the coin to an asset such as a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar. The two biggest dollar-backed stablecoins are tether (USDT) and USDC.  Stablecoins might soon be challenged by central bank digital currencies (CBDC), according to Eswar Prasad, professor at Cornell University, a former International Monetary Fund (IMF) official and author of “The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution Is Transforming Currencies and Finance.”  “The emergence of CBDCs and the displacement of cash by CBDCs will almost certainly become the reality. We already see China, Japan and Sweden central banks initiating experiments with CBDcs, and I suspect all of these economies will issue CBDCs in the next three to five years,” Prasad told CoinDesk.  Unlike the stablecoins running on decentralized permissionless ledgers such as Ethereum or Tron, central banks favor ecosystems they can control. So there is little chance the governments of the world will allow stablecoins to be on a par with CBDCs once the latter are in place, said John Kiff, former senior financial sector expert at the IMF.  There will always be a place for private stablecoins for gray market use cases and capital control avoidance, he added. But there is a bigger market that will probably be only open to stablecoins, Kiff said: tokenized securities.  Some countries are already experimenting with issuing securities on blockchain and settling them with digital currencies, such as the Helvetia project recently piloted by the Bank of International Settlements, Swiss National Bank and SIX Exchange, Kiff said.  He sees projects like this expanding in the years to come, especially in developing economies. However, in the advanced economies with sophisticated securities market, putting all the infrastructure on the new rails will take a while, he added. In the U.S. we won’t see as much as a limited pilot of this kind in the next three to five years, Kiff said.  Christopher Giancarlo, former Commodity and Futures Trading Commission chairman and “Crypto Dad” because of his friendly attitude towards crypto, believes there is room for “healthy competition” between CBDCs and privately issued stablecoins, “at least in the free world,” he said.  Ajit Tripathi thinks otherwise: CBDCs won’t find any actual use case in developed economies, but privately issued stablecoins will become an integral part of the banking system. They will be much more regulated than they are now and will probably become something more similar to banks in a regulatory sense. “And then, as long as you follow the rules, you’re a part of the payment rails,” Tripathi said.  Stablecoins acquiring banking charters or gaining similar regulatory status is one or two years away, Tripathi believes.  The rail builders  What does this mean for investors? As the technical and legal infrastructure will be created for the next generation of digital payments – those who are building that infrastructure will benefit from the transformation and those who invest in the builders.  For example, projects that are creating enterprise systems on Ethereum or R3’s Corda, which has been quite popular for CBDCs pilots around the world, might be where investors should be looking, said Kiff. Projects like Stellar, Algorand and Avalanche may also be likely candidates to provide countries with tech for CBDCs, he added.  Flexa’s Spalding believes decentralized protocols with their own governance tokens, such as Compound or Uniswap, will become “ultra-successful” in the years to come if they use a model where the platforms’ revenues are distributed among token holders, just as traditional companies do with their shareholders.  Read more: ‘No Central Points of Failure’: Sunny Aggarwal on ATOM 2.0, Mesh Networks and Cosmos’ Future  Alex McDougall, CEO of a technology startup Stablecorp, believes viable, “hardened, tested and disputed” decentralized governance models will be worked out by the industry in the next seven to 10 years. However, it’s going to take up to 20 years for those models withstand expected battles in courts and with regulators.  In the meantime, companies building bridges among blockchains, fiat currencies and trading platforms, not necessarily in a decentralized way, will be reaping the benefits, unlocking the “trillion dollars of friction tax that’s locked up in the financial services system right now,” McDougall said, referring to the fees and service hiccups that happen while switching from one currency or blockchain to another.  'Bitcoin standard' holding on  All these trends do not mean the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market cap has lost its attractiveness for investors, experts say. If anything, it is considered the benchmark of the crypto market, not as profitable as some other coins but not as precarious either.  “Bitcoin is kind of a reserve currency for the crypto market,” said Kiff. “I think of it almost like an index fund of the crypto market. It’s a good place to park my money when I’m not investing in anything specific.”  Bitcoin will most likely keep this status, especially “if it sticks to its roots, to the proof-of-work [system], although we complain about it so much,” Kiff said. He added that of all cryptocurrencies, bitcoin remains the most decentralized.  “It has been going so far without any glitches or anything. Bitcoin has worked like clockwork since 2009. It’s pretty impressive,” Kiff said.  Giancarlo, the former CFTC chairman, said the past few weeks have revealed an interesting trend: While the U.S. dollar has been gaining strength over the past year, other global reserve currencies have been losing steam. But not bitcoin. While British traders have been selling pounds to buy dollars, bitcoin is continuing to trade in a narrow range of around $20,000.  Traders “are not selling bitcoin to buy dollars the way they’re selling yen to buy dollars or they’re selling pounds to buy dollars. At a time of a global economic stress, when many traditional currencies are being diminished in value, bitcoin is not,” Giancarlo said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/12/bitcoin-and-beyond-the-future-of-cryptocurrency-investing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/995899fc794d41c7cf1ffa22439a5d0474f64922-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435002,tMM71Y4MCzC4OCrGaGniR1,1665585724,Crypto Data Science Shop Gauntlet Launches Treasury Management System for DAOs,"Aera, a rewards-based treasury management system for leaderless decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) has been launched by the team behind cryptocurrency data science shop Gauntlet.  The Aera protocol aims to make DAOs play a more agile and risk-aware role when it comes to investing in the fast-moving world of decentralized finance (DeFi). The hope is to create organic demand for the sort of structured products or derivatives used for hedging risk and improving capital efficiency in traditional finance.  Aera will incentivize certain DAO participants to allocate assets to risk products for which they will be rewarded with fees when investment goals are met, or penalized if they worsen the DAO’s welfare.  Areas like DeFi cannot rely on steady, non-speculative institutional flows into structured products, as is the case in traditional markets where big asset managers hedge industry-wide portfolios with credit default swaps, for example, or airlines hedge oil and energy costs in the futures markets.  A range of DeFi-tailored credit default swaps, options protocols and portfolio insurance products do exist but their uptake has been spotty. One reason is because there hasn’t been a nimble way for DAOs to perform the role of risk-aware DeFi institutions and proactively create derivative flows, according to Gauntlet CEO Tarun Chitra.  Unlike the high-speed trading behavior carried out by holders of risk products, usually geared around rare market events, DAOs grind out slow and reactionary governance voting on everything from code changes to treasury allocation decisions, Chitra said. (Asking a DAO to manage a portfolio of derivatives would be akin to asking the U.S. Congress to be a derivatives market maker, passing laws to execute particular trades.)  “The only institutions that are fully on-chain that could generate organic demand for these derivatives products are DAOs, which have a need to deploy tokens strategically to maximize their longevity,” Chitra said in an interview. “DAOs have this capital, so it’s about starting a flywheel where they send allocations to other on-chain protocols, which causes the liquidity to rise in those protocols and lowers the price for execution, and then it makes it easier for new DAOs to purchase. That feedback loop has been missing.”  The $10 billion or so of assets held collectively by DAOs are also not used properly because of incentive mismatches between participants who may be averse to large block sales of the governance tokens they hold as it makes the price of those tokens go down.  “A good example is SushiSwap, where people are using a token to vote to sell that token, which generally has not worked,” Chitra said. “There have been a few diversifications where DAOs were able to kind of rebalance their assets, but I think you need a new perspective on how to incentivize people who are trying to help manage DAO assets.”  Aera takes some of its inspiration from the early days of DAO experimentation and such lofty concepts as “futarchy,” the idea that a public company could hold its chief executive accountable to achieving a particular stock price over a given period of time.  “Futarchy is this older idea from Vitalik [Buterin] and Robin Hanson, which is like a prediction market that optimizes a key DAO metric,” Chitra said. “But Aera is designed to be DeFi incentive-compatible, as opposed to those initial versions of futarchy where a new asset had to be created every time there was a vote.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/12/crypto-data-science-shop-gauntlet-launches-treasury-management-system-for-daos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b7065f5cd22aa54b016036fb7eadf989a1430aa-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Depositors on Curve earn up to 4% annual yields from one of the many pools on the platform. Curve is the third-largest decentralized finance (DeFi) project with over $5.8 billion in value locked. Its CRV are issued as yield farming rewards to liquidity providers on Curve Finance, and can be converted into vote-escrowed CRV (veCRV). Holding veCRV allows users to participate in platform governance, earn higher rewards and fees and receive airdrops.  An on-chain governance proposal floated last week sought to end other projects by undertaking several steps before offering and managing CRV rewards to their users. Projects would previously have had to either float their own governance proposals or use the assistance of a core Curve team member to offer CRV rewards to users.  Over 96% of all votes agreed with the proposal with some 327 million CRV staked. Just 3.6% voted no. The deployment would massively reduce the time required to deploy and manage CRV rewards to third-party applications.  “The contract will enable gauge creators to bypass both and manage gauge rewards themselves,” the Curve proposal read. Gauges on Curve measure how much a user provides in liquidity based on which they receive CRV or other tokens in rewards.  The allocation of CRV among the various gauges is dictated by veCRV holders through a weekly vote. These holders would still determine how much rewards are distributed to Curve guage holders via a governance vote.  Curve core team member skellet0r said the ability to add a rewards gauge without permission was a highly demanded feature from Curve’s users.  “Requests for assistance to add rewards to factory gauges has been very consistent,” skellet0r wrote on governance forums.  “The extension was written because the Liquidity team wanted a seamless/painless/trustless way to deploy their gauge and then instantly add rewards during their deployment,” they further explained, pointing out the problem this deployment solved was that of the lengthy time required between proposing and enabling gauge rewards.",POSITIVE,CRV,CRV | MINING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/12/curve-dao-proposal-to-enable-easier-crv-rewards-passes-with-overwhelming-support,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e21a591142511d9d4e4446ce48c2ecb1c0e4254-3333x2500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394648,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUkJS,1665583080,Bitcoin Miner Crusoe Energy Buys Fellow Flared-Gas Operator GAM,"Bitcoin miner Crusoe Energy has acquired peer Great American Mining (GAM), adding 9% to its capacity as the industry continues to consolidate amid a challenging market that is squeezing miners' margins.  In the past few months, miners have seen their profits dwindle amid the bear market and rising energy prices globally. Some have already turned to mergers and acquisitions for survival, with others taking advantage of the opportunities.  Under the agreement, Crusoe will take over all of GAM's operating assets across five states, the firm said in a press release on Wednesday. Those assets comprise more than 10 megawatts (MW) of operational bitcoin mining capacity, about 4,000 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners, a manufacturing facility in Louisiana, 24 employees and commercial relationships with several large-scale energy producers in North Dakota and Montana. GAM's facilities will be using Crusoe's patented technology for flared-gas mitigation.  GAM produces containers for bitcoin mining in Ponchatoula, Louisiana, and deploys them across North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania, according to its website.  The acquisition will add around 9% to Crusoe’s capacity, such that the firm will count 125 deployed flare gas-powered modular data centers. This will, in turn, increase its capacity to reduce CO2-equivalent emissions toapproximately 800,000 metric tons per year, which is the equivalent of removing approximately 170,000 cars from circulation, the company said.  Crusoe and GAM both use flared gas to mine bitcoin, meaning they power their machines using excess gas that is released when drilling for fossil fuels, thus reducing their emissions. This is touted as environmentally friendly and the Biden White House recognized its potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in a recent report.  Crusoe is working with oil producers in the Middle East for flared-gas mining and was reported to have partnered with ExxonMobil. Meanwhile, another oil and gas giant ConocoPhillips, is also looking into the industry.

The fundraise included participation from venture capital firms Coinbase Ventures, DeFiance Capital, Saison Capital and others. A spokesperson for Gomu declined to disclose the company’s valuation.  Founded earlier this summer, Gomu has launched two products, NFT Hub and Collection.xyz, which make it easier to grow NFT communities.  NFT Hub provides a customizable community hub and marketplace to NFT projects, allowing startup collections to more easily build an online space for their holders. “NFT communities can create custom marketplaces and token-gated communities in minutes, all without having any prior experience with blockchain technology,” said Gomu in a statement.  Gomu’s other product, Collection.xyz, is a liquidity incentive protocol that makes NFTs more tradeable.  “Collection.xyz makes it easy for users to receive token rewards for putting up their NFTs and crypto in a liquidity pool, committing to buy and sell at a certain price range,” Gomu CEO and co-founder Spencer Yang told CoinDesk. “Anyone can reward users with ERC-20 tokens for providing the liquidity since it helps to promote a healthier market.”  Read More: DeFiance Capital's Arthur Cheong Is Raising Money for a New Fund: Sources  Yang and co-founder Jeremy Seow both previously worked at token data website CoinMarketCap, and also had stints at crypto firms Coinbase and Chainlink, respectively.

The draft of at least some of this legislation was introduced only in late September, local reports show, indicating how quickly the new rules are moving forward. The bills address the issuance and circulation of ""secured and unsecured digital assets,"" according to Ekaterina Smyshlyaeva, a member of the lower house's Committee on Economic Reform and Regional Development.  Smyshlyaeva also said the bills were developed ""in pursuance"" of instructions from President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on curbing problems related to crypto mining.  After China banned energy-intensive crypto mining in that country, miners fled to other jurisdictions with cheap electricity, with energy-rich Kazakhstan becoming a main attraction. The country soon began to struggle with energy shortages, and authorities began cracking down on the mining industry. Since May, the government has required crypto miners to register their operations with local authorities. In July, Tokayev signed into law increased levies on crypto miners.

Over 730,000 retail customers can now invest in four curated portfolios of crypto assets covering everything from broad market themes to decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, with metaverse plays and sustainability in between. They’re constructed for ease of access, Jesse Proudman, vice-president of crypto investing at Betterment, told CoinDesk.  “The objective with this crypto product is to really simplify the entire investing experience here, particularly into a diversified portfolio versus requiring clients to sort of pick individual coins or assets to go buy on their own,” Proudman said.  Last month, Betterment partnered with crypto exchange Gemini to launch crypto investing portfolio service for its customers. The latest Betterment crypto product is constructed from digital assets listed on Gemini, with Gemini as the custodian.  The company also guides its customers to limit their crypto exposure to not more than 5% of their investable assets.  “Investing team did a bunch of analysis on sort of portfolio design, and ultimately sort of settled on that 5% target as sort of an optimal risk-reward allocation,” Proudman added.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET,Xinyi Luo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/12/robo-adviser-betterment-launches-cryptocurrency-offering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b7fc33690e6225df94954e5501d6a99552515c2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, remains at the $19,000 level after hitting a low of $18,860 on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency has been holding fairly resilient recently, compared to the rest of financial markets: The S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined Tuesday in a volatile session, with the Nasdaq falling into its second bear market of the year.  On Wednesday, U.S.stocks appeared on track for a modest recovery.  According to Bitfinex analysts, bitcoin might be gearing up for a significant price move, with coins apparently being pulled down from centralized exchanges; that’s typically seen as moving the cryptocurrency to storage, which means the owners have little intention of selling out of positions anytime soon.  The largest bitcoin outflows in the last three months occurred over three days during the last week (Oct. 1-4), according to data from Bitfinex.  “This buying pressure most likely indicates that many traders and investors bought the recent rally and are anticipating soon-to-be new highs,” said Bitfinex.  But crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital Laurent Kssis, predicts the move will be downward.  “The crypto market is currently unfavorable as a protection of any sort and it seems people are purely speculating that a rally will occur,” said Kssis in an interview with CoinDesk. “Without any convincing evidence that the crypto market has any impetus I remain bearish for the near term.”  Ether (ETH) gained 2% on the day, holding the $1,300 level.

42394655,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUkON,1665577458,'High Risk' Crypto Activity Surges in Eastern Europe Amid Russia-Ukraine War: Chainalysis,"Crypto activity determined as ""high risk"" or ""illicit"" has surged in Eastern Europe since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, according to a report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.  The report reveals that 18.2% of all crypto transactions in Eastern Europe are associated with risky or illicit activity.  A portion of risky activity in Eastern Europe comes from interaction with high-risk crypto exchanges, which typically don't require customers to submit know-your-customer (KYC) information.  Russian citizens have been forced to use lesser-known exchanges after a series of European Union (EU) sanctions restricted Russians from accessing European crypto services. Neighboring Eastern European nation Estonia, which last year was considered a crypto and tech hub, is expected to see an exodus of 90% of crypto business as it plans to enforce stricter rules around the digital asset industry later this year.  Whilst the initial Chainalysis figures paints a pejorative picture of Eastern Europe's crypto activity, it's vital to note that illicit activity is on a par with North America and Latin America - and that it is dwarfed by illicit activity in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The figure that skews the data is connected to high-risk activity, which could be anything from online gambling to a high-risk exchange or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. As Russians have been prohibited from accessing European crypto businesses due to sanctions, the rise in high risk activity connected to exchanges is expected.  DeFi is an umbrella term for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain without traditional middlemen.

The firm said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on Wednesday that it ""intends to vigorously defend its interests"" and that it has retained legal advisors to assist it with relation to Celsius Mining.  ""An adverse or untimely ruling by the bankruptcy court that provides Celsius the benefits of the Company’s hosting services without Celsius fully paying the costs of such services would have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows,"" the firm said.

Along with Celsius Network, its parent company, Celsius Mining filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in July.  Last month, Celsius alleged that Core was in violation of the automatic stay which Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection provides, which prevents any enforcement action or the start or continuation of other legal proceedings by creditors.  Core Scientific disagrees with the allegations made and will continue to seek ""resolution from the bankruptcy court and payment of any outstanding amounts owed.""

42394649,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUkIT,1665573382,Morgan Stanley Says Crypto Ecosystem Is Becoming Less Decentralized,"The crypto ecosystem is becoming less decentralized, Morgan Stanley (MS) said in a research report on Wednesday.  The underlying blockchains themselves may be decentralized, but as crypto regulation develops the need to run a large part of the blockchain on a single or small group of cloud providers becomes a potential risk, the report said.  The report said 65% of Ethereum’s nodes are cloud hosted, and half of these use Amazon Web Services (AWS). If certain service providers decide to censor some participants or crypto products or if there are lengthy server outages, this could become a problem.  The crypto ecosystem has evolved “with many applications, code, services and companies feeding into the underlying decentralized blockchains,” which Morgan Stanley says is causing some parts of the ecosystem to become less decentralized and more dependent on individual services.  The bank says this isn’t surprising as “centralization is a natural evolution of the financialization of cryptocurrency markets,” although it does bring new challenges.  Since the Ethereum blockchain shifted to proof-of-stake (PoS) last month, a transition known as the Merge, transactions are now approved by validators and 60% of these validators are managed by only four companies, the report said. The Ethereum community is aware of this centralization issue and is working on potential solutions.  The largest decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) are also developing to become more like centralized companies, the bank said. The report noted decentralized exchange Uniswap recently voted to establish a foundation consisting of a management team, advisers and a board managing their own financial budget.  A DAO is a blockchain-based form of organization or company that is often governed by a native crypto token. Holders of these tokens can vote on important matters directly related to the DAO, and they typically use smart contracts in place of traditional corporate structures.  As the digital assets market has developed cryptocurrency products that comply with regulations and attract users, it is beginning to look more like the centralized banking world, the note said. At the same time, traditional finance (TradFi) is rapidly launching crypto products to offer transaction-based services and other related offerings for their clients.

As more updates aimed at these problems lie around the corner, several projects and companies are duking it out with their own solutions for solving Ethereum's user experience shortcomings. The winner (or winners) of this competition will play a major role in defining Ethereum – and assuring its survival – in the years to come. But the shift to this new future has been slow going.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Ethereum’s UX woes  Anyone who has used Ethereum will be familiar with the bummer that is gas fees – a sort of tax that users pay on transactions to help keep the network up and running.  At the peak of crypto’s last hype cycle, network congestion sent Ethereum transaction fees through the roof. Simply sending tokens from one blockchain address to another could’ve cost as much as $5, and more complicated actions – like exchanging currencies via a decentralized exchange like Uniswap – were often so expensive as to become cost-prohibitive (think flat rates of $40 per swap).  Ethereum’s ability to expand will not depend on upgrades to its core technology, but on “rollups” – third-party networks that provide a quicker, cheaper platform for transactions.  Rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism solve for Ethereum’s high fees by processing transactions quickly and cheaply on a separate “layer 2” network that runs alongside Ethereum. These layer 2 transactions get bundled up and passed back down to Ethereum's main network with some kind of mechanism to “prove” they haven’t been tampered with. If everything checks out, the transactions are recorded in Ethereum’s ledger like any other.  Read more: What Are Layer 2s and Why Are They Important?  Rollup networks are generally considered the answer to Ethereum’s scaling woes – enabling the Ethereum ecosystem to welcome new users without making any updates to its core code.  Arbitrum and Optimism, the first rollups to launch, were welcomed with open arms by an Ethereum community desperate for a more usable blockchain network, and it was hoped that Ethereum app builders would move en masse to their cheaper shores rather than leave the ecosystem altogether in favor of newer blockchains (e.g., Solana) or less-secure sidechains (e.g., Polygon).  But it hasn’t been smooth scaling for Ethreum’s keystone rollups. Arbitrum and Optimism have thus far failed to gain the sort of traction their creators envisioned at the height of 2021’s crypto mania, and the emergence of more technically advanced competitors threaten to render them obsolete before they even leave a mark.  The Optimistic rollup race  Today, Arbitrum and Optimism house a combined $3 billion in assets – paltry in comparison to Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) of $60 billion.  The teams behind Arbitrum and Optimism have vied to increase their market shares through a series of product launches, incentive programs and community outreach campaigns.  Arbitrum, for its part, recently launched Arbitrum Nitro – a splashy update to its platform with across-the-board user experience upgrades. The team also built out a cheaper and faster (albeit slightly less secure) version of the network aimed at more demanding applications, such as gaming.  For a while, Arbitrum’s usage was an order of magnitude higher than Optimism’s, but Optimism eventually managed to make headway with the launch of its native OP token. The rollout of Optimism’s token and accompanying community governance system was initially bungled, but the token has, in recent months, succeeded in attracting users to the platform.  One piece of evidence that OP has aided network adoption is the growth of Optimism’s version of Aave, a stalwart of crypto lending and borrowing that initially launched on Ethereum. Aave expanded to Arbitrum and Optimism this year, but Optimism, unlike Arbitrum (which has no token) offered OP tokens as an incentive for people to use Aave on its network.  The OP incentive program caused Aave’s lending volume on Optimism to blow past that on Arbitrum, whose creators have shied away from providing the same kind of direct economic incentives for users to jump aboard.  Optimism’s TVL of $1.9 billion, a key – albeit imperfect – measure of network adoption, recently surpassed Arbitrum’s $1.5 billion TVL, with its success owing largely to the Aave/OP token incentive program (Aave alone accounts for more than 60% of Optimism’s TVL).  But Optimism cannot yet declare victory in Ethereum’s rollup race. Earlier this week, Aribitrum boasted double the number of active addresses compared to Optimism, according to blockchain analytics firm Nansen. It’s not a sure bet, moreover, that Optimism’s OP handouts will be a sustainable way for it to extend its TVL lead: Crypto’s addiction to subsidizing users in search of high yields has, in the past, come under fire for attracting disloyal, mercenary capital as opposed to building organic communities.  The rise of ZK rollups  The success of Arbitrum and Optimism may ultimately lie less in how they compete with each other and more in how they adapt to the emergence of new rollup technologies.  Arbitrum and Optimism are both “Optimistic” rollups. In these systems, after rollup transactions are bundled up and passed down to Ethereum, network operators have a period of time in which they can pore over transaction data and reject any activity that looks fishy. This mechanism – which “optimistically” assumes transactions are correct unless they are disputed – carries the potential for delays and security vulnerabilities.  But there’s a new kid on the rollup block. So-called zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups work similarly to Optimistic rollups by processing transactions on a layer 2 network, but they use fancy cryptography – so-called zero-knowledge proofs – to definitively prove that the transactions they pass down to Ethereum are trustworthy.  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  As Arbitrum and Optimism are finally beginning to show some signs of growth, several competitors are already gearing up to launch “zkEVMs” – ZK-rollup networks that, like Arbitrum and Optimism, can support virtually any Ethereum-based application.  Ethereum scaling behemoth Polygon recently launched a test version of its zkEVM, and two other companies – Matter Labs (the creators of zkSync) and Scroll – are operating on a similar timeline.  In comparison with the optimistic, give-’em-the-benefit-of-the-doubt tech used by Aribtrum and Optimism, ZK tech is generally considered more advanced and secure.  But fully fleshed-out ZK rollups were thought to be years away when Optimistic rollups debuted last year, and there’s a chance that the hubbub around soon-to-arrive ZK rollups is partially marketing hype.  “I'm skeptical that the ZK technology is ready to operate at the scale that is needed to run a competitive layer 2,” Ed Felten, the Princeton Computer Science professor who co-founded Arbitrum builders Offchain Labs, told CoinDesk. “For general [Ethereum applications], I'm very skeptical that they will be ready to do that soon. … Maybe one of these systems will come out and be fully functional and have fully working ZK proofs soon, but I would bet against that occurring.”  The Arbitrum and Optimism teams recognize, however, the theoretical advantages of ZK technology and have expressed openness to integrating it into their platforms once it matures.  “We've said from the beginning, it has always been our strategy that we are not tied to Optimistic as opposed to ZK [rollups] in terms of what we provide, and if the moment comes when we think ZK is viable for what our user base needs we would switch,” said Felten.  Whatever the long-term ZK plans of Optimism and Arbitrum, it’s difficult to imagine that Ethereum’s rollup first-movers are undaunted by the trio of competitors nipping at their heels.  Proto-danksharding and danksharding  Whether or not Arbitrum, Optimism, or some new ZK contender ultimately takes Ethereum’s rollup throne, the Ethereum community is going all-in on a vision where rollups become the network’s main point of entry.  Read more: Scaling Ethereum Beyond the Merge: Danksharding  Key to Ethereum’s rollup-centric vision will be danksharding and proto-danksharding – a set of network upgrades that will make it easier for rollups to pass data back down to Ethereum’s base chain.  Sharding is a method of increasing network transaction capacity – thereby boosting speeds and decreasing costs – by splitting up activity across multiple “shards,” almost like adding new lanes to a congested highway. Sharding was initially slated to accompany Ethereum’s shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, but it was deprioritized due to its technical complexity and the fact that rollups were already solving some of Ethereum's most pressing scaling problems.  Now that Ethereum’s Merge and transition to proof-of-stake is out of the way and the rollup landscape is beginning to mature, developers have put sharding back on its roadmap – but with a rollup-focused twist.  Rather than making it easier for Etheruem to handle more transactions, proto-danksharding and danksharding will make it easier for the network to process abstract “blobs” of data. Ethereum’s network was initially optimized to handle transactions one by one, but rollups pass down lumps of data representing large groups of transactions. The more data the network can handle, the more layer 2 transactions it will be able to process.  “Both [danksharding and proto-danksharding] will significantly reduce the cost of data on Ethereum, which is the biggest source of cost in operating layer 2 systems like ours,” Felten said. “So those mean a substantial reduction in cost and therefore substantial reduction in fees that our users pay.”  Though Optimism and Arbitrum have thus far struggled to attract the lion’s share of Ethereum users, these upgrades all but guarantee that they (and their soon-to-arrive competitors) will have a key role to play whenever the next crypto craze arrives.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ARB | OP | ZK,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/12/ethereums-second-layer-projects-duke-it-out-for-dominance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec48f5d7f135548876fbfef4ab707ba324c9bad3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A volunteer claimed on the Temple DAO Discord channel that the project&apos;s CORE vaults, which contain more than $100 million in stablecoins, are untouched, preventing further damage. The contributor stated that all impacted users would receive remediation. According to Etherscan data, on October 11, a withdrawal from the project&apos;s STAX staking vault occurred. A statement issued on the Temple DAO Discord stated that the withdrawal was exactly 1,418,303 TEMPLE and 1,362,438 FRAX.

42394658,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUkSJ,1665571831,Bitcoin Technical Indicator Signals Big Moves With Some Traders Getting Ready to 'Sell Volatility',"Bitcoin (BTC) traders will soon get the one thing they love the most: market volatility. That's the signal from a technical indicator called Bollinger bandwidth, which is used to gauge periods of high and low volatility and shifts in volatility trends.  The indicator is calculated by dividing the spread between the Bollinger Bands by the 20-day average of the cryptocurrency's price. Bollinger Bands are volatility lines placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day average of price.  The bandwidth falls, indicating low volatility when standard deviation bands contract. On the flip side, the bandwidth rises, implying a pick up in volatility when the bands expand.  Volatility is said to be mean-reverting, which means periods of high volatility are often followed by dour price action, while a low volatility environment usually ends with increased price turbulence.  Since the end of June, the bitcoin market has seen a volatility meltdown, with the bandwidth indicator falling from 0.76 to 0.08, the lowest since October 2020.  Therefore, a big move in either direction appears overdue – more so, as historically, below-0.10 readings on the bandwidth have marked an explosion in price volatility.  Bitcoin has been trading in the narrow range of 18,500 to $20,500 for nearly a month, CoinDesk data shows.  Good time to buy volatility (or options)?  According to some traders, it's probably too late to bet on a higher volatility, because options, or derivative contracts offering protection against rapid price moves in either direction, have become expensive.  When anticipating a big move in either direction, sophisticated traders build a ""net long volatility"" portfolio so that their investment's value increases when the price movements become rapid. One common strategy employed by seasoned traders is to buy options – either a call or put or both. That's because a pickup in price turbulence has investors scrambling for hedges. That boosts demand for options, making them pricier.  However, most traders do so when options look cheap – a situation where expected or implied volatility already priced in the options market is lower than historical or realized volatility. Meanwhile, traders sell options when look expensive – a situation where implied volatility is greater than historical volatility.  At press time, short duration options appear costlier, with the seven-day implied volatility greater than realized volatility. More importantly, the gap between the two, known as the variance risk premium, has recently widened.  ""This would be a better time to sell volatility [sell options] than bet on a volatility explosion higher,"" Gregoire Magadini, CEO of options analytics platform Genesis Volatility, told CoinDesk. ""The variance risk premium has grown bigger, and so options are still more expensive despite overall volatility being lower.""  Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said markets are overestimating a pick up in volatility in the crypto market following the release of the U.S. inflation report on Thursday.  ""This year, ether [ETH] has declined by 1.5% on average in the week after inflation releases. The options market is currently pricing a post-inflation move of +5/-5% in ether,"" Thielen said. ""I would argue that the market is overpricing expected volatility and so I would be a volatility seller here.""  ""My favorite trade is to sell the ether $1,200 Oct 21 expiry put and sell the ether $1,400 Oct 21 expiry call,"" Thielen added. Traders sell call and put options when expecting a range-bound market.

42394654,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUkPM,1665569480,How Market Manipulation Led to a $100M Exploit on Solana DeFi Exchange Mango,"A rogue crypto trader utilized millions of dollars to manipulate the prices of Mango’s MNGO tokens on the namesake decentralized exchange (DEX) to eventually drain over $116 million in liquidity from the platform.  The exchange allows users to trade spot and perpetual futures using its on-chain trading interface at low fees. Some $30 million worth of crypto was traded on the exchange in the past 24 hours, as per CoinGecko data.  The move stemmed amid ongoing drama surrounding a bad debt within the Solana DeFi ecosystem that involved the lending application Solend and Mango.  As reported earlier this morning, Mango and Solend teamed up earlier this year to put together funds to bailout a large Solana whale that had $207 million in debt spread across multiple lending platforms – in a move that was supposed to backstop potential losses across the Solana ecosystem if the whale’s position were to be liquidated.  How the exploit took place  Solana-based Mango, like other DEXs, relies on smart contracts to match trades between decentralized finance (DeFi) users. This is key to understanding how the exploit took place: Smart contracts are wholly decentralized and are not overseen by a centralized party – which means a rogue trader can deploy enough money to exploit loopholes in any protocol without the risk of anyone stepping in to stop the attack before it takes place.  Two accounts were used to conduct the attack. On account “A,” the trader initially used 5 million USD coin (USDC) to purchase 483 million MNGO and go short, or bet against, the asset. Then on account “B,” the trader used another 5 million USDC to buy the same amount of MNGO, using 10 million USDC in total to effectively hedge his position, data on Mango pointed out by Genesis head of derivatives Joshua Lim shows.  The trader then used more funds to buy up spot MNGO tokens, taking its price from just 2 cents to as much as 91 cents within a ten-minute span. This was possible as spot MNGO was a thinly-traded token with low liquidity, which allowed the rogue trader to manipulate prices quickly.  As spot MNGO prices increased, the trader’s account “B” quickly racked up some $420 million in unrealized profits. The attacker then took out over $116 million in liquidity from all tokens available on Mango, which effectively wiped out the protocol.  Spot MNGO prices soon corrected back to 2 cents, falling under the prices that the trader first used to purchase MNGO futures on account “A.” That account sits at over $6 million in profit at writing time – but there’s no liquidity left in the platform to pay the trader out.  All in all, the rogue trader used over 10 million USDC to take out over $116 million from Mango, paying minimal fees for conducting the attack and doing everything within the parameters of how the platform was designed. Mango wasn’t hacked, it worked exactly as intended, and a savvy trader, albeit with nefarious intentions, managed to wring token liquidity out.  It’s important to note that the above manipulative strategy won't work on two centralized exchanges, because a trader placing high bids on one venue would mean prices automatically move higher on that exchange and other exchanges immediately raise the price of assets on their own systems – meaning the strategy is unlikely to net any profits.  Meanwhile, Mango developers said Wednesday that Switchboard and Pyth pricing oracles updated the benchmark price of MNGO to above $0.15, in line with the price hike on FTX and Ascendex. Oracles are third-party tools that fetch data from outside a blockchain to within it.  ""Neither oracle providers have any fault here. The oracle price reporting worked as it should have,"" Mango wrote on Twitter.  “The attacker pumped and dumped the mango token, which is a thinly traded token,” wrote Kanav Kariya, president at Jump Crypto, a crypto fund that has heavily backed Pyth, in a tweet.  “Oracles just report the price. Pyth/Switchboard accurately reported the prevailing prices on exchanges,” Kariya added. MNGO is down 40% in the past 24 hours.

Under the agreement, the Tron protocol is the island nation's ""designated national blockchain infrastructure."" An ordinance issued on the same day shows that the Tron network's native digital tokens were granted ""statutory status,"" meaning the tokens are now authorized for use as a medium of exchange in the country.  The government may accept Tron governance tokens such as TRX, BTT and JST, as well as stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar on Tron's TRC20 protocol such as USDT and USDD, as payment for public services including tax payments, the order says. Private enterprises can also accept these cryptocurrencies as payment ""where necessary infrastructure for transaction is available.""  With the endorsement, Tron is also set to issue Dominica coin (DMC), a blockchain-based fan token to ""help promote Dominica’s global fanfare for its natural heritage and tourism attractions,"" according to the government.  It is unclear how Tron was chosen for the task, but the ""open and cost-effective nature"" of the protocol will play a ""vital role to better integrate Small Island Developing States like Dominica into the global economy in the future,"" Dominica's Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said in a press statement.  Tron founder Justin Sun stepped down as the network's CEO to become Caribbean nation Grenada's ambassador to the World Trade Organization last year. He said at the time that he would focus on legitimizing crypto in Latin American countries.

Key Points: The Trust Wallet Token price action shows a retest phase of a broken resistance trendline. A cup and handle pattern with a neckline at $1 arises in the daily chart. The intraday trading volume in Trust Wallet Token is $8.58 million. Source - TradingView TWT Technical Analysis As mentioned in our previous analysis, the price trend reverses after a successful retest of the broken resistance trendline. Currently, the price trend remains within the 50 and 100-day EMA, projecting a consolidation range in the daily chart. However, the post-retest reversal candle shows higher price rejection from the 50-day EMA, reflecting a strong overhead opposition. Nonetheless, the spike in the trading volume supports the bullish launch from the broken trendline.

According to Grayscale, the SEC approaches spot Bitcoin ETPs with extreme severity and exceeds its statutory authority. On Tuesday, Grayscale&apos;s chief legal officer, Craig Salm, stated that if the SEC agrees with how futures contracts are valued by exchanges that allow spot market trades, it should be happy with the underlying asset. SEC Over Bitcoin ETF Refusal Salm argued that the allowance of futures without the approval of a spot ETF is a &apos;distinction without a difference in the context of Bitcoin&apos; because &apos;CME Bitcoin futures themselves are priced under the spot Bitcoin market.&apos; The business expanded on its position in the initial brief submitted in the lawsuit. In late June, the regulator turned down Grayscale&apos;s request to turn its flagship fund, GBTC, into an ETF. The business declared it would appeal the ruling the same day, making good on earlier threats to file a lawsuit. The argument in today&apos;s brief is that the 850,000 investors who already possess shares in the Trust would suffer because the SEC rejected GBTC&apos;s conversion.

Posting on Mango's governance proposal platform, the exploiter says they want Mango’s treasury to use its $70 million available in USDC to repay the bad debt within the protocol.  This bad debt stems from a bailout that Mango Markets and rival Solana lending platform Solend put together for a large Solana whale that had $207 million in debt spread across multiple lending platforms.  At one time the whale had borrowed 88% of the available USDC on Solend.  The bailout was put together over concern that should the SOL token drop by another 20%, the whale’s positions would be liquidated, which would cause contagion and adversely impact the Solana ecosystem.  As a result of this ongoing issue with Mango Markets, the Wormhole token bridge announced it is pausing transfers from Solana.  Part of the exploiter’s ultimatum seeks a promise from Mango it will not pursue a criminal investigation or freeze his funds.  Mango's MNGO token is down 38% on day.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $19,050, up ever so slightly over the past 24 hours. BTC continued to occupy the lower part of the $19,000 to $21,000 range it has occupied for much of the past month, a sign of ongoing market fears about rising prices and the prospect of a steep recession.  Markets' current rootedness comes as the release of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes on Wednesday and the latest Consumer Price Index on Thursday near. A surprise in either could move prices, although Federal Reserve bankers in their recent remarks have reiterated their commitment to prioritize staunching inflation, which they view as the biggest threat to the economy. The CPI is widely expected to fall slightly to 8.1% annually, not enough to reverse current central bank monetary hawkishness. The month-to-month price action is expected to inch upward.  ""Everyone is expecting another 75 bps [basis point increase] in November,"" Benoit Bosc, global head of product at crypto trader and market maker GSR Markets, told CoinDesk TV.  Ether was recently changing hands below $1,300, off slightly from Monday, same time. The second-largest crypto in market value has hovered over this threshold for much of October. Most other major cryptos were recently flat, albeit a little more to the red, with APE down more than 6% and POLY and XLM each falling about 5%.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is probing Yuga Labs, the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, over whether sales of its digital assets violate federal law, according to a Bloomberg report, citing an unnamed source close to the matter.  CHZ was recently up more than 4%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, was flat.  Stocks  Equity markets continued their recent losing streak with the tech-heavy Nasdaq declining 1.1% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average falling a few fractions of a percentage point. The Nasdaq returned to bear market territory for the second time this year, meaning it is down at least 20% from a previous peak.  Safe-haven gold was swept up in the decline of riskier assets, sinking 0.3%, while the yield on a 10-year Treasury, which travels inversely from crypto prices, rose to 3.94%, near its 2022 high. Later this week, early third-quarter earnings reports from PepsiCo, BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are expected show weakenings. Amid the current economic down notes, the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecast, warning that ""the worst is yet to come.""  Crypto news  Late Tuesday, Mango Markets, a decentralized finance platform hosted on the Solana Blockchain, appears to have been exploited for over $100 million. The exploit was the second in less than a week, following an $80 million breach last week of Binance’s BNB blockchain.  GSR's Bosc struck an optimistic note noting that bitcoin's price had fallen far further than the Nasdaq and S&P this year and so would likely improve sooner than the indexes as economic conditions rebound. ""There's better potential for crypto to decouple and for things to look better for crypto earlier than they will for the macro environment,"" he said, although he added that any progress was unlikely to occur for another six months.  He added: ""It's becoming clear that there are more and more buying opportunities especially for those [protocols} which are revenue generating and offer good value, pretty similar to the kind of TradFi opportunities that followed the great financial crisis in 2009.""

On the one hand, the amount of bitcoin active on exchanges hit a four-year low earlier this week. Typically, low balances on exchanges signify a coming price rally as traders have bought and are ready to HODL in order to benefit from an increase in price.  Other data points supporting a rally include the amount of bitcoin active during the past year, which hit another all-time high of 65.9%, according to Glassnode. The number of addresses holding over 0.1 coins has also increased, per Glassnode data, which shows the strength of conviction of bitcoin’s resilient ""minnows.""  The inconsistency likely reflects an uncertain and unprecedented macroeconomic climate in which indicators have often been pointing in opposite directions and investors remain averse to risk. Regardless, crypto markets are currently drawing less attention, at least for the time being, as the world waits for clear signals about inflation and the economy.  In a recent note, CryptoQuant highlighted the amount of leverage in the bitcoin market even as new users are not materializing.  “The estimated leverage ratio reached an all-time high. This shows the dominance of derivative market activity because of the lack of new retail investors,” CryptoQuant wrote. “However, the relatively 'neutral' funding rate seems to be the reason why the price movement has not yet found its direction despite this week's substantial exchange outflows and high leverage ratio.”  Investors will be scrutinizing the next release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index on Oct. 13 to see if the inflation data will move the markets.  CryptoQuant thinks it will, given the high leverage in play. Let’s see if this breaks us out of bitcoin’s sideways trading trap.

Two exploits less than one day apart - and less than a week after the BNB Chain exploit that utilized a bridge to create millions of new BNB. Another nine-figure exploit has rocked the crypto sphere, this time with Solana-based Mango Markets.

Let&apos;s look at this latest exploit and what we know in the early hours. The Price, Plus Pressure We&apos;re fresh off the heels of a massive, six-figure exploit of Binance Bridge that resulted in newly minted tokens in the range of $500M in value.

The combination with now this latest trio in October alone rings another stark reminder how much of a vital issue both smart contract security and risk management are in this space.

Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) June decision to reject its application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) “arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory"" in an opening legal brief filed as part of its lawsuit against the regulator.  Grayscale filed suit against the SEC on June 29, asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the regulator’s decision, which the SEC had published earlier in the day.  Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.  Grayscale is far from the only company whose spot bitcoin ETF application has been rejected – over the last year, the SEC has denied over a dozen similar applications from other major players in the crypto space, including WisdomTree and Ark21Shares, citing a lack of investor protections and the potential for fraud and manipulation.  WisdomTree's latest application was rejected the same day Grayscale filed its brief.  While the agency has repeatedly rejected bitcoin spot ETF applications, it has approved several bitcoin futures ETFs, making a distinction between the offerings that Grayscale’s lawyers say is “arbitrary” and “outside the Commission’s authority.”  In the brief, the attorneys argue that because bitcoin futures and spot bitcoin both generate their price based on overlapping indices, the spot price of bitcoin in both spot and futures ETFs are subject to the same risks – and therefore, approving one and denying another is unfair.  “The Administrative Procedure Act and Exchange Act require rules and regulations to be applied without favoritism for one type of product or another,” said Craig Salm, Grayscale’s chief legal officer, in a press statement.
