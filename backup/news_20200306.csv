42383432,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vabz,1583529344,That AlphaPoint $5.6M Funding Round? It's a Band-Aid,"CORRECTION (March 8, 21:45 UTC): An earlier version of this article misdescribed the form of bridge financing AlphaPoint obtained. It is a simple agreement for future equity (SAFE), not a loan, its CEO said.      The recent $5.6 million injection of capital into New York-based AlphaPoint was a form of bridge financing, the company confirmed to CoinDesk. But AlphaPoint would not say who provided the financing or its terms. Bridge financing is often used to cover financial shortfalls.      While bridge financing often comes in the form of a short-term loan, in this case it was a simple agreement for future equity (SAFE), convertible to stock when the company does its Series B round, CEO Igor Telyatnikov said.      Introduced just seven years ago by tech accelerator Y Combinator, SAFEs were initially meant for early stage startups, though they are increasingly used by some companies in place of convertible debt; SAFEs are quite similar to warrants. However for many companies using SAFEs, it can mean previous investors will nonetheless find their shares diluted.      “We can say that it was led by a new investor whom we cannot disclose with participation from existing investors including Galaxy,” Patrick Shields, head of marketing for AlphaPoint, told CoinDesk.      AlphaPoint, which provides digital asset trading software for cryptocurrency exchanges in various local markets, raised a $15 million venture round in June 2018 led by Galaxy Digital. Half of that amount was subsequently transferred to “a Galaxy managed fund” during the final quarter of 2018. Galaxy took a $3.1 million write-down that remained on the balance sheet in the third quarter of 2019, saying it “was due primarily to the company's performance being below forecast.”      During the announcement for the 2018 Galaxy round, executives touted the company’s blockchain-based asset issuance capabilities. Galaxy’s Greg Wasserman, who joined AlphaPoint’s board at the time, noted then that “the market opportunity for digitizing illiquid assets is tremendous.”      Several people who spoke to CoinDesk regarding this side of AlphaPoint’s business indicated these blockchain-based issuance efforts, such as a real estate tokenization project, have not been successful.      AlphaPoint’s core business depends on cryptocurrency trading volume, as its revenue model is based on charging customers, mostly small exchanges, monthly licensing plus a cut of trading fees. Volume on established exchanges like Bitstamp dipped lower as 2019 closed, and while recovering, have not seen the same levels since this past summer.      As well, several of AlphaPoint’s flagship customers have gone out of business. For example, Canada-based Einstein Exchange, which featured prominently on AlphaPoint’s homepage in 2018, collapsed in October, owing $12.4 million to its account holders. Another AlphaPoint customer, London Block Exchange, was liquidated in January.      Meanwhile, new sources of trading, such as derivatives platforms, over-the-counter (OTC) desks, securities exchanges and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are crowding into AlphaPoint’s core market.      The latest debt funding round comes after Binance’s announcement of its own solution for potential cryptocurrency exchange entrepreneurs. Called Binance Cloud, it allows local operators to use the company’s software and access its liquidity.      AlphaPoint CEO Igor Telyatnikov, who took on the top role last summer after a company restructuring, says its main rivals aren’t packaged software solutions like Binance Cloud but exchanges building software from scratch. “The biggest competitor is typically build-your-own exchanges versus buy,” Telyatnikov said.      As all cryptocurrency exchanges continue a relentless quest to add features and functions to entice traders, AlphaPoint is pushing its platform into areas its customers need to stay competitive. “The core matching engine, order management and order gateways are all one system that have different configurations depending on how customers want to deploy and use it,” he noted.      This enables AlphaPoint customers to run not just an exchange order book, but also a brokerage or an OTC service where the customer is facilitating all orders for its users. AlphaPoint said it serves over one million end users and enables 100 million annual trades for its customers.      Telyatnikov also told CoinDesk that AlphaPoint is planning on future capabilities to connect into DEXs and improve the overall flexibility within its software platform. He said many customers have development teams that code functionality to tailor AlphaPoint’s software for specific uses.      “The core focus for us is to develop and roll out liquidity, leverage and lending solutions,” said Telyatnikov. It’s a change from 18 months ago, when the movement to tokenize everything for the company seems to have faltered.      In addition to funding, Alphapoint also added some oversight: A new board member and new advisor. Tim Scheve, president and CEO who serves on the FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) Board of Governors, has joined the board. Jan Mayle, CEO and founder of consulting firm The Mayle Group, is now an advisor.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | BNB,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/06/that-alphapoint-56m-funding-round-its-a-band-aid,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83ca38ecc09bd13ad4778b09b587f7872214ff1a-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383417,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vaLd,1583529051,"IRS Crypto Summit Was About the Exchange of Ideas, Not Tax Guidance","WASHINGTON — “We might be overcomplicating things,” an audience member at the Internal Revenue Service’s crypto summit said midway through the first panel.      The IRS hosted four panels Tuesday, discussing technology, exchanges, the tax filing process and regulatory guidance in a daylong session uniting industry stakeholders, tax experts and regulators. The goal: Sort out some of the questions and concerns the broader crypto-holding public has about reporting its taxes.      While there were no answers and no new guidance for the industry (though virtual currency did make it to the IRS’s priority guidance plan published Friday), the event still represents a step forward for the opaque regulatory agency, which in a decade has only produced two pieces of binding guidance and published some non-binding documents for taxpayers and financial advisors.      “There’s a clear desire from both industry and regulators to understand this,” Chandan Lodha of CoinTracker told CoinDesk.      Financial advisers want to ensure they don’t have their clients fulfill costly reporting requirements only to discover they didn’t need to, EY partner Michael Meisler said during a panel. At another point a Coinbase vice president asked for clarity about reporting forms.      On the IRS side, numerous agency employees filled the auditorium with questions of their own, asking for clarity on how blockchain forensics works on a technical level, how privacy coins differ from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (BTC) and even just what specifically they could do to simplify the process for taxpayers.      There is some frustration on the industry side at the lack of existing guidance, and the event did not indicate that any new guidance will be forthcoming. Still, Lodha said the event was a positive step.      Unlike traditional panels, where a moderator asks panelists questions, the IRS event seemed geared from the outset to let audience members and even panelists ask IRS officials to clarify existing tax guidance and address lingering questions.    Calculations and filing    Specific questions included the best ways to calculate cost basis, how to treat coins bought from different exchanges or transferred between exchanges, whether microtransactions can be exempted and how to marry what tax code says with non-binding guidance published by the IRS so far.      “It would certainly be more helpful … if there was published guidance rather than just these frequently-asked-questions because in the absence of that, what we have is, ‘Well, this isn’t really authority,’” said EY’s Meisler, during a panel on tax return preparation.      It was a common refrain.      Audience members and panelists alike – including Kraken Head of Global Tax Lisa Askenazy Felix, Coinbase tax VP Kyle Zander and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) senior manager Amy Yiqiong Wang – said a lot of confusion stems from the fact that a lot of cryptocurrencies still don’t fall neatly into any existing tax laws.      “The rules don’t exist today to tell you exactly [how] to [file taxes],” Askenazy Felix said during a panel on exchanges.      EY’s Meisler told CoinDesk after the event that he believed it went well, noting IRS Assistant Deputy Commissioner John Cardone opened his panel by telling audience members the tax collector was looking for specific issues of interest to the industry.      “The people that were there from industry were asking questions that were very targeted, whether they develop software that conducts tax calculations or they were from exchanges, they were asking specific questions,” Meisler said.      One key detail that remains unclear is how exactly taxpayers can calculate the value of their digital assets.      The IRS has indicated in its frequently asked questions that individuals who buy and sell crypto at different times can use a method like “first-in-first-out,” meaning if you buy bitcoin in January, March and April and sell in July, August and September, you would calculate the difference in price between the first bitcoin you bought in January and the first bitcoin you sold in July.      However, this may not actually be allowable.      AICPA’s Wang said during a panel the tax code says users “should use specific identity,” meaning the cost should be calculated on the actual specific bitcoin being transacted.      “So there is no binding authority at the moment that allows you to use anything other than specific identification,” she said. “It’s really important for practitioners that the IRS comes out with clarity and guidance saying you can use other forms of tracking basis.”    'Sophistication'    While there were specific questions, various IRS officials also asked what the crypto industry might see as more basic questions – including “what is an API,” what regulatory arbitrage is and how cryptocurrencies are transacted.      “I'm getting the sense there's a wide array of sophistication in the room,” said Coinsource’s Arnold Spencer during a panel on technology updates.      Meisler told CoinDesk that having individuals who appeared to have different levels of understanding about the crypto space and technology is not surprising, and having everyone in a room together was likely a good thing.      “Before someone can answer ‘How do we tax cryptocurrency?’ or ‘How do we tax a hard fork or an airdrop?’ it’s helpful to understand what the mechanics of those transactions are,” he said.      It’s unclear whether the IRS will be able to publish anything actionable in the near future. However, there are some steps it can take immediately to clarify its existing guidance. Wang told CoinDesk that just moving its list of FAQs into the Internal Review Bulletin would provide some clarity, a view Meisler echoed.      Because the FAQs are not published in the bulletin, they’re not binding guidance; the IRS can change any recommendations on it as it wishes, which the agency has actually been doing, Wang said.      Some of the questions on the FAQ now appear at different points than when first published.      Turning these questions into binding guidance would give financial advisors and taxpayers the comfort of knowing they were looking at proper legal guidance, which could prevent them from inadvertently violating the tax code.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/06/irs-crypto-summit-was-about-the-exchange-of-ideas-not-tax-guidance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b39e9bf4891a155515768dc7faca8ac257b84ad-1530x1020.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After sharp gains in price Thursday, bitcoin (BTC) has been trading steadily in a range between $9,000 and $9,200. For the past 24 hours, bitcoin's price change has been minimal, down half a percent as of 18:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET).      Traders see bitcoin’s jump back into the $9,000 range as another sign bitcoin is trending upward in 2020 while traditional markets stumble. Year to date, bitcoin is up over 26 percent while the S&P 500 stock index is down 9 percent. Cryptocurrency sentiment appears bullish as prices remain above significant moving averages.      Although traders seem to be open to viewing the cryptocurrency markets as a safe haven from stock market turmoil, more volatility is possible ahead of May’s halving, an event that will slash in half the reward bitcoin miners obtain.      “It's a relief rally. In my opinion, we have a likelihood of sweeping another low before the post-halvening rally,” said Mostafa Al-Mashita of Canadian crypto brokerage firm Secure Digital Markets.      The S&P 500 closed down 3 percent Thursday as coronavirus fears reversed the small post-Super Tuesday rally. Equities traders cheered the results of the U.S. Democratic primary election favoring former Vice President Joe Biden over senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, candidates seen as openly hostile to capital markets. Also, bitcoin prices moved higher on optimistic banking news from India and positive regulatory clarity from South Korea.      “I believe gold and BTC are safe havens,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based crypto OTC trader. “As coronavirus has just started to spread, I believe a strong market will last well until the halving will have effect. To me it seems plausible that we can hit an all-time high this year, perhaps within six months.”      Gains in the cryptocurrency sector Friday include Lisk (LSK) in the green 4 percent, ether (ETH) up 2 percent, and bitcoin cash (BCH) appreciating 1 percent.

42383412,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vaGb,1583525422,Ethereum's ProgPoW Call Features Frustration but Little Progress,"ProgPoW is still just a proposal.      The controversial proposed change to Ethereum’s mining algorithm failed to change status after meeting resistance during Friday’s core developers call. Ethereum hard fork coordinator James Hancock said ProgPoW will not be included on the hard fork schedule going forward.      During the call, opponents of the long-discussed Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) voiced their frustrations.      “ProgPoW people are a bunch of profit-seeking miners lobbying the core dev political committee to get what they want – full stop,” said SpankChain CEO and MolochDAO co-founder Ameen Soleimani.      “A hard fork is not just a technical process,” said Martin Koppelmann, founder of open finance startup Gnosis. “A hard fork means creating a narrative around it – convincing 20,000 people at the same time that this is the best thing to do right now.”      Matt Luongo, founder of crypto venture studio Thesis, joined Soleimani and Koppelmann in voicing his concerns. Luongo compared current ProgPoW tensions to 2017’s bitcoin (BTC) civil wars, which led to the creation of bitcoin cash (BCH). Tweaking the Ethereum hash algorithm isn’t quite worth a chain split, he said.    The latest    As CoinDesk previously reported, ProgPoW’s code was released in 2018 as a replacement to the current Ethash mining algorithm. The code was proposed as a remedy to an emerging trend of mining-power centralization around ASIC-wielding firms.      Some Ethereum community members viewed this trend as dangerous to the community and an unfair advantage against less capital-endowed miners (who typically use GPU-based rigs). The concern can also be found in other cryptocurrency circles, notably with monero (XMR), which has built-in code changes every few months to disincentivize ASIC mining.      ProgPoW was nearly merged into Ethereum in January 2019, but failed at the eleventh hour due to third-party audits exposing key vulnerabilities. Earlier last month, ProgPoW popped back into the conversation as a hard fork candidate.      As of Friday, the EIP has been left on “final” status but has yet to receive core developer support to be executed as a major code change.    For and against    The common anti-ProgPoW argument centers on the transition to Eth 2.0 and its new Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.      Under PoS, mining ether (ETH) will become a thing of the past. ProgPoW antagonists think addressing the current Proof-of-Work chain when the community is nearing its major switch to PoS is superfluous, if not dangerous.      “We should focus on PoS and communicating the transition to PoS where mining rewards are decreased over time,” said Koppelmann. “That alone would prevent people from doing large investments in six- or eight-gigabyte ASICs.”      Pro-ProgPoW members – represented on Friday’s call by Kristy-Leigh Minehan, an algorithm developer who helped create ProgPoW, and cryptocurrency educator Michael Carter – say the Ethereum network is liable to be captured by ASIC miners.      Minehan said GPU mining is a common way for people to enter the Ethereum community. Hobbyists will be walled off from the Ethereum garden if an algorithm change isn’t made, she said.      Minehan also pointed out a forthcoming study from CoinMetrics on so-called nonce patterns in ethereum mining. In crypto mining, machines look for a nonce, or a specific golden number, to create a block and receive a coin reward. In some situations, you can tell what portion of a network is running a certain model of mining rig depending on the nonce patterns guessed by the machines. Minehan said the study from CoinMetrics suggests that 40 percent of the Ethereum network is running on Bitmain’s Antminer E3 miner, an ASIC.      Unfortunately, the E3 will become obsolete in the next few months, said Minehan and Carter, alluding to a recent report from mining pool 2Miners.      Minehan and Carter say they fear a more powerful ASIC miner will replace the E3, creating a tech cycle that iPhone users are quite familiar with: planned obsolescence. Cornering the network into changing products every time Bitmain produces a new mining rig undercuts the network’s security, they said.      This fear becomes even more pressing given the size of the Ethereum network, said Starkware product manager Louis Guthmann. Creating a GPU-friendly Ethereum is good for the network’s robustness, he said.      A compromise between the two camps was also given screen time on the call. Authored by Ben DiFrancesco, founder of software advisor ScopeLift, this middle path would make ProgPoW a testnet for the time being.      After further audits, the code would be issued as an emergency backup in case of an “ASIC attack” on the current Ethash algorithm. What an ASIC attack is remains unknown, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko pointed out.    Tl;dr    As of now, nothing has been decided.      Core developers on the call said they feel the community is fairly anti-ProgPoW. Without this support, a change cannot be implemented even if perceived as a net benefit to the network.      As the call closed, DiFrancesco pointed out that both parties have begun talking past each other, though there does seem to be agreement on one thing: nobody wants a contentious chain split.",NEGATIVE,BCH | ETH | XMR,BCH | ETH | MINING | XMR | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/06/ethereums-progpow-call-features-frustration-but-little-progress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ecd1713c45263b2f280676ddc14b83e2b3778a2e-2534x1614.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at the Bank for International Settlement's recent Future of Payments Forum, Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya argued a Japanese central bank digital currency (CBDC) currently has little merit.      CBDCs could greatly benefit developing countries, such as Cambodia, that have ""immature"" payment infrastructures, he said in a speech publicized Friday. But for advanced economies, the costs outweigh the benefits.      ""At this point, there is no need to implement new steps to ensure people's access to central bank money,"" according to a transcript of his speech. ""Moreover, the currency systems and the payment and settlement systems of these economies are operating safely and stably. They cannot simply jump into new technologies, or actually, they should not.""      Assuming CBDCs would operate at lower running costs compared to private initiatives, Amamiya continued, merchants would likely prefer CBDCs over private payment systems, both legacy and cryptocurrencies, but he said this would ""suppress private business and discourage innovations.""      If Japan introduced a digital yen, the central bank could also become the sole repository for the entire country's transaction information, raising concerns about how the BoJ would store and protect personal financial data, Amamiya added.    Threat from China    Amamiya's comments come after rising speculation that Japan was preparing to issue a digital yen. In February, senior politicians in the country's ruling Liberal Democratic Party filed a formal proposal for the government to issue its own digital currency in the face of a rising monetary threat from the planned digital yuan from China.      Amamiya previously ruled out a digital yen in 2018 when he argued it could undermine the country's two-tier financial system without providing additional benefits. In 2019, he said a move to a CBDC would only be viable if the whole country was prepared to abandon cash.      In his most recent comments, Amamiya argued there were benefits for countries already experiencing a significant decline in the use of cash to move over to a CBDC model. Sweden's e-krona initiative, he said, was one example where people who have struggled to adapt to cashless payments could be provided with ready access to central bank money.      While he doesn't favor a Japanese CBDC presently, Amamiya has advocated for more research into digital currencies. The BoJ was also one of six central banks to form a working group to share findings surrounding CBDCs earlier this year.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | RESEARCH,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/06/japan-doesnt-need-a-digital-yen-asserts-boj-official,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e181c2e225541bd2a1764ca1976f7773b773b25d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383420,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vaO9,1583515705,Overstock's VC Wing Leads $8.2M Funding Round in GrainChain,"GrainChain, a commodities tracing platform that uses smart contracts to open up liquidity for low-income farmers, has raised $8.2 million in its latest funding round, the company announced Friday.      Chief Executive and founder Luis Macias said the money will bolster GrainChain’s burgeoning operations in Mexico, Honduras and the southwest United States.      “This funding is really going to allow us to add to our operations and scale up the levels that we are anticipating, giving us the ability to implement across the entire supply chain,"" he said.      Overstock VC wing Medici Ventures contributed the bulk at $5 million. An early backer of GrainChain with a $2.5 million equity stake in late 2018, Medici had previously agreed to consider purchasing future equity. It now controls 17.65 percent of GrainChain, according to a Medici spokesperson.      Other new backers include Eden Block, according to a press release.      GrainChain envisions itself as a sort of glue between disparate actors in the agriculture supply chain. It brings farmers, bankers, insurers, exporters and trade associations on a unified blockchain platform where they can validate the movement of crops and commodities, and even make payments through event-triggered smart contracts.      In September, part of that vision took form as GrainChain inked deals with stakeholders from across the Honduran coffee industry. This included low-income farmers picking the beans, many of whom struggle to secure loans from bankers weary of supply chain inefficiencies.      Both farmers and bankers expressed hope at the time that GrainChain’s traceability trust factor could change that.      Medici CEO Jonathan Johnson said the VC got on board to help support GrainChain's efforts to ""eliminate middlemen and re-humanize commerce.""      Macias said the platform has attracted interest from more supply chain stakeholders in the time since. “People are excited about the implementation,” he said.      The new funding will also build out GrainChain’s global presence. Macias said he is currently brokering deals in two more countries that he expects to announce later this year.

For daily insights and unique perspectives listen or subscribe to the CoinDesk Podcast Network with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica, IHeartRadio or RSS.      There’s a common myth that women are less likely to be interested in bitcoin than men. The reality is people with higher income levels have a greater propensity for cryptocurrency, and women still earn significantly less than men.      Sexism isn’t only a problem in the so-called third world. A 2010 report by the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed roughly 11 percent of reports from women in abusive relationships came from upper-middle-class or wealthy households.      Globally, women still have fewer inheritance rights than men. According to the World Development Report in 2012, 5–45 percent of female respondents in any given jurisdiction said they didn't have control over their own income. Since financial abuse happens across income levels, two of the leading women executives in Silicon Valley share career advice and management tips.      Later, we'll discuss how crypto startups can recruit diverse women and recognize untapped talent.      For more, check out Leigh's article on women in the blockchain industry.

Announced Friday, Fang, who also serves as the San Francisco-based company’s chief operating officer, will replace current Chief Executive Tim Byun as of March 31. She will lead an effort to further develop the firm's crypto trading products for customers in more U.S. states, as well across Asia and Europe.      Byun will become global government relations officer (GGRO) of the exchange’s parent company, OK Group. There, he will focus on global growth and maintaining communications with governments and regulators internationally.      Prior to his time at OK Group, Byun was chief compliance officer for BitPay. Before that, he served as the anti-money laundering (AML) officer and head of credit settlement risk at Visa for over five years, according to his LinkedIn profile.      “As a foremost regulatory expert in the crypto industry, Tim Byun will take on the new GGRO role,” a spokesperson at OK Group told CoinDesk. “We will be able to better leverage his expertise across all units of business within the group.”      Originally founded in China, OK Group has a variety of crypto and blockchain businesses including trading, enterprise blockchains and mining. It has shifted toward blockchain technology in the county since the Chinese government banned crypto trading in 2017.      Fang joined the company in September. She most recently led the investment portfolios and strategic growth at Giant Network, a Chinese gaming company.      She comes with eight years of experience at Goldman Sachs, where she was focused on mergers and acquisitions, capital markets and restructuring, based in New York.      Byun helped OKCoin open its first U.S. office in 2017 and supervised its operations.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) – which issued an order to cut off crypto firms from the country's financial system in April 2018 – now says it plans to return to the Supreme Court to fight the Wednesday ruling that overturned its ban, according to an Economic Times report Friday.      The RBI will lodge a review petition over the court judges' ruling that the RBI had not been balanced in issuing the order, sources said. Concerns that the restarting of crypto trading could pose a risk to the banking system were cited as the primary reason behind the central bank's coming response.      Since Wednesday's ruling, some Indian cryptocurrency exchanges have already announced they have reinstated deposits and withdrawals via bank accounts. Local commentators are predicting a surge in crypto activity in India, where for two years exchanges have been forced to either close, leave the country or turn to solely crypto-to-crypto trading.      “This is the first step towards embracing cryptocurrency in India, which has the potential of becoming one of the largest crypto markets.” Ashish Singhal, chief executive of the CoinSwitch exchange, told CoinDesk after the court's ruling.

42383430,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vadF,1583494270,"Bitcoin Maintains Gains as Global Equities Slide, US Yield Hits Record Lows","Bitcoin is staying firmly in the green amid a strong sell-off in traditional markets.      The situation contrasts with last week when the top cryptocurrency by market cap had dropped sharply in tandem with equities and bond yields.      Bitcoin (BTC) found bids near $8,800 during Thursday’s Asian trading hours and rose above $9,150 later in the day. Since then, prices have largely stayed well above the $9,000 mark.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,100, representing a 2 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, having defended a brief dip to the psychological support of $9,000 at 01:00 UTC on Friday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      While bitcoin is looking bullish, the traditional markets are witnessing risk-averse trading, with a slide in equities and a rise in demand for gold and government bonds causing a drop in yields.      At press time, major European indices including Germany’s DAX, France’s CAC 40 and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 are down between 1.5 percent and 2.2 percent. Asian stocks took a beating earlier today, too, while futures on Wall Street benchmark index, the S&P 500, are currently down 1 percent.      Furthermore, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is currently trading at record lows below 0.8 percent, representing a 13 basis point drop on the day.      Gold, the classic safe-haven asset, is currently at an 11-day high of $1,681 per ounce.      So it's clear investors are selling risk and buying safe havens, likely because the coronavirus outbreak is starting to threaten to become a global pandemic and could cause far greater damage to the world economy than previously expected.    Bitcoin a safe haven or risk asset?    Bitcoin’s (much-debated) safe-haven narrative could strengthen again, given the cryptocurrency is flashing green amid the risk aversion in equities and the rising odds of an additional Federal Reserve rate cut. The interest rate market thinks the Fed will again cut rates by 50 basis points at its March 18 policy meeting, having delivered an emergency cut earlier this week.      The crypto market community stands divided on whether bitcoin is a pro-risk or an anti-risk asset.      Prominent observers including Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital are of the opinion bitcoin is a hedge against monetary easing, while billionaire investor Michael Novogratz believes the cryptocurrency is an anti-risk or safe-haven asset.      These arguments, however, could be challenged on the fact that bitcoin failed to score gains during last week’s stock market sell-off. The S&P 500 fell by 4 percent last week and bitcoin tanked by 13 percent in parallel.      And while the coronavirus scare dominated market sentiment throughout February, the cryptocurrency suffered an 8.5 percent slide.      “If we look at the behavior of the bitcoin price over the last couple of weeks, as concerns over a global pandemic have ramped up, it is clear that bitcoin continues to behave more like a high-risk investment than like the safe haven which it promises to be,” CoinDesk columnist and co-founder of the Open Money Initiative Jill Carlson noted earlier this week.      That said, bitcoin has not had a strong positive correlation with equities either. For instance, the cryptocurrency fell from $13,000 to $6,500 during the second half of 2019, even though the S&P 500 rallied by nearly 10 percent.      All in all, bitcoin appears to not be strongly correlated with other asset classes. It could yet become a safe haven, although that would require a deep investment in education, according to Carlson.      From a technical analysis perspective, the cryptocurrency looks set to extend the ongoing rise toward higher resistance levels.    4-hour chart    Bitcoin bounced up from $9,000 early Friday (marked by arrow), reinforcing the case for a rally to $9,550 put forward by an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout confirmed on Thursday.      The breakout is also backed by an above-50 or bullish reading on the relative strength index.    Daily chart    Bitcoin is looking north with the MACD histogram producing higher lows in favor of the bulls. Further, the five-day average has crossed above the 10-day average, signaling a bullish shift in sentiment.      Resistance at $9,312 (Feb. 4 low) could be put to test over the weekend. A violation there would expose the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout target of $9,550.      Alternatively, if prices find acceptance under the former hurdle-turned-support of the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline $9,000, some buyers may exit the market, yielding a pullback to the 200-day average at $8,704.      A close under $8,410 (Sunday’s low) is needed to invalidate the bullish reversal doji pattern confirmed on March 2. That would signal a continuation of the drop from February highs near $10,500.

42383416,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vaKN,1583488800,Information Overload Is Stopping Us From Seeing the Truth,"Yorke Rhodes III, a CoinDesk columnist, co-founded Blockchain at Microsoft and is principal program manager, Azure Blockchain engineering and board member of Blockchain for Social Impact Coalition and Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, and founding team member of baseline protocol.      Congratulations, we’ve arrived in 1984.      Books, television and movies have foreshadowed our eerie relationship with technology since long before 1984. The idea of a reality so perfectly created you can’t tell it is manufactured has long been the stuff of science fiction. You need look no farther than films like “The Matrix,” “Total Recall” or “Inception.” While real life attempts at pervasive virtual reality have largely failed outside of gaming, things are going swimmingly well in the world of data manipulation. Our perception of reality is now shaped by the data we willingly consume from unquestioned sources across social media, news and video.      Congratulations, he says to himself, this new reality has arrived in your lifetime. We now live in a world where people speak their truth. I applaud people speaking their truth, especially people speaking truth to power, but what is the objective truth? What does the phrase objective truth mean now and how do we arrive at it?      Some philosophers will disagree there can be an objective truth: It is all about perception. For simplicity, let us say it is an attribute of reality that all people can agree on, whether they have met or had a shared experience. Know that your truth may not be the same as their truth. This is about lived experiences.      Regardless, we must share our truth and speak truth to power even though it may disrupt the status quo. Cue Greta Thunberg. Her fortitude in bringing light to the science of climate change amidst trolls, skeptics and science deniers provides a stunning example of speaking truth to power.    Information is so dense that most people cannot consume enough to ferret out what is real.    In the United States, our court systems mete out justice circumstantially based on the many variables at play in courtrooms. The biggest variable is information presented and withheld, and what jurors can be convinced to believe. My legal colleagues would agree this is simply a legal proceeding designed to determine the truth of whether a defendant committed the crimes charged. This isn’t about truth but about the presentation of a set of information to jurors and their perception based on data. This is the system we have, but it is clearly about creating a reality and perception of the circumstances based on a select set of data.      In contract law, truth means sticking to the terms of the contract. Agreement about a common state of things defined by a contract is, in this case, the truth. Arriving at that common understanding of the truth often involves a great deal of effort by both parties to a contract. In many cases, the data don’t support a single view of the truth, so the parties agree to split the difference or disputed values and continue on contracting the next month. This is a pretty sad state of affairs caused simply by not having a common set of data to determine the truth of what happened.    The problem is information overload    It’s an old meme that on the internet no one knows you are a dog. Since search became prevalent on the internet, the question of who you are has been answered through available data. Creating a positive perception about yourself or your business on the internet is possible, even if the reality is different. Even fixing reputation can be solved by creating many positive references and getting them to rank high or show up on the first few pages of searches. Do this with enough good references and the negative references become invisible to most casual searchers. This isn’t an information asymmetry problem, it is a stack overload problem for our brains. There is too much information overloading our circuits. This overload pervades everything we do daily and creates our reality.      This is the problem with social media. It presents a few short data points without much substance. If the source, posting organization or individual is credible or supposedly believable, and the sound bite is good, it can become viral. This unverified sound bite then pervades more and more information feeds to more and more people. If this sound bite is repeated enough, it becomes people’s reality. Even worse, if historically trusted sources are taken over by people with different interests, what was once a credible news outlet can use that credibility to advance questionable sound-bites into our collective psyche. We have seen plentiful examples of the impact of this. Fox News now looks more like RT, the @potus Twitter account bears little semblance to an official presidential account. Sinclair Media requires “talking points” of a particular political group to be injected into local radio broadcasts.    No amount of digital uniqueness, truth machine, and magical internet money will save us from ourselves    Al Gore’s plan for the Information Superhighway was legislated to solve a commercial problem with political will. It was meant to bridge the digital divide to advantage those without access to the internet. The goal was to remove a blind spot to the digital world of information. But the superhighway we envisioned has become a landfill of soap boxes and used car salesmen hawking their next “promotion” or scam.      The road isn’t clogged, our brains are saturated. Information is so dense that most people cannot consume enough to ferret out what is real, let alone validate the actual source crafting that reality. And this is only getting worse in the form of fake news, questionable information sources across our media, credible sources taken over, promotions disguised as good causes, charity washing, and more recently the risk of deep fakes.      We haven’t escaped this problem in our little blockchain-cryptocurrency bubble of the world. The exact same symptoms exist here. All one has to do is look at Crypto Twitter. How can anyone not well versed in the history, personalities, names, and background material possibly make an informed decision based on the data presented?      No amount of digital uniqueness, truth machine, and magical internet money will save us from ourselves, and from being bought by others. It’s not like we don’t see this happening every day in our politics, passions and, yes, in our blockchain bubble. If we can’t find a way to create inherent trust into the data we feed our brains, our worst instincts will overwhelm our ability to change the world.      I have some ideas. Join me on a journey to find out how trust-bearing technologies can help transform our digital and physical world and maybe just, just maybe, help save our planet.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Yorke Rhodes III,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/06/information-overload-is-stopping-us-from-seeing-the-truth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df783c0fd72d957846651e07c03af95be67b46bd-1500x1114.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383419,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vaPP,1583485200,INX's $130M IPO to Launch Next Month as Exchange Seeks NY BitLicense,"INX Ltd. has entered the home stretch for its $130 million initial public offering (IPO), potentially the largest registered securities sale by a company in the blockchain sector.      The cryptocurrency and security token exchange startup is targeting an April launch date for the IPO, people familiar with the situation said. INX is about to kick off a series of presentations to potential investors, known as a roadshow, which was originally supposed to start in January, the sources said. The firm has hired a European investment bank to act as lead underwriter for the IPO, they said.      INX is positioning itself as a mature, dutifully compliant exchange eschewing the “beg forgiveness, don’t ask permission” practices that have defined the crypto industry for most of its history. Unlike the initial coin offerings (ICO) that claimed exemptions from securities laws by arguing their tokens weren’t investments or by selling only to wealthy investors, INX is registering with the SEC so it can solicit the general public. The process has taken the company two years.      Doubling down on compliance, the company plans to relocate its headquarters from the blockchain-friendly jurisdiction of Gibraltar to New York, INX disclosed in its prospectus, which was updated on Monday. That means it will have to obtain a state BitLicense to serve residents, and it is in talks with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to obtain one, the people familiar with the situation said.      This is the regulatory equivalent of transferring from a community college to MIT. Only about 20 BitLicenses have been granted since the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) finalized its regulation in 2015, although regulatory sources said the agency has assembled a team to expedite applications. Exchanges including Kraken and ShapeShift stopped doing business in New York, calling the license’s requirements onerous, and NYDFS recently began to reassess its rules.      In December, the deadline passed for the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register objections to INX’s prospectus, filed over the summer. With no comments received from the SEC, the company was free to proceed with the offering, which will be sold in the form of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.    Cast of characters    The proceeds from the IPO would fund the launch of a crypto exchange, known as INX Digital, and security token platform, INX Securities. In preparation, INX has lined up several partners.      For example, INX has tapped Anchorage and BitGo to custody digital assets on behalf of the exchange’s clients, people familiar with the exchange said. Anchorage confirmed its involvement, and INX named BitGo in an SEC filing.      Further, Tokensoft is providing design and tech advisory services and Quantstamp will audit the exchange’s smart contract code, according to the filing.      INX’s token would be listed on its own security token platform and on other exchanges, according to the sources.      Holders of INX’s tokens would get a share of the company’s profits and stand in line ahead of equity investors for repayment in the event of bankruptcy; the tokens would also be accepted as payment for trading fees.      Meantime, INX has obtained money transmitter licenses in eight U.S. states so its crypto exchange will be allowed to handle fiat on-ramp and crypto-to-crypto transactions, the filing said.      The exchange would initially list the top 10 coins by market capitalization and add other coins and derivatives later, according to the filing.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/06/inxs-130m-ipo-to-launch-next-month-as-exchange-seeks-ny-bitlicense,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d6a429341025602bf446aec7713f5cb2719defb-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383431,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vaeV,1583474400,"Nike, Macy's Run Blockchain Trial With Auburn's RFID Lab","Blockchain might help major apparel brands from Nike to Macy’s better share product data across the retail supply chain, according to a white paper Auburn University’s RFID Lab published Wednesday.      The study, named the “Chain Integration Project"" (CHIP), saw those retailers and others run Hyperledger Fabric nodes on a slice of their mammoth supply chains. The study found blockchain to be a promising way to share serialized data after following tens of thousands of products including Nike Kids’ Air Force 1 shoes and Michael Kors parkas as they moved between distribution centers.      RFID Lab is one of the most prominent outposts for U.S. retailers’ experiments with emerging supply chain tech, but Blockchain Fellow Allan Gulley said it’s a relative newcomer to distributed ledger technology. And so CHIP, which began in 2018, became a blockchain trial by fire for the Auburn research institute.      Many retailers have already been keeping internal tabs on product movements via radio frequency identification (RFID) tags installed in every unit. As one example, Gulley said every box of Nike shoes comes with an RFID tag that helps the athletics giant track its sprawling inventory. However, different retailers tags store data differently and there’s little to no data interoperability.      “Everyone was speaking a different language.” Gulley said. “The way they sent data to us was wildly different from one company to another. There wasn’t a good common language in place and there wasn’t a common platform for them to share that data.”      That gave the RFID Lab two opportunities: Build retailers a common language, and build them a platform.      The language aspect took up about 70 percent of the researchers’ time, Gulley said. With the help of the many students who operate the lab, Gulley’s team built a ""translator tool"" that reworks different data streams into the EPCIS standard developed by Belgian non-profit GS1.      Implementing Hyperledger Fabric was simpler but still came with its own set of dilemmas, Gulley said. Rookie-level bugs throttled the system’s initial transaction throughput – the team was measuring in seconds per transaction instead of transactions per second – but optimization increased throughput by over 6,500 percent.      “We realized pretty quickly how unproven the blockchain technology really is,” Gulley said.      He compared this study to other high-profile blockchain supply chain trials, like the IBM Food Trust. Those systems track shipments in sum. Gulley said CHIP, which looked at reams of data for specific products, was far more “granular,” and as such more complex.      In the final design, each retail pair had a different ""channel"" where the pair could run its own closed proof of concept. Nike’s vertically integrated supply chain was all in-house, but more interlinked retailers and brands had support from tech vendors and others.      The proof of concept ultimately saw thousands of products matched across its nodes. Nike recorded 72,575 items from encoder to distribution center; PVH and Kohl’s recorded 3,766; and Macy’s, which had the trial’s most complex supply chain of – a HermanKay distribution center, a Macy’s distribution center, and a Macy’s store – matched 62 products across all three, according to the study.      In total, 222,974 items were written onto the blockchain, according to the study. It needs to take on more, though, if it is to go mainstream.      “The system as it stands right now can process what we need it to, but in the long term we're talking about billions of products flowing through the retail supply chain with these RFID tags. There needs to be a much more robust system in place to handle that,” Gulley said.      RFID Lab will now take its blockchain study to a “consultancy” phase of sorts, trying to understand just how much value DLT and RFID data sharing systems can offer the businesses, who, by virtue of their size, can reap millions of dollars in efficiencies with only minor tweaks to their business practices.      Gulley predicted blockchain’s long-term viability in the supply chain space will rely on a more robust network of service providers being there to assist its growth.      “For the next phase of this work there's absolutely going to have to be more involvement and engagement from technology players. If this thing continues to grow beyond a handful of nodes and a handful of operators it's going to get big pretty fast.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/06/nike-macys-run-blockchain-trial-with-auburns-rfid-lab,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b6ad62f125c16e3eef4f173db81bc6bec957bed-1426x924.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383428,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vaWx,1583467438,Clearview AI Lawyer Tor Ekeland Says Your Face Is Public Property,"Clearview is the newest company in the surveillance space we love to hate.      The app, an ""after-the-fact research tool,"" allows thousands of government and corporate agencies to match photos of suspected criminals against a catalog of 3 billion images culled from the internet. A New York Times report found more than 600 police agencies have started using Clearview last year, and Buzzfeed expanded that list to over 2,000 clients, including such firms as Macy's and Walmart, as well as organizations like Interpol.      ""Clearview is not a surveillance system and is not built like one,"" according to the company website, which claims the firm only scrapes images from public websites. Still, questions around the Clearview's cybersecurity have been raised and validated.      Last week, it came to light that an unknown actor gained ""unauthorized access"" to the facial recognition firm’s entire client list. While the hacker’s location and motivations are unknown, if found, it’s likely the individual will be indicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), Tor Ekeland, Clearview’s legal representative, said in a phone call.      The CFAA is a federal statute used to prosecute computer hackers. Enacted two years after Apple Macintosh hit the shelves but before the internet, the law prohibits accessing a computer without permission as well as the unauthorized deletion, alteration or blocking of privately stored data.      Ekeland rose to prominence in the past decade as an outspoken critic of the CFAA. He’s called the law vague and problematic, and said it could be used as a cudgel to stifle political speech.      A former corporate lawyer specializing in securities law, Ekeland has made a career defending controversial computer criminals. His first client was Andrew “Weev” Auernheimer, a self-described neo-Nazi troll, who Ekeland took on pro bono. Auernheimer exploited a flaw in AT&T’s security to collect user’s personal information left exposed on a public website.      Wired dubbed Ekeland, a reformed alcoholic and ex-experimental theater producer, “The Troll’s Lawyer.”      The heart of Ekeland’s defense of Auernheimer was based on constitutional principle: The CFAA’s language is so broad and has been amended so frequently it fails to meet the reasonable standard of defining what’s prohibited.      Sentenced to more than three years in prison, Auernheimer’s case was overturned on appeal, though the CFAA went unamended. In the years since, Ekeland has become the go-to lawyer for hackers indicted under this ill-defined law.      He represented Matthew Keys, a former Reuters social media editor, accused of assisting Anonymous hackers access the Los Angeles Times website without permission. He has spoken publicly in Julian Assange’s defense, writing that “prosecuting Assange for a computer crime sidesteps the elephant in the room: This is the prosecution of a publisher of information of interest and importance to the public about our government.”      “Unfortunately, data breaches are part of life in the 21st century,” Ekeland told the Daily Beast, following the Clearview hack. Nothing if not consistent, Ekeland is still amenable to hackers, even if standing on the other side of the conversation.      Likewise, he defends Clearview’s controversial business practice of scraping images from social media and third-party vendor websites, as protected under the First Amendment. It’s all publicly available information, he said.      “I mean, first of all, the common law has never recognized a right to privacy for your face,” Ekeland said. “It's kind of a bizarre argument to make because [your face is the] most public thing out there.”      Ekeland’s philosophical consistency sidelines the facts. Clearview’s security protocols are untested, unregulated and now proven unreliable. The company houses three billion images to feed an AI-powered surveillance tool used by corporate and state actors; now its client list has been published, showing once more it can’t be trusted to maintain user privacy. It even has Congress's alarm bells ringing.    He would've been better off taking a lead pipe and beating the shit out of his boss. He would've faced less time.    Still Ekeland is willing to defend his client, as he has defended many controversial figures before. What follows is an edited and condensed transcript of our phone conversation.      What’s your beef with the CFAA?      Well, the central offense of the CFAA is that it doesn't define its central prohibitions, right? It doesn't define what constitutes unauthorized access to a computer or what exceeding authorized access to a protected computer is. Saying that exceeding unauthorized access to a protected computer is exceeding your permission, that's a circular definition.      When you have squishy statutory terms that are left to the courts to determine, you get conflicting interpretations made by judges who know nothing about computer science but think they do.      There are clerks who think they understand network computers because they've got a smartphone or they type on a computer. Those definitions often shock people who work professionally in information security. One of the biggest problems is people go to physical-world concepts to come up with definitions of digital networks, but the analogy breaks down in security concerns. Our common law didn't evolve based on a series of networked nodes whose primary purpose was the transmission of communications and the search and retrieval of information.      [These definitions] are highly contingent on people's perceptions and paradigms. And it's just not at all black and white. It's obvious if I adopt your emotional and moral and legal presuppositions, there's a conceptual, definitional incoherence for central prohibitions in the CFAA.      The problem with that is it seems to criminalize de minimis behavior. It can be read to criminalize temporarily deleting a letter from a Word document. So it's like this really draconian statute that has really draconian penalties that quite often are not proportionate to the harm inflicted.      Like Keys' case, where he was alleged to have provided login information to access the Tribune Media Company websites. In my opinion, Tribune was totally negligent in their infrastructure and security. The Federal government came up with, like, a five year initial sentencing recommendation. He got sentenced to two years, for what started out as an employment dispute. He would've been better off taking a lead pipe and beating the shit out of his boss. He would've faced less time.      It's a law that's written first in 1984 and has been modified a little bit since, but it's before Facebook or Google, before smartphones, and it's very antiquated.      You’ve made the argument in the past it could be used as a political tool to control and silence speech.      It certainly can be used for that.      Am I right in my assessment that the Clearview hacker would be charged under the CFAA?      Oh yeah. In my opinion, he committed a straight-up felony under it. He had [unauthorized] access to a protected computer. But here’s the key difference, and I think this is where there's some confusion for you.      The argument that the public should have access to public data on the internet. Right? In the Weev case, he downloads 114,000 email addresses from a publicly facing server without any security on it. That, in my opinion, is completely legal because the public has a First Amendment right to access public information on the public internet that's not marked private.      If the government came in and told you what books you could check out of the library or what art you could look at at the art museum, you'd say that’s censorship. But distinguish that from somebody hacking in and getting my private data. The argument that information should be free and that the public should have public access to public data is not an argument that says there should be no privacy.      You could argue the public has a right to know who is on the client list of Clearview. Right?      Why? Submit the argument, make the argument, what's the argument?      Because they've scraped three billion images from millions of people. And we don't exactly know how they are being used or stored.      Do you know exactly the images that Clearview indexed? They just indexed the public internet. You have complete access to the same dataset that Clearview indexed.      Your argument is that because you don't like a particular use of information, public information on the public internet should be restricted. Do you know what that propositional structure is? It’s censorship. Censorship is when the state comes in and dictates whether or not somebody can read or hear something or use information because the state deems it morally or legally harmful in some way.      This is Weev’s case. And I’ve been consistent across the board in every one of my fucking cases. Now people say that we can't use, say photos, that are publicly posted on the internet.      I mean, first of all the common law has never recognized a right to privacy in your face. To argue that your face is private is kind of a bizarre argument to make because [it's] really the most public thing out there. A lot of the people are now making arguments about privacy in terms of faces, but were silent on the issue of revenge porn or non-consensual sexual images of women. What they said was that the women had no property rights and they had no privacy rights and their recourse was the fucking copyright law, thanks to CDA [Section] 230, [which reduces platform liability for what’s posted online.] So all these people who are now all of sudden hot to trot, ‘Oh my gosh, faces are private,’ could give a shit when women's lives were destroyed by revenge porn.      A right to privacy in your face has never happened in the law. That's a new thing that people are making up now. I get the right to privacy in our sexuality, because we all fucking wear clothes, right? But that goes back centuries. So the logic is really fucked up and skewed here.      You’ve said in the past Google could be prosecuted under the CFAA. As the law exists and as it's interpreted, Clearview probably could be, too?      Oh, that was a risk case. And that's what I fought against. Have you read hiQ v LinkedIn? Essentially what hiQ stands for is: you've got a First Amendment right to access public information on the public internet. It's different if that information is marked private and you bypass privacy restrictions. But Clearview doesn't do that. I think the CFAA issue is dead, honestly, for Clearview because unless the Ninth Circuit is wrong in its reasoning in hiQ v LinkedIn. [Clearview claims to only scrape data from public web pages.] So you're back to the fundamental paradigm of what gives the state the right, or anyone the right, to determine access to a public library or public art museum based on the fact they think the use of that information is harmful.      There is no case law that recognizes a biometric exception to First Amendment protections. What's going to stop the state once it starts with [putting limits on accessing] biometric information from deciding that it wants to regulate speech in other areas outside of recognized exceptions to the first amendment, which is speech of constituted criminal conduct, fraud, defamation, obscenity? It's a lot more complicated than all these people wandering around making up privacy rights out of their ass that they haven't theorized, that they haven't reconciled with the First Amendment, and are based on facts of computer functionality that they don't understand.      Clearview is accessing public information, but it’s not clear what it's doing with it. It's building a tool that could be used for surveillance that could eventually infringe on people's rights. That's the concern.      First of all, there's a really intense surveillance tool called Facebook. Facebook is a surveillance tool that all government intelligence and surveillance agencies would love to create. And now the private sector has created it for them.    Facebook is a surveillance tool that all government intelligence and surveillance agencies would love to create. And now the private sector has created it for them.    It's surveilling you 24/7, reading the barometric pressure from your phone and finding out what floor of the building you're on. You know, if you're talking on a smartphone, you're already under surveillance.      So now you're telling me that is an act of surveillance to index and search photos from the past. And then provide a URL link to that public entity. We're not talking about surveillance here. Because all Clearview is doing is taking the public title frame, the public image and the public URL. So now explain to me how that constitutes surveillance. If you're walking down the street looking at people, is that surveillance?      Well, it's what they're building. It's AI that has people worried.      Clarify that concept, because that's an incoherent statement to me and that's a conclusory statement. When you say what it is we're building, what do you think they're building?      I couldn't say for sure. That's why Congress has asked Clearview to clarify its business.      That's the problem. People have the feeling they can't articulate, that they can't coherently present. And maybe that feeling is right. The problem is that when you act on these kinds of feelings and you start moving into the law, you get all sorts of unintended consequences.      You've said in the past one flaw of the CFAA is that its punishments are not proportional to the actual harm done. Could you state what the harm is of a hacker breaking into Clearview?      What the harm is? Again, I'm not going to make a statement on that at this point in time. It's a particular case, but I do stand by that the punishment should be proportional to the harm. Absolutely. One good example of this is how the U.K. treats its hackers, as opposed to the U.S. Are you familiar with Mustafa [Al-Bassam]?      No, sorry.      Look it up some time. He was part of the Lulzsec and Anonymous hacker groups in 2010, 2011. They hacked Rupert Murdock’s News of the World and ran his obituary. They hacked all sorts of stuff. So Mustafa is finishing up his computer Ph.D. and working on selling his second startup and is a productive member of society, [when he was arrested]. If he'd been prosecuted in the United States for his crimes, he'd still be in jail.      I’ll end with a line that I say all the time, if the United States was prosecuting computer crimes in the 1970s like it does now, there would be no Microsoft, there would be no Apple, because all these tech bros started out hacking. Bill Gates put a virus out on a corporate computer network when he was a teenager. I’ve yet to meet a good coder who didn't learn by taking systems apart.      There's also an economic argument. These prosecutions are bad for the economy. Finally, I think most of these cases should just be civil, unless you're messing with the hospital or taking out a power grid or something that actually causes harm. This puritanical desire to punish runs rampant in the U.S. judicial system. And it's unfortunate and it's why we've got more people incarcerated per capita than almost any nation in the world, including China, Russia and all those oppressive regimes.      I need to go into a meeting now. You can follow up with me later, I'll talk about this until the cows come home.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/06/clearview-ai-lawyer-tor-ekeland-says-your-face-is-public-property,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4838880087f4eff7d613d6398d0f17bea9bcac3a-1872x1122.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
