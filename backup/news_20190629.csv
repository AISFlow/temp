42382230,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r0nR,1561802749,Facebook's Libra Crypto Code Draws Critiques and Clones on GitHub,"The early-access code for Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency hit GitHub two weeks ago – and in that time, critics and would-be trollers have taken aim at the project.  Spun up by the social media giant and presently managed by the non-profit Libra Association, the project on GitHub has been saved or “starred” by close to 10,000 users, signifying an early wave of interest among open-source participants. Additionally, over 1,000 clones of the codebase have been created thus far as technologists sit down to experiment with Libra’s code.  In fact, some of those playing with the code have moved to add features previously found in systems like bitcoin, such as open network access for block validators.  Some of these efforts, though, aren’t meant to be wholly serious efforts. Mikko Ohtamaa, who created a so-called “Libra Classic,” told CoinDesk in an interview that the effort was “a complete troll” and meant to be taken as a joke.  To this point, Albert Castellana, chief product officer at cryptocurrency startup Radix DLT, remarked:  “There have been no real code flaws submitted so far, mostly build issues or typos, and then some critics pointing out that this is not a decentralized solution.”  Envisioned to support a new global financial payments system, Libra is designed such that at launch a group of 28 founding members will be responsible for validating transactions and appending new blocks – at least at first, with Facebook expressing hope that the network will grow to be more decentralized over time.  In comparison, the original bitcoin network – also designed to be a global financial payments system – enables any individual with computational resources to take part in the never-ending process of creating and broadcasting blocks of transactions (and earning fresh bitcoins in the process).  For this reason, several community members in the cryptocurrency space have directly criticized the permissioned structure of the Libra blockchain not just on social media but on GitHub by nitpicking through every detail of the network's codebase.  To troll a social media behemoth  On GitHub, any user with ""read"" permissions to a code repository can create issues and pull requests.  Issues, as the name suggests, tag problems in code or areas in need of enhancement. Pull requests, on the other hand, suggest changes to a code repository that reviewers with ""write"" or ""admin"" permissions can either approve or reject.  Over the past four days, roughly 160 issues have been flagged with the Libra codebase. Over 100 of them have been closed by authenticated users of the codebase, with a handful of these additionally marked as “off-topic.”  While there have been only half as many pull requests to the Libra code repository, some of these reinforce the sentiment shared by those in the cryptocurrency community who believe permissioned blockchain protocols are inherently flawed.  GitHub user “gazhayes” opened up a pull request Tuesday writing:  “I’ve discovered an alarming vulnerability, but fortunately there’s a really simple fix. ... This problem can easily be solved by using a permissionless system where the hard power is decentralized across a very large number of participants.”  The pull request was closed and the resulting conversation was marked off-topic on Wednesday by the official Libra GitHub administrator, which led to complaints by those who deemed gazhayes’ post as a legitimate remark.  “By locking [pull request] #83, it indicated that the maintainers are not open to differing viewpoints and experiences,” wrote decentralized application developer Marcus Newton.  In response, Ben Maurer, tech lead for Calibra – a subsidiary of Facebook dedicated to building a wallet application for the Libra blockchain – insisted:  “We're really cognizant of the fact that this is a transformative effort and that we need to build a community around it,” Maurer wrote. “But having discourse doesn't mean the lack of moderation. Off-topic conversations detract from fruitful ones. The thread on #83 was not productive and would have tied up moderation resources.”  Questions remain  Agreeing with this sentiment, Ohtamaa noted that the real efficacy of open-source collaboration on GitHub for the Libra project remains to be seen.  “People just hate Facebook so much that they’re trolling the GitHub [repository],” said Ohtamaa. “All the comments [right now], it’s not a discussion, just angry arguments.”  But with time, Ohtamaa is adamant that with further code specifications further contextualizing how the Libra network will function, the haters will have “no room for argument.”  “From now on, the development will happen in open,” insisted Ohtamaa. “It was basically a code dump but now they are … letting everybody else in and Facebook has a very good reputation when it comes to open source projects.”  Still, by all appearances, there remain unanswered questions surrounding the code that will underpin Facebook’s ambitious project.  Jameson Lopp, CTO of crypto security startup Casa, told CoinDesk in an email that “there's still a lot of missing information regarding the Move language.”  “There's also a big question around whether or not people who are not validators will be able to run nodes that download all of the ledger states and check them,” he said. “There are also questions around whether or not that ‘replica node’ mode of operation will also be able to download the blocks created by validators.”  Speaking to some of the immediate next steps for the now open-sourced project, Alexandru Voica, communications manager at Facebook, told CoinDesk:  “One specific thing we can share is that we plan to add a new command line interface for the Move language that should allow a developer to more easily play with the Move language in their own development environment.”  Aron van Ammers, CTO and co-founder of Outlier Ventures, contended that it’s still early for the project and that the coming months should be illuminating.  “It’s so early. Nobody has seen this outside of the Libra, Calibra, and Facebook team before,” said van Ammers, adding:  “It takes time to get started with things like this.""

42382243,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r153,1561795213,Billions to Trillions: Crypto Assets and the Inevitability of Digitization,"Ami Ben David is founder and CEO of institutional digital securities blockchain Ownera, co-founder of SPiCE VC, previously co-founder of Securitize and investor in security token companies.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for the institutional market, with news and views delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.      Ten years after the invention of bitcoin, the general market is starting to realize – with a big push from Facebook – that digital money using blockchain technology is coming.  Behind the scenes, the next market is already kicking into gear as it becomes clear to all major players that not only is digitization of money on the way, but also digitization of ownership of assets, a significantly bigger financial market with massive global social and economic implications.  A few weeks ago, I co-hosted a closed workshop for London City institutional investors and bankers about digital securities. We split into round tables, and each table was tasked with rating the advantages of digitizing securities by importance: increased liquidity, efficiency, cost, post-trade streamlining, asset prices, fractional ownership, speed, global access, new financial products, business models etc.  When it was time to present the results, it became clear there was no consensus. Every table came up with different ordering, and within each table there was little agreement.  Following the event, I spoke to participants and realized that every person in the room was thinking about an asset class close to their own heart. Some were rating advantages for public stocks going digital, others were thinking about real estate debt, others thought of private equity.  In the big picture, the ranking doesn’t matter, because digitization is inevitable.  Securities will go digital because they can  Let’s explain, but first, here is a simplified account of what it means to digitize ownership:  Ownership is essentially data. Society agrees that owner X has rights in asset Y and protects these rights with the power of the courts and police. Like any data, ownership can be digitized.  Today, most global assets are private. To trade them, the seller and buyer go through a lengthy and expensive process, involving lawyers, accountants, etc., and then everyone signs documents which detail what rights the buyer gets. The combination of all documents across all owners is the ownership. Let’s call these documents “Analog Ownership.”  Public markets are more efficient – they have electronic records of ownership, but it is still not a digital item. Trades require multiple entities to settle each transaction across ledgers. Those public platforms are expensive and inefficient, with a very limited launch capacity.  Enter security tokens, for which a master set of documents and smart contracts define the rights of any token holder. A blockchain keeps a record of who owns each token, replicated in consensus, so no one entity controls the ledger.  You can then hold your tokens (yourself or with a custodian), or trade them (every transaction checked for regulation compliance, using AI).  Ownership essentially becomes a digital value which can be broken down into smaller parts that can flow instantly all over the world.  The main feature of digitization is not that securities are stored in 0s and 1s (that’s “electronic”), it’s that digitized securities can flow instantly on global networks.  What happens when a market transitions  Markets that go digital experience four stages. Let’s look at the music industry as an example:  Stage 1: Analog  Music is recorded on vinyl records. You can only buy the records your local shop gets.  The ownership equivalent: Most private transactions are local, require real-world contact.  Stage 2: Digital Format  Music is recorded on CDs. It’s now more portable, electronic, but not a fundamental change.  The ownership equivalent: Excel sheets, cap table management software…  Stage 3: Innovation!  Hackers discover they can send music files around – underground P2P platforms, illegal file sharing, music execs trying desperately to protect the old order, Napster, legal action…  The ownership equivalent: ICOs – just like music sharing 20 years earlier, it was developers who realized the potential of tokens to connect people directly and change the rules of the fund raising game, and also similarly, it only took authorities two years to fight back and enforce regulations.  Stage 4: Digital  At this final stage, music becomes truly digital and the market embraces the new format with legal and commercial solutions and new business models on a fast network. Applications like Spotify emerge, which allow every user in the world to listen to any song they want (they don’t have to buy a full record), whenever they want to.  Even better, algorithms and AI can create combinations and personalized discovery lists, new artists can get to market faster and cheaper, funded by new business models that 20 years ago would have been rejected by every single label executive.  The ownership version: Digital securities. Ownership can flow, like songs – think about a Spotify-like app that gives every user access to every single (relevant to them) asset in the global market.  When people ask, “Will investors want digital securities?,"" the answer is, “Do people still listen to songs?” Once all securities are digital and instantly available (within regulations), it’s all about the asset. The format is instant and transparent.  But with that, everything changes – availability, discovery, pricing and business models leading to a new flowing, digital world. Will it happen overnight?  Of course not, there are many hurdles to be overcome and solutions to be found, but the drivers are so powerful that digitization is effectively inevitable.  The difference between billions and trillions  Music is a market worth tens of billions of dollars; ownership in general encompasses hundreds of trillions of dollars.  In fact, “securities” is an umbrella name for dozens of asset classes, very different from one another. Each of them is typically bigger than the entire music market and targets completely different types of owners, investor pools and application flows. Some are retail-facing, many are mostly institutional with massive financial entities trading through investment banks and major exchanges.  However, at the bottom of all these asset classes, one truth remains: ownership is still data and is still about who has rights to what – that can now finally be digitized.
