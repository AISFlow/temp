Court documents indicated that 1Broker and founder Patrick Brunner would also be required to pay $26,000 in disgorgement fees. The CFTC did not immediately confirm the settlement.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are suing a Marshall Islands-based securities dealer for allegedly violating federal law through a bitcoin-based security swap scheme.  The SEC announced in a press release that it filed charges against 1pool Ltd., also known as 1Broker, as well as its CEO Patrick Brunner for selling security-based swaps to U.S. and international investors without following proper ""discretionary investment thresholds."" Notably, investors could only purchase these swaps with bitcoin, according to the claims.  The SEC is further claiming that 1Broker was not registered a ""security-based swaps dealer"" and ""failed to transact its security-based swaps on a registered national exchange.""  It added:  ""The SEC alleges that a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, acting in an undercover capacity, successfully purchased several security-based swaps on 1Broker's platform from the U.S. despite not meeting the discretionary investment thresholds required by the federal securities laws.""  Shamoil Shipchandler, director of the SEC's Fort Worth regional office, said in a statement that ""the SEC protects U.S. investors across a variety of platforms, regardless of the type of currency used in their transactions ... International companies that transact with U.S. investors cannot circumvent compliance with the federal securities laws by using cryptocurrency.""  The regulator is looking for a permanent injunction against Brunner and 1pool, along with penalties and ""disgorgement plus interest.""  In addition, the CFTC filed charges against 1Broker for similarly violating federal laws by failing to implement anti-money laundering and supervisory features.  The FBI later reported it had seized the 1broker.com domain, claiming the company has violated money laundering and wire fraud laws, in addition to ""operating as an unregistered broker/dealer of securities"" and ""operating as an unregistered futures commission merchant.""  1Broker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dell EMC, a subsidiary to the computer manufacturer Dell, announced on Wednesday that it has plans to invest in emerging technologies including artificial intelligence, blockchain, data analytics and cloud-compliance, the Economic Times reported.  In particular, the firm hopes to maintain its position in the server market by adopting new tools.  Manish Gupta, a senior director of the Infrastructure Solutions Group at Dell EMC India, said the interest from the company's top clients in blockchain led them to adopt the technology. Dell EMC is looking to new technologies to help the clients manage both traditional and ""new age"" workloads on Dell servers.  Dell EMC clients consist mainly of local IT firms, banks, financial and investment companies, according to the report.  Supplementing the need to keep up with their clients, the Indian Express reported that a study by Dell Technologies Digital Transformation Index, showed that 37 percent of Indian businesses plan to invest in blockchain, 31 percent in quantum computing and 42 percent in augmented reality or virtual reality technologies over the next few years.  Dell EMC COO Dmitri Chen indicated that the company is therefore hoping to piggyback on the growing interest, noting that India is increasingly moving toward digitization.  Moreover, he added:  ""India is shifting towards ... transformation faster than the rest of the world because of the country's digital agenda and the presence of a highly skilled tech savvy workforce. Hence, we're spending a lot more time thinking, talking about India and spending time in the country.""  Notably, Dell EMC is not the only Dell subsidiary looking into blockchain technologies.

42401928,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2yrw,1538074805,Crypto Money Market Compound Lets You HODL and Earn,"Wouldn't it be nice to earn interest on your crypto holdings?  Especially in a down market, those hodling crypto would love that. And ethereum-based startup Compound is launching a product to do just that.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Compound's platform for allowing crypto enthusiasts to make their holdings available for short-term loans, in turn, earning interest on those loans in crypto, launched on the ethereum blockchain today.  Compound is creating what the traditional financial world refers to as a money market – a fund that provides short-term loans at a flat, publicly stated rate. Investors put funds into a pool, loans get made against it and when the investor wants to withdraw, they get a share of the profit proportionate to their investment.  These financial instruments are typically for high liquidity loans with short (even as short as a day) time horizons. Plus, with publicly posted rates, both lenders and borrowers can know exactly what the interest will be without negotiation.  In this case, Compound is offering a smart contract-enabled money market for lending in five different coins: ether, Trust Token's trueUSD, 0x's ZRX, Brave's BAT and Augur's REP.  Each asset will have a publicly stated interest rate for supplying and borrowing, set algorithmically based on demand for each asset. Rates will be the same for all users.  In this way, Compound is giving holders a way to hedge against a weak market, and it should help big players cover the costs incurred from holding, such as custodial or security expenses.  And Compound has already seen a fair amount of interest.  The software was built with $8.2 million in venture funding, led by notable investors Bain Capital Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain.  In an email to CoinDesk, Polychain CEO Olaf Carlson-Wee, said:  ""We believe that Compound is building one of the core crypto-financial primitives for the financial system of Web3. This project fits well with our thesis that decentralized finance will be one of the first key use-cases of Web3.""  In addition, more than 26 institutional partners have committed a minimum of $100,000 in crypto to the market, so there should be at least $2.6 million in crypto ready for lending at launch.  While returns on money in the market are likely to be small, every percentage point gain can make a difference for large institutional funds sitting on massive crypto holdings right now.  As such, while the software is built so that anyone with crypto holdings can supply capital to the money market, Compound founder Robert Leshner said, ""In general, I think the majority of our users will be institutional.""  Long or short?  Leshner sees three initial use cases for Compound, primarily driven by financial markets.  First, for traders that want to leverage a long position in a token, they can borrow from Compound and buy more of the token they want to place a bet on.  The ability to take on very short-term loans can be helpful if a trader wants to make a bet on a specific event in the near future. It gives traders a way to know the price of a risk they are taking in a straightforward way.  It's important to note here that a trader can use Compound to borrow for a position in almost any currency, as long as it can be easily traded into one of the five currencies Compound holds. So, for example, if a user wanted to make a bet on a price movement in OmiseGo's OMG, he or she could borrow ETH, trade it for OMG and wait.  This is an important point for the second major use case: shorting, a way of making money on an asset when its price does down.  As a simple example: one user can agree to borrow one ETH from another user, with an agreement to pay them 3 percent annually on the price of the ETH when it was borrowed till they return it. Let's say ETH was $300 at the time. So the first user borrows the ETH and immediately sells it. Then they have $300 in the bank.  Four months later, say ETH drops to $250. The borrower then buys one ETH with their banked money and returns it to the person it was borrowed from, with a payment of $3 to cover four month's interest. The borrower pockets $47 in profit.  It might look like the lender lost out, but it's good for both sides. Imagine the person who lent the ETH is someone deeply invested in the ethereum ecosystem – one who has no intention of exiting their long-term position – so they are now $3 richer and they still have just as much ETH.  This ability to more easily short crypto was a key consideration for one of Compound's main investors.  ""There are already (centralized) solutions to borrow ETH and other crypto to short it,"" Salil Deshpande of Bain Capital Ventures told CoinDesk in an email. ""We invested in Compound because it is a proper – decentralized – money market for crypto.""  Deshpande argued that with more liquid markets to make short positions, overvalued cryptocurrencies will be forced to correct their prices in the market.  Intended purpose  The last use case – borrowing tokens to use them for their actual application – may be further out.  Leshner used Brave's BAT as his example. One day, Brave plans to launch a consent-based advertising model whereby agencies have to use the cryptocurrency to buy ad space. Rather than buying BAT outright, the agencies might prefer to borrow some BAT, thereby hedging against the possibility of prices going down.  This could be especially important in a world where most of that crypto lending is happening on exchanges.  That lending, as the Compound whitepaper points out, is typically virtual; borrowers don't really hold those tokens, making it impossible to use them on the decentralized applications (dapps) they were intended for.  Because the only counterparty is the smart contract itself, the money market is willing to take any business at its stated rate.  Users don't have to look for someone with the opposite position to theirs in an order book; they can just accept Compound's rates and take the short-term loan. And this also saves those supplying the capital the effort of managing the loans they make.  Speaking to how Compound differentiates, Leshner said:  ""This is not a person-to-person marketplace like almost everyone is building.""  Compound's role  Compound's business model is straightforward.  ""We keep a small residual of all interest that moves through the system,"" Leshner explained. ""The more assets inside the system the more we earn.""  And currently, as the white paper states, Compound will have centralized control of the protocol, which will allow them to, for instance, choose the software model that sets interest rates for each asset.  For Bain Capital's Deshpande, these interest rates are integral to making sure people continue holding crypto.  ""Without interest rates like Compound provides, crypto assets have a nominal and a real negative yield,"" he said, adding:  ""The costs of storage and security (both on and off exchange) and the inflation of the token supply – this is a disincentive to hold crypto assets.""  In this, Compound aims for its interest rates to provide a standard to judge other crypto investments by. Because the loans on Compound are collateralized, they are nearly risk free, so it establishes a floor for what each token should earn when it's put towork.  And having this unified, floating rate across any given asset provides an additional benefit to those supplying capital – lenders don't need to wait for loans to close to withdraw; they can take their funds out at any time.  ""Everybody shares the same terms. This should be a neutral, open source, transparent infrastructure,"" Leshner said.  Yet, over time, the protocol will be transitioned into a more decentralized one, where community members and other stakeholders determine the path forward.  Until then, though, Compound is looking for more tokens to offer loans in, although, they have to have adequate liquidity and market confidence.  ""We're looking for well known, highly liquid, larger market cap tokens to be listed,"" Leshner concluded.

House Resolution 5036  , a bill hoping to establish the ""Independent Financial Technology Task Force to Combat Terrorism and Illicit Financing,"" was referred to the House of Representatives Wednesday for consideration. The bill, a seeming upgrade from one introduced by Representative Ted Budd earlier this year, would launch a working group to examine cryptocurrencies and other new forms of financial technologies, in particular looking for any potential use in crimes.  Public records  indicate that the bill was passed by the House with a ""motion to reconsider laid on the table"" being ""agreed to without objection."" A spokesperson for Budd's office told CoinDesk this means the bill will now proceed to the Senate.  Like an earlier form of the bill, H.R. 5036 would have brought together federal law enforcement leaders and provide them a year to study cryptocurrencies and how they may be used in funding terrorist activities.  The task force would then have been required to brief Congress, including by proposing actions to curb such activity in the future.  The bill also provided rewards for individuals or entities who provide information leading to convictions for malicious actors using cryptocurrencies to fund terrorist activities.  However, unlike previous versions of the bill, 5036 specifically added provisions for preventing ""rogue and foreign actors from evading sanctions,"" explaining that:  ""The President [of the U.S.], acting through [the task force], shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report that identifies and describes the potential uses of digital currencies and other related emerging technologies by states, non-state actors, and foreign terrorist organizations to evade sanctions, finance terrorism, or launder monetary instruments, and threaten United States national security.""

Citing use cases across industries including manufacturing, retail and healthcare, the conglomerate said its clients ""will have better resources to track and manage information across multiple parties"" using the ""highly secure"" permissioned blockchain platform.  The blockchain-as-a-service platform has been designed to slot in with other notable blockchain platforms too, including IBM Blockchain and Microsoft Azure, and AT&T's internet of things tools can also be tied in to enable automation and monitoring capabilities.  The release touts the strengths of the new platform in tracking the provenance and movement of goods for manufacturers, in allowing healthcare providers to share patient data while maintaining privacy and helping retailers manage stock and track deliveries  Saying the nascent tech is ""transforming the way many companies conduct business,"" Andy Daudelin, vice president, Alliances Business Development, AT&T Business, commented in the release:  ""Blockchain improves security and enables better management of transactions through complex processes. Utilizing our global network and IoT capabilities, AT&T enhances blockchain by providing edge-to-edge solutions that automate the tracking and that can even monitor the environmental conditions throughout the process.""

The Federal Government's Finance Agency (OeBFA) has assigned banking giant Oesterreichische Kontrollbank (OeKB) to carry out the auction on its behalf on Oct. 2, according to a finance ministry announcement Tuesday.  The bank's responsibilities will include deploying the notarization service to authenticate auction transaction data and subsequently store it on the blockchain, the agency explained.  A news report from Kleine Zeitung on Tuesday indicated that OeKB has confirmed that it will use internal IT resources to oversee the deployment, which will utilize the ethereum blockchain to store the data as hash values on the public network.  Angelika Sommer-Hemetsberger, member of the management board of OeKB, commented in the announcement:  ""Blockchain technology offers great potential for increasing efficiency and ensuring the quality of bank processes. Therefore, we have been dealing with this topic intensively for some time now and have already tested several prototypes. Starting the real operation on behalf of OeBFA is a pleasing and logical next step.""  This is the Austrian government's first move to adopt blockchain for domestic financial transactions, the OeBFA said, adding that it views the emerging technology as an ""economic policy focus.""  ""This added security contributes to a high level of confidence in the auction process of Austrian government bonds and strengthens Austria's good standing in the market, which can also indirectly contribute to favorable financing costs,"" said Markus Stix, head of the OeBFA.

42401935,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2yyp,1538053218,How I Lost My Faith in Private Blockchains,"Angus Champion de Crespigny is an advisor to various companies and projects on bitcoin, cryptocurrency and identity infrastructure. He spent 11 years at EY, with the last four consulting on blockchain and crypto assets until his departure in August.      Since 2015, while there has been a myriad of permissioned blockchain announcements from enterprises, questions have been raised as to the long-term viability of these projects. A common theme in the small number of projects that have gone live is a disconnect between an understanding of traditional industry and the technical understanding required has made the value difficult to define.  While there is most certainly a disconnect between business processes and the technology, rather than limiting the development of business cases, I believe it has in fact led to the opposite problem: unjustified beliefs and hype of what the technology can do. I also believe it remains to be proven if permissioned blockchains provide a real business benefit at all.  The reason I question whether there is a benefit is that I spent four years working with financial institutions who were trying to find it.  While in the first couple of years I was optimistic of their potential, as more and more use cases were objectively evaluated and failed against other technology, I objectively assessed the technology against alternatives and reevaluated my assumptions. What this led to is a shift to advising clients to leverage technology better suited to their problems, and a greater a focus on public blockchains and crypto assets.  The challenges I found in applying permissioned blockchains in industry came down to the following: definition, differentiation, process impact, and necessity.  Definition  The difficulty in describing the challenges with permissioned blockchains begins with the difficulty of defining what it is.  At its most basic level, a blockchain could be defined as a data structure, or simply a chain of blocks. However, this definition is rarely what people mean when they talk about blockchains.  Typically, discussions around blockchains talk about consensus and reconciliations, due to the original permissioned blockchains that were forks of bitcoin or ethereum being used in a private manner. As time went on, different consensus algorithms were introduced, as well as different ways to store data that no longer used blocks to share data globally, such as R3's Corda. Consequently, the term ""distributed ledger technology"" emerged, which people would put in the same bucket as blockchains.  Every few months, a government agency somewhere around the world tries to define blockchain or distributed ledger technology for regulatory reasons. A common theme, however, is they rarely define it in a way that differs from a distributed database or even more simply, Google Docs. And if it can't be differentiated in the definition, then it shouldn't be considered different at all.  So, to be as specific as we can, in this article I will be discussing technology that shares data with other parties in a way specifically designed to prevent central control. If you have the ability to centrally control, you have a database, and it should be assessed and compared as such.  No doubt there will still be nuances that this definition misses, but that is part of the problem of the industry: large claims of potential benefits are made, without defining the tool. And if we don't define the tool, how can we say that it's right or wrong?  Differentiation  Going with the above definition, a blockchain is typically touted as a beneficial system due to its ability to store and communicate data, with redundancy and protection from loss. The data is automatically reconciled across a large number of parties, allowing virtually instant data transfer and tracking. The data can never be changed and the data is fully transparent to prevent fraud.  Alternatively, if needed, you can encrypt the data so none of the other parties can see it. Finally, it allows you to run complex programs, perhaps even resembling legal agreements, that all parties can see and gain comfort that they will execute in a particular way.  The interesting thing here is that everything that has just been described is all achievable with a distributed database: technology that is widely used in industry, and was around for many years before bitcoin was released.  There is, however, one key difference between the two technologies that we've included in our definition: blockchains are specifically designed to prevent central governance.  This feature doesn't come for free, however.  In a blockchain, every node stores all data. Every node runs every program, and every transaction is sent to everyone across the network. To make changes to a blockchain, new blockchain software would need to be created and distributed to all participants who would need to install over their current version. Each of these requirements adds a non-trivial technology and governance cost to the deployment and ongoing operation of the blockchain.  By comparison, to make changes to a database, the administrator makes the changes in the master and they instantly propagate across all nodes. Computation, also, is optimized. In a distributed database where all participants can have a copy of this data and any applications running, they would be able to monitor and review for any unauthorized changes or updates.  It may, therefore, be easiest to think of a blockchain as a distributed database with the ability to administer it taken away.  The key question to ask then, is what are the reasons an enterprise would prefer to sacrifice many measurable metrics – transactions per second, disk space, speed and efficiency of computation, cost of maintenance – and opt instead for deploying a technology that is harder to administer?  Process impact  At this point, the argument that is typically used is that the removal of central governance is beneficial when doing business with entities who you do not trust. I am skeptical of this argument.  Businesses conduct transactions with other entities all the time, and they establish contracts for these purposes. A blockchain is not going to remove the need for a contract, and there's been little evidence to suggest that such contracts can be encoded with all the nuances required of the law.  Another argument raised is that decentralizing the ownership can allow a shared capturing of value. A recent tweetstorm by Alex Rampell, Partner at Andreesen Horowitz, expressed this sentiment, where he hypothesized that the banks would not have lost the upside of the Visa business and fallen behind had they deployed it as a decentralized ledger.  Why could the same upside not have been captured by the banks by simply maintaining stock in the spun-off business, and allowing the business to grow in the most efficient way possible? A distributed ledger hypothetically may have allowed the banks to maintain a hold on Visa, but I believe it's worth taking note of the other side of this coin: the technology would have restricted it from being the most technically efficient business it could be.  A somewhat different view I have heard is that blockchain technology is the future, and therefore while we cannot quantify the benefits, it is worthwhile moving to the new paradigm to stay ahead of the curve.  Putting aside the obvious risks of attempting to predict the future, the trouble with this logic is that it assumes that ""blockchain"" is one big nebulous technology, and that moving to a blockchain is the key component, rather than what that future actually looks like and adjusting your product to fit that future.  Without knowing the shape of that future, it is a significant technology investment and sacrifice onto a closed network that may or may not pay off.  Is this really necessary?  Let's say the decision is made to go ahead with a permissioned blockchain project. To implement the technology, the entities need to define the rules of the blockchain. To do this, a project typically progresses as follows:  Decide to develop a blockchain application  Establish a consortium of interested parties to centralize investment and coordinate decision making  A trusted central party has now been created to govern the development of the blockchain.  When stage three is reached, there is now a trusted central party that will define the rules of the blockchain and define how updates are made and distributed, and all interested parties will accept the outputs of that trusted party.  If all entities trust a central party to define standards and distribute updates, what is the benefit of a blockchain over a distributed database managed by the trusted central party? The members of the consortium have a legal relationship with the trusted central party and are accepting any necessary maintenance by default: why not use a far more efficient data management system?  This comes back to one of the key value propositions that people are sold on: that this technology can help multiple parties coordinate on a problem with many data points. Where this falls down, however, is that coordination is a human problem, not a technology problem.  By the time coordination with all involved parties has taken place, the major problem is typically already solved. Consequently, additional technology is not needed, and certainly not technology that's incredibly costly in its enforcement of that goal.  You can't force decentralization  What much of this comes down to, is the fact that you can never be half decentralized: any level of centralization will end up with the system coalescing around that central point of management.  The business and legal worlds operate from an aspect of centralized entities, and while that remains the case, any forced attempts at decentralization are likely to come short. While it is possible that in the future we may see decentralized businesses, they are far more likely to come from the public blockchain world where they are able to grow organically in an entirely new paradigm.  In the meantime, institutions and individuals should be evaluating permissioned blockchains like any other technology: it isn't magic, and it should be assessed like one would assess any other. The benefits of a technology should never be assumed based on buzzwords, hype or fear that ""everyone else is doing it so why shouldn't I?""  Instead, benefits should be assessed by asking what is the business problem, what are the different technology options available, and what are the quantifiable costs and benefits of each. There is no reason why an institution should change its technology selection approach for the sole purpose of blockchain projects: they need to be discerning and choose the technology that can demonstrably solve the problem for the lowest cost.  To date, I have not seen such an analysis undertaken.  Smart businesses will evaluate whether their problem can be solved and at lower cost on a database or a public blockchain, and press those selling the technology for a demonstrable burden of proof.

42401922,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2yn1,1538049677,"US Judge Sides With CFTC in Fraud Case, Ruling Cryptos Are Commodities","A U.S. judge has sided with the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in a lawsuit involving an allegedly fraudulent crypto investment scheme, ruling that the cryptocurrencies involved are commodities for the purpose of the case.  As CoinDesk reported at the time, the CFTC charged two individuals and a Las Vegas-based business called My Big Coin Pay over the alleged cryptocurrency-related scam back in January.  The commission accused the pair, Randall Crater and Mark Gillespie, as well as the firm, of taking customer funds and siphoning that money into their personal accounts. Additionally, they allegedly used those funds ""for personal expenses and the purchase of luxury goods.""  Subsequently, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that the cryptos involved are not commodities and, as such, the CFTC has no jurisdiction over the case.  However, Judge Rya W. Zobel from the district court of Massachusetts has now agreed with the counterarguments made by the CFTC and denied the motion to dismiss on Wednesday. As a result, the case will continue.      The defendants contended that My Big Coin – which Crater and Gillespie marketed as a cryptocurrency that can be mined and traded – did not deal with any ""contracts for future delivery."" Therefore, it's not a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), the two argued.  However, the CFTC refuted that contention, stating:              ""A 'commodity' for purposes of [the CEA definition] is broader than any particular type or brand of that commodity.""  ""Pointing to the existence of bitcoin futures contracts, [the CFTC] argues that contracts for future delivery of virtual currencies are 'dealt in' and that My Big Coin, as a virtual currency, is therefore a commodity,"" the CFTC continued.  ""The text of the statute supports plaintiff's argument. The Act defines 'commodity' generally and categorically, 'not by type, grade, quality, brand, producer, manufacturer, or form,'"" the Judge wrote.  The decision is the latest instance in which cryptocurrencies involved in an alleged fraud lawsuit have been determined by a U.S. judge to be commodities that are subject to the jurisdiction of the CFTC.  CoinDesk reported in March that another U.S district judge also backed the financial watchdog and made a similar decision in a fraud lawsuit concerning a firm called CabbageTech.  The court later ruled in favor of the regulators, finding that CabbageTech and its proprietor, Patrick McDonnell, had been running a fraudulent operation and imposing a $1 million fine in penalties and restitution, Bloomberg reported.

42401943,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2z5i,1538046408,$6.3K: Bitcoin Sell-Off Could Resume Should Key Support Break,"Bitcoin (BTC) is currently still being squeezed into a tightening range, with support at $6,300 being a key level for the bulls to defend, technical charts indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency carved out a temporary bottom around $6,100 earlier this month and crossed resistance at $6,600 last Friday, confirming a double bottom bullish reversal.  However, the ensuing rally ran out of steam at highs above $6,800. More importantly, prices have fallen back below $6,600 this week, invalidating the bullish setup.  While the price action witnessed in the last seven days is demoralizing for the bulls, only a move below $7,400 – support of the trendline connecting the Sept. 8 low and Sept. 18 low – would confirm a bearish revival.  As of writing, BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day at $6,480 on Bitfinex.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, BTC has charted a bear flag – a bearish continuation pattern – which indicates the sell-off from the monthly high of $7,429 would resume if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below the flag support (support of trendline from Sept. 78 lows) of $6,400.  A bear flag breakdown, if confirmed, would open the doors to $5,400 (target as per the measured move method). Moreover, it would also validate the bearish view put forward by the negative crossover between the 5-month and 10-month exponential moving averages (MAs).  Still, the bears would need to observe caution as the area around $6,000, which has acted as a strong support in the recent past, may put the brakes on the sell-off.  Hourly chart  Over on the hourly chart, BTC is already on the defensive, having breached the rising channel to the downside. Further, the 100-hour moving average (MA) has just crossed the 200-hour MA, confirming the path of least resistance is to the downside.  As a result, the odds of BTC falling below the crucial support of $6,300 in the next 24 hours are high.  View  BTC could be in for a bigger drop toward the June low of $5,755 if the flag support of $6,300 is breached.  On the way lower, BTC may encounter strong support around $6,000. A solid rebound from that level would neutralize the bearish setup.  On the higher side, a convincing move above $6,588 (previous day's high) would weaken the bearish case put forward by the hourly chart.

Veem offers a multi-rail payments platform – including both traditional SWIFT-based transfers and blockchain networks – aimed to provide speed, security and low fees by selecting the most advantageous route for a particular transfer, it said in a press release.  Its mission, Veem says, is to address the issue of small business owners being ""forced to deal with a slow, outdated, and expensive wire transfer system to send and receive international payments.""  The release continues:  ""SWIFT, a 40-year-old technology, consistently slaps small businesses with fees, loses payments, and lacks the transparency necessary to ensure reliability and security.""  Veem also offers some detail on its customer growth in the release, saying the user base has grown ""exponentially"" from 590 customers at the time of its Series A funding round in 2015. By the Series B stage that had increased to 18,000, and is now ""over 80,000 small businesses in 96 countries,"" the startup claims.  ""We're thrilled to have Goldman Sachs lead our investment round. This funding will help us expand our footprint, increase our distribution and form new strategic partnerships,"" Veem CEO and founder Marwan Forzley said.

China Securities Times, the mouthpiece of Chinese financial regulators, reported on Thursday that the banking giant issued a total of 9.3 billion yuan (or around $1.3 billion) worth of RMBSs via its proprietary blockchain network, Jucai Chain.  According to a document dated Sept. 27 that outlines details of the issuance, the Bank of Communications was the main issuer with China International Capital Corporation as lead underwriter and book runner for the offering. Other co-underwriters included the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Merchants Bank.  By moving the credit data of the mortgages onto a distributed network, different parties along the issuance process are able to view the most up-to-date information and conduct due diligence and settle transactions in a peer-to-peer fashion, the report said.  A residential mortgage-backed security is typically made of a pool of mortgage loans owned by financial institutions, which group these loans into tranches depending on their risks and returns, and then sell to other investors.  According to a report from Xinhua last month, the Bank of Communications first rolled out the Jucai Chain blockchain platform in June, specifically for asset-backed securities, in an effort to speed up the issuance process. After the initial launch, the bank started moving mortgage data of the securities batch onto the blockchain in July, the news source said.  Other commercial banks in China have also recently announced various asset-backed security issuances via distributed networks.  For instance, the Agricultural Bank of China, another state-owned institution, offered a loan worth $300,000 using a blockchain system in the country's Guizhou province in July.  And, in August, a privately held commercial bank in Zhejiang also settled blockchain-based transactions for a security offering based on corporate account receivables worth $66 million.

With the investment, SEBA said it will develop and offer traditional banking services to firms in the crypto industry and to also provide cryptocurrency trading, asset management and custody services for institutions that are interested in moving to the nascent space.  SEBA is now applying for a banking and securities dealer license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) before it can roll out the planned crypto banking services.  According to a report from Reuters, the FINMA has confirmed that the licensing process is underway. If granted, SEBA said it will eventually open both online and physical banks for crypto and traditional financial services.  Andreas Amschwand, former global head of foreign exchange and money market at UBS and now chairman of SEBA, commented in the announcement:  ""In Switzerland, we have the commitment from various authorities to establish a comprehensive regulatory environment for the development of blockchain technology and the sustainable, stable growth of crypto assets.

42394018,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsapLz,1538021061,Bitmain By the Numbers: An Inside Look at a Bitcoin Mining Empire,"That Bitmain is a behemoth is hardly news.  CoinDesk had previously reported that the cryptocurrency mining hardware maker brought in revenues of $2.5 billion in 2017 and $2 billion in Q1 2018, but with the publication on Wednesday of Bitmain's draft initial public offering (IPO) prospectus – a step towards its much-anticipated listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the firms' sheer size and blistering growth can now be parsed in significantly greater detail.  Read More: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  The 438-page prospectus includes detailed information about Bitmain's sales and profitability going back to 2015, as well as a breakdown of its revenues it takes in from different lines of business.  The prospectus also includes a picture of Bitmain's costs – which are particularly notable, given that they illustrate how much the company is investing in growth and how unpredictable returns on that investment can be due to volatile cryptocurrency prices.  Revenues and profits  Bitmain's dominance of the global market for cryptocurrency mining equipment is common knowledge (its market share is 75 percent, according to the prospectus), and its financial statements show just how lucrative it is to be in that position.  From just $137.3 million in 2015, Bitmain's sales logged a blistering 328 percent compound annual growth rate to reach $2.5 billion in 2017. At $2.8 billion, this year's revenues had already surpassed last year's total by the end of June, according to the document.  Profits have also shot up in a few short years, from $48.6 million in 2015 to $952.6 million in 2017 – a 280 percent compound annual growth rate. While profits for the first half of 2018 have not quite surpassed the total for the whole of last year, they are close, at $952.2 million.  For comparison, Nvidia, a chip manufacturer that enjoyed a windfall when crypto miners began to adopt its graphics processing unit (GPU) chips, but which long predates the invention of cryptocurrency, earned $3 billion on $9.7 billion in revenues in 2017.  Intel, the semiconductor giant, earned $9.6 billion on $62.8 billion in revenues.  Revenue breakdown  The recently published prospectus also provides a detailed view of the sources of Bitmain's revenues.  The breakdown makes it clear that the bulk of Bitmain's sales have consistently come from selling mining hardware, specifically the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that have displaced GPUs in a number of markets (in many cases, because Bitmain introduced the ASICs).  Notably, however, mining hardware sales have grown as a share of total revenue, from 79 percent in 2015 to 94 percent in the first half of 2018.  The revenues contributed by other lines of business – most importantly, proprietary mining – have shrunk as a proportion of Bitmain's total sales. In absolute terms, however, revenues from every source grew from 2015 to 2017 and appear set to grow again by the end of 2018.  This breakdown could potentially raise questions about shrinking revenue diversification at Bitmain, as the company depends more and more on selling mining hardware. On the other hand, this monolithic category (""mining hardware"") hides Bitmain's recent expansion into new sorts of mining hardware, which decreases its reliance on the market for bitcoin and bitcoin cash ASICs.  ""We have focused on developing mining hardware with different algorithms covering major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Litecoin, Dash and Zcash,"" the prospectus says, ""which makes us one of the few companies offering mining solutions for various cryptocurrencies.""  Costs and investments  Crunching Bitmain's revenue and profit numbers, something stands out: profit growth has lagged behind revenue growth by a noticeable margin, meaning that the company is either re-investing money in the business, or facing higher costs.  It turns out, the answer is a bit of both. The largest increase in spending came from materials and manufacturing costs, which the company notes in its prospectus: ""represent our payment to our production partners for the fabrication and the packaging and testing of our ASIC chips.""  The steep rise in these costs – from just $93.7 million in 2017 to $1.5 billion in the first half of 2018 – signal that Bitmain is ramping up production fast.  The increase in manufacturing and materials costs, the firm notes, ""is in line with our business growth.""  The picture is not entirely rosy, however.  The company took two big hits of around a quarter-billion dollars each in 2017 and 2018, which it describes as ""provisions for impairment of inventories and prepayment to suppliers.""  The document explains that these costs are ultimately due to the unpredictability of cryptocurrency prices: ""the fluctuation of certain cryptocurrencies caused the anticipated selling price of certain mining hardware below their cost.""  Crypto and other assets  Bitmain is vulnerable to cryptocurrency market turns on more than one front.  While it does mine on its own behalf and takes a share of mining pool rewards, those lines of business accounted for a fraction of revenues in the first half of 2018. Most of Bitmain's (considerable) cryptocurrency holdings, the prospectus notes, come from sales of hardware settled in crypto.  At the end of June, Bitmain held $886.9 million worth of bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin, dash and other crypto assets – more than twice what it held in fiat currency.  At 28 percent of total assets, Bitmain's crypto holdings made up a slightly smaller share in June than at the end of 2017 (30 percent). However, given the broad decline in crypto assets' value in dollar terms, back-of-the-envelope math suggests that Bitmain's crypto holdings grew considerably, in terms of the number of tokens.
