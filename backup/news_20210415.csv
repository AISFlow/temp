According to a blog posthttps://filecoin.io/blog/posts/ipfsunion-announces-1.3-billion-investment-in-filecoin-mining-facility/ on Tuesday, distributed storage service provider IPFS Union's funding is part of a grand vision of building the ""Big Data Industrial Park"" based in the Jiangxi Province of Fuzhou City.    Upon its completion, the facility will be the largest filecoin distributed storage infrastructure project in China – a major development for a network that only recently pivoted to a mainnet.

42406235,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesuy2,1618530288,SushiSwap Makes $50K Crypto Donation to No Kid Hungry,"The core developers of SushiSwap, an automated market-making decentralized cryptocurrency exchange on the Ethereum blockchain, donated 25 ETH (worth approximately $50,000 at the time) to No Kid Hungry, the charity announced on Wednesday.      The Giving Block, a platform that enables nonprofit organizations to accept cryptocurrency donations, handled the transfer. Donors have more than 200 recipient organizations to choose from through the platform, which also offers information and a guide on the tax benefits of crypto donations.      “SushiSwap’s donation was incredibly generous, and we’re excited to see teams building in crypto donate to awesome causes like No Kid Hungry,” Alex Wilson, co-founder of The Giving Block, told CoinDesk.      “Every major donation like this encourages more nonprofits to accept cryptocurrency donations, pushing adoption further in the nonprofit industry. No Kid Hungry was one of our earliest clients, and they've helped us grow from working with 10 nonprofits to now working with over 200,” Wilson added.      The SushiSwap exchange has proven one of the biggest success stories in the recent explosion of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. The price of its governance token, SUSHI, skyrocketed to all-time highs above $20 in March, representing a 30-fold gain from its November 2020 low. (Its price was about $18 on Thursday.)    Read more: DeFi Protocol SushiSwap’s SUSHI Token Hits Record High, Eyes Further Gains    In December, No Kid Hungry was one of more than 120 organizations, including Save the Children and The Tor Project, that took part in #BitcoinTuesday, the crypto edition of the annual charity event #GivingTuesday, spearheaded by The Giving Block.      According to a March report on No Kid Hungry’s coronavirus response from Executive Chair Billy Shore and President and CEO Tom Nelson, since the beginning of the pandemic last year the organization has provided more than $66 million in grants to 1,800 schools, nonprofits and food banks in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and Guam and has served nearly 1 billion meals nationwide.      ""It’s been a year now since the pandemic began and the crypto community’s support of No Kid Hungry has helped millions of kids struggling to get the food they need to learn and thrive. It’s been so inspiring to see the truly heartfelt support from crypto donors, all of whom made their gifts to No Kid Hungry through The Giving Block,"" said Diane Clifford, managing director, Constituent Development and Operations of No Kid Hungry.      She noted that the SushiSwap core developers' donation ""will provide up to 500,000 meals for kids across America.""    Tax deductions, bull runs and crypto donations    No Kid Hungry is among the growing number of nonprofits that have begun to accept crypto donations, including highlighting crypto’s favorable tax treatment under Internal Revenue Service regulations. The IRS treats cryptocurrency donations to 501(c)s or other tax-exempt nonprofits as tax deductible, like stocks and other property, and not subject to capital gains tax.    Read more: Hodlers Can Donate Crypto to Charity to Minimize Tax Payments    And with increased attention on the crypto space around Coinbase’s direct listing on Wednesday, Wilson sees continued growth in crypto donations to nonprofits.      “As the price of crypto continues to increase, so do the potential capital gains tax liabilities. We’re seeing donors use our platform and the causes we work with as a way to do good while also offsetting their capital gains taxes when they take profit on a position,” Wilson said. “Overall, we’re seeing millions of dollars being donated to the causes we work with and don’t expect it to slow down any time soon.”      No Kid Hungry currently accepts donations in bitcoin, ether, basic attention token, bitcoin cash, chainlink, dai, litecoin, zcash (ZEC) and others, according to The Giving Block.",POSITIVE,없음,BAT | BCH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Cameron Hood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/15/sushiswap-makes-50k-crypto-donation-to-no-kid-hungry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d64252457cc7b170a3bd222a26d4c208de6bd18c-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As of April 14, the total market capitalization of tether (USDT) on Tron was $24 billion, versus $23.4 billion on Ethereum.  ""As the popularity and adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain continue to grow, we expect USDT to continue to explode in popularity” Justin Sun, founder of Tron and CEO of BitTorrent, said in a press release. “By crossing this historic milestone, I can proudly say that Tron is well positioned to become the global settlement layer and the blockchain protocol of the future.”  The growth of the tether on Tron came as transaction fees on Ethereum remain high, frustrating many crypto traders who frequently use the stablecoin during trading to exit quickly from short-term trades and lock in gains with an asset at a stabilized value.  As CoinDesk reported previously, the number of tether transactions on the Tron blockchain have also passed those on Ethereum.  According to data from CoinGecko, tether is the most traded cryptocurrency in the world, exceeding bitcoin, ether and meme crypto dogecoin.

42389647,6HUmrVESdCCDHrrhgaSWHN,1618515822,"Guess Who Might Be Buying $BTC? Grayscale, the Power Behind $GBTC","Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital asset manager, has taken an equity stake in exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer ClearShares – just as the issuer converted one of its ETF ticker symbols, from PIFI to BTC.  The move comes a little over a week after Grayscale confirmed that it was committed to converting its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), to an ETF. Among competition from other closed-end funds and bitcoin ETFs in Canada, GBTC has been trading at a discount for more than a month. Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.  ""Grayscale has taken an ownership stake in ClearShares as part of its long-term commitment to bring digital currency ETFs to market, with the potential to collaborate on products with investment strategies related to the digital currency industry,” a Grayscale spokeswoman said.  Bitcoin ETFs have seen renewed interest in 2020 and 2021 as vehicles that would allow retail and institutional investors exposure to the asset class when they don’t want to touch bitcoin itself. In the past, the SEC has rejected every bitcoin ETF application, but incoming SEC Chair Gary Gensler could change the regulator’s attitude to the novel investment product. Gensler is a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman who has taught crypto and blockchain courses at MIT in recent years.  ClearShares is a small ETF issuer that hasn’t done anything in the cryptocurrency or digital asset space, said James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The fund formerly known as PIFI only had $32 million assets under management and “hasn’t done all that well performance-wise,” he added.  Converting ETFs to a different strategy is common among issuers, Seyffart said. One such example was when ETF Managers Group converted a Latin American Real Estate (LARE) ETF to a marijuana ETF with the ticker symbol MJX (later MJ).  It’s unclear whether Grayscale bought a minority or majority stake in ClearShares. CoinDesk reached out to ClearShares to clarify the terms of the deal, but an external spokesman who works with Grayscale responded instead, saying Grayscale would not comment on the terms.  While Grayscale has been hiring ETF specialists, it's possible the investment manager could be planning to use ClearShares to launch its ETF business or its stake may be part of buying the rights to the BTC symbol, Seyffart said.  “Exchanges own the tickers and issuers can put a ticker on hold for a number of years or certain time period if an issuer has the rights to a ticker at a specific exchange that could be valuable,” he said.  Coinbase, for example, went to Nasdaq for its public listing because the exchange could offer it the COIN ticker.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/15/guess-who-might-be-buying-btc-grayscale-the-power-behind-gbtc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53f6fdeb6b7988f2752e63faccae043263f4df58-1300x867.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406217,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAessjJ,1618512509,Add Coinbase to the List of Crypto Stocks HSBC Won't Touch,"While Wall Street takes stock of Wednesday’s direct listing of cryptocurrency giant Coinbase, some buttoned-up U.K. banks will likely be avoiding COIN stock because of lingering worries about crypto’s role in money laundering and criminal activity.      A prime example is HSBC, which made headlines recently by banning customers from buying shares in MicroStrategy, a company holding large amounts of bitcoin on its balance sheet.      Asked if HSBC would also be avoiding Coinbase’s newly listed COIN stock, HSBC Corporate Media Relations Manager Ankit Patel said:    “HSBC has no appetite for direct exposure to virtual currencies and limited appetite to facilitate products or securities that derive their value from virtual currencies. This is not a new policy.”    Big U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and BNY Mellon are now fully awake to crypto and the need to stay competitive by fielding client demand for digital assets. That said, crypto businesses still struggle to get bank accounts. Silvergate and Signature Bank cater to much of the industry in the U.S., with firms like ClearBank doing the same in the U.K. and Europe.      The same feeling of cold feet from certain British banks also applies to dealing in shares of listed crypto firms.    Read more: Goldman Sachs to Enter Crypto Market ‘Soon’ With Custody Play: Source    During a recent initial public offering roadshow for mobile bitcoin app Mode (now listed on the London Stock Exchange), both HSBC and Barclays said they would not allow the firm’s shares on their respective platforms “because of the crypto element,” according to a source familiar with the matter.      Barclays press office did not respond to requests for comment about the COIN stock.    Pressure drop    Mode went through a stringent Financial Conduct Authority process to get listed on the LSE, explained the banking app’s executive chairman, Jonathan Rowland.      “I would not be surprised if there are some people [banks and fund managers] who will not be allowed to trade Coinbase because of their fund mandates and restrictions,” Rowland said in an interview. “There's a huge pressure on all these banks over money laundering, and it's just easier to say ‘no.’”      It’s well known that HSBC, the largest bank in Europe, with total assets of $2.715 trillion, is paranoid. The bank was forced to pay out $1.92 billion over anti-money laundering (AML) failings, only to be spanked again with the publication last year of the ""FinCEN Files.""    Read more: Barclays Is No Longer Banking Coinbase    At some point in the last couple of years, Barclays reversed its once-friendly position towards cryptocurrency companies. Barclays used to provide Coinbase with a bank account, the first and only big bank at that time to service a crypto company. It emerged in mid-2019 that the U.K. bank had quietly ended its business relationship with Coinbase.      Ex-Barclays banker and the former head of trading at Coinbase, Hunter Merghart, said he found the idea that HSBC and Barclays would eschew Coinbase stock surprising in this day and age.      “As a former banker myself, there’s a lot of fee generation, there’s going to be a lot of M&A, more IPOs – and if you as a bank say, ‘We don’t want our clients to get exposure,’ it’s going to be very hard to go and win that business,” said Merghart, now head of the U.S. business of crypto exchange Bitstamp, adding:    “If you look at the bankers for Coinbase, maybe some of the reason Goldman won that mandate is because they’ve been exploring digital assets for a long time.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/15/add-coinbase-to-the-list-of-crypto-stocks-hsbc-wont-touch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b294c5bfb28ca846432f9bef3fc7723c335722b-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406220,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAessnF,1618507221,Much Wow: Slim Jim Has a Dogecoin Strategy. News of It Sends DOGE to a New ATH,"Smoked meat stick vendor Slim Jim has an actual official dogecoin strategy. And it appears to be working, big time. News of this tie-up, which CoinDesk broke earlier Thursday, sent the price of DOGE to a new record.      The social media-savvy snack food saw its Twitter follower count increase 160% and tweet impressions soar to the moon (35 million impressions in 25 days) after it began engaging in Shiba Inu meme coin content last quarter, according to the CEO of parent company Conagra Brands.      “We've seen a marked uptick in audience interaction, including direct engagement and advocacy from the person [who] created dogecoin,” CEO Sean Connolly said on Conagra’s April 8 earnings call.      Exemplifying the hype-prone state of the cryptocurrency market right now, the publication of this story earlier today was enough to cause DOGE to more than double to a new high-water mark of 29.8 cents from 13.6 cents before the report. In recent trading, DOGE had settled down to 28.8 cents, up 127% on the day and more than 4,800% year to date.      On the earnings call, Connolly credited the dogecoin community with “playing a large part” in delivering Slim Jim the ultimate win in Adweek’s March Madness-themed brand face-off earlier this month.     See also: Dogecoin Is Not the Next Bitcoin – But Here Are the Similarities    The callout, apparently the first time dogecoin has ever been featured in an earnings call, and certainly the first instance of a public company deploying a bona fide strategy around DOGE (no, Elon’s memes don’t count), highlights how dogecoin has become a serious business while staying true to its roots as an objectively ridiculous meme coin.      The infinitely inflationary early bitcoin spin-off rocketed to new all-time highs amid a broad crypto-market rally that preceded Coinbase’s Nasdaq listing on Wednesday, and propelled further by this story. That DOGE is trading at record levels is a fact Slim Jim’s social team does not want its audience to forget.    Read more: It’s Part and Parcel of Crypto’: How Memes Drive Narrative and Value    Connolly said Slim Jim’s community “is built on memes,” which, as it happens, is dogecoin’s base, too. The dogecoin army relentlessly pumps its favorite crypto with memes on memes. Since March, some of those memes have come from Slim Jim.      Slim Jim’s Twitter account told CoinDesk the brand has built up a rapport with crypto fans to get to this point.      ""The Twitter family around doge engaged with us early March,"" Slim Jim told CoinDesk over DMs.      Connolly, the Conagra CEO, indicated the moon is not enough for Slim Jim; it will not let up until it reaches Mars.      “We're excited about this, and you should be on the lookout for additional crypto-themed activations in the future,” he said.

The hackers have used this information to send fraudulent emails and text messages to Celsius to trick them into revealing the private keys to their funds.      “On April 14, 2021, Celsius customers began reporting a fraudulent website claiming to be an official Celsius platform. We also became aware of some Celsius customers receiving SMS and email messages, that claimed to be official Celsius communication, linking to that website, and prompting recipients to enter sensitive information,” the email reads.      “An unauthorized party managed to gain access to a back-up third-party email distribution system which had connections to a partial customer email list. Once inside the system, this unauthorized party sent a fraudulent email announcement, of which we know some of the recipients to be Celsius customers.”      The team is still investigating how the hackers gained access to the phone numbers of Celsius' clients, considering the breach occurred with an email management system.

42406211,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAessgM,1618503678,Crypto Is Still the Frontier for Journalism,"Media is broken. No one is getting paid. Advertising is gross. Writers are incentivized to write garbage. The only interesting publications have rich benefactors – and all that can change in an instant.      The internet was supposed to revolutionize the way we share, consume and produce information – a democratization of content and creation. A revolution it was. But the slippery borders of the internet have made it hard for anything to matter. There’s a lot to process.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Someone once told me, “Writing on the internet is like breathing water.” I think that’s a pretty accurate description of the joys and horrors of the internet.      Not to mention the corporate entities that own the web, which have ad- and data-driven business models that corrupt the original vision of the internet. It’s difficult to say anything specific here – as no one really knows how these systems work. (A sit-down my colleague Ben Powers did with Shoshana Zuboff is a good place to start.)      For years, people have looked to cryptocurrency as a solution for the media crisis. Cryptocurrency adds friction to the web to make it more life-like. There are costs associated with even small acts. It disincentivizes noise. It makes the electronic indelible. If you have something to say, it better be worth it – it’s there forever (also preventing the sort of influence powerful people can exert, as with Peter Thiel and Gawker.)      Needless to say, many crypto-media projects have failed. Civil, a three-year experiment in tokenomics and media organization, folded after a series of internal disputes and the collapse of its token. But a new class of media projects and platforms seems to be emerging.      Substack, Ghost and Mirror are all promising platforms that are finding real use. These projects apply many of the core ideas of crypto – empowering individual voices, uncensorability and crowdfunding – if not the technology directly. Brick House, a writer-owned media collective involving several ex-Civil people, is partially informed by that project.      Untitled Frontiers is the latest to join the crowd. A new project by one of the fathers of the ERC-20 token standard, Simon de la Rouviere, looks to combine the buzzy world of NFTs with the fuzzier world of DAOs and other “Web 3.0” technologies to explore the edges of content creation.      The project is not yet launched – maybe not even coded – but CoinDesk reached out to de la Rouviere to talk about crypto’s role in the media. An artist and author at heart, it’s the ideas that matter most. His responses sent over email have been lightly edited for brevity.      What is fundamentally wrong with the media that UF is aiming to address?      It's best captured by a quote from internet pioneer Stewart Brand: ""On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it's so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.""      As we've seen with [non-fungible tokens], we can have the best of both. Information that is free (as in free to share and consume), but also ""expensive,"" meaning, accruing value. Untitled Frontier believes this will be most valuable at the intersection of fiction, because the most valuable collectibles have a story attached to them.      What is currently broken in the media and how could crypto or open-source technology be deployed to fix this?      There's an abundant catalogue of amazing media that can only be funded and enjoyed through:      1) requires content to be restricted and paid for (traditional sales like books, cinema, downloads) 2) ad revenue 3) subscription revenue (e.g., patreon or substack) 4) or crowdfunding      In most of these cases, the content has to be restricted in some form to be enjoyed. With NFTs specifically, it allows superfans to collect meaningful souvenirs related to the media, allowing the content to be more permissive, and secondly allows stronger connections between fans, the content and the creators. It's both a new funding model but also a new way for new media to flourish.      What do you think of open, but not decentralized, platforms like Substack? It seems to be having an outsized effect on the media ecosystem.      Substack is a step in the right direction. Some writers have been burned by platforms like Medium that changed user expectations over time. At least with Substack, the writer will always control and own their audience. If Substack fails or screws up, they can take their mailing list to a new platform.      How are you incorporating lessons from projects like Civil?      Many early media projects in the industry were just early. I learned that lesson with pioneering in the music industry with Ujo Music. We launched one of the first music NFTs back in 2017. The key takeaway isn't always that those projects were the wrong product. It was just at the wrong time.      You're known for your contributions to the ERC20 standard. Any novel technological features with UF?      We have to invent less technical innovations these days and can focus more on the product, users and the market. There's established infrastructure and an established market that will make our lives a lot easier.      You’ve discussed using NFTs as a funding mechanism to help support UF. How does this work?      This is an open-ended question and one that will be resolved by talking to specific writers. Initially, it will be pitched as a 50-50 split, after which it might change if writers decide a different split is sufficient.      It sounds like UF will take some editorial responsibility. Why is this the right path for an open platform?      Untitled Frontier at this stage acts more like a mixture between Disney + publisher, guiding a shared narrative. If successful, we hope to see more projects spinning up similar models for their own communities. Why might writers want to publish under a permissive license rather than maintaining property rights over their work?      The most permissive content travels the furthest (with a good distribution channel). However, doing so means that the creator won't necessarily make commensurate return on the value of the work due to the restrictions of current business models. NFTs change this paradigm by rewarding NFTs that are the most well known (the 'Mona Lisa' cryptomedia thesis). Thus, permissive stories that travel the furthest drives more value to NFT sales.      How long until The New York Times converts to a DAO model?

Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, jumped early Thursday to a new all-time high of $2,487.

A call option represents the right to buy, and the put option gives the right to sell.      While open interest has surged with the cryptocurrency's price, ether's one-month implied volatility (IV), or investors' expectation for price turbulence, remains low.      Volatility peaked above 190% (annualized) in January and fell to a four-month low of 73% on March 28. Since then, it is hovering in a narrow range below its lifetime average of 88%, confounding observers.      As noted by dominant exchange Deribit, expectations for price turbulence in crypto markets rise during both bull and bear runs. That's contrary to traditional markets, where implied volatility usually picks up during bear markets and subsides during bull runs.      According to Greg Magadini, CEO and co-founder of Genesis Volatility, ether's implied volatility is being dragged lower by bitcoin (BTC).      ""Although ETH holds an IV premium over BTC, I believe bitcoin options lead the crypto options market, and IV fatigue in BTC is possibly bleeding into ETH,"" Magadini told CoinDesk.      Bitcoin's one-month implied volatility is also hovering below its lifetime average of 74.7% at press time. However, ether's implied volatility will likely decouple from bitcoin's once institutional money flows into Ethereum's native cryptocurrency.      ""Bitcoin's market has gotten used to institutional inflows. However, ether has not had huge corporate buyers, and any news of that would be a ""surprise"" to the market,"" Magadini said. ""That makes ETH options interesting here.""      Also read: Bitcoin in Stasis as Crypto Bull Mike Novogratz Warns of Market Washout      Traders usually buy options when the market is seeing below-average implied volatility and sell options when the IV is too high.

42406216,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesskI,1618498200,Taproot Speedy Trial Code Merged Into Bitcoin Core,"The code for Taproot’s “Speedy Trial,” an activation method for Bitcoin’s biggest upgrade in years, has been merged into Bitcoin Core.      On April 15, Bitcoin Core developers Fanquake and Marco Falke merged two complementary pull requests authored by AJ Townes and Andrew Chow for Speedy Trial. With Speedy Trial now merged into Bitcoin Core’s source code, Taproot’s code is ready to start its first step toward activation when the code is released in May.      Bitcoin’s community, from developers to avid users, all agree that Taproot, which implements the Schnorr signature scheme into Bitcoin code, will be a boon for the network by making complex transactions (what the cool kids call “smart contracts”) more scalable and private.    Read more: How Bitcoin’s Taproot Upgrade Will Improve Technology Across Bitcoin’s Software Stack    No one has agreed on how to bring Taproot online, though. Because Bitcoin is decentralized, it requires painstaking coordination between actors to make sure an upgrade is released properly. After months and months of activation discussions led to a stalemate, Bitcoin developer David Harding and Russell O'Connor devised Speedy Trial as a way to put an end to the impasse.    How Speedy Trial works    The compromise allots a three-month activation window, during which time the network requires a certain threshold of miners to signal for the upgrade; if this threshold is reached, then Taproot is “locked in” and activates in November of this year.      Should this trial fail, then Taproot doesn’t activate (and the network will have only wasted three months trying, hence “speedy”).      Speedy Trial brokered an agreement between those who wanted an activation via Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 9, which means the upgrade fails if miners don’t adopt, and BIP8, which gives node operators (those running Bitcoin’s source code who act as “servers” for the network) an option to force the upgrade with a user activated soft fork if it fails.      Miners have shown no signs of blocking the upgrade, making the drawn-out discussions a source of frustration for some stakeholders.

42406223,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAessoE,1618497960,"Coinbase, Before It Was Inevitable","May 2013 was an exciting time for Brian Armstrong. His digital wallet startup had just won a bitcoin hackathon and snagged its first $5 million in venture funding. Olaf Carlson-Wee, who would later found Polychain Capital, had just joined Coinbase's scrappy “office” loft on San Francisco’s Bluxome Street.      It was exciting because Armstrong’s bid to bring bitcoin to the masses was taking off. Just nine months after pitching his startup, Coinbase, at a Y Combinator demo day, he and co-founder Fred Ehrsam had 109,000 users moving those $130-odd bitcoins 107,000 times a month.      He’d told demo day attendees that Coinbase would be the “easiest way to get started with bitcoin” – a gateway for a decentralized revolution in internet commerce that would cut out the credit cards, the banks, the middlemen and the fees.      “In my view, this is the potential of bitcoin,” Armstrong said on Y Combinator’s Hacker News forum, responding to a poster who said the founder of such an “interchange free system” might one day rank among “the wealthiest people in history.”    Read more: Coinbase Listing: The Journey From Y Combinator to Nasdaq    “I'm making a bet in this space,” Armstrong wrote, even as he doubted “a single company could pull it off.”      Coinbase did not pull it off. Its founder’s goal of turning bitcoin into a global payment rail for storefronts and merchants has largely failed. But Coinbase did succeed in becoming a go-to service for crypto newbies investing in bitcoin as an asset; increasingly it's also a go-to for Wall Street firms betting big on digital gold.      With Coinbase's Nasdaq debut now in the rearview, Armstrong is set to become one of the richest people in the world, joining the ranks of Silicon Valley's mega-elite.      But back in the early 2010s, the picture was far from clear.    Online archive    CoinDesk went digging through Coinbase’s earliest days to see how Brian Armstrong crafted his young company’s image online. There was no guarantee that prospective users would trust Coinbase with their cash or crypto. It was a battle Armstrong had to win over time.      In Coinbase's early days, Armstrong was focused on many of the same issues that preoccupy him today: reaching a mainstream audience, tackling tricky legal questions and keeping customers happy.      One of Armstrong’s earliest bitcoin posts on Hacker News displays his primary fear: that navigating the legal landscape would be a bitcoin killer. The dilemma: Either play nice with the Feds and reveal customer identities, or risk alienating the pro-anonymity bitcoin fan base.      “Anonymity … may not be as important to the masses. Not sure,"" he mused. He ultimately decided to play it safe and now he has 56 million registered users.    October 2012: Convincing the masses    Coinbase made a big step in 2012, winning the right to link Coinbase customer wallets directly with bank accounts.      “You’re correct to be wary of entering bank info like this on any new service,” Armstrong told blog readers upon the launch of bank integration. But it was a huge step for the startup; now people could now buy more bitcoin more seamlessly (Coinbase’s goal from the start). Pretty soon, Coinbase users were buying and selling $1 million in bitcoin a month.      All that new bitcoin needed a safe place to go. After calculating that Coinbase needed only 13% of its stash online during the average week, Armstrong placed the remaining 87% on a trio of thumb drives destined for cold storage. His method of choice? A safety deposit box. “At an actual bank,” he wrote.      Coinbase now has a gigantic custody business and, at last check, had $223 billion in customer crypto. It is not clear if Coinbase retains the safety deposit box.    January 2013: Coinbase reimburses disgruntled Redditor    Keeping up with demand was hard and sometimes, as now, there were run-ins with irate customers.      Back when a single rage-post could wreck a fledgling startup, the onus was on Armstrong to protect his growing brand. He did so through a hyper-personalized campaign to diffuse would-be haters, like in January 2013, when Coinbase tamed one disgruntled customer by feeding their hungry cats.Carlson-Wee took over customer service three months later.    July 2013: Bitcoin meetup at Bluxome Street    All the while, Armstrong was building a bitcoin-centered community around his fledgling business.      Armstrong and co-founder Fred Ehrsam threw a bitcoin social at Coinbase’s apartment on Bluxome Street in the summer of 2013. That ever-more-cramped office would only last another year before Coinbase relocated to downtown San Francisco. Six years later, the company pivoted entirely remote.      Armstrong had plenty of attendees the previous year’s meetup, too: “Was great meeting everyone at the bitcoin social tonight! This thing is really picking up steam,” the firm said in a tweet.      If the apartment office didn’t betray Coinbase’s scrappy early startup energy, then its three employees’ first website headshots – all repurposed, poorly cropped social photos featuring other people’s arms and shoulders – certainly did.    July 2013: The VCs arrive    By the summer of 2013, Armstrong and Co. were getting serious.      Armstrong and Ehrsam ditched their upcycled headshots in July 2013 for more corporate-friendly fare. What happened in the two months preceding? They’d landed a massive $5 million funding round (the biggest ever for a crypto startup at the time) from VCs such as Fred Wilson, co-founder of Union Square Ventures and an investor in Twitter, Tumblr and other successes. It was time to look the part.      Coinbase’s road from Series A to Nasdaq had plenty of bumps, legal obstacles, customer spats and hacks. But Armstrong’s bitcoin wallet ultimately prevailed in becoming one of the most visible crypto firms in the world.

Dubbed Chainlink 2.0, the network creates what its team calls “decentralized oracle networks” (DONs). These second-layer networks operate off-chain, meaning almost all of the data related to the smart contract is stored and computed off-chain before an oracle makes an input on the blockchain to trigger a smart contract’s outcome.      For example, if you had a smart contract that managed trades between ETH and UNI, Chainlink 2.0’s oracles would aggregate all the various exchange data for this pair and only feed the on-chain smart contract the exact price when needed.      Taking this further, for more complex smart contracts that require more data (like ones for options or collateralized tokens), something like off-chain oracle services could potentially mitigate miners front-running trades on-chain.      Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov likened these DONs to the application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers use for everyday computer functions (whenever you Google something and Google’s own result comes up, for weather or bitcoin price, for example, this data is pulled using an API.)      ""Our work with the top DeFi protocols has clearly shown us that in order to create the next generation of smart contracts developers need an easily accessible, provably secure and scalable set of decentralized services surrounding their smart contract code with key additional functionality,"" Nazarov told CoinDesk.

An open GitHub issue for the software version states there was a “node issue after Berlin hard fork, not [sic] sync after block 12244294."" The GitHub page’s comments include numerous Open Ethereum users whose nodes were knocked out of sync by the bug.      The Open Ethereum software version supports 12% of nodes on the Ethereum network.      Notably, the bug did not affect nodes running Ethereum’s most used client, Go Ethereum.    Coinbase pauses ETH withdrawals    Seemingly in response to the issue, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has disabled ETH and ERC-20 withdrawals, according to a tweet.      A Coinbase Support alert called ""Ethereum Berlin Network Upgrade"" noted that withdrawals were halted from both Coinbase and Coinbase Pro. Other services that relied on Open Ethereum like the Ethereum block explorer Etherscan and custodian BitGo were also affected by the bug.

42406202,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAessWW,1618494946,BTIG Initiates Coinbase Coverage With $500 Price Target,"The brokerage firm BTIG rated Coinbase (COIN) shares a ""buy"" with a $500 price target in a research report on Thursday.      BTIG calls COIN the “gold standard among digital asset exchanges” and says the company is poised for sustained growth as the crypto ecosystem expands.      COIN had a volatile first day of trading on the Nasdaq exchange. The stock opened around $318 and briefly broke above $400 before declining later in the session and closing at $328. The stock was up about 3% to $338 as U.S. stock markets opened early Thursday.    BTIG’s $500 price target for COIN is based on several base-case assumptions, including 16% growth in trading volumes for the next five years, subscription and services revenue growth of 30% over the same period, and continued retail adoption of cryptocurrencies on COIN’s platform.  The firm sees an upside scenario of accelerated revenue growth “beyond our current expectations as its crypto exchange’s market-share gains increase sharply and its other business lines ramp up more quickly than we are anticipating.”  However, Coinbase could also see revenue growth stall due to “either declining demand for cryptocurrency due to a sharp drop in the price of bitcoin and other coins.”  The report also notes a strong balance sheet for Coinbase, which could help the company “withstand downturns in crypto markets or fee compression arising from increased competition.”  Read more: Coinbase Shares Meet Crypto Volatility: First Soar, Then Fall to Close Below Opening Price",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/15/btig-initiates-coinbase-coverage-with-500-price-target,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/382ba4b214c19c7bb412da35876ad622884af2ea-1308x934.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406199,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAessXV,1618494133,"NYPD's Crypto Sleuthing Is Powered by Chainalysis, Documents Show","The New York Police Department (NYPD) has been using Chainalysis software to conduct blockchain investigations since 2019.      Though NYPD’s blockchain sleuthing efforts had been reported by The Block in January, it was not previously known which firm the nation’s largest police force had enlisted to help track suspect crypto transactions or how long it had been doing so.      The revelation comes as the NYPD quietly strengthens its rules governing who can use the cryptocurrency analysis tools and how the department stores the transaction data their investigations dig up.      Under a final policy document released Sunday, New York cops said they would only use the tools for “legitimate law enforcement purposes'' pre-authorized by an oversight board. A draft policy proposed in January would have permitted those tools “in any situation” the oversight board had seen fit.      Additionally, officers must now have “an articulable need” to conduct crypto transaction analysis before they’re allowed to use the agency’s tools. The previous proposal appeared to grant access to any “authorized user” with a username and password.      Chainalysis has established itself as one of law enforcement’s top allies in tracking cyber criminals who conduct business on public ledgers. The firm raked in $10 million in federal government contracts in 2020, but the company has told CoinDesk it maintains broad relationships with state and local police.      For its work with the NYPD, Chainalysis received an eight-month, $35,410 software licensing contract in October 2019. The New York-based firm subsequently agreed to a full-year deal worth $67,890 that granted NYPD use of its “intelligence collection tool.” That deal will expire at the end of August.      NYPD first divulged its crypto tracing policies in response to a June 2020 state law that sought to give the public more input on its high-tech toolkit. But the department had already been surveilling transactions for nearly a year, according to city records reviewed by CoinDesk.      NYPD did not respond to requests for comment.    Blockchain cops    Chainalysis, one of the largest private companies providing cryptocurrency tracing software to governments and crypto exchanges alike, last month raised a whopping $100 million from prominent backers.    Read more: Chainalysis Raises $100M, Underscoring Surging Demand for Blockchain Surveillance    Chainalysis Public Sector VP Chris Manouse told CoinDesk that local law enforcement agencies rely on transaction-tracing software to respond to cyber threats.      “Criminal activity involving cryptocurrency is directly impacting local communities,” he said in an email. “Ransomware is crippling local hospitals, schools, and governments. Individuals, including the elderly, are being targeted in scams and SIM swaps.”      Manouse declined to comment on Chainalysis’ relationship with NYPD.      In 2019 the department warned that scammers posing as Social Security administrators had bilked city residents of $2 million in bitcoin, gift cards and wire transfers.    Read more: NYPD Warns $2 Million Stolen in Scam Involving Bitcoin    NYPD training records reviewed by CoinDesk indicate the departments’ crypto investigations may stretch beyond ransomware and SIM swaps. The 2020 detective training coursebook offered lectures on managing darknet investigations.    Policy risks    Albert Fox Cahn, the founder and executive director of the New York City-based Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), said the NYPD approach reeks of overreach.      “This is a policy that's designed to hide more than it shows,” Cahn said in a phone call. “The policy doesn't specify what vendor it uses, it doesn't specify the capabilities being deployed, it gives the most high-level cryptic description you could imagine of the cryptocurrency analytics tool they're using.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Danny Nelson, Benjamin Powers",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/15/nypds-crypto-sleuthing-is-powered-by-chainalysis-documents-show,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4bd4a7cfb51b08d4ceeb6dfadea3fb3c7004348-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Part of a sweeping set of actions taken by the U.S. government to address alleged Russian government interference in its elections on Thursday, the Treasury Department announced it would identify digital currency addresses used by Second Eye Solution (SES), otherwise known as Forwarderz, which allegedly received some $2.5 million across nearly 27,000 transactions between 2013 and March 2021.      ""As part of today’s listing of SES on OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List), OFAC is also identifying digital currency addresses used by SES to fulfill customer orders in order to help assist financial institutions, and their third-party identity verification services, in identifying customers on their platforms who have purchased fraudulent identity documents,"" Treasury's press release said.      Following the publication of this article, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) published a list of addresses and entities accused of participating in the scheme. Addresses include bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, zcash, dash and verge, with 28 total addresses on the list.      In addition to SES, addresses are tied to the Association for Free Research and International Cooperation (linked to Russian national Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the alleged financier of the IRA) and Southfront, which is tied to the Russian Federal Security Service.      The U.S. has accused Russian government officials of meddling with its election before, and Thursday's actions formally include allegations that the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service was behind the massive SolarWinds cyberattack.      An executive order signed by President Joe Biden also mentions cryptocurrencies as a tool that may be used to bypass U.S. sanctions. The executive order states that any individual who uses ""deceptive or structured transactions or dealings to circumvent any United States sanctions, including through the use of digital currencies or assets or the use of physical assets"" should be blocked from transacting with or being paid by any U.S. person (meaning U.S. citizens or individuals residing on U.S. soil).      The U.S. has sanctioned crypto addresses on a handful of occasions before, including previously adding digital currency addresses and individuals accused of interfering with U.S. elections on behalf of the Russian government.

42406213,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAesshL,1618490038,Berlin Hard Fork Is Now Live on Ethereum,"Ethereum’s Berlin hard fork went live at block 12,244,000 Thursday.      The Berlin hard fork is a network upgrade that incorporates four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that tinker with gas prices and allow new transaction types. The upgrade is a stepping stone to the much bigger London hard fork, which will activate EIP 1559, a momentous (and controversial) change to Ethereum’s fee structure.      The EIPs are:    EIP-2565, which reduces gas cost for a specific transaction type that uses modular exponentiation.  EIP-2718, makes all transaction types “backwards compatible” using so-called “envelope transactions,” which allows the addition of new transaction logic into Ethereum.  EIP-2929, increases gas costs for “op code” transactions, a pain point for denial of service attacks on Ethereum in the past.  EIP-2930, a new transaction type (made possible by EIP-2718’s envelope transactions) which allows its users to create templates for future, complex transactions in a bid to lower gas costs.    The Berlin hard fork, named for the capital of Germany that played host to the first Ethereum DevCon, was originally scheduled for June or July 2020 but was pushed back owing to centralization concerns around the Geth client on which most Ethereum nodes operate.      This hard fork, which means old Ethereum clients will not be compatible with upgraded ones, is one of many on the road to Eth 2.0, Ethereum’s herculean leap from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.    Read more: Ethereum 2.0: How It Works and Why It Matters    The cortex of this new network, the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain, currently holds over $8 billion worth of ETH. This smart contract is like a bridge between the current Ethereum and Ethereum 2.0 blockchains, and it holds various deposits of the 32 ETH needed to run validator nodes on the new network (these validators take the place of proof-of-work miners.    Next stop, London    Berlin will be followed by London in July, which is expected to incorporate EIP-1559, a proposal that will reduce the supply of ether.      Instead of a user sending a gas fee to a miner for a transaction to be added to blockchain, the network would set the fee itself and then burn it.      There are concerns that this will diminish miners’ profits, but does have the potential to make ether more valuable due to limiting supply.

""I've seen a lot of weird coins like dogecoin and even XRP have huge retail spikes, which means there's a lot of frenzy right now,"" bitcoin bull and CEO of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz told MarketWatch. ""That never ends well, and so we'll probably have a washout at one point.""      The U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's shares (COIN) went live on Nasdaq on Wednesday, rising as high as $429.54 before closing the day at $328.      Being the crypto market leader, bitcoin broke out of its multi-week consolidation below $60,000 in the days leading up to the highly anticipated listing widely touted as a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry and clocked a record high of $64,801.79 on Wednesday. Corporate treasury money has been flowing into bitcoin mainly via Coinbase.      ""In hindsight, bitcoin printing a new all-time high on the day shares the opened for trading was a bit of an obvious one. You could even attribute some of the price appreciation this week squarely to this much-anticipated event,"" crypto exchange EQUOS said in its daily market analysis email.      However, XRP, dogecoin and few other cryptocurrencies also rallied despite not being listed on Coinbase. XRP picked up a bid near $0.6 on April 5 and clocked a three-year high of $1.9 on Wednesday – a 220% gain in nine days. Dogecoin has surged by 85% in the past three days.      As per Novogratz, that shows Coinbase's listing on Nasdaq created a lot of euphoria – a point of maximum financial risk where investors, primarily retailers, think good times will continue unchecked. It's usually the time when the market sees a temporary correction.    Buy the rumor ...    According to Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, the market is now seeing a classic sell-the-fact reaction to the news. Bitcoin, XRP and others have pulled back from the highs seen on Wednesday.      ""It’s quite common for a market to run up in anticipation of an event before then selling off on the news itself,"" Kruger told CoinDesk, adding that the cryptocurrency may track COIN in the short-term.      Coinbase's shares witnessed a two-way business or indecisive price action on the first day of trading, as noted earlier. If the share price drops in the coming days, the cryptocurrency may test $58,820, according to Equos.

""I would expect buying interest, detached in mindset from the noise of the day, to arrive and happily soak as weak hands leave the market.” Equos' analyst noted.      According to Kruger, the focus would soon shift back to the bigger picture and macro drivers. Data released earlier this week showed the U.S. headline inflation rose to a 12-month pace of 2.6% in March, strengthening the case for continued investments in store of value assets such as bitcoin and gold.      ""All those narratives are still true, and there's a lot of money on the sidelines, especially in the institutional world that has not been deployed yet,"" Alex Svanevik, the CEO of blockchain data company Nansen told CoinDesk.
