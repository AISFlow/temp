42378705,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZpH,1464724695,R3 Meets Obama Advisors at DC Blockchain Event,"Advisors to US President Barack Obama hosted distributed ledger banking consortium R3CEV and three other bitcoin and blockchain industry representatives at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC earlier this month.  Participating in the event were R3 managing director Tim Grant; Jerry Brito, executive director of non-profit advocacy group Coin Center; Joseph Bonneau, a researcher for the Applied Crypto Group at Stanford University; and Simon Johnson, professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management.  For over an hour on 20th May, the panel gave an overview of the technology to the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, answering questions about its current and potential impact on the US economy.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Grant said the event showcases how the President’s technology advisors want to stay informed on blockchain and distributed ledger developments.  Grant said:  ""What that means remains to be seen. But it leaves no doubt that it has reached the White House.""  A full recording of the event can be found here.  Lessons to the White House  Established in 1976, the Office of Science and Technology convenes its advisors throughout the year to “augment the science and technology advice available to [the President] from inside the White House and from cabinet departments and other Federal Agencies,” according to the event’s official agendahttps://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/public_agenda_may_2016_1.pdf.  In attendance at the event were council co-chair and assistant to the president for science and technology John Holdren and Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, among about two dozen others.  During a private lunch following the session, panelists answered questions from the advisors about blockchain technology, according to Grant.  Notably, members were said to be especially curious about the cryptographic nature of the technology and the potential role blockchain could play to minimize the likelihood of another Lehman Brothers-style collapse of the economy – a subject highlighted during R3's presentationhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/10.40%20D%20Grant.pdf at the event.  ""The general takeaway is that this in now very much on the radar of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology,"" said Grant. ""And that they are keen to continue being updated on this tech for all aspects of the economy. That came out loud and clear.""  Grant told CoinDesk:  ""I felt like I had a duty to express a balanced view of where we are in this distributed ledger community.""

42378702,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZt3,1464716249,Intel to Develop Blockchain Projects at New Innovation Lab in Israel,"Tech giant Intel has opened a development lab in Tel Aviv focused on financial technologies like the blockchain.  The company is working with The Floor, an Israeli FinTech organization, according to The Jerusalem Post. The Floor, headquartered at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, raised $2m earlier this year from Chinese VC firm Pando Group.  Other technologies that the lab will focus on include connected devices for the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing and biometric applications.  ""Through this collaboration, Intel will be able to lead, alongside The Floor, the development of this field in Israel and to widen the influence of technology on the financial field, from the user to the cloud,"" Sharon Puterman-Zafrir, manager of IoT for Intel’s Israeli division, said in a statement, according to the Post.  The company is no stranger to internal projects focused on applications of the blockchain, work that has been put on display through its industry partnerships.  In May, CoinDesk reported that Intel was exclusively developing mining chips for use by bitcoin startup 21 Inc.  Earlier this year, Intel unveiled an internal blockchain test through its work with the open-source Hyperledger project that simulated a fantasy sports marketplace where players exchanged virtual team shares. In April, Intel presented its formal contribution to the Hyperledger project, a distributed ledger platform it dubbed “Sawtooth Lake”.  Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42378699,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZkF,1464712736,Microsoft to Develop Identity Platform for Multiple Blockchains,"Tech giant Microsoft has partnered with startups Blockstack Labs and ConsenSys to build an open-source identity platform aimed at integrating the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.  An early version of the identity solution is expected to be available by the end of this summer.  In a blog post published today, Microsoft global business strategist Yorke Rhodes wrote that in the coming weeks Microsoft will launch an open source framework on Azure, where developers can build their own identity applications.  Rhodes told CoinDesk that this cross-chain applicability was of particular importance to those involved with the initiative.  He said in a statement:  ""Important to the open source blockchain identity initiative is that it is ubiquitous across chains and survivable over time. This mandates an initial solution and partners to prove it out that are cross chain. We are excited to see what this collaboration produces.""  Cross-chain platform  Connectivity with the Ethereum blockchain will take place via ConsenSys' uPort solution, and Blockstack’s OneName product will be used to integrate the platform with the bitcoin blockchain.  According to Microsoft, an early stage framework will be published on its Azure cloud computing platform. The platform has seen a number of blockchain integrations since it began offering services focused on the technology last year.  ConsenSys chief strategy officer Sam Cassatt highlighted the cross-blockchain nature of the project, saying that he believes providing a reliable form of identity to developing nations would be more effective across multiple chains.  ""While we have two fairly robust blockchain technologies, we think it’s important for the self-sovereign and humanitarian ends of our project, that we partner in such a way that provides access to as many people as possible,"" he told CoinDesk.  Focus on identity  The project comes amid growing interest among global organizations in the use of blockchain technology to address long-standing issues related to identity in developing nations.  According to the World Bank, as many as 1.5 billion people worldwide lack ""legal identity,"" making it much more difficult for them to obtain a bank account and access other services including education and social welfare programs.  The partnership itself was solidified in New York last week at the ID2020 Summit hosted in the United Nations building, an event aimed at highlighting the issue and the ways in which technology can provide potential solutions.  Groups like the Commonwealth Secretariat, the executive arm of the Commonwealth of Nations, have also been eyeing the issue, particularly on the applicability of blockchain. The Commonwealth is currently developing its own blockchain messaging service with identity protections.  Blockstack co-founder Muneeb Ali, described today's announcement to CoinDesk in a statement:  ""Our collaboration with Microsoft and ConsenSys can lead to a global standard for blockchain identity and creating new identities can become as easy as creating new email accounts.""

42378706,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZuJ,1464706305,Japan’s Trade Ministry: Government Should Promote Blockchain Use Cases,"Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has released the results of a new survey on blockchain technology, recommending that government groups play a leading role in “verifying the validity” of its use cases.  Prepared in conjunction with Nomura Research Institute (NRI), the 75-page report provides an overview of the technology, from detailing the step-by-step workings of a bitcoin transaction to outlining how the mechanics of the protocol could create stresses if applied to existing business practices.  Most notably, the report outlines the specific use cases it sees as being valuable for the government to explore, as well as why the government should have an incentive to play an active role in this experimentation process.  The report states:  ""The government can promote hypothesis verification concerning blockchains and accumulate and broadly publicize outcomes and challenges in Japan, thereby efficiently facilitating the development of the relevant market.""  Use cases cited in the report include asset management; authentication; commercial distribution management; communication; content; crowdfunding; finance (a definition that captures remittance, settlement, etc); Internet of Things (IoT); loyalty points and rewards; medical services; prediction markets; public elections; sharing and storage.  But the report goes on to suggest that not all these use cases maximize the effectiveness of the technology. In some instances, it argues, the cost of replacing existing systems would be prohibitively large.  Further, the METI report goes to note challenges to both the architecture of blockchain-based systems, as well as their integration by existing businesses, that could hinder development going forward.  In terms of technology, researchers noted that ""synchronization"" between the blockchain and the real world may prove challenging, and suggested it believes that the immutability of the system could be a problematic feature.  For business applications, the report theorized that service-level agreements would need to be developed by those who manage private blockchains, and that efforts would need to be made to ensure the volatility of token-based assets are not subject to price fluctuations.

42378703,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZo1,1464698405,Will Ethereum Beat Bitcoin to Mainstream Microtransactions?,"Micropayments have long been one of the most hotly-anticipated use cases for bitcoin, but similar tech may be coming soon to Ethereum, the decentralized blockchain network that has recently rejuvenated outside interest in the cryptocurrency space.  While payments that cost fractions of a cent have historically been prohibitive on the Internet, supporters of the use case believe it could one day enable everything from alternative ways of paying for art and journalism to promoting tipping on social media.  Market observers have forecasted that there could also be a lucrative market for the businesses that enable this future. Financial services firm Wedbush Securities, for example, has predicted bitcoin micropayments could be a $925bn market by 2025.  One of the earliest projects seeking to use the Ethereum platform for micropayments is Raiden Network, spearheaded by developer Heiko Hees, founder and CEO of Brainbot, a German-based smart contract and blockchain consulting company.  Hees believes the Ethereum network could prove to be the biggest enabler of micropayments, and that such transactions would cost less than they would on the bitcoin blockchain and be settled faster. A common annoyance for users of bitcoin, is that blocks on the network take 10 minutes to be processed, and to complicate matters, the standard practice by those who use the blockchain is to wait six confirmations until considering such transactions settled.  Ethereum, by contrast, has set its target on 12-second block times (though current block times are closer to 15 seconds), presenting perhaps the most notable possible solution.  But, Hees doesn't exactly see consumers interacting with micropayments. Rather, he is about machine-to-machine asset transfers, where machines, whether factory machines or drones, are the ones transferring value.  Hees called this ability a ""building block"" of the Internet of Things and offered the example whereby a machine could purchase resources, like the temperature in another room, based on predefined instructions. The vision is by no means unusual, even for an industry prone to big ideas.  Bitcoin's best-funded startup, 21 Inc, has been heavily focused on machine-to-machine payments, recently revealing Sensor21, a proof-of-concept for how machines could use its platform to buy and sell data related to the weather.  ""This can spawn a whole new economy if you allow these very tiny transfers,"" he said, adding:  ""Machines will do many, many transactions – probably more transactions than humans will ever do.""  Scaling up  And then there’s the ""future of blockchain architecture"" consideration.  The Raiden network, when implemented, might help boost overall capacity of Ethereum. Hees said that Raiden network and will scale up the Ethereum network from 25 transactions per second to more than 1 million transactions per second. And Raiden Network aims to increase the availability other powerful Ethereum abilities, including some types of smart contracts.  If you talk to most decentralized currency enthusiasts, bringing the technology to more people is a huge priority. But blockchains can’t currently support the transactions of millions of people – bitcoin and Ethereum support seven and 25 per second respectively, while Visa can support 45,000 – and this limitation with public blockchain networks has become more widely understood with bitcoin’s divisive block size debate.  Every node on the bitcoin and Ethereum networks, which are today run by everyday users, keeps a record of all transactions made in order to verify new transactions. The more transactions, the more cumbersome it is to run a node.  In bitcoin, a proposal called the Lightning Network has become a popular suggested fix since the white paper was released in February 2015 by developers Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja.  Lightning-style, off-chain transactions could make decentralized money easier to use and bring the technology's capabilities closer to how users were told it was ""supposed to be"" – fast and nearly limitless in supply, while still maintaining decentralization, a feature that distinguishes bitcoin and Ethereum from other digital payment methods.  According to this vision, most transactions will be made ""off-chain,"" lifting the burden from the underlying blockchain.  The reason that this works, in theory (since the technology is not yet live, some developers speculate that it could become too centralized in practice), is that either party can kick the transaction back to the blockchain anytime they want, thus giving both parties the ability to end the interaction.  Of course, Ethereum and bitcoin are different beasts. Ethereum is branded as ""the world computer"", and is often associated with the ambitious goal of enabling the ""total decentralization"" of the Internet. It’s a flexible system that supports smart contracts and a range of experimental, decentralized applications, including an uncensorable Twitter and Augur, a project that wants to decentralize prediction markets.  Still, even though the technology is different, scalability limitations still apply.  Ethereum plans to transition from proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, which could help with scalability. But some developers question its level of security.  Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin grappled with this problem in a series of blog posts and a white paper, suggesting a variety of methods, such as ""hypercubes"" to help the system support more people.  Ethereum's advantages  These scaling issues aside, Hees said that Raiden's implementation on Ethereum borrows many of the techniques from Lightning Network but that implementing them will be easier on Ethereum.  ""It’s rather complex to implement on bitcoin because you have to use the limited features that bitcoin provides in its crypto language. In Ethereum, regarding the deposits on the blockchain and settlement contracts, that’s pretty straightforward,"" he said.  This opinion is shared by other Ethereum-minded developers, including blogger Robert McCone who has argued that the Raiden network could live ""within"" Ethereum, rather than on top of the network, like in bitcoin, thus reducing complexity.  Raiden network uses two-way micropayment channels so that users can update the transaction amount in both directions.  This would mean you don’t need to connect users directly to their buddy or a barista using a payment channel, because they can ""chain channels,"" or send the payment through a network of middlemen until it reaches the recipient.  Intermediaries can’t steal the money because of a trick called Hashed TimeLock Contracts, as described in the Lightning Network paper.  Hees explained:  “If you transfer from Alice to Bob to Charlie, what prevents Bob from running away with the money is Alice would hash lock the transfer to Bob with a secret and Bob could only claim that amount on the blockchain if Alice reveals the secret. But Alice will not reveal the secret until she learns that Charlie receives the transfer from Bob. Transfers are locked and cannot be settled on the blockchain until the secret is.”  For providing the service, each hop in the chain of channels will receive a small transaction fee before it reaches the recipient.  And there might be other potential benefits of an off-chain network.  Hees, for example, highlighted that Raiden-type tech is a bright opportunity for privacy, a value long consistent with developers in the blockchain industry.  ""But if you have off-chain transactions then it’s not obvious that you’re sending to some other party. You’re sending directly to another party without involving a global ledger recalling all these transactions,"" he said.  Once Raiden network is set up, Hees thinks that a decentralized exchange of different assets, where users don’t need to hand over funds to an intermediary, will come naturally.  Hees plans to unveil a prototype of the network in the next three months.

42378710,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lZvZ,1464692241,Smart Dubai Director Sees Blockchain as Key to Connected Cities,"The head of the Dubai government’s Smart Dubai initiative provided new details on how she believes blockchain can help drive the city’s modernization efforts in a speech at industry conference Keynote 2016 yesterday.  In remarks, director general at the Smart Dubai Office, Dr Aisha Bin Bishr, spoke broadly about her organization’s plans to help make Dubai the best connected and ""happiest"" city in the world. Further, Bin Bishr discussed how blockchain fits into this larger strategy, while touching on her work with the Global Blockchain Council (GBC), the public-private tech initiative of which the Smart Dubai Office is a member.  In line with these goals, Bin Bishr sees blockchain as a technology that could power the Internet of Things (IoT) and ultimately help streamline the delivery of government services to smartphone devices.  Bin Bishr told the audience:  ""Blockchain technology is one of the most elegant and advanced technologies for cross-business efficiencies. We believe blockchain will have an important role in boosting productivity, increasing the competitiveness of Dubai and securing our economic infrastructure.""  Bin Bishr went on to characterize blockchain as a missing piece that could help her government, and those around the globe realize their visions for more connected cities by allowing the massive amounts of data that will be required to be better managed, while enabling benefits for end-users.  This March, for example, Smart Dubai announced the Smart Dubai Platform, a technology described as the ""digital backbone"" that would power the city. The effort is being built with local telecom giant du, and it is this union of IoT, cloud services and big data that Bin Bishr suggested she sees blockchain playing a role.  ""With blockchain, we believe that decentralizing the decision-making will add a lot of value, [allowing residents] to transact in a personal and seamless manner [and] creating a more efficient economy for all,"" she said.  More specifically, Bin Bishr said that her organization is investigating how blockchain tech can be used to create identity solutions that would reduce the ""pain"" that users now experience when transferring authenticating data.  Overall, the conversation showcased how the Smart Dubai Office plans to leverage blockchain tech as part of a wide variety of new technologies for the benefit of the city.
