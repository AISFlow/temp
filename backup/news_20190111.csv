42430110,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRKrh,1547246723,Grayscale Assures Investors: Ethereum Classic Trust Funds Not at 'Direct Risk',"In the wake of a 51 percent attack on ethereum classic (ETC), the manager of an investment vehicle that holds the cryptocurrency has been fielding inquiries from investors looking to understand if the underlying assets in the fund are safe, CoinDesk has learned.  On Monday, the day after the reorganization of transactions on the ethereum classic blockchain came to light, Grayscale Investments, the creator of the Ethereum Classic Investment Trust (ETCG), says it sent emails in response to ""a few"" clients asking for clarity on what the attack meant. A copy of an email response to such an inquiry was obtained by CoinDesk.  Grayscale said it had not sent a notification to all investors in the fund.  While mostly providing a general explanation of how such attacks work, Matt Beck, a product development and research associate at Grayscale, wrote in the email:  ""The greatest risk this poses is to the integrity of the Ethereum Classic Network, as people may be less inclined to accept ETC given the increased double-spend risk. However, the coins within the ETC Trust are not at direct risk of theft or double-spending.""  In explaining why, Beck cited a quote in Breakermag last year from a developer of another cryptocurrency project, Vertcoin, which suffered a similar attack.  ""Double spending can only be done by the original sender of the coins — so an attacker can only double spend his own coins, not someone else’s,"" the Vertcoin developer, Gert-Jaap Glasbergen, said in the article. ""So, the main risk of 51 percent attacks and blockchain reorgs is with people [who] accept the blockchain’s asset; and mostly when they do so in large amounts in exchange for virtual goods or services that are non-reversible.”  Beck also referenced a CoinDesk column by Michael J. Casey about the Vertcoin incident, which noted that 51 percent attacks are a risk faced by most proof-of-work blockchains and that some are more vulnerable than others depending on the amount of hashing power that secures the network.  Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale, told CoinDesk through a spokesman:  “As often occurs following developments in the digital asset ecosystem, Grayscale received inquiries from a few investors about the recent 51 percent attack on the ETC network. We provided investors who contacted us with publicly-available information explaining how these attacks occur. These types of network attacks and their implications are also described in the disclosure documents we provide all investors.”  As of Dec. 31, the trust had $24.9 millionhttps://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ETC-Trust-Fact-Sheet-January-2019.pdf of assets under management. Like CoinDesk, Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG).  'Hands off'  Stepping back, it's important to note that despite the severity of the 51 percent attack – one exchange lost $200,000 as a result – ethereum classic's price has held fairly steady, at least by crypto's volatile standards.  According to CoinMarketCap, it dropped from $5.49 on Sunday, shortly before the reorg became public knowledge, to a 7-day low of $4.28 on Thursday, a 21 percent decline. On Friday afternoon it was back up to $4.54.  The value of shares in ETCG has tracked the currency's decline over this period, falling from $9 at midday Monday to $6.78 Thursday before rebounding to $7.30 Friday afternoon.  That relative market calm may help explain why Grayscale sent its explainer only to the few investors who asked rather than a doing broader shareholder communication.  The trust was launched in 2017 as a private placement. As such, only accredited investors can buy shares directly from Grayscale, and they must hold them for at least a year before redeeming. In that sense, they are locked in for a time. Since May of last year, ETCG shares have been available for purchase or sale on OTCQX, an over-the-counter (OTC) market.  Grayscale appears to have stayed out of the developer community's discussions of the attack. Yaz Khoury of the Ethereum Classic Cooperative, which supports the development of the protocol, said that although Grayscale provides a fair amount of funding to his organization through the trust, ""other than provide financial help and advice to the Cooperative, they're very hands-off in how we manage to help the ETC community and ecosystem.""  Similarly, developer Cody Burns said of Grayscale: ""They tend not to meddle in projects development. They are focused on finance.""  Christine Kim contributed reporting.

Expected to activate  next Wednesday, Jan. 16, Constantinople is a type of upgrade known as a hard fork – which means it needs to be unilaterally installed across all nodes in the network to function as intended.  This approach is a process that comes with inherent risks. For example, if a sufficient number of users don’t agree with an upgrade, it could cause the network to split. Such an event took place in 2016 when a controversial hard fork following the collapse of the DAO led to the emergence of two distinct blockchains, ethereum and ethereum classic.  Still, Afri Schoedon, release manager for the Parity ethereum client, said that risk of a chain split is low because adoption of the upgrade by ethereum’s top mining pools – the parties most critical in avoiding a chain split – has been strong.  “Miners are prepared,” Schoedon said. “Only miners can split the chain.”  Currently, a tracking website ran by Peter Pratscher, the CEO of top ether mining pool Ethermine, tracks Constantinople adoption to be a mere 15.6 percenthttps://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkwatch/overview. Speaking to CoinDesk, Pratscher said that the statistics are flawed, and claimed the adoption to be closer to a majority.  “We expect most of the not-updated nodes to be updated by the time the fork block arrives,” Pratscher said.  Named after the capital of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople forms part of a three-part upgrade called Metropolis. It combines a total of five ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs). And while the majority are non-controversial tweaks, one aspect of the upgrade has been the cause of some controversy.  In particular, Constantinople delays the “difficulty-bomb,” an algorithm in ethereum's codebase that increases mining difficulty over time. Because the upgrade will decrease the mining difficulty, it also takes steps to reduce the reward miners are given for securing the network – down from 3 ETH to 2 ETH per block.  This has led miners to express discontent with the upgrade. But at the same time, major mining pools have stepped up in support of the change.  “We expect a smooth upgrade without any issues,” Pratscher remarked.  Splits aside, there are also other risks to a system-wide network upgrade as well. Code bugs can cause networks to splinter, and algorithms can go awry, leading to unanticipated difficulties. But developers are confident that such risks are minimal in Constantinople, and in the months leading up to next week's event, testing has sought to sniff out vulnerabilities in the software.  “We have testing and monitoring software such as our fork monitor and protocol fuzz tester that constantly monitor for issues before, during, and after hard forks,” Hudson Jameson said,  “We are very excited to be implementing these changes to the ethereum protocol. However, we put the safety and stability of the network first and foremost.”  Array of upgrades  Constantinople introduces five new upgrades to the network.  As previously detailed by CoinDesk, these include optimizations for developers that seek to make smart contract and decentralized application design more approachable.  Taylor Monahan, the CEO of ethereum wallet MyCrypto, described the overall thrust of the Constantinople upgrade as “simple quality-of-life improvements for contract development.”  According to core developer Nick Johnson, one such upgrade, EIP 1283, involves what is called “net gas metering.” Originally authored by Johnson, this element will improve one of ethereum’s ongoing usability issues – its rising gas costs.  “With it, we can reduce unnecessary gas overhead for contracts, as well as making new coding patterns cost-effective,” he said.  Another upgrade – cited by several developers as the most exciting of the Constantinople change – is EIP 1014. Also called Skinny CREATE2, the upgrade is expected to pave way for new kinds of layer two scaling solutions, such as state channels.  “It makes it possible to create new types of state channels that reduce or even eliminate onchain deployment costs, which improves scalability and reduces costs and hassle for users,” Johnson said.  According to Turbo Geth’s Alexey Akhunov, EIP 1014 could impact future ethereum changes, such as the potential implementation of rent or rolling costs for storing data on the ethereum platform. And it could lead to other, unanticipated new smart contract features as well.  “Another exciting (and potentially dangerous) thing that CREATE2 enables [is] recreating the contracts at the same address after they have been destroyed,” Akhunov said, explaining:  “This recreation can be done either with the same code, or (with a bit more trickery) with a different code – which basically leads to fully-upgradable contracts.”  Constantinople also includes 2 further upgrades – EIP 145 and EIP 1052 – which will improve ease-of-use for smart contract development and streamline certain operations within ethereum’s code.  “With these improvements we can expand what we can do easily with the ethereum chain to encompass more use-cases,” Johnson said.  Miner debates  Still, while the majority of Constantinople includes well-tested and technically straightforward changes, there’s another code change that has been hotly debated. Authored by Parity’s Afri Schoedon, the code change in question is EIP 1234.  And that’s because one of the main aspects of Constantinople is a delay for what is known as the “difficulty bomb"" alongside the aforementioned technical features.  Originally intended to smooth the transition to ethereum’s upcoming consensus switch, proof-of-stake, the difficulty bomb is an algorithm that incrementally increases the time it takes to produce new blocks.  Eventually, the bomb forces the blockchain into a state known as the “ice age,” during which time the difficulty becomes so high that transactions can no longer be confirmed. As such, the algorithm also has the benefit of encouraging frequent code changes in order to modify it.  According to Akhunov, delaying the difficulty bomb is the most critical aspect of Constantinople.  “The main importance of Constantinople is to delay the difficulty bomb, otherwise mining difficulty would start climbing up sharply. Other than that, there are no changes that are really crucial,” he said.  However, delaying the difficulty bomb comes with its own subtleties. And that’s because the speed at which blocks are produced on ethereum also determines the regularity by which the platform’s internal cryptocurrency, ether, is issued.  To that end, Constantinople decreases block mining rewards from 3 ETH to 2 ETH per block – a move that sparked controversy with the blockchain’s miners that depend on the rewards to keep their mining businesses profitable.  Heightening the controversy is the emergence of increasingly specialized mining hardware for ethereum, which according to some, risks making mining operations for hobbyist miners – often running GPU hardware, rather than specialized ASICs – less feasible.  “In general we are not looking forward to the ethereum Constantinople upgrade,” Ethermine's Pratscher said. “[Constantinople] will make mining unprofitable for a lot of miners which will have a negative impact on the security of the ethereum network.”  Pratscher cited the recent attack on ethereum classic, in which the blockchain was overwhelmed by hostile hashpower, as an example of the problems that can occur if there are fewer miners present.  “That 51 percent attacks are a real threat is currently shown by the recent attack executed against the [ethereum classic] network,” he said.  Brian Venturo, who operates a small mining pool called Atlantic Crypto, echoed these concerns, telling CoinDesk:  “EIP-1234 in Constantinople will immediately add pressure to mining economics.”  The next phase  Due to this upcoming reduction in miner payouts, miners such as Pratscher and Venturo are banking on a potential future upgrade, named ProgPoW, that promises to block specialized ASIC hardware from the network and ensure that GPU mining remains competitive.  At press time, it is unclear whether such a change will be deployed. While it was given a “tentative” go ahead at a developer meeting in early January, discussions regarding the proposal have failed to reach a consensus since then.  Still, developers are confident that technical work will continue in the coming months, as layer two scaling enhancements continue to mature, and the formative aspects of ethereum’s long-awaited upgrade – Serenity – begin to crystallize.  All things considered, the upcoming upgrade has fostered a mood of careful apprehension.  “I am slightly nervous about Constantinople, because it is always hard to guess how likely it is that something goes wrong,” Akhunov said.  According to Akhunov, under the worst-case scenario, something goes wrong with the new difficulty algorithm and causes disruption to the security of the network. Other developers cited consensus issues as the biggest concern. Taylor Monahan of MyCrypto said she was most worried by the potential of scammers to use the upgrade as an opportunity to trick people out of their funds.  But irrespective of the risks involved in the upgrade, developers are confident that they’ve taken every possible step to secure the upgrade. Additionally, there are certain advantages to the difficulty bomb as well.  For example, even if certain nodes get left behind on the Byzantium software, the upcoming difficulty bomb means that it will become unusable in the coming months, and will be forced to upgrade in order to continue transacting on ethereum.  For that reason, Monahan said that Constantinople “feels nice.”  “Everyone’s hard work is paying off,” she said, adding:  “A lot of people will benefit from the improvements (even if they don’t realize it) via cheaper contracts, more efficient opcodes, and opening more possibilities for contract interaction.”  Astronomical clock image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/01/11/what-to-expect-when-ethereums-constantinople-hard-fork-happens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/25c6ac79e05a94c3e2fe03578a6f054c14b136a1-1500x1053.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Revealed on a new website, escobartrump.org, the new token has been dubbed the ESCOBAR and is an ethereum ERC-20-based stablecoin it claims will be pegged to the U.S. dollar. The project was founded by Escobar's elder brother, Roberto.  The website further claims:  ""The token came to existence as a tool to raise money for the Impeach Trump Fund cause, where a GoFundMe fundraiser was shut down and censored. Thanks to cryptocurrencies, there are no boundaries to be censored!""  The project is currently holding an ICO pre-sale of 200 million tokens, which launched Wednesday and runs until May 10. Altogether the Escobar estate hopes to sell 1 billion ESCOBARS, according to its white paper. By June, the website claims, the stablecoin will be redeemable for dollars via a company in Belize.  Olof Gustafsson, CEO at Escobar Inc., told The Next Web that the plan had been to raise $50 million via the GoFundMe campaign they'd titled ""ByeByeTrump."" But after their campaign was blocked on the platform, they'd decided to immediately launch the token, he claimed.  Gustafsson went on to say:  “After raising $10 million in just 10 hours we were shut down by GoFundMe and within 24 hours launched the ESCOBAR stablecoin cryptocurrency to avoid anyone censoring us again. We believe the Trump Administration [sic] or President Trump shut us down.”  The GoFundMe claims are yet to be confirmed, said TNW, although it published a screenshot provided by Escobar Inc. purporting to be the campaign page with $10 million donated.  On another site for its Trump impeachment campaign, Roberto Escobar is openly described as the former co-founder of the Medellín drug cartel alongside Pablo, ""where Roberto used to be the accountant responsible for over $100 billion in profits.""  Escobar Inc. previously released another crypto called dietbitcoin that seems to have flopped. The website for sales of that token is currently classed by Google Chrome as a security risk to visitors.  Whether this latest cryptocurrency touted by the co-founder of a drugs cartel will do any better remains to be seen.

Monex Group, the Japan-based online brokerage firm that acquired Coincheck for $33.5 million following the cyberattack, announced Friday that the exchange is now registered with the Kanto Financial Bureau, under the country’s Payment Service Act, effective immediately.  The license was approved by the country's Financial Services Agency (FSA), on the basis of Coincheck’s improved risk management and governance systems with “concrete internal controls and customer protection in mind,” Monex said.  Following the massive hack of around 500 million NEM tokens in January 2018, the FSA had ordered Coincheck to strengthen its security systems and submit a business management improvement plan to the authority. At the time, the exchange was not registered with the regulator.  The breach also forced Coincheck to suspend its services for some months. Since then, the exchange has been phasing back in its operations. By November 2018, it had reinstated services for all listed cryptos on its platform.  Now with the license in place, Coincheck joins the growing list of regulated crypto exchanges in the country, including financial services giant SBI Holdings, which operates a registered platform called VCTRADE. U.S.-based exchange unicorn Coinbase has previously said it expects to become licensed in Japan in 2019.  All crypto exchanges in Japan came under anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) rules in April of 2017 when the country’s legislature passed the Payment Service Act and recognized bitcoin as a legal method of payment.  Over 160 firms are planning to apply for the crypto exchange license, the FSA said back in September, adding that it is looking to increase its staffing levels to speed up the review process.

The round was led by early-stage venture capital firm Crowberry Capital and included participation from private investment firm Hof Holdings, both also based in Iceland.  Founded in 2016, Monerium is a fintech startup led by, among others, Jon Helgi Egilsson, former chairman of the Central Bank of Iceland. The firm is developing a solution for transacting fiat currencies over blockchains, what it calls ""e-money."" The seed funding will be used to accelerate development of its services.  Monerium ultimately aims to issue ""asset-backed, redeemable and regulated e-money"" over blockchains once it becomes a licensed institution, saying its products would make blockchains ""more relevant and useful"" to financial institutions and enterprises.  While not yet licensed within the EU, its application is in progress, according to the announcement.  Monerium CEO Sveinn Valfells said:  “Becoming a licensed financial institution is the next key step for Monerium in order to assume full responsibility for and control over the complete range of functions required to issue e-money on blockchains: asset management, compliance, risk management, and product development.”  Andrew Keys, co-founder of ConsenSys Capital, added that his firm is “dedicated to supporting companies building the infrastructure needed for a more decentralized and self-sovereign future.”  Back in November, ConsenSys led a $2.1 million seed round for AZTEC, a startup working to make ethereum transactions private and thereby encourage financial institutions to use the second-largest blockchain.  A month prior, it was the sole investor in a $6.5 million fundraise for DrumG Technologies, a blockchain startup formed by R3 former head of business development Tim Grant.

42430119,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRL9h,1547204416,Bitcoin Price Looks South After Worst Daily Loss Since November,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price saw its biggest drop for seven weeks on Thursday, weakening the prospects of a bullish breakout above $4,100.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market value hit a 3.5-week low of $3,503 yesterday, before closing (as per UTC) at $3,627 – down 9.4 percent on the day. That was the biggest single-day drop since Nov. 24 and the fourth biggest daily loss of the last two months, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Essentially, the hard-fought gains of the last two weeks have been erased in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency had carved out a bullish-higher low near $3,550 on Dec. 27 before crossing $4,000 on Jan. 6.  The follow-through to break above $4,000, however, was anything but encouraging. Moreover, signs of bullish exhaustion emerged near the crucial resistance of $4,130 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) and demoralized bulls started to exit the market yesterday, leading to a sharp drop in prices.  As a result, the bears may be feeling emboldened and could attack the crucial support lined up near $3,550. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,630.  Daily chart        Bitcoin fell to $3,500 yesterday, confirming a bearish doji reversal on the daily chart. The cryptocurrency also closed below the crucial 50-day moving average (MA) support,  Adding credence to the bearish move, trading volumes jumped to the highest level since Dec. 21 and 14-day relative strength index (RSI) breached the ascending trendline to the downside.  With the odds stacked in favor of the bears, the immediate support of $3,566 (Dec. 27 low) could be breached soon. That would only bolster the already bearish technical setup.  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, BTC has created a bearish outside reversal candle – this week's price action has engulfed the previous week's high and low - having failed to penetrate the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) hurdle for four weeks straight.  The candlestick pattern indicates that the week began with optimism, but is approaching a more pessimistic close. As a result, it is widely considered a sign of bearish reversal.  Put simply, the doors have been opened for a re-test of the 200-week MA lined up at $3,250. Supporting that bearish case is the downward sloping 10-week MA.  View  BTC risks breaching the bullish-higher low of $3,566 over the weekend. That would add credence to the bearish setup on the weekly chart and open the doors to $3,250 (200-week SMA).  A quick recovery above $4,000 would abort the bearish setup, although the probability of BTC picking up a strong bid in the short-term is quite low.  A convincing weekly close (Sunday's UTC close) above the 200-week EMA $4,148 will likely put the bulls back into the driver's seat and allow a stronger rally towards $5,000.

42430118,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRL5h,1547202431,NASA Eyes Blockchain Tech to Secure Aircraft Flight Data,"NASA – the National Aeronautics and Space Administration – is examining blockchain technology as a means to ensure the privacy and security of aircraft flight data.  Ronald Reisman, an aero-computer engineer at NASA Ames Research Center, published a paper on Monday, suggesting that blockchain networks and smart contracts can help mitigate some security issues.  Starting Jan. 1, 2020, the U.S. has been mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to use a new surveillance system – Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) – which will publicly broadcast aircrafts’ identity, position and other information.  That has raised security concerns among stakeholders, Reisman said in his paper, explaining that the ADS-B system “does not include provisions for maintaining these same aircraft-privacy options, nor does it address the potential for spoofing, denial of service, and other well-documented risk factors.”  Civil aircraft companies would prefer to keep some data private, he writes, for example, to counter tracking executives as part of corporate espionage operations.  Military aircraft traffic data, meanwhile, is defined by the Department of Defense as “Information that, if disclosed, would reveal vulnerabilities in the DoD critical infrastructure and, if exploited, would likely result in the significant disruption, destruction, or damage of or to DoD operations, property, or facilities.”  Considering the sensitivity of related air traffic data, the military need for confidentiality ""is likely to remain decisive in their adoption and use of ADS-B,"" Reisman writes.  To address these and other issues, the researcher presents a prototype in the paper, dubbed the Aviation Blockchain Infrastructure (ABI), based on Hyperledger Fabric and smart contracts, which allows control over what data is shared publicly or privately with authorized entities.  For instance, aircraft ""state information,"" such as altitude, indicated airspeed, heading, etc., could be kept secure via a private channel, while flight-plan information, such as aircraft type, origin, destination, filed route, etc., can be published on a public channel for access to approved members.  Reisman says:  “We propose to use a 'lightly permissioned' blockchain framework to enable the ADS-B systems to meet or exceed the same levels of privacy and security currently provided by radar-based systems in the NAS [National Airspace System].”  This is not the first time that the NASA has set out to explore blockchain seeking technological improvements. Back in February, the agency granted $330,000 to a professor at the University of Akron, to support research on ethereum blockchain technology to automatically detect floating debris.

42430120,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRL7h,1547197224,'0% Success': Why Blockchain Apps Just Aren’t Taking Off,"Yin Wu is the founder of Dirt Protocol, a protocol for decentralized information curation that aims to organize the world’s data and make it freely accessible.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  In 2018, the promise of a decentralized future fell apart.  The most widely used dapps have a few thousand daily users and a study of 43 blockchain applications found a zero percent success rate. With so much funding and talent in the space, why do we have so little success to show?  There is a broken process for building and launching blockchains applications today. Rather than working within an low-risk environment that supports iterations and learning, blockchain companies follow a playbook that stacks the odds against their success. By pre-selling a product before it is built, projects set themselves up to failure with unrealistically high user expectations on their V1.  Moving forward, this approach to building creates three problems:  To appease an early adopter crowd of crypto-enthusiasts, projects preach to the choir and build with the assumption that decentralization is the answer (rather than a means to an end)  With vocal supporters, projects make sub-optimal decisions by committee  With a market emphasis on ideas and theory, projects follow the white paper as if it is the final product plan rather than the starting point.  With so little to show from 2018, we have to change how products are incubated and tested. For a better 2019, we can take lessons from how successful technology companies are built and apply them to the blockchain space.  Build a product not a protocol  Many blockchain projects that pitched a future of decentralization just a year ago are realizing you cannot find mass market success by preaching a philosophy alone. Open-source projects as an alternative to closed, centralized networks are nothing new. It has been tried before with Diaspora vs Facebook, Mastodon vs Twitter and DuckDuckGo vs Google.  The takeaway from these projects is the same: openness and decentralization only matter to developers.  Blockchain applications need to go back to basics and ask the question of who is the user and what is their problem. Bitcoin created a way for darknet users to exchange funds online. Ethereum allows developers to run a script on a decentralized computer. IPFS is a way to store censorship data.  No crypto-economic incentive is strong enough to overcome a missing use-case.  Don’t let users tell you what to do  Facebook released the newsfeed to overwhelming negative public response. Apple product launches have all been met with the same media reaction: too expensive to succeed. Netflix moved to streaming and lost over a million customers in the transition.  Some of the most important product decisions that seem obvious in hindsight were controversial at the time. For crypto projects, a vocal community can be the biggest asset or biggest liability. Listen to your users but filter the feedback. Don’t give your users what they ask for; give them what they want.  Focus on iteration over the idea  There is an mistaken perception in crypto that the idea is the most important part of success. So, we see teams focusing on white papers and delaying the launch for years. But what we have learned from how successful technology startups are built is that a good idea is only the beginning.  Two markets with runaway success in 2018 were exchanges (e.g. Binance) and mining hardware (e.g. Bitmain). Binance went from zero to over $1 billion in revenue in under a year. ASIC mining efficiency for bitcoin has increased by over 10 times. In the same year, no decentralized application has seen mainstream success.  The product development cycle for building smart contracts and decentralized networks is excessively slow because the high risks of mistakes are too high (e.g. Parity wallet hacks). Rather than launching and learning from user feedback, teams iterate in isolation and delay the valuable learnings that come from real users. Moving forward, projects should launch earlier and smaller. Test the product with a small group of users, get feedback, and iterate.  Despite a 2018 with few signs of success, I am optimistic about the year ahead.  As seen in the dot-com bubble and burst, bear markets are some of the best times to collect talent and build. That said, as Einstein said, “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.""  So let’s shift to a new way of building in 2019.

42430114,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRKth,1547190030,Google Policy Change Forces Bitcoin Wallet to Remove Security Features,"The team behind Samourai, the privacy-focused bitcoin wallet, has removed a series of key security-related features from a version of its app as a result of “extremely restrictive policies” by Google.  Having released version 0.99.04 of its app Tuesday on the digital distribution service run by Google, called Google Play, Samourai explained in a blog post that three features – stealth mode, SIM switch defense, and remote SMS commands – have been removed as a result of Google’s push to “become more of a 'walled garden' experience.”  A version that contains those features is available, but not through Google's app service. Google did not respond to a request for comment.  ""Walled garden""  is a term synonymous with closed-platform or closed ecosystem, referring to a software system where the service provider takes on holistic control over all operations in the system including applications, content and media. However, this is not a new trend taken on by Google, but rather one that has been proliferating for years among big technology companies even outside of Google, including Facebook and Amazon.  Speaking to CoinDesk, co-founder of Samourai who goes by the pseudonym ""SW"" explained that the walled garden remark was in reference to a series of policy changes carried out over the last year by Google towards all Play store application developers.  ""Users of Samourai might have noticed that they are no longer getting notifications on when they receive bitcoin. That's because if you want to use notification services you have to route everything through Google services,"" said SW.  The accumulation of ""little things like that"" according to SW is pushing Samourai developers to opt-out of more features when releasing new wallet versions to the application.  What's more, SW is hopeful that a compromise can be drawn between Samourai and Google Play to reintroduce these features at a later date, saying:  ""If [Google] reached out to us, we'll be able to make arrangements and be able to figure out a way to keep these features. We're happy to change code on our end to keep in compliance with them.""  'A matter of life or death'  Indeed, after having been notified of Google's policy changes back in October, SW describes filing for an exemption to the rule changes immediately after highlighting in their request that ""for some of these users especially in South America, it is a matter of life or death.""  Stealth mode is a feature that cloaks the existence of a bitcoin wallet on a user's mobile device such that transactions can be made without detection in dangerous parts of the world. Remote SMS commands as highlighted by SW to CoinDesk ensures if a user's ""phone does get stolen, they can just send an SMS and wipe their wallet off of the phone securely.""  ""It's things like that that perhaps Google hasn't thought of because they're not thinking from the lens of a bitcoin wallet ... What I'm hoping for is that someone at Google will manually look at what we're doing here and say well actually they're trying to do this the right way,"" said SW.  And despite Google's rejection of Samourai's request for exemption, the company has released a temporary workaround for users still wanting to use these three features uploading to GitHub a feature complete version of the bitcoin wallet, dubbed version 0.99.03.  According to Samourai’s official Twitter account, this version is meant “to install over the Google Play version” and ensures users are “able to access wallet[s] as normal.”  But as highlighted by SW, installation from GitHub requires users to ""side-load"" the application by changing mobile device settings to ""install from unknown sources."" This is a potentially risky move for users who aren't used to manually screening third-party Google applications called Android Package Kits (APKs) for viruses or malicious software.  As SW explained:  ""Part of what [Google] is saying is that we're trying to make a safer experience for users but what they're actually doing is pushing users to side load APKs onto their devices which if they're not careful can install a malicious APK.""  Nevertheless, Google Play, according to co-founder SW, offers developers the ""greatest exposure"" and reach to users which being ""a very small team ... we need people to use the wallet to sustain ourselves.""  As such, the wallet-maker will continue to utilize the Play store platform as the application's sole distributor before a ""version 1.0"" is officially launched.  Until then, Samourai is encouraging users to request that Google Play ""rethink their rejection.""  ""I really do hope Google reconsiders,"" emphasized SW.

The New York City Economic Development Corporation's (EDC) new Blockchain Center opened Thursday, and intends to begin testing the tech's use cases next fall, Bloomberg reported Thursday. The center is part of a partnership with the venture capital fund Future\Perfect Ventures and the Global Blockchain Business Council trade organization.  It is unclear at this time which areas these use cases may cover. The EDC is a non-profit corporation which aims to support economic growth within the city. It acts as New York's official economic development corporation.  New York City itself has contributed $100,000 to the new Blockchain Center, and the facility will continue to raise funds through corporate partnerships and membership dues.  Microsoft Corporation and IBM have already partnered with the center, Future\Perfect Ventures managing partner Jalak Jobanputra told Bloomberg.  The new center, based in the Flatiron District, will offer classes on coding and host lectures aimed at both developers in the space and the general public.  The move comes as a number of crypto startups began laying off employees due to an ongoing bear market, but this is not necessarily a concern for the center.  Ana Arino, chief strategy officer with the EDC, told Bloomberg that the center was ""playing the long game,"" adding:  ""It’s a nascent technology, so there’s bound to be uncertainty around this evolution from year to year. While we don’t know what the future holds, we want to make sure we have a seat at the table shaping it.""  A number of companies are beginning to set up shop within New York, including Coinbase, which opened a new office in the city last fall. Canaan, a maker of bitcoin mining hardware, is also reportedly considering launching an initial public offering in the city.  The EDC did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

In a letter sent to investors late Thursday, tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi outlined the first steps toward taking custody of the tZERO security tokens. TZERO wrapped up the $134 million offering in August, and in October said that it had completed the issuance of the tokens, which were then locked up in a custodial wallet until January 10, as outlined in a press statement at the time.  ""As you are aware, on October 12, 2018 we completed the issuance of the tZERO security tokens. The tokens have been locked up in wallets maintained by tZERO on behalf of our token holders for 90 days following the issuance,"" Noursalehi wrote. ""Now that the three-month lock-up period has concluded, you must decide where to hold your security tokens.""  According to the letter, investors now have two options: create a brokerage account with broker-dealer and tZERO partner Dinosaur Financial Group or hold the tokens in a personal wallet, which is subject to a two-step verification process, according to tZERO.  “If you initially choose to hold your security tokens in your personal wallet, you may later move your tokens into a digital securities brokerage account you open up with Dinosaur,” the firm said.  What isn’t clear at this time is exactly when tZERO is expected to begin actual trading of the security token on its platform. In the letter, tZERO told investors to “look out for another tZERO update regarding the commencement of security token trading.”  Jonathan Johnson, the president of Medici Ventures – which oversees Overstock’s blockchain efforts, including tZERO – told CoinDesk last month that the security token platform will officially go live in January.
