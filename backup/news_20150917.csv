42426519,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtJDh,1442524012,CFTC Ruling Defines Bitcoin and Digital Currencies as Commodities,"The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has issued its first action against an unregistered bitcoin options trading platform, ordering the startup to cease operations and simultaneously settling the case.  The CFTC charged San Francisco-based startup Coinflip Inc, which does business under the name Derivabit, and CEO Francisco Riordan with conducting activity related to commodity options, without registering with the agency or meeting rules for exemption.  With the ruling, the CFTC has also confirmed that bitcoin and other digital currencies are commodities covered by the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). In the past, CFTC chairman Timothy Massad had stated that bitcoin was likely to be considered a commodity.  CFTC director of enforcement Aitan Goelman suggested in a statement that the agency will seek to hold digital currency companies to the same standards as more traditional businesses that fall under its purview.  Goelman said:  ""While there is a lot of excitement surrounding bitcoin and other virtual currencies, innovation does not excuse those acting in this space from following the same rules applicable to all participants in the commodity derivatives markets.""  More specifically, the CFTC found that Coinflip violated Section 4c of the CEA and Part 32 of the CFTC’s regulations, and that it should have registered as a swap execution facility or designated contract market. The agency also found that Riordan was liable for the violations.  Ending speculation  In its ruling, the CFTC offered clarity as to the ruling, stating that Section 1a(9) of the CEA defines commodity to include ""all services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.""  ""The definition of a 'commodity' is broad... Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are encompassed in the definition and properly defined as commodities,"" the agency wrote.  Speaking to CoinDesk, New York Law School professor Houman Shadab, who has authored works on the use of cryptographic technologies such as bitcoin for financial derivatives, went on to caution that the CFTC's oversight of the technology is limited to these applications.  However, he suggested the ruling may have larger implications.  ""The action puts to rest any notion that virtual currencies qualify as securities. Otherwise, the Securities and Exchange Comission would be bringing this action, not the CFTC,"" Shadab said.  For more of the agency's views on bitcoin and blockchain technology, revisit our full interview with former CFTC Commissioner Mark Wetjen.  The CFTC did not offer additional commentary on the announcement.  More details on the ruling can be found here.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/17/cftc-ruling-defines-bitcoin-and-digital-currencies-as-commodities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8f31df44f6f02ec56447f274cff72df5fca1b69-1500x800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426495,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtF1h,1442498589,ChangeTip Adds Dollar Tipping to Woo Non-Bitcoin Crowd,"Users of bitcoin tipping platform ChangeTip can now send tips in US dollars, a move aimed at capturing users who may be wary of digital currency.  Currently, ChangeTip's service – used across 12 social media platforms – denominates tips in bitcoin, or 'bits' (each worth 0.000001 of a bitcoin). However, in a statement today, the company said it is revamping its platform to support US dollar tips, a move that follows credit card support announced in July.  Nick Sullivan, founder and CEO of ChangeTip parent company ChangeCoin, said in a statement:  ""While electronic payments are well-established for online purchases, the concept of empowering everyone on the Internet to express gratitude and appreciation for great people, content, causes and contributions using the change in their digital pocket, is unique to social media tipping.""  In its release, ChangeTip cited survey results that indicate up to 76% of people won't use its service because of the digital currency. The remainder (24%) who do try it, it said, ""don't feel safe or confident"" sending it to friends. It did not disclose the methodology of its survey, nor its scale.  ""People believe it's not real money, that it's volatile, and that they won’t feel safe using it,"" the statement reads.  To counteract this, the firm expressed its belief that US dollar users could be introduced to bitcoin as they tip. The release continued:  ""When tips are sent internationally, we will be converting USD to bitcoin, showing people the benefits of it as a global currency. When people go to withdraw, they will see that bitcoin is far less expensive than USD to use on our platform as a form of value transfer.""  Users wishing to send dollar-denominated tips on the platform will need to first load their account with $25 via debit card. A further explanation of how users transact on the service can be found on Zendesk.  A search on the FinCEN database indicates the company has registered as a money transmitter in all US states, though it said regulatory challenges have been a barrier to its US dollar launch.  ""Being very transparent, we've been through some serious challenges to get USD to work. The regulatory and banking system challenges have been...an exercise in patience,"" it said.  Content monetization  Together with the announcement, ChangeTip also revealed it will launch a new product designed to support content creators.  While ChangeTip already offers a tipping widget available on blogging platforms such as WordPress, Tipworthyhttps://www.changetip.com/tipworthy aims to be a content curation offering where users can post links to content they believe warrants additional compensation.  In statements, the company likened the product to social media giant Pinterest.  Users are then prompted to tip in denominations of $0.25, $1, $2, $5 and $10. The company said it will also seek to reward users who post content, though no details on this initiative were provided.  ChangeTip did not indicate whether tips to the service would be sent to the content creators or the publishing media outlet.  Bridges to bitcoin  In its public messaging, ChangeTip sought to emphasize to existing bitcoin users that the new feature was not intended to move the company away from the technology.  Rather, the startup framed the transition as one that would perhaps help it better attack ""consumer perception problems"" bitcoin and digital currencies still face.  ChangeTip indicated it is currently working on a ""decentralized"" version of its platform, where users are in control of funds. Currently, ChangeTip processes all bitcoin transactions off of the main bitcoin blockchain.  ""We are moving small amounts of money, it's not feasible to have a 1/10th of a penny tip or micropayment to a publisher be an on-chain transaction,"" the company said.  Proposals are currently being considered by the company regarding how it could leverage payment channels on the proposed Lightning Network and other alternatives to further its support for bitcoin.  The company said it is also working on plans that would allow it to circumvent the traditional banking system, while still offering its full suite of current services.  The company did not immediately respond to comment on this story, though it said CEO Nick Sullivan would seek to answer community questions on Reddit starting at 10:00 EST, 15:00 BST.

German Greft, the former Minister of Economic Development and Trade of the Russian Federation made the comment at Finnopolis 2015 – a FinTech conference – and noted how he had also fallen victim to the digital currency's volatility.  Speaking at the event, Gref said:  ""I am one of the victims, I have a small amount of bitcoins ... Only one currency in the world has devalued more than the ruble – bitcoin.""  His comments come after Russian financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev reportedly described Moscow-based payment firm QIWI's upcoming plans to create a bitcoin-based currency that would essentially be a virtual version of the ruble as illegal.  Speaking during a radio broadcast, Medvedev noted that Russia's Central Bank was, according to the constitution, the only entity allowed to issue money in the country.  Although now a corporate senior officer at Sberbank – where the Russian government holds the majority of shares – Gref has a notable history in public office, during which he also held the position of first deputy minister of state property of the Russian Federation.

42426486,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtEph,1442486238,"PEY Gets €300,000 in Seed Funding for Bitcoin Payroll Service","Bitcoin payment startup PEY has raised €300,000 ($339,780) in seed funding for a new payroll service.  The Hanover-based firm, which makes bitcoin point-of-sale (POS) terminals alongside a consumer app, attracted investment from a series of entrepreneurs, including the former managing director of multinational e-commerce company Zalando, Frank Biedka.  Ricardo Ferrer Rivero, founder and managing director at PEY, told CoinDesk:  ""The new funding will be used to hire developers, pay lawyers for everything necessary to make in-depth checks on what we are offering to customers and to ensure that we find legal workarounds that help expand bitcoin adoption.""  PEY will be launching the payroll solution this autumn, enabling companies in Germany – where the cryptocurrency is considered to be a financial instrument – to pay a portion of their employees' salaries in the digital currency.  ""Currently we are using the fact that in Germany bitcoin is not considered a currency. Our lawyers and advisors helped us get legal and tax approval to do this correctly. We will be offering that for now only in Germany but we want to find similar workarounds in every country we enter,"" Rivero said.  Point of Sale  According to its founder, the startup – which gave away some of its POS terminals to merchants in Germany for free earlier this year – is also hoping for its devices to expand internationally.  ""We have had a great reception to the terminals ... We also had a lot of people from around the world asking us how they could order them. We have put them all on a waiting list and will notify them as soon as we roll out internationally.""  Despite PEY's recent venture, the startup does not yet have a revenue model. This decision, the founder claims, is attributed to the company's focus on offering value to both merchants and users.  ""If we have enough happy people and companies on both sides, we are sure that we will find a way to earn money. When the time comes, we will start thinking of what is the best way of achieving this,"" he concluded.

42426477,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJtEZh,1442461897,BitPay Sues Insurer After Losing $1.8 Million in Phishing Attack,"UPDATE (17th September 15:25 BST): This piece has been updated with additional information, including the court documents filed by BitPay in federal court.      BitPay has filed suit against a Massachusetts insurance company after losing $1.8m during a phishing attack last December.  According to documents obtained by the Atlanta Business Chronicle, the bitcoin payment processor was defrauded in mid-December by an unknown individual posing as BTC Media CEO David Bailey, whose computer was infiltrated prior to the attack.  The attacker subsequently obtained email credentials for BitPay CFO Bryan Krohn, which were then used to prompt CEO Stephen Pair and executive chairman Tony Gallippi to authorize three payments totalling 5,000 BTC on 11th and 12th December, including one transaction from a wallet on the bitcoin exchange Bitstamp.  BitPay filed a claim for the losses days after the event with Massachusetts Bay Insurance Company, which later denied the claim in a letter dated 8th June. BitPay’s legal representation disputed the rejection, and the insurer went on to reaffirm its decision the following month.  After demanding that its claim be honored, BitPay filed suit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on 15th September. The company alleged breach of contract and is seeking damages and court fees in addition to its $950,000 claim.  The attack demonstrates the risk companies handling digital currencies face from such attacks, as well as the cost of fraud resulting from the failure of operational policies to prevent such intrusions.  Attack timeline  Court documents from the trial, including the complaint and the letters exchanged between BitPay and Massachusetts Bay’s lawyers, outline how the assailant, pretending to be Bailey, initiated the attack by sending by email containing a link to a Google document.  Bailey’s computer had been compromised prior to this, though no details regarding this incident are mentioned.  The complaint states:  ""The phony email sent by the person who hacked Mr Bailey’s computer, directed Mr Krohn to a website controlled by the hacker wherein Mr Krohn provided the credentials for his BitPay corporate email account. After capturing Mr Krohn's BitPay credentials, the hacker used that information to hack into Mr Krohn's BitPay email account to fraudulently cause a transfer of bitcoin.""  A timeline included in Massachusetts Bay’s initial denial letter goes into further detail.  ""Immediately after clicking on the Google doc link, Mr Krohn enters his authenticating information as prompted in order to access the purported Google docs and receives an error message,"" the letter states. ""[Krohn] believes his private information was stolen at that time and that his response provided access to his email to the fraudster.""  A key detail included in the emails was now accessible to the fraudster: the fact that BitPay did not require SecondMarket to advance pay for bitcoins it received from the company.  Using this information, the individual crafted an email chain showing a conversation between Krohn and SecondMarket vice president Preston Blankenship regarding a purchase of 1,000 BTC.  ""The email requests that 1,000 bitcoins be transferred to SecondMarket at a specific wallet address provided. At 3:33 PM the bitcoins are sent from BitPay's hot wallet,"" Massachusetts Bay’s letter stated.  Less than an hour later, the individual controlling Krohn’s email requested an additional 1,000 BTC be sent to the same bitcoin address. This amount was then transferred from an account held on Bitstamp by Gallippi after Pair indicated by email that there were insufficient funds in BitPay's ""warm"" wallet following the second request.  The next day, Krohn’s email was used to request that Pair send an additional 3,000 BTC to another address said to be controlled by SecondMarket.  Pair responded ""to confirm that this request, which exceeded the usual 1000-2000 daily bitcoin amount between the companies, was valid"". The assailant responded by copying an email address purportedly from SecondMarket and confirming that the request was valid.  After processing the transaction, Pair confirmed the move by email and copied SecondMarket employee Gina Guarnaccia.  Guarnaccia wrote back ""that she did not send the prior email noting the 3,000 bitcoins and address for them to be sent, and that SecondMarket did not purchase the bitcoins"".  Claims dispute emerges  Following an investigation, BitPay's claim was rejected by the insurer. Massachusetts Bay argued in its rejection letter that BitPay incurred an indirect loss rather than a direct one, thereby excluding the incident from coverage.  The letter stated:  “The facts as presented do not support a direct loss since there was not a hacking or unauthorized entry into BitPay's computer system fraudulently causing a transfer of money. Instead, the computer system of David Bailey, BitPay's business partner, was compromised resulting in fictitious emails being received by BitPay.""  ""The Policy does not afford coverage for indirect losses caused by a hacking into the computer system of someone other than the insured,"" the letter added.  Further, the insurance company argued that because bitcoins exist in an electronic medium, any incident resulting in their loss wouldn't be considered as taking place on BitPay’s ""premises"".  ""It is Hanover's understanding that the bitcoins were held online, and transferred online, and are not on the physical premises of BitPay. It does not appear that the bitcoin transactions involved a transfer of property from inside the premises to outside the premises,"" the insurer wrote. ""As such, Hanover must respectfully decline to provide coverage for this loss under the Computer Fraud Insuring Agreement.""  A week later, Morris, Manning & Martin LLP, a law firm representing BitPay, responded by demanding that the insurer rescind its claim rejection and pay the requested $950,000.  BitPay disputed the assertion that its losses were indirect, positing that Massachusetts Bay was misinterpreting its own policy provision regarding computer fraud. The company further stated that, per its agreement with the insurer, its bitcoin holdings were subject to special consideration given the particulars of the digital currency.  “MBIC agreed to add bitcoin to the Policy definition of 'money' thereby insuring BitPay against loss of bitcoin. Unlike traditional money, bitcoin does not exist in physical form in any location or premises, and it cannot be transferred from or to any physical location,"" attorney Jessica Pardi wrote in the letter.  ""Accordingly, any agreement to insure bitcoin that purportedly requires bitcoin to be on BitPay's premises is illusory, and MBIC's interpretation is meritless and evidences bad faith,"" she added.  In a response letter sent by law firmer Leo & Weber, the insurer reaffirmed its refusal to honor the claim and disputed BitPay’s counterarguments about the losses being direct rather than indirect.  ""We are unaware of any evidence to support that the perpetrator gained access to the BitPay computer system or device. The ultimate transfer of bitcoins did not result from the perpetrator's access to the BitPay computer system or device,"" the letter stated. ""Ultimately, Mr Krohn's superiors made the decision to send bitcoins in three separate transactions, prior to receiving payment, to whom they believed was SecondMarket.”  Days later, BitPay reiterated its demands and threatened to sue if it wasn't paid. The insurer refused to accept the claim or pay the requested amount, according to the complaint.  BitPay and Massachusetts Bay did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
