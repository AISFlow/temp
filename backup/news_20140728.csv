42425946,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhBvh,1406585420,Tim Draper Leads CrowdCurity's $1 Million Seed Funding,"Crowdsourced IT security startup CrowdCurity has raised $1m in seed funding as part of a new investment round led by high-profile bitcoin investor Tim Draper and Kima Ventures.  Notably, part of the investment provided by Cryptonaut Ventures was made directly with bitcoin and settled into USD using bitcoin exchange services provided by Vaurum – a CrowdCurity client and graduate of Boost VC’s incubator program.  Sophos Chief Technology Officer Gerhard Eschelbeck, Cyphort cofounder Dr Fengmin Gong and Mountain View-­based incubator 500 Startups were also among the round’s strategic investors.  CrowdCurity CEO Jacob Hansen framed the announcement as one that validates his company's novel approach to web security, saying:  “We are tired of security being something for enterprises and consultants in grey suits. It’s time to put some Web 2.0 into security, and show the people on the other end.”  The company will use the investment to expand its crowdsourced security marketplace and continue to democratize it, making it affordable and accessible to all businesses, not just large corporations with big security budgets.  Bitcoin-friendly business  CrowdCurity is a first-of-its-kind platform that connects businesses with vetted security researchers through bug bounty programs.  It currently performs security testing for major bitcoin companies such as Vaurum, Vault of Satoshi, Blockchain and BitGo, and has seen an increasing amount of adoption from other digital currency businesses – about 50 to date, according to Hansen.  So far, CrowdCurity has enrolled 1,200 security researchers and has completed 90 bug bounty programs.  Security researchers go through a vetting process with know your customer (KYC) protocols. CrowdCurity pays them in bitcoin, and clients pay CrowdCurity with bitcoin or credit card.  Draper's latest move  Although the round includes a number of significant investors, none is perhaps more visible in the bitcoin ecosystem than Tim Draper.  The winner of the recent US Marshals auction of 30,000 BTC, Draper is also the father of industry venture capitalist and founder of Boost VC Adam Draper, of which CrowdCurity’s founding members Esben Friis­-Jensen, Christian Hansen, Jacob Hansen and Jakob Storm are alums.  Tim Draper began publicly supporting bitcoin last year following the announcement that his Silicon Valley university, Draper University of Heroes, would accept bitcoin. Draper has since backed bitcoin startups Vaurum and BitPagos, and mentors Boost VC which has pledged to fund 100 bitcoin startup companies over the next three years.

42425949,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhC3h,1406571612,Atlas ATS Expands Institutional Bitcoin Exchange to European Market,"New York-based bitcoin exchange services provider Atlas ATS has announced the launch of its latest international offering, Atlas ATS Europe.  The product of a partnership with Spain-based bitcoin ATM network and exchange specialist Recol Pro S.A., the launch follows the announcement of Atlas ATS's Asian market entrance this July. That initiative found Atlas ATS partnering with China-based bitcoin ATM manufacturer BitOcean for a new, yet-to-be launched venture called BitOcean Japan.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Atlas ATS CEO Shawn Sloves and chief marketing and communications officer Rafi Reguer indicated that the European expansion is simply the latest example of the 'global-local model' that the exchange is seeking to leverage to expand internationally.  Reguer explained that Atlas has been seeking to partner with experienced local operators in a number of high-interest markets in a bid to ensure regulatory compliance for consumers, saying:  ""One of the things that distinguishes Atlas is the idea of embracing regulation and trying to get regulated. For the vast majority of individual investors and institutions out there, if digital currency is going to be a real thing that they invest in, it's got to be on a platform that's similar to the existing equities and futures exchanges, all of the bells and whistles that come with that, with all the audit-ability and technology.""  It's this commitment to the design of its offering and its unique plan for scaling its business that has won praise from top industry analysts such as Wedbush partner Gil Luria.  Luria told Institutional Investor in June that he believes Atlas to be the frontrunner at creating a world-class trading platform, ahead of even existing market heavyweights such as SecondMarket and Kraken.  Three-pronged market approach  Atlas ATS Europe will offer three key components that the firm believes will make it initially attractive to local bitcoin traders – a trading platform, a multi-signature digital wallet, and a bitcoin ATM network.  Ignacio Ozcariz, CEO of Recol, said that the partnership also represents a deeper commitment to the space on behalf of his firm, which has historically specialized in telecommunications and IT offerings, saying:  “Recol is positioning itself to be a global operator in the bitcoin ecosystem and Atlas ATS Europe is a key part of that strategy.""  ATM access will be limited to Spain at launch. However, Recol has promised to expand its network dramatically following the partnership.  Atlas ATS Europe will link to the company's US order book in order to provide a deeper pool of initial liquidity, and European and US customers will now be able to buy and sell bitcoin in either US dollars or euros.  Global expansion continues  Speaking to CoinDesk, Sloves indicated that Atlas is currently seeking to expand its exchange through more partnerships around the globe, and that a new offering in Dubai could be the next to launch.  Sloves said that, by working with local operators, Atlas is able to expand its offerings in a legally compliant way, a practice that he feels best positions Atlas for long-term market impact. He explained that in Asia, for instance, it sought to work in Hong Kong and Singapore before settling on Japan, highlighting some of the unique considerations his firm made in this market.  Sloves said:  ""In Singapore, we were developing local registration for AML and KYC, but the one thing that we look for in a country is partnerships. In Singapore, you need a local operator, someone who has a national ID card and can file a corporation. [...] In other countries, we set up banking relationships. We're going to have local operators to handle local law and local compliance.""  By building strong relationships on each continent, Atlas ATS aims to bring all the pieces together for a global bitcoin exchange with enough liquidity to attract institutional investors.  Hinting at future plans, Sloves further said: ""We're also launching Africa, where we're working with another partner firm, and eventually South America.""  Drinking the Kool-Aid  Having worked in the financial industry since the early 1990s, Sloves held positions as a capital markets specialist and co-founded multi-asset trading technology firm Fundamental Interactions in 2011.  After developing an interest in bitcoin, Sloves attended the Bitcoin2013 conference in San Jose and decided to leverage Fundamental Interactions' technology to launch a digital currency exchange:  ""We had a built matching engine for Wall Street firms, so we figured, we're trading bitcoin, we're spending millions of dollars on this, why don't we apply it to digital currency?""  The move was more than savvy business, however, as Sloves also stressed the passion that his firm has for the project:  ""One thing that makes us a little different, we believe in digital currency, we want to support it, increase usership, price stability, that's our main objective. First and foremost, we drank the Kool-Aid, we believe the whole protocol and how it's going to change everything. That's what gets us up everyday in doing this stuff.""  Atlas ATS officially launched in March of this year, but has been offering private markets trading since late 2013.

42425945,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhBth,1406569225,Moolah Acquires Troubled Altcoin Exchange MintPal,"Moopay LTD, the digital currency service provider more commonly known as Moolah, has purchased MintPal, the altcoin exchange which recently suffered from a severe hack that compromised nearly $2m in customer funds.  With the acquisition, Moopay said it plans to use Mintpal as its primary altcoin trading platform. Moolah.io already operates the digital currency exchange Prelude, a subservice of Moopay that focuses on dogecoin and bitcoin.  Alex Green  , CEO of Moopay, stated that he believes MintPal will benefit from Moopay's significant development and security expertise, and that the resulting merger will restore confidence in the exchange, which has seen falling volumes since the hack.  Green told CoinDesk:  ""We were attracted to the deal by a few simple reasons. MintPal has one of the best [user interfaces] in the industry, a solid user base and a strong customer following. We believed that we were in the best position in terms of security, operational and performance expertise in order to take the exchange to the next level.""  Moopay suggested that its Prelude exchange offering would soon focus only on fiat markets, while MintPal would offer altcoin-to-altcoin trading. Moopay will gradually take over the exchange's operations, with the transition taking place through the month of August.  Moopay was previously the center of controversy in May, when then prominent members of the dogecoin community raised concerns about its operations. However, the allegations were vocally denounced by both Moopay and Green.  Planned improvements  Moopay indicated that it has a number of security and performance enhancements planned for MintPal, which will roll out over the next few months, though no specific dates were given.  Specifically, Moopay said MintPal would benefit from its 24/7 customer support team, its third-party review system and high-speed desktop-based trading applications.  Moopay said in a statement:  ""MintPal will continue in the interim as a standalone exchange, with a view to sharing logins between the two platforms in the near future.""  Notably, the hacking attack against MintPal, while compromising 8 million vericoins (VRC), was not able to successfully affect the exchange's bitcoin or litecoin wallets. The exchange's cold storage procedures were ultimately deemed at fault for the vericoin loss, which necessitated a significant developer effort to counteract.  About MintPal  Launched in February, MintPal gained popularity among altcoin traders due to its modern website and strong product offering.  MintPal boasts support for a wide range of altcoins including more mainstream offerings such as dogecoin and litecoin alongside more obscure options such as noblecoin and potcoin.

42425940,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhBnh,1406566590,"SWIFT Institute Offers €15,000 for Bitcoin Research Project","The SWIFT Institute has announced it is launching a new research programme on digital currencies, with a €15,000 grant on offer for the author of the winning proposal.  The institute is looking for research on recent developments in digital currencies and cryptocurrencies, but places an emphasis on bitcoin, which it describes as ""arguably the most popular"" digital currency.  ""With bitcoin’s increasing usage, virtual currencies are becoming more of a reality. There are bitcoin ATMs in more than 10 countries worldwide, and the currency is increasingly accepted by mainstream retailers,"" the SWIFT Institute says, in a call for proposals titled, 'Virtual Currencies: What are the “real” risks?’.  Peter Ware, director of the SWIFT Institute told CoinDesk:  ""It is a very topical area impacting the global financial industry and the world in general, and one that is increasingly discussed at conferences, in the media, at the central bank level, etc. For many people, however, it is not a topic that is fully understood. Through academic research, the SWIFT Institute is aiming to provide some concrete input to the discussion.""  Risks and advantages  In an overview of the subject, the institute points out that there are an average of 40,000-80,000 bitcoin transactions per day, adding that the volume is ""expected to rise exponentially"" as the currency gains acceptance.  The institute outlines a number of potential potential advantages and challenges associated with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that the research proposals will need to address:  What is the net economic impact of virtual currencies?  Do the lower transaction costs outweigh resources expended in mining?  What is the relationship between virtual currencies and real money?  How can banks and virtual currencies cooperate?  What are the risks involved in using virtual currencies?  What role can or should regulators and central banks play?  What are the potential impacts of distributed ledger technologies?  Would pegging/fixing exchange rates help stabilise virtual currencies?  How can criminal activity be avoided when using digital currencies?  The document also adds that the research proposals can be either theoretical or empirical in nature.  How to submit a proposal  The institute requires all applicants to submit a CV or biography with all relevant information about the applicant, who is also required to submit a 2,500 word description of the research project. The deadline is August 20th 2014. The SWIFT institute told CoinDesk that it currently has a handful of proposals, but the institute typically receives proposals very close to the deadline.  The winning author will receive 50% of the grant immediately, while the remaining 50% will be paid out when the working paper is submitted.  Once the research is completed, the SWIFT Institute will make it available to the financial industry and it will be freely available to anyone who wishes to download it.  The SWIFT Institute is an offshoot of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which effectively sets the standards for interbank digital transactions and currently works with more than 10,500 banks and other banking organisations.  The institute was founded in 2012 with the goal of researching the current operations and future needs of the global financial services system. Part of its job is to award grants to attract more academics to tackle industry challenges and explore new ideas.

42425956,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhCDh,1406563858,"BTC China Upgrades Mobile App with New Trading Pairs, Live Charts","BTC China has upgraded its mobile app, saying it is the first Chinese exchange to allow users to trade in three trading pairs: BTC/CNY, LTC/CNY, and LTC/BTC.  The app, 'Mobile Exchange 2.0', is cross-platform and HTML5 based, running in mobile browsers. It now also offers streaming real-time market data and candlestick charts for the aforementioned currencies, giving traders the ability to monitor market trends anytime and anywhere.  BTC China  is charging 0% trading fees on its web and mobile platforms, with a 0.38% withdrawal fee being its only charge. Users may still have to pay third-party bank fees to transfer funds into their accounts, however.  Mobile Exchange availability and features  The upgraded app now includes some more familiar smartphone and tablet gestures such as 'swipe to edit' and 'swipe to cancel', plus other features that allow traders to respond quickly to price movements with minimal navigation. Furthermore, Mobile Exchange 2.0 is available in 10 languages.  Aimed more at traders, it is a separate entity to the 'Picasso' app, which BTC China calls its 'wallet and mobile ATM'. Picasso allows everyday users to track prices and set their own commissions to trade bitcoin face to face.  Litecoin trading and value  BTC China introduced litecoin trading in March this year. The world's second-most-popular cryptocurrency, which was the invention of CEO Bobby Lee's brother Charles, is now traded on several exchanges, but has suffered a price slump lately.  Once tied closely to the price fortunes of bitcoin, litecoin has gone from a high of around $48 at the same time bitcoin reached its zenith in late 2013 to around $7.47 on both BTC China and BTC-e today.  The altcoin's supporters say litecoin's peaks and troughs are merely a normal part of a cryptocurrency's lifecycle, and point out that its fortunes are still connected to bitcoin's. Charles Lee himself has described litecoin as being ""still in the speculator stage"" of its development.  About BTC China  BTC China, which claims to be the world's oldest bitcoin exchange, also recently added USD and HKD deposits and withdrawals to its platform as part of its ""plans for aggressive international expansion"". At the time of bitcoin's December peak, it was China's most popular exchange.  At present, the majority of BTC China's users are still located in Beijing and Shanghai, although the company said they expect the number of users from other regions to increase significantly soon.

Under the terms of the deal, Bits of Proof CEO Tamás Blummer will join CoinTerra, assuming the position of Vice President of Enterprise Software, while CoinTerra will gain access to BOP assets, including its 'enterprise-ready' implementation of the bitcoin protocol.  Bits of Proof (BOP) is a Hungarian software firm that builds business-focused solutions based on block-chain technology. Last year the company launched the BOP Enterprise Bitcoin Server, which it dubbed the 'Red Hat for Bitcoin'.  The BOP protocol has already been used to develop BopShop, a merchant payment processor for online retailers and traditional brick-and-mortar shops. The protocol was also used to develop real-time auditable exchange Bullion Bitcoin and the TREZOR hardware bitcoin wallet.  Piece of the enterprise mining puzzle  CoinTerra says Bits of Proof's modern and modular implementation of the bitcoin protocol will provide its TruePeta architecture with unparalleled reliability, performance and scalability for large-scale bitcoin mining operations.  “By acquiring Bits of Proof, CoinTerra gains enterprise software expertise and solutions that complement our expertise in hardware development and significantly strengthen our offering,” said Ravi Iyengar, CEO of CoinTerra.  “The software solutions developed by Bits of Proof and the expertise of Tamás Blummer represent an important piece of the enterprise mining puzzle that will allow us to grow our operations quickly and [securely] at peak efficiency.”  “With CoinTerra, the Bits of Proof software stack is sure to become the industry standard software stack for bitcoin in enterprises,” said Blummer.  What does this mean for existing BOP products?  The announcement does not shed light on how the news might affect BOP's existing products and services. The company currently offers BopShop, myTREZOR server and Bullion Bitcoin products. The firm says it has other projects in the pipeline and believes the bitcoin network will cause fundamental changes in the way financial services operate.  Prior to the acquisition, Bits of Proof was an independent, self-funded company based in Budapest, headed by financial services veterans such as Blummer. It remains to be seen what CoinTerra plans to do with the BOP software stack and ongoing development projects.

42425955,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhCBh,1406554241,Blockchain Returns to Apple iOS with New Bitcoin Wallet,"UPDATE (30th July 11:44 BST): Users have reported a bug in the denomination functionality on Blockchain's iOS app whereby orders are being billed in 'bits’ – also known as 'uBTC' – rather than 'BTC'. For example, a user buying an item would click the 'Pay with Bitcoin' link, but their wallet (configured to display in 'bits') would send .0843 bits instead of .0843 BTC. CEO Nic Cary says a fix will be implemented in the app's next update ""imminently"".      Following Apple's controversial removal of iOS bitcoin apps in January, the first of the big-name wallets relaunches on the App Store today.  Blockchain  , which already provides hugely popular wallets for both desktop computers and Android devices, has unveiled its new-from-the-ground-up iOS wallet, which it hopes will bring bitcoin to users across the globe.  Prior to Apple’s removal of all apps offering cryptocurrency transactions in January 2014, Blockchain was the most downloaded bitcoin wallet for iOS devices.  Controversial ban  Blockchain's announcement will likely come as welcome news for the bitcoin community, which protested loudly at Apple's ban – with some users even shooting their iPhones in an unlikely show of support.  However, for reasons known only to Apple insiders, a new, more open policy was announced at the Worldwide Developer’s Conference in early June, paving the way once more for bitcoin wallets and other apps that transact using cryptocurrencies.  In the weeks since then, the App Store has seen the addition of several bitcoin apps, including an unofficial wallet for Coinbase users and Gliph, a messaging service that lets connected users send each other bitcoin. However, Blockchain is the first of the major players to offer wallet services on iOS since early 2014.  Nicolas Cary, CEO of Blockchain, told CoinDesk:  “The moment Apple signalled a shift in their policy toward digital currency apps, we pulled the iOS project off the shelf and got to work. We wanted to use this as an opportunity to improve the wallet, but we were still apprehensive about dedicating huge amounts of engineering time because it wasn't clear what types of apps would get through the submission and approval process.”  He added: “Working with Apple has been quick and easy, and we really appreciate their thoughtful guidance – it's a partnership we really value.”  The new app  As well as exchanging bitcoin between wallets, Blockchain's app also allows iPhone and iPad users to make purchases from the fast-growing number of merchants that accept bitcoin – both online and in physical outlets.  That list has this year expanded to include major retailers such as Overstock, DISH, Expedia and, most recently, Dell (for more, see our guide to bitcoin-accepting merchants).  Cary said that Blockchain has rebuilt its wallet app from scratch to improve security, enhance performance, and introduce a new user experience. He explained:  “The app strikes a strong balance between functionality and security. At Blockchain, we always believe in putting users firmly in control of their funds and that hasn't changed with the new iOS wallet. You'll also find a new security PIN screen and we have updated the default miners' fee when sending transactions.  New features coming  Cary told CoinDesk that the new wallet for iOS will be available for users to download from the App Store today, adding:  “We invite bitcoin enthusiasts everywhere to give it a try. We're looking forward to adding exciting new functionality going forward, including the very popular Merchant Map from our Android Wallet. Stay tuned for lots of updates.”  He further explained that the return to Apple iOS is “hugely important for bitcoin in general and very exciting for Blockchain”. The release of the app means that the millions of iOS users around the world will now have the opportunity to experience bitcoin first-hand, Cary indicated, adding:  “Furthermore, this confirms that Apple is welcoming back the development community to invest, build, and create bitcoin apps again.”  Blockchain is currently the most popular bitcoin wallet in the world with over 1.9 million users. Its website, Blockchain.info, also hosts bitcoin charts, currency statistics, and a block-chain explorer.

42425938,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIhBjh,1406542946,California Lawyer is Latest Congressional Candidate to Accept Bitcoin,"Christina Gagnier is the latest US congressional candidate to accept campaign donations in bitcoin.  The Democrat representing California’s 35th congressional district is a business owner and lawyer who specializes in technology and, more specifically, the Internet.  Gagnier said that several of her constituents had asked if she would begin accepting bitcoin donations, and when guidance issued by the Federal Elections Committee (FEC) in May allowed her to, she embraced the idea.  She told CoinDesk:  “My campaign is particularly focused on meeting voters where they are at, whether that’s showing up on their doorstep to see how I can help or accepting a currency like bitcoin as a way to engage someone in the campaign.”  Gagnier has partnered with Coinbase to begin the initiative.  Innovation vs regulation  Gagnier acknowledged that politicians who speak publicly about their positive experiences with digital currencies could help bring them further into the mainstream. In addition, she continued, Congress needs representatives who bring technological fluency to the country’s regulatory body.  “Technology impacts and will impact every single industry,” she said, citing the recurring theme in bitcoin’s development that technology outpaces the law. “Having a Congress comprised of individuals from a variety of the backgrounds is the way that we get regulation that makes sense and is practical for various industries.”  Gagnier is a founding partner of the tech-focused legal firm Gagnier Margossian LLPhttp://www.gamallp.com/. She is also the CEO and founder of JobScout, an online platform where job seekers can learn job-hunting skills.  She said that she wants to see digital currency help the growth of small businesses that operate on- and offline, but that there needs to be more guidance and clarity on the subject:  “When each state has their own set of laws dealing with money transmission and now some states seek to independently regulate bitcoin, it can be really confusing to someone who wants to accept or transact with bitcoin. Some federal guidance and a cohesive legal framework would be extremely helpful.”  For example, she said, California’s bill to make bitcoin “lawful money” doesn’t provide regulations “for the issuance and circulation of bitcoin, but it is a good first step to see how these types of currencies can actually work to benefit our local economy”.  The new election environment  Gagnier is one of several US politicians that have publicly embraced bitcoin, and one of a handful accepting online campaign donations in bitcoin.  In light of the increasing public support, the FEC’s new guidance on campaign donations and the forthcoming midterm elections, BitPay recently announced several new partnerships to help political campaigns take advantage of the circumstances.  The payments processor joined with CoinVox, an organization that advises political campaigns on bitcoin compliance, as well as NGP VAN and Targeted Victory, who offer political campaigns assistance.  Gagnier’s campaign is focused on innovation and new ideas to spur economic growth in her district, she said.  California’s 35th congressional district includes Chino, Ontario, Pomona, Montclair, Fontana, Rialto and Bloomington. It is part of the Inland Empire region of the state and sits within both Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.
