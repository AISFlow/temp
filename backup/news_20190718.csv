""Blockchain and crypto have captured the imagination of many,"" she said. ""In fact right before this I was just over at the International Chamber of Commerce meeting with the secretary-general and hearing what they're planning with blockchain and potentially crypto.

""It's an exciting area. It's something people are interested in,"" she said.  Klayman also see's Facebook's decision to headquarter in Switzerland as another positive. Switzerland, she said, is ahead of the curve in terms of regulation.

42403088,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdedDK,1563489329,Consumer Advocates Urge Libra Members to Quit Facebook Crypto,"A coalition of consumer advocacy groups has urged the 28 member companies of the Libra Association to quit the Facebook-led cryptocurrency project en masse.  ""We call upon you as respected members of the business, financial, technology, and civil society communities to collectively withdraw from the Libra project,"" says the open letter signed by Open Markets Institute, Public Citizen, Revolving Door Project, and Demand Progress Education Fund.  While the advocates said they agree with the Geneva-based consortium's purported aim to extend financial services to the 1.7 billion global underbanked, they cautioned:  ""Achieving a laudable goal should not be cheapened with a project whose aims are in fact unclear and whose leadership structure is based on fear.""  The alleged ""fear"" they refer to stems from Facebook's clout, given the social network's vast userbase. The letter quotes Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), who said during Tuesday's Senate Banking Committee hearing:  “Members of the consortium actually have lots of questions too, similar to the questions that are being offered on this dais and they have great reservations about moving forward but they don't want to be left out because of Facebook's market power.”  Don't fear the Libra  The advocates implored Libra's members (which include Visa, MasterCard, Paypal and Uber) not to be cowed by their ringleader, saying:  “We understand that Facebook is a powerful company, and that it has in part generated a climate of fear with its market dominance. But if you collectively withdraw from the project, it will signal that the just-beginning era of digital money will be based on fair rules and democratic deliberation, and not intimidation by the powerful.”  The groups also cite Libra’s “potential to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, bank runs, systemic risk, evasion of sanctions, and anti-competitive activity” as reasons to ditch it.  Among the letter's four signatories, Public Citizen has been particularly vocal in opposition to Facebook's plans to launch a global currency.  Its president, Robert Weissman, called Libra a ""cartel"" in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday, and the group earlier called on Congress to halt the project.

42430740,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxTnh,1563487825,Privacy Cryptocurrency Zcash Prepares for 'Friendly' Fork,"In about five hours, the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Zcash will spawn a new blockchain network called Ycash.  It’ll be the first of its kind to boast a near-identical codebase to the Zcash blockchain but function as a separate network and de facto competitor.  First announced in April, the effort is spearheaded by long-time Zcash supporter Howard Loo. Loo described in a Zcash forum post that Ycash was a preemptive move to resist future community decisions that may extend Zcash's system of developer funding known as the ""Founder's Reward"" beyond a promised 10 percent cap of total token supply.  ""We are also launching Ycash to uphold a promise – that the Zcash Founders Reward would be forever capped at 2.1 million coins – that we fear will come under increasing pressure between now and the expiration of the Founders Reward in October 2020,"" Loo wrote in the forum post.  Since then, prominent leaders in the Zcash community such as founder of the coin Zooko Wilcox have publicly expressed their support of Loo's initiative, agreeing to disagree on certain network changes to the Founder's Reward and others that will make Ycash backwards-incompatible to Zcash.  Normally, network splits of this nature actually add value to a user’s cryptocurrency holdings. This is because users are able to redeem the exact same amount of coins minted on one blockchain on the new blockchain, free of cost.  “From a speculator’s standpoint, network splits often present an intriguing investment opportunity,” said former CoinDesk markets analyst and current crypto trader Sam Ouimet. “New money often buys up the cryptocurrency being forked in order to secure his/her claims of the new coins.”  Of course, the value of these newly issued coins, called YECs, on the Ycash network may be significantly lower than ZECs on the Zcash network. However, if past blockchain forks that have spawned spin-off cryptocurrencies are any indicator, coin prices shortly after a hard fork tend to take a hit and then rebound.  Take bitcoin cash for example. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin, forked on Aug. 1, 2017. In just four months time, the resulting cryptocurrency network dubbed bitcoin cash hit an all-time market capitalization of $69 billion with one BCH trading at roughly $4,000.  The markets have since cooled considerably but the spin-off network is still ranked among the top five most highly valued blockchain networks in the world. This despite having undergone its own network split in November of last year and a presumed 51 percent attack in May.  As such, for users of the near $700 million blockchain network that is Zcash, the creation of Ycash at roughly 3:00 UTC on Friday, July 19 may mark the beginning of a new source of investment returns.  But in order for users to properly take advantage of their new YEC holdings, they must ensure they're in control of their own private keys and wallet addresses. Alternatively, they can also ensure that the exchange on which they are holding their ZEC tokens offers support for the Zcash/Ycash network split.  Crypto exchanges including Binance, OKex, Coinbase and Huobi have yet to affirm support for the impending launch of Ycash.  A spokesperson for Binance told CoinDesk the team would be evaluating ""community feedback"" surrounding the coin to determine a possible future listing.  What it means for ZEC holders  If you are a holder of ZEC, Loo tells CoinDesk one of the best ways to secure access to newly generated YEC coins is by downloading the ZEC wallet.  “In order to access Ycash coins, you need to have your Zcash coins at the time of the fork in a wallet that allows you to export your private keys,” explained Loo. “One possible way to claim your coins is to download your ZEC wallet and make sure your coins are in the ZEC wallet at the time of the fork.”  Some cryptocurrency exchanges have publicly announced they will be managing private keys of users to support the network split and ensure equivalent holdings of YEC once the spin-off cryptocurrency in created. These exchanges include but are not limited to SafeTrade, BigONE, Hoo and Citex.  However, for all Zcash users who have left their coins on unsupported exchange platforms, Loo says that downloading ZEC wallets not only secures a user’s holdings of YEC but actually creates “ancillary benefits” to the original Zcash network.  “A ZEC wallet is a Zcash full node so now all of a sudden all of these people who were Zcash users who weren’t running full nodes are now running full nodes because they’re interested in getting their Ycash,” said Loo.  Even so, Zcash Foundation Executive Director Josh Cincinnati says that management of private keys can be a risky endeavor.  Cincinnati told CoinDesk:  “It’s possible you may wind up manipulating your private key on a computer that’s connected to the internet that might have some exploit on it. That’s a tail risk. It’s unlikely something would happen but anytime where you change someone’s security model that way it’s a risk to users.”  As such, Cincinnati says that no matter the “friendly” intentions, there are always risks associated with chain “splits, forks, or anything of the sort” that users should be aware of.  What it means for everyone else  Now, for everyone else who neither holds ZEC or intends to hold YEC, the upcoming blockchain split will simply mark the creation of a new privacy-focused cryptocurrency project.  Ycash at launch will differ from the Zcash blockchain in three key ways.  First, Ycash will implement a tweaked version of the Equihash mining algorithm currently used on the Zcash network. This is meant to prohibit specialized mining hardware known as ASICs from mining on the newly created Ycash network.  However, in time, ASICs can be adapted to take advantage of the tweaked algorithm which is why Loo says the long-term goal for Ycash is to eventually get rid of Equihash entirely. ProgPoW and RandomX are two commodity hardware mining algorithms that the Ycash developer team is researching.  Second, Ycash will implement a reduction to the Founder's Reward rate, which awards 20 percent of block rewards to a development fund on the Zcash blockchain. On Ycash, this percentage will drop to a perpetual 5 percent and be entirely funneled to one non-profit organization led by Loo called the Ycash Foundation.  This reduction to the Founder's Reward is a key part of why Loo started the Ycash initiative.  Loo told CoinDesk:  “I started to see the writing on the wall that there was going to be some subset of the community that favors not honoring the original promise that 90 percent of the money supply be allocated to users via the free-market mining process and that key organizations of the Zcash ecosystem, including the Electric Coin Company, were likely to take that route as well.”  As such, Loo called Ycash a “preemptive move” to preserve the original promise of capping the Founder's Reward rate to just 10 percent of all newly issued coins on the network via block rewards.  The third and final difference will be a cosmetic change to the address formats of Zcash and Ycash addresses. In order to “make it impossible” to accidentally send Zcash to a Ycash address or vice versa, Loo explains that all shielded addresses (these are private addresses on a Zcash-based network) will begin with a “y” instead of a “z”.  “With these bitcoin forks, there was always this concern after the fork of accidentally sending bitcoin to a bitcoin cash address,” said Loo. “To honor the spirit of a friendly fork, we put in engineering effort to change the address format ... so it’s impossible to send Zcash to a Ycash address.""  What's next  For all the preparation that has gone into this self-funded initiative to create a “Zcash-based chain that can be mined on commodity hardware and that honors the original allocation promise,” Loo gives credit for the underpinnings of the idea to the founders of the Zcash, Zooko and Nathan Wilcox.  Their early writings on a pluralistic and multi-coin future, Loo argues, not only coined the term for “friendly forks” but laid the groundwork in making Ycash a reality.  Loo said:  “It’s a credit to them both philosophically and technically because of the technical groundwork they laid. This fork I hope will be safer for users than [other blockchain] forks in the past.”  Since the original unveiling of the Ycash initiative back in April, Loo and his team of developers have completed three different dry runs of the split on the Zcash test network and one privately on the Zcash main network.  “Because I’m a long-term holder of Zcash, I have a vested interest in the health of the Zcash network,” said Howard. “We put a lot of engineering time in making sure the fork goes smoothly.”  Where to watch  For users who want to watch the fork in real-time, cryptocurrency markets site CoinGecko features a public countdown clock and coin price tracking chart. In addition, crypto exchange SafeTrade and blockchain analytics site BitFly are also supporting a Ycash blockchain explorer where users can track block confirmations in real-time.  SafeTrade CEO Jeffrey Galloway said the main thing to watch for will be chain stability and security.  “We’re looking at the stability of both chains at launch and any unusual activity,” said Galloway. “There’s a number of things you can look for. For instance, a high number of confirmations. Having a high number of transaction confirmations [is important] before you accept trades.”  A network statistic Ouimet uses to gauge network security and stability is hashrate. Hashrate is a measure of computing power being contributed by miners on a blockchain network to validate transactions and create new blocks.  “I’d keep an eye on the network hashrates for both ZEC and YEC to see how much computing power leaves the original chain and transfers to the new one,” Ouimet said.  The lower the hashrate is on a network, the easier a potential attacker can overtake a blockchain and meddle with transaction activity.  For these reasons, SafeTrade's Galloway says larger cryptocurrency exchanges will likely choose to begin listing Ycash as a cryptocurrency after it is clear that both the Zcash and Ycash networks are stable with high transaction confirmation counts and hashrate.  Said Galloway:  “If there are bugs in the code, they will be exploited shortly after launch. If there are bugs in the wallet, you’re going to see them exploited shortly after launch. So those are all reasons why exchanges sometimes wait a few days after launch before they list a coin.""

42430747,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxTxh,1563472800,Bitcoin Ransomware That Infiltrated 100 US Enterprises Spreads to China,"A ransomware virus that has successfully infiltrated more than 100 government and private enterprises in the U.S. and internationally has been detected in China, according to a recent Tencent Security report.  Dubbed Ryuk, the pernicious code targets “logistics companies, technology companies and small municipalities” with high data value, demanding bounties upward of $5 million paid in bitcoin, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  In January, Ryuk was thought to be behind a hack of Tribune Publishing, affecting all of the media conglomerate’s outlets. In June, officials in Lake City, Florida paid out a $460,000 ransom after the city’s computer systems went dark. This was two weeks after Riviera Beach, Florida’s $600,000 hijacking.  Ryuk is thought to be a modified version of the Hermes virus, which debuted in August 2018. It spreads through the usual botnet and spam methods, and infiltrates through undefended IP ports.  Once installed, the malicious malware deletes all files related to the intrusion, and kills antivirus processes, thereby obscuring the infection vector. In one case, however, FBI agents found evidence Ryuk entered through a Remote Desktop Protocols brute force attack.  The agency wrote in a Flash:  “After the attacker has gained access to the victim network, additional network exploitation tools may be downloaded… once executed, Ryuk establishes persistence in the registry, injects into running processes, looks for network connected file systems, and begins encrypting files.”  The virus also drops a “RyukReadMe” file that opens the blackmail letter on the victim’s internet browser. The html webpage lists only the two hacker’s email addresses in the upper left hand corner, the name of the virus in the center of the page, and the cryptic phrase “balance of shadow universe” in the bottom right corner.  The FBI has been tracking the virus since 2018 and have noticed a number of modifications. It's reported the Chinese variant simultaneously runs a 32-bit and 64-bit blackmail module, which may enable further evolution of the bug.  It is has not been disclosed how many Chinese enterprises have been infected as of press time, or the total amount the hackers have ransomed.

In fact, he's pleased.  ""These are attacks on Facebook itself that really has nothing to do with crypto has nothing to with Libra it's just Facebook being bad boys you know [they're] concerned about [their] privacy policies,"" he said.  His point, quite simply, is that any scrutiny of crypto in DC is vital.  ""Parts of the hearing so far where they've actually been able to get into conversations about Libra and about crypto have been interesting because on that side of it you've seen some Senators that have been skeptical,"" he said. ""But overall it's kind of it's been encouraging to hear some of the senators talking about 'Hey, this is a good thing.'""  Telpner joined CoinDesk editor Pete Rizzo in a wide-ranging conversation about the legality of Libra and, in the end, what Facebook and the Government will have to do to come to terms with the future of crypto.

42430756,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxUDh,1563462980,"Bitcoin Price Jumps $1K in 30 Minutes to Top $10,000 Again","Bitcoin surged $1,000 in just 30 minutes during U.S. trading hours Thursday, a move that found the leading cryptocurrency rising from $9,335 to a high of $10,400, based on Bitstamp data.  The sudden rally could be associated with the massive unwinding of short BTC/USD positions (profit taking) seen in 30 minutes to 15:00 UTC, as reported by bot powered twitter handle @WhaleCalls.  Prices had dropped to a low of $9,280 at 14:00 UTC, having repeatedly failed to beat the psychological resistance of $10,000 in the Asian session and during early European trading hours. But, bitcoin's price rise is now boding well for the broader market.  Names like litecoin and bitcoin SV are reporting double-digit gains at press time. Meanwhile, ethereum's ETH token and XRP are up 6 percent and 3 percent, respectively.  Bitcoin's dominance rate, the top cryptocurrency's share of total market cap, has also risen to 65.8 percent from 65.4 percent seen earlier today, according to CoinMarketCap.  Looking forward  With the sudden move above $10,000, the prospects of bitcoin breaching the former resistance-turned-support of $9,097 (May 30 high) have weakened. That said, the bulls are not out of the woods yet and a break above $11,080 is needed to invalidate the bearish case.  A high-volume break above $11,080 would violate the bearish lower highs pattern and shift risk in favor of a rise to $12,000. Notably, the move above $10,000 is backed by a rise in buying volumes (green bar). Hence, prices could rise to $11,080 in the next 24 hours.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,400 on Bitstamp, representing 5 percent gains on a 24-hour basis.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42430737,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxTfh,1563451216,"Facebook Libra Risks to Financial Stability Demand 'Highest' Regulatory Standards, Says G7","The G7 group of nations has warned that cryptocurrencies such as Facebook's Libra are a threat to global financial stability.  A task force set up by the G7 to examine the issues said that rules of the ""highest"" standards are needed to minimize the use of digital currencies in money laundering and funding terrorism, Reuters reports Thursday.  Following a meeting of finance chiefs from the G7 in Chantilly, France, this week, the group also said it would address tax issues raised by the digital economy, as per a draft summary of the meeting obtained by Reuters.  As expected, Facbook's Libra and its perceived risks to the monetary control of regulators was high on the agenda at the meeting, although some benefits were also observed.  Benoit Coeure, European Central Bank (ECB) board member and head of the G7 task force, told the G7:  “A global stablecoin for retail purposes could provide for faster and cheaper remittances, spur competition for payments and thus lower costs, and support greater financial inclusion.”  Yet, he went on to say that such cryptocurrencies raise ""serious risks"" to policy priorities, such as anti-money laundering, financing of terrorism, consumer and data protection, competition and compliance with tax rules.  Bank of France governor and and member of the governing council of the ECB, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, also said that, while regulators seek to encourage innovation, ""that cannot come to the detriment of the security of the consumer.” He also said more details were needed regarding gray aspects of Facebook Libra.  A piece in the Financial Times today further quotes Coeure as saying that cryptocurrencies like Libra “could also pose issues related to monetary policy transmission, financial stability and the smooth functioning of and public trust in the global payment system.”  French finance minister Bruno Le Maire echoed previous concerns over the threat to the dominance of national currencies by a token launched by a tech firm with billions of users, saying: “The sovereignty of nations might be weakened or jeopardised by these new currencies.”  The draft document from the G7 stated that “significant work” is required from developers of stablecoins like Libra before regulatory approval is likely to be granted.  The FT cites the document as saying:  “As large technology or financial firms could leverage vast existing customer bases to rapidly achieve a global footprint, it is imperative that authorities be vigilant in assessing risks and implications for the global financial system.""  Among its draft recommendations, the G7 says such stablecoins must meet the highest regulatory standards and come under regulatory oversight. A good legal basis in jurisdictions where they operate is also key in order to guarantee adequate protection for stakeholders and users.  The group further lists the need for “operational and cyber resilience” and secure, transparent management of assets to protect market integrity.

42430745,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxTvh,1563449459,"LibertyX Surpasses 1,000 Bitcoin ATMs Across the US","LibertyX  , the company that launched the first U.S. bitcoin ATM, will expand into 90 retail locations in Arizona and Nevada, according to a statement made Wednesday.  With this move LibertyX now operates more than 1,000 so-called bitcoin ATMs across the country. The latest additions are set up in AMPM, ARCO and Chevron gas stations, as well as select Family Dollar stores.  A partnership with Desert ATM, a non-bank ATM service provider, will enable street-level access bitcoin through user’s debit cards. Chris Yim, CEO of LibertyX, said the convenience and simplicity of bitcoin ATMs removes some of the hurdles to onboarding consumers to cryptocurrencies.  This is not the first milestone the company has passed. In 2014, the company launched the first crypto ATM in America in Boston's South Station. In 2016, it hired the first bitcoin cashier. In 2019, it became the first to enable debit card transactions on traditional, non-bank ATMs, without a hardware upgrade.  ""It was a natural evolution of what we started almost 5 years ago,"" said Yim, speaking about the most recent advancement. ""Our goal is to make bitcoin available on every block in America.""  While LibertyX offered in-person cashier services in the southwest before, this move is the first time the company is integrating with Genmega machines in Arizona and Nevada.  Genmega operates ""approximately half"" of the non-bank retail ATMs that would be compatible with the crypto-transaction enabling software upgrade LibertyX designed. ""There are over 100,000 non-bank ATMs in the US and we hope consumers can buy LibertyX bitcoin from all of them,"" Yim said.  Transaction limits are set at $3,000 worth of bitcoin per day, for customers that pass the KYC requirements.  In the past, Desert ATM had attempted to operate their own crypto machines, but found LibertyX had the experience to roll out the feature effectively, according to the company announcement.  “We’re thrilled with the demand and enthusiasm we’ve seen from ATM operators who have been dying for a scalable, compliant, and capital-efficient bitcoin solution,” said Yim, in a statement. ""There are not many crypto companies still around from 2014 and we are proud not only to have survived, but thrived over the years.

42430757,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxUBh,1563447623,Bitcoin Bounce Capped by $10K Price Resistance,"View  Bitcoin's recovery from $9,049 to $10,000 lacks substance and may be short lived.  Signs of bullish exhaustion near $10,000 have emerged on the 4-hour chart. A break below $9,580 would confirm the corrective bounce has ended and allow a drop to $9,000.  Moving average (MA) studies and key indicators like the relative strength and the Chaikin money flow indices on the daily chart continue to call a bearish move.  A high-volume break above $10,000 could yield a move to $10,400, but a 4-hour close above $11,080 is needed to invalidate the short-term bearish setup.      Bitcoin's recovery from one-month lows looks to have stalled near $10,000 and the cryptocurrency may end up charting a bearish lower high around the psychological resistance level.  The top cryptocurrency by market value slipped to $9,049 in the European trading hours yesterday, the lowest level since June 19, according to Bitstamp data. That drop came after the bullish higher-lows pattern was invalidated with a move below $9,614 on Tuesday.  The drop was short-lived, as expected, though. Prices bounced up in the U.S. trading hours, keeping the former resistance-turned-support of the $9,097 May 30 high intact.  The recovery, however, looks to have run out of steam, and BTC has spent a better part of the last 13 hours struggling to settle above $10,000.  A persistent failure to convincingly beat $10,000 means the market is no longer viewing sub-$10,000 levels as an opportunity to get involved in the bull market the way it did on July 2, when prices charted a V-shaped recovery from $9,614 to $11,000.  Further, technical charts indicate the bounce seen in the last 24 hours lacks volume support. So, the odds appear stacked in favor of the creation of a bearish lower high at $10,000 and a fall back to $9,000 in the next day or two.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,850 on Bitstamp, representing 3.5 percent gains on the day.  Hourly chart  Buying volumes (green bars) on the hourly chart have been very low throughout the price bounce from $9,049 to today's high of $10,027.  A low-volume recovery often ends up as a ""dead cat bounce"" – a short-lived recovery after a notable price drop – meaning BTC will likely fall back to $9,000.  Sell volumes (red bars) have been consistently higher than buying volumes ever since BTC topped out at $13,200 on July 10 – a sign of change in market sentiment.  4-hour and daily chart  Multiple candles with long upper wicks (above left) near $10,000 indicate BTC's recovery has run out of steam near $10,000. A break below $9,580 – the low of the doji candle created in the Asian trading hours – would confirm a bearish lower high at $10,000 and allow a drop to $9,000.  The bearish view would be invalidated only if prices invalidate the lower-highs pattern with a high-volume move above $11,080.  That, however, looks unlikely as the daily chart is biased bearish. The 5- and 10-day moving averages are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. The 5- and 50-day MAs are teasing a bearish crossover.  The Chaikin money flow index is now barely holding in positive territory compared to highs above 0.35 seen at the end of June. That indicates a significant weakening of buying pressure.  Further, the relative strength index is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 print.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

However, it isn't changing the way she invests.  ""It doesn't really change my thesis,"" she said. ""It only really changes a thesis if your focus pretty much on investing in payments because Facebook, if it gets approved, becomes a dominant player and then any other startup and that space can't compete.""  Instead, she said, Libra reduces the risk associated with cryptocurrency. After all, if the world's biggest social network is in the space, how can you go wrong?  ""On a macro level it does reduce risk so part of what I focus on in the portfolio is risk management,"" she said. She considers Libra ""very important [as] this eliminates some of the regulatory risk out there.""  Amoils is a venture capitalist and lawyer and has been watching the crypto space for years. She sees Libra as a platform play.  ""[Facebook's David Marcus] talked a lot about the entrepreneurial efforts and intentionally being open source and allowing developers to commit on top and build wallets or other products on top of what they've already laid the groundwork for,"" Amoils said  ""It encourages entrepreneurial development,"" she said.

42430760,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxUHh,1563444012,Web Search Data Indicates Soaring Interest for Facebook Libra in China,"With Facebook's recently unveiled Libra cryptocurrency high in the news agenda across the world in recent weeks, China has emerged as a perhaps surprising leader when it comes to public interest in the project.  While cryptocurrency use is banned in the country, as is Facebook itself, searches for ""Libra"" on the nation's web search giant Weibo are soaring at press time.  While the top two hottest search trends address a Chinese film celebrity's jealous children and the first movement of Leonardo da Vinci's iconic Mona Lisa painting outside the Louvre since 2005, Libra searches are currently ranking in third place, and were in second place previously.  The regional fascination in Facebook's proposed stablecoin – which is intended to provide a means of payment initially, but could expand to other use cases in time – is also backed up by a look at Google Trends data.  Google's data on people looking for information on ""Facebook Libra,"" which peaked around the time of Facebook's June 18 white paper launch, indicates that China is the number one ranked nation for that search term. Also surprisingly, the U.S. is down at number 14 on that list.  It should be added that Google is officially blocked in China, but enough people appear to be sidestepping that block to register significant searches for Facebook's token.  While the growing concerns from global regulators have also dominated headlines in recent days, Google searches for ""Facebook Libra regulation"" are currently too low to indicate regional preferences.  Curiously, even though Libra may not see launch to the public for a year or more, plenty of people are searching for ""Facebook Libra price,"" with Pakistan, Singapore and South Africa registering most searches for that term.  Overall, though, interest in Facebook's token pales into insignificance when compared to bitcoin, which, when compared on Google trends, appears an almost flat blue line dominated by the massive interest in the top cryptocurrency by market value.

A report from Reuters on Thursday cites a source familiar with the effort as saying that the network is aimed to combat money laundering and was approved last month by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  A team from the international money laundering task force would monitor development of the project, which will be conducted alongside other nations, the source said.  The network is an initiative from Japan's Ministry of Finance and the Financial Services Agency (FSA) watchdog. Reuters said both agencies would not comment when contacted.  Japan had been more closely scrutinizing crypto exchanges as the host of a June meeting by the G20 group of nations, and also launched a working group to discuss regulatory issues around Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency prior to the G7 meeting last week.  The nation has suffered a number of notable hacks of crypto exchanges, including two of the world's biggest and most shocking: Mt. Gox and Coincheck.  Largely as a result of the Gox breach, Japan has been one of thee most proactive countries when it comes to regulation of cryptos.

42430759,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxUFh,1563436848,"For $15K, He'll Fake Your Exchange Volume – You'll Get on CoinMarketCap","The Takeaway  Gotbit inflates trading volumes on obscure cryptocurrency exchanges for a fee and has about 30 token projects as clients.  The firm programs bots to trade tokens back and forth with each other, creating the illusion of active markets so the assets can get listed on CoinMarketCap. Its co-founder says exchanges are aware of this manipulation but are not interested in stopping it.  While it's rare to hear market manipulators talk openly about their trade, there are other businesses like this out there, experts say.      To cryptocurrency professionals trying to legitimize their industry, market manipulation is a scourge. To 20-year-old Alexey Andryunin, it's a living.  A sophomore at Moscow State University, Andryunin is the co-founder of Gotbit, a firm that specializes in making obscure cryptocurrencies look like they're being actively traded. For a fee, the two-man shop will program bots to trade a token back and forth with each other on also-ran exchanges until it has enough ""volume"" to get listed on CoinMarketCap. Once it appears on that influential market data site, an asset can gain the attention of larger platforms and bigger investors.  Explaining why Gotbit is not registered in any jurisdiction, Andryunin was blunt, telling CoinDesk:  ""The business is not entirely ethical.""  The business is not entirely unheard-of, either, in a global market notorious for its lack of transparency. Bitwise Asset Management, one of several U.S. firms seeking regulatory approval to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), has estimated that 95 percent of bitcoin trading volumes are faked and only 10 exchanges publish reliable data about volumes on their platforms, without inflated numbers.  Bobby Ong, CEO of crypto ranking portal CoinGecko, said businesses like Gotbit exist and ""it won't be too hard to find such people who can help you with these services.""  ""These operators usually go around claiming that they can do market-making for token projects and inflate trading volume for a fee. This practice is also known as wash trading and is illegal,"" Ong said.  It is possible to detect wash trading from the outside, Ong noted. Looking at the trade history and order book of exchanges, one can notice certain patterns and see that something fishy is going on:  ""If trades happen outside the bid-ask spread or constantly within the bid-ask spread, this is a clear example of wash-trading in action. One can also look at the trade interval and trade size to detect common recurring patterns to find wash-trading activities.""  However, it's rare to hear manipulators openly discuss their trade, for obvious reasons.  In recent interviews, Andryunin walked CoinDesk through the mechanics of Gotbit's business, which helps crypto projects to literally fake it until they make it.  Extracurricular activity  Andryunin arrived late for our meeting in Moscow City, an upscale business district of metal-and-glass skyscrapers, fancy cafes and the offices of multiple crypto-related businesses. He had just seen a client. The applied math major hardly makes it to classes. Among his classmates, almost everyone is now obsessed with crypto, he said.  He started Gotbit with a fellow undergrad in 2018, while initial coin offerings (ICOs) were still in vogue. His partner codes the trading bots while Andryunin reaches out to token projects to sell Gotbit's ""market-making"" services. Listing on a small exchange costs $8,000; a month of supporting fake trading volumes via algorithms imitating normal market activities will run you $6,000.  Getting the token on CoinMarketCap is a bit steeper at $15,000. To achieve that, first a project needs to get listed on two small exchanges. These platforms would die without artificial volume, Andryunin believes. A telltale sign is that little-known cryptocurrencies trade on these exchanges much more actively than bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency and the industry bellwether with the largest market capitalization.  The exchanges usually know when Gotbit's bots are inflating the volumes of altcoins, Andryunin believes, but higher numbers are in these exchanges' own interest. Policing manipulation is not.  These exchanges charge a couple of bitcoins (about $20,000 at recent prices) to list a token, and have no other real criteria, Andryunin said. As examples of exchanges with such standards, he mentioned Hotbit, based in Shanghai, and BitForex in Hong Kong. Neither exchange responded to CoinDesk's requests for comment by press time.  (After publication, Bitforex branding manager Max P. sent the following statement: ""In a world with an overwhelming number of dubious coins and tokens, a listing fee is standard practice for cryptocurrency exchanges. It goes a long way to determine the seriousness of a partner, ensuring that we are able to bring tokens from projects that are determined to succeed to our users."" BitForex's fees ""are determined according to project scale and operational capacity,"" he added.)  ""It’s well-established that many exchanges likely engage in practices to inflate the volume they report in order to drive interest in their platforms and to attract new customers,"" Alameda Research, a crypto trading firm, said in a recent report. Alameda analyzed the order books and trading history of 48 crypto exchanges worldwide and found that on 14 of them, genuine trading volume might well be zero. BitForex is among the 14.  On such exchanges, Gotbit appears to be the main source of liquidity, Andryunin said. ""These small exchanges, I don't even get it what they are living off, there are no real volumes there.""  After a token is listed on two exchanges and shows some trading activity provided by bots — the volume can be less than $100,000 a day per exchange – there is a chance to get it listed on CoinMarketCap. From there, Gotbit is out of the picture, according to Andryunin, who said other intermediaries help accomplish the last step.  Exactly how they do it, he doesn't know. But it gets done: ""Our clients are at [the] 300-500 positions on CoinMarketCap.""  Carylyne Chan, CoinMarketCap's head of marketing, told CoinDesk that to get listed on the site, a token must satisfy a set of criteria, including using blockchain tech; having a functioning website; being listed on two exchanges that are, in turn, listed on CoinMarketCap; and providing a direct line of communication with a project representative.  Asked if it's possible to fool the system by inflating volume, Chan said: ""Our stance is to list as many crypto assets as possible, covering the universe of crypto assets over time. We are not in the business of censoring information.""  CoinMarketCap also flags projects with suspicious activity on its website, she added, ""based on regulatory circulars or user-submitted information.""  The clients  Gotbit's clients typically have done an ICO and now need to calm their investors by showing some market activity, Andryunin said.  Most of these founders care about their projects and are trying to make them work, he believes, but out of the 30 projects Gotbit is working with, only two or three are ""really creating some value,"" have a working business model and reached the point of building an actual product.  Others can live a couple of months on fake volume, allowing the founders to cash out, then stop paying for the ""market-making,"" after which the token's price will plunge. They close down a couple of months later.  At that point, people who bought those tokens come to terms with reality, Andryunin said, joking:  ""No more Lambo dreams, a bike would be fine.""  CoinGecko's Ong said optics are indeed a motivation for many crypto teams.  ""Token projects are sometimes pressured to use such market-making operators because they need to show their major investors and token holders that there is significant market interest in their project and things are going well,"" he said. ""Some are also doing it because they do not want their price to fall precipitously and want to maintain an 'optimal' price or have it increase over time.""  Part of the pressure, Ong added, comes from exchanges, which require a minimum trading volume and de-list thinly traded tokens.  ""Thus, faced with a delisting option, token projects engage these market-making firms to inflate their volumes artificially,"" Ong said.  In a rare case, one project that used Gotbit's market-making service made it to the top 100 on CoinMarketCap, Andryunin claimed. He wouldn't name the token but said the project had a strong team and business model from the beginning.  Why would a legit team use artificial volume pumping?  ""They wanted to get listed on large exchanges, and get some cash, too,"" Andryunin said.  The bots  To show imaginary volumes, Gotbit's bot fills an exchange’s order book – again, we're talking about small exchanges with minuscule volumes – and closes the orders itself using the same or another account. Usually, clients have four accounts, but two are enough for trading with yourself, Andryunin says.  In order to make these volumes plausible, Andryunin said, Gotbit programs its algorithms to mimic the normal patterns of trading in different parts of the world at different times of the day and year.  Gotbit's pitch deck – yes, it has a pitch deck – features charts of trading volumes it pumped for several tokens, with their names redacted (Andryunin said he signs non-disclosure agreements with clients). Sometimes a client decides to turn off the bot and the volume plunges to zero, if nobody but Gotbit's bot is trading the token.  The volume bot's orders are not supposed to be executed and settled, just create an illusion of trading. In theory, some real holder who purchased tokens during an ICO can come to the exchange and take the orders – in this case, Gotbit would end up with a heavy bag of illiquid coins.  To prevent this from happening, the bot watches the exchange’s wallets on Etherscan, a popular block explorer for the ethereum blockchain, and when there is a big transaction of the coin in question, all orders are immediately canceled. Gotbit works only with the ERC-20 tokens which run on top of ethereum, so it's easy to monitor the movement of funds on the network.  Another Gotbit service is placing buy and sell orders at certain price intervals to control the bid-ask spread, or gap between what buyers are willing to pay and sellers are willing to accept. Normally, this spread is a strong signal of market maturity or lack thereof; a tight spread shows sufficient demand and supply to meet at a compromise price, while a wider spread indicates an illiquid market.  Hence, Andryunin said, some projects want to show that their tokens are traded at a narrow spread, to create the impression that there is a live, healthy market for the coin.  Gotbit also has an algorithm allowing the bots to dump a token without affecting the price: to do that, the bot looks for buy orders already present in the order book and quickly fills them.  This is possible, he said, if there are at least some real buyers on the market – sheep, as Andryunin calls them, which are herded into the market by the projects and then ""shaved"" when the price is high (pumped by the bot).  Time to close up shop  Andryunin has no illusions about the future of his business.  As regulation of the crypto market gets tighter across the globe, the world of little exchanges full of junk coins with bizarre charts will ultimately be stamped out, he acknowledged.  The main factor, he said, will be the new international guidance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for regulating crypto-related services and exchanges, which will require more stringent customer-identification processes akin to traditional banking.  ""I think FATF will shut it down quickly: the cryptocurrency exchanges will be regulated like NASDAQ and pumping fake volumes will be banned,"" Andryunin said, adding:  ""I’m not big on legal questions, but I think doing on NASDAQ what we are doing here would be a financial crime. And the exchanges will have to monitor it that people are not trading with themselves. Otherwise the exchanges will get blacklisted.""  Hence, Gotbit’s market-making business is winding down, and the team is switching to other services, the most popular of which is initial exchange offerings (IEOs), a type of ICO that is conducted on an exchange.  Besides, Andryunin said, he and his partner have a more prosaic concern: to get through final exams.

In this video, Llanos, a FinTech and RegTech Advisor, explores the things that Libra will potentially change. He says that Facebook has essentially sewn up the payments market for years to come and warns startups to focus on exchanging currencies and creating wallets to support other currencies.  How did it already win? Because of Facebook's horde of fiat cash - thanks to the seemingly antiquated business of selling eyeballs to advertisers - the company has already paid for all the things most payments startups have to work diligently to afford.  ""If you think about Facebook before crypto, Facebook Payments was already an MSB and money services businesses are regulated by FinCEN at the federal level,"" he said. ""They had licenses in all the States.""

42430749,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxTzh,1563422400,Coder Proposes Alternative to Bitcoin's 'Notoriously Unreliable' Testnet,"Introduced Wednesday, a new proposal called Signet offers a fresh alternative to bitcoin's test network.  The software plays a crucial role for developers, serving as a place where they can test their apps, to make sure they work reasonably well on the network by putting only test money on the line. Further, protocol developers can use it to test the viability and safety of big changes to bitcoin, such as Segregated Witness, one of the best-known and largest-scale bitcoin changes.  But bitcoin's current testnet, which has been around in its current form for years, has its share of problems. In a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) posted to the bitcoin developer email list, Bitcoin Core contributor Karl-Johan Alm goes as far as to call it ""notoriously unreliable.""  He hopes to change that with a new type of testnet for bitcoin that gets around the old testnet's problems.  Alm told CoinDesk:  ""Signet is like bitcoin, but it is completely centralized and controlled by one or several people. These people have to sign a block for it to actually be valid.""  Many of the problems with the testnet have to do with mining blocks, which is more erratic on the testnet than on the real bitcoin network. A few of the problems, Alm argues in the BIP, are: ""Huge block reorgs, long gaps in between blocks being mined or sudden bursts of blocks in rapid succession mean that realistic testing of software, especially involving multiple independent parties running software over an extended period of time, becomes infeasible in practice.""  ""Reorgs"" are when one block is replaced with another block.  To a degree, this happens naturally in bitcoin because it's a distributed network with nodes scattered all over the world, so it takes a bit of time for the nodes to come to agreement on block and transaction history. If two blocks are broadcast at about the same time from different parts of the network, one block might seem valid to some of the network, and another block valid to the rest of the network. So, the network needs some time to reconcile these conflicting blocks.  The problem is that this event happens much more frequently - and on a larger scale - on the test network.  ""The goal is not to be perfectly reliable but rather to have a predictable amount of unreliability. You want a test network to behave like mainnet (i.e. no thousands of block reorgs) while also making it easier to trigger expected but rare events like a 6-block reorg,"" the BIP explains.  As a centralized testnet alternative, Signet would help to alleviate these types of problems.  ""Signet helps prevent these problems because the signer is fixed. Making blocks can be pretty cheap because you don't compete with anyone, and there is no security issue with a low hash rate since nobody else has the private keys. Since the network is highly coordinated, reorgs will basically never occur, except if the network operators want them to,"" Alm told CoinDesk.  Though there is a test Signet live already, his next goal is to get support for the change merged into Bitcoin Core, so that people can use it like the current testnet. In the proposal, Alm also linked to a rough draft Signet code implementation that other developers can test.
