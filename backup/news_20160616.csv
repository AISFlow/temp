42378742,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhZr,1466116175,Customers Sue Alleged Crypto Ponzi Scheme GAW Miners,"A civil lawsuit has been filed on behalf of the customers of the now-defunct cryptocurrency mining company GAW Miners, naming its CEO and a longtime investor as defendants.  Filed in the US District Court in Connecticut, the suit names two firms, GAW Miners and ZenMiner, as well as CEO Homero Joshua Garza and investor Stuart Fraser, the latter of whom previously served as vice chairman of Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald.  The complaint features many of the longstanding allegations levied against GAW Miners since the firm collapsed in mid-2015, including that it purposefully mislead customers about its operations, both in connection with its mining services as well as the cryptocurrency it released, paycoin.  In many ways, the suit mirrors the one filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in December, which indicted Garza on allegations of securities fraud and the operation of a Ponzi scheme.  Judge Jeffrey Mayer stayed that suit in April, a move that came after a series of postponements were filed by the defense that sought to extend their response to the SEC’s charges. The new civil suit’s plaintiffs – former customers Denis Marc Audet, Michael Pfeiffer, Dean Allen Shinners and Jason Vargas – are seeking class-action certification and have requested a trial by jury.  The complaint accuses Garza, GAW and ZenMiner of committing securities fraud and common law fraud, and seeks to hold Fraser liable as well. According to court filings, the plaintiffs are seeking ""damages against defendants for their violations of federal and state securities laws and state common law"" as well as any associated court expenses.  The civil suit complaint states:  ""Defendants used the lure of quick riches from a twenty-first century payment system known as virtual currency to defraud investors. Though cloaked in technological sophistication and jargon, defendants’ fraud was simple at its core – defendants sold what they did not own and misrepresented the nature of what they were selling.""  Marjorie Peerce, a defense attorney who is representing Garza in the suit filed by SEC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Cantor Fitzgerald.  Hashlets as securities  Prior to its collapse, GAW had faced accusations that it was selling more mining power than it actually possessed, providing payouts with the proceeds obtained from customers who were buying ""Hashlets"", virtualized mining products that the SEC later asserted constituted securities.  GAW shut down its mining operations in early 2015, and the firm was later sued by a Mississippi electrical utility that provided electricity to its mine in the state. Emails leaked amid the firm’s collapse and testimony from former employees later bolstered the Ponzi scheme claims, which ultimately formed the crux of the SEC’s suit.  The civil suit details a variety of allegations levied against Garza and GAW, including one tied to the creation of a mining product advertised as a vehicle for raising charity funds for a memorial fund dedicated to those who died following the terrorist attacks on 9/11. The SEC previously included this charge in its December 2015 indictment.  Like the SEC, plaintiffs named ZenMiner as a defendant, though both the government and former employees have alleged that it was a venture controlled entirely by Garza but falsely represented as a separate company.  Cantor connection  Notably, the complaint details the long-standing relationship between Garza and Fraser, the latter of whom featured in some of the company’s marketing materials and was cited during an interview with The Wall Street Journal as evidence that GAW was not a Ponzi scheme.  ""Why would a guy that already has a ton of money, and would get thrown in jail if he was involved in anything sketchy, be involved in a scam?"" Garza told the Journal at the time.  Company emails leaked amid the collapse of GAW in the spring of 2015 detail Fraser’s involvement, who owned as much as 41% of the firm and communicated frequently with Garza via digital means.  The suit also makes reference to a series of emails leaked last spring that detail the connection between Cantor and GAW. At least one meeting was held between officials at the firm and GAW staff, though it does not appear that Cantor ever made an investment or moved past initial exploration.  Fraser's biographical information was later removed from the Cantor Fitzgerald website.  Fraser was also involved with a GAW-related Internet service provider venture that operated primarily in the Northeast US. That firm later attracted broad criticism after customers began complaining about service outages and a lack of responsiveness from company representatives.  The filing comes months after an effort to launch a civil lawsuit against GAW and its leadership first materialized. According to organizer Allen Shinners, much of the delay had to do with finding a law firm willing to take the case.

42378741,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhW5,1466102304,Only a Test: Bank of Canada Comments on CAD-Coin Trial,"Canada’s central bank unveiled a blockchain-based interbank payment experiment earlier this week, a move the institution said in new statements isn’t intended to launch a new e-money system.  When reached for comment, Central Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins said that the ‘CAD-coin’ project was intended “solely to better understand the technology first-hand”.  Notably, she said that the scope of the Canadian central bank’s work is devoted to the interbank area, and that a number of key questions remain on the table.  Wilkins told CoinDesk:  ""Other frameworks need to be investigated, and there are many hurdles that need to be cleared before such a system would be ever be ready for prime time. None of our experiments are to develop central-bank issued e-money‎ for use by the general public. These are still conceptual research questions that are being investigated by many central banks.""  The CAD-coin system  would enable the exchange of Canadian dollars for a digital version which could be settled at participating banks. The project constitutes a closed blockchain network, with financial institutions and the central bank forming the group of participants.  The central bank itself would own and operate the system, if implemented.  The presentation of CAD-coin came a day before a now-cancelled speech by Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who was expected to deliver a major policy speech on financial technology and blockchain in particular. Carney’s speech was cancelled in the wake of the murder of UK Parliament member Jo Cox.

42378743,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhYb,1466099719,How a 3-D Printed Building Became the Center of Blockchain in Dubai,"While its unconventional design and vivid white facade may draw the eyes of passersby, at the 3D printed headquarters for Dubai’s Museum of the Future, it’s a series of neatly folded name cards that perhaps tells the more impressive story.  Inside the government-backed incubator, diverse participants gathered for the most recent meeting of Dubai’s Global Blockchain Council (GBC), a 40-member group formed to investigate blockchain and digital currencies. Far from members of IT teams, attendees included executives from tech giants like IBM and Ericsson as well as leaders of regional startups, trade bureaus, free economic zones and commodities exchanges.  The topic of focus in the run-up to the closed-door event was Keynote 2016, the blockchain conference the group had sponsored just days before, and all seemed focused on one issue – whether Dubai had sent the message to the wider international business community that it is serious about blockchain.  While the meeting was closed to the public, Saif Al Aleeli, CEO of Dubai Museum of the Future Foundation, shared his take on the event, providing insight into why the group is looking to blockchain as a way to accelerate economic growth in Dubai.  Al Aleeli told CoinDesk:  ""[Blockchain] touches everything from public records to contracts to economic exchange. Our message is 'We are interested, we are serious, and we want to get real work done today.'""  According to Al Aleeli, there is widespread belief in the local government that blockchain could help improve its own ability to offer services to consumers and businesses. The GBC, he said, sees its mandate in this wider context.  ""Blockchain and the GBC are an essential component of positioning UAE as a global center for shaping the future,"" he said.  As such, it's Al Aleeli's Museum of the Future, a government initiative that's part physical destination, part think tank, that has emerged as the driver of this activity by creating the GBC and helping support and steer its agenda.  In addition to organizing and hosting the meetings, the Museum of the Future also plays a key role in connecting those interested in furthering its explorations.  In just a few short months, the GBC has announced seven proofs-of-concept (PoCs) for blockchain-based systems for everything from promoting local tourism to securing the health records of residents.  According to attendees, topics of conversation at the meeting included the messaging the GBC should take given its visibility in the wider Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the progress being made on proofs-of-concept and how these projects could become among the first in the world to be released.  Challenges ahead  Just months into the effort, the GBC is now beginning to look at how to advance its work through projects that will resonate with the international community.  While the work underway has gained the attention of the regional media, members of the GBC voiced the belief that, to truly make an impact, it will mean advancing projects so that they are among the first globally to move out of the sandbox and into the real world.  Al Aleeli explained how the GBC is currently working within the existing regulatory context to encourage innovation, and that this means working in areas where the group is confident it can advance its work.  ""Major free zones have a regulatory authority to encourage certain kinds of innovation, as long as it conforms with overall federal regulations where applicable,"" he said.  As in many other parts of the world, as projects near completion, the GBC intends to begin a process of educating a wider network of regulators and lawmakers.  As for how lengthy this process may be, even with government support, Al Aleeli noted that each emirate in the UAE has its own regulation, and that financial activities are governed by the Central Bank of the UAE.  In this context, it may be best to consider the GBC as a sandbox to workshop initiatives so that the tech can be considered more broadly by necessary stakeholders in the country's business sector.  Growing membership  With increased visibility, however, new challenges are arising.  The group is attracting more new members, with Dubai Trade, the Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange and the Dubai Department of Economic Development being the most recent. Local and international startups Kraken, BitOasis, Umbrellab and Loyyal are also among its ranks.  Al Aleeli voiced his belief that this is positive, as the group has so far appealed to a diversity of stakeholders in the UAE because of its combination of participants.  ""The group is unique because it includes both the people creating the demand and the people meeting that demand. This gives us the unique ability to craft partnerships within the group that could have tremendous impact,"" Al Aleeli said.  But, the GBC has had to take steps to rethink how it will add new members and needed expertise.  Al Aleeli said that, going forward, the GBC will focus on adding members that represent industries or skill sets that may be underrepresented today.  One particular need, Al Aleeli said, is for technical expertise, an area where the group's challenges are perhaps not unique.  Al Aleeli concluded:  ""We may be interested in inducting more blockchain development and solutions companies in the near future, but otherwise the council is almost at capacity.""

42378753,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhlB,1466096462,Bitcoin Price Passes $750 to Hit 28-Month High,"The price of bitcoin broke $750 today, building on recent gains to hit a 28-month high.  Bitcoin prices reached $750.37 during the day's session, the highest since 7th February, 2014, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal. The digital currency exceeded its latest milestone of $750 after surpassing $700 early on 13th June, and then nearing $720 later that day.  Of late, bitcoin has benefited from a multitude of factors, including concerns about China’s economy, anticipation surrounding the upcoming halving and fear of a Brexit, and this momentum is showing signs it is continuing to build.  The digital currency suffered a notable drop on 14th June, falling more than 8% and coming within a few percentage points of a correction. While such a decline might have prompted concerns it had become overvalued, the digital currency’s recent gains support the position this was merely a temporary pullback.  Going forward, bitcoin could easily enjoy further appreciation, as data provided by bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub indicates short interest has dwindled to practically zero while long interest has hit an all-time high.  Past that, the digital currency could easily benefit from the visibility that blockchain technology has been generating.  A wide range of market participants, central banks and other entities have been examining this distributed ledger’s potential uses, and as the technology draws more attention, it may draw mainstream traders to the nascent market.  While market experts have provided various explanations for bitcoin’s recent price appreciation, one variable they are pointing to as having key importance is the upcoming halving of network rewards.

42378746,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhcN,1466088919,Sweden Tests Blockchain Smart Contracts for Land Registry,"The government of Sweden is testing a system for registering and recording land titles that utilizes blockchain in a bid to digitize real estate processes.  Lantmäteriet  , or the Swedish National Land Survey, revealed todayhttp://chromaway.pr.co/130410-sweden-launch-leading-blockchain-solution-for-land-registry that it is working with blockchain startup ChromaWay, consulting firm Kairos Future and telephone service provider Telia on a proof-of-concept that investigates how blockchain tech could reduce the risk of manual errors while creating more secure processes for transferring documents.  For the proof-of-concept, ChromaWay CEO Henrik Hjelte indicated that Telia’s technology was used to verify the identity of users registered on a new smart contract system developed by his startup. The demo serves as the first showcase for ChromaWay's technology, which it said allows smart contracts to be used with any underlying blockchain, be it bitcoin, Ethereum or a private network.  Kairos Future, in turn, managed the process and coordinated an accompanying report, while Lantmäteriet provided feedback and sponsorship for the effort.  Kairos Future senior consultant Magnus Kempe indicated that he believes the biggest benefit of the project is the transparency that the blockchain-based system could provide, and how it could position Sweden as a leader in working with the nascent technology.  Kempe told CoinDesk:  ""What we’re focused on here is the smart contract controlling and making the process visible and transparent. Credit documents are normally something that the buyer and the buyer’s bank are only meant to see, and this technology will allow that to be held private.""  Going forward, Kempe and Hjeltes said that Stockholm-based Landshypotek Bank has already signed on to provide additional funding for the project. Further, they said more banks and real estate industry experts would be consulted to help build on the project.  The project comes as governments around the world are showing growing interest in using blockchain technology to improve the land registry process.  In April, bitcoin mining and technology company BitFury unveiled a pilot with the National Agency of Public Registry in the Republic of Georgia. The project followed a reported initiative in Honduras that popularized the concept, yet has failed to fully materialize with public acknowledgement from the government.

42378750,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhjv,1466080259,Bank of Canada Demos Blockchain-Based Digital Dollar,"The Central Bank of Canada revealed yesterday it is developing a digital version of the Canadian dollar based on blockchain technology.  Called CAD-coin, the project is part of a wider exploration of the emerging technology codenamed Project Jasper that was reportedly unveiled during a private presentation, according to The Financial Times. Other major banks including Bank of Montreal, CIBC, Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank and TD Bank, as well as banking consortium startup R3CEV, are said to be involved in the effort.  A slide posted by Forbes provides more details, indicating that the Bank of Canada is testing a system in which participants would post cash to be held by the bank that would then be converted into CAD-coin.  Verified counterparties would then process transactions, and the central bank would reserve the right to destroy CAD-coins as needed.  The unveiling notably precedes a scheduled speech by Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins, set for Friday, that will find the central bank issuing more details about the program and its stance on the technology.  Further, the announcement comes just a day before the Bank of England is expected to divulge further details about its interest in blockchain technology during a speech by governor Mark Carney in London.  Just last week, representatives from more than 90 central banks gathered at the Federal Reserve for a question-and-answer session in which presentations and discussions were held on blockchain and its potential role in finance.  The Bank of Canada did not respond to requests for further information at press time.
