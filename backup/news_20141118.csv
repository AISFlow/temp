42377816,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fhP,1416351617,Blockstream: $21 Million Funding Will Drive Bitcoin Development,"While VC firms have demonstrated an overwhelming interest in funding the wider bitcoin industry, its core developers have long argued that contributions to the advancement of its protocol have lagged dangerously behind.  To the team behind Blockstream, however, its $21m funding round announced yesterday represents the first concerted execution of capital toward correcting this imbalance.  The funding will be used principally by the company to realize its sidechains proposal on the bitcoin network, which would allow assets to be exchanged across multiple blockchains via a two-way pegging system. Blockstream contends this would allow developers new freedoms of experimentation and provide the network with a way to trial potential alterations.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CEO Austin Hill sought to frame the funding as an investment that is as revolutionary as those contributed to space transportation pioneer SpaceX and electronic car giant Tesla Motors.  He said:  ""These things didn’t happen overnight, they took a concentrated effort to actually move science and technology forward, and bitcoin requires that. But we’re only millimeters in a potential marathon of digitizing assets, and it's very, very important that we take that long view.""  In turn, both Hill and co-founder Adam Back asserted that the experienced tech veterans that took part in the round – including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and Google chairman Eric Schmidt – recognize that bitcoin's core technology requires massive funding to reach its full potential, and that Blockstream's investors share its long-term vision for bitcoin.  ""We showed them our vision for how bitcoin and the blockchain could evolve, and they saw the same potential we did,"" Hill added. ""They saw that it was going to be an entire revolution in computing, distributed trust, [and] security, and they bought into it and gave us their support.""  A technology problem  Hill sought to portray the sizeable funding as one that would enable Blockstream to focus on long-term architecture decisions that would later support a whole ecosystem of potential business opportunities.  The serial entrepreneur and co-founder of privacy technology startup Zero-Knowledge Systems compared the launch of Blockstream to that of Google, arguing that, at the time of its launch, many market observers questioned the need for a search engine given that AltaVista and Yahoo had already been developed.  ""Google focused on a technology problem of how do you actually make all the world’s information accessible at the click of a button and that was a hard engineering problem ... you’ve seen entire industries be changed because of that,"" Hill said.  Hill explained that Blockstream's technology problem is more largely about how how society manages all manner of financial instruments and documents to solve inefficiencies. He suggested that Blockstream will seek to pioneer some of these lines of business, while allowing the open-source bitcoin community to handle others.  ""There are so many businesses that will be born out of this and many of these will be businesses that we don’t choose to be in, frankly,"" Hill said.  Above all, however, Hill contended that what is needed first, is for the technology to begin developing at a more rapid pace.  Open-source approach  Although Blockstream has come under fire from community members who feel the company represents a turn toward centralizing key aspects of bitcoin's development process, Hill and Back indicated the company would demonstrate a commitment to open-source principles.  ""The entire project was born out of the open-source community, so the idea that we would do anything that isn’t open source or isn’t decentralized or open permission-less innovation is anti-bitcoin,"" Hill said.  Hill drew comparisons to open-source software product giant Red Hat and e-commerce software solution Magento as companies that have fostered entire communities of businesses in the manner that Blockstream is seeking to achieve.  Blockstream, he suggested, is a continuation of past innovation in the bitcoin space and seeks to empower the elements that have already contributed to making bitcoin the global transaction system it is today.  Collaborating with bitcoin core  Blockstream also sought to frame its organization as interoperable with the bitcoin core development team, noting that some of its developers such as Greg Maxwell, Pieter Wuille and Matt Corallo have been long-time contributors to the bitcoin network.  Because of these relationships, Blockstream said it believes it can operate as a company, even as core development lies outside of its direct influence. In part, Hill described Blockstream as a solution to this common developer dilemma, saying that sidechains will allow for experimentation on bitcoin, without large-scale changes.  ""You’ve seen instances where people want to make changes to bitcoin or they want to make changes to bitcoin in certain ways,"" Hill said. ""Bitcoin has to be cautious because it’s protecting $5bn in value and you don’t want to tinker with it ... It’s hard to justify making changes to something that is so mission critical.""  Back put sidechains into more concrete terms, posing them as a solution to bitcoin's scalability and security issues, and suggesting that they will bring more off-blockchain activity back to bitcoin's main ledger.  ""With sidechains you can move forward with a kind of beta version of bitcoin with real value in it and add some of those features so that the projects that need access to those features can start to use them, add validation to it. Eventually that implementation could become a major upgrade,"" Back added.  This new capability, he argues, will benefit both the technology as a whole and entreprenuers.  Enticing developers  Of course, Blockstream must also entice strong developers to its platform, something that the company acknowledged is complicated by the increasing number of more advanced blockchain applications in the crypto 2.0 segment of the industry.  ""There’s a lot of education that needs to occur, there’s a lot of communication, and we look forward to the coming months where we’re going to be publishing more details, more technical details, sample code on GitHub, and allow people to start experimenting with various parts of the technology stack,"" Hill said.  The CEO said that Blockstream will strive to illustrate how sidechains can be used to empower entrepreneurial development, and that for now, this means educating developers through workshops and co-development.  Back suggested that developers should keep in mind that competing systems will need to replicate bitcoin's network effect, something he said would be a challenge to any project seeking to replicate aspects of what bitcoin's technology can provide.  ""Once something takes hold and gets going, it makes more sense to focus on and build around and on top of that, and we feel that sidechains are the best way to do that,"" he said.  Sidechains today  As for what that means in the short term, Back and Hill were less clear. Back indicated that sidechains are up and running on an internal test network and that Blockstream is currently in talks with an undisclosed number of potential pilot customers.  Currently, Blockstream is selecting co-development partners who are provided with early access to some of the development. This allows them to collaborate on making sure that the use cases – and the technology that supports them – accomplish their goals, Hill said.  As for deliverables, he acknowledged that company has a responsibility to its investors to show progress, but he did not share any specific goals.  ""Right now that progress is deploying and interacting with the community, showcasing how sidechains and bitcoin and this ecosystem can evolve,"" he said. ""We have some strategic objectives that we think are important that are not being done about the ecosystem.""  Blockstream, Hill added, hopes to publicize potential use cases of its technology, but this is likely to take some time. He went on to estimate that the sidechains project would likely be open to the general public during the first half of 2015.

42377819,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fmR,1416347197,ChangeTip Releases New Metrics Amid Surge in Bitcoin Tipping Interest,"Bitcoin tipping service ChangeTip has reported increasing user activity, claiming that it has signed up 34,000 users since it was founded last December.  The company told CoinDesk that it completed 10,000 transactions in one day last week. This represented one-sixth of its total transaction volume, ChangeTip's founder Nick Sullivan said.  Although usage has increased ""across the board"" on metrics Sullivan monitors, he wasn't able to identify the reason for the growth spurt. He did emphasise that the company has increased its resources devoted to community management, however.  Sullivan said:  ""We've definitely had a really big set of days over the last few weeks ... We've ramped up our community management efforts and made sure our top tippers are getting all the love and attention they deserve.""  The statistics presented by Sullivan can't easily be corroborated independently.  According to Currly, a website that monitors traffic on subreddits, ChangeTip's subreddit saw a surge in subscribers that peaked on 6th November, meaning some 1,730 people are currently subscribed.  Sullivan said there was strong demand for a tool that displayed ChangeTip metrics publicly, and that his firm would release this offering in the first quarter of 2015.  Emphasizing community management  ChangeTip  allows users to send tiny amounts of bitcoin to others over seven social networks including Twitter, Reddit and GitHub.  To manage activity across these platforms, the company has hired a dedicated staffer to oversee engagement with users, Bitcoin Magazine and CoinDesk contributor Victoria Van Eyk, and recruited power users to spread the gospel – and send tips – through its social networks.  Two power users have been recruited so far, Sullivan said. One promoter is now an employee, while the other is a volunteer.  ""The most zealous community members, who love what we're doing, will help us pull others into the fold. It's very similar to when I worked at Wikia ... turning the most avid users into employees,"" he said.  ChangeTip  said more than half its users have tipped others using two or more social media accounts and claimed that 47,000 social media accounts are connected to its platform.  According to Sullivan, the vast majority of ChangeTip users are passive, sitting back and collecting tips.  He said 9% of users were more active, depositing funds to ChangeTip accounts, while 2% are power users who are intent on ""spreading the goodwill of bitcoin"" using his service.  Reaching celebrity users  One way zealous ChangeTip users promote the service, and bitcoin, is by tipping celebrities. So far, actors William Shatner and Will Wheaton, musician Snoop Dogg (aka Snoop Lion) and President Barack Obama have received tips.  Sullivan said Shatner, Snoop Dogg and Wheaton have become ChangeTip users and claimed their tips, although President Obama hasn't done so yet.    @WilliamShatner, @jqsjqs wants to send you a Starship Enterprise (20.419 mBTC/$10.00) Collect➔http://t.co/ucuOKAw8Ca      — ChangeTip (@ChangeTip) September 6, 2014      Sullivan described a vision for ChangeTip to operate as a kind of 'like' button for the Internet, allowing all users to show their approval of certain types of digital content by sending a tip instantly.  He gave the example of Reddit users sending a tip to someone as a type of ""super upvote"" for a post they especially enjoyed. On YouTube, he said users tip creators of videos that they appreciate.  ChangeTip users treat the service slightly differently across platforms, he said. Sullivan said about half of its transactions occur on Reddit and about one-third on Twitter. The other platforms hosted the remaining 20% of transactions.  ""There is no specific standout [source of tips] ... The core emotion being captured is reward and appreciation,"" he said.  Sullivan added that his company would delay a plan to charge a 1% fee for withdrawals from ChangeTip that was due to take effect on 15th January. Fees will not now be imposed until June.  Tipping heats up  Tipping as a service has become an increasingly attractive niche in the bitcoin world.  Bitcoin services provider Coinbase launched its own tipping service today, allowing users to send micropayments to celebrities like Adam Carolla and noted figures in technology like venture capitalist Fred Wilson, who is an investor in the startup.  Coinbase co-founder Brian Armstrong has touted tipping as the sort of activity that could drive bitcoin adoption and develop a new ""micropayments economy"".  ChangeTip has raised $750,000 in two rounds from investors including Cryptocurrency Partners and Boldstart Ventures, according to Crunchbase. It also lists 500 Startups' Sean Percival, RRE Ventures' James Robinson and StockTwits co-founder Howard Lindzon, among others, as investors on AngelList.

42377805,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fTZ,1416345015,KnCMiner Plans 16nm Bitcoin Mining ASIC Launch in 2015,"Cryptocurrency mining hardware designer KnCMiner is planning to deploy its next generation bitcoin ASICs in early 2015.  The Swedish company announced that its upcoming Solar ASIC will be manufactured on the new 16nm FinFET node, allowing for significant performance and efficiency gains.  In a statement, the company said that it would be relying on solutions developed by its engineering team, noting:  ""The 16nm process represents a step change in processing capability as we're using several proprietary techniques developed in-house to reach speeds an order of magnitude above today's levels.""  KnCMiner unveils specs for new ASIC  KnCMiner  became the first bitcoin ASIC designer to launch a planar 20nm chip earlier this year. The first Neptune chips were manufactured a few months ago and the transition to the new process yielded a significant performance improvement over previous generation 28nm chips. The 20nm Neptune features 1440 cores and consumes 0.57W per GH/s.  The new Solar platform is expected to offer a six-fold performance increase compared to KnC’s previous generation 20nm hardware. The gains on the efficiency front are even bigger, as the company said the new Solar chips will achieve 0.07W per GH/s.  KnC’s Solar ASIC features more than 5,000 cores, making it substantially more complex than the Neptune. The 16nm process enables higher densities than the 20nm node, allowing designers to integrate more transistors per square millimetre.  The new manufacturing process also enables higher clocks and superior efficiency, but one can only speculate on the exact figures at this point. KnCMiner does not disclose the names of its manufacturing partners, making it impossible to draw direct comparisons between nodes.  Bitcoin ASICs go 3D  KnCMiner's announcement represents yet another step toward the manufacture of next-generation bitcoin ASIC chip processes amid a broader shift among the chip industry as a whole.  FinFET allows designers to utilise non-planar transistor designs, therefore chips based on the technology are often said to feature 3D transistors. Different chipmakers have different definitions of what constitutes FinFET manufacturing processes, but the aim of all these new processes is the same it has always been – to deliver better efficiency and superior performance.  Intel was the first chipmaker to start employing non-planar 3D transistors in commercially available chips, but these chips are referred to as tri-gate designs rather than FinFET designs. The technological distinction is blurred – although Intel does not use FinFET branding, its 14nm and 22nm chips, namely Ivy Bridge and Haswell generation designs, can informally be described as FinFET chips.  While Intel has been making inroads in the foundry business in recent years, the company does not lease its latest manufacturing processes to third parties. As a result, chip designers have a choice of Globalfoundries/Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) processes.  TSMC’s 16nm FinFET node  (16FF) has already entered risk production and the company described yields as excellent. The company pulled in its 16FF process by roughly a quarter and now expects to commence volume production in the first quarter of 2015. TSMC was originally planning to start volume production in the second quarter.  Samsung and Globalfoundries joined forces for their FinFET push earlier this year. The two companies said they should be ready to manufacture their first 14nm FinFET products by the end of 2014, but the ramp-up comes later, sometime in 2015.  Few potential downsides  One of a handful of downsides of shifting to 16nm FinFET, and indeed every new node, is the potential for low yields. Mature processes do not struggle with yield issues, and these issues tend to take a much bigger toll on complex, large chips such as high-end GPUs. Yield issues mean that manufacturers simply get more faulty dies per wafer, pushing the unit price of healthy dies up.  However, this problem is usually faced when dealing with high-volume chips, as poor yields can quickly erode the chipmaker’s margins. Bitcoin ASICs are a low-volume affair with a very short lifecycle, so any potential issues will most likely be outweighed by superior performance. Additionally, TSMC has made previous claims that its 16nm FinFET yields are good.  Chips built using the latest manufacturing processes also tend to cost somewhat more than those built on mature nodes, but once again the price premium is outweighed by superior performance, even in consumer chips, let alone bitcoin ASICs.

42377828,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fYb,1416331534,Commissioner Claims CFTC Can Intervene in Bitcoin Markets,"A commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has asserted the agency has the authority to take enforcement actions against price manipulation in bitcoin markets.  Commissioner Mark Wetjen made the remarks at a bitcoin conference held at Bloomberg in New York on Monday.  When asked if the CFTC has the authority to become intervene in such an event, he said:  “It has not been tested, but I do believe we have the authority because bitcoin, by I think a very rational reading of our statute, classifies as a commodity and the definition of a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act.""  He added that this gives the regulating body the authority to bring enforcement on any type of manipulative activity, thereby broadening the reach of how a commodity can be defined.  Wetjen also recently spoke out in favour of flexible bitcoin regulation, saying digital currency has become important to the CFTC because bitcoin-accepting merchants have expressed the need to hedge exposures to fluctuations in its value.  Interpreting its policies  The CFTC does not have a “special focus” on bitcoin and it is currently looking at the rule set and understanding bitcoin-related regulatory obligations, as it does with all asset classes.  Bitcoin has created a number of interesting challenges for the CFTC, he said, chief among them being the way it monitors exchanges or swap exchange facilities required to abide by certain surveillance obligations.  “It hasn’t really up until now required us to rethink the policies themselves,"" he said. ""It’s more an issue around interpretation and understanding.”  The agency notably approved the first regulated financial instrument tied to bitcoin in the US, when it gave the greenlight to swap execution facility TeraExchange to launch USD/BTC swaps on its platform in September.  Approaching regulation  The Bloomberg panel on which he spoke discussed a range of issues, including New York's BitLicense proposal, reputational risk associated with bitcoin, negative publicity and overall lack of understanding of cryptocurrencies.  Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, welcomed regulatory efforts launched by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), saying the whole process has been “open and iterative” and that it would be good to have sensible but strong regulation at the state level.  “I am heartened by the fact that we have a state like New York, and other states, that are issuing licenses and trying to think through some of the issues,” she said.

42377808,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fUp,1416320635,Coinbase Launches 'One-Click' Bitcoin Tipping Tool,"Coinbase has officially launched a new micropayments tool that aims to provide websites and blogs with the ability to bolster revenue through online donations.  Called Coinbase Tip, the feature enables the bitcoin services provider’s wallet users to send micropayments to web publishers with just one click.  To begin, the feature will be added to a host of popular blogs, including those penned by television personality Adam Carolla and bitcoin VC Fred Wilson.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Coinbase CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong acknowledged the recent upswing in interest surrounding bitcoin micropayments, praising the already popular micropayments tool ChangeTip as a complementary solution that his company frequently recommends.  Together, Armstrong asserted, such services can enable the bitcoin community to attract more mainstream users, while providing new evidence of just one of the technology’s many use cases.  Armstrong said:  ”We believe there is a new micropayments economy, the beginning of which you’re just seeing and I think it’s significant because this business model just wasn’t really possible before bitcoin.”  One-click tipping will need to first be enabled by Coinbase Tip users, who must authorize the functionality. Bitcoin tips completed via the service are set by default to 300 bits (roughly 10 US cents), but can be adjusted to be as low as 1 cent.  Coinbase  indicated that all tipping will be completed off blockchain and that it will pay the associated miners’ fees on all transactions.  Bitcoin’s network effect  Armstrong said that Coinbase Tip is just one way that his company is seeking to move bitcoin closer to the mainstream, asserting his belief that the tip buttons will help consumers become gradually more aware of bitcoin.  Key to this movement, Armstrong said, will be the use of Coinbase Tip donation buttons on websites that reach beyond popular bitcoin destinations, such as those his company has partnered with for the feature’s launch.  Armstrong acknowledged that consumers are unlikely to flock to the donation button immediately, and that many will likely gloss over the latest addition to their favorite website.  However, he voiced optimism that such a feature would serve as a daily reminder about the technology, explaining:  ""The third or fourth time a friend mentions something about bitcoin, that’s where you reach that critical mass of awareness where they’re saying, 'Maybe I’m missing out on something if I don’t know what this bitcoin thing is'.""  Complicating factors  Armstrong stressed that Coinbase Tip will also function differently depending on how users choose to interact with the service.  For example, while Coinbase wallet users will be able to enable one-click tipping, those who use third-party wallets with Coinbase Tip will need to navigate additional steps.  Despite instilling the service with this competitive advantage, Armstrong stressed that his company isn’t trying to compete with other tipping solutions, such as those provided by rival wallet provider Xapo, arguing that his company’s main goal is to see bitcoin succeed.  “We don’t look at what the competition does around these things,” Armstrong said. “If we can help the bitcoin ecosystem overall, that’s probably where we most want to focus.”  Micropayments take center stage  The latest product from Coinbase also comes at a time when bitcoin tipping is becoming more widespread in the community, with a number of recent articles pointing to alleged uptakes in the use of the platform ChangeTip.  The new grassroots momentum for the service also followed the healthy, $445,000 funding round garnered by dogecoin micropayments tool Dogetipbot.  Armstrong chooses to see these events as part of a broader trend, one he hopes will encourage the wider online community to adopt new behaviors that allow for more sustainable content production.  ""Instead of giving them a thumbs up or emoji icons, it will be more like a thumbs up with a tiny cash payment along with it,"" he explained.

42377804,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fSJ,1416317281,Regulation Takes Center Stage at Bloomberg Bitcoin Event,"The importance of regulation was the topic of the day as industry heavyweights joined current and former regulators at Bloomberg's bitcoin conference yesterday.  Bitcoin: Beyond the Currency, held at the organization's global headquarters in New York, drew an audience of roughly 200, many of whom were investors and other denizens of Wall Street.  Former SEC chairman and recently appointed advisor to BitPay and Vaurum Arthur Levitt told the audience that there is a lot of work still to be done on bitcoin’s image to take it into the mainstream.  “I think a lot of people in the industry think that mainline is something bad,” he said. “It isn’t – there are obvious ways you can do it and one way is to recognize that regulation isn't in and of itself an evil word. It can be a stamp of acceptance, of approval, of having arrived.”  Other panelists echoed the concerns about bitcoin's image problem, but also spoke much more positively about the role of the digital currency in financial services and other uses of the technology underlying bitcoin, the blockchain.  Bitcoin and the blockchain  The first panel, 'Bitcoin as a Technology', featured Chain CEO Adam Ludwin, BitGo CEO Will O’Brien, Ribbit Capital partner Nick Shalek and Blockchain president Peter Smith. Bloomberg Television tech reporter Alex Barinka moderated.  Ludwin kicked off proceedings aiming to dispel any notions that bitcoin and the blockchain could be separated. He addressed the Goldman Sachs report on digital currencies issued earlier this year which expressed interest in the blockchain, but not the digital currency. Smith called it a “fashionable” sentiment in the FinTech community right now.  Ludwin said:  “Everyone is building on both the blockchain and bitcoin. There are very, very few people separating even as you get into things like smart contracts, insurance types of proposals, legal or governance systems – you’re still fundamentally moving the most basic level of bitcoin around.”  He added that, while the world has previously had 'digital abundance' and even 'infinity', the notion of 'digital scarcity' was only introduced five years ago, by bitcoin and its units.  Now that it’s here, he said, there can be digital money or digital value transfer. All outcomes of the flow of capital are wound up and bound to contracts, he added, explaining:  “Once we combine digital scarcity with contracts, which are the programming language of this city – New York City runs on contracts … we can now begin to put that onto a public ledger that has perfect transparency, zero counterparty risk and ease-of-use that you just don’t get when you introduce very high-powered lawyers.”  In their closing remarks, each of the panelists mentioned regulation as at least one of their biggest concerns for the industry going forward.  Notably, O’Brien added that the industry will be “fractionalized” by local regulators and local movements “dislodging” future innovations. Shalek offered the opinion that banks and regulators will spend too much time waiting for the other to take the lead.  Eliminating 'the human element'  Taking part in the 'Payments and Service Providers' panel were Circle co-founder and CTO Sean Neville, Stripe head of digital currencies Christian Anderson, BitPay co-founder and executive chairman Tony Gallippi and BitNet CEO John McDonnell. Bloomberg Intelligence senior financials analyst Alison Williams moderated.  Anderson said that it’s important to “tease apart” regulation and consumer protection, as it relates to “trust brands” – the ones that give consumers the confidence to use products and services.  Consumer protection, he said, can be accomplished without over-regulating trust brands like Visa.  Anderson said:    “The more interesting conversation is going to happen ... around the concern of regulators that criminal activity is going to somehow run through these digital currencies.      The resolution to the regulatory conversation will be regulation that scales with the size and success of the business so it doesn't interfere with innovation on the front end of the funnel.”    Evoking one of Ludwin’s points from the first panel, BitNet's McDonnell said that the answer to consumer protection, money laundering, criminal activity or any other regulatory issue can be automated, calling it the ""recurring theme"" and the ""recurring answer"" throughout the community dialogue.  He spoke of the value of multi-signature transactions that have a service layer that eliminates the need for humans to imbed a smart contract or any other additional feature to do so.  He welcomed, and challenged, the dialogue around regulating technology, saying:  “Give us the regulation, give us the thing you need and we’ll figure out how to collect it – and we’ll do it in an automated fashion. It’s all about the technology, it’s all about automation, and it’s all about eliminating that human element.”  Regulation 'an important factor'  While those on the opening technology panel seemed dubious about bitcoin’s regulatory outlook, the regulators themselves were more upbeat.  Coin Center  executive director Jerry Brito moderated a panel that included former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt, FinCEN director Jennifer Shasky Calvery, Delta Strategy Group founding partner James Newsome and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) commissioner Mark P. Wetjen.  Levitt said that bitcoin has had many reputational issues and received significant negative attention from media events. The problem and challenge for the industry, he added, is defining what it does and what it will be doing 10 years from now – a definition that could turn public opinion in its favour.  “A bitcoin sounds diminutive,” he pointed out. “Cryptocurrency sounds mysterious.” Regulation, he added, is “a terribly important factor in terms of image and reputation.”  Levitt also said his conversations with national regulators, while few, reveal “a real willingness and desire to learn [about] and understand” bitcoin.  For the CFTC, Wetjen said, the biggest issue with bitcoin is around surveillance. It’s important and necessary to understand the technology of bitcoin to understand how a swap execution facility and other similar platforms could abide by regulatory obligations, he said.  At the moment, the CFTC isn’t singling out bitcoin especially, but that it’s looking at all asset classes per its usual responsibilities, Wetjen said, adding:  “How can there be improvements fundamentally is a very, very healthy thing to be discussing, and again, just my entry into the bitcoin world has led to that.”  When asked how they envision the bitcoin landscape five years from now, the consensus was “evolved, accepted and regulated”.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/18/regulation-takes-center-stage-at-bloomberg-bitcoin-event,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f274e662c4cefe75a4e35404df4d87c0c7419a90-600x450.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a blog post presenting his findings, Cubrilovic says 11 dark markets with commercial activity taking place on them remained operational, while their clones had been seized.  ""Some of these sites were mentioned in the FBI press release ... as having been taken down when in fact the clones were seized,"" he adds.  According to Cubrilovic, the markets named by the FBI release that are still trading are Executive Outcomes, FakeID and Fake Real Plastic.  Operation Onymous  was a sweep through dozens of dark markets involving law enforcement agents from 16 European countries and the United States.  Some $1m-worth of bitcoins were seized, along with €180,000 in cash, gold, silver and narcotics. Bitcoin is the de facto currency of the dark markets.  The Onion Cloner bot  One reason for the existence of cloned sites could be the use of a bot called Onion Cloner, which became popular among dark-website operators in May. Dark net addresses are known as 'onion' addresses.  Onion Cloner found and copied dark websites so that its operator could steal passwords or bitcoin transactions, Cubrilovic argues.  Some 133 sites seized by law enforcement were clones, Cubrilovic says, and a large proportion were produced by Onion Cloner. In fact, Cubrilovic concludes that all Onion Cloner sites in existence had been swept up in Operation Onymous.  Cubrilovic, who worked with two associates, also disputes the official figure from law enforcement that 414 dark net addresses were seized. He found 276 seized addresses after independently assessing the extent of dark net seizures.  How law enforcement agents did it  Cubrilovic also offers a theory about how Operation Onymous was conducted. This has been a subject of some concern as it is possible that law enforcement officials have successfully 'broken' the anonymity afforded by the Tor network, where dark websites are run.  The security researcher argued that the large number of cloned websites caught up in Onymous' net suggests that the operation was a ""broad, untargeted sweep"" instead of an effort to nab specific illicit marketplaces.  Therefore, instead of finding a dark market's onion address and then tracing it back to a host server to capture the operator, law enforcement agents appear to have done the opposite – identifying specific hosting companies and then seizing the hidden sites they serve.  Cubrilovic says that he will publish the details of the affected hosting companies. He is also speaking to the hosts in an effort to uncover the techniques used by law enforcement agents in conducting Onymous.

42377813,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73fet,1416306238,Decentralised Apps Promise New Way of Doing Business Online,"One of the social web's dirty little secrets is that nothing is for free. However, decentralised apps (DApps) may be able to make the relationship between service provider and user more transparent – and more flexible.  For years, 'web 2.0' services offered people free services with incredible value. Facebook is one example, and Google is another. People didn't generally have to pay for them financially, but were giving back in other, and sometimes controversial, ways.  The use of people's personal data is one such trade-off, but work is another. Every time you share a status update on Facebook or upload a Vine on Twitter, you're contributing to massive content bases that enhance the quality and value of these companies' services. It's a social contract many users aren't even conscious of.  So when Reddit announced that it wanted to return $5m to its users, possibly in the form of a cryptocurrency, that was a big deal. The company will give something back to users, besides merely its online service. They get a token, with a quantifiable financial value.  What they will be able to do with that token isn't yet clear, but it's likely it will become a form of currency to be used as payment and reward within the Reddit community. There is also a possibility for the value of such a token to shift over time.  This idea of creating tokens for use inside services and applications is relatively new, but the concept is starting to gain traction, and some hope that it will revolutionise online software and services. Welcome to the world of the DApp.  What is a DApp?  David Johnston, co-founder of the BitAngels investment project which funds cryptocurrency-focused ventures, knows a thing or two about decentralisation. Now, he's nearing the end of putting together the first DAPPS Fund, to help kickstart what he sees as a new class of application.  In his GitHub description of DApps, Johnston describes them as open-source applications that generate tokens according to a standard algorithm.  Tokens are used to reward any contribution made to the application, and they are also required to use it. Finally, by Johnston's definition, changes to the app's protocol must be made by majority consensus.  But where is the profit in a DApp, and how does that differ from other application business models?  Tom Ding, founder and CEO of crowdsale platform Koinify, believes that it takes a concept as old as currency and updates it for the 21st century.  Ding said:  ""Before DApps, the only way you could make money from software is either charge for it (keep them secret or limited use), or charge for extra services (redhat model), or sell user information (Google model, most likely still keep it secret or half secret).""  DApps that issue their own tokens draw on the notion of seigniorage, which is the profit that an issuer of money can make by creating money.  Let's say a government spends 22.5 cents to produce and distribute a $20 banknote which will last around 7.5 years. The note costs the bank 3 cents each year over its lifetime. If the bank invests the proceeds from selling someone that note at a return of 50 cents per year, then it will make a profit of 47 cents a year. That's the bank's seigniorage.  A properly engineered DApp could have seigniorage too. Tokens are created based on contribution to the application, and (hopefully) gain value as the network effect kicks in and usage of the application increases. The people that contribute to the application's design, development, or operation accrue tokens, which increase in value.  That's seigniorage at work. No printing banknotes or loading them into vans here, though – it's done using the same basic cryptocurrency concepts that underpin bitcoin.  Bitcoin was the original decentralised app, according to Johnston, who draws on its success for inspiration.  ""Think about the fact that bitcoin, now a $5bn market cap project, and it’s completely open source,"" he said. ""There’s no CEO or marketing department. It’s been self-monetised by its own token. That’s pretty unique.""  The DAPPs Fund  Johnston co-founded the DAPPS Fund in October last year, which earmarked millions in funding for teams participating at hackathons. The money goes to help kickstart the development for these token-based apps.  [post-quote]  Joel Dietz, who founded token-based crowdsale platform Swarm, argues that DApps provide a new way for users of an application to set its price.  ""This idea of a 'tokenizable' market-priced piece of software (or other type of network utility) has extremely high potential,"" he said. ""It could combine the best of both worlds: profitability and collective effort.""  In a DApp model, tokens don't represent equity in the system, says Johnston. They're a different kind of asset class, agrees Dietz. Just as bitcoins have been determined by many regulatory regimes as a commodity or property, they're likely to do the same with tokens, he suggests.  Crowdsale platforms had better hope that the regulators see things the same way, because the SEC is still mulling the equity crowdfunding concept.  Financing innovation  The decentralised application could go a long way towards financing innovation. Dietz suggests that the concept eliminates the need for proximity to angel investors, because they can be anywhere.  Startups could also use tokens to draw resources of other kinds from users, meaning that they may need to spend less on those resources. Bitcoin did it with transactional computing, while MaidSafe did it with storage.  Ding thinks that DApps could lead to innovation in different kinds of industry, based on key characteristics:  ""The more commoditised (ie: an incremental rather than revolutionary model change) an industry is, the more likely it can be disrupted totally with the DApp model.""  Ding puts retail banking, insurance, financial exchange, marketplaces, and content platforms towards the top of the list.  DApps need infrastructure to work. They need a method to produce and document the underlying cryptocurrency, and potentially a decentralised way to document transactions that take place on the app's network. They may also need platforms to sell the tokens in the first place.  At least one of those components may be easily available with no extra work, said Johnston, arguing that bitcoin's own block chain is the best place for many DApps to thrive.  ""In my own estimation, a lot of these technologies won’t have to use a proof of work or proof of stake,"" he said. ""If they build on top of the existing bitcoin blockchain, then they create security. That’s usually the best approach.""  Consumer apps on the way  Notary chain systems like Factom create some of the infrastructure that will allow the bitcoin block chain to support future DApps. Factom lets people document thousands of transactions in a single blockchain hash, a feature those decentralised apps will need.  Swarm and Koinify create ways to crowdsell the tokens underpinning the apps, but they are platforms, aimed at startups and investors. Where are the applications that the average non-technical end-user is going to get excited about?  Johnston said that the first DAPP Fund was necessary to build out the infrastructure, and that more consumer-visible applications will come.  We're already starting to see some, including storage applications like Storj and MaidSafe, while ride-sharing network Zooz will generate tokens that can be used for transportation – and mined by moving.  Gems  , the social networking service for which Koinify will launch a crowdsale on 1st December, will let advertisers pay for its tokens (XGEMs) to place ads and will award them to users of the network who choose to opt into ads.  Going forward  Johnston may have set out a manifesto for DApps, but it's not likely to be a static definition. If this model for distributed applications with thousands of stakeholders takes off, it'll outgrow those predefined characteristics pretty soon.  ""I'm expecting this very young space to evolve very rapidly, and new models will emerge,"" Ding said. ""For example, the separation of payment tokens, control tokens, and ownership tokens."" Token distribution is another area where he thinks innovation will occur.  The chances are that the DApps of tomorrow may look very different to those of today, as people innovate and morph the business model. If the revenue-generation model it creates is as new and innovative as people like Johnston believe, then it could prove to be a platform for disruption.  DApps might also be a way forward for some industries currently grappling with revenue stresses caused by Internet encroachment on established operational models.  In the meantime, Johnston is already planning a DAPPS Fund II for late next year, after all the funds for the inaugural fund have been allocated in early 2015.
