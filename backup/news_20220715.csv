This is because inflation is also being accompanied by a stronger dollar. The better inflation hedge/store of value could be Ethereum since it will soon become a deflationary cryptocurrency. If Bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is digital oil. Thesis Summary Inflation has taken its toll on the stock market and led many investors to seek refuge in inflation hedges. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been touted by many as an inflation hedge, given its scarcity, but its performance appears to be much more closely tied to stocks than commodities like gold. For various reasons, Bitcoin is a must-own, but it will not act as an inflation hedge right now, especially with a rising dollar. Furthermore, I propose that there is an even better hedge against inflation in the realm of cryptocurrencies, and that is Ethereum (ETH-USD) The Bitcoin Inflation Hedge Debate Bitcoin has been made to mimic gold in many ways. The supply is increased by “mining”, a slow process that gets harder over time. Like gold, the supply of Bitcoin is finite, although arguably there are still chances of discovering more hold, while 21 million Bitcoin is all that will ever exist. With that in mind, people often believe that Bitcoin should act as an inflation hedge since gold is perceived as an inflation hedge. However, Bitcoin has been trading much more in sync with the Nasdaq 100 ( NDX ) and “risk-on” assets. BTC and NDX (TradingView) We can see that the performance of BTC and the NDX has been closely linked, especially following the 2020 covid crash. Bitcoin performed best under the covid-induced deflation. So what’s going on? Is Bitcoin like gold or like stocks? Before we answer this, we must look at another key variable. The dollar index ( DXY ) BTC, GOLD and DXY (TradingView) In the chart above, we can see the performance of gold, the dollar and Bitcoin. We can see some correlation, but also periods where this breaks. The strongest ( inverse ) correlation is the one we see between BTC and the dollar. Bitcoin peaked just as the dollar bottomed and has been downtrend as the DXY rallied from 90 to over 108. Gold, on the other hand, rallied strongly with Bitcoin after the covid crash but has since traded sideways. Arguably. It performed okay during 2021 at the same time as the dollar was rising. However, gold has been falling since March as the dollar uptrend has accelerated. Many people seem to be neglecting here that we are witnessing both price inflation and a very strong dollar, which doesn’t make much sense on the surface. Higher inflation is the result of excess cash vs the goods in the economy, which is symptomatic of a “weakening currency”. However, we are seeing inflation and a higher dollar. Why? There are a couple of reasons. Firstly, the dollar is considered a haven. Secondly, the Federal Reserve is increasing rates faster than other countries and is experiencing lower inflation than, for example, Europe. Thirdly, we could see this as proof that inflation today is being driven more by shortages of supply shocks rather than straight-up monetary inflation. Or at least a combination of both. So, while Bitcoin is a “scarce resource”, it is also a currency, and like almost all other currencies, it has been losing ground against the dollar. In a scenario where a weakening currency induces inflation, Bitcoin could be a hedge against inflation, but this is not the case today. Ethereum Could Be The Better Store of Value With the above in mind, I’d like to point out that, amongst the realm of cryptocurrencies, there is a superior alternative to Bitcoin in terms of inflation hedging, and that is Ethereum. As you probably know by now, Ethereum is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, and it currently operates on a Proof-of-Work ( PoW ) consensus mechanism. But this will change following “the Merge”, which will turn Ethereum into a Proof-of-Stake ( PoS )coin. Under PoS, coins are no longer mined but are obtained/created by staking, which involves locking up existing Ethereum. I mention this because this change will make ETH more deflationary. This is because rewards under PoS are a fraction of rewards in PoW. About 5-10x less, according to Tim Beiko , the man responsible for coordinating the work of Ethereum’s core developers. When Ethereum transitions to PoS, less ETH will be created with every block. On top of that, Ethereum recently introduced a burn mechanism under EIP-1559, which was part of the London Hard Fork. Following this update, block sizes were increased, and part of the rewards sent to miners are now being burned. Ultimately, this means that ETH should be a deflationary currency. According to estimates from Ultrasound Money , Ethereum should deflate at a rate of 2% annually following the merge. So, if you are looking for a scarce asset to protect you from inflation, look no further than Ethereum. Not only that, but ETH has a concrete utility within its blockchain. ETH is needed to pay for gas fees to execute smart contracts. If Bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is digital oil, and we know that the latter has performed much better during this period of inflation. Takeaway Cryptocurrencies will not serve as inflation hedges with a strengthening dollar. The scenario in which they become an inflation hedge is when the dollar falls out of favour, something I believe will happen, but not at this point. This is not to say Bitcoin and Ethereum won’t perform well moving forward, only to say that inflation is not the reason. Of the two, Ethereum arguably has more utility, and its supply will dwindle every year, making it perhaps an even better store of value.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | ZRX | FORKS,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4523697-forget-bitcoin-ethereum-is-better-inflation-hedge?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7282.jpeg
7281,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4523696-cleanspark-obscure-bitcoin-miner-could-go-either-way?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1657928598,CleanSpark: This Obscure Bitcoin Miner Could Go Either Way,"Low mining costs provide CleanSpark with a competitive advantage over many of its peers; it may not be enough. If the price of Bitcoin remains subdued for a prolonged period of time, the company could not only survive, but thrive under most Bitcoin price points. Weak crypto environment providing CLSK with low-cost opportunities to expand operations by adding mining capacity. The question going forward is how the company can compete on revenue against its larger competitors. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) is a relatively unknown Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miner competing in the crypto sector. It is undergoing the same struggles its peers are going through as a result of the continual downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin, and the FUD surrounding it. That said, the company has been able to acquire more mining equipment at bargain prices, so if can survive the low-cost Bitcoin environment it's now operating in, when the price of Bitcoin sustainably rebounds, it could potentially leverage the boost in price from the increase in the number of mining machines it employs at that time. In this article we'll look at its most recent earnings numbers and what the future may hold for the company and its shareholders. Most recent earnings numbers Revenue in Q2 jumped to $41.6 million, up more than 4x from the $8.1 million generated in Q2 of 2021. Mining revenues accounted for $37 million of the total. Management attributed much of those gains as a result of investments in infrastructure and mining equipment. The remaining $4.6 million came from its energy segment, which is, in my opinion, increasingly irrelevant to the company; CleanSpark should sell that unit and use the capital for operations. Adjusted EBITDA from the prior quarter reveals how the low price of Bitcoin has had an impact on the company's performance. EBITDA in Q2 dropped sequentially by $1.8 million, as a consequence of Bitcoin prices dropping and higher mining costs. Year-over-year EBITDA was solid, jumping from $1.9 million last year in the same reporting period, to $22.5 million in Q2 2022. For the most part I'm discounting that because of the rapid erosion associated with weak macro-economic conditions and crypto markets.The plunge in the price of Bitcoin from Q1 2022 to Q2 2022 showed itself in the drop in net loss from a positive $14.5 million in Q1 to a loss of $170,000 in Q2. Until the price of Bitcoin sustainably reverses direction to the upside, this should be how the company performs going forward. While the company has been finding some bargains in order to boost the size of its mining fleet, at the same time, once they're deployed, it has also increased the cost of energy. As long as the price of Bitcoin remains subdued, that will be a challenge for the company. As for its balance sheet, the company had about $1.9 million in cash on hand at the end of March. It also held 420 in Bitcoin at the time, with a book value of a little over $17 million. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter stood at close to $90 million. It sold 720 Bitcoin in the quarter to fund operations. Energy costs to mine one Bitcoin is about $4,500. Growing its mining fleet and boosting Bitcoin production In the middle of June 2022, CleanSpark announced it had ""taken over an existing purchase contract for 1,800 Antminer S19 XP units..."" Per its partnership with TMGcore, it includes 257 ""immersion-cooled tanks designed to improve the performance of mining machines while substantially decreasing their failure rates over long-term use."" The company expects the new machines to increase mining capacity by over 252 petahashes per second. On July 14, 2022, the company announced it had acquired 1,061 Whatsminer M30S machines that were already in the process of mining Bitcoin. It stated that is should add another 93 petahashes per second to its mining capacity once the machines are delivered over the next six months or so, starting in August. Over the last six months the company has boosted computing power by 47 percent, with production increasing by about 50 percent during the same time frame. Growing its mining fleet over time has started to pay off for the company, as it mined 339 Bitcoins in June, up from the respectable 312 it mined in May. As of the end of June CleanSpark held 561 Bitcoins, after selling 328 Bitcoins for an average price of $25,644 for a $8.4 million total. That was significantly under the 210 Bitcoins it sold in May for an average of $32,639, where it raised $6.9 million.As of this writing, the company said it has about 28.5k Bitcoin miners representing a hashrate of 2.8 EH/s. Conclusion After sifting through CleanSpark, I see the company as having no real competitive advantage over its peers, with the exception of low energy costs. Even there, the market hasn't rewarded the company for that. That could possibly be because as it adds more mining capacity those costs have been rising. The question I ask is why I should take a position in CleanSpark when there are a significant number of competitors that attract a lot more volume? Among the eight Bitcoin miners I follow and/or have a position in, CleanSpark has the lowest volume, which generates concerns of liquidity. Also, with lower volume it may not be able to leverage the price of Bitcoin as well as its competitors that attract a lot more interest. Concerning the numbers, CleanSpark does okay, but in my mind, it really doesn't differentiate much from its peers, which begs the question of why take a position in the company when there are numerous other Bitcoin miners to choose from with significantly more daily volume? A major reason I see for at least taking a small position in the company is the growing number of mining machines it's putting to use over the next six months. As it gains momentum, if the price of Bitcoin starts to sustainably rise by the end of 2022, CleanSpark would be in great position to leverage the price with its added capacity. At the same time, if the price of Bitcoin takes longer to move up in price, CleanSpark could start to feel a lot of pressure with margins narrowing and revenue, at best, remaining level. For these reasons, I think CleanSpark could go either way in regard to its share price, and it could lag behind competitors if its costs continue to rise and its margins to shrink. As with all Bitcoin miners, CleanSpark will move in correlation to the price of Bitcoin. The question is whether or not that will be enough to compete against its peers. At this time, I'm not convinced it will outperform them, even though it will perform okay when the price of Bitcoin regains its upward trajectory.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4523696-cleanspark-obscure-bitcoin-miner-could-go-either-way?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7281.jpeg

7280,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4523671-coinbase-unfavorable-setup?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1657920875,Coinbase: Unfavorable Setup,"Coinbase saw deteriorating platform metrics in Q1'22 due to a serious decline in cryptocurrency prices in the first half of FY 2022. Coinbase is likely going to see a severe slowdown in (institutional) asset growth going forward. Coinbase is set to submit a very weak Q2'22 earnings card. The decline in EPS estimates is concerning. Coinbase's Q3'22 outlook is likely going to be disappointing which exposes investors to further risks. Significant market uncertainty should be expected to continue to weigh on Coinbase's shares. Shares of Coinbase Global ( COIN ) cratered 79% in 2022 due to deteriorating crypto market conditions and steep declines in prices for crypto assets. As a result, Coinbase Global saw declines in all of its major platform metrics including monthly transacting users, trading volume and net revenues in the first-quarter. Going forward, I believe that investors must expect a slowdown in asset growth on the platform, especially from institutional investors, as well as weaker platform metrics across the board. EPS estimates are also declining rapidly, suggesting that an upwards revaluation -- unless conditions in the crypto markets fundamentally change in the second half of the year -- is unlikely to happen any time soon. Deteriorating crypto market conditions foreshadow an awful Q2'22 Coinbase's platform business was deeply affected by the decline in crypto prices this year. Major digital currencies like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) slumped to new lows in 2022, dragging the entire crypto market down, including the share price of Coinbase. Data by YCharts Because of broad-based declines in cryptocurrency prices, Coinbase is set to submit an earnings card for the second-quarter in August that will likely see a serious deterioration in all of its key platform metrics. Coinbase Global's most important metric -- the number of monthly transacting users on the platform -- saw a significant drop-off of 2.2M in the first-quarter and I expect that second-quarter numbers are not going to be great either. I estimate that the number of monthly transacting users declined another 1.3-1.5M in Q2'22 due to a broad-based slump in cryptocurrency prices. Unless market conditions fundamentally improve in the second half of the year, the user trend is set to stay negative for Coinbase for the foreseeable future. Because MTUs are in a decline, I also anticipate a 15-20% decline in revenues compared to the first-quarter and continual platform losses. Coinbase Prepare for a cyclical decline in institution-driven asset growth on Coinbase Global Coinbase's retail customers generated total revenues of 965.8M in Q1’22 while institutions, which are more buy-and-hold investors, generated just $47.2M in revenues. Retail traders accounted for 95% of the firm’s transaction revenues in the first-quarter and they will remain key to Coinbase's platform profitability. Over the longer term, however, Coinbase is likely going to woo institutional investors more by building out its blockchain service and custody businesses. Retail traders are driving Coinbase's transaction revenues, but institutions have historically driven the platform's asset growth. But, with crypto asset prices decreasing as rapidly as they did so far in 2022, including in the second-quarter, institutions may adopt a ""wait-and-see"" approach and reduce their capital commitments to the crypto space going forward... which could then result in a serious asset drawdown from Coinbase. Institutional assets declined to $134B in Q1'22 and the second-quarter will likely have seen a steep drop-off in this metric as well. While I expect that retail traders will continue to dominate trading of cryptocurrencies, the asset side of Coinbase's platform business may suffer severely in FY 2022. For the second-quarter, I expect a 10% drawdown in asset values on the Coinbase platform with both retail and institutional investors seeing declines. Coinbase Global Coinbase has seen steep declines in EPS estimates Coinbase’s earnings prospects and platform profitability depend to a large extent on (retail) trading activity. Because of the decline in crypto prices, earnings estimates for COIN have also declined rapidly. Coinbase is now expected to generate negative EPS in FY 2022 and FY 2023 which is a dramatic reversal from positive EPS predictions at the beginning of the year. If market conditions continue to deteriorate, there is a risk that EPS estimates will continue to trend downwards in FY 2022. Data by YCharts Expect a weak outlook for Q3'22 Because of the broad-based weakness in cryptocurrency prices and negative user trends, Coinbase is set to submit an outlook for Q3'22 in August that is likely going to be less than inspiring. A weak user and revenue outlook in and of itself may be a reason for many investors to give up and sell their shares in the cryptocurrency exchange, adding to existing pressure on Coinbase. Risks with Coinbase Global Besides EPS risks and volatile platform profitability, there are other risks. The biggest commercial risk for Coinbase right now is the possibility of a prolonged crypto winter which would most likely result in severe declines in the number of users, trading volume and assets on the platform. Additionally, bankruptcies are spreading in the crypto sector: indebted crypto lender Voyager Digital recently filed for bankruptcy while BlockFi was sold to crypto exchange FTX in a $25M fire sale . While crypto exchanges are safer than lenders (which have credit risk), the entire industry may be set for a painful period of restructuring. Coinbase has already announced that it will lay off 18% of its workforce to account for the possibility of a crypto winter. Also a risk: More challenging market conditions could pressure Coinbase's fee structure. With prices trending down, customers that trade consistently become more valuable. Coinbase has one of the highest fees in the industry and is vulnerable to rivals offering zero-fee trading to attract new customers. Binance just rolled its zero-fee trading program out to its global customer base which is a threat to Coinbase. Final thoughts Coinbase is not much more than a “hold” now that EPS predictions have completed collapsed. User, asset and platform trends are negative and indicate that the platform will submit a very weak earnings card for the second-quarter and outlook for Q3'22... which could drive a further down-ward revaluation of Coinbase's shares. With risks of a recession increasing, digital asset prices may continue to face considerable headwinds. While I believe in Coinbase's platform and growing density of products and services, the short term outlook has deteriorated quite dramatically!",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4523671-coinbase-unfavorable-setup?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7280.jpeg

Specifically, Circle's reserve assets were supported by $13.6B in cash and $42.1B in 3-month Treasury bills with an average expiration of 44 days, its unaudited report showed as of June 30. The company's total reserve assets held on behalf of holders of USDC ( USDC-USD ), which is designed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar, stood at $55.7B, up slightly from 54.9B coins in circulation. Its cash pile was held at a slew of U.S.-regulated financial institutions, including Bank of New York Mellon ( BK ), Citizens Trust Bank, Customers Bank ( CUBI ), New York Community Bank ( NYCB ), Signature Bank ( SBNY ), Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Capital ( SI ) and U.S. Bancorp ( USB ), according to the report. Circle's move to enhance its disclosures comes as it ""continues to increase our transparency based on new industry innovations and what USDC holders within our ecosystem would like to see,” CFO Jeremy Fox-Geen said in the blog post. In a backdrop of the growing financial contagion effect in the crypto market stemmed from collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUST ( UST-USD ) and its sister token Luna ( LUNA-USD ), ""we are working toward providing daily disclosure as well as securing permissions from our custodians to disclose the amount they each hold,"" Fox-Green said.

That compares with a record $12.5B invested during the first half of 2021, the same year in which major cryptos like bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) peaked at all-time highs. Despite the slump in funding, which mirrors that of the broader technology space, deal flow rose to 534 deals in H1 2022 vs. 456 in H1 2021, Crunchbase highlighted. Looking at second-quarter numbers, though, over $4.2B was deployed to venture-backed crypto startups, which held strong from the slightly less than $4.2B figure in Q2 of last year, Crunchbase noted. Still, that reading is down about $1B from Q1 and from a record $6.1B in Q4 2021. As momentum of the financial contagion effect in the cryptocurrency market keeps growing, consumer-oriented vehicles like non-fungible tokens (""NFTs"") and blockchain-based games have taken a hit. “Ultimately, I view that as a good thing long term, as it cleanses out the noise and focuses more on the utility/real entertainment function that these tokens (and) NFTs unlock,” said Yash Patel, general partner at Telstra Ventures, which has a stake in Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX, as quoted by Crunchbase. “Similar to the Web2 world, games and digital art are meant to be fun, not burdensome financial instruments.” Note that OpenSea, one of the world's largest NFT marketplaces, recently laid off 20% of its workforce in the wake of crypto winter as well as ""macroeconomic instability.""

42422726,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p1Bh,1657916448,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Erases Weekly Losses, but Skepticism Remains","Hi, I'm Jimmy He, here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  Bitcoin (BTC) climbed for a third consecutive day, erasing this week’s early losses.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose 1.5% over the past 24 hours and was recently trading at about $21,000.  Some analysts are still wary of bitcoin’s surge amid a market that’s averse to risk, with inflation hitting a 40-year high on Wednesday and the troubled crypto lender Celsius Network filing for bankruptcy on Wednesday.  Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote that bitcoin’s recent resilience doesn’t necessarily mean a further recovery.  “The near-term outlook is still a concern given the broader risk environment and reports of bankruptcies in the industry,” Erlam wrote. “If anything, the latter could be a bigger concern if [bitcoin] does eventually break lower.”  The U.S. dollar index (DXY), a measure of the greenback relative to a basket of foreign currencies, is approaching highs unseen since 2002, Glassnode wrote in a newsletter.  The rise is driven by either a strengthening demand for USD-denominated fixed-income securities as the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates or the depreciation of foreign currencies such as the euro, which recently dropped to a 20-year low of $1.0002 against the dollar.  The DXY has a predominantly negative correlation with bitcoin prices, and so further index increases could spell price declines for the cryptocurrency.  Most altcoins were in the green, with QNT leading the charts, up 13% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) was up 4.6%.  Today’s edition of Market Wrap was produced by Sage D. Young.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $21,116 +2.1%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,266 +5.8%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,850.77 +1.6%      ●Gold: $1,703 per troy ounce −0.1%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.93% −0.03       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Slumping Mining-Rig Prices Offer Bitcoin Miners the Opportunity to Buy for Cheap  Bitcoin mining-rig prices slumped to nearly two-year lows as Celsius Mining filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday alongside its parent company, Celsius Network.  The mining unit had filed a confidential S-1 draft registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March to take the company public and said last year that it had invested $500 million in its North America bitcoin mining operations.  Now, Celsius Mining is selling its rigs at a heavily discounted rate per terahash (TH).  “A person familiar with the situation told CoinDesk that Celsius Mining auctioned off thousands of its newly purchased mining rigs in June, with the first batch of 6,000 selling for $28/TH and a second group of 5,000 changing hands at $22/TH,” Aoyon Ashraf reported.  According to Luxor Mining’s hashrate index data, mining rigs were trading at around $50-$60/TH in June, double Celsius’ auction price.  A Glassnode report last month showed bitcoin miners’ total revenue had fallen 57% since the cryptocurrency’s all-time high while network difficulty had risen by 132%.  “This substantial jump in difficulty suggests that existing miners have expanded their operations, and new miners have joined the network despite a massive income reduction. As such it is likely that recent capital expenses on mining hardware and facilities could add continued pressure to miners’ balance sheets,” Glassnode wrote.

42422720,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p0zh,1657910173,Paraguayan Senate Passes Bill Regulating Crypto Mining and Trading,"Paraguay's Senate approved a bill regulating crypto mining and trading on Thursday.  In December, the country’s Senate had already approved the bill, but in May the Chamber of Deputies passed it with modifications. Therefore, it returned to the upper chamber.  Now approved by both chambers, the law must be submitted to the executive branch, which has the power to approve or veto it.  The main modification proposed by the Chamber of Deputies and accepted by the Senate is that the primary law enforcement authority will be the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which will penalize those individuals or legal entities carrying out mining or providing services with crypto without the corresponding authorization.  The National Electricity Administration will be in charge of enabling the energy supply, and the Secretariat for the Prevention of Money or Asset Laundering will supervise the whole investment process carried out by crypto companies. The National Securities Commission will be in charge of the commercialization of the obtained assets.  The law stipulates that individual and corporate miners have to request authorization for industrial electricity consumption and then apply for a license. It also creates a registry for any individual or legal entity aiming to provide crypto trading or custody services for third parties.  Congressman Carlos Rejala, one of the bill’s authors, told CoinDesk last year that the law looks to attract international miners using the low electricity rates of the country, which are around 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  Canadian bitcoin miner Bitfarms (BITF) is one of the large mining players operating in Paraguay, with a 10 megawatt facility in the city of Villarica, located in the south central part of the South American country.

The funding will largely go toward hiring, Empiric co-founder Karl Oskar Schulz told CoinDesk in an interview.  Other participants in the round included data partners Alameda, CMT, Flow Traders, Gemini and Jane Street plus ecosystem partners StarkWare and Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal, among others.  StarkNet, a zero knowledge (ZK) rollup product addressing scalability issues for the Ethereum blockchain, was created by StarkWare, which reached an $8 billion valuation following a $100 million funding round in May. Empiric Network, co-founded by Schulz and Jonas Nelle, was developed in a strategic partnership with StarkWare.  Decentralized oracle  A blockchain oracle connects smart contracts with the outside world to retrieve or send out information. Traditional oracles are centralized, meaning off-chain nodes go out and find data from multiple undisclosed sources and aggregate that data off of the blockchain. The result of the data, such as a cryptocurrency price or the readout of a sensor, is the only publicly visible item.  The lack of transparent data has raised concerns about centralized oracles, however. For example, errors with two data sources last September led to the Pyth Network oracle incorrectly reporting that bitcoin had crashed to $5,402.  “[Centralized oracles] you can kind of see, like Bank of America lending and borrowing. It works. You can trust it,” said Schulz. “But it’s not like Aave and Compound where the entire contract is on-chain. You can audit it.”  Empiric Network wanted to go to the underlying sources of decentralized data: cryptocurrency exchanges and large market makers. The startup signed partnerships with some of the biggest names in the industry – many of them investors in the current funding round – to bring their proprietary data on-chain.  StarkNet advantage  The centralized oracle structure was more practical from a technological standpoint, avoiding the high gas, or transaction, fees and slow throughput of the main blockchain. StarkWare’s creation of StarkNet provided lower fees, improved transaction speeds and the ability to perform on-chain computations.  On-chain computations open the path to move decentralized finance (DeFi) metrics beyond price feeds and toward the types of data valued in traditional finance, such as risk, volatility and yield metrics.  “Let’s give DeFi the data it needs to really mature and become better. And that’s computational data,” said Schulz.

Rather, the market is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week on many exchanges. Although cryptocurrency markets are open 24/7, liquidity levels might vary based on the time of day.

42393969,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwbEn,1657905107,A DAO for Diseases: How Vibe Bio Plans to Retool Biotech Funding,"The past two years have seen a series of fascinating and strange experiments with a (maybe) innovative organizational structure: decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs. A new startup thinks the structure is perfect for tackling one of the thorniest problems in biotech: funding research into rare diseases.  DAOs were conceived as early as 2015 as largely automated entities executing business logic on the blockchain – hence the “autonomous” tag. That sci-fi goal is still in the future, but in the meantime DAOs have instead become a much more human-centered collaborative structure, leveraging the speed and access of cryptocurrency networks to both gather and deploy capital from large, scattered groups of people. Often, those are for altruistic or social purposes, including projects for Ukraine relief and the notorious ConstitutionDAO, respectively.  One biosciences veteran says DAOs are the perfect structure for addressing the skewed incentives around rare diseases.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal news in crypto. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “A biotech or pharma company has a wealth of technology that can be applied to any number of diseases,” says Alok Tayi, founder and head of a new DAO-inspired biotech initiative, Vibe Bio. “But [big pharma companies] focus on the largest diseases they can pursue with that technology. An organization has to focus on the top one or two to maximize [investor returns].”  Read more: Bitcoiners Are Biohacking a DIY Coronavirus Vaccine (2020)  Vibe Bio wants to change the incentive structure by attracting patients and families directly affected by rare diseases into the drug funding and research process. For Tayi, it’s a deeply personal mission. He spent 16 years as a lab researcher before becoming a biotech entrepreneur. And he has all-too direct experience with rare diseases.  “Unfortunately, our daughter was born very sick, and spent a lot of time in the hospital suffering,” he said. “One of the facets of being in the NICU [Neonatal Intensive Care Unit] with a sick loved one is that you end up spending time with other families with sick loved ones, including many suffering from rare diseases.”  “The obstacle for all of us was that there wasn’t the funding to advance research. The challenge in finding a potential cure is not finding it, it’s funding it … Many of these families are relegated to either the generosity of billionaires or running a bunch of bake sales.”  Further, Tayi said, just because such research isn’t economical for a hulking conglomerate doesn’t mean it’s inherently unprofitable.  “Rare diseases, though the patient population is small, the economic opportunity is still there,” said Tayi. “Your costs are substantially lower because you don’t need thousands of patients” to conduct studies, for instance.  That means the effort could become sustainable over the long term.  “We want to make sure whatever capital is put to work … [the returns] go back to the treasury to be reinvested,” said Tayi.  Bottom-up approach  Broadly, Vibe Bio proposes a much more bottom-up approach to funding and choosing research targets. It has raised an initial $12 million seed round from 6th Man Ventures, angel investor and prescient COVID-19 forecaster Balaji Srinivasan and others to fund preliminary legal and organizational work. But Vibe aims to build an unusually broad community of patients, researchers and advocacy groups who would help drive research decisions and perhaps drive or contribute funding through a Vibe token system.  Read more: Balaji Srinivasan, The Man Who Called COVID (2020)  For now, the starting point is patient advocacy groups, which already work to create visibility for rare diseases.  “[Groups] come to Vibe as part of our community,” said Tayi, “with proposals to fund a potential treatment. Then the scientific side of the community can then review those proposals for things like safety and regulatory protocols. Based on that review, those scientists can rank the proposals for funding.”  “Once the community has authorized capital for a particular proposal, we set up a C-corp that pursues [that project],” Tayi said. “That C-corp is jointly owned by the DAO and the [patient] advocacy organization. We believe the advocacy group to be a secret sauce. We want to give them unprecedented control over the development of a candidate medicine.”  Vibe Bio’s novel structure would also leverage the decentralization of bioscience itself over the past two decades. According to Tayi, biotech is becoming plug-and-play, or “virtualized,” in much the same way software development has.  “You can hire in executive staff for a particular biotech company to develop [a drug] or even build up a pipeline. In biotech, you can do that with a much leaner staff … You can have a dozen or even half a dozen people, who may or may not even be full time. This model has been proven out over decades.”  There are still some details to be determined, including precisely how communities will interact with Vibe Bio, the role of tokens and the overall legal structure. Tayi admits he and his legal team are still working through the nuances.  That’s because he started with a problem, then discovered a DAO could be the solution – rather than, as is too often the case, deciding to launch a DAO and then searching for a problem to fit the structure.  “We didn’t start Vibe because we’re passionate about DAOs,” Tayi emphasized. “The DAO became just a natural construct.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,David Z.

42421484,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUiz,1657904400,CeFi Broke. But DeFi Is Not Without Blame,"There’s a hopeful meme going around crypto circles in the wake of the recent crypto meltdown.  Here’s Bankless writer Donovan Choy’s version in the headline of a newsletter column that tells us “CeFi Broke. DeFi Didn't.” Here’s Pantera Capital CEO and founder Dan Morehead declaring that “DeFi worked great” as he takes a Wall Street Journal reporter to task for erroneously lumping the struggling centralized finance lenders Celsius, BlockFi and Voyager Digital into the decentralized finance camp. And here’s ShapesShift founder Erik Voorhees explaining that although we saw DeFi “prices falling,” there were few signs of “systems breaking.”  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Like much of what counts for debate in this industry, this take is partially correct but also misleading.  Yes, the centralized structure of the failed lenders was a key part of those various CeFi lenders’ undoing. They had rehypothecated the assets that customers had deposited with them – taking custody in the process – creating a mass of IOUs that could not be met once the value of those re-invested loans dropped and all that leverage had to be unwound.  By contrast, people who lent tokens to DeFi projects such as Maker and Aave were – for the most part – protected by smart contracts that automatically redeemed the loans or collateral when needed. As Bankless co-founder Ryan Sean Adams pointed out, the reason why CeFi projects are not collapsing is because “the code is forcing them to pay back their loans. Not laws. Not attorneys. Not courts.”  But the linkages between DeFi and CeFi’s failures are much tighter than this narrative lets on. It’s not only that Terra, the failure that started it all, was a DeFi project. It’s also not just that, for DeFi users, the collapse in DeFi token prices amounts to more or less the same thing as losses from loan defaults, or that billions of dollars have been lost in scams and “rug pulls” engineered by DeFi founders.  The real problem is the interrelationship among the inflated yields that DeFi projects were offering, the unsustainable “number go up” expectations for token prices on which those yields were based and the entire interconnected complex of CeFi and DeFi speculation that emerged out of all of that.  Fixing the entire system  DeFi has much to offer the world of finance. That DeFi smart contracts worked as promised in these highly stressed market conditions to keep intact the “systems” – if not the prices – is a good proof of concept on which to build a more robust, viable system. When you remember how, in scandal after scandal, Wall Street’s centralized intermediaries have bilked the global financial system for more than a century, it’s easy to see benefits of markets, rather than opaque gatekeepers, setting prices and rates.  But as it’s currently designed, DeFi is highly volatile and prone to all sorts of manipulation. In the first quarter of 2022, before the worst of the market collapse, $1.3 billion was lost to scams and hacks across Web3, according to a report from Immunefi, a bug bounty and security provider for DeFi services.  It doesn’t matter how decentralized the model for asset custody and loan repayment is – if a project’s code has vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit or if the price of the underlying tokens is prone to dropping precipitously in short periods of time, it’s hardly viable as a competitor to the existing system.  Read more: Michael Casey - LTCM and Other History Lessons for Crypto  Work is needed, in other words, to bring security and stability to DeFi.  As we discussed last week, it could do with some real-world, return-generating use cases so that yields are founded on something concrete rather than the arbitrage opportunities created by speculation and outsized upward price projections. And as we discussed three weeks ago, it’s time to work out a viable regulatory framework that would include both official regulation and self-regulation in ways that don’t undermine the benefits of decentralization.  DeFi’s outperformance over CeFi during the market’s massive leverage unwind offers a welcome building block with which to design a more secure system of regulation and investor protection.  Where there is deemed to be a truly decentralized control, that system should focus on code audits, bug bounties and rigorous testing rather than impose compliance on leaders who have given up control over their systems.  For CeFi players, we should call them as they are and demand the same degree of regulation that’s applied to established intermediaries in traditional finance.  The interrelationship between these different realms needs to be understood if the entire system is to work. Dismissing one and focusing on the other will leave crypto finance projects vulnerable to repeats of the recent ugly episodes.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Michael J.

Jared Huffman of California and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts requested those agencies require greater emissions and energy use reporting from the crypto mining industry.  “The results of our investigation … are disturbing … revealing that [crypto miners] are large energy users that account for a significant – and rapidly growing – amount of carbon emissions,” the lawmakers said in a statement. “Our investigation suggests that the overall U.S. crypto mining industry is likely to be problematic for energy and emissions,” they added.  The lawmakers said the top seven mining companies have presently developed over 1,045 megawatts (MW) of energy capacity for their mining operations – enough to power all the residences in Houston, the largest city by population in Texas. The group is further alarmed by miners’ plans to increase capacity by nearly 230%, enough to power another 1.9M households.  They also noted that much remains unknown about the full scope of mining activity and requested the two agencies work together to require reporting of energy use and emissions from crypto miners. The group asked for a response from EPA and DOE by Aug. 15.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining and ESG: A Match Made in Heaven  This isn’t the first time the lawmakers have urged federal agencies to look into energy consumptions of the crypto miners. Previously, Huffman and 22 members of the Congress sent a letter to the EPA raising their “serious concerns” about how bitcoin (BTC) mining is polluting communities and having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.  However, in response to that letter, a group of major bitcoin investors – including MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) Michael Saylor, Block’s (SQ) Jack Dorsey and miners such as Core Scientific (CORE) – authored a letter in May, defending bitcoin mining and discussed the many misconceptions about environmental impacts.  The emissions issue has been debated widely, and among recent actions by U.S. policymakers was the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposing that all publicly traded companies report greenhouse-gas emissions from their operations in addition to the amount of energy they consume. The mining industry mostly welcomed the move, hoping to shed light on efforts at using renewable energy sources.  There have also been moves at the state level, with New York’s Senate passing a moratorium impacting bitcoin mining in the state. It’s not a ban of proof-of-work mining per se, but a two-year freeze on starting new bitcoin mining facilities that rely on carbon-based fuel.  Read more: New York Mining 'Ban' Is a Green Opportunity  The mining industry has been vocal against lawmakers' push to curb energy usage. The Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC) – a voluntary global forum of bitcoin mining and other companies in the industry – said that its survey found recent improvements in use of sustainable power mix by the miners and technological efficiency.  The global mining industry’s sustainable electricity mix is now 58.4%, claims the BMC, and the global Bitcoin network’s technological efficiency grew by 63% year over year. “This efficiency gain reaffirms the fact that as the Bitcoin network continues to grow, it will become even more efficient over time,” said the BMC.

42422744,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p6nh,1657902237,The Fall of Celsius Network: A Timeline of the Crypto Lender’s Descent Into Insolvency,"After a months-long battle with insolvency issues, crypto lender Celsius Network has initiated bankruptcy proceedings. Celsius is the third major crypto company to file for bankruptcy within the past two weeks as plummeting crypto prices buffeted by inflationary pressures and volatile market conditions cause consumer confidence in the industry to nosedive.  Here’s a timeline of events leading up to Celsius’ move to file for bankruptcy:  April 12, 2022: Celsius Network shows its first sign of distress by announcing its U.S. platform will begin holding non-accredited investors’ coins in custody, where investors will no longer be able to add new assets and earn rewards on Celsius’ Earn platform.  “As we previously have acknowledged, Celsius has been working closely with regulators around the world. It is our intention to be as transparent with our community as possible,” the company said in a blog post. “More specifically, we have been in ongoing discussions with United States regulators regarding our Earn product. As a result, there will be changes to the way our Earn product will work for users based in the United States.”  May, 2022: Algorithmic stablecoin terraUST (UST) and sister coin LUNA implode in a $40 billion collapse, disrupting the cryptocurrency market and spurring $300 billion in losses across the cryptocurrency economy.  The implosion of LUNA and UST damages consumer confidence in the crypto market, accelerating the onset of a “crypto winter” and an industry-wide sell-off that spurs a bank run-style series of withdrawals by Celsius users.  Later, in its bankruptcy filings, Celsius attributes its liquidity woes to “the domino effect” of LUNA’s collapse.  June 12, 2022: Celsius freezes withdrawals, swaps and transfers in response to “extreme market conditions,” fueling rumors that the platform has become deeply insolvent. The company reveals no timeline to restore user services, stoking fears among the platform’s 1.7 million users that their assets will remain frozen indefinitely.  June 30, 2022: Celsius hires restructuring expert Alvarez & Marsal to explore the firm’s options to mitigate the fallout of its mid-June swoon.  “Across Celsius today we are focused and working as quickly as we can to stabilize liquidity and operations, in order to be positioned to share more information with the community,” the firm wrote in a blog post.  July 3, 2022: Celsius lays off about 23% of its workforce, a month after pausing user withdrawals and transfers, as the company faces mounting liquidity issues.  ​​""We are operating with the entire community and all clients in mind as we work through these challenging times,"" Celsius wrote in a blogpost.  July 7, 2022: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) aggregator KeyFi files a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court, alleging Celsius engaged in market manipulation and failed to implement basic accounting controls to protect user deposits.  That same day, KeyFi CEO Jason Stone takes to Twitter to accuse Celsius of lying about its lack of investment strategy and oversight.  “They had not been hedging our activities, nor had they been hedging the fluctuations in crypto asset prices,” Stone tweeted. “The entire company’s portfolio had naked exposure to the market.""  Stone also accuses the firm of operating like a ponzi scheme and cheating him out of potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in pay.  July 12, 2022: Celsius' wallet transfers $8.4 million in Circle’s USDC stablecoin to DeFi lending protocol Aave, closing Celsius' loan and freeing up the remainder of tokens pledged as collateral against Celsius’ debt, including some $10 million in stETH, a derivative type of the ether (ETH) token, $13 million in Chainlink's LINK tokens and $3 million in Synthetix's SNX.  July 13, 2022: Celsius Network files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.  “Today’s filing follows the difficult but necessary decision by Celsius last month to pause withdrawals, swaps and transfers on its platform to stabilize its business and protect its customers,” the company wrote in a statement. “Without a pause, the acceleration of withdrawals would have allowed certain customers – those who were first to act – to be paid in full while leaving others behind to wait for Celsius to harvest value from illiquid or longer-term asset deployment activities before they receive a recovery.”  July 14, 2022: A court filing from Celsius' advisory partner Kirkland & Ellis reveals Celsius has a $1.3 billion hole in its balance sheet. The filing marks the first time Celsius has acknowledged the hole in its balance sheet.  This is a developing story.

42422759,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p7Hh,1657899401,Ethereum’s Merge Projected for September According to 'Soft' Timeline,"Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation projected this week that the Merge – Ethereum’s long-anticipated transition to a new design – might take place the week of Sept. 19.  The Merge will see Ethereum switch from the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism brought to the fore by Bitcoin to a more efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) system. In addition to slicing the network’s energy use by 99.95%, some proof-of-stake proponents believe that switching mechanisms will introduce security and scaling benefits.  Beiko, an Ethereum protocol support engineer, made his September estimate at a PoS Implementers Call. In addition to offering a potential date for the Merge, Beiko gave a timeline for other major Ethereum development milestones.  Though he offered a rare hard date for the Merge, Beiko has repeatedly noted – on Discord, Twitter and an Ethereum community Zoom call – that the timeline is very likely to change.  What is the Merge?  Today’s PoW mechanism, whereby miners compete to secure the network by solving complex computational puzzles, is the consensus algorithm that secures the Bitcoin blockchain, but it has been criticized for its high energy costs.  PoS – versions of which have already been adopted by chains like Solana and Tezos – replaces miners with validators. Validators can stake 32 ETH with the Ethereum network for the chance to get randomly selected to add blocks (bundles of transactions) to the chain.  In both PoW and PoS, adding blocks to the chain typically grants some rewards to the block issuer.  The update from PoW has been on Ethereum’s roadmap since it first launched in 2015, but engineering complexities have caused the shift – originally dubbed “Ethereum 2.0” – to drag out several years.  The Merge is not expected to reduce Ethereum’s relatively high fees and slow transaction speeds, but it will have a significant immediate impact on the network’s energy use.  Last week, Ethereum’s Sepolia testnet successfully switched to PoS. Goerli, the third and final of three public testnets, will run through the Merge process on Aug. 11. The parameters that trigger the test will be determined in the next Ethereum Foundation All-Core Developers call. These testnet merges, which served as sort of dress rehearsals for the real thing, each take developers one step closer to Ethereum's mainnet PoS upgrade.

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: BTC holds the $20,500 level and DeFi tokens continue to surge. A new court filing showed that Celsius acknowledged a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet.  Market Moves: Omkar Godbole looks into why DeFi tokens are rallying and whether traders think it will be a short-lived rally or not.  This web version of today's First Mover newsletter was produced by Sage D. Young.  Price Point  The crypto market got off to a good start on Friday morning, with bitcoin (BTC) trading up 5% on the day, at $20,800 and all other assets higher.  Liquidation levels for BTC are currently at 5:2 in favor of short rekts, meaning an upside rally has been favored over the last 12 hours, according to Hashdex’s head of Europe, Laurent Kssis.  “An upside above $21,000 can be tested should the short liquidations continue to be triggered and we could then test the $22,000 mark,” said Kssis. He added that a cautionary stance remains as any further negative news will keep BTC under pressure and below $20,000.  AAVE was up 16.5% over the last 24 hours and Solana’s SOL was up by 12%. The QNT token of the Quant Network, which automates trust functions between multiple blockchains, was trading up 20% on the day.  On Thursday UniSwap’s UNI was listed on Robinhood’s (HOOD) crypto trading platform and has since rallied 11%. The decentralized exchange's ERC-20 token boasts a market capitalization of about $4.7 billion, and had about $394 million in trading volume.  The recent rallies in altcoins and BTC’s rise have brought the entire crypto market capitalization up to $928 billion, trying to approach the $1 trillion mark again.  Meanwhile, Celsius acknowledged a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet Thursday, according to a new court filing from the company's advisory partner, Kirkland & Ellis. The news came after the ailing crypto lender filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday.  Some analysts are seeing a bright future for Celsius’ CEL token, despite the lender's recent downfall. The token could recover in the future despite the current actions of its management team, some traders are saying. CEL was up 20% on the day.

DeFi outperformance a flash in the pan  Observers were unsure if the rally in the decentralized finance (DeFi) majors would be long-lasting, given the fundamentals remained weak.  ""Sure, we see some rally in the DeFi coins for now, but fundamentally nothing has changed. The total value locked has been destroyed,"" crypto financial services firm Amber Group said, while noting the absence of large buying.  ""We have seen some institutional mandates scooping up majors and DeFi blue chips, but it's not like massive amounts,"" Amber's trading desk told CoinDesk.  The total value locked in the DeFi protocols has crashed to $38 billion from $95 billion this year. And there was hardly an uptick as of writing, according to data source DeFi Pulse. The total value locked is the amount of user funds deposited in the DeFi protocols and is one of the most commonly used metrics to assess the sector's growth.  Other indicators, such as the volume of bitcoin locked in DeFi and the number of addresses lending and borrowing in DeFi protocols, pointed to a continued slowdown in the activity.  ""The volume of wrapped bitcoin participating in DeFi protocols is a clear indicator of the DeFi momentum among more traditional crypto investors,"" Jesus Rodriguez, CEO of the analytics firm IntoTheBlock, wrote in an DeFi analysis piece published Tuesday. ""Recently, that indicator has dropped to a near all-time low, signaling a slowdown in the DeFi activity among bitcoin holders.""

EquitiesFirst, which was founded in 2002, began offering crypto collateralized loans in 2016.  “EquitiesFirst is in ongoing conversation with our client and both parties have agreed to extend our obligations,” the firm told CoinDesk.  Celsius began borrowing from EquitiesFirst in 2019. Two years later, Celsius was asked to repay a loan by EquitiesFirst in order for the collateralized crypto to be returned only to be told that it could not be delivered in a ""timely basis,"" according to the report.  EquitiesFirst is currently repaying $5 million per month, and the debt is made up of $361 million in cash and 3,765 bitcoin (BTC), worth nearly $79 million at the time of writing.  Details of the debt first emerged in Celsius' bankruptcy filing on Thursday, in which it revealed that it had liabilities of $5.5 billion and $4.3 billion of assets.  The shortfall may increase as $600 million of Celsius' assets is locked up in the now depleted CEL token, which is trading at $0.80 despite hitting an all-time high of $8.04 last June.

This company is considered a subsidiary of Terraform Labs in South Korea. Kwon Do-Hyung, also known as Do Kwon, the CEO of Terraform Labs, is the only internal director of FLEXE Corporation. Traced Cash Flows Totalling 6 Billion Won After visiting the listed address and learning the company didn&apos;t have a real presence there, the broadcaster declared that the subsidiary was an inactive paper corporation. Authorities claim to have traced cash flows totaling 6 billion Korean won (about 4.5 million dollars) and 12 billion won (roughly 9 million dollars) that originated in Singapore and traveled through the British Virgin Islands before arriving at FLEXE in South Korea and other Terra affiliates. A former Terraform Labs employee claimed FLEXE caused problems in a specific tax examination on the company last year. KBS stated the subsidiary was used as a route to acquire payments from liquidated cryptocurrencies. By publication, neither Terraform Labs nor Kwon had responded to the media.

Markets across the board and across the world are in the red, and the bitcoin and crypto ones are no exception.

Using ARK Invest&apos;s latest Bitcoin Monthly report as a guide, let&apos;s go through the tragic sequence of events and evaluate the bitcoin market as it stands. According to ARK, the road to the bear market went like this: &apos;Beginning with the Terra collapse in early May, contagion spread to major crypto lenders including Blockfi, Celsius, Babel, Voyager, CoinFlex, contributing to the insolvency of the once highly-respected hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Since Terra&apos;s collapse, total crypto market capitalization has dropped ~$640 billion.&apos; Nevertheless, there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel. &apos;Promisingly, however, recent fallout (Babel, Voyager, CoinFlex, Finblox) appears lower in magnitude compared to Terra, Celsius, and 3AC.&apos; That doesn&apos;t mean the end of the bear market is near, nor that capitulation is already over. Especially if the Mt. Gox victims receive the rumored 150K BTC. First, let&apos;s follow ARK as they analyze two of the main players in this drama.

42422765,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0p7Lh,1657877706,"DeFi Coins Outperform Bitcoin, Ether as Traders Pare Bets on Jumbo Fed Rate Hike","The crypto market traded higher at press time, helped at least in part by traders scaling back expectations for a 100 basis point (1 percentage point) hike in borrowing costs by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this week.  In the lead were major decentralized finance (DeFi) coins, boasting double-digit percentage growth in 24 hours and outperforming market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  Cryptocurrency lending platform Aave's native coin, AAVE, was up 15% at $91. Last week, AAVE proposed a decentralized yield-generating dollar-pegged stablecoin GHO to expand services offered on the platform. GHO is likely to generate additional revenue for the Aave decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) by sending 100% of interest payments on GHO borrowing to the DAO, the proposal said.  Decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap's UNI traded at $7, representing a 13% gain. Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, changed hands at $20,660, up 3.5%, while Ethereum's ether token was priced at $1,200, up 8%. Other notable gainers were programmable blockchain Solana's SOL cryptocurrency, privacy-focused coin monero, Polygon's MATIC, cosmos and algorand.  Rates traders saw a 49% chance that the Fed would deliver a full percentage point interest rate hike on July 27, a significant decline from 80% seen after the release of Wednesday's consumer price index (CPI), an indication of inflation or deflation, according to data tracked by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's FedWatch tool.  The repricing of the probability lower began later Thursday after Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the ""markets may have gotten ahead of themselves"" in pricing in a 100 basis point rate hike for July.  However, Waller said he supports a 75 basis point rate hike later this month and may consider a bigger rate hike if the retail sales and housing data paint a positive picture of the economy.  Due Friday at 12:30 UTC, or 8:30 a.m. ET, the retail sales data is likely to show that consumer spending increased by 0.9% in June. The housing data due on July 19 could show housing starts tumbled 14.4% in May, while building permits dropped 7%.  DeFi outperformance a flash in the pan  Observers were unsure if the rally in the DeFi majors would be long-lasting, given the fundamentals remained weak.  ""Sure, we see some rally in the DeFi coins for now, but fundamentally nothing has changed. The total value locked has been destroyed,"" crypto financial services firm Amber Group said, while noting the absence of large buying.  ""We have seen some institutional mandates scooping up majors and DeFi blue chips, but it's not like massive amounts,"" Amber's trading desk told CoinDesk.  The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols has crashed to $38 billion from $95 billion this year. And there was hardly an uptick as of writing, according to data source Defi Pulse. The total value locked is the amount of user funds deposited in the DeFi protocols and is one of the most commonly used metrics to assess the sector's growth.  Other indicators, such as the volume of bitcoin locked in DeFi and the number of addresses lending and borrowing in DeFi protocols, pointed to a continued slowdown in the activity.  ""The volume of wrapped bitcoin participating in DeFi protocols is a clear indicator of the DeFi momentum among more traditional crypto investors,"" Jesus Rodriguez, CEO of the analytics firm IntoTheBlock, wrote in an DeFi analysis piece published Tuesday. ""Recently, that indicator has dropped to a near all-time low, signalling a slowdown in the DeFi activity among Bitcoin holders.""  The percentage of bitcoin's circulating supply tokenized on Ethereum and locked in DeFi fell to a near record low of 50.6% on July 8 and was last seen at 50.8%, data tracked by IntoTheBlock shows.  Rodriguez cited the decline in the number of addresses borrowing and lending to a 12-month low as another indicator of ""DeFi winter,"" along with a drop in the number of loans above $100,000 and transaction costs on Ethereum.  Explaining broader market resilience  The crypto market's remarkable show of strength since Wednesday's CPI release has analysts scrambling for an explanation.  Amber said traditional and crypto markets were short while heading into the CPI release. Bitcoin, for one, fell to $19,200 from $21,600 in the three days leading up to the inflation data published on Wednesday. Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index dropped more than 250 points early this week on fears an elevated inflation would compel the Fed to suck off liquidity at a faster pace.  Perhaps, a potential ugly inflation figure was priced in advance, allowing for some stability since the data release.  ""What's helping now is perhaps the absence of further massive liquidations,"" Amber's trading desk said. ""The crypto market was slammed from the previous CPI [released on June 13] till now and massively underperformed traditional markets during that period.""  And while several indicators say the bottom is in, the probability of the market witnessing a quick bull revival appears low, thanks to the worsening outlook for global economic growth, persistently high inflation and continued Fed tightening.",POSITIVE,AAVE | BTC,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/15/defi-coins-outperform-bitcoin-ether-as-traders-pare-bets-on-jumbo-fed-rate-hike,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7cdb893bf2f8cf56aaa0af766082a54d754c51a-1707x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Times reported that BVI-based Teneo has hired Singapore-based WongPartnership LLP to petition the High Court for provisional relief that would allow Teneo to administer Three Arrows’ assets in the city-state and subpoena co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies.  If Teneo’s lawyers are successful, Teneo would be able to secure Three Arrows’ assets in Singapore for the hedge fund’s creditors, lawyers who spoke to The Times said.  One route that lawyers could take is to examine what fault the founders had in the fall of Three Arrows.  Should the liquidators be able to prove that the collapse of Three Arrows was due to the mismanagement or misconduct of its co-founders, there might be a pathway to pursue seizing their assets for the benefit of creditors, lawyers said.  Zhu is in the process of selling a house worth close to S$50 million (US$35 million), CoinDesk reported, and has a number of properties under both his and his wife’s name.  Three Arrows’ over the counter trading desk, TPS Capital, is said to be cash-rich and will likely be included in the lawyers’ application.  It is not known when the court will make its decision.

Past Performance of COMP As mentioned in our previous analysis, the breakout rally in COMP prices sustained above the broken trendline and the selling pressure near the $55 resistance level results in a retracement to retest the trendline.

Even though APE is now trading at a premium of 6.5% over its initial price on Friday, its performance still pales in comparison to other altcoins. As of this writing, APE is trading at $4.69, a decrease of 3.5% in the last 24 hours, according to data provided by Coingecko on Friday. APE reversed the downtrend on the 4-hour chart after reaching $3.06 in the previous month. Nevertheless, the price encountered numerous obstacles at the $5.3 and $5.5 levels and became sluggish from there. APE is now reevaluating the $4 support. Suggested Reading | Avalanche Notches Solid Mid-Week Bounce - Can AVAX Sustain The Positive Noise? Further Downturn In The Offing For ApeCoin? ApeCoin is approaching a standstill, which could initiate a reverse. Due to the possibility of a further decline in the market value of APE, investors must be wary of the downturn, which has the ability to disrupt the gains and cause further weakening.

Celsius Seems To Be In Big Trouble The document filed to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York shows that Celsius holds $4.3 billion of assets and $5.5 billion of liabilities. That means Celsius is $1.2 billion short and insolvent. In some ways, this confirms rumors that FTX refused to &apos;rescue&apos; the project after seeing a loss of this magnitude. Celsius is one of the several firms that have been hit hard by the ongoing liquidity crisis in the crypto sector.

Key Technical Points: XMR prices have increased by 7.06% in the last 24 hours. The market price takes a bullish exit from the falling wedge pattern in the daily chart. The 24-hour trading volume of Monero is $104 Million, indicating a rise of 17%.

It has now established its support level at $6.30, however, the coin has been trading very close to that support level. After it broke below the $6.66 support line, the coin has spiralled downwards. It retested the $6.30 level the past month. Technical outlook for the coin displayed build up of bullish pressure. The price of the altcoin has remained sandwiched between the $6.58 and $6.30 levels over the last trading sessions respectively.

The funding values 5ire at $1.5 billion, arguably making it both the world's first blockchain unicorn with sustainability at its core and the fastest growing blockchain in India, it said. 5ire's business model is to embed the for-benefit paradigm by highly incentivizing practices that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), CEO and co-founder Pratik Gauri said. The company calls the implementation Proof-of-Benefit.  Gauri added that 5ire will empower decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and working groups to help accelerate the implementation of the U.N.’s 17 SDG goals.  Sailesh Hiranandani, the founder and chairman of Sram & Mram, said 5ire's blockchain is one that ""governments and large corporations will use"" in the near future, giving the example of Malaysia.  ""The Far East is very proactive and keen on adopting blockchain, like Malaysian Immigration and The Health Card app,"" Hiranandani said in an email. ""We feel entry into the market with a layer 1 partner which is sustainable is ideal and 5ire being a sustainable blockchain is perfect for us. This will benefit our group to communicate on blocks as we deal with various countries and have offices in over 8 countries,"" said Hiranandani.  Sram & Mram comprises 10 companies across more than 35 locations. Its interests include agriculture, artificial intelligence, hedge fund management, media and publishing, hospitality and IT.  Gauri founded 5ire in August 2021 with fellow Indians Prateek Dwivedi and Vilma Matilla. Gauri and Dwivedi, friends for more than a decade, came up with the idea at an Indian tea shop writing the first thoughts down on a napkin, he said.  The company embodies the fifth industrial revolution, Gauri said, adding that ""the secret sauce of our idea is to not use Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Work but instead reward sustainable behavior by using Proof-of-Benefit.""  The company raised $21 million in its seed round by October with participation from Alphabit, Marshland Capital and Moonrock Capital among others.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/15/5ire-raises-100m-to-fund-expansion-of-sustainable-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/627b286c15a28898395cf335ef2b887e34f3bb79-1137x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
