NASDAQ has been using blockchain for years to complete and record private securities transactions. More companies are also using blockchain cryptocurrencies in Initial Coin Offerings to raise funds. An ICO launching on December 7 for Fortitude Ranch is not to fund new blockchain application (like the vast majority of ICOs to date), but to apply blockchain technology.The most important blockchain application at Fortitude Ranch is to keep their membership database absolutely secret. Fortitude Ranch is a recreational and survival community. The first rule of prepping is don’t tell anyone you’re a prepper. When a disaster strikes, you do not want to be overwhelmed with neighbors or relatives begging for food and ammo, or besieging you to take them with you to your survival location. Many also are concerned about Big Government knowing they have survival capabilities. Preppers prefer to keep the fact that they have survival plans and a “bug out” location secret. The security of blockchain is also vital for the membership database because it contains the authentication pass codes of members that must be transmitted to Fortitude Ranch locations daily over the Internet.Other blockchain applications at Fortitude Ranch include voting on new Fortitude Ranch locations and policy changes, and of course using the Ethereum blockchain for the issue of their new “Fortitude” cryptocurrency token. The advance sale of Fortitude Ranch memberships will fund expansion from two existing sites to a dozen sites across the United States, and an international location. Buying a Fortitude, gives you a discount price on Fortitude Ranch membership, protection from membership price increases, and priority in joining FR when there is a waiting list.The later feature of this token, priority to join when a wait list forms, is especially important, because in normal times, most people are not Preppers. During a major crisis or media reports on developing threats, demand for membership in Fortitude Ranch will likely surge beyond capacity, and the price of Fortitudes may spike since those desperate to get in will need Fortitudes to have first place in line.We are “coining” the term “Initial MemberCoin Token,” IMO, rather than ICO, to emphasize that this is a utility token with no profit share or equity features that invite securities regulation problems. Pure utility tokens can avoid the securities regulatory risks of ICOs that do offer profit sharing.IMO Advisors include Charlie Shrem, a bitcoin pioneer and COO of Jaxx digital wallet, James Barry, a former IBM executive and blockchain expert, and Larry Hall, the CEO of Survival Condo, the most successful survival services company.Fortitude Ranch (FR) is a large survival community equipped to survive any type of disaster and long-term loss of law and order, managed by full time staff. FR is affordable because of large numbers of members and economies of scale. FR is especially attractive to join because it doubles as a recreation/vacation facility as well as a survival retreat. Members can vacation, hunt, fish and recreate at FR’s forest and mountain locations in good times, and shelter at FR to survive a collapse.Unlike most ICOs for startup software development projects with low odds of success, FR is an established, market tested, proven company.

The price of ether, ethereum's native token, is closing in on record highs above $400.  Soon before press time, the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had hit $413 – a whisker short of ether's all-time high of just over $414 set in mid-June.  As per CoinMarketCap, the ether-U.S. dollar (ETH/USD) exchange rate has appreciated by 12.61 percent in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, ETH is up 24 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is up 43.33 percent.  As detailed in CoinDesk's previous update, it looks as though ETH is still celebrating reports of upcoming access to its own regulated derivatives market.  Meanwhile, comments on social media indicate investors are busy assessing the impact of the surge in transaction volume in the last 24 hours. Ethereum is reportedly processing more transactions a day than all other cryptocurrencies combined.  And, of course, it can't be hurting that billionaire Mike Novogratz commented yesterday that ether could hit $500 by the end of the year.

This morning, the bitcoin cash-U.S. dollar (BCH/USD) exchange rate clocked an 11-day high of $1,623.80 at 08:14 UTC before losing some momentum.  At press time, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market value is currently changing hands at $1,508 – up 21 percent for the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap.  A look at the exchange data indicates that the rally is being fuelled by Korean desks. Trading volumes in BCH/KRW pair offered by Bithumb, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, have gone up by 42 percent in the last 24 hours.  Driving the rise may be today's news that a South Korean financial regulator has said it has ""no plans"" to regulate cryptocurrency trading.  Meanwhile, the total trading volume for the last 24 hours is well above $4 billion, the highest since Nov. 13. A high volume rally indicates an active market, and that a rally is likely to be sustained.  The price action analysis, too, suggests the rally could be extended in the near-term.  4-hour chart  The overbought nature of the relative strength index (RSI) could be responsible for the pullback from previous highs above $1,600.  However, the 5-MA and 10-MA are curving up in favor of the bulls. On the daily chart, the moving averages (MA) are sloping upwards as well.  The daily RSI, though close to the overbought territory, is well short of the highs seen in earlier this month.  View  The base appears to have shifted higher to $1,250.  Technical pullbacks could run out of steam around $1,250  BCH looks set to take out resistance at $1,550 (horizontal red line) and move higher to $1,800-$2,000 in the near-term.

The group, Blockchain at Berkeley, announced the new research partnership yesterday, stating that the two groups would be looking at aspects of trading, such as diversity, strategies and sustainability, specifically within KyberNetwork's early-stage exchange model.  The two entities have drawn up a three-month roadmap that will see them determining potential problems and coming up with solutions, according to a press release.  Kyber's chief executive and co-founder, Loi Luu, said:  ""We see the power of [decentralised exchanges] to influence adoption of the technology by mainstream users. Berkeley students, energetically focused on innovation and creative problem-solving, are an excellent group to help extend KyberNetwork's ideas and creative energy.""  While centralized exchanges use the orderbook model to eliminate trading risks, decentralized alternatives do not.  According to the release: ""The exclusion of orderbook in Kyber Network's model means that the calculated price of these tokens have to be very precise in order for the exchange to stay competitive while keeping the risk of reserve depletion low""  To counter this factor, Kyber stressed the importance of maintaining a reserve for the exchange, as well as monitoring the value of its inventory and maintaining accurate prices.  For the research parameters of the project, the team will consider four parameters: how long it takes to rebuild the reserve, how many tokens each user can transact with simultaneously, tokens prices and lock-up times for reserve contributors.  The research partnership will encompass students, faculty, employees, researchers, engineers and others to develop concepts, undertake the research and ""transform concepts into reality in measurable ways,"" according to the statement.  Back in August, Luu argued that centralized exchanges are potentially unable to handle liquidity well, touting decentralized trading platforms as a better alternative.  However, he added, decentralized exchanges are not as user-friendly as centralized options, and may not have the funds to support mass trading due to small numbers of users.  U.C.

A move to fresh all-time highs above $8,300 earlier this week has been followed by consolidation in the range of $8,000-$8,300.  At press time, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is at $8,161 levels. According to CoinMarketCap data, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has depreciated by 1 percent in the last 24 hours.  While BTC is holding above the $8,000 mark, the upside is being capped around $8,300.  The muted trading conditions could be in part due to the Thanksgiving holidays in the major markets of Japan and the U.S. Further, concerns about the financial health of Bitfinex, one of the largest exchanges, are possibly having an influence.  However, the investor community does not appear too concerned about the Bitfinex issue and is instead assessing the impact of the rally in bitcoin cash (BCH) and ethereum (ETH) prices on bitcoin. Comments on social media indicate investors are expecting the number one cryptocurrency by market value to feel the heat of rallies in alternative currencies like BCH and ETH.  More immediately, the price action analysis indicates scope for a healthy pullback, although the broader outlook still remains bullish with fans of bitcoin predicting a $10,000 price by years' end.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows:  Rising channel as represented by higher highs and lower highs on price, coupled with falling tops on the RSI (i.e. bearish divergence).  The 50-MA and 100-MA are curled up in favor of the bulls, suggesting a pullback could be short-lived.  View  A break below the rising channel support level of $8,020 could yield a pullback to $7,600 levels. Further losses are unlikely as the 10-day MA ($7,800) is curled up in favor of the bulls.  Bullish scenario: A rebound from the channel support, followed by a move above $8,300 would open the door for a rally to a new record high around $8,550 (rising channel resistance).

42428151,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL68ph,1511434814,US Defense Bill Could Give Big Boost to Blockchain,"An obscure provision tucked into a defense spending bill could serve as a springboard for blockchain adoption across U.S. government agencies.  Part of a larger bill called the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Modernizing Government Technology Act (MGT) will allow the public sector to redirect cost savings (which normally must be returned to the Treasury Department) into internal working capital funds that can be used to upgrade their IT systems.  It authorizes agencies to use the working capital funds for modernization projects that fall into one of three buckets: cybersecurity, migrating legacy systems to the cloud and ""other innovative platforms and technologies.""  As such, while blockchain is not explicitly mentioned in MGT's text, it fits into the letter of the law's parameters and objectives to advance the technology beyond the proof-of-concept stage at the agency level.  Based on what U.S. government officials have said in the past, Trey Hodgkins, senior vice president of public sector at the Information Technology Industry Council in Washington, D.C., told CoinDesk:  ""Blockchain was clearly one of the technological capabilities that Congress meant for agencies to look at, and what they were trying to do was create dollars with some flexibility to them so that agencies would have their own discretion on what they invest in.""  Far from being held up in legislation, however, the MGT could soon have an impact. The NDAA has been passed by both the House of Representatives and Senate, and is awaiting President Donald Trump's signature, at which point it would become law.  Blockchain catalyst  Companies looking to provide enterprise blockchain services to the public sector echoed Hodgkins' optimism that the act could provide a pathway toward increased funding and experimentation at the governmental level.  ""We are excited about the MGT Act because it provides incentives to federal agencies to move away from high-cost, low performing legacy systems toward new technologies, like blockchain and smart contracts,"" said Todd Miller, U.S. markets lead at ChromaWay, a hybrid blockchain database provider in the process of opening a Washington D.C. office.  Jeremy Wilcox, managing director for public sector at technology consultancy ClearEdge Partners, said the act could be a ""catalyst"" for the technology, even if agencies were to only redirect a small percentage of the funds toward blockchain.  The flexibility afforded by the MGT could also give agencies some workaround to a congressional appropriations process that has been marred by political logjam.  Rather than passing annual budgets, Congress, in recent years, has passed a series of appropriations bills that temporarily extend what was authorized in the prior period. This dynamic has hamstrung agency's efforts to secure funding for technology upgrades.  ""Sadly, it's a completely dysfunctional process, and for newer technologies, it's really challenging to get an agency to the point where they have the ability to plan for and design and architect, and then go out and buy something and then deploy it,"" said Hodgkins.  MGT could change that dynamic by giving agencies more discretion in deciding which technology upgrades to pursue and how to go about paying for them.  Speaking to this flexibility, Wilcox told CoinDesk:  ""They won't have to go to Congress and say, 'Can we have a line item for blockchain in our budget?'""  Hurdles remain  But even though the MGT provides a window of opportunity for blockchain within government ""modernization"" projects, the technology must demonstrate it has utility at an enterprise level before agencies can fully embrace it.  While cloud computing and relational databases are proven in their reliability, their capacity to scale and their ability to replace existing legacy systems at a large organization like a government agency, blockchain solutions still have a ways to go in demonstrating that same level of credibility.  Government agencies are, after all, still grappling with the cybersecurity risks associated with blockchain.  In a separate section, the NDAA stipulates that the Pentagon monitor government agency adoption of blockchain for cybersecurity risks and provide a briefing to Congress within 180 days.  The bill states the Secretary of Defense must provide Congress with: ""[A]n assessment of the use or planned use of such technologies by the Federal Government and critical infrastructure networks.""  This briefing must also include assessments of the technology’s use by foreign powers and criminal and extremist groups, but also ""a description of potential offensive and defensive cyber applications of blockchain technology and other distributed database technologies.""  The latter item displays the government's interest in taking advantage of blockchain technologies unique features to modernize cybersecurity practices.  ""If blockchain is tied to modernization then it could be a part of that solution,"" said Wilcox, concluding:  ""Time will tell. It's going to come down to what solutions or services are delivered.""
