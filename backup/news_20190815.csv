42430845,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyFzh,1565906435,Privacy Coin Beam Conducts First Hard Fork Away From ASICs,"At 19:00 UTC today privacy coin beam completed its first scheduled hard fork at block 321,321.  Launching on bitcoin's tenth birthday in January this year, beam is one of the first two implementations of the Mimblewimble privacy protocol. Beam’s fork adjusted the mining algorithm due to ASIC mining concerns as laid out in its road map.  Speaking with CoinDesk, CTO Alex Romanov said beam is on track with its initial goals. Romanov said the algorithm made beam more efficient and scalable:  “The new algo, BeamHash II is about 30% more efficient then Beam Hash I. In the fork we have also added support for Laser Beam (Lightning Network version in Beam). We have also added mandatory proof of work for SBBS messages and mandatory fee depending on amount of outputs and kernels.”  Beam’s hard fork against ASICs, or application-specific integrated circuits, mirrors similar efforts by other cryptocurrencies, like privacy coin monero which hard forked in March over similar concerns.  Some cryptocurrency developers see ASICs as an unfair advantage for other users and often, in the name of decentralization or democratization of mining, have pushed for algorithms everyday laptops can run.  Beam’s hard fork occurred mere hours after a small donation from beam to grin, a frenemy privacy coin which shares the same Mimblewimble protocol. Romanov said the teams are friends and, interestingly, they have no contact with other privacy coin teams.  Going forward, Romanov says the foundation is focusing on the consumer side following a miner-focused hard fork. On the to-do-list includes atomic swaps, confidential asset development, hardware wallet integration with Trezor, and general wallet improvement.

The disclosure on August 8th came just a few days after the exchange announced the signing a deal with CertiK to undertake a security validation and amid a rush in the Korean crypto market to up standards and lock down platforms.  According to the announcement on the website, candidates for listing will have to meet nine criteria.  These include requirements for ""a sound business model,"" with a mid and long-term strategy and a clear vision. They also require a solid coin distribution plan and a transparent governance structure. The exchange will also judge the potential candidate on its marketing plan and communications with investors, the announcement stressing that both online and offline interaction are important.  Coinone will review the potential market size of the candidates, checking whether the growth of the project will be limited or could be constrained in the future. The tokens must be usable, with a balance of supply versus expected consumption, and they must have a strong leadership team. After listing, Coinone will review the extent to which the coin's roadmap has been followed and its benchmarks achieved.  Coinone also provided a breakdown of possible reasons for delisting from the exchange. These include market manipulation, lack of transparency, disorderly trading and criminal activity. The exchange will also hold projects accountable for technical deficiencies, such as blockchain failures and insufficient product development, and will be on the lookout for the lack of continuity, especially when it comes to the makeup of the management team.  The exchange will give warnings first, and if it doesn't see improvements, delisting will follow.  Coinone, which was founded in 2014 and had early support from Kakao, is one of the three largest South Korean crypto exchanges and number 70 globally by reported volume, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Its recent 24-hour volume was valued at nearly $90 million, the majority in bitcoin.

42430850,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyG5h,1565895644,"Judge Blasts Craig Wright's Evidence, 'Inconsistent' Testimony in Kleiman Trial","US Judge Beth Bloom has denied a request by Craig Wright to scuttle a lawsuit filed against him because of his past testimony and his credibility before the court, according to a court filing from August 15.  On April 15, Wright filed a motion challenging the Southern District of Florida’s jurisdiction over an ongoing lawsuit pursued by the estate of Wright’s former business partner, the late Dave Kleiman.  Kleiman’s brother Ira alleges Wright has transferred 1.1 million bitcoin, approximately $11 billion at press time, under his control through fraudulent contracts, emails, and business relationships. The lawsuit, first filed in 2018, has resulted in back-and-forth claims between the two sides and a combative court appearance by Wright himself.  Wright has claimed in the past to have invented bitcoin through the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, a claim that has been attacked by numerous critics. Wright, in turn, has pursued legal action against such critics, though in recent days a court tossed out a suit filed against investor Roger Ver.  Wright argues that the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the proceedings, because an entity oversight was granted on Florida-based W&K Info Defense Research, a now defunct firm, had a foreign national as “director.”  Specifically, Wright cites Uyen Nguyen, a Vietnamese national, as outside the jurisdiction of the court. Wright previously claimed not to have had contact with Nguyen since 2016.  Bloom's denial  In her motion, Judge Bloom states that Wright “failed to provide any credible evidence showing a lack of diversity.” She continued to explicate contradictory evidence Wright put forth showing Nguyen’s relationship to W&K.  Bloom provides five statements where Wright obfuscates the ownership structure of W&K. At varying points he said that only Kleiman owned W&K, that he and Kleiman split ownership, and that “he has ‘no idea’ who the owners… were.”  She calls Wright’s argument for dismissal “novel,” as “he seems to argue that even though his numerous conflicting statements are the very reason confusion has been created… the Court should nonetheless use these statements as a basis to challenge the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction.”  ""In weighing the evidence, the Court simply does not find the Defendant’s testimony to be credible,"" Bloom wrote.  'Tangled web'  Now, Bloom said, Wright insists that “three additional parties may be members of W&K,” and these persons and entities destroy jurisdiction.  After a “careful review,” Bloom found Wright’s evidence for supporting this claim that Nyugen, his ex-wife Lynn Wright, and the liquidated firm Coin-Exch were party to W&K as insufficient.  In particular she found emails, purportedly between Wright and Kleiman, as well as business registrations submitted as evidence, as “extremely speculative.”  In paragraph break, Bloom notably quotes Sir Walter Scott’s Marmion:  “Oh! What a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.”  Further, Bloom states that that federal district courts in fact “have subject matter jurisdiction over civil actions where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.00 and the suit is between citizens of different states.”    3244f635-07da-40e1-b8f0-fb87c478df11 by CoinDesk on Scribd    Image via CoinGeek YouTube",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/15/judge-blasts-craig-wrights-evidence-inconsistent-testimony-in-kleiman-trial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73b1f586b36aae79b064dba1dfa2b90558295a04-2560x1525.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430835,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyFdh,1565887518,Maryland Targets Trading Platform Fraud as It Joins 'Cryptosweep' Effort,"Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said Wednesday that the state’s securities market watchdog will become part of an international effort to crack down on cryptocurrency related fraud.  The state is the latest to join “Operation Cryptosweep,” an initiative led by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). As part of the second wave of the operation, 35 enforcements have been taken and nearly 100 more are pending to date.  According to the Maryland’s top enforcer, the number of cryptocurrency-related scams has climbed recent months. Accordingly, the Maryland Securities Division has taken an enforcement action against a crypto promotion scam promising 150 percent returns on investments.  Last week, Texas officials announced they have taken 4 emergency actions against crypto firms since June.  Both governments attribute the surge in malicious initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto-related investment products to the rising price of bitcoin and the publicity that followed Facebook’s move to launch a cryptocurrency called Libra.  “Cryptocurrency investments are risky. Investors should be extra cautious when dealing with promoters who claim their offering does not have to be registered with securities regulators,” Frosh said in a statement.  He continued to say “returns of 150 percent are as rare as Bigfoot,"" a reference to the platform Maryland is moving to sanction. The division has also created a help line and educational video service that breaks down key crypto concepts for consumers.

The malicious code was identified by researchers at data security firm Varonis when investigating a crypto-miner infestation at a ""mid-size company.""  ""Almost every server and workstation was infected with malware. Most were generic variants of cryptominers. Some were password dumping tools, some were hidden PHP shells, and some had been present for several years,"" the firm said.  However, one miner stood out – Norman, as the team dubbed it.  Norman's payload has two primary functions: execute its XMRig-based crypto-miner and avoid detection.  After injection, it overwrites its entry in explorer.exe to conceal evidence of its presence. It also stops operating the miner when the PC's user opens Task Manager (see image below). Re-injecting itself once Task Manager is not running.  The miner element of the malware is based on the openly available XMRig code hosted on GitHib. However, Varonis found that its monero (XMR) address is blocked by the mining pool it links to, and hence is effectively disabled.  The researchers further found a PHP shell, possibly linked to Norman, that ""that continually connects to a command-and-control (C&C) server."" Web shells can allow remote access to a system on which they are installed.  However, the team found that, when they ran the code, it entered a loop awaiting commands and none had been received at time of writing.  The report also notes that Norman may have been created in France or a French-speaking nation. ""The SFX file had comments in French, which indicate that the author used a French version of WinRAR to create the file,"" said Varonis.

From 600 early-stage users, MoonRekt has grown to more than 37,000 registered players – albeit if some were enticed with free HXRO, tokens native to the platform.  The game initially allowed users to bet HXRO, worth about 5 cents, on whether bitcoin’s price will rise or fall within a 5-minute window. Though the game is steeped in crypto’s ironic swagger, referring to price swings as MOON or REKT, the stakes are real.  Now, players will be able to bet the far more valuable cryptocurrency, bitcoin.  “As professional traders, we want to create a platform that mimicked the high-energy experience in the pits of the largest global derivatives exchanges,” said Rob Levy, Hxro’s president and co-founder.  Up the ante  “Our goal is to eventually become the preeminent alternative venue for playing cryptocurrencies, and we expect to add additional token protocols as demand for them reaches a critical mass,” said Hxro CEO Dan Gunsberg, in a statement.  The team also plans to launch a game that simulates portfolio construction, called MUHBAGS. A company representative said, players will compete against one another as “fantasy traders” to see who can build the best portfolio.  Additionally, according to a statement, the company plans on expanding the number of bonuses and rewards on offer, which will be a boon to users of HXRO tokens.

Led by Los Angeles-based M13 Ventures, Republic Labs, Gumi Crypto and early Uber investor Shervin Pishevar contributed funding, according to a statement made August 15.  According to a company representative, the financing comes amid a period of 50 percent growth month over month since April. Additionally, according to internal metrics, nearly 10 percent of customers become repeat purchasers, and fewer than 4 percent of Coinmine One mining devices are returned.  “We could be cash positive if we wanted to,” the representative said. Instead, the company looks to reinvest its earnings and employ the seed financing to build out its business.  The company plans to hire engineers with the capital. This team will build new features and expand the option to mine more cryptocurrencies for the hobbyist-level miner.  “[T]his latest round of financing will help us accelerate our mission of getting more people to experience how easy it is to earn Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” said CEO Farbood Nivi. Indeed, Nivi said the product is built to be an entryway to crypto.  The machine is operable from Android and iOS mobile apps and updates over-the-air automatically, “like a Tesla.”  The company also reports the machine’s energy consumption dropped 30 percent.

42403150,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf4iN,1565874015,Ripple to Give Away 1 Billion XRP in Massive Bid to Fund Online Content,"San Francisco-based fintech company Ripple continues to pump XRP into a growing ecosystem of adjacent startups – despite an ongoing legal complaint alleging that XRP is an unregistered security.  Announced Thursday, Ripple’s investment arm, Xpring, participated in the $4 million seed round for the in-browser payment processing startup Coil, spearheaded by former Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas. (Thomas and Ripple were the sole participants in the round.)  Xpring also announced Thursday that it gave a 1 billion XRP grant (worth roughly $265 million at today's price) to Coil for help building a community of “creators, consumers and strategic partners,” according to a press release. The XRP granted to Coil came directly from “Ripple’s balance sheet of XRP,” according to Xpring Vice President Ethan Beard.  The funding has catalyzed an ambitious growth plan for Coil, including a $20 million investment in storied photo-sharing platform Imgur and an undisclosed amount in the video streaming startup Cinnamon.  The Coil platform allows subscribers to pay $5 a month so that when users consume content from a Coil-compatible website, the content creators – like musician Riley Q and the XRP-enthusiast blogger known as Hodor – automatically receive XRP payments or fiat bank transfers via dollars. Riley Q told CoinDesk she’s earned $3,400 worth of XRP so far.  “Some of our top creators are earning thousands of dollars a month already,” Thomas told CoinDesk, declining to specify how many users there are or the value of transactions facilitated.  Coil relies on the Interledger protocol, which Thomas told CoinDesk in May will eventually support cash-out options for other cryptocurrencies. With regards to the digital media empire Coil hopes to attract, Thomas said:  “Our dream is that you get one subscription and can browse the whole web and support the creators you enjoy without ads or paywalls.”  However, for now, content creators are still in short supply.  “There weren’t any artists on the platform yet and I saw it as an incredible opportunity to get in early,” Riley Q told CoinDesk. “There’s not many untapped markets, but I managed to find one. I’m super excited for the future of crypto, Coil, and the music industry as a whole.”  Crypto Xpring  Xpring’s investment mandate is ambitious, to say the least.  Beard said he’s not been given any limit or minimum when it comes to investing XRP directly from Ripple’s own balance sheet.  “Our focus is on building a robust ecosystem around XRP,” Beard told CoinDesk. “We’re different from traditional investors in that we build infrastructure and tools that make it easier for developers to build with XRP, and then we support projects … around increasing the utilization of XRP.”  Now armed with a deep crypto treasury of its own, Coil itself is set to become a second focal point of XRP distribution.  CEO Thomas said Coil is running a “Booster” program that pays XRP grants to top content creators on its media platform. He declined to specify how many creators are involved with the program, although they collectively received $10,000 worth of crypto by May.  Beyond Imgur and Cinnamon, Coil is also partnering with a mobile browser startup called Puma Browser.  Puma Browser co-founder Yuriy Dybskiy told CoinDesk his Coil-powered mobile browser garnered 840 downloads on iOS and 300 on Android since it launched in July. Puma Browser partnered with Coil to enable XRP payments for applications such as the mobile game Flood Escape. Players who pay with XRP get extra perks, like enhanced character speeds.  “I think gaming is actually going to become a pretty big priority for us,” Dybskiy said, adding that openness to assets beyond XRP is what attracted him to work with Interledger, starting last year. “Interlegder has nothing to do with XRP in its design. It’s a great interoperability protocol.”  The two-person Puma Browser team is currently courting investors to raise a round of its own, including Xpring and other funds in the XRP ecosystem.

42403154,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf4hO,1565874005,Crypto Lenders Have Earned Just 2% on $4.7 Billion in Loans: Report,"A lot of loans have been made in crypto, but lenders have not reaped a lot of profit.  That's the big takeaway from a new report by Graychain, a startup looking to bring credit assessment to the crypto space.  The startup released its first report on the collateralized crypto lending industry Thursday, estimating that $4.7 billion has been lent out over the history of the sector, but only $86 million has been earned back in interest. That's a 1.8 percent return, despite the fact that loans typically cost borrowers 6 to 10 percent on an annual basis.  ""Generally these companies that are doing really huge originations are originating really short-term loans,"" Neil Zumwalde, Graychain's chief technical officer, told CoinDesk in a phone call.  In other words, it's easy to make the lending sector look stronger than it is by solely looking at originations. A loan can be quickly opened and closed and earn the lender very little because there is not enough time for any interest to accrue.  Graychain was able to accumulate part of its data from public chains where everything is in the open, including MakerDAO, Compound, dYdX and Nuo. But the report notes that 65 percent of the originations have been on Celsius and Genesis, which are private, and less prone to share full information about their businesses.  So Graychain offered the following note of caution in its report:  ""A good proxy for the industry’s health is the amount of interest collected. We have estimated this number. We calculated the rate at which many of these loans are liquidated or matured, and applied the average interest rate for each platform.""  Graychain was also able to get some private data from Dharma, Maker, Compound and Unchained Capital. There has also been information shared in marketing materials and public statements by those who did not participate, allowing Graychain to make a better estimate.  Graychain intends to continue to issue this report every quarter.  Sector growing fast  While the report suggests that the crypto lending industry has not been extremely lucrative thus far, in aggregate, it does show that there is a strong demand for the business.  ""The lending industry is maturing really, really quickly in this space,"" Zumwalde said. ""These markets are becoming more mature and people are trusting it more with their assets.""  A few examples of growth from the report:  In the first quarter, Graychain found 5,462 new loans; in the second quarter, there were 18,562 new loans.  Those loans in the first quarter amounted to $64.8 million; in the second quarter, that figure grew to $159.3 million.  The second-ranked public protocol, Compound, started the year with $13 million locked in the protocol and broke $100 million in early August.  That said, the bulk of borrowing has been made by private lenders, which generally offer the better percentage rates. While these companies dominate the sector, they seem to have a very high turnover.  For example, it's likely that many of these short-term loans from private lenders such as Celsius reflect speculative activity: traders borrow to avoid triggering a taxable event, then make a bet on a token, let it play out and pay off the loan as soon as the short-term bet has played out.  As the report notes:  ""From our quarterly analysis, you can see the number of loans originated grew faster than the new addresses and the total origination amount. That means that people are making more small loans, rather than borrowing millions at a time.""

Announced on Wednesday, the steem blockchain will undergo its 21st hard fork on Aug. 27 – one that will build in a new Worker Proposal System aimed to allow the blockchain to ""fund its own development.""  The new system – set up as a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO – will allow Steem users to publicly propose work they are willing to do in return for payment in the project's native cryptocurrency, steem dollars (SBD). The Steem.DAO will provide a way for the platform's users to vote on proposals, weighted by their stake in the platform.  Winning proposals will then be funded automatically via the blockchain. Steemit estimates the DAO will distribute from $1.5 million to $2 million per year.  Steemit said its DAO is similar to the failed Ethereum DAO – which was hacked for $60 million in 2016 due to a code bug – but stressed the Steem Proposal System ""has none of the security vulnerabilities of the original DAO thanks to Steem’s application-specificity.""  Michael Vandeberg, senior blockchain engineer at Steemit, said the concept was proposed and ultimately developed by steem community member Blocktrades.  “This is a big step forward in the development of Steem. We look forward to more partnerships between Steemit and our community. The Steem Proposal System will help make that a reality,"" Vandeberg said.  Launched in 2016  , the project says it has already distributed over $100 million in cryptocurrency rewards, and claims to be ""the most successful decentralized reward system in the world.""  Steemit has not been without its issues, however. Last November, the firm laid off almost 70 percent of its staff, citing the prolonged crypto bear market. Steemit CEO and founder Ned Scott said at the time: “There’s nothing that I want more now than to survive, to keep steemit.com operating, and keep the mission alive, to make great communities.""

As reported by SwissInfo.ch on Thursday, SDX CEO Martin Halblaub has announced he will be departing the exchange just eight months after taking on the role.  A disagreement over the future direction of the in-development exchange is said to be behind the move, with Halblaub having wanted to spin off the SDX into an independent company. The board however felt the upcoming platform should stay in the SIX Group fold.  In a memo circulated internally by SIX on Tuesday, Halblaub is quoted as saying:  “I fully support SDX’s ambition and business model and would have loved to lead SDX into the future. However, I have decided with a heavy heart – given our differing ideas on strategy, combined with the stretch the role is for my life model – that I cannot engage in a long term commitment as Head of SDX.""  Replacing Halblaub as interim CEO on Sept. 1 will be Tomas Kindler – currently head of business management and deputy to Thomas Zeeb, SIX's head of securities and exchanges.  Kindler may ultimately stay on as CEO, but the exchange said it has a launched a search for candidates for the role.  Halblaub has also been a senior advisor to SIX since 2016, and will ""continue to be available to support SDX,"" according to the memo which was penned by Zeeb.  In May, Zeeb indicated that the SIX’s planned digital exchange will go live with a native token and an “initial digital offering” (IDO) service in 2020.

Total weekly volume for the bears is lower than expected, offering a small hope for a bullish rebound.  Price would need a firm close above the 100-day MA in hopes of cementing a higher low relative to July 28's dip low.      Bitcoin (BTC) continues to tumble from temporary support levels at $10,000 after enduring its worst single-day loss in a month.  At 06:15 UTC, BTC's price pierced the 100-day moving average (MA) at $9,653, triggering a flurry of sell-orders as the mid-term trend switched from bullish-to-bearish.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has since recovered slightly and at time of writing is changing hands at $9,800 on Bitstamp, representing a 2.4 percent loss on the day.  Bearish market sentiment echoed throughout the world today as the international stock markets fell across the board with the S&P 500 down 2.9 percent, while the FTSE 100 in the UK dropped by 1.42 percent.  That would seem to dispell the notion that BTC acts as a safe haven asset, offering certainty during darker economic time.  Regardless, the onus is now heavily on the bulls to regain a foothold back above the 100-day MA on the daily chart or risk further downside.  Daily chart  As can be viewed above, the symmetrical triangle breakdown is well underway after BTC's price temporarily stalled along the 100-day MA at $9,652.  The bearish move is being supported by a histogram tick down on the awesome oscillator (AO) on the daily chart as it heads toward the neutral zero line, while the RSI fell bearish below 50 on August 13.  A failure by the bulls to close back above the key long-term moving average will undoubtedly spur further bearish pressure exposing lower weekly supports.  Weekly chart  A Fibonacci retracement drawn from 2018's peak low at $3,122 to 2019's peak high at $13,880 shows $8,501 to be the most likely landing zone in the coming week should its price close beneath the 100-day MA and July 22's prior bearish weekly close at $9,533.  Total weekly volume may offer some hope for the bulls as it's currently tracking worse than July 22's levels when the price of BTC rebounded from a low of $9,111 to a high of $11,085 as a result of weakening bearish momentum.  Falling price alongside limited volume usually points toward bear exhaustion, and may offer up a reversal and a new higher low above July 22's dip low.  That outlook will be determined by the end of the weekly closing period on August 18.  Disclosure: This author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

42403152,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdf4mJ,1565841616,Bitcoin's Surging Dominance – Is This Time Really Different?,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and CoinDesk’s Director of Research. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free weekly newsletter focused on crypto assets. Sign up here.      Everything flourishes with a bit of attention – even attention itself.  You may have heard some rumblings recently about the bitcoin dominance rate. This measures the weight of bitcoin in the crypto universe, by taking its market cap as a percentage of the total market cap for all crypto assets. Traders and investors keep an eye on it as an indicator of market preference.  It should surprise no-one that bitcoin is the dominant crypto asset, given its long track record and mainstream media attention. What is setting off alarms is its recent ascent: it is now hovering around 70 percent, a level not seen since April 2017, just before the previous bull market took off.    (Source: CoinMarketCap.com)    Some speculate that this means another bull run is imminent, one that will push bitcoin’s dominance to above 90 percent and effectively kill off any alternative crypto asset’s hopes of capturing significant market share.  Others see it as a sign that alternative crypto assets are on the verge of a recovery as investors pivot in search of outperformance.  As with any data point, there is much open to interpretation. Chart analysis aside, market metrics are rarely useful in isolation, and to get a feel for what the bitcoin dominance rate is telling us, we need a deeper understanding of what it represents – and why a rising number is not necessarily good news.  So what?  Why is the bitcoin dominance rate worth paying attention to? Surely everyone knows bitcoin is the leader?  Because it’s a relative measure that points to preference, conviction and momentum.  Price measures bitcoin’s popularity. Dominance measures its popularity relative to other crypto assets. In theory this could mean a “flight to quality” as investors get spooked by market risk and switch out of smaller cap tokens into a “safer” asset. Or, it could represent growing interest in the sector as a whole, along with conviction that bitcoin has the strongest fundamentals.  Either way, it highlights that, of all crypto assets, bitcoin is the most attractive from an investor’s viewpoint. (It’s important to note that dominance can increase as the price goes down, and decrease as the price goes up – it’s a relative, not absolute, measure.)  This matters for several reasons, one of which is what it says about market sentiment. While bitcoin is a speculative asset, it can be considered less speculative than smaller cap tokens, given its relative liquidity, history and network size. Its growing dominance points to a focus on fundamentals and on relative “safety,” which depicts a more grounded level of investor participation than in the ICO-fueled boom of 2017.  While not necessarily predictive, sentiment indicators tend to be recursive – you can’t be sure the trend will continue, let alone with what energy, but positive sentiment generally has in-built inertia. If traders choose to buy based on these indicators, they reinforce them, which encourages more traders to buy, and so on.  Another important consequence is market confidence, especially at the early stages of institutional involvement.  Large traditional funds are not, on the whole, particularly concerned with the relative merits of one token versus another. They are more likely to be evaluating whether to invest in crypto or some other speculative asset class as part of their portfolio diversification. For most, if they choose to invest in the sector, bitcoin is the only viable option: it’s the only one that 1) has sufficient liquidity to absorb a small- to medium-sized allocation; 2) has a lively derivatives market; 3) can count on a wide range of on-ramps and 4) is definitely not an unregistered security in most jurisdictions.  The protagonist role of bitcoin is likely to increase the confidence of traditional investors in the sector overall, burnishing its reputation and making their decision easier. In the absence of concrete valuations (difficult with bitcoin using traditional methods, since it has no cash flows), sentiment is usually as good a market indicator as any.  Now what?  No trend continues forever, though.  Previous run-ups in the dominance factor have been met with a correction as investor attention pivots and new alternatives come into play. In spite of momentum, in virtually all asset classes there comes a reckoning, in which market leaders become overvalued relative to the runners-up, and knowledgeable investors take profits in order to re-invest in more attractive opportunities.  But this is unlikely to happen in the short term, even though the last bull market saw bitcoin’s dominance drop from over 85 percent to below 40 percent. This time it is different.  Why? Last time the latter stage of the bull market was largely driven by the hyped potential of initial coin offerings, many of which promised revolution and riches based on marketing documents masquerading as white papers. The retail market poured into speculative tokens, which ramped up their value relative to the more “boring” bitcoin – at one stage, it looked like ether was going to push bitcoin off its market leader pedestal.  Recent market activity, however, has felt much more subdued (in spite of occasional shenanigans), largely due to increased regulatory scrutiny. The “sobering up” of the bear market, during which lawmakers and enforcers got to grips with the potential and threat of this new asset class, entrenched more rigorous standards for token issuers, promoters and investors. Many of the tokens issued in 2017 are now defunct, and while other interesting opportunities have emerged, the flow is more careful and calculated.  What’s more, the expected role of institutional investors in the next bull run, with their focus on bitcoin as the representative crypto asset, is likely to push bitcoin’s dominance up even further.  Then what?  What will it take for that to change?  All trends do eventually tire, to be replaced by new, more energetic ones. The same will happen with bitcoin. Once bitcoin investment by institutions is not such a novelty, and once deeper liquidity has dampened volatility, aggressive managers eager to beat their peers’ performance are going to start thinking about where to find alpha.  That’s when they start to look at other assets. They may rotate out of bitcoin into more overlooked alternatives; or they may put in fresh money. Either way, the relative weighting of other crypto assets will increase.  This is unlikely to happen any time soon, though.  Institutional involvement is just getting started and has a long way to run. Current currency turmoil and macro uncertainty may accelerate this, but a more likely scenario is that the bulk of institutional money, which tends to be relatively conservative, will wait for signs of further momentum before risking their reputations and returns.  The risk  Meanwhile, growing bitcoin dominance presents a risk we should not overlook: that bitcoin becomes firmly entrenched as the go-to crypto asset for the bulk of crypto investment, to the extent that it smothers interest in other ideas.  This would not be good for the sector, for two main reasons.  One, it would suck funding out of other areas of the market and stifle development of blockchain applications. Blockchain technology’s potential goes beyond bitcoin; it presents the opportunity to re-think how business models work, how assets can be valued and how income and capital can be distributed in a more decentralized economy. Other crypto assets are manifestations of this potential, and should be able to approach the market for funding and validation.  Two, concentration is a sign of an immature asset class. Imagine an emerging stock market in which one company accounts for 80 percent of the country’s market valuation. A diversified category will be more resilient, flexible and powerful, as internal connections and synergies empower a profitable irrigation of resources.  We are entering a phase where more attention will be paid to the dominance metric, which is likely to continue creeping up for some time. Some analysts are suggesting alternative calculations, taking out “fake volumes” and even stablecoins (since they are not seen as a competing investment vehicle) – a re-adjusted figure could be as high as 90 percent.  Could we get to a “tipping point” beyond which diverting attention from bitcoin will be extremely difficult?  It’s possible, but unlikely. People generally want to differentiate themselves from others; that also applies to their investment portfolios. Not only will investments in not-so-high-profile tokens better reflect retail investors’ personal preferences; but professional competition will also encourage crypto diversification in a search for outperformance.  Bitcoin’s dominance will probably continue to be unassailable for at least a few more cycles, though, and the inflow of funds, even if concentrated, will help the market infrastructure continue to mature. But, in the end, creativity and innovation always find a way to manifest.  Meanwhile, we should celebrate that bitcoin has not only survived but thrived. Its growing dominance and rising liquidity are signs that a greater number of investors believe in its potential. However, as exciting as that may be, it’s not the only thing going on.  As investors, we also need to keep an eye on what’s happening out of the limelight; from there will emerge the interesting opportunities of tomorrow.

On August 14, beginning at 12:00 UTC, BTC began to fall sharply from $10,862 to as low as $9,888 before traders bought the price back up above $10,000.  It marks the worst single-day loss since July 16, approximately 30 days ago.  However, BTC's price has successfully defended a sub $10,000 close on yesterday's trading period and is currently changing hands at $10,084.  The move down was also accompanied by a large surge in total trading volume, rising $13.5 billion over a 24-hour period as investors and traders rushed to close their positions in order to stem the bleeding.  Major names such as ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), XRP (XRP) and EOS (EOS) also began to fall in value at around the same time as BTC, losing between 8-12 percent respectively.  Further, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined endured a $20 billion loss over 24 hours with a total valuation of $265.8 billion by the time the dust had settled.  The short term outlook remains a volatile one, so BTC could experience a bounce on today’s momentum, but that will need to be accompanied by strong levels in growing (bullish) volume in order to end the recent sell-off still being felt from August 10.
