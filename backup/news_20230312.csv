Roughly 85% of SVB depositors held money in accounts that were not FDIC-insured, meaning that without federal action or an outright purchase of the bank those funds could be irretrievable.  Seeking to avoid a panic in the financial system, officials at the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. discussed safeguarding all uninsured deposits, the newspaper reported, citing three people who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Government action would be a possible fallback position should an ongoing auction for the bank fail to yield an acceptable buyer. Bids were due earlier this afternoon, the Post said, citing two people familiar with the auction.  Without a rescue or purchase, companies that banked at SVB may have difficulty meeting payroll, and checks or wires initiated right before the bank’s collapse may fail. (SVB was CoinDesk's bank.)  The price of bitcoin rose on the news of a possible rescue or purchase, jumping to as high as $21,582.26. In recent trading, the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market cap was at $21,400, up more than 4% in the last 24 hours.

Silvergate ( SI ), the bank that had ties to Sam Bankman-Fried’s failed crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ), has become the latest victim of the lingering market downturn, after revealing plans to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate. Before that decision, the 35-year-old San Diego, California-based company, which posted $1B of losses in Q4, said about two weeks ago it was forced to assess its ability to continue as a going concern, spurring an exodus among its institutional clients, including Coinbase Global ( COIN ) and Galaxy Digital ( OTCPK:BRPHF ). Silvergate ( SI ) then said it would discontinue the Silvergate Exchange Network, its crypto-payments platform, which was rolled out in 2018 to enable instant, 24/7 transfers between market participants and crypto exchanges and quickly grew to be one of its main growth drivers. What was once a $200 stock in late 2021 – the same year when bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) reached all-time highs – is now less than $3, as Silvergate ( SI ) saw its customers rushing to withdraw money out of the bank after November’s collapse of FTX ( FTT-USD ) and its sister trading firm Alameda Research, both of which reportedly had accounts at Silvergate. The Department of Justice last month was said to have started probing Silvergate’s relationship with Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire. Things could have been even worse if it did not hold $4.3B of short-term advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank at the end of 2022, in addition to the roughly $4.6B it had in cash. In starting the process of phasing out its bank operations, ""It's difficult to know what the ultimate outcome and timeline of this process will be,"" KBW analyst Michael Perito wrote in a note to clients last week. Prior to its demise, Silvergate ( SI ) was a key player in providing crypto-related banking services, but the financial contagion effects from the FTX ( FTX-USD ) downfall tarnished its once-mighty reputation. “The Silvergate case is special as the bank lost money not by making risky overleveraged loans against crypto collateral (like in the case of 3AC, Celsius, or FTX collapse), but by doing regular banking,” Shulga told ICS-digital in a recent interview, referring to the additional securities it sold at a loss so far in 2023 to fund the outsized run on deposits. In turn, “a downward spiral ensued with rapidly worsening capital adequacy ratios, which led to more clients withdrawing funds,” he added. “It’s definitely not good for the crypto industry, and this could potentially mean a certain trend towards crypto moving outside the U.S., at least until a more comprehensive regulatory framework is established in the U.S. Increased clarity on rules and regulations will actually increase the number and quality of banking relationships for crypto firms, as the industry stays here no matter what happens to Silvergate.” While Seeking Alpha contributor The Digital Trend expects ""drastic"" effects in the crypto space from Silvergate's ( SI ) fall, ""we know how resilient the crypto space and community are, there will be a rise from the ashes, and alternative payment 'rails' will be sought.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3946593-what-does-silvergates-shutdown-mean-for-the-crypto-industry?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10597674.jpeg

42412703,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5oyu,1678645964,USDC Volatility Lifts Bitcoin's Coinbase Premium to 3-Year High,"The crisis at Silicon Valley Bank and the resulting volatility in the world's second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD coin (USDC), has bitcoin (BTC) trading at relatively higher prices on crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN).  Data tracked by analytics firm CryptoQuant shows bitcoin's Coinbase Premium Index – which measures the spread between BTC's U.S. dollar-denominated price (BTC/USD) on U.S.-based Coinbase and BTC's tether-denominated price (BTC/USDT) on offshore giant Binance – rose to 0.8, the highest since March 2020.  Bitcoin trading at a premium on Coinbase is often taken to represent stronger buying pressure from U.S. institutions and sophisticated traders.  This time, however, the premium likely represents the discount or flight from USDC. Bitcoin's price on Coinbase became sensitive to USDC volatility since the exchange in July last year merged its order book – consisting of USDC as the base currency – with the USD order book. (Users can deposit USDC on Coinbase but it enters the order book as USD.)  Supporting the argument that bitcoin's current dollar-denominated price on Coinbase stems from the USDC discount is the fact that the BTC/USDT pair on Coinbase trades pretty much in line with prices on other offshore exchanges.  ""Because USDC is trading below its peg, BTC appears more expensive on Coinbase,"" pseudonymous decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher Ignas told CoinDesk. ""Therefore, the spot market for BTC needs to be adjusted to reflect the current USDC price.""  USDC fell as low as 90 cents late Friday, deviating from its 1:1 dollar peg after its issuer, Circle Internet Financial, confirmed holding $3.3 billion in cash at the crisis-stricken Silicon Valley Bank. The news triggered a rotation of money out of USDC and into other assets, with Circle processing more than $1 billion in net redemptions. At press time, USDC had bounced to around 95 cents.  At press time bitcoin had rebounded to $21,100 versus a low of roughly $19,600 touched on Friday.  ""When news broke that Circle's funds were stuck in Silicon Valley Bank, users rushed to redeem their USDC for USD,"" Ignas said. ""On Coinbase, users could redeem 1 USDC for $1.00, but Coinbase suspended conversions over the weekend when banks are closed, which worsened the situation, leaving traders with no option but to liquidate holdings in the spot market.""  ""There is no USDC market on Coinbase,"" Ignas added. ""So the BTC/USD market is effectively acting as a BTC/USDC market.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/12/usdc-volatility-lifts-bitcoins-coinbase-premium-to-3-year-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f64ee9ba4b3a106bd2e825d1fac341f7ad29d43f-1280x704.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""The reforms that have been put in place means that we're not going to do [a bailout] again,"" said Yellen in an interview with CBS News' ""Face the Nation.""  She did note that federal government officials were ""concerned"" for depositors and are ""focused on trying to meet their needs,"" however. Yellen also sought to calm fears that the bank’s collapse could lead to a domino effect. “The American banking system is really safe and well capitalized,” she said.  Roughly 85% of SVB depositors held money in accounts that were not FDIC-insured, meaning those funds could be irretrievable. The FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 for each ownership category at FDIC-insured institutions, of which SVB was a member.  SVB, a 40-year-old bank, collapsed earlier this week following a $42 billion bank run. The withdrawal rush occurred shortly after SVB Financial Group announced on Wednesday its intentions to sell $2.24 billion in new shares in an attempt to compensate for having sold $21 billion of its portfolio's securities at a $1.8 billion loss. The news spooked high-profile venture capitalists, which prompted them to order their portfolio businesses to pull their money out of the bank, kickstarting a bank run. On March 10, just two days after the bank run began, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) seized SVB.  SVB's failure marks the largest bank blow-up in the history of the United States since Washington Mutual's collapse in 2008.
