20374861,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561338,1700350218,"Dogecoin Metrics Signal Impending Breakout, How High Can The Price Go?","Dogecoin is definitely on a rally as shown by crypto market numbers. The cryptocurrency has experienced a significant market increase amidst a wider consolidation, with the price up by 7.46% in the past seven days. Although the price of DOGE was recently pushed back down today by some level of resistance near $0.087, it has since bounced back up again at $0.082. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.084, an increase of 2.4% from this support level. This indicates that the bulls are not ready to give up buying momentum. According to a recent post by crypto analyst Rekt Capital on social media, DOGE has finally confirmed a break out of a descending channel pattern. On-chain signals also point to a huge surge in interest and trading volume, indicating DOGE might be going higher soon. $DOGE has confirmed a breakout from its Channel#DOGE #Crypto #Dogecoin pic.twitter.com/SvmtG65FZa — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) November 17, 2023 Related Reading: Ethereum ETF Race: BlackRock Wants An Ether Spot ETF Metrics Signal Impending Breakout The current state of the cryptocurrency market appears to be one of general consolidation when viewed through the lens of the price action of the many different cryptocurrencies that are tracked by Coinmarketcap. Crypto market caps seem to be running out of steam after a four-week consecutive rally. However, Dogecoin’s market value has been increasing over the past week, bucking the trend of most other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market size, which has all shown a decline in their market caps over the past week. Source: IntoTheBlock Dogecoin has finally broken out of its narrow trading range in the weekly candle chart, surging over 45% in the past month. Several catalysts have contributed to this impending breakout, one of which is an increased trading activity. Another catalyst is the announcement of Astrobotic’s plan to send a physical Dogecoin token to the moon in December. Whale movements have also contributed for the most part. According to on-chain data from crypto analytics platform Santiment, the cumulative balance of wallets holding 10 million to 1 billion DOGE has increased from 44.63 billion DOGE tokens on November 1 to a cumulative balance of 47.38 billion DOGE tokens on November 17th. As a result, these large holders have increased their holdings by 2.75 billion DOGE, worth approximately $231 million at the crypto’s current price. Source: IntoTheBlock How High Can The Dogecoin Price Go? The technical indicators for Dogecoin are looking quite bullish right now. The short 10-day Moving Average has climbed steadily above the longer 21-day Moving Average since a bullish cross on October 23 last month, indicating the bulls still have major control over the market. A continued bullish momentum could see the crypto break various price resistances, the first being the $0.87 level.

The next hurdle is to break above $0.09 and then move towards $0.1. According to IntoTheBlock’s Global In/Out Of The Money metric, about 1.58 million addresses are still waiting for DOGE to climb above their minimum buying price of $0.858 before making a profit.

20367797,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561312,1700337609,Crypto Analyst Projects $7 Trillion Market Cap For Altcoins – Here’s When,"The altcoins market has been on a tear over the past few weeks, thanks to the resurgence of the premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and the shifting climate of the general crypto market. Although the recent momentum of the altcoin market seems to be waning, there is still broad optimism amongst many investors and analysts. Mags, a popular crypto analyst on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, has offered insight into the current landscape of the crypto assets class and its future prospects as the bull market seemingly approaches. Altcoins To Go Parabolic Again? In a post on X, Mags put forward a bold forecast for the altcoins market capitalization and expects the value of most cryptocurrencies to go parabolic in the coming years. The crypto analyst’s bullish argument revolves around the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicator on the monthly timeframe of the altcoin chart. On the highlighted chart, the monthly MACD is on the verge of making a bullish cross. Related Reading: Cardano Falling Wedge Pattern: Analyst Predicts 100% Increase Following Breakout From a historical standpoint, the crypto analyst cited that a similar bullish cross occurred on the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator in 2020. Following this cross, the altcoins market cap skyrocketed by more than 2,000% from $85 billion to $1.73 trillion. If this MACD cross forms again, Mags expects a similar bull run for the altcoins market. In what seemed like a more realistic stance, the crypto analyst postulated a surge to a $7 trillion market cap by 2025, even if the altcoins experience only half of the 2020 growth. This represents a roughly 1,000% rally from the current altcoin market cap of $637 billion. According to data provided by CoinGecko, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at $1.429 trillion, with Bitcoin maintaining its place as the largest cryptocurrency (market cap of more than 700 billion). Bitcoin Reclaims Dominance In Crypto Market According to a recent report by Santiment, Bitcoin seems to be back to dominating the altcoins after a good run in the past month. The on-chain analytics platform highlighted that most cryptocurrencies have been witnessing a price correction at the tail end of the week. 📊 #Bitcoin price dominance is finally back, at least for the time being. #Altcoins have been retracing on the tail end of the week after the past month’s blistering hot rally. If the crowd begins to get worried and show #FUD, however, we could see some quick price rebounds. pic.twitter.com/VAcKd27WIH — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 17, 2023 Related Reading: Bullish Sentiment Surrounds AVAX Price As Republic Adopts Avalanche Blockchain Many of the tokens in the altcoin class, including recent top performers like Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche, appear to be slowing down.

20359800,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561364,1700323514,Failed Bearish Signal Could Send Bitcoin To $85K Next Month,"Bitcoin recently gave a bearish signal, which ultimately failed to produce a meaningful pullback. Due to the technical failure, historical data suggests that in only a matter of a month BTCUSD could set a new all-time high and reach a target of $85K per coin. Here’s why. Why Failed Bearish Technicals Produce Bullish Breakouts In technical analysis, certain patterns are considered characteristically bearish or bullish. For example, the ascending triangle is a typically bullish-leaning pattern, but only breaks upward 63% of the time. The other 37%, the pattern breaks down bearish. Because of the nature of how orders and stop losses are stacked on either side of a pattern’s trend lines, a failed bullish pattern can be extremely bearish and vice-versa. Dissecting further, since the pattern was visibly bullish, it could have attracted more long-side positioning that is forced to unwind lower. Related Reading: Technical Analysis For Beginners: Learn How To Chart Crypto Recently, Bitcoin price gave a bearish TD9 sell setup on the weekly TD Sequential. However, no major correction followed. When this occurs, it often results in a sizable move in the opposite direction of the signal. More simply put, the failed TD9 sell setup could mean a massive move higher. And how high price could go and how fast might shock you. Could BTC reach $85K in four weeks? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Market Timing Tool Hints At Bitcoin Rally To $85K The TD Sequential is a market timing indicator developed by Thomas Demark. A TD9 setup or TD13 countdown is a specific sequence of candles that signal trend exhaustion. Back in 2020 when this same signal failed, Bitcoin blasted off to new all-time highs above $20,000 and then some. It rallied 143% in the four weeks following the signal and over 300% more in total when it was all said and done. Related Reading: Select This Chart Makes It Clear: Bitcoin Is Bullish This Chart Makes It Clear: Bitcoin Is Bullish If the same magnitude move followed this recently failed TD9 sell setup, Bitcoin price would reach $85,000 by the end of December. Another 300% beyond the current all-time high in BTCUSD would take the top cryptocurrency to over $200,000 per coin in total. In terms of lower prices, the indicator also provides TDST support and resistance levels. These levels rise and fall with each completed TD setup. This latest setup caused TDST floor price support to raise from $10,000 to $25,000, reducing the chances that BTCUSD ever trades below that price again. In December 2020, after a failed TD9 sell setup, #Bitcoin did another 143% in 4 weekly candles, pushing above former ATH resistance The same magnitude move would bring $BTC to another new ATH at $85,000 before the end of the year Still doubt my thesis we’ll see ATHs in 2023? pic.twitter.com/GwCXEaY1II — Tony “The Bull” (@tonythebullBTC) November 17, 2023 Tony is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

20350774,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561325,1700322055,Ethereum Whistleblower Reveals When Proof Of ETH Founders’ Fraud Will Be Released,"Amid the ongoing Ethereum scandal, former Ethereum advisor and attorney Steven Nerayoff has recently revealed how he plans on sharing proof of Ethereum founders’ fraud activities in the early days of the cryptocurrency asset. Ethereum Founders’ Fraudulent Acts To Be In Lawsuit Following an X (formerly Twitter) post by a user Heidi from Crytotips, the crypto enthusiast was seen trying to underscore the lack of authenticity from Nerayoff’s claims. According to her, his accusations were a no-brainer due to the disclosure lacking proof of his accusations. Related Reading: Options Frenzy: Bitcoin Rally To $37,000 Sparks Explosive Open Interest Surge However, Nerayoff in response to the video, asserted that he never claimed his accusations were going to be in the disclosure highlighting the crypto enthusiast’s lack of proper research. He further added that he is going to reveal the fraudulent acts of the founders in his lawsuit. Nerayoff had always noted that his recording was not actually linked to his accusations but rather his involvement with Vitalik Buterin. “The recording isn’t directly related to the fraud but will illuminate a lot of what was happening & show my involvement. The fraud will be in the lawsuit,” Nerayoff stated. Furthermore, the crypto expert also pointed out Nerayoff’s accusations towards federal agencies. According to her, the former advisor was a little paranoid with his accusations. During an X space, Nerayoff accused some high federal agencies of fabricating evidence against him in order to take him out. These include the SEC, FBI, and the DOJ. Total crypto market cap currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Nonetheless, in response to that, Nerayoff has asserted that this was actually proven and publicly filed. “The paranoia about the agencies? Well, that’s actually proven & publicly filed,” Nerayoff stated. Crypto Asset Is Not Decentralized From The Onset It appears Nerayoff’s claims about ETH not being decentralized from the early days are authentic. The post also saw the crypto enthusiast pointing out Nerayoff’s claims of ETH not being decentralized from the beginning. According to her, cryptocurrencies are not expected to be decentralized from the start and only the core team members know about a crypto asset from the start. If the expert is right then this basically means Will Hinman’s speech in 2017, about the asset being decentralized from the start was inaccurate. During the early days of the asset, Hinman asserted the decentralized nature of ETH, when it was considered as a security by the SEC. According to him, ETH was too decentralized to be considered a security. Related Reading: Crypto Acceptance Grows As Fidelity Joins Race For A Spot Ethereum ETF So far, both founders still have not responded to Nerayoff’s accusations. Nerayoff believes that their silence is due to the evidence he has against them. “Vitalik & Lubin are vicious if they have leverage. Lubin said to me in July 2018 about a network “It’s a centralized piece of sh*t” right after the Hinman speech! They stay silent because I’ll drop more receipts,” Nerayoff stated.

20354480,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561309,1700314211,This Prediction Reveals How Long It Will Take XRP Price To Cross $10,"XRP is one of the few cryptos with impressive price action this year. The cryptocurrency has been in the public eye for the past few months, as traders wait eagerly for XRP to embark on a major bull run ultimately. However, the crypto has been down for the past few days amidst ongoing market consolidation. Price action shows that XRP is down by 9% in a 7-day timeframe and is currently trading at $0.59. A recent price prediction made by the cryptocurrency exchange Changelly suggests that the value of XRP could skyrocket to the moon very soon. Its new price forecast says it could surge over 1,700 times its current value over this decade. This would cause the price of one unit of the token to increase from its current level of approximately $0.60 to more than $11 by 2030. Related Reading: Options Frenzy: Bitcoin Rally To $37,000 Sparks Explosive Open Interest Surge Changelly’s Very Bullish Prediction XRP’s growth has mostly been deterred since 2020 by the SEC’s lawsuit with Ripple, the technology company tied to the crypto asset. The situation changed recently in July 2023, and XRP is now in a position to step out of the shadow cast by this lawsuit. Although XRP’s price chart has rebounded at a resistance at the $0.70 level and looks like is going to end today with a red bearish candle, general sentiment still remains bullish in the long term. According to Changelly’s XRP price prediction, the crypto points to a 63 greed on the XRP Fear-Greed Index. As a result, the exchange puts the monthly closing price at $0.8032, a 33.87% increase from its current price. The optimistic outlook of the crypto exchange extends well beyond the scope of the current year’s forecast. Changelly predicted that XRP could break above its current all-time high of $3.84 by 2027. Total crypto market cap is currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Assuming the trend of price appreciation continues, XRP may surpass the $10 threshold by 2030, registering an average and maximum price of $9.71 and $11.37 respectively. This represents a staggering 1,790% increase from its current price. Additionally, the company also projects XRP reaching an average price of $19.91 in the two years after and a maximum price of $23.46 by 2032. How Feasible Is This Projection? As of right now, XRP is the only crypto with a clear regulatory status in the US. Changelly’s price prediction is obviously very bullish, but it resonates with the larger sentiment among crypto traders and analysts. In the short term, most analysts expect XRP price to remain volatile but trade within the $0.6 to $1 range for the remainder of 2023. Very bullish predictions have come for a larger timeframe. Analyst ERGAG CRYPTO has set various targets for XRP’s price, ranging from $5 to $27. From a technical perspective, XRP’s price just entered a Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) ranging zone, presenting an opportunity for buying more xRP.

20346117,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561286,1700299822,Worldcoin (WLD) Crashes By 11% As OpenAI Pushes Out Sam Altman,"Worldcoin (WLD) experienced a sharp decline in its market price on Saturday after its founder, Sam Altman, was removed as the CEO of popular artificial intelligence company OpenAI. This development follows the heavy regulatory scrutiny on the crypto project due to privacy concerns. Related Reading: Regulatory Pressure Mounts On Worldcoin, Can WLD Price Recover? OpenAI Votes Out Sam Altman, Cites Loss Of Confidence In a shocking development on Friday, OpenAI announced a leadership change, stating that Sam Altman will immediately exit the company as its CEO. In this statement, the company expressed its gratitude to Altman for contributing immensely to their development during his four-year tenure as their global leader. However, after an intense review process by the board of directors, it was concluded that the Worldcoin founder had not been fully honest in his exchanges with the board, leading to a loss of confidence in his ability to continue his duties as CEO. Following Altman’s departure, Mira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, will now act as interim CEO pending the appointment of a permanent successor. However, as one could expect, Altman’s removal as OpenAI CEO, combined with the scathing statements in the company’s announcement, has created a negative sentiment around the Worldcoin project. According to data from CoinMarketCap, WLD is currently down by 12.75% over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume has managed to remain afloat with a 15.13% gain. Related Reading: Binance Announces Listing Of Sam Altman’s Worldcoin, Opens Deposits What Next For Worldcoin? Worldcoin was officially launched in July with the goal of creating the largest digital identity and financial network. The project relies on the use of iris-scanning orbs to physically admit new members, prompting concerns about privacy, anonymity, and user data protection. After Altman’s departure from OpenAI, there are currently speculations on Worldcoin’s future trajectory. Clearly, Worldcoin benefited from Altman’s visibility as OpenAI’s CEO, as reflected in the token’s current downtrend. Notably, WLD gained by over 25% in October, with many analysts citing anticipation of the OpenAI developer conference in November as the driving force. Therefore, the removal of Altman from OpenAI may not bode well for Worldcoin in terms of credibility and public investor sentiments. On the other hand, Worldcoin could soon recover from its market slump and rise to higher heights despite this new challenge. Following its public official launch in July, Worldcoin came under much criticism from global regulators who expressed concerns over operations in regard to the collection of data using iris scanning orbs and the potential applications of user data. Notably, Worldcoin has been suspended from Kenya, while the governments of the United Kingdom and Germany have opened investigations into the project’s operation. However, the crypto project has remained resilient despite these regulatory hurdles, marking a milestone of 4 million app downloads and 1 million monthly active users, as reported earlier in November. At the time of writing, WLD trades at $1.85, with a 0.86% decline in the last hour. Meanwhile, the token’s market cap stands valued at $211.37 million.

The decision is a response to the recent action taken by BlackRock, an asset management company, which submitted their application for an Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) last week. Fidelity Is 7th On The List Fidelity Investments has recently positioned itself as the seventh asset management in the United States to pursue the aforementioned product. Based on the SEC’s Form 19b-4 filing, the Fidelity Ethereum ETF is called the “Fidelity Ethereum Fund” and is designed to track the performance of Ethereum. If approved, the ETF will trade in accordance with the BZX Rule, the company disclosed. Update: @Fidelity joins the spot #ethereum ETF race by filing a 19b-4 with @CBOE https://t.co/rxNEzpzh3g pic.twitter.com/o96XspPDEP — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 17, 2023 Related Reading: Options Frenzy: Bitcoin Rally To $37,000 Sparks Explosive Open Interest Surge Each share shall reflect a portion of the undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the Fidelity ETH Fund, the Registration Statement shows. ETH held by the New York Department of Financial Services on behalf of the Fidelity Ethereum Fund will make up the Trust’s assets. The Importance Of Spot ETFs Spot ETFs play a pivotal role in significantly expanding the reach of cryptocurrencies to the average investor, aligning with the increasingly emphasized goal of asset managers such as BlackRock, Grayscale, and other industry players. Despite the concerted efforts of regulatory bodies like the SEC to counteract this trend, the push for democratizing access to crypto investments has remained steadfast. ETH market cap currently at $232 billion on the weekly chart: TradingView.com At the forefront of the crypto market, Bitcoin and Ethereum stand as two of the most prominent digital assets, commanding substantial trade volumes and market values. Drawing a parallel with Bitcoin, Ethereum stands poised for a potentially significant surge in value within the next 24 hours, driven by the announcement of Fidelity’s application, marking a development that could significantly impact the cryptocurrency landscape. ETH Up 6.2% In The Weekly Chart At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $$1,930, up 2.3% in the last 24 hours, and sustaining a decent 6.2% increase in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Meanwhile, citing a section of the court ruling in the legal battle between Grayscale and the SEC, Fidelity Investments is optimistic that it will receive permission.

Related Reading: Litecoin Sustains 4-Month Run With 37% Gain, Beating Most Of Its Peers – Details As a result, the court ordered a review of the SEC’s ruling, and current information suggests that the SEC and Grayscale are still in talks over the suggested product.

In a recent discussion, Chris Kuiper, the Director of Research at the firm, examined the emerging prominence of digital assets and projected their potential for further expansion in the foreseeable future. The company’s hope that ETH would be used for large-scale transactions in the future is further expressed in Fidelity’s Spot Ethereum ETF application.

20328581,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561267,1700269222,Bullish Sentiment Surrounds AVAX Price As Republic Adopts Avalanche Blockchain,"Tech firm Republic has recently announced its mission to democratize private market investing, with the selection of Avalanche as the platform for launching its profit-sharing digital asset, the Republic Note (R/Note). The R/Note is a revenue-sharing digital security that is backed by Republic’s private equity portfolio, which includes over 750 assets. Republic And Avalanche Forge Partnership According to Republic’s announcement, Avalanche was chosen for several key reasons. Firstly, its scalability and speed ensure that Republic Note holders can enjoy seamless and cost-effective transactions. Notably, Avalanche has established partnerships with renowned brands like Amazon Web Services and Mastercard, highlighting its technical capabilities. Additionally, Republic plans to launch a dedicated Subnet on Avalanche next year, offering a purpose-built network specifically designed for the Republic Note. This will provide enhanced security, privacy, and regulatory compliance, creating a robust digital security environment. Related Reading: Is $40,000 Next? Unpacking 4 Reasons Behind Bitcoin’s Emerging Rally Mission alignment between Republic and Ava Labs, the team behind Avalanche, is another crucial factor. Per the announcement, both entities share a commitment to fostering a more inclusive future for financial markets through tokenization. Furthermore, Avalanche’s “eco-friendliness” sets it apart from other blockchains, consuming significantly less energy, per the announcement. The pre-sale of Republic Notes has already attracted participation from thousands of individual retail investors, resulting in pre-sales exceeding $30 million. The public listing of the Republic Note is scheduled for December. Optimism For AVAX Price The partnership between Republic and Ava Labs is anticipated to have a positive impact on the AVAX price. The launch of the Republic Note on Avalanche’s platform establishes a strong foundation for expanding its reach to a global audience of investors. Despite a 5% decline in the past 24 hours, AVAX has outperformed major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), with a 130% rally over the past 30 days, positioning itself as one of the industry’s top performers. However, it is important to note that AVAX has recently undergone a correction, and its ability to surpass the $20.64 level will be crucial in determining its prospects amidst the ongoing bullish momentum. Resistance levels at $21.59 and $22.74 have proven challenging for AVAX to breach and consolidate since February 2023. Related Reading: Cardano Breakout Of Epic Proportions: Analyst Predicts 1600% Rally To $6.5 Overall, the forthcoming launch of the Republic Note on Avalanche’s mainnet is a significant milestone in making the asset accessible to pre-sale participants who have contributed over $30 million.

The collaboration between Republic and Ava Labs underscores their shared vision of democratizing access to private markets through tokenization.

While the digital asset community is often rife with bullish predictions, Morgan’s realistic outlook presents a grounded perspective on the potential of XRP’s value. The Parabolic Price Move: A Myth Or Reality? Since the significant ruling in the SEC v. Ripple case on July 23, which brought legal clarity to XRP, the asset has seen an uptick in its trajectory. Related Reading: Altcoin Delight: Solana Balloons To 50%, Nearly Triples In A Month – Here’s Why The ruling led to multiple exchanges relisting XRP and forming strategic partnerships.

Three great outcomes in the court case since 23 July 2023, legal clarity, multiple exchange relistings, more Ripple partnerships and increasing ODL use and myriad other positive news have moved the price from $0.46 to $0.62 in that time. Better than some coins not as good as… https://t.co/NMwiWqfdWt — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) November 17, 2023 Morgan’s analysis delves deeper into the relationship between XRP’s market behavior and Bitcoin (BTC). Contrary to the popular belief that XRP might soon undergo a parabolic price increase, Morgan noted: We keep being shown charts supporting claims that a parabolic breakout is imminent but price still seems to just go up and down with Bitcoin and generally loses ground on the XRP/BTC pair. This observation particularly challenges the narrative of a forthcoming surge in XRP’s value, often depicted in the community’s discourse. The idea of XRP achieving a three-figure value seems even more improbable to Morgan. He questions the likelihood of such a significant increase in XRP’s price in the short, medium, or long term. While the crypto market is known for its unpredictability and rapid changes, Morgan’s post suggests expecting a meteoric rise in XRP’s price might be overly optimistic. His stance encourages a more measured and realistic approach to understanding XRP’s future market performance. XRP Latest Price Action Meanwhile, XRP’s market performance has seen significant fluctuations recently. After an initial surge alongside the broader bullish crypto market trend, the asset has faced a downturn, with a 10% decrease over the past week. In the last 24 hours alone, XRP’s price has dipped by 4%, currently trading around $0.60, down from its weekly high of $0.69.
