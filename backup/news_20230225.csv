India is this year's G-20 president.  The announcement came after three days of meetings among the 20 largest economies of the world in which creating a global regulatory framework for crypto was a priority.  The discussions held between the G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors were expected to chart the way forward for globally coordinated crypto rules.  The synthesis paper will be submitted during India's G-20 presidency, which culminates in September when India hosts G-20 leaders from around the world, said Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during a press conference.  Asked whether consensus around global crypto regulation that India had prioritized for its G-20 presidency will take placeduring India's term, Sitharaman said that ""first of all, we are going through the study process so that there can be informed discussions.""  ""Something should develop,"" Sitharaman added, referring to the FSB's expected paper in July that will lead to the synthesis paper by September.  Sitharaman added that Canada's central bank governor cautioned other members that crypto assets should not be given ""regulatory seal of approval"" without a well-thought-out approach and a framework for implementation.  ""The World Bank stated that views of all developing countries should also be included in any (crypto) policy framework,"" Sitharaman added.  India Central Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said that there was a marked shift in perception around crypto assets by G-20 nations in the past year, in which several major crypto companies, including the FTX exchange, collapsed.

Those tech troubles combined to effectively freeze nearly all on-chain activity on the Solana network. By 2 a.m., the network was processing about 93 transactions per second (TPS), well below the rate near 5000 TPS some 15 minutes prior, according to the data site Solana Explorer.  It was a crisis reminiscent of the chain’s rocky tech incidents in 2022, when a series of halts and slowdowns prompted reforms to how Solana manages inbound traffic. Saturday’s incident had no immediate culprit, though validator operators and network engineers suspected a bug in the new version of Solana code that had come online hours before.  Without a definite bug to squash, some validators began downgrading to the previous version in hopes of reviving Solana’s throughput, said the pseudonymous SolBlaze, who runs a liquid staking pool and is active in developer circles. Later, Solana employees began advocating for the downgrade, too.  Within hours a supermajority of validators had switched back to the old software in their attempt to restore Solana’s operations. But it did little to solve the still unknown problem that was weighing down performance. The effort then turned to a more drastic solution: restarting the chain to the point immediately prior to the forking.  “Coordinating a restart attempt means that the chain will be offline completely, which is always the last resort,” SolBlaze said.

The data cemented fears that the Federal Reserve will have to tighten policy for longer than expected. Markets are pricing in ~75% chance that rates will top 5.25% by the end of the Fed's June meeting.

The SEC is said to be investigating whether stablecoins are issued in violation of investor protection laws. The NYDFS bolstered its ability to identify illegal activity among crypto entities with new risk monitoring tools . U.S. financial regulators warned banks of liquidity risks associated with certain sources of funding from crypto-related entities. Countries' Moves on Crypto Hong Kong will make crypto trading on licensed exchanges legal for all its residents, starting June 1. The Bank of Israel laid out a number of proposed rules for stablecoin activity, in a move motivated by the demise of terraUSD ( UST-USD ).
