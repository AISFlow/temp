20822518,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562915,1701212421,"Bitcoin Storms Past $38,000 Once More, Anticipating Breakout To New Annual Peak","Bitcoin (BTC) has again demonstrated its bullish momentum by surging above the $38,000 mark. Breaking free from the recent trading range between $36,500 and $37,500, BTC currently trades at $38,100, slightly below its yearly high of $38,400 achieved on Friday, November 24. However, this is just one of the many milestones BTC has achieved during its ongoing bullish resurgence. Bitcoin Achieves New 52-Week Closing Record According to crypto trading firm The Birb Nest, Bitcoin has set a new 52-week closing record by a small margin, holding above $32,000 for four consecutive weeks, demonstrating the continued strength of the uptrend. Per the firm’s analysis, the observed performance aligns with the principles of Elliott Wave Theory and signifies the presence of the third wave within the ongoing bull market. Related Reading: Unlocking Bitcoin ETF Profits: Experts Reveals “Best” Trading Strategy Notably, of the five waves outlined in the theory, the third impulse wave is a visually captivating and crucial element of the overall pattern. Following the consolidation phase of the second wave that Bitcoin experienced between August and October, as seen on the 1-day chart of BTC above, the emergence of the third wave is characterized by a breakout that drives price action in line with the prevailing trend. In particular, this wave is known for its extended nature, which often exceeds the length of the first wave, which began at the beginning of January 2023 for BTC. The third wave exhibits a substantial extension relative to the length of the initial wave, typically reaching the 161.8% Fibonacci level. In simpler terms, the third wave can be interpreted as a 161.8% Fibonacci extension of the first wave. Solid Support Levels Reinforce Positive Outlook For BTC According to The Birb Nest, key technical indicators further support Bitcoin’s market momentum. The 200-week moving average (MA) at $29,130 and the 50-week MA at $27,450 serve as solid support levels, reinforcing the positive outlook for the cryptocurrency. Additionally, Bitcoin’s correlation coefficient has risen to 0.75, indicating an increased synchronization with the performance of the S&P 500. This correlation can be viewed as a positive sign, particularly as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq enter their ‘Best Months’ strategy, which historically has been associated with market gains. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 4400% XRP Price Surge To $27, Here’s When Furthermore, the firm believes that anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving event and the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) is fueling investor interest. These factors hint at the potential for further market upturns and provide an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin’s future. It remains to be seen if the current bullish momentum will be sustained and if BTC can consolidate above $38,000 and target the $40,000 level yet to be reached in 2023.

When all was said and done, the token’s price had risen over 70000% from its all-time low of $0.0001699 which was recorded on June 1, 2022, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Given that the KAS token has risen so much, all eyes are now on the next coin that could replicate this growth. With thousands of altcoins in the space to pick from, with many of them being scams, it can be daunting to know which coins have the potential for such a rally. So in this report, we take a look at two altcoins that could potentially go the way of KAS and secure massive gains for investors. Geeq (GEEQ) Leads Low Cap Altcoins With Utility Geeq (GEEQ) was one of the many altcoins that burst into the scene back in 2020 as the bull market took flight. In the same year, the token would hit a new all-time high. But perhaps the most alluring part of the project was the many utilities that followed suit.

When a mainnet arrives, it will make it a prominent player among established blockchains. GEEQ’s market cap is currently sitting at less than $5 million which gives it a lot of runway to pull a run like KAS. It is also listed on multiple centralized and decentralized exchanges, including KuCoin, AscendEX, and Uniswap, among others. Total crypto market cap at | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com OXBT Piggybacks Off The Ordinals Craze As Ordinals became more of a fixture in the crypto market, multiple projects emerged that enjoyed the majority of the popularity. Some of these include the ORDI project that eventually scored a Binance listing and its price soared above $20 sending its market cap to $400 million. However, others such as OXBT (Ordinals) were right behind ORDI and have enjoyed a good level of success as well. OXBT’s price rose as high as $70 before falling more than 99%. But still remains one of the largest Ordinals tokens in the market. Related Reading: Shibarium Transactions Spike 288%, But Why Is Shiba Inu Price Down Today? For OXBT, which is currently sitting at just a $4.1 million market cap, the bull narrative lies in the fact that Ordinals could make a comeback. This is not the first time that a narrative could be seen as over but yet come back stronger. Even the Ordinals have already proven this is possible. In such a case, then OXBT would be right behind ORDI and a run up to a $400 million market cap would mean a 100x, and could go higher as the bull market rolls around, performing similarly to Kaspa (KAS). “Disclaimer: The following op-ed represents the views of the author, and may not necessarily reflect the views of Bitcoinist.

42409342,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGbCX,1701211334,Aave's GHO Stablecoin Nears Elusive Dollar Peg,"Sometimes it takes a dictator to get things done in decentralized finance. At least, that seems to be the case for Aave's stablecoin GHO.  The asset, which has been valued at less than $1.00 for nearly all of its life, gained ground this week and rallied to $0.985 for the first time since August. Its volatile gains aren't doing anything to fix GHO's reputation as a not-so-stablecoin, but they do set the token close to the levels one might expect from an asset that's supposed to be worth a dollar – not $0.96.  The higher price price matches the target set by the hands-on DeFi engineer who insiders have called GHO's ""benevolent temporary dictator,"" TokenBrice. This month the pseudonymous Frenchman took over the liquidity committee Aave tasked with restoring GHO's dollar peg. He then embarked on an ""ambitious gamble"" to at least get GHO halfway there by Nov. 30.  Getting GHO on peg is no easy task because the stablecoin doesn't work like others do. It lacks a redemption mechanism that usually ensures these assets maintain a lower bound. And the interest rate is controlled by Aave governance, another possible negative in borrowers' eyes.  TokenBrice's strategy focused on incentivizing buying support for GHO in a very targeted manner. This played out most critically on the DeFi protocol Maverick, an Automated Market Maker that offers more levers than other AMMs for controlling the liquidity of its pools.  ""We are using, for the first f------ time ever in the history of Defi, liquidity shaping in an opinionated manner,"" TokenBrice said in an interview with CoinDesk. (He's also an advisor to Maverick).  ""We don't just pay for liquidity and incentives somewhere, we pay for a very specific kind of liquidity that are biased toward the buying side, and it helps us create price support for buying pressure for GHO, and progressively push it upward.""  In a Nov. 23 committee report, TokenBrice said Maverick's so-called Boosted Pools had decisive advantages for engineering liquidity compared to better-known DeFi trading stalwarts, like Uniswap.  ""Far from being a panacea, the new AMM stands out as a solution to help stablecoins return to peg,"" TokenBrice wrote of Maverick in the report.  The Maverick solution has certainly worked for GHO, said Marc Zeller, a vocal member of the Aave community who leads the Aave Chan Initiative. He said there may be some conflicts of interests in TokenBrice implementing and singing the praises of a project he advised.  The GHO repeg ""is a great ad for Maverick,"" Zeller said in an interview. ""But let's say that from my & Aave DAO's point of view, that's a win win."" He compared the situation to a ""double edged sword: a failure would not have been great for Maverick.""  Zeller said his ACI also had a hand in organizing the repeg. ""We coordinated governance, increases to borrow rate & DAO deals.""  There's more to come in GHO's road to $1, he said. For starters some Balancer pools have an excess of GHO token, and that needs to be addressed. And the token's total issuance has been capped at 35 million for months, limiting its ability to grow.  ""Once we reach a critical mass of sane liquidity around peg, we will propose to the DAO a ""Stop and GHO"" approach to gradually increase the mint Cap of GHO allowing more assets in circulation and a virtuous circle of liquidity,"" Zeller said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BAL | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MINING | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/28/aaves-gho-stablecoin-nears-elusive-dollar-peg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e44f312b13591849ab39ff5743d71fab5eb1dada-802x492.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC's price has been rising, and the regulatory crackdown on fraudulent players in the industry is expected to pave the way for the legitimization of BTC as an asset class. MSTR's average purchase price of BTC is $29,586, making it an excellent proxy for BTC, and its stock price has been outperforming the percentage move in BTC. My interest in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) proxies continues with an overview of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). MSTR, unlike the past reviews on the BTC miners, embarks on a differentiated strategy to become a quasi-spot ETF with a slow-growth software enterprise. Under the tutelage of its founder, Michael Saylor, they have leveraged the balance sheet to acquire a copious amount of BTC over the past few years. My review of the equity’s prospects will focus on the MacroStrategy holding company, where the bulk of the BTC is held, along with a general overview of the path of BTC and upcoming debt maturities. Upcoming catalysts for Bitcoin By levering up its balance sheet, MSTR is intrinsically linked to the price of BTC as it makes up much of the equity. For MSTR to move higher, BTC must be advancing. Data by YCharts The price of BTC has caught fire since October as the regulatory win by Greyscale over the SEC has opened the door for the possibility of multiple Spot ETFs to enter the marketplace. BTC was trading in the mid $20k range only to push above $30k in short order and is now in the range of $35-37k. The change in sentiment is refreshing, thus heightening the dormant bull's expectations that higher prices are in the near future. From a technical perspective, the area around $40k offers round number resistance with an interesting historical caveat. The $40k number serves as a major line of resistance, marking the area BTC was trading at before the true effects of the catastrophic Terra Luna blow-up that eventually took out Three Arrows Capital and Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange. SBF was found guilty of fraud and is expected to face a hefty prison term, thus helping to clean up some of the greatest sources of fraud that plague the industry. Not to be outdone, Changpeng Zhao (affectionately known as CZ), t he head of the offshore exchange Binance, plead ed guilty to money laundering charges and paid a $50 million dollar fine. Binance itself paid a whopping fine of $4.3 billion and pleaded guilty as well. Why do I find these events so particularly important? In my opinion, it underscores the massive clean-up of the less-than-reputable players ahead of the legitimization of Bitcoin as an asset class via a spot ETF vehicle. The next domino to fall may be Alex Mashinsky of Celsius, who has already been arrested and charged with fraud . Not to be overshadowed by regulatory events, the BTC network will undergo a halving where the block reward for successfully ""mining"" a block will be reduced from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. In the past three cycles, the halving event has created a positive feedback loop where the reduction of new supply has caused a surge in the price of BTC. BTC has neatly followed the classic boom-bust commodity cycle and, in my opinion, should be viewed through the lens of a commodity, not a currency alternative. MacroStrategy Saylor has created a unique corporate structure where the cash flow of the legacy software business is used to pay the interest on the copious debt used to purchase the BTC, which is held predominantly by the MacroStrategy holding company. As of Oct 31, 2023, MSTR owns 158,400 BTC, with 142,514 held by MacroStrategy and the rest by MSTR. Part of the reason for this move is the current accounting rules on how BTC is treated on a corporation's balance sheet. MSTR has spent $4.7 billion acquiring its horde of BTC, yet it is being carried on the books at a value of $2.5 billion. The $2.2 billion in cumulative impairment charges has caused MSTR to take the massive non-cash loss on earnings that, in my view, causes the majority of CFOs to pause on adding BTC to the corporation's balance sheet. The FASB is expected to issue new rules on the treatment of digital assets that may pave the way for wider corporate adoption. MSTR's average purchase price of BTC is $29,586, offering investors a unique way to ride the price of BTC higher. The equity price of MSTR has caught fire recently with a move from the $330 range up past $500 per share in the past six weeks. The move in MSTR share price over the past 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month periods outstrips the percentage move in BTC. Data by YCharts Risk Factors A thorough review of the debt maturities held by MSTR is required to give investors a comprehensive overview of the unique risks of an investment in MSTR. The legacy software company held in the MicroStrategy shell is not growing with negative revenue growth the past decade. In my view, part of the reason MSTR embarked on its BTC crusade was to diversify its holdings, as the business generates a ton of cash, and bonds or cash seemed a worthy investment to beat inflation over time. Saylor is using the cash flow from MSTR legacy software to fund the interest payments on some of its outstanding debt. The move seems prescient at $38k BTC and foolish at $20k BTC. The second risk is the convertible debt held on the books. The debt issuance is a masterstroke in my view, with an interest rate of 0.75% on one tranche and zero on the second tranche. The first tranche is for $650 million and comes due in December 2025, well after the halving cycle and well into the expected run-up due to a shortage of new BTC. There are no guarantees that BTC will run up in a manner similar to past historical patterns or that MSTR will be able to refinance the debt at an attractive rate. MSTR may be forced to issue additional equity, which would dilute existing shareholders. The conversion rate for the notes is initially 2.5126 shares of MSTR stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, with an initial conversion price of approximately $397.99 per share. The only positive is that MSTR can redeem for cash, shares, or a combination of both at their discretion. A similar cycle may play out with the second tranche due February 2027 with an effective interest rate of zero. The bonds are convertible into 0.6981 shares of MSTR at a conversion price of $1432.36 per share. A conversion seems less likely currently, yet a big BTC price run may change those dynamics. A conversion into shares based on current US interest rates seems more likely as cheap financing is unavailable until the Fed cuts rates. In my view, I am bullish on the current prospects of MSTR well into the end of 2024 based on past BTC pricing dynamics. To add some context, a move up to old Bitcoin highs (using $70k as a target), the BTC holdings of MSTR would be worth roughly $11 billion, far greater than MSTR's current market cap in the $7 billion dollar range. Currently, MSTR BTC holdings are worth less than $4 billion, with, in my view, a fair value on the enterprise business of 6 times revenue or $3 billion. MSTR stock is overvalued from a sum of the parts model if you are using a static model for BTC. My bullishness stems from the equity now serving as a quasi-spot ETF (due to the BTC held on the balance sheet) with BTC entering into a historically bullish period of time. I am more inclined to fade the equity into 2025 unless additional clarity is gained on the path of how the two convertible bonds will play out. Call me a bull for now.

XRP & BNB Have Seen Largest Drops In 60-Day Correlation To Bitcoin As pointed out by an analyst in a post on X, BTC has recently seen a drop in correlation with the altcoins. The “correlation” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of how tied the prices of any two assets are right now. When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the given assets respond to moves in each other’s price by moving in the same direction. The closer the indicator’s value is to 100%, the stronger this correlation is. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Is Only Just Starting, According To This Metric On the other hand, negative values imply that there is a negative correlation between the assets, as their prices are moving opposite to each other. In this case, the extreme is -100%, so the more negative the value, the more tight the relationship is. The 0% mark represents the point where no correlation exists between the prices, implying that movements in one have no bearing on how the other might perform. Now, here is a chart that shows what the 60-day correlation between Bitcoin’s daily log returns and various altcoins looks like right now, as well as how it compared a year back: Looks like XRP has seen the strongest decoupling out of these coins | Source: @CryptoBusy on X As displayed in the above graph, the 60-day correlation between Bitcoin and XRP appears to have significantly decreased in this period, as it has plunged from nearly 80% to almost 40%. This means that XRP’s price has been moving much more independently of BTC during the past 60 days. BNB (BNB), Avalanche (AVAX), and Solana (SOL) have also seen some decoupling from the original cryptocurrency. Still, these alts have seen the indicator decline by much less than XRP has observed. Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are the altcoins that have observed the least amount of change. However, in the case of the memecoin the correlation was lesser than the other assets to begin with, so even with the small decoupling, its correlation level is still matching that of BNB. Generally, correlation is something to watch for whenever an investor is trying to diversify their portfolio, as two assets with significant correlation wouldn’t provide much safety.

We do believe in the promise of technology to lead us to a new era of human progress and prosperity. We also believe technology can deliver unimaginable destruction and harm, accelerated by the power of AI.  We believe the internet was created over half a century ago to connect machines to machines and data to data, not people to people. Its outdated design has reduced people to users. It has become a techno-capital engine, incentivized to stalk, manipulate, and prey upon people – and it has dehumanized us.  Frank McCourt is the founder of Project Liberty and author, with Michael J. Casey, of the forthcoming book OUR BIGGEST FIGHT: Reclaiming Liberty, Humanity, and Dignity in Our Digital Age to be published by Crown in 2024.  We believe it has become an insatiable machine that harvests our identities to generate enormous wealth for tech and social media Goliaths. We cannot unsee the price the world is now paying for their profits.  The harm is real  We believe the breakdown of civility and democracy, our cultural and political polarization, the radicalization of our neighbors, the censorship of free speech, the increase in mass shootings, our inability to agree on what is good and true, the displacement of parents from their rightful role in protecting their children, and AI’s threat to millions of livelihoods are all in large part consequences of our digital dehumanization.  We believe our children’s mental health is under attack by a system that so powerfully exploits their vulnerabilities and self-doubts that their brains are being altered. Children are harming themselves and committing suicide at record rates.  We believe our society and democracy cannot survive such autocratic, centralized technology.  We are more than big-tech’s data  We believe people have been stripped of their rights on the internet because it doesn’t see us as human beings at all. It sees us only as data, which Big Tech manipulates and monetizes. Until we are recognized as people, not just producers of data, we will not reclaim our voices or our rights.  We believe a small group of techno-capital innovators have been incentivized to rule as kings, exploit us, and rationalize our exploitation as progress.  The Techno-Optimists will say everything is fine. They mean, “Don’t touch the money we are making from your data.”  We believe millions of Davids can regain their voices, overcome these Big Tech Goliaths, and bring a better web to life.  Urgency  We believe owning your own data is the first, indispensable step in creating a better internet and a healthier world.  We believe you should own you. We believe you, not Big Tech, should own your data.  We believe the modest reforms tech giants have touted are deceptive band-aids that allow them to continue to profit from exploiting children and society at large.  We believe our need to act is urgent. AI is a powerful accelerant. And, in recent days, this technology has been leveraged to fuel Big Tech’s further growth.  If we do not put people at the center of the internet, AI will pour gasoline on the digital fire that is already searing our children, communities, and workplaces. The bright promise of generative AI will not be worth the human cost.  The future  We believe it doesn’t have to be this way. We don’t have to settle for today’s dehumanized digital world.  We believe people have inalienable rights. We do not surrender these rights merely because we are active on the internet. We must take back what is ours: We should own our identities, whether in the physical or digital world.  We believe a better web is not only possible; it is happening now.  A uniting purpose  We believe a healthier and more human internet is not a cause belonging to any political party or ideology. It is the uniting purpose of everyone who imagines we can do better.  We believe “moving fast and breaking things” must have a limit: Tech elites should not profit from destroying democracy and breaking human lives.  We believe a better web will empower people, not soulless digital machines.  We believe we can revive innovation, competition, and capitalism by building a better digital ecosystem, not by expanding the broken one. We believe you should have a voice in governing the platforms that use your data. We believe you should have a stake in the profits your data generates.  We believe the ability to own and control your data, the essence of who you are, is the digital age expression of liberty. We believe we should be free digital citizens, not Big Tech’s digital serfs.  We can build a better world where technology is celebrated for uniting us rather than rewarded for breaking us.  A new and better web is being built now. Join us.

42409333,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGaim,1701202421,Everyone Needs a Manifesto,"Yesterday, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin published a long, long blogpost delineating a new philosophy of techno-optimism. It is called d/acc, with the d standing for decentralization, defensive and/or differential and the “/acc” a trendy shorthand on social media for “acceleration.”  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Accelerationism, once a bugbear of the techlashers, is an academic concept (originally looking into how science, reason and technology drive progress throughout history) that escaped from the lab and now essentially means “I’m pro-tech”.  Buterin, always thoughtful, has found a middleway between techno optimism and pessimism, and argues that technology broadly speaking is good but some technologies are better than others and some technologies can be net negative.  As The Defiant’s Cami Russo already wonderfully summarized:  “Buterin's 'd/acc' philosophy advocates for a deliberate and balanced path in technological development, focusing on technologies that ensure defense, decentralization, and human flourishing.  “The concept emerges as a counterbalance to the unbridled techno-optimism espoused by figures like Marc Andreessen and challenges the e/acc (effective accelerationist) movement.”  Indeed, Buterin comes right out and says he is responding to Andreessen, the founder of highly influential VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and builder of world’s first browser, Netscape, who published his “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” to much aplomb and interest last month.  Andreessen says many things about technology and markets, for which he is both in favor. Parts of his manifesto could be read aloud at a slam poetry open mic. It is extremely aphoristic, and only slightly repetitive (i.e. could not the section on “abundance,” also good, be inferred by previous statements about how more “energy” is better, through which humanity builds and enjoys things?).  But I’m not a billionaire, so who am I to judge? The important thing is that Andreessen-aligned techno-optimists believe that “technology is a lever on the world – the way to make more with less.” This means technologies like AI, nuclear and markets should be unfettered. Competition leads to progress, because it increases choice and is something of an evolutionary process.  Much of this Buterin seemingly believes, too. Though Buterin is smart enough not to mention controversial arch-accelerationist Nick Land, and potentially have his ideas dismissed immediately by association.  These dismissive people probably also believe in things like “deceleration” and “de-growth,” or slowing down technology and making the economy pocket-sized; these are some of Andreessen’s “enemies.”  See also: Why Bitcoin Needs Philosophy | Opinion  Though Andreessen has many enemies, including Malthus, the guy who incorrectly predicted that overpopulation would crush Britain, because he did not have the foresight to imagine the Industrial Revolution or advancements like chemical nitrates in agriculture, Andreesen does not consider that technology can sometimes be an enemy to humanity.  To my knowledge, Andreessen does not once mention that technologies sometimes pose risks. Not the small or the big, like microplastics or global warming. Which is unfortunate, because he spends much time thinking about the children, who are the future, but cannot be the future if they have thalidomide poisoning.Thankfully, this is where Buterin comes in.  Buterin, as mentioned, is keenly aware that digital technologies can be used to exert control, erode privacy and further authoritarianism. He considers how industrial factory farming is likely to cause a future pandemic, given that animal diseases often pass to humans like measles did. He spends a lot of time considering the hot topic of the day, the risks of non-aligned, or rogue, AI.  And this is for the better, because Buterin also spends a lot of time in the further reaches of reality, considering things like brain-computer interfaces, and self-administered open source vaccines and/or nebulizers and … DAOs. Everyone needs to be nebulized sometimes, but technology giveth and taketh, and we’d do well to consider the bad with the good.  Both Andreessen and Buterin know that technology has often led to human flourishing because signs that technology has led to human flourishing are everywhere, and that is good because humanity is good, and so technology should be pursued. The difference is that Buterin acknowledges this progress is not a straight line that moves like an arrow through time.  Buterin also calls for more collaboration and, as Russo puts it, “intentional steering” of tech, whereas Andreesen seems to imply that “great men make history” and that technology is a force that gushes out from the unknowable depths of human ingenuity. Both ideas have their virtues, and it sort of depends on your point of view (and testosterone level) whether you privilege social cohesion or total transformation.  Likewise, both philosophies owe a debt to professional brain Steven Pinker, who fell on a thousand swords a few years ago for deigning to say that the world has gotten better over time, largely due to technology and reason, in “Enlightenment Now.” Which is to say, there is likely still room for MORE manifestos.  See also: Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Opinion  If two manifestos can be published that essentially say the same thing, both repeating a decade-old book that ripped its best ideas from Hegel, who lived in the 1800s, then surely more can be said about capital-P Progress. Just make a few slight alterations; perhaps you give it a globalized perspective or discuss memetics. I will await the treasures of your mind manifesto.  Although Buterin does a good job explaining how “d/acc” can fit well under many political systems, including libertarianism, effective altruism and the punks both solar and lunar, it is still a system with a point of view. In other words, like any theory, Buterin’s is incomplete and can be argued with.  For instance, Andreesen and Buterin both inherently think that this is not the best possible world — because technology can always improve upon the current moment. That is a statement! But what, young Voltaire, if you do think this is the best possible world?  Can the best possible world be improved by technology? Is humanity actually regressing? Am I indirectly trying to inspire the next Ted Kaczynski?

He noted that something may be brewing for the token and its ecosystem. Interestingly, he agrees that XRP could rise as high as $9.6. XRP Price Could Replicate 2017 Impulse In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, CryptoInsightUK shared a monthly XRP/BTC chart. He noted that XRP’s largest impulse against BTC was around 5,200%, which occurred back in 2017. Analyzing the chart that he shared, he suggested that a similar setup to that time was building up. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Pour $346 Million Into Crypto – Here Are The Winners This time, XRP could see higher gains against BTC as CryptoInsightUK stated that the XRP is holding a higher floor. He also mentioned that the technical structure is more bullish after a longer consolidation. Besides these indicators, he highlighted the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is grinding upwards. With all this in mind, the crypto analyst believes that “something is coming” for the XRP token. CryptoInsightUK seemed very careful not to provide any projections on how much the XRP token could rally or what price action to expect when this happens. However, another prominent crypto analyst, Egrag Crypto, provided an insight into what price action CryptoInsightUk may have in mind. In response to the main post, Egrag replied and stated that XRP could hit between $9.6 and $10 this time around. CryptoInsightUK responded and stated that Egrag’s prediction is “perfect for the range.” Token price resumes uptrend toward $0.61 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com XRP’s Success Hinged On Bitcoin’s? CryptoInsightUK shared some further thoughts when quizzed by another X user if the community may see any XRP price action this year. He suggested that any XRP rally was dependent on Bitcoin’s move as XRP goes higher whenever Bitcoin does so. As such, he is cheering Bitcoin on right now so that there can also be some price action from XRP. Related Reading: Ripple IPO May Be Delayed, Crypto Pundit Gives Reasons Why As to when to expect this rally from XRP, he isn’t certain, as he stated that finding the starting point is hard. That is why the analyst is just comfortable with holding and waiting with his XRP bags. Despite the uncertainty, the crypto analyst seems to be one of those who is very bullish on the XRP token. Another prominent figure in the XRP community, Rob Art, also shared similar sentiments with CryptoInisghtUK. He suggested that XRP cannot make a new all-time high (ATH) without Bitcoin doing so in the same cycle. As such, he believes that XRP can only fly when Bitcoin does so, too. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.60, down almost 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42409338,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGaw0,1701199709,Coinbase CEO Says Binance Settlement Will Turn the Page on Crypto's 'Bad Actors',"Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong says the industry can finally close the chapter of bad actors after the recent settlement between Binance and the U.S. Department of Justice.  “There certainly have been a few bad actors in crypto and I think we’ve had a moment recently with the enforcement action against Binance that’s allowing us to turn the page on that and close that chapter of crypto’s history,” Armstrong said in an interview with CNBC International Monday at the Global Investment Summit in London.  He also said that the criminal enforcement actions against Binance and the once-popular but now bankrupt crypto exchange FTX show that taking your business offshore doesn’t work. While Binance is a Hong Kong-based company, mostly focused on business in the Asia Pacific region, FTX was headquartered in the Bahamas.  “Sometimes it’s easy to get big fast by skirting the rules but you’ll always come crashing back down to reality,” he said, arguing that it’s time for U.S.-based companies that have complied with regulation from the beginning to grow.  Though different from Binance’s legal struggles in the U.S., Coinbase is still battling with U.S. regulators on allegations that the exchange operated an unregistered broker, exchange and clearing agency simultaneously. Armstrong said he feels good about the case's outcome and that it will help with regulatory clarity in the U.S.  The company remains focused on its commitment to its U.S. business despite its efforts to grow in other jurisdictions, including the U.K., which Armstrong said is Coinbase’s second biggest market. “We started the company in the U.S. and we’re committed to staying there and we’re going to grow there because it’s a big market.”  Armstrong also said the race to launch a spot-bitcoin ETF is “monumental” for the industry. “It’ll bring in new sources of capital into crypto that aren’t able to participate directly today and I think it’d be a legitimizing outcome for the industry,” he said.

20816248,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562903,1701198008,Analyst Thinks DOT Will Reclaim Former Glory With Polkadot 2.0,"DOT, the native currency of Polkadot, a smart contract platform, remains under pressure, posting sharp losses after soaring to an all-time high of around $55 in 2021. The coin is trading at about $6, volatile but up roughly 45% from 2022 lows, buoyed by the broader recovery across the crypto scene. Will DOT Break Above Immediate Resistance Levels? Despite DOT’s woes, one crypto trader, @Ashcryptoreal, is bullish on the coin’s prospects, pointing to the eventual implementation of Polkadot 2.0, a critical update for the cross-chain network. Taking to X on November 27, the crypto trader believes that Polkadot 2.0 will fix present issues plaguing the smart contract platform. Specifically, Polkadot 2.0 represents an overhaul set to introduce several enhancements that could, if executed as stated, propel DOT above current resistance levels. With rising DOT demand, the coin, and by extension, the platform, could soar, rising to its former glory as one of the leading blockchains with dense user activity. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Skyrockets Close To 500,000% in 24 Hours Looking at price action, DOT is moving within a broad horizontal range with caps at around $3.5 and $7.5. Despite the recent spike, which saw the coin roar by 45%, prices are moving inside the bull bar of early November. Based on this, there must be a sharp expansion from spot levels above $5.6 with rising trading volumes for buyers to be in charge. Even so, the current formation still favors buyers. What’s The Big Deal About Polkadot 2.0 Polkadot 2.0 overhauls certain features as it is currently in the network. However, most importantly, analysts observe that proposed changes could enhance the network’s capabilities and attract more developers. After the update, Polkadot will migrate from the dynamic block space allocation system, allowing developers to purchase block space as needed, either in bulk or individually. This flexibility could make the network more appealing to various projects. Additionally, Polkadot 2.0 will introduce elastic cores, enabling the network to adapt to varying computing demands depending on use. This adaptability may make the network more efficient. Moreover, it adapts to the diverse needs of developers. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 4400% XRP Price Surge To $27, Here’s When The concept of coretime, which measures computing resource demands, will be a notable addition to Polkadot 2.0. Like in EOS, resources in “core time” will be purchased through auctions or pay-as-you-go basis, allowing developers more control. Analysts expect these changes to increase the demand for DOT since the coin serves as a medium of exchange. All on-chain transactions are settled in DOT.

42409340,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGazJ,1701197191,Fiery Public Hearing on Digital Euro Sees Experts Diverge on Key Issues,"European Union lawmakers questioned four expert witnesses on the implications of a potential digital euro as they consider legislative proposals.  Lawmakers have opposed European Central Bank plans for a digital euro.  Experts answered questions on holding limits, closeness to cash and privacy concerns of a central bank digital currency but seemingly diverged on key issues.  A digital euro is complicated, as evidenced by a two-hour public hearing hosted by members of the European Parliament on Tuesday.  The EU’s plans for a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) from earlier this year faced opposition from lawmakers who questioned the need to have one in a jurisdiction where payments are pretty efficient, whether citizens’ privacy will be preserved, and – more controversially – whether it could be used to expand state control.  The hearing was meant to help lawmakers understand the subject better as they consider legislative proposals. But the invited experts diverged on practically every issue – from whether cash is on the decline to individual holding limits for a digital euro.  “The arguments on balance today would not favor such [a decision to issue a CBDC] in my view,” said Italian economist Ignazio Angeloni, who wrote a paper for the Parliament this year titled “Digital Euro: When in doubt, abstain (but be prepared).”  “An invasive form of public intervention like this one would be justified only if clear evidence were to emerge of malfunctioning in the present system. But this is not in sight at the moment,” he added.  Angeloni was immediately countered by former Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Fernández Ordóñez, who not only praised a potential digital euro as a safer asset than bank deposits but went on to say a CBDC could help deregulate the banking sector because a lack of deposits would negate the need for deposit insurance and prudential measures.  Read more: Digital Euro Can End Bank Crises, Is Better Than Deposits, Ex-Bank of Spain Chief Says  Holding limits  Vicky Van Eyck, executive director of Positive Money Europe, assured lawmakers the destruction of banks was not the goal.  She advocated for gradually removing the proposed 3,000 euro CBDC holding limit in legislative plans to curb the mass abandoning of deposits.  ""We don't think that we can jump from bank deposits to suddenly central bank digital currency with no limits. We have no interest in seeing the banking system crash,” said Van Eyck. “But we do think that a temporary holding limit that is gradually lifted through stress tests and research is the correct way to go.”  The movement of funds from commercial banks to the central bank would put the banks in danger and put the financial system in peril, Angeloni said, adding that a digital euro bringing more safety to financial systems is “an illusion.”  He added that a CBDC would have a “contractionary effect” on bank deposits, but how much will depend on the holding limit.  Bigger banks would suffer more from mass exodus because they’ll have to bear more outflows, said Marieke Van Berkel, head of retail banking, payments and digitalization at the European Association of Cooperative Banks (EACB).  “The more customers you have, the bigger the problem becomes, which is also the case of cooperative banks,” Van Berkel said.  Van Eyck noted that although the EU proposed a 3,000 euro limit on individual CBDC holdings, banks initially pushed for a 60 euro ($66) limit.  Privacy, crypto and the death of cash  One of the biggest questions the ECB has faced is whether a digital euro would replace cash. The central bank has tried all sorts of campaigns to dispel those concerns, including with a Kahoots! Quiz.  Naturally, much of Tuesday’s hearing was spent discussing whether cash is doomed – something Ordóñez affirmed but Angeloni called a “myth.”  “What we're seeing is this gradual decline of the physical euro and people shifting to risky, private digital currency, and that's one more reason why … it's useful to have a public currency,” Ordóñez said.  Angeloni said countries like Norway and Sweden – where cash use is low – are exceptions to the rule.  “It's true that U.S. networks like MasterCard and Visa have high market shares in Europe, but their dominance is far from established in Germany and in Italy, for example,” he said.  But a digital euro similar to cash – particularly one used for offline payments – could enhance users’ privacy, according to Van Eyck.  “The offline version of the digital euro is crucial as it is most able to mimic the anonymous nature of cash today. The design and choice of technology for the offline version need to be carefully chosen…” she said.  As for crypto, they’re no threat to traditional payments, according to Angeloni.  “Crypto and stablecoins are very different assets. They're not used and they will not be used in the foreseeable future for payments. That's impossible. They are too volatile. They are too costly...

20814816,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562863,1701194448,Unlocking Bitcoin ETF Profits: Experts Reveals “Best” Trading Strategy,"The potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is bound to open new opportunities for traders. The expectations surrounding this event impact the market now, but an expert believes they will have a more substantial effect in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: $48,000 By Early January, Forecasts Proven Indicator As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $37,400 with a 1% profit in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency stayed in the green with a 3% profit, holding the critical level of $37,000 despite the increase in selling pressure. The Lucrative Strategy In Anticipation Of Bitcoin ETF Approval As Bitcoin’s value soars with a remarkable 125% increase this year, a new trading strategy emerges, promising high returns in the wake of the anticipated Bitcoin ETF. A seasoned market analyst, Markus Thielen, unveils insights into leveraging the evolving crypto market dynamics for profitable trading in an essay posted by options platform Deribit. Thielen’s analysis reveals an “unusual” trend in the Bitcoin market: despite its significant rally, the 30-day realized volatility remains at a modest 41%, starkly contrasting to the 5-year average of 63%. According to the analyst, this subdued volatility reflects a declining interest in leveraged Bitcoin options, a direct consequence of institutional players entering the crypto arena. These players, holding significant Bitcoin assets, will likely sell volatility, fostering a more stable market environment that mirrors traditional financial markets. In this landscape, the strategy of selling strangles (120% call and 80% put) on a 30-day rolling basis stands out. According to Thielen, this approach has shown profitability in approximately 23% of cases over the past year, as seen in the chart below, marking a significant improvement from the decentralized finance (DeFi) summer’s high-risk profile. At that time, DeFi protocols attracted billions in capital to the crypto ecosystem contributing to the incipient Bitcoin rally. While there are differences in the current market dynamics, options players are likely to benefit from this strategy. This strategy, particularly effective during low-risk periods, suggests a window of opportunity for traders to capitalize on before introducing institutional influence. Institutional Involvement Expected to Stabilize Bitcoin Market The anticipated launch of the Bitcoin ETF is set to transform the market further. This event is expected to recalibrate the put/call ratio, which leans heavily toward calls. Thielen compares it to the S&P 500, where the put/call ratio has been more balanced. The Bitcoin market might soon witness a similar equilibrium, presenting an opportunity for traders to harness volatility through a sell-put strategy. Furthermore, Thielen notes that the post-ETF approval phase could be the last chance for traders to exploit high volatility levels. Once institutional players begin systematically selling volatility, the market is expected to enter a phase of reduced price fluctuations, making volatility-based strategies less effective. The analysis also touches upon Bitcoin’s correlation with broader market indicators like the VIX index. While the Bitcoin market has maintained high volatility relative to the VIX index, this gap is anticipated to narrow, offering traders a strategic edge in timing their trades effectively.

42409341,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcGb5v,1701194387,COP28 and Bitcoin: The Beginning of a Beautiful Friendship?,"This week sees the kick-off of COP28, the annual conference to discuss a coordinated global approach to dealing with climate change issues. This year, it is held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), one of the world’s largest oil producers.  Already desperate rhetoric is emphasizing the catastrophic cost of inaction; 120 heads of state are brushing up their speeches; and even Pope Francis will make an appearance despite a lung inflammation.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Yet, as usual, the event will most likely end up being a waste of time as well as energy (of all kinds). Nevertheless, there is a positive crypto twist embedded in the shambles.  COP chaos  First, let’s briefly address my skepticism.  The track record so far is not auspicious. The first COP (which, if you’re curious, stands for Conference of Parties) in 1995 called for governments to establish specific, legally-binding targets and timetables for reducing developed country emissions of greenhouse gasses. Almost 30 years later, we still don’t have those.  The chair of the event is Sultan Ahmed Al-Jaber. He is also CEO of the state oil company ADNOC, which is expected to boost its oil production next year after the recent upward revision of the UAE OPEC+ quota. ADNOC has also been aggressively expanding its international fossil fuel interests. I do believe that an oil executive is better placed to get other oil executives to listen, and ADNOC is working on diversifying its revenue streams. But it’s a stretch to ask us to believe there is no conflict of interest here. Indeed, leaked documents have revealed that the UAE was planning to use its position as host country to discuss oil and gas deals with more than a dozen countries.  Governments around the world are aware that more funding is needed to combat climate change. In 2009, donor countries agreed to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries reduce their dependence on fossil fuels. This target was only reached this year, but it doesn’t matter anyway: a recent report by the International Energy Agency suggested that the annual amount needed would be more like $2.7 trillion. Not all of that would need to come from public coffers, which is just as well since most developed economy governments are struggling with more short-term priorities such as helping allies defend borders, maintaining benefits and not defaulting on sovereign debt.  Plus, emission reduction policies are not popular with voters and could lead to political upsets. The surprise win in last week’s Netherlands general election of far-right candidate Geert Wilders was in part a result of some of the drastic emission measures proposed by the outgoing government, such as reducing livestock herds. In Germany, dwindling support for the once-powerful Green Party has made space for a resurgence of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AFD). Many European countries are at odds with the EU’s plans to charge shippers for their emissions – and the EU goes to the polls next year.  Elsewhere, leaders are walking back climate commitments due to internal pressure. In September, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that the U.K. was delaying its decarbonization plans, to avoid “losing the consent of the British people.” Germany is reactivating several mothballed coal plants this winter to avoid an energy shortage. China has approved roughly 50% more coal plants over the past two years than in the two years before that.  There are so many issues that impede an alignment of global incentives to fund the transition while curbing fossil fuel production and use that all the above is just scratching the surface.  Yet we are encouraged to curb our cynicism because COPs are important for raising awareness of the importance of “doing something.” I’m all for doing “something,” but after 28 years of these conferences, we have made little progress in understanding the economics of the problem, and in addressing the necessary incentives.  Perhaps Al-Jaber can bang some heads together and get some representatives to override national interests. But he would have to do that for all delegates, and with the UAE not exactly setting a good example, the chances are slim.  Meanwhile, the cost of hosting such an expansive event (which is increasingly being dominated by commercial interests) must be astronomical. Over 70,000 people are expected to attend. I doubt they will get to Dubai by rowboat or bicycle.  Why it matters for crypto  A valid question is when the vast expense of all the COP-related hand-wringing will be diverted to focus on technological breakthroughs that will help with adaptation as well as more efficient renewable generation systems.  One such breakthrough is Bitcoin. It is by no means a solution to all of the hardship ahead from climate change, nor will it solve many of the barriers to greater adoption of renewable energy. But it can help with decarbonization.  It wasn’t that long ago that Bitcoin was vilified for its environmental damage. Investors and casual observers rejected the very idea of learning more about bitcoin because it was harmful. Climate activists campaigned for the code to be changed, lawmakers campaigned for its mining to be banned. Thankfully, this has largely died down as study after study debunked the false claims. Remember how in 2017 Newsweek proclaimed that Bitcoin mining would use all of the world’s electricity by 2020? We’ve come a long way since then.  It’s not just peer-reviewed papers that have highlighted the potential for bitcoin mining to support greater investment in renewable generation and methane capture. It’s also a powerful sprinkling of well-written reports from institutional research teams such as Bloomberg and KPMG. The narrative has shifted. Even misguided regulators have pivoted their crypto objections to focus on illicit uses.  The way-too-brief summary is that Bitcoin mining can economically support the construction and operation of renewable grids, even small ones in remote areas, by acting as a swing consumer. Bitcoin mining is practically the only industrial energy user that is location agnostic (rigs don’t care where they are as long as they have energy and an internet connection) and can power up and down with relative ease.  What’s more, bitcoin miners can help mitigate methane emissions from fossil fuel production by converting the gas into energy to power the income-generating machines. According to the International Energy Agency, methane is responsible for roughly 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, and fossil fuel production is the third largest source of methane contamination (after wetlands and agriculture). Removing part of this while helping to secure a financial network sounds like a win for energy companies, bitcoin miners, investors and – of course – the environment.  There is so much more to say on this, but in sum, bitcoin is a significant piece in the climate change adaptation puzzle.  And this year, COP28 will have its first Bitcoin mining delegation. I don’t know to what extent Bitcoin miners were present in previous COPs, but the fact that this time there is an official “delegation” with a high-quality panel feels significant. It almost cements the shift in the narrative, and will hopefully help to spread the constructive possibilities even wider.  It also highlights just how “early” Bitcoin is. Its technology is misunderstood by most, its use cases are undervalued by many, and its potential is as yet barely appreciated.  The environmental misunderstandings have been painfully frustrating – but, with Bitcoin actually having a presence at the most high-profile climate change conference, we can appreciate that progress has been made. There’s a long way to go yet, but events like this will help push the narrative forward, and connect various interests that will together work on the small steps that can take us all a long distance.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MINING | RESEARCH,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/28/cop28-and-bitcoin-the-beginning-of-a-beautiful-friendship,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/26898f105a7be20e4a26225fe07eeee14fae76f7-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The comments were in response to an investigation into unlicensed virtual-asset trading platform Hounax, which reportedly defrauded people of millions of dollars. By Monday, 145 people said they had been victims of the fraud for a total of HK$148 million ($19 million), the South China Morning Post reported.  Government supervision is needed to protect investors and crack down on unlicensed platforms, Lee said according to the report. The Hounax case follows a similar one involving crypto exchange JPEX, which led to the arrest of six people in September after more than a thousand complaints involving a total of $128 million were filed. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said JPEX was also operating without a license, prompting Lee to call for stronger licensing laws at the time.  Following the Hounax incident the SFC published a list of licensed virtual-asset trading platforms to aid investors when they are deciding which crypto platforms to use. The SFC said it does not have the power to close unlicensed crypto exchanges, the SCMP reported.  Hounax was put on the alert list by the SFC on Nov. 1, and authorities should have gone a step further and blocked the platform from contacting the public to prevent further harm, lawmaker Doreen Kong told a local outlet on Monday.

The next catalyst, wrote the bank's Geoff Kendrick and team, will be the approvals of several U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs, which they expect “are likely to come sooner than expected.""  “We think a number of spot ETFs will now be approved in Q1-2024 for both BTC and ETH, paving the way for institutional investment,” they said.  The team also reminded that the next Bitcoin ‘halving’ – a mechanism to limit supply and currently expected to take place in late April 2024 – will be another source of price upside.  Standard Chartered initially made its $100,000 prediction in April, arguing then that the cryptocurrency had benefited from its status as a branded safe haven.  “Put simply, everything is working as expected,"" said the bank in its reiteration today. ""BTC’s dominance remains intact – its share of overall digital assets market cap has increased to 50% from 45% in April.""  There is also a chance that the cryptocurrency will climb to the $100,000 mark before the end of the year, the bank said. “We now expect more price upside to materialize before the halving than we previously did, specifically via the earlier-than-expected introduction of U.S. spot ETFs.

This time, he is predicting that the token could rise to as high as $27. He also laid out why this is a real possibility. How XRP Could Climb To $27 In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Egrag highlighted $1.3, $3, $5.8, and $27 as the “next stops” for XRP. He mentioned that $27 feels like a “plausible target,” having the 2017 surge in mind when the token saw a 61,000% gain in 280 days. According to Egrag, on the way to $27, $3 and $5.8 “stand as critical milestones.” Once that is done, the road isn’t going to be all clear for the token on the way to $27, though. The analyst believes that XRP pushing to between $6 and $7 might come with “some turbulence.” He further shared a chart to illustrate how the current price action and a “yellow fractal pattern” indicate a striking similarity.

If that happens, the crypto analyst stated that the next level will be the pivotal goal of $1.3, which happens to be a crucial resistance level. Egrag seemed very optimistic about the future of XRP. He mentioned that the ecosystem is set to enjoy a surge of liquidity in the next bull run. He also alluded to the fact that XRP happens to be the safest investment choice as a result of the regulatory clarity it enjoys. Price recovers after brief dip | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Regulatory Clarity Is The Biggest Selling Point Regulatory clarity continues to be a constant as many analysts tip XRP as one of the tokens that are going to see immense gains in the next bull run. Recently, prominent crypto analyst CryptoInsightUk shared his thoughts on whether XRP could enjoy a similar success to the one back in 2017. One of the factors that he mentioned is the fact that XRP is in “a unique position” following Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling that the token isn’t a security in itself. Ex-banker and financial expert Kyren also alluded to this fact when he mentioned that the next bull run “will be a special one for XRP.” Related Reading: Renowned Finance Author Says Buy Bitcoin Now Before It’s Too Late, Here’s Why Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty had previously mentioned that XRP has a unique positioning in the US since it has been declared as a non-security. This regulatory clarity is believed to have helped revive interest in the token. Many exchanges have also gone to relist the token, and many seem to be showing more interest in XRP.

Inflation data, he said is also moving in the right direction.

42391968,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfyBJh,1701188100,"Central Banks Have No Interest in Personal Data, BIS Official Says While Promoting CBDCs","Retail central bank digital currencies (CBDC) have drawn criticism from lawmakers and the public around the world over privacy concerns.  Unlike the private sector, central banks have no interest in personal data, Bank for International Settlements official Cecilia Skingsley said Tuesday.  She urged people to stay open to technological innovation.  Central banks have no interest in personal data, said Bank for International Settlements (BIS) official Cecilia Skingsley on Tuesday, seemingly looking to quell privacy concerns surrounding national digital currencies.  The central bank group has been pushing governments around the world to continue work on central bank digital currencies (CBDC) to prepare for the future of payments.  However, monetary authorities in major jurisdictions like the U.S. and the European Union are facing mounting criticism over plans to issue CBDCs, and a chief concern is if and how citizens’ privacy will be protected.  The public too would feel better about using digital versions of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or British pound if privacy was preserved. Ensuring privacy increased participants' willingness to use a CBDC by up to 60% when purchasing privacy-sensitive products, a recent BIS report showed.  Skingsley, is the head of the BIS’ Innovation Hub which is responsible for multiple CBDC research projects with central banks around the world. Skingsley addressed privacy fears while speaking at the Atlantic Council's CBDC conference in Washington DC, and urged the public to stay open to technological innovation.  ""Central banks have no commercial interest in personal data – unlike the private sector,"" she said.  Information that banks have on where, how and what people spend money on is protected by legal frameworks – something which Skingsley urged should be preserved when countries decide to issue retail CBDCs.  When considering the design of a CBDC, people will also have to grapple with difficult questions on choice, inclusion and stability, Skingsley said. But ""innovation usually takes us to new places and opens up possibilities that were not there until a new technological breakthrough has happened,"" she added.  Some people are concerned that retail CBDCs could cause bank runs – where too many people withdraw their money at the same time putting pressure on banks’ liquidity. With the right provisions like fast-acting crisis management tools and limits on fund withdrawals, CBDCs won't necessarily increase the possibility of bank runs, Skingsley said.  Wholesale CBDCs, which are another type of currency used only between banks, could be a ""game changer"" for cross border payments, she added, pointing to BIS Innovation Hub projects like Jura, Dunbar and mBridge as examples.  ""Based on our findings, benefits from issuing a wholesale CBDC could include operational transparency, faster settlement, [and] less risk,"" Skingsley said.  The BIS will on Wednesday publish the conclusions from project Tourbillon, which proposes new privacy solutions for retail CBDCs.

Binance.US announced in a tweet Tuesday that while it is not a part of last week's massive multibillion-dollar settlement between Binance and various U.S. regulators and law enforcement entities, Zhao will transfer his voting rights to a proxy.  ""That said, as CZ transitions to life after Binance, he has decided to step down from his role as Chairman of our Board of Directors and transferred his voting rights through a proxy arrangement, whereby his interest in the company is purely economic and he will no longer be involved in our governance,"" the tweet said.  Binance was accused of operating in the U.S. without registering with any appropriate entities, ultimately allowing U.S. crypto investors to transact with Binance customers from sanctioned regions. The company agreed to pay $4.3 billion, make a ""complete exit"" from the U.S. as part of its settlement, and accept Zhao's resignation as CEO.  A senior Treasury official told reporters that Binance.US was not part of Binance's settlement as it was a registered business.  While Binance.US is not part of last week's settlement, it's still facing a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement action over offering what the regulator deemed are unregistered securities to U.S. investors. That case, which also includes Binance and Zhao, is ongoing.  ""Binance.US continues to be led by Norman Reed and our existing, experienced management team.

Shiba Inu Burn Rate Increases Significant The Shiba Inu burn rate recently increased significantly by 499,416% in a 24-hour period between Sunday and Monday. Data from Shibburn – the platform that tracks SHIB token burns, shows this marks a new record for the token’s burn initiative. It also highlights the renewed strength of the community’s attempts to manage its token total supply. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Project Calls Out Founders For Refusing To Burn 103 Trillion SHIB Furthermore, the data also shows that over 264.20 million SHIB tokens were burned on the same day. The recent uptick in the SHIB burn rate can be traced back to several burn transactions. However, a single transaction that was carried out by an unknown wallet address is believed to have buttressed the surge. According to the data available, the unknown wallet address transferred approximately 261.4 million SHIB tokens to a burn wallet on Monday. An important turning point in the SHIB burn initiative was reached with this transaction alone. This is because the transaction made up about 98% of all the tokens burned during this time. Another transaction also garnered significant attention in the community. The wallet transferred approximately 21.52 million SHIB tokens to a burning wallet. These kind of transactions are significant because it reduces the total supply of SHIB tokens in circulation. Over 410.66 trillion SHIB tokens have been burned from its total supply in circulation. Currently, the total supply of SHIB tokens in circulation is sitting at approximately 589.35 trillion tokens, according to CoinMarketCap. The Importance Of SHIB Revealed A Shiba Inu community member has recently revealed the importance of the SHIB tokens in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The member suggests that people need to read the Shibpaper to know the role of the token. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Marketing Lead Reveals The Important Role Of SHIB In The Shibarium Ecosystem They took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a screenshot of the project’s whitepaper on the role of the SHIB token. According to the screenshot, the tokens serve as the ecosystem’s legislative instrument as it states that SHIB tokens “propels legislative machinery.” It also grants every Shibizen an equitable voice in molding the project’s journey. The screenshot read: The Shib token allows for symbolically propels our legislative machinery. Embodying our democratic fabric, it grants every Shibizen an equitable voice in molding our shared journey. From council elections to legislative votes, the Shib token guarantees transparency and participative democracy. The recent spike in burn rate has provided the SHIB community with a newfound hope, even though the road to a significant price gain appears long. With over 500 trillion SHIB tokens still in circulation, the community is still positive about potential price gains ahead.

42391976,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfyBoT,1701185264,"Digital Euro Can End Bank Crises, Is Better Than Deposits, Ex-Bank of Spain Chief Says","Unlike bank deposits, a digital euro issued by the EU's central bank is a safe asset, former Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Fernández Ordóñez told a European Parliament committee.  Such a currency could help end economic crises, and even help deregulate banks, he said.  EU plans for a digital euro released earlier this year have faced backlash from lawmakers and the public over privacy concerns.  A digital euro, unlike bank deposits, is a safe asset and could help end bank crises or deregulate banks altogether, according to former Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Fernández Ordóñez.  Speaking at a public hearing hosted by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to discuss a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC), Ordóñez said that the last two major global economic crises arose from using risky assets like bank deposits, which aren't money but promises to return money.  ""Digital euros are euros, but bank deposits are not euros. Deposits are just promises to pay euros, and if banks can't fulfill those promises, then you get crises emerging,"" he said, adding that a CBDC would have the benefit of stability, justifying the use of the digital euro instead of bank deposits.  One of the chief concerns around CBDCs is their potential to threaten the stability of the banking sector by encouraging customers to withdraw their deposits and convert them into the CBDC. If withdrawals are large enough, it could create a liquidity crunch and other potential problems for the wider economy. To mitigate such a risk, European Union plans for a digital euro propose individual holding limits. The plans have also faced criticism from lawmakers and the public over privacy and other concerns.  Ordóñez, one of four experts testifying at the Tuesday hearing, went on to say that a digital euro could help deregulate banking activities entirely.  ""And that deregulation would have a very important impact on growth because banking is the most protected sector. The sector is subject to the most intervention of all economic sectors,"" Ordóñez said.  Conversely, a digital euro issued by the European Central Bank wouldn't need things like deposit insurance or prudential requirements, which would help improve competition, he said.  A CBDC could also let the ECB have ""direct monetary policy,"" said Ordóñez, also a former secretary of state for finance and economy for the government of Spain.  ""So the central bank wouldn't have to change interest rates and we will be able to take monetary policy decisions without having to worry about the impact on banking stability. There are other effects, for example, dealing with the centralization of financial decisions or separating monetary policy from government finances. And there's a very important effect for Europeans because if we had a digital euro, then we could have real European monetary union. What we have at the moment is just physical money, coins, notes,"" Ordóñez said.  The EU has not decided whether to issue a digital euro, and lawmaker Stefan Berger, who is in charge of shepherding the legislation through the parliament, noted during the hearing that they ""don't know the technological aspects"" of a CBDC ""or if it's going to be blockchain.""",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/28/digital-euro-can-end-bank-crises-is-better-than-deposits-ex-bank-of-spain-chief-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64fc2c324c64da60e68e4f2b47fc77a37442f5e4-1435x807.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20810447,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562834,1701183631,"Bitcoin Bull Run Is Only Just Starting, According To This Metric","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin SOPR hasn’t yet reached high levels that have been associated with heated bull market phases in the past. Bitcoin SOPR Has Only Seen Mildly Positive Values Recently In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has explained how market psychology has driven the BTC price during the past few years. The on-chain indicator that best represents the Bitcoin trader psychology according to the quant is the “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR). The SOPR basically tells us about whether the BTC investors are selling their coins (or more precisely, transferring them on the blockchain) at a net amount of profit or loss. Related Reading: Santiment Reveals Trigger Behind Bitcoin Rally: Will This Signal Reignite? When the indicator has a value greater than 1, it means that the average holder in the sector is selling their coins at some profit right now. On the other hand, a value under this threshold implies that loss-selling is dominant among the participants. Naturally, when the SOPR has a value exactly equal to 1, the overall market can be assumed to be just breaking even on their selling, as the number of profits being realized is exactly canceling out the losses. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SOPR over the past few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been slightly positive in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant In the above graph, the analyst has marked the pattern that the Bitcoin SOPR has followed in recent years. During the 2018 bear market, the BTC SOPR dropped to pretty low values below 1 following the November 2018 crash. Coinciding with these lows in the metric, the price also found its bottom. In the 2022 bear market, the BTC investors were keeping still in the red as they participated in only a relatively low amount of loss selling until the FTX crash occurred and the holders finally capitulated to a significant degree. So far, it would appear that the low after the FTX collapse was indeed the bottom for the current cycle, as BTC has only gone and doubled in value since then. The pattern of this bottom has also been consistent with the one of the 2018 bear market. In between these two major bottoms, there was also a large-scale capitulation event back in 2020, but this crash was mostly an anomaly caused by the unexpected emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. From the chart, it’s visible that the trend during rallies has generally been just the opposite: investors start selling at large profits and once the profit-taking attains extreme levels, the top is hit. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $47,000 Target For Bitcoin If This Happens Earlier this year, the BTC SOPR spiked to high levels around when BTC hit its local top in April. Since then, though, the indicator has remained relatively calm, with some mild profit-taking coming after the latest leg in the rally. “There will be many corrections and declines in the current market until it reaches the peak of the bull market, but from a psychological perspective, there still seems to be enough time left until the latter half of the bull market,” thinks the quant. BTC Price Bitcoin had registered a decline below the $37,000 level during the past day, but the asset has pulled itself back up since then as it’s just floating above the mark now.

This was revealed by the lead developer of one of the major projects building on the XRP Ledger, hinting that a MasterCard integration may be coming. Bringing MasterCard, Self-Custody, And More To XRP In a post that was shared on X (formerly Twitter), Xumm Wallet lead developer Wietse Wind excitedly announced to the community that self-custody is on the way. The announcement featured a screenshot that showed the option to make purchases with prepaid XRP, a feature that is yet to drop.

One X user asked if users would be able to link a credit card to their Xumm wallet to make purchases. The developer responded by saying “These are hardware wallets, they don’t work @ terminals and ATMs.” However, in a follow-up, the user declared “Debit cards and Xumm is all I want.” To which Wietse Wind responded that they are working on it. “Debit MasterCard, self custody, card authorization with custom on ledger limits on your account using a Hook,” Wietse Wind revealed.

One particularly recurring theme was card fees which users have come to loathe. One user John Mcclain implored the team to not have a +1% fee on charges, referencing the charges by another prominent payment platform in the XRP space, Uphold, which the user says charges a high fee. According to them, “This can really add up quick!” Related Reading: Ripple IPO May Be Delayed, Crypto Pundit Gives Reasons Why Moving to allay worries, Wietse Wind reminded users that using credit and debit cards means that there will be fees attached. This is because this is how these cards work, and also “that’s how they are able to insure, give cash backs, and make tremendous amounts of money.” However, this problem does not seem to be alien to the Xumm team as the developer revealed that running entirely separate rails would be beneficial in addressing the fees issue.

42391994,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfyCE7,1701176470,First Mover Americas: Spot Bitcoin ETFs in Brazil Find Hefty Demand,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  As investors await approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., a check in Brazil finds hefty demand for such vehicles, which have been trading there for more than two years. Together, those ETFs have $96.8 million of assets under management (AUM) as of Nov. 21, led by Hashdex's Nasdaq Bitcoin Reference Price FDI (BITH11) with $57.8 million in AUM, or a market share of about 60%. For comparison, the largest ETF in the nation, iShares Ibovespa Index (BOVA11), has $2.41 billion in AUM and the second largest, the iShares BM&FBOVESPA Small Cap (SMAL11), has $1.19 billion. The largest U.S. ETF, the SPDR S&P 500, has roughly $430 billion in AUM. According to Marcelo Sampaio, CEO and founder of Hashdex, the success of bitcoin ETFs in Brazil is the result of pro-market digital assets regulation and growing interest from large institutions.  Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao must remain in the U.S., at least for the moment, as a federal judge considers a U.S. Department of Justice motion that would require him to remain in the country until he is sentenced early next year. Zhao pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act last week and resigned as CEO of the world's largest crypto exchange by volume. The exchange itself pleaded guilty to charges of violating sanctions and money-transmission laws, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in fines and embed compliance monitors who can report back to the U.S. government. After Zhao pleaded guilty, a magistrate judge granted his release on a $175 million personal recognizance bond. Zhao put $15 million in a trust account and had three guarantors put up over $5 million in collateral to secure the bond. Under the terms of the bond release, he was free to return to the UAE, where his wife and children also reside. District Judge Richard Jones stayed this part of the ruling on Monday.  Crypto investment funds last week attracted their largest net inflows this year, extending their strongest run since the 2021 bull market as anticipation for a spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) continued to entice investors, digital asset fund management firm CoinShares reported Monday. Digital asset-focused investment vehicles saw net inflows of $346 million in the week ended Nov. 24, the largest amount in what's now been nine consecutive weeks of inflows, according to the report. ""This run, spurred by anticipation of a spot-based ETF launch in the US, is the largest since the bull market in late-2021,"" CoinShares head of research James Butterfill said.

20807481,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562840,1701176451,"Bitcoin Price Alert: $48,000 By Early January, Forecasts Proven Indicator","A recent analysis by crypto expert CryptoCon, focusing on the Ichimoku Cloud indicator, suggests a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, with a potential rally to $48,000 by early January. CryptoCon, in his latest analysis, highlighted the reliability of the Weekly Ichimoku Cloud, stating, “The Weekly Ichimoku cloud called our last Bitcoin rise to $38,000 2 months in advance with the cross projected in the future.” The analyst’s confidence stems from the indicator’s historical performance, which has reportedly signaled previous price movements with considerable accuracy – 11 weeks, 7 weeks, and 13 weeks in advance. Bitcoin Rally To $48,000 Ahead? The chart by CryptoCon’s statement delineates four distinct cycles, each marked by significant price events and the Ichimoku Cloud’s predictive crosses. The current cycle, referred to as Cycle 4 spanning from 2023 to 2026, shows a Leading Span Cross – a crucial signal within the Ichimoku Cloud methodology – pointing towards an upward trajectory. CryptoCon explains, “Now we wait for it to fill its next calls, the completion of our rise and the first target of 43k.” This anticipation is based on the observed durations from the Leading Span Cross to the respective local tops, ranging from 7 to 11 weeks, with an average of 10 weeks. If the pattern holds, the suggested timeline places the completion of this rise in early January. The analysis further emphasizes the potential for Bitcoin to reach the upper limits of the red section of the Ichimoku Cloud, also known as the “Leading Span B.” According to CryptoCon, “The most conservative level here is 43.2k, but the true top of the red cloud could be labeled as high as 48k.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Influx Of Over $1.5 Billion In 2023: Price Surge Aims For $43,000 It’s worth noting that the Ichimoku Cloud is a comprehensive indicator that provides insights into market momentum, trend direction, and support and resistance levels. The tool is highly regarded for its forward-looking capabilities, especially the “clouds,” which are projected 26 periods ahead of the current price to suggest future potential support or resistance zones. BTC Price Floor Could Be $41.200 Post Halving On a related note, Charles Edwards, the founder of Capriole Investments, provided a data-driven perspective on the future of Bitcoin’s price floor. With the next Bitcoin Halving event scheduled in April 2024, Edwards projects significant changes in the mining economics of the leading cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Santiment Reveals Trigger Behind Bitcoin Rally: Will This Signal Reignite? “In April 2024, Bitcoin’s Electrical Cost, the raw energy cost of mining Bitcoin, will double overnight. This is a certainty,” Edwards declared, drawing attention to the predictable nature of the Halving event which slashes the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions in half. This systemic shift will likely push inefficient mining operations out of the market, as they grapple with suddenly halved revenue against a backdrop of static expenses. Edwards’ analysis of past Halving events reveals a trend where the Electrical Cost—essentially the floor for Bitcoin’s price—settles at a significantly higher level post-Halving. “In the last two Halvings, Electrical Cost bottomed at +65% and +50% of the pre-Halving values,” he notes. If this pattern holds true, and the Electrical Cost bottoms at +50% this time around, it is estimated that “the historic price floor of Bitcoin will be $41.2K in just 5 months’ time.” At press time, BTC was trading in the middle of the range at $37,146. Even though BTC has broken out of the trend channel to the downside, the price is making further higher lows.

The so-called contango indicates bullish sentiment in the market.  A rare pattern recently emerged in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) futures market tied to bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH], signaling a strong investor inclination to go long or take leveraged bullish bets on the leading cryptocurrencies.  A futures contract is a legal contract to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a specified future date, called the expiry date. Usually, futures markets are in contango, a term used to describe when the price of futures rises above spot, with further-out futures drawing higher than nearer-expiration futures. An increase in buying pressure often causes the contango to widen.  BTC and ETH futures have recently experienced the same, with the so-called ""next-month"" contract trading at a notable premium to the ""front month"" contract, a rare occurrence since 2018, according to data tracked by K33 Research. The front month contract has an expiration date closest to the current date, while the next in line is called the next month contract.  ""It's telling of a very bullish sentiment on CME with a strong desire to add long exposure, leading yields [premiums] to surge,"" Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, told CoinDesk.  The CME futures in consideration are sized at five BTC and 50 ETH, respectively. As of writing, December expiry contracts could be called the front month contracts while those expiring in January represent the next month contracts. November contracts expired Monday.  The rolling weekly spread between next and front month BTC and ETH contracts recently widened to an annualized 1.5%, the first such instance since the bull market days of early 2021.  The pattern has occurred only four times to date, with three of those seen during bull runs while one a couple of weeks before the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020.  According to Lunde, contango in both markets slightly narrowed on Monday but continued to signal a bullish sentiment.  ""Yesterday saw a considerable narrowing in the contango. 7,000 BTC worth of open interest was closed on the December contract, and for ETH, last week's build-up to an all-time high notional open interest was erased after seeing a pattern similar to BTC,"" Lunde said.  ""Yields [premiums] remain well into the double digits, i.e., CME's sentiment remains very bullish,"" Lunde added.  Pear Protocol's founder Huf said that the recent widening of the contango stemmed from traditional market players taking bullish bets.  ""It indicates TradFi has a long exposure but not via spot - it's quite a vulnerable positioning - probably gets unwound on any spikes higher into a potential spot ETF approval,"" Huf told CoinDesk.  Huf added that elevated futures premiums could see renewed interest in basis trades or cash and carry arbitrage. The strategy involves buying the cryptocurrency in the spot market and simultaneously selling futures. The strategy, one of the most preferred during the 2020-2021 bull run, allows traders to pocket the premium while bypassing price volatility.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/28/cme-listed-bitcoin-ether-futures-flash-a-rare-bullish-signal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7082c0bc8a09a5527ac657aa14cf9beac27d71a7-4096x2304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bluntz recently stated in a YouTube presentation that Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL, which is a strong competitor to Ethereum (ETH), has a potential to hit the $80 level. Based on his research, Solana looks to be about to experience a significant uptick, indicating possible buying opportunities as it stands as a formidable Ethereum substitute in the cryptocurrency market. The Elliott Wave theory, a popular technical analysis approach in trading that Ralph Nelson Elliott created in the 1930s, is the main focus of Bluntz’s analysis. Elliott Wave theory states that price movements in financial markets typically follow a natural rhythm that consists of five waves that follow the trend and three waves that correct it. Bluntz said that Solana has effectively passed through its corrective phase—a pivotal point that suggests there may be a big upswing. His analysis indicates that this pattern marks the end of Solana’s declining price trend and the beginning of a new growing phase for the cryptocurrency.

After analyzing the SOL price pattern, the analyst stated that a sub-$50 entry would be excellent and that they expected the SOL price to correct. The price of Solana has been rising since mid-October 2023, and reaching its 2023 peak of $68.20 on November 16 before a decline started. AltcoinSherpa projects that the price of SOL would soar to three figures in 2024. 1/ Exciting times for the Solana community as we delve into the post-Breakpoint era! 🌐 Solana Breakpoint 2023 in Amsterdam was a game-changer, fueling a massive 140% surge in $SOL and an overall ecosystem rebound. 📈 Let’s break down the highlights! pic.twitter.com/cF2Na7a97O — CoinEx Global (@coinexcom) November 24, 2023 In a related development, CoinEx Research, the research and development arm of the CoinEx cryptocurrency exchange site, talked about the top Solana ecosystem trends in Q4 2023. The recent Solana Breakpoint 2023, a yearly Solana community event in Amsterdam, was the clear cause of the huge surge in the SOL-focused ecosystem, according to CoinEx Research. Owing to all of these elements, market analysts have projected a bullish price for Solana. By December 2023, they predict its worth to have increased to $60 or more, indicating a strong growth and potential for innovation. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

MCIs are individual firms or groups of affiliated firms that combine a broad range of services, products and functions typically centered around the operation of a trading platform, according to the FSB. This could apply to numerous crypto heavyweights, like Coinbase or Binance.  The FSB warns that crypto firms combining different activities are more vulnerable to failure and that mitigating the impact of such a failure depends on how well global crypto regulation is implemented. The report also identified ""information gaps"" that require enhanced cross-border cooperation and information sharing.  The report found that the vulnerabilities of MCIs and firms in traditional finance are not very different. However, vulnerabilities increase when MCIs engage in proprietary trading, market-making on their own trading venues, and lending and borrowing.  The FSB said there is a need to assess whether disclosures and reporting requirements of MCIs are adequately covered or would warrant additional measures.  ""Combining functions in MCIs that are typically restricted or separated for traditional finance appears prima facie inconsistent with the principle of ‘same activity, same risk, same regulation’,"" the report said.

BITX's performance has been mixed, outperforming Bitcoin and mining stocks in the short term but not meeting its 2x return goal over the longer term. Those wanting 2x upside over Bitcoin may find MicroStrategy stock to be a better alternative. The possibility of a spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETF in the United States has justifiably commanded quite a bit of attention in the headlines for much of the second half of 2023. This excitement has helped push the price of BTC up from the mid-$20k range to over $37k as of article submission: Data by YCharts To my surprise, most of the Bitcoin mining names have been completely unresponsive to this 50% surge in BTC since mid-September. However, we have seen a significant closing of the NAV discount in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) shares over the last several months. With Bitcoin bulls potentially looking for Bitcoin-proxy ideas that can be expressed in traditional investment accounts like IRAs, one may consider buying the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ). In this article, we'll look at how that fund works and determine if it's something investors should consider holding. How BITX Works Like other leveraged ETFs , BITX intends to maximize the returns from a single investment theme; in this case, long Bitcoin. As a 2x ETF, BITX is designed to double the return of Bitcoin in a single trading session. If Bitcoin increases by 2% in a day, BITX should increase by 4% if the fund performs as intended. The Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF does not directly invest in Bitcoin. Because there is no Bitcoin underlying the shares, you could argue BITX is structurally more similar to the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) than it is to something like GBTC. The relationship between BITX shares and Bitcoin comes from the CME Bitcoin futures contracts held in the fund rather than from direct exposure to the underlying asset. BITX Holdings (Volatility Shares) Similar to the ProShares fund, BITX is primarily focused on the front end months and utilizes leverage to outperform both Bitcoin and BITO on the way up. Of course, this also works against the investor on the way down and when BTC is losing against the dollar, BITX should go down twice as much. Fund Performance In a sampling of recent sessions, we can see examples of the fund delivering on the 2x return and examples of the fund returning far more than two times that of Bitcoin: Daily Return BTC BITX 11/13/23 -1.65% -3.18% 11/14/23 -2.53% -9.38% 11/15/23 6.56% 14.61% 11/16/23 -4.55% -9.18% 11/17/23 1.30% 2.87% 11/20/23 0.23% 6.61% 11/21/23 -4.60% -3.73% 11/22/23 4.68% 3.92% 11/24/23 1.18% 1.16% Source: TradingView, daily closes These are very large intraday moves and I think speak to the high degree of risk involved in holding leveraged shares. It's also important to note that Bitcoin trading is 24/7 while BITX only trades during regular market hours. Given that, it's not surprising to see large fluctuations between the fund shares and BTC day to day. However, this is just a two week sample of intraday moves. The longer term performance of the fund shares is telling. Over the course of several months, BITX has actually held up okay. For instance, since mid-September when Bitcoin last touched $25k, the price of BTC is up 45% while BITX shares are up over 117%: Data by YCharts Not only has BITX outperformed the ""2x"" goal since mid-September, but the fund has also outperformed the top two mining stocks in the equity markets as well. However, over the long haul leveraged ETFs are generally awful investments and despite its minimal trading history, I suspect BITX won't be much different. Consider total performance since the inception of the fund: Data by YCharts Since the fund's inception on June 27th, the total return from holding the 2X Bitcoin shares is a hair under 30%. While that may be ahead of Bitcoin's 24% total return over the same timeframe, it's a far cry from the 2X return that the fund strives for. And this gets us back to the major risk when holding funds like this. Risks Since the futures contracts underlying these shares are cash-settled and rolled over, the issuer never actually holds any BTC in the fund. Due in part to that constant rollover, fees for BITX do cut into the total return. The expense ratio is 1.85% - this is double that of BITO despite the collateral essentially being the same thing. As a leveraged ETF, the fund will decay over time given rebalancing and the expenses just mentioned. In my view BITX should really be used more as a very short term trading vehicle for experienced market participants rather than as a long term investment holding. Data by YCharts Interestingly, MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has outperformed both Bitcoin and BITX since the inception of the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF. And this isn't even a cherry-picked starting point. It checks out longer term as well with MSTR outperforming BTC by better than 2 to 1 year to date: Data by YCharts From a fundamental business standpoint, I don't see much reason to hold MSTR shares. But given the leverage on Bitcoin with the corporate balance sheet, MicroStrategy equity may be a better alternative to BITX for investors who want higher upside with a more long term bullish Bitcoin theme. Summary I absolutely understand the allure of BITX and can empathize with traders who would look to those shares for boosted returns over simply buying and holding BTC. As someone who likes a few of the miners for the very same reason, I understand the goal. However, I think there are better ways to look for upside against Bitcoin in a broader BTC bull run. The only place I would even entertain BITX would be in a tax-advantaged account like an IRA. In a typical brokerage, I'd say avoid it entirely. My rationale there is cryptocurrencies are a 24/7 market and proxies that live in regular market hours leave quite a bit of tactical trading utility on the table. I don't personally hold or trade BITX and can't recommend it as a long term investment. Furthermore, MSTR is acting like a 2x ETF better than BITX is. So take that for what it's worth.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4654532-2x-bitcoin-strategy-etf-juicy-returns-but-be-careful?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20803368.jpeg

20803259,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562813,1701166805,Institutional Investors Pour $346 Million Into Crypto – Here Are The Winners,"Crypto investment products have experienced another week of inflows, bringing the run to nine consecutive weeks of inflows. According to CoinShares’ latest report on digital asset investment funds, inflows into crypto products totaled $346 million last week, with some cryptos receiving more investments than others. With last week’s numbers, the total value of inflows into crypto investment funds this year now stands at $1.663 billion. Overview Of Institutional Investment In Crypto This Week Although volatile and still in its nascent phase, the crypto market has attracted its fair share of rich visionaries and institutional traders. While companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla are investing on the spot end of things by buying crypto assets, others are getting exposure to assets through exchange-traded products (ETPs). This is particularly good, as institutional backing in ETPs also brings more stability and legitimacy to the space. Related Reading: Ripple IPO May Be Delayed, Crypto Pundit Gives Reasons Why According to CoinShares, Bitcoin has attracted most of the inflows. Bitcoin has been in the spotlight for the past few months, particularly with Spot Bitcoin ETFs waiting to be approved in the US. Bitcoin ETPs received a total of $312 million in new inflows last week, bringing its total inflows this year to $1.55 billion. At the same time, Ethereum ETPs witnessed an inflow of $33.5 million, a 915% increase from the previous week’s inflows of $3.3 million. Solana ETPs on the other hand, saw an inflow of $3.5 million, a 74% drop from the previous week’s inflow of $13.6 million. Polkadot and Chainlink also saw inflows of $0.8 million and $0.6 million respectively. On the other hand, short Bitcoin products had outflows of $0.9 million last week, a third consecutive week of outflows. What Is Driving The Institutional Interest? Institutional investments in digital asset products are now at the highest point since the bull market in late 2021. According to CoinShares, the total assets under management (AuM) are now at $45.3 billion. Most of the momentum for this surge came after the announcement of applications of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Applications of spot Ethereum ETFs joined the list last week, spiking the flurry of inflows into Ethereum ETPs last week to extend a positive four-week run of $103 million. Related Reading: Road To $1: Why Did Terra Classic (USTC) Rise 300% In One Day? ETPs are still one of the best ways for institutional investors to get exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their use has been on the rise in recent months, and ETP volumes as a percentage of total spot Bitcoin reached 18% last week.

(1MDB) scandal that was uncovered in 2015. Goldman Sachs ended up being fined $2.9 billion in 2020.  ""No, Lloyd got to retire with his stock options intact, and GS was not deemed criminally responsible,"" he continued, also pointing out that CEOs of major banks weren't prosecuted for the 2008 financial crisis.  Hayes argues that the treatment of CZ and Binance is indicative of resistance against decentralization and the blockchain revolution, which, he said, directly challenge state power.  ""The state powers centralization, and collaboration is achieved through threats of violence,"" he wrote. ""A problem for the financial and political establishment was that the intermediaries facilitating flows into and out of the industrial revolution named blockchain were not run by members of their class.""  Hayes himself is no stranger to state prosecution. In February 2022, he pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act because he willfully failed to implement an anti-money laundering (AML) program at the exchange.

In a post on X, he starts by noting the market’s recent cool-off, suggesting this phase is creating new opportunities for savvy investors. Deutscher also emphasizes the importance of staying informed and ready to capitalize on these shifts. Top Altcoins To Watch This Week Injective (INJ) According to Deutscher, Injective (INJ) is experiencing a lull in hype, but this should not undermine its strong performance throughout the year. He believes that if the bullish momentum continues, INJ could reach its local highs in the $19’s. “Monitoring closely, as it runs hard when it runs,” Deutscher states, highlighting the potential for rapid gains. At press time, INJ was trading at $15.88 after being rejected at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level of $17.13. Pyth Network (PYTH) Deutscher points out that PYTH is in an interesting position with attributes favored by the market: it’s a new, shiny coin with a low float and perpetual contracts. However, competition from other Solana tokens, like Jupiter and JITO, may temporarily divert attention. For those already holding PYTH, Deutscher advises to hold but not to add more unless the price drops.

Despite its volatile funding, Deutscher sees potential for a FOMO-driven price increase. “It could be one of those ‘it’s already up too much, I’m not buying’ plays,” he speculates, suggesting that late buyers might drive the price even higher. Cosmos (ATOM) The recent approval of the ATOM Halving proposal is a significant development for Cosmos. This change will halve the maximum inflation rate from 20% to 10%, potentially impacting ATOM’s price action (PA). Deutscher is watching this closely for signs of a developing trend. Related Reading: Market Watch: These 5 Altcoins Are Poised For Breakouts, Says Crypto Expert dYdX (DYDX) The unlocking of $524 million worth of DYDX on November 28th is a crucial event, especially since these tokens will be released on the DYDX chain, not supported by centralized exchanges (CEXs). Deutscher anticipates a complex interplay of market psychology around this event. “Watching to see if the head and shoulders pattern continues to play out,” he comments, suggesting possible price movements following the unlock. Solana (SOL) And BONK SOL’s struggle to break past $58 is noted by Deutscher, placing it in a “no trade zone” for now. However, a breakthrough could lead to significant gains. BONK, a Solana-based meme coin, is also on his radar due to its higher volatility and correlation with Solana’s movements. Vertex (VRTX) Finally, Deutscher highlights the significant volume increase on Vertex, surpassing DYDX and Uniswap. Despite suspicions of wash trading due to low open interest (OI) compared to volume, he sees potential in Vertex and perceives a resurgence in the popularity of perpetual decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

42391965,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfyAu3,1701160020,"Dogecoin Now Held at 5M Crypto Addresses, Though Concentration Remains a Concern","The adoption of joke cryptocurrency dogecoin [DOGE] continues to grow two years after the coronavirus pandemic that supposedly saw people beat lockdown boredom by gambling millions in non-serious digital assets.  The number of cryptocurrency addresses holding DOGE has topped 5 million for the first time, according to data tracked by on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock.  Meanwhile, the number of active addresses on the network has more than doubled to 168,000, reaching the most since March 2022, and the number of confirmed transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain has jumped to the highest since June, with the tally increasing by 1,000% in the past 10 days.  While these figures stand out, the concentration of ownership in DOGE remains an issue. According to BitInfoCharts, fewer than 5,000 addresses control more than 80% of DOGE's supply, which means a relatively few traders have control over the cryptocurrency's price.  DOGE's market capitalization has risen 14% to almost $11 billion this month. Greater adoption and usage of cryptocurrency often translate into higher market value.  Dogecoin gained notoriety in early 2021 after Elon Musk tweeted memes based on the coin, inspiring the creation of other dog-themed tokens like Shiba Inu.

The program will trial an apparent global first in which Aussie crypto users who activate two-factor authentication on their cryptocurrency accounts will be paid AUD 10 (USD 6.6) worth of Bitcoin. It has been launched to coincide with the Australian government's Scam Awareness Week (Nov. 27th to Dec. 1st). The trial will test the impact on investment fraud levels of rewarding crypto customers for protecting their accounts and educating themselves about how to avoid scams, the announcement said.  Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process requiring two forms of identification to access resources. The method provides a higher level of security than single-factor processes, in which the user provides a single form of identification, usually a password or passcode.  Ever since the collapse of FTX, Australia has taken steps to tighten its crypto regulation policy. The year 2023 has seen Australian regulators take action against crypto-related companies such as Block Earner and eToro. Blockchain industry stakeholders in Australia have taken a stand against restrictions on crypto payments by local banks. The Commonwealth Bank (CBA) was one such platform that applied partial restrictions citing scams. Binance Australia also halted deposits and withdrawals by bank transfer ""due to a decision made"" by a third-party payment service provider. Australia's government and the Blockchain industry then appeared to have reached a compromise.  In 2022, Aussies reported a loss of AUD 221 million (USD 146 million) in cryptocurrency, an increase of 162.4% from the previous year, according to the announcement. This year, Swyftx has stopped AUD 3 million in customer funds from going to scammers.  The initial 2,000 customers who enable two-factor authentication on their accounts and complete a course co-created with TRM Labs will be paid the reward by Swyftx. The partnership also encourages customers to report suspected fraud on chainabuse.com, a free scam-reporting website operated by TRM Labs. Customers can check addresses before engaging with them on the website.  Australia expects to release draft legislation that covers licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers by 2024.

There have been a lot of ups and downs, from a small rise in March to a huge surge in July and another one in the middle of October. Even though this exciting adventure has ended, XRP is now trading at a mere $0.59, a huge drop of 30% from its all-time high of $0.95. Related Reading: The Dogecoin Surge: Unveiling The Catalyst Behind Rising Transactions Despite this, the current trajectory of XRP showcases a prolonged consolidative pattern spanning multiple months, hinting at a potential windfall for patient investors. For instance, a bullish head-and-shoulders setup is on the brink of completion, adding a positive dimension to the outlook. XRP: Buy The Dip? In the event that the XRP price maintains its upward momentum and successfully breaches resistance, the stage is set for a rapid and substantial rally to the upside, presenting a tantalizing opportunity for those positioned to capitalize on the potential gains. After looking at the current situation, it looks like XRP is definitely in the “buy the dip” sector. If you think that XRP will continue to rise in value, buying some of the digital asset right now might seem like a great chance to make a lot of money. People who believe that XRP will go up in value over the long term see investing in it now as a good deal. XRP market cap currently at $32.2 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Even in the face of the recent correction within the cryptocurrency market and the marginal dip in XRP’s price, certain analysts maintain an optimistic stance, suggesting that Ripple’s coin is poised for a surge to unprecedented heights. #XRP The Train 🚂Next Stops: $1.3-$3-$5.8-$27: 🔍 Macro View: Reviving echoes from the 2017 surge, aiming for $27 feels like a plausible target.

These ambitious goals… https://t.co/Aojv3sYmtG pic.twitter.com/c0RSHhlFnA — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 27, 2023 Notably, Twitter user EGRAG CRYPTO stands as an example, outlining the potential upcoming targets for the token, signaling a prevailing belief in the latent upward potential despite recent market fluctuations. EGRAG said that XRP could go up to $6 or $7 if it went above the “crucial milestones” of $3 and $5.80. Based on how it did during the 2017 bull run, the expert went on to say that he thought the token would explode to $27. In the current wave of market optimism, XRP is actively participating, driven by growing anticipation surrounding ETFs and witnessing the most substantial surge in inflows since late 2021. Based on the latest report from CoinShares, digital asset investment products saw an impressive $346 million influx in the previous week alone. Significantly, this marks the highest weekly inflow during a nine-week streak, sparked by heightened expectations of a spot-based ETF launch in the United States. Notably, this surge is notably the most robust since the bull market observed in late 2021. This bull run will be a special one for $XRP Last cycle we saw HEAVY suppression & inactivity due to the whole lawsuit issue But things have changed since then In fact, change might be an understatement As Ripple has flipped this around into the most BULLISH outcome possible… pic.twitter.com/PzDsPVAyyO — Kyren (@noBScrypto) November 24, 2023 Positive Forecast For XRP Meanwhile, another Twitter user who thinks Ripple’s coin is going to have a huge surge soon is Kyren.

The re-listing of XRP on key cryptocurrency exchanges, Ripple’s engagement with several central banks worldwide, and the company’s winning streak in its legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are a few of these.

20791486,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562741,1701140438,"$3.1 Billion TUSD Stablecoin Shaky, Briefly Depegs—What’s Happening?","TrueUSD (TUSD), a stablecoin with a market cap exceeding $3.1 billion, appears “shaky” and briefly depegged on November 22, dropping to as low as $0.9976 before restoring its peg. The temporary depeg was attributed to a deluge of selling orders, according to Kaiko, a blockchain analytics firm. TUSD Briefly Depegs, Large Selling Orders Rolling Through Riyad Carey, a researcher at Kaiko, noted that large sell orders, including one for $3 million, triggered the turbulence that caused the stablecoin’s price to dip below the dollar peg. This brief deviation resulted in users who redeemed TUSD receiving less USD. Ideally, any redemption of a fiat-backed stablecoin should result in a 1:1 reception of the collateral. The incident highlights the potential impact of large order blocks on liquidity and the potential for slippage. TUSD, theoretically backed by USD and issued by TrustToken, is popular in Binance, an exchange that delisted USDC and 2023. Because of this limitation, TUSD is one of the most liquid stablecoins paired with leading coins like Bitcoin (BTC). However, despite its popularity, it trails Tether (USDT), the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap. The TEURO Mystery This depegging occurred a few weeks after tough security questions were raised about TUSD. In mid-October, the minter was forced to disclaim TEURO, a token deployed from the same address, suggesting that private keys associated with TUSD may have been compromised. Related Reading: Circle And SBI Holdings Partnership To Boost USDC In Japan Curiously, funds tied to TEURO, the fake token, were also linked to the deployment of TCNY, another fake token unaffiliated with TrueUSD. Following these incidents, the community began raising questions about the security of the stablecoin and, more importantly, its underlying infrastructure. This was expected, considering that a centralized entity issues TUSD though all transactions are on-chain. Despite these challenges, TrueUSD maintains that its smart contracts are secure. The company emphasizes that it has gained ownership of the TUSD minting contract since the end of 2020. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $47,000 Target For Bitcoin If This Happens In early May 2023, TUSD depegged, rising to as high as $1.20 on multiple exchanges, particularly on Binance. This was attributed to an increase in activity on the SUI farming pool. Still, this is not the first time popular stablecoins have depegged. In March 2023, USDC and DAI, two of the world’s largest stablecoins, depegged, leading to widespread fear in the market. However, the team restored parity. Moreover, to improve confidence, stablecoin issuers regularly publish attestation reports.

Observing recent trends, ADA appears to be in a bearish phase. In the last 24 hours, mainly, the asset has witnessed a 2.8% decline, resulting in its trading price falling to $0.37. However, despite the current dip, Ali offers an optimistic outlook, suggesting that Cardano may be gearing up for a significant price surge, possibly reaching its highest point for the year. Related Reading: History Repeats? Cardano (ADA) Set To Skyrocket In December, Predicts Analyst Analyst’s Positive Outlook On ADA: Understanding The Demand Zone In an X post uploaded earlier today, Ali shared his analysis on ADA, highlighting a crucial demand zone around the $0.37 and $0.38 marks. The analyst notes the substantial buying activity in this range, with over 166,470 wallets having purchased ADA at these levels. Ali states this robust demand indicates a strong support level at these price marks. With minimal resistance ahead, Ali’s analyst suggests that ADA could see an increase, potentially surpassing its yearly high of $0.4518. Notably, while the analyst points out that the current buying trend at the demand zone is a positive indicator of ADA’s strength, the analyst also cautions investors to remain vigilant. A failure to maintain support in this zone could result in ADA’s price dropping to lower levels, such as $0.34. #Cardano sits at a key demand zone between $0.37 and $0.38. Here, 166,470 wallets acquired 4.88 billion $ADA. With minimal resistance ahead and solid support below, remaining above this zone could pave the way for $ADA to climb to new yearly highs. Still, watch out, as losing… pic.twitter.com/GDjhspFSVr — Ali (@ali_charts) November 27, 2023 Cardano (ADA) Latest Price Action Recently, ADA has experienced a downturn, with its value decreasing nearly 5% over the past week. This downward trend has continued in the last 24 hours, with a 2.5% decline, bringing its trading price to roughly $0.378. This price point is significant as it aligns with the strong support level identified by analyst Ali. As highlighted above, according to Ali, a drop below this support level could potentially lead to a further decrease to around $0.34. Conversely, if ADA stabilizes or rebounds from this level, it may set the stage for a climb to new yearly highs. While ADA has faced a bearish phase recently, a broader perspective reveals a more positive outlook. Over the past month, ADA has demonstrated a 29% increase, and even considering the past two weeks, it maintains a 3.2% gain.

It reached a new record for the year, surging to a new yearly high of $38,390 on Friday. $312 Million Inflows Amid Spot-Based ETF Expectations The latest report from CoinShares provides further evidence of Bitcoin’s robustness. Despite concerns that the regulatory feud involving Binance might trigger a sell-off of BTC, the report reveals a significant influx of capital into digital asset investment products. Last week, these products witnessed a notable inflow of $346 million, marking the largest weekly inflows observed during a nine-week consecutive run. The CoinShares report highlights that the surge in inflows can be attributed to the anticipation surrounding the potential launch of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, which has been eagerly awaited by investors but delayed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Cosmos Co-Founder’s Controversial Proposal Triggers 11% Plunge In ATOM Interestingly, this surge is the largest since the bull market of late 2021. CoinShares reports that the combination of rising prices and inflows has pushed total Assets Under Management (AuM) to $45.3 billion, the highest level seen in over a year and a half. Bitcoin’s inflows last week amounted to $312 million, bringing year-to-date inflows to just over $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, short-sellers are capitulating, with outflows totaling $0.9 million for the third consecutive week. Since the peak in April 2023, AuM has declined by 61%. The use of exchange-traded Products (ETPs) to gain exposure to the asset class remains significant, with ETP volumes representing 18% of total spot Bitcoin volumes last week. Ethereum (ETH) also experienced a positive shift in sentiment, with inflows of $34 million last week and a four-week run of $103 million. This marks a turnaround from the outflows observed earlier this year. Furthermore, other cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Chainlink (LINK) saw inflows totaling $3.5 million, $0.8 million, and $0.6 million, respectively. Ichimoku Cloud Predicts Bitcoin Surge To $43,000 In a bold prediction backed by technical analysis, renowned crypto analyst “Crypto Con” suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) is poised for a significant surge in the coming weeks. Crypto Con claims to have accurately predicted BTC’s previous rise to $38,000 two months before it occurred, using the weekly Ichimoku cloud. Now all eyes are on the completion of the current upward move, with the initial target set at $43,000. For further context, the Ichimoku cloud is a popular technical indicator used to gauge potential future price trends and identify key support and resistance levels. According to Crypto Con, the weekly Ichimoku cloud has projected a bullish cross shortly, indicating that Bitcoin’s upward trajectory is far from over. Based on historical data, Crypto Con notes that the completion of previous Bitcoin rallies following a similar cross has taken anywhere from 7 to 11 weeks, with an average duration of 10 weeks. Consequently, the analyst expects the current move to culminate in early January. Related Reading: Circle And SBI Holdings Partnership To Boost USDC In Japan When the rise reaches its peak, Crypto Con suggests that the top of the red cloud, a key feature of the Ichimoku cloud, becomes the primary target. While the analyst identifies $43,200 as the most conservative level for this target, Crypto Con asserts that the red cloud’s true top could reach as high as $48,000.

This development suggests that the address believes the token may edge higher in the coming trading days or weeks, extending gains after a sharp leg up on November 22 when UNI soared, breaking above key resistance levels. Whale Loading Up More UNI, Back To $10? According to recent Lookonchain data, an Ethereum address, stevu.eth, withdrew 311,302 UNI worth $1.93 million from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, on November 25, pushing its total UNI holdings to 511,301 UNI, or $3.18 million.

However, the recent accumulative behavior on November 25 indicates that the whale is bullish on UNI, possibly expecting prices to float back to $10, a level last seen in August 2022. Presently, UNI is trading within a bullish breakout formation, looking at the performance in the daily chart. Changing hands at around $6.2 when writing on November 27, the token is up approximately 60% from October lows. Even with the confidence, UNI prices have been mostly consolidating, moving horizontally at spot rates. If buyers press on, a close above $6.6 with expanding volumes might confirm buyers of November 22. In that case, the resulting momentum might form the base for another leg up, pushing the token to August 22 highs of around $10. Uniswap v4 Expectations The whale’s confidence in UNI aligns with the ongoing development of Uniswap v4, an upgrade that will significantly enhance the DEX. In this update scheduled for a tentative period in 2024, Uniswap Labs, the team behind Uniswap, is introducing a concept called “hooks.” Hooks are contracts that can be executed at various stages of a pool’s lifecycle. According to the team, Hooks, which act as more plugins, provide increased flexibility and customization for Uniswap’s liquidity pools. As such, it would be possible for users to enable features like dynamic fees, refined market making, and even advanced orders executed on-chain.

All Uniswap liquidity pools will reside inside a single, smart contract in this design change. The team notes that this can significantly reduce gas costs and, more importantly, reduce routing efficiency across numerous pools.

20786453,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=562675,1701129651,Santiment Reveals Trigger Behind Bitcoin Rally: Will This Signal Reignite?,"The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has explained how Tether (USD) and USD Coin (USDC) exchange inflows preceded the recent Bitcoin rally. Bitcoin Rally May Restart If Stablecoins See Further Exchange Deposits In a new post on X, Santiment discussed the trend in the supply of exchanges of various assets in the cryptocurrency sector. The “supply on exchanges” is an indicator that keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating supply of the given coin currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $47,000 Target For Bitcoin If This Happens The below chart shows the trend in this indicator for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Polygon (MATIC), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC) over the past few months. The data for the exchange supply of the different coins | Source: Santiment on X Depending on what type of asset it is, the significance of the supply on exchanges can differ. In the case of volatile assets like Bitcoin, the supply being stored on these platforms may be considered the available selling supply of the asset, as one of the main reasons investors may deposit their coins to the exchanges is for selling. Thus, when this indicator trends up for these cryptocurrencies, it’s a potential sign that selling pressure in the sector is going up. The graph shows that Polygon has seen 0.7% of its supply move to exchanges in the past month, which could be a bearish sign for its price. On the other hand, Bitcoin has observed withdrawals equivalent to 0.33% of its supply during the same period. Such a decline in the indicator can suggest that investors may participate in accumulation, as they are taking their coins off towards self-custodial wallets. As for the stablecoins, an increase in the supply on exchanges also suggests that investors wish to swap these tokens. This selling of stables, though, actually provides a buying boost to the volatile side of the market, as the investors may use these assets to shift into Bitcoin and others. As the chart shows, both Tether and USD Coin saw the exchange supply rise between August and October. More specifically, USDT and USDC observed 3.54% and 0.72% of their supplies moving into these platforms, respectively. “These transfers were the predecessor to the crypto-wide rally from late October to mid-November,” explains Santiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETF Will Bring $70 Billion In New Money To Trigger Price Rally – Glassnode In the past month, however, 3.1% of the Tether supply has left these platforms, while the USD Coin has observed the metric move sideways. This would suggest that buying pressure has stopped rising, and the opposite may occur. “After a cooldown, USDT & USDC returning to exchanges will be crucial to seeing market caps continuing to increase for a big final 5 weeks of 2023,” notes the analytics firm.
