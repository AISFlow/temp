42398727,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRJQ,1444258770,"Lightning, Duplex and the Search for Scalable Bitcoin Micropayments","Like most emerging technologies, bitcoin exists in a gap between what could be possible should the technology mature and its abilities today.  For instance, there may be no older and bigger 'buried treasure' use case for bitcoin than its ability to serve as a protocol for micropayments. Compared to credit cards and PayPal, the latter of which defines a micropayment as less than roughly $5https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/micropayments, bitcoin is divisible into 100 million smaller units called Satoshis, valued at $0.000002 at today's price levels.  Proponents have long theorized that this divisibility, coupled with a wider adoption of bitcoin, could create conditions under which all manner of digital media, now largely subsidized by advertising and events, might be paid for through bitcoin micropayments.  Estimates seeking to quantify the size of this untapped market are so far scarce, though Wedbush Securities has forecasted bitcoin micropayments could be a $925bn market by 2025. ""Previously impractical, electronic payments of <$1 could broadly change content monetization on the web, possibly supplanting ads,"" a July report theorized.  However, despite this promise, the network today can't send satoshis at an affordable price.  ""The first day you read the [Bitcoin white] paper, you're like 'Oh amazing micropayments,' then you realize it doesn't work at all,"" developer Thaddeus Dryja told CoinDesk.  Users who want to send one-tenth of a cent ($0.001 US dollar or 400 Satoshis) through the bitcoin network, for example, can't do so. Today, the minimum output size is 5,430 Satoshis, or about 1.3 cents, which would incur a mining fee of 2 or 3 cents.  ""Your fee is 200%+ of your actual payment,"" Dryja noted.  Still, Dryja is one of the developers seeking to bring about a future where bitcoin's technology can fulfill its promise. As the co-creator of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, first proposed in February, Dryja and Joseph Poon kickstarted a conversation about how bitcoin's technology could be upgraded with payment channels.  In its simplest form, a payment channel would allow a user to send a certain amount of bitcoin, say $10, to a multisig wallet controlled by two parties. The channel is represented on the blockchain, and an initial funding balance is established. Balances would then adjust between parties as they transact and bitcoin's nLockTime parameter would ensure that before a specified time, balances could not be entered into a block.  The developers argue that this system replicates many positive benefits of bitcoin – finalizing transactions against the ledger without requiring a trusted third party, while allowing the majority of such exchanges to take place off of the main blockchain, which currently capped at 1MB of data per block.  The Lightning team isn't the only group of developers working to propose how payments channels would work on the blockchain, however. A similar proposal was put forth by researchers are the Distributed Computing Group of ETH Zurich in a September white paper on Duplex Micropayment Channels (DMC).  Both proposals have come to be viewed as ones that could scale the bitcoin network for if and when user demand increases in line with speculation, keeping the size of bitcoin's blocks lower and limiting the size of the bitcoin blockchain so nodes can store full versions more efficiently.  Lightning development progresses  As the earliest and most prominent iteration of this idea, Lightning is now supported in part by Blockstream, a startup that raised $21m in funding in late 2014 for its signature sidechains project, which seeks to enable interoperability between blockchains.  Blockstream core tech engineer Rusty Russell, who joined the company in March, is now working full time on the Lightning network. Unaffiliated with the startup or its funding, Dryja and Poon are currently seeking to develop a formal business entity around the project.  In interview, Dryja and Poon suggested that, despite assertions project development could take years, Lightning could take as little as six months to be ready for launch.  Both stressed they are seeking for Lightning to be decentralized, and that this is the primary complicating factor in terms of rollout.  ""What is really taking up time and why we have to do it right is you have to make it so that it's open access in order to participate and that it's easy to participate across the spectrum of how you want to participate,"" Poon said, adding:  ""It can't be a system that centralizes, Lightning needs to exist in such a way that everyone can participate and run a node.""  In practice, that means crafting the rules for how two parties can transact in the system, overcoming adjustments that need to be made to the protocol and establishing how data moves between parties.  First in its order of challenges is create a system of two-hop payments, whereby two users can establish recurring payments within a channel, and these communications can pass through one or more additional intermediary nodes.  ""That's the minimal case where this is starting to be the Lightning,"" Poon continued.  The parties then need to be able to prove to each other that a transaction occurred, within a certain period of time. Further, either party will need to settle terms, with penalties coded to ensure that contracts are followed, without such communications being interrupted by intermediaries.  This is a challenge as data needed to process the payments would route through an unknown node operator.  ""Let's say you wanted to pay for an article, you would be connected to some random node on the network. They'd be connected to someone else and then it routes through random computers on the Internet,"" Poon explained.  Versions of Lightning are currently being created in C, Java, Go and Python, and according to developers, code is operational.  ""Right now people are kicking the tires, in terms of user testing and having spending between each other,"" Dryja said, adding that such experimentation is ongoing on Testnet3, an alternative blockchain that replicates network conditions without using real bitcoins.  Larger network improvements  One speed bump to the Lightning vision is that soft forks are required for it to be implemented. Less stringent than a hard fork, such as would be required with an increase to the blocksize, soft forks only require a majority of miners upgrade their software to comply with new rules.  In his April evaluation of the white paper, Russell noted soft forks would be required to protect against transaction malleability issues and allow new signature modes. Additionally, he noted that a rating system would need to be devised for Lightning nodes, wallets would need to be made interoperable with the network and a server implementation would have to be created.  Transaction malleability  , the process by which transactions can be altered before entering a block of data on the blockchain, is also an issue, though one the team is confident will be solved by the development community.  ""You could build Lightning today, but what happens is that funds could be held up by one of the parties and locking up funds is not sufficient. It creates a hostage scenario. You want to minimize trust in the system,"" Poon said.  Additional updates could be made to bitcoin's scripting language to circumvent a malleability fix. Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs), which would allow payments to be routed across untrusted parties, yet only be executed when the recipient provides a unique hash to the sender, need proposed updates such as CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.  After the soft forks are updated (a process they said should be ""measured in months""), the team suggested wallets providers would need to perform updates necessary for Lightning to be used, a process they acknowledged could take longer.  Both suggested a routing protocol that would govern how nodes process information would also take significant development effort.  DMC emerges  Elsewhere, in Europe, the Duplex payment system is working toward similar goals. ETH Zurich's Christian Decker and Professor Roger Wattenhofer, best known for research on the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, proposed DMC in September to lesser fanfare than Lightning.  Decker sees Lightning and DMC as the first proposals that would allow ""secure off-blockchain routed payments"", though there are differences in each approach. A core variation, Decker said, is that while Lightning requires that private keys be exchanged to change a state of the contract, DMC uses decreasing timelocks.  In essence, DMC proposes that payment channel agreements can be updated by changing the time at which they are scheduled to be committed to the blockchain, rather than exchanging private keys to invalidate transactions.  ""Transactions representing a later state simply have smaller timelocks that allow them to be valid before the old state is valid,"" he explained.  Decker argues that this would allow DMC to be more easily audited. ""This is a core difference to Lightning where the components are tightly coupled and are not usable individually,"" he said.  Like Lightning, DMC would also require a malleability fix to be implemented. Decker has also submitted a bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP), currently in draft, that would allow unsigned transactions to be built upon with subsequent updates.  According to the researchers, the implementation is currently moving forward and will be open sourced when a working proof-of-concept has been developed.  Off-blockchain micropayments  Both projects stand in contrast to other methods that micropayments are being made possible today. For example, tipping platform ChangeTip conducts its bitcoin tipping off-chain, while social network ZapChain uses BlockCypher to dynamically insert small transactions.  More top secret and potentially more impactful is a project in the works at bitcoin startup 21 Inc, which has so far raised the most VC funding in the industry.  In November, 21 announced it would release a ""Bitcoin Computer"" that aims to provide small amounts of bitcoin to users continuously through an embedded mining chip. As expressed in the company's communications, the miner is not meant to be speculative, but to encourage developers to create apps and inventions that need bitcoin to operate.  ""Specifically, we want to make it possible for you to turn your bright idea into passive income by selling bitcoin­-payable goods, games and services over the Internet through a 21 Bitcoin Computer,"" CEO Balaji Srinivasan wrote at the time of the product's unveiling.  Key to its functionality is a built-in ""21 micropayments server"", a feature whose impact Srinivasan hinted at on Twitter.    .@derosetech @manan19 @StartupLJackson The goal: flick on a new paid internet service like you turn on a new lightbulb. No ads, no signup.        — Balaji S. Srinivasan (@balajis) September 22, 2015      How exactly such microtransactions would interact with the blockchain is unclear, though such transactions may take place off-chain, or within 21 Inc's ecosystem, only to be applied to the blockchain later. Both Poon and Dryja said they had not been contacted so far by the company.  Regardless of 21's ambitions, however, both developers suggested they believe improvements to bitcoin's core technology are needed.  ""Most people, not super technical people, think bitcoin already does this stuff. In 2013, there was a lot of press, people were saying zero-fee, free transactions, micropayments. Bitcoin doesn't really do that,"" Dryja said, concluding:  ""A lot of people thought you can do a lot of things with bitcoin and we need to deliver on that.""

42398728,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRLO,1444236987,Royal Bank of Scotland Trialing In-House Cryptocurrency,"Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is experimenting with its own in-house cryptocurrency, says the bank's technology chief.  RBS is a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, which also includes NatWest and large Irish commercial bank Ulster Bank.  Neil Bellamy, head of technology, media and telecoms, told The Memo that RBS had created, traded and settled its currency between the group's banks.  Commenting on the potential of blockchain technology, Bellamy added:  ""It's a pipe dream, but imagine if you could take a distributed ledger system and put it in a back office and do away with a lot of that legacy infrastructure. A lot of people think we're going to be very wary and defensive or shy away from some of this newer cryptocurrency [sic] but I think the actual process and the sentiment behind it could be very exciting.""  In the report, Bellamy also said that a cryptocurrency company had used one of RBS' technology solution centres – utilized by businesses to test the viability of their products in a life-like environment – to test their bitcoin distributed ledger technology.  The reports come after RBS's chief administrative officer, Simon McNamara announced that the bank was trialling Ripple technology as part of its £3.5bn technological revamp in June and the bank partnered with distributed ledger startup R3 CEV last month.

42398734,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgRQJ,1444216969,5 Mainstream Finance Figures Embracing the Blockchain,"Just last week, distributed ledger startup R3CEV triggered a wave of excitement when it announced an additional 13 banks had joined its project to bring blockchain technology to Wall Street.  With a total of 22 banking partners, R3CEV's announcement is the latest sign that blockchain technology is enjoying increasing popularity among the world's biggest banks – some of which had gone public with their interest in it in the past – but the truth is that blockchain technology seems to have everyone talking.  Who's said what and why? CoinDesk has rounded up some of the most interesting crypto-related comments made by figures from the world of finance.  1. Jamie Dimon  Jamie Dimon, the chairman and president of JP Morgan Chase reportedly worth $1.1bn, is notorious for his skeptical comments about bitcoin made during an interview with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin, during which he told the reporter that the digital currency was ""a terrible store of value"" that could be replicated ""over and over"".  In April this year, Dimon spoke about bitcoin again, commenting on the digital currency in his annual letter to JP Morgan shareholders:  ""You all have read about bitcoin, merchants building their own networks, PayPal and PayPal look-alikes. Payments are a critical business for us – and we are quite good at it. But there is much for us to learn in terms of real-time systems, better encryption techniques and a reduction of costs and 'pain points' for customers.""  More recently, the financial bigwig spoke about bitcoin and its underlying distributed ledger during a 40-minute question-and-answer session at the Barclays Global Finance Services Conference.  During his talk, Dimon alluded to the fact that blockchain technology was enjoying increasing attention from many of the world's banks. He said: ""We have a study group on this whole thing. I think most of the banks do at this point.""  2. Blythe Masters  Blythe Masters, a former JP Morgan senior executive – who famously swapped Wall Street for a crypto startup earlier this year – has spoken about the potential of blockchain technology on various occasions.  Masters, credited with creating the credit default swap, said she had been initially surprised by the way in which blockchain technology could potentially solve many of the issues currently plaguing the financial system at Consensus 2015 – CoinDesk's inaugural conference, held in New York.  Earlier in the year, Masters spoke at the Exponential Finance Conference and said:  ""Distributed ledger technology does have the potential to be disruptive of certain business models. But it has at least as much potential to be enormously empowering of existing business models in terms of making them lower cost, more efficient and less risky.""  3. Mariano Belinky  Speaking to CoinDesk, back in April, the managing director at Santander InnoVentures – the megabank's venture capital fund – shared his his opinion on cryptocurrency technology and commented on why he thought consumer adoption did not currently matter.  Like many of his contemporaries, Belinky emphasised the potential of bitcoin's underlying distributed ledger:  ""We shouldn't be focused on the adoption of a digital currency. The underlying technology is a powerful one and I think that we will see adoption of that technology much sooner.""  Following this, Belinky toldBusiness Insiderthat the bank hadidentified 20 to 25 use caseswhere blockchain technology could be applied.  4. Debra Brackeen  The global head at Citi's Innovation Center also discussed bitcoin and its underlying technology during her session at Consensus 2015, noting that there had been a transition from speaking about the digital currency to now focusing on blockchain technology.  She said:  ""I don't know whether I would agree that banks have been quick to engage. If the world is moving faster than you, then that's a big disadvantage. I think there is a general trend, specifically about blockchain. I think there is every reason for financial institutions and banks to be looking at this [blockchain technology].""  5. Alex Batlin  Swiss investment bank UBS surprised many earlier this year when it announced plans to open a blockchain research lab in London's Canary Wharf district.  Alex Batlin, the former engineer heading up UBS' London-based blockchain innovation lab, told CoinDesk:  ""In principle it's [blockchain technology] probably one of the biggest confluences of technology and business right now.""
