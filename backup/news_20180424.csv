The company used the OP_Return feature in bitcoin's protocol to insert the characters, creating 68 invalid transactions as a result. Due to the nature of the blockchain, this flag is now forever preserved on the cryptocurrency's ledger.  ""We love finding new ways to use emerging technology. So we decided to have a little fun and plant our flag. Okay – technically, we embedded it,"" the broker said, adding:  ""With a part of the blockchain called OP_Return, which functions like the memo space on a check, simple messages and characters can be placed within transactions on the blockchain. By linking 68 individual transactions, with 80 characters per transaction, we were able to create the larger image.""  No bitcoins were actually transferred through these transactions, according to data from Blockchain.info.  OP_Return was first introduced in 2013 as a way for users to include some messages in the blockchain. However, the Bitcoin Core 0.9 release notably stated that developers were not endorsing data storage in the blockchain, saying that ""storing arbitrary data in the blockchain is still a bad idea; it is less costly and far more efficient to store non-currency data elsewhere.""  The official bitcoin wiki page notes that OP_Return can be used to convey information.  ""We’re proud to be part of it. Forever,"" the broker wrote.

The House Rules Committee voted to approve the measure – which as CoinDesk previously reported has been subject to revision – on Monday, ending what appeared to be a freeze on the bill after the House Ways and Means Committee gave its approval early last month. It now proceeds to the full House for a vote.  If approved, the bill would empower the Arizona Department of Revenue to collect taxes in the form of cryptocurrency – and make the state the first in the U.S. to officially accept a cryptocurrency as payment.  While an old version of the bill named bitcoin, the new version is more ""agnostic"" toward which coins might be accepted and gives more leeway to tax officials, according to Representative Jeff Weninger, one of the proposed law's sponsors. Weninger told CoinDesk earlier this month that the bill's sponsors were working to make it more easily understood by the legislature's other members, but hoped to pass it within weeks.  And though Arizona appears to be moving ahead with its cryptocurrency tax plan, other states haven't been so successful.  Georgia State Senator Mike Williams told CoinDesk earlier this month that the bill he sponsored has stalled due in part to a lack of understanding among lawmakers there.  ""[Passing the bill is] going to take educating decision-makers and government regulators on what cryptocurrencies are,"" Williams said at the time.  Illinois  is also considering a similar tax payments measure. As of April 13, that bill was being considered by the Illinois House of Representative's Rules Committee, public records show.

The firm outlined the policy in an updated code of ethics that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 19. Capital Group's website includes a previous version of the document, which is dated October 2016 and does not include any mention of ICOs.  The updated code of ethics reads:  ""All associates and immediate family members residing in the same household may not participate in IPOs or ICOs.""  It goes on to explain that investing in initial public offerings (IPOs) may be acceptable under certain circumstances, but does not provide exceptions for investing in ICOs.  In a separate section, the document says, ""The following transactions are prohibited: […] Initial Coin Offering (ICO) investments (this prohibition applies to all Capital associates).""  The code of ethics does not indicate whether Capital Group invests or plans to invest in ICOs on behalf of its clients. That said, the prohibition suggests that employees' investing in token sales could create a conflict of interest, though, implying that the firm might consider making such investments. Representatives for the firm didn't respond to requests for comment.  Capital Group offers a range of financial services and products, including dozens of mutual funds through its American Funds subsidiary. Capital Group was the world's ninth-largest asset manager at the end of 2016, according to data from WillisTowersWatson, and the company employs around 7,500 people as outlined on its website.

The company was quick to alert users to the danger, tweeting a warning at 7:29 a.m. EDT, within 15 minutes of when the hack began:    Couple of DNS servers were hijacked to resolve https://t.co/xwxRJ4H4i8 users to be redirected to a phishing site. This is not on @myetherwallet side, we are in the process of verifying which servers to get it resolved asap.        — MyEtherWallet.com (@myetherwallet) April 24, 2018    Even so, users took to social media to report that they were losing funds.  ""Went on to myetherwallet and saw that myetherwallet had [an] invalid connection certificate in the corner,"" rotistain posted to the wallet's subreddit around 8:30 a.m. EDT, adding:  ""As soon as I logged in, there was a countdown for about 10 seconds and A tx was made sending the available money I had on the wallet to another wallet '0x1d50588C0aa11959A5c28831ce3DC5F1D3120d29.' I have no idea what happened.""  Micky Socaci, lead developer at BlockBits.io, explained the attack in a post to the ethereum subreddit.  ""Do not use myetherwallet.com if you're using Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4) at this moment,"" he wrote, adding: ""It seems these DNS servers are resolving the domain to a bad server that CAN steal your keys!""  His explanation fits with MyEtherWallet's assertion that the attack was not on their side. Domain Name System (DNS) servers resolve website URLs to the appropriate IP addresses.  Money on the move  As of press time, the affected funds are being shuffled around and broken into smaller increments, according to data from blockchain information provider Etherscan.  Initially, the Etherscan block explorer showed 0x1d50588C0aa11959A5c28831ce3DC5F1D3120d29 as having received 179 inbound transactions starting from 7:17 a.m. and totaling 216.06 ether, or nearly $152,000 at the time of writing.  The attacker sent 215 ether to another address, 0x68ca85dbf8eba69fb70ecdb78e0895f7cd94da83, at 10:15 a.m. Since then, the funds have been split further, with increments being divided between multiple wallet addresses.  According to MyEtherWallet CEO Kosala Hemachandra, ""all the DNS servers are resolving back to correct addresses.""  ""But I want to wait another [hour] or so,"" he added during a conversation on Skype.  Hemachandra said that the hackers were apparently ""large enough to do a DNS poisoning attack on Google public DNS servers, which made it cache a malicious IP address for myetherwallet.com."" Google fixed the issue ""in a very short time,"" he went on to say.  ""It is really unfortunate, we live in a world where even the most secured websites are prone to this kind of attacks,"" Hemachandra told CoinDesk.

According to an announcement Tuesday, Etherisc was approached by two local ethereum developers to develop a policy that specifically provides hurricane damage cover for the Caribbean island's residents.  The need for the policy arose from the many small businesses and low-income households that were hit by Hurricane Maria and later faced delayed claims and refusals to pay out on policies from traditional insurers, according to the startup.  Hosted on its distributed platform, Etherisc said the new policy will cut premium costs by eliminating the middle-men in the insurance claims process, as well as providing more transparency, with every transaction visible for both insurers and residents.  Making use of embedded smart contracts, the decentralized policy would trigger automated insurance payouts based on predetermined weather parameters, the team said.  Commenting on the upcoming launch, co-founder Stephan Karpischek said:  “The hurricane insurance is the first use case that embodies our belief in what insurance should achieve – helping people solve real problems and manage risks in their communities.”  The new policy marks Etherisc's latest exploration into using blockchain technology to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction within the insurance industry.

42428952,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLnBBh,1524576665,Everything Ex-CFTC Chair Gary Gensler Said About Cryptos Being Securities,"Editor's Note: The following transcript comes from Monday's talk at the MIT Technology Review Business of Blockchain event given by Gary Gensler, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.      Good afternoon, I am going to talk to you about blockchain technology and its real potential. And I believe it does have a real potential in the world of finance.  It’s an innovative way, of course, to verifiably move value or apply code or ""dapps"" as some people call them on a distributed network, but what’s moving value or code on a distributed network, but really finance because it ties to the essential plumbing of the financial sector which at its core moves and allocates money and risk. So, value and code, money and risk.  It seems, in essence, this is the core to the plumbing of the financial sector. To reach its potential though, and for public confidence, blockchain technology has to be compliant with laws.  It doesn't mean the laws have to stay exactly the same, but laws that have been established over many, many decades that customers and investors and to make sure that markets work efficiently, that's called market integrity. So, customer protection, investor protection, market integrity. And to really work I believe blockchain technology needs to come within that public policy framework.  Now this can be done by balancing those protections while at the same time promoting innovation. But as we currently see things, we're not in a pretty good shape right now.  There really is significant non-compliance with respect to the laws, certainly in this country and in many many other countries as well. Many initial coin offerings probably well over a thousand, many crypto exchanges, probably 100 to 200, are basically operating outside of US law.  And when I say outside, that means non-compliance with the laws right now. So, that's a lot of this marketplace right now, now I'm an optimist, I want to see this technology succeed, it is in essence about the plumbing of the financial system and it's a new technology that can really enhance the financial system.  So, I think we need to kind of bring it inside. And there's gonna be a lot of technical and commercial challenges, and you've heard about that during the conference - about scalability, about interoperability, and governance and privacy and the like.  I'm going to just sort of focus on the public policy side, I think ultimately when it does succeed, this innovation has a chance to lower costs, lower risk and yes, in some ways, bore into some of the economic rents of centralized institutions, where they can collect excess and extra rents. The question is then, really, for this new technology, 'How do we go forward?' And it is often said that the devil is in the details.  So initial coin offerings. What do we know? $6.5 billion in the first quarter of 2018. Hasn't slowed down. $6 billion dollars in 2017 which in itself was a 40-fold increase. So maybe this year could we see $25 to $50 billion dollars all year if it keeps ramping up? Is it $20 to $30 billion?  It's no longer a small market, it surpasses a lot of the VC space and other ways of raising money. But there's significant frauds and scams in this market as well.  One of my colleagues Christian [Catalini] thinks upwards to 25 percent. Some outside sources have numbers even well in excess of that as well. But this innovative way of crowd funding offers prefunctional, transferrable tokens for use on a future blockchain application.  And it has mixtures of economic attributes, which is both investment and consumption. So you've heard this debate - is it a utility token, is it a consumable token or is it investment?  Well kind of the answer is it's both. I know that's not an answer that a lot of people like, but that's kind of where we are right now. The fungible nature of the tokens and the expectation of profits distinguish it from a theater ticket or a personal seat license at a sporting event. It's fungible and you're expecting future profits when the network comes together.  The presence of a transferrable usable token and an expectation of profit further distinguishes it from crowd funding on Kickstarter or Gofundme or elsewhere. So, lacking traditional features of equity or bonds, doesn't pay a dividend, you don't necessarily get a coupon, you say 'huh I'm home free.' Not really, not really. Because the investing public is clearly hoping for possible appreciation based on the efforts of promoters and development teams. And so, this brings me to a very important test in the law - it's called the duck test.  Riley  is not familiar to the rest of you maybe, but when you quack like the duck, when you swim like the duck, when you walk like the duck, Riley 100 years ago said, 'I think the bird's a duck.' So, why is that, why am I talking about that at a blockchain conference? Well, in essence, when investing in any form of finance, whether an ICO or traditional forms like stocks and bonds, the public benefits from full and fair disclosure.  The investing public benefits from prohibitions against fraud and manipulation. And so many years ago, in the 1930s, Congress invented in the securities laws a definition of security. But that definition of security includes something other than just stocks and bonds, it also includes something called an investment contract. This is not arcane law, it's been tested over and over again at our supreme court as recently in the last 15 years. But in the 1940s, the key test was something called the Howey Test.  So, what is this all about? Well, there was a man named William Howey and William Howey had orange groves in Florida. You might say why am I talking about orange groves? Well this company sold land and gave the buyers an option to lease the land with an affiliated company – it was not stocks, it was not bonds, but guess what – the Supreme Court said it was an investment contract. And what the Supreme Court said is an investment contract is that what you see up on the screen.  Is it an investment of money, is it a money going to a common enterprise, is it a reasonable expectation of profit relying on the efforts of others. Think of those four-part test, it's all nuanced, it's all facts and circumstances, but always always recall the duck test as well. And so the Supreme Courts also ruled subsequent to that in 2004 that when they're talking about profits, the profits don't have to be dividends. The profits don't have to be some other right of return. The profits include something that you think is about appreciation and that was in the Edwards case.  The SEC ruled on this last summer in The DAO letter and the Munchee Order and this Centra complaint, but more important than that, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has spoken about this. And I quote, this was Chairman Clayton, it's not me, 'I believe ICO I've seen is a security. You can call it a coin, but if the function is a security, it's a security.'  That sure sounds like you can call it a coin, but if it's a duck, it's a duck. But anyway, I tend to agree with the Chairman. I haven't reviewed all the ICOs. Who could review 1,000 to 2,000? But other than maybe CryptoKitties – which I think CryptoKitties is not a security, I'm not sure it's an ICO though – I tend to agree with him.  So, the question now is where do we go? What's next. And I don't think it's any longer question of if, I don't think it's a question of when, ICOs really must comply with securities, commodities and derivatives laws here in the U.S. and frankly around the globe.  And I should even throw in also anti-money laundering and know your customer because the U.S. Treasury Department is written on that as well. And this is not just because one reason - the economics, with $6.5 billion raised, when one firm - Telegram - raises $1.7 billion, what do we call that? That's capital formation. Investors protection, consumer protection is worthy in this space. Yes, it's a utility token, but yes it's an investment contract.  So, the duck test, the economics, the law, the Chairman, the statement all say this is where we're headed. So, let's just talk about what that means. I'm going to go to four general considerations and four specific considerations.  So, four general considerations. Remediation. So, how might regulators bring 1000 past ICOs into compliance? Might be retroactive registration with rescission rights. Some requirements are going to be difficult to sort of put in there. It's not easy to tuck them all in, particularly beneficial ownership. There's been a requirement since the 1930s that you know your shareholders - initially to avoid double spending - just like the blockchain. But more recently to comply with anti money laundering laws. Secondly, how do you recover the losses? Can regulators and the courts help?  Well guess what, private citizens have a right under our securities law to bring their own private rights of action.  Whether it's against ICOs, or exchanges or the like, but the money might not be there. Thirdly, it's compliance with possible tailoring. Again, laws were written at an earlier stage. I stand here on the stage saying investor protection is important... But I'm also saying that I think we might need to tailor some of these rules and regulations so that they fit into this new technology while still protecting investors.  And lastly a regulator talking to you all, the question is what tools in the regulatory tool kit does a regulator use? Is it some enforcement actions, give a few speeches and expect the market to come into compliance? Is it hoping that private citizens will bring private rights of actions? Or is it also in addition using the rule writing authority? And I think you've seen that at the CFTC at the agency I was honored to run, but I think you'll see that at the SEC at some point too.  So now let's talk about some specifics about the ICO market.  So, first what you read a little bit about in The New York Times is, OK, the SEC and regulators around the globe need to look at all these tokens. I think that'll bring clarity to the market. And I think that's not just the ones we call initial coin offerings, but it's really critical to go through the top tokens. And so, we did a little analysis, I've done this analysis, but with the help of some others on just the big five.  Bitcoin, litecoin, bitcoin cash all strikes that they're probably not. As a non-lawyer, I get it. People were starting to tweet, you know, is he a lawyer? But bitcoin and so forth, probably not and why do I say that? Because bitcoin came into existence as mining began as an incentive in validating a distributed platform. No initial token offerings, no pre -mined coins, no kind of common enterprise under that Howey Test. And litecoin and bitcoin were both forks off of that.  But what about ether and ripple? And you can go down. I'm not trying to pull these out, it's just these are the big five. These all seem to have attributes of that Howey Test. Was money given over in 2014 for ether, bitcoin for ether? Was money given to ripple every month they sell another bit of it out of the escrow?  Is there a common enterprise. Ripple labs sure seems like a common enterprise, or the Ethereum Foundation in 2014, I'm talking about. Is it on the expectation of profits, well the Ethereum Foundation offering had an 50 percent appreciation right in the first 42 days written into the offering.  And Ripple even today links to 16 market makers in XRP and they're doing a lot to enhance the value of XRP for the benefit of holders of XRP for the benefit of their own company because they own 60 or 61 percent of XRP. And is it on the efforts of others? Well, in the Ripple case, that feels to be the case, ethereum sort of evolved into something maybe else. But, the Ethereum Foundation is still quite central, maybe not as central as Ripple Labs.  So, I think there's a strong case, but it's not whether I think so. I think there's a worthy public debate about these issues.  The second issue is token design. Is there possibly a design that's really about consumption and not about investment? And sort of solely about consumption not investment? It's gonna be a challenging time because the SEC's already said in the Munchee order that it will take more than semantics, or more than a token being functional. So, this functional, bit is an important bit but not enough.  Third, how should multi-stage contracts happen. Like, when filecoin raised a quarter of a billion dollars in something called a SAFT. And there's a lot of debate.  Can you put a packaging around a token, and so the package is a security and so the token later on is not. Is that alright? The SEC has not yet spoken on that, and there's controversy around it. Let's call that, that's yet to be determined.  And then fourth, is a new concept, can a security token transform to be something else. And a group of venture capitalists went into the SEC ten days ago, they've circulated paperwork to a lot of people and they're sort of saying, 'believe us we get you, we're with the SEC, but we have a bunch of clients that are going to evolve to be a consumable token.' I'm kind of don't think this is going to work. I don't think there's any precedent in the law for a security to transform to be something else. But this is an issue on the table and it's a worthy debate.  So, in conclusion, blockchain technology has a real potential to change the world of finance. It could lower costs, and risks and economic rents but for broad adoption the technology needs to move forward in the public policy sphere. I think basic norms are what's critical. The basic norms of investor protection, and consumer protection and of course making sure illicit activities can't occur. But we also need to adapt some of the rules of the road so that this new technology fits in. But I don't think it means that we just exempt the whole field and say 'good luck investors'.  Not when the money and the dollars are so big. With over 1,000 of these already launched, good chance it's going to be a pretty interesting year in 2018. Market participants have a role, have a very real role with regulators and technologists figuring this all out.  But I do think the public will benefit and ultimately reap the benefits and if anybody's interested I'll be teaching on Tuesdays and Thursdays next fall this course.  Question and Answer:  I want to start with probably the most controversial statement you made, which is, how can you say CryptoKitties are not a security?  I just... there's something about CryptoKitties that is wonderful, but I don't think it's an initial coin offering. It did have a little airdrop, by the way I think airdrops don't get you off the hook. But it started that way, but then you have this unique - I think it's more like a seat license.  That you have a unique asset and you own your kitty rather than like these others. But there's actually a SEC case long ago, actually a court case called the Weaver Beaver Association, so look that one up, that's kind of a neat one.  In fact, the controversial statement that you made obviously was that ethereum and ripple might end up being classed as securities. First of all, there's no reason why you wouldn't have, but do you have a sense of how long it might take the SEC to come to a ruling on stuff like this?  I don't know, I think that this is a multi-year process.  The reason I say that is to write a rule, get public comments, to get feedback, finalize that rule, give a period of time for implementation and maybe court challenge is two years at a minimum and possibly three to five years when you really see how things go. I think 2018 and I'll be speaking more about exchanges later this week, but 2018's a period of time to try to bring compliance into this sort of 1000 plus tokens.  What ripple and ether, while I think there's a strong case particularly for ripple or XRP given the centrality and the common enterprise around Ripple Labs, and that they're selling it every month and so forth. That's really a discussion between them and the SEC and ultimately the way I would think is if the SEC declares that there're securities that might end up in court, and so it won't be the SEC it maybe not even a federal district court but an appellate court, that will decide or the Supremes.  But let me say this, if they decide that they're not securities, I think that too probably ends up in court and the reason is is because somebody else will say, 'well why are they getting out of regulation and I'm not.' So, law is best when applied consistently and we went through the duck test and the Howey Test - a little humorous - but it's also because for whichever way authorities go they have to have an eye on consistency as well.  So, I think nine months at the least, maybe two to five years at the longest.  So let's say at some point the SEC rules that a large number of these things are in fact securities, does that have a chilling effect on the whole blockchain space?  I believe that it's a net positive. So much in our economic life and in our personal lives oscillates so it might have a chilling effect on this frothy ICO market, but I think it's a positive for blockchain.  We have right now major institutions that want to significantly adapt and adopt, asset managers who want to invest in this space, major exchange companies who want to move into this space.  The unregulated exchanges in aggregate - I'm making an estimate here that the unregulated exchanges in aggregate - make more money, more bottom line than the aggregate regulated spaces in the securities field around the globe right now. So they want to get into the space. Right now the incumbents are making less than the startups.  Well, you might say that that's bully good, but the incumbents are doing it in part because they're front running and they're not treating their customers and investors in a way that probably you'd want.  Does it restrict the kinds of things that can be done with tokens? To simplify grossly, we're talking about tokens that are issued on blockchains that are trying to be anonymous, decentralized, distributed. Can something that is anonymous and decentralized also be SEC compliant?  I think it's very challenging.  There's a number of public policy considerations and this is in 180 countries. But tax authorities don't want to lose much of their tax base, and none of use want to really promote illicit activities around money laundering or terrorism financing and the like. E  very nation has signed into if you do an offer you know the beneficial owners. That's not just a US thing that's around the globe. And yet the technologists in this room would probably tell me it's a little tricky on a blockchain to know something more than the public key and Monero and others even find a way to put, shall we say, fog on top of the public keys. So, knowing your customer and beneficial ownership is at the heart of nearly every developed country's securities laws and investor protection laws.  I think that's going to be, that's something that if technologists figure it out, that's going to be a real plus.  Scenario: SEC clamps down on lots of these things, it says a lot of you guys who issued tokens and a lot of you people holding tokens what you were doing was illegal. Well the holder's not necessarily. The public might have been scammed but they weren't necessarily breaking the law.  So two classes of people with two classes of problems. The people who issued the tokens, are they criminals? What happens to them? And then the people holding the tokens, were they scammed and how do they get redress?  I think regulators around the globe will sort it through but as you saw in the first of these last summer, the DAO, the SEC chose to write an order but they didn't actually then have a civil money penalty, they just wrote an order and tried to change behavior.  I think there's a reasonable case to be made that if you can come into compliance, if the securities and exchange commission gives some number of months and I don't know that that's the right period of time, but some number of months or a year or whatever to come into compliance, then they'll look forward. The challenge is compliance is about disclosure, that's hard to do but it's do-able.  Compliance is about the manner of sale. You can't change the manner of sale from two years ago, but maybe you can change the manner of sale going forward. Compliance is about beneficial ownership, that's a tricky one. Compliance is about anti-fraud and insider trading rules.  So, I think it's more like let's look forward and there's a thousand plus horses running out on the field that got out of the barn and we've gotta kind of bring them into compliance. And even for Ripple and ether, or maybe it's EOS or NEO or.. but for the big market cap ones, there needs to be clarity in the market and if the clarity in the market is that they're not securities they might still be commodities, they might still need to comply with all of those laws, but I think it's a period of time, but if you do an issuance now in April of 2018 do it under the US securities laws.  I think everybody's on notice now. And Chairman Clayton did that in February pretty clearly, and any law firm advising them I'm sure is telling them we can't write you an opinion unless you comply with one of the exemptions. There are various exemptions if you only sell to accredited investors or other various ways to package these things. They'd still have some burden, they still have costs and this kind of tricky question of how you figure out who all your beneficial owners are.  Exemptions and selling to accredited investors - the SAFT - which you mentioned do you think that that resolves the problem?  Well I think you're asking two questions. The first is do I think selling to accredited investors under what's called Regulation D works. Yes, if you comply with all the exemptions and all the requirements of Reg D. Do I think that a SAFT or a multi-staged where you can one day be a security and a year or two later no be, or in essence, filecoin's token, not to pick on them but it's a real case, will filecoin's token not have to be registered?  I think that's unlikely but they might be successful. That's between them and the securities lawyers at the SEC. I think that at the core is the economics. The core is you can be both a consumable token and an investment token and then you need to comply with securities laws. And if somebody's raising a quarter of a billion dollars as filecoin did or $1.7 billion as Telegram did, and the market is the size that the market is, there's a lot of investors who are investing and then I think the laws should adapt.  There's going to be a lot of changes over that over the next two to five years are appropriate. But it's better to bring it inside of the public policy framework even if there's a bit of a chill. But to bring it in, to be stronger and reap the benefits later. And I think the internet went through this a bit and other technologies, railroads went through it in the 19th century.  New technologies usually come about outside of a public policy framework and at some point whether it's a taxing authorities or other authorities, but we still want to achieve something. In this world we want to protect investors and consumers, we don't want like consumers money to be lost like a half a billion dollars got lost at Coincheck in Japan in January.  I mean we all remember Mt. Gox about four or five years ago. This keeps happening.  So there's still core public policy goals, and they're still worthy and sort of adapting the technology and adapting the laws to fit them together.

Take CoinDesk's State of Blockchain Survey,"After a historic 2017, the cryptocurrency markets took a decided downturn in Q1.  Bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin – and most major cryptocurrencies – saw declines in a variety of metrics: exchange volumes, transaction counts, and, of course, price. With it, too, public sentiment on the technology appears to have become more mixed.  Some naysayers, like Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, saw the decline as confirmation that 2017 was a mirage and that bitcoin ""ought to be outlawed,"" while Warren Buffett joined the chorus as prices started to tank and stated that it would “all come to a bad ending.""  Still others, like Twitter & Square CEO Jack Dorsey, ignored lowered prices to suggest ""the world ultimately will have a single currency…[and] that it will be bitcoin."" Peter Thiel made similar comments, while Goldman Sachs issued a report that stressed bitcoin’s usefulness as a crisis currency.  Besides the prices, there was more bad news: Coincheck experienced a huge hack of $400 million, while regulators everywhere from South Korea to the U.S. took pointed aim at the industry. Several banks even went so far as to ban crypto purchases with credit cards, and the most heavily trafficked websites in the world (Twitter, Facebook and Google) all banned crypto-related ads.  While these events all spoke to dimmed prospects for the industry, there were other positive signs: the launch of the Lightning Network, the historic Telegram ICO that raised $1.7 billion and Rakuten (the Amazon of Japan) announcing plans to migrate its entire $9 billion loyalty program over to a cryptocurrency.

42428935,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLnAnh,1524571214,War On Miners? Maybe Not On This $2 Billion Blockchain,"One of the world's largest cryptocurrencies could soon put out a welcome mat for more controversial miners – that is, if one of its core developers has his way.  Indeed, amidst what has been broadly called a ""war on miners,"" with cryptocurrencies including ethereum, monero and siacoin taking aggressive steps to limit the effectiveness of certain types of hardware, developer Cody Burns has published a proposal that would alter ethereum classic's underlying algorithm to accommodate the technology.  If accepted, the change would make ethereum classic something of an anomaly among major cryptocurrencies, whose communities have largely viewed the powerful mining machines in question – application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) – as a threat to maintaining an open competition for the rewards on their respective blockchains.  But if there's a general fear over how ASICs could upset the balance of major cryptocurrencies, it's not without good reason. In the minds of many crypto enthusiasts, the concerns aren't just speculation, they're an inevitability based on historical data.  Case in point is the bitcoin blockchain, which saw less expensive, and less effective, graphic card mining eclipsed by not just ASICs, but by a few large companies that came to dominate their creation, marketing and delivery.  As such, the argument among many developers is that the release of ASICs is so problematic, it's worth updating the software just to avoid them. (Monero's developers, for example, went so far as to ask all software users to install new code earlier this month that would resist ASIC mining.)  But Burns sees another way, finding issue with a prevailing view he believes has turned the successful companies that today secure and process cryptocurrency transactions into boogeymen.  Burns told CoinDesk:  “The chief complaint I hear most often is not that ASICs are themselves bad, it is that Bitmain is the sole source of the ASICs.""  And, he believes, the only way to increase competition in the ASIC manufacturing space and keep centralization at bay is by allowing ASICs to run rampant.  As such, his proposal, ECIP-1043, looks to remove a mechanism by which ethereum classic's algorithm creates random variances in its memory storage requirements, code originally put in place to reduce the effectiveness of ASICs.  Good for GPUs too  But if that sounds controversial, Burns thinks it's still possible to win support for the idea.  For one, not only will the change allow for ASICs to mine ethereum classic, but as it decreases the need for extra computer storage, it should also lower the cost of GPU mining – something likely to win over existing miners who are reluctant to pay for new and improved hardware.  To do this, Burns wants to delete ethereum classic's so-called ""DAG"" function.  One of the aspects that ethereum classic still shares with its rival ethereum is that every 100 hours – or what's called an ""epoch"" – the DAG adds random data to the blockchain, which in turn causes the storage requirement for mining chips to grow.  In order to mine ether or ether classic, then, mining hardware must contain sufficient memory, or RAM, to store this graph, as well as backup storage, as the memory requirement increases.  “The thinking behind it was, it is costly to add RAM to an ASIC so we will keep the RAM requirement a moving target,” Burns told CoinDesk. “Anyone developing an ASIC will be creating equipment that will become obsolete very quickly.”  In this way, the DAG on ethereum and ethereum classic has grown from 1 GB to 2.5 GB, which according to Burns, has become a burden on GPU miners as well. And because of the way the DAG is programmed, this burden will only get worse as time goes on.  With the DAG and the memory requirements of the blockchain itself, GPU miners need about 4 GB of memory in order to cope with the data set.  Burns told CoinDesk:  “That is a huge overhead in cost for a card that may or may not last one year.""  While ethereum has always seen miners as a ""necessary evil that will be chopped off if possible,"" he continued, ethereum classic has allowed miners an opportunity to comment on design choices, since they are viewed as a long-term security measure.  As such, setting up an architecture that might harm miners – like blocking ASICs or keeping the DAG requirement – is considered a bad thing in ethereum classic developers' eyes.  ASIC risks  But convincing all ethereum classic users to go along with the proposal might not be so easy.  For one, the ethereum classic community, which kept operating an early iteration of the ethereum code abandoned by its original developers, has been steadfast about its driving mantra: ""code is law."" As such, it's questionable whether those transacting over the software would want to change that law now.  Further, the move, if accepted, won't come without its risks. As it would require a system-wide upgrade, or hard fork, in order to activate, it would need to have unanimous support from the mining community to prevent a split.  Furthermore, because resetting the DAG would encourage ASIC development, there are concerns that the more efficient hardware could overtake the network and make GPU mining obsolete.  Yet, Burns said that, in the long-term, because ASICs are more efficient than GPUs, it might be the better choice for the proof-of-work blockchain.  “If proof-of-work is the long-term goal of ethereum classic, systems need more energy-efficient mining equipment. ASICs are the long-term answer to that need,” he told CoinDesk.  Burns summed up the situation, saying:  “It is less a case of being ASIC resistant as being ASIC competitive.”  Mining equipment image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/24/war-on-miners-maybe-not-on-this-2-billion-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab352fd8b458df0a1ae4724083072f36f3c5ca3a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428956,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLnBHh,1524567654,Bitcoin Is Facing Stiff Resistance On Road to $10K,"Bitcoin is solidly bid on Tuesday and could test the $10,000 mark in the next few days, chart analysis suggests.  Following a sharp price spike just after midnight (UTC), the cryptocurrency rose to $9,308 on Bitfinex – the highest level since March 14. At time of writing, BTC was trading at $9,291, up 4.2 percent over the last 24 hours.  As suggested by the convincing move above the long-term descending trendline and bullish daily relative strength index, the bulls look to be firmly in control.  However, on the way to $10,000, stiff resistance lies in wait around $9,280 and $9,800, as seen on the chart below.  Daily chart  Currently, BTC is trading very close to the resistance at $9,278 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from the Dec. 17 high to Feb. 6 low). Further, $9,280 marks the neckline of the bearish double-top pattern seen in the first quarter.  A notch higher, the 200-day moving average hurdle is lined up $9,808, while the March 12 high and Jan 23 low of $9,900 may also prove to be obstacles to the bulls.  Elsewhere, both the 60-minute and 4-hour relative strength indexes (RSIs) show overbought conditions, so an argument could be made that a rally to $10,000 won't be smooth sailing.  However, a bullish continuation pattern can be seen on the 4-hour chart below, indicating scope for a rally to $10,250.  4-hour chart  The bull pennant breakout indicates a resumption of the rally from the April 17 low of $7,823 and has opened the doors for $10,250 (pole height added to breakout price).  The presence of a strong bullish setup will likely overshadow the overbought conditions as shown by the 4-hour RSI (above 70.00) and we will likely see a rally to $10,000 or more.  View  BTC will likely cross the resistance around $9,280 in a convincing manner and test the 200-day moving average of $9,808 in the short-run. Acceptance above the long-term moving average would further strengthen the bull grip. In such a case, BTC may rise to $10,300 (bull pennant breakout target).  Rejection at $9,280, despite the bull pennant breakout, followed by a drop below 8,930 could yield a pullback to $8,550 (ascending 10-day MA).  Overall, the outlook remains bullish as long as BTC trades above the long-term descending trendline.

42428957,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLnBDh,1524560435,'Enough Is Enough': Finance Guru Sues Facebook Over Crypto Scams,"Martin Lewis, a British personal finance guru, is suing Facebook for allowing scammers, including some promoting cryptocurrency schemes, to use his likeness in advertisements on the platform.  Lewis is the founder of the MoneySavingExpert blog, and his name and face well known following his years of writing and many TV appearances. In a post to his blog Monday, Lewis explained that he is initiating high court proceedings against Facebook over the issue in a personal capacity, not through MoneySavingExpert. Any damages the court might award him would be donated to anti-scam charities, the post adds.  According to Lewis, over 50 fake ads using his likeness have been published on Facebook within the past year. He names two scams in particular, Bitcoin Code and Cloud Trader – both of which promised outsized profits from trading binary options, a risky asset class that Lewis calls a ""near-certain money-loser.""  The Facebook ads in some cases link to fake news articles designed to resemble U.K. news sources The Mirror and the BBC.  ""Enough is enough,"" Lewis writes. ""I've been fighting for over a year to stop Facebook letting scammers use my name and face to rip off vulnerable people – yet it continues.""  He states:  ""It's time Facebook was made to take responsibility. It claims to be a platform not a publisher – yet this isn't just a post on a web forum, it is being paid to publish, promulgate and promote what are often fraudulent enterprises. My hope is this lawsuit will force it to change its system.""  Facebook announced that it would ban ads for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) in January.  Reached for comment Monday, a Facebook spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis that he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed. We are in direct contact with his team, offering to help and promptly investigating their requests, and only last week confirmed that several adverts and accounts that violated our Advertising Policies had been taken down.""  Lewis acknowledges that Facebook has removed some of the ads, but says it has taken ""days or weeks"" in some cases, and that the scammers respond by re-posting ads that are all-but identical.

The firm recently surveyed more than 400 clients on its data and trading platforms, including Eikon, REDI, FXall and Elektron. About 20 percent of these clients were ""really interested and actively exploring"" launching cryptocurrency trading operations in 2018, the firm's director of new content initiatives Sam Chadwick told CoinDesk.  Chadwick added:  ""The feedback really astonished us a bit.""  According to a press statement, 70 percent of the firms looking into trading plan to begin in three to six months, while another 22 percent aim to start in six to 12 months.  ""This is a major change from a year ago,"" Neill Penney, Thomson Reuters' co-head of trading, said in the statement.  Chadwick emphasized the shift in attitudes, telling CoinDesk that a year ago, ""as we were engaging customers, none of them had any particular interest in cryptocurrencies."" Clients were instead interested in ""the blockchain side of things, smart contracts.""  Interest has since notably shifted towards cryptocurrencies. For example, within Eikon's foreign exchange category, traffic to the landing page for cryptocurrencies comes second only to the euro, Chadwick said. Thomson Reuters has also supplemented its bitcoin price feed with data for ether, litecoin, bitcoin cash and Ripple's XRP, as well as bitcoin futures prices and indices from CryptoCompare.  Chadwick says that this rapid expansion beyond bitcoin brings up ""the interesting question about altcoins, and how diverse do we go here?""  Some survey respondents said, ""we'll trade anything,"" he continued. However, in general, interest concentrated around those coins with larger market valuations. A small number further expressed interest in trading ICO tokens, but ""privacy coins"" such as zcash and monero had few takers. And a few said they were amenable to trading cryptocurrencies, but only through ETFs or similar instruments.  Chadwick would not name the clients that had expressed interest in cryptocurrency trading, but he said they included large asset managers, hedge funds and ""some of the trading desks at some of the largest banks.""  Speculating as to why financial institutions are suddenly interested in cryptocurrency trading, Chadwick said there was ""obviously"" some correlation with cryptocurrencies' prices. He added, though, that traditional financial players might be interested in gaining experience with tokenized assets in general, since they anticipate a wave of new instruments such as crypto bonds, blockchain-based equity and tokenized dividends.  ""We could start seeing some really, really clever stuff,"" he said, adding:  ""If these organizations have no competence to trade crypto assets at all, they'll be locked out of a broad segment.""

According to the Japanese news outlet Asahi Shimbun Tuesday, 16 exchanges that are currently registered with Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) have formally launched a new self-regulatory organization dubbed the Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Association.  Taizen Okuyama, president and CEO of Money Partners, a publicly traded foreign exchange firm that has also entered the cryptocurrency space, is to serve as chairman of the group.  Alongside 15 other participants, including bitFlyer, SBI Virtual Currency and GMO Coin, Okuyama announced the formal launch during the group's first meeting on Monday, the report says.  By uniting all licensed exchanges in the country, the association said it will make efforts to develop comprehensive rules regarding customer protection and internal controls, and will seek compliance from member companies. In addition, penalties will be imposed by the group to punish activities that undermine the integrity of the industry, the report indicates.  ""I will make sure that security measures and internal control are in place,"" Okuyama was quoted as saying. ""We want to eliminate customers' concerns and work to restore public confidence in order to develop a healthy market.""  The news comes as exchanges in Japan more widely are taking steps to restore public confidence in the industry following a hack in January that exploited some $500 million-worth of NEM tokens from the Coincheck exchange.  The planned to found the group was first announced in March as a response to the FSA's increasing regulatory activities, including on-site inspections to gauge exchanges' security measures.  Speaking of the current situation where over a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan still operate without a full license from the FSA, Okuyama said the new group will also aim to offer help and advice on the development of these entities.

In a newly published letter to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) dated April 17, CBOE Future Exchange (CFE) managing director Matthew McFarland announced a proposed rule amendment that would lower the minimum increment on its futures contracts from 10 points (worth $10) to 5 points (worth $5) sometime on or after May 1.  The move will have a ""positive impact on the market in XBT futures,"" McFarland wrote.  The change would apply to single leg transactions, meaning those involving only one contract, and not spread trades, which require an investor to buy and sell two different contracts simultaneously. Spread trades currently have a minimum increment of 0.01 points ($0.01), according to the letter.  McFarland said the decision to make this change was supported by data the company collected since its futures contracts launched in December. He went on to write that ""CFE intends to continue to evaluate its experience with the trading in XBT futures and may determine to make future changes relating to XBT futures in light of that experience.""  McFarland continued:  ""CFE believes that the impact of the amendment will be beneficial to the public and market participants.""  Such comments coincide with the more positive outlook taken by the company's leadership in public dialogue on its cryptocurrency products. For example, last month, a senior executive for CBOE Global Markets argued that the market would support a bitcoin-based exchange traded fund (ETF) in a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  And while the company did not explicitly push for approval of an ETF, it did use data to bolster the argument that the market at-large could support such a move.

42428921,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLl5Xh,1524537047,Fear and HODLing at MIT: Blockchain Experts Weigh Impact of SEC Action,"Regulation: It’s good for you, but it’s going to hurt.  That seemed to be the main takeaway for the cryptocurrency industry from Monday’s Business of Blockchain conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  On the one hand, the event was clouded by speculation that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may go as far as to classify two of the top three coins by market cap, ethereum and Ripple’s XRP, as securities. Such a determination could subject a wide swath of industry members to legal penalties – far beyond the promoters of recent initial coin offerings (ICOs) who were already on alert the last few months.  Those fears were reinforced late in the day when Gary Gensler, an old lion of financial services regulation, confirmed for the crowd that in his view, bitcoin’s two largest rivals may fit the description of securities in U.S. law.  ""Ripple Labs sure seems like a common enterprise, or the Ethereum Foundation in 2014,” said Gensler, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “Ripple is doing a lot to advance the value of XRP.""  (The so-called Howey test says something is a security under U.S. law if it is an investment in a ""common enterprise"" offering an expectation of profits from the efforts of others.)  Yet, on the other hand, the general sentiment at the event was optimistic about regulators’ growing involvement in the space.  Neha Narula, director of the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT Media Lab, for example, told CoinDesk insufficient regulation can actually stifle innovation by deterring honest players because rampant scammers undermine market integrity.  And aligning with Gensler, Narula said, there need to be more honest conversations about the fact that many emerging cryptocurrencies are actually securities.  However, there may not be a bright line separating the two.  As Narula said:  “We’re realizing money versus equity isn’t a binary choice. It’s a spectrum.”  Coming pain  And that realization could have a serious impact on the cryptocurrency industry.  Patrick Murck, counsel at Cooley LLP and fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, told CoinDesk the token economy could be on the verge of a dramatic shift if the SEC agrees with Gensler.  If ether and XRP are deemed securities, cryptocurrency exchanges and general industry promoters or foundations, or anyone who sold or evangelized projects like ethereum to the general public, could be subject to legal penalties.  “It would be like shooting fish in a barrel,” Murck said, adding:  “There’s nothing magical about the blockchain that absolves you from investor protection regulations if investors have to trust you to deliver something.”  Driving that point home, Gensler in his talk cited several reasons that the way ethereum and XRP were issued and traded seemed to meet the definition of securities.  For example, the 2014 ethereum crowdsale would have created an expectation of profit for the people who purchased tokens before the network went live.  “The Ethereum Foundation offering had a 50 percent appreciation right in the first 42 days written into the offering,” Gensler said on stage. (The industry think tank Coin Center in Washington, D.C. promptly issued a statement that “ether is not a security,” rebutting Gensler’s argument.)  Meanwhile, for issuers of new tokens, it’s almost impossible to walk the line, even with more feedback from regulators and lawyers.  For example, so-called airdrops, once viewed as a way to avoid breaking securities laws by simply sending free tokens to people who already have some type of cryptocurrency wallet, are instead creating a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t situation.  If issuers fail to collect information about recipients of airdrops, they may inadvertently violate international sanctions (what if that wallet belongs to someone in Iran?). On the other hand, if they do collect such information, the airdrop may start to look like an investment in regulators’ eyes, according to Murck.  “The SEC has interpreted the first prong of the Howey Test broadly,” Murck told CoinDesk. “The collection of information may be enough to fit the first prong” – pegging an airdrop as “an investment of money.”  Long-term gain?  Even so, Murck joined others at the conference in welcoming regulators’ participation in the space.  “They’re becoming a part of our blockchain community and that’s a valuable thing,” Murck said.  Part of the value is clearing up uncertainty.  The shortage of such clarity was illustrated during a talk by Kathleen Breitman, a co-founder of the Tezos project.  When asked whether securities regulations apply to her project’s tokens, Tezzies, she responded:  “I don’t know. I don’t mean to play coy, I’m not just an attorney...I would recommend token holders comply with relevant laws.”  But Gensler said legal clarity is slowly emerging in this red-hot market.  “If you do an issuance now, in April 2018, do it under U.S. securities laws,” said Gensler, who is now a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, “It’s better to bring it into a public policy framework, even if there’s a little bit of a chill.”  And perhaps some cooling off would be healthy. MIT’s Narula said she is deeply concerned about the lack of due diligence completed for many, if not most, cryptocurrency projects. Just because the code is open source doesn’t mean that knowledgeable people have evaluated it.  “A lot of investors don’t know that. They go by signaling,” Narula said. “A lot of projects have had some pretty fundamental flaws that were exposed only after a project launched.”  If nothing else, the excited chatter in the halls of MIT suggested that regulatory encroachment has yet to put a damper on the energy being channeled into blockchain tech.  Amber Baldet, the former JPMorgan Chase blockchain expert, said what makes her optimistic about the space, writ large, isn’t skyrocketing coin prices or even regulatory clarity on the horizon. It’s the explosive growth of this community in the wake of the 2017 boom.  “In order to have an internet of value, people are going to have to interact with each other,” Baldet said, speaking to the need for an ecosystem that includes everyone from enterprises like her former employer to accredited investors to retail investors.  She concluded:  “You meet thousands of people tackling these challenges in unique ways.”  Image via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/24/fear-and-hodling-at-mit-blockchain-experts-weigh-impact-of-sec-action,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ec0ff9477e775af32511742f139adba6c9fe4c1-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428913,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLl5Lh,1524531613,Another Police Official Arrested In Alleged Bitcoin Extortion Plot,"Yet another high-ranking police official in the Indian state of Gujurat has been taken into custody in connection with a $1 million bitcoin extortion scheme.  According to the Hindustan Times, Amreli police superintendent Jagdish Patel was arrested Sunday on suspicion that he helped a group of police officers detain a local resident after which he was forced to give up his bitcoin. Police inspector Anant Patel, who is also based in Amreli, was similarly arrested last week and will be questioned at the same time as Jagdish Patel.  As previously reported, Anant Patel was one of 10 police officers accused of kidnapping, attempted extortion and corruption after businessman Shailash Bhatt, who alleges he was abducted, beaten and forced to turn over 200 bitcoins – an amount worth roughly $1.7 million at press time prices.  Two other locals were also allegedly abducted during the scheme, as alleged by the state's Crime Investigation Department, which launched an investigation earlier this month following the complaints.  Anant Patel was previously thought to be the highest-ranking official related to the case, with the nine other suspects serving as constables.  But while arrests have been made, police director-general Ashish Bhatia said officials have not yet verified that the 200 bitcoins were ever transferred from Bhatt to Anant Patel.  The Hindustan Times also reported that Nalin Kotadia, a former elected official, has also been detained as a potential accomplice of the alleged scheme. It is unclear what role he may have played in the original abduction.
