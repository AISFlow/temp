""Increasingly strict"" regulations hampered the P2P bitcoin exchange's ability to ""provide services to Venezuelans,"" according to a video tweeted by Paxful Monday.  A company spokeswoman confirmed the exit with CoinDesk. ""Concerns regarding the regulatory landscape around Venezuela and Paxful's own risk tolerance"" prompted the exit, she said.  New Venezuelan account creation will be disabled and existing users will have 30 days to withdraw, according to an exit plan shared with CoinDesk.  The departure will deprive Venezuela's underground crypto scene of its second-largest P2P outlet. Venezuela's crypto traders heavily favor P2P crypto exchanges like Paxful and market leader LocalBitcoins over government-approved alternatives.  It also denies Paxful an emerging market it courted for years as the future of bitcoin adoption. Venezuela's rampant inflation, unbanked population and high mobile phone usage have long appealed to company CEO Ray Youssef.  But those attractions weren't enough to overcome the myriad difficulties of operating in an economy as sanctioned and scrutinized as Venezuela's.  In addition to Venezuela's internal cryptocurrency regulator SUNACRIP, the country's international exchanges also face potential troubles from financial sanctions levied by the U.S.  Paxful blamed U.S. sanctions when it shut off trades involving the Bank of Venezuela in June.  It was not immediately clear whether the regulatory uncertainty cited by Paxful was internal or external, perhaps due to U.S. sanctions.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,669 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 3.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,250-$10,759  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin hit as high as $10,759 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase Monday. That level has not been seen since Sept. 3 and the cryptocurrency is now heading into bullish territory.      “The trend is indeed higher,” said Darius Sit, managing partner of quant firm QCP Capital.

A total of $19 million buy liquidations were more than double the $9.1 million in sell liquidations over the weekend and into Monday on BitMEX, helping fuel the price upswing.      In the options market, some traders remained highly bullish that bitcoin can hit new highs.      “While bitcoin price dabbles around $10,000 now, traders have still priced in a chance that bitcoin will trade at $20,000 by March 2021,” said William Purdy, an options trader and founder of analysis firm PurdyAlerts.      Indeed, based on how options are currently trading in the market, it appears as if options traders are estimating a 10% chance that bitcoin will be at $20,000 by the March 2021 expiration date.

42432660,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0fth,1600111554,RGB Continues Its Work to Bring Better Smart Contracts to Bitcoin,"The Takeaway    Under development by the LNP/BP Standards Association, the RGB protocol entered beta in June.  The second layer network promises to bring smart contracts and tokenized assets to Bitcoin with a Lightning Network-esque technical design.  RGB could be used to issue tokenize securities and nonfungible tokens (NFT), and to offer a more private means of stablecoin issuance and transfer.    Smart contracts and Bitcoin. These technical phenomena are rarely associated with each other, often because people believe Bitcoin’s paired-down scripting language can’t support the smart contract applications that have become the darlings of the Ethereum ecosystem.      But as the new smart contract-enabling protocol RGB launches its beta, the folks at the LNP/BP Standards Association are trying to change this perception.      The group (whose acronym is short for Lightning Network Protocol and Bitcoin Protocol) is building RGB, a smart contract network built on top of Bitcoin. (The protocol is named after the “RGB” additive coloring scheme because it originally started as a project to improve Bitcoin’s colored coins scheme for tokenized assets.)      The “third layer” network, as one of its architects, Giacomo Zucco, calls it, has entered beta and could help outfit Bitcoin with the tokenizing capabilities that have made Ethereum the go-to blockchain for issuing tokenized assets like securities, collectibles, crypto dollars and more.      Read more: A Protocol for Issuing Tokens Launches on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network    The new old thing    RGB was first conceptualized by Bitcoin Core developer and cryptography consultant Peter Todd. With undisclosed funding from Bitfinex/Tether, Fulgur Ventures and Poseidon Group, the protocol entered beta testing at the end of June. LNP/BP head Giacomo Zucco clarified that the “RGB node for the software itself is in beta” but that all RGB-compatible wallets are still in alpha.      The pursuit of Bitcoin-based smart contracts – and more generally, tokenizing assets on Bitcoin – is nothing new.      Read more: Writing Bitcoin Smart Contracts Is About to Get Easier With New Coding Language      Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN function has allowed for limited smart contract functionality since the coin’s inception. This function set the technical groundwork for Bitcoin-based NFTs/collectibles through the Counterparty protocol, as well as the issuance of the tether (USDT) stablecoin on Bitcoin through the Omni protocol.      For its own part, the Lightning Network’s hash time-lock contracts – the technical parameters that lock bitcoin (BTC) into payment channels on the secondary network – are a form of smart contract.    Leveraging techniques (and trade-offs) of Lightning    So-called “sidechains” are trusted blockchains in the sense that a federated body of representatives run the nodes that oversee the sidechain’s operations, such as issuing assets and “pegging” bitcoin into the sidechain. These networks, running parallel to a decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin, market smart-contract functions as one of their primary use cases.      RGB, on the other hand, is not a trusted blockchain like RSK or Liquid, nor does it rely on Bitcoin’s main chain to execute transactions like Omni or Counterparty. Instead, its design is taken in the image of its technical cousin, the Lightning Network.      Read more: What Is Bitcoin’s Lightning Network?      The Lightning Network relies on “client-side verification” for its peers to verify the movement of funds. When you send funds to a peer on Lightning, the “state” of the payment channel with this peer is updated on both your Lightning node and your peer’s Lightning node. The final state of the payment channel is not recorded on Bitcoin’s blockchain until the channel is closed.      This delayed verification allows the Lightning Network to process near-instantaneous payments, but this comes at a cost: You must keep your node running at all times or the peer on the other end of your payment channel may try to cheat you by broadcasting a false channel state to the blockchain (a technical service known as Watchtowers are working to mitigate this attack vector).      Zucco said RGB “leverages the techniques and trade-offs of Lightning,” in that assets will be transferred in the same way.      “The RGB design is a client-side validation design. It means that when I send you something, I don’t publish the transfer on the network; I send it to you, peer-to-peer, and I will just use the public network to prevent double-spending. You should use the blockchain only to prevent double-spending, but not for transferring assets.”      He emphasized that the trade-offs are the same as in Lightning and stressed that each RGB node will need to keep backup data of its entire state.      To issue assets on RGB, the issuer creates a “schema” for the asset that defines parameters like fungibility, circulating supply and inflation rate, among others. The asset and its schema are then anchored to a reference point on Bitcoin’s blockchain, such as a UTXO or an address, to index the token and its schema.    RGB use cases    The long-term goal is to make RGB compatible with Lightning, but seeing as the project is still in beta this integration will be some time in the making before it is user-ready.      Until that integration happens, one concrete and logical use case for RGB on its own is for NFTs (although Zucco personally doesn’t find this too exciting). NFTs are unique tokens that typically represent a digital collectible such as a piece of art.      Read more: Money Reimagined: Bitcoin and Ethereum Are a DeFi Double Act      The classic example is CryptoKitties, those breedable NFT felines minted on the Ethereum network. Another perhaps less-familiar example comes from the RarePepe cards issued on Bitcoin using the Counterparty protocol.      RGB could have a leg up on these forms of NFTs because RGB would allow you to send the computer file for the NFT in the same transaction as the asset that represents it. When you send a CryptoKitty as an ERC-721 token on Ethereum or a RarePepe “colored coin” on Bitcoin, the file for the actual collectible has to be transferred separately. With RGB, both asset and collectible can be “sent inside the same channel,” Zucco claimed.      A more salient use case for RGB, according to Zucco, would come from issuing tether on the protocol. Since all transactions are handled off-chain, Zucco said RGB carries with it the promise to be possibly more private than even the Lightning Network.      For something like the stablecoin tether, whose on-chain address on blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS and Tron can be easily tracked and, in extreme scenarios, blacklisted, this could bolster tether’s privacy and censorship resistance.      Read more: High Ethereum Fees Push Tether to Its Eighth Blockchain, OMG Network      “RGB is very private. I cannot follow an RGB asset on the blockchain. Only when you receive an asset do you see the history of the asset, but it’s obfuscated cryptographically with Confidential Transactions technology we reused from Blockstream. Once you send an asset, you won’t be able to see where it goes afterwards,” Zucco told CoinDesk.    Battle-testing RGB in beta    Of course, before these use cases can be realized, RGB needs some battle testing in beta. And there’s still Lightning Network integration and wallet design to consider, as well.      The LNP/BP Standards Association won’t be designing a wallet itself, Zucco said, but will work with third-party developers that do.      After all, LNP/BP will have itd hands full hardening the RGB backbone: its source code. As for the protocol’s appendages – its wallets and other integrations – this development will be up to Bitcoin’s distributed community to bring to life.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING | USDT,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/14/rgb-continues-its-work-to-bring-better-smart-contracts-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a32cbd6f99cb4eb6e260622cfb7a9e4d8123ee45-1307x925.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432665,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0g1h,1600110036,New Index From DeFi Pulse and Set Protocol Offers Easy Access to 10 DeFi Tokens in 1,"Data company DeFi Pulse and investment-minded Set Protocol have created a permissionless index of the very best DeFi tokens, called the DeFiPulse Index.      DeFi Pulse has become the key source of information for assessing which projects are leading and which ones are rising, judged by the total amount of crypto staked on each one, which the company calls Total Value Locked (TVL).      ""We want a way that people can get exposure to DeFi without having to go and buy every token individually, because that costs a lot of gas,"" Scott Lewis of DeFi Pulse told CoinDesk in a phone call.      Ethereum users can now get exposure to a curated set of DeFi projects by buying one token, called DPI, available now on Uniswap: No staking, rebasing, swapping or composing required. It will also be available on Set's TokenSets, through Zapper, Argent, Dharma and others.      Read more: Why DeFi Pulse’s Key Metric Is So Simple It’s Confusing      While there have been questions about the underlying value in the DeFi market, Lewis pushed back.      ""Decentralized finance is infrastructure to enable human coordination. Traditional finance is also infrastructure to incentivize human coordination, and when humans work together it produces value,"" Lewis said. ""It's still early. We still have to figure out if that's an experiment that works.""    DeFiPulse Index    The index will have 10 DeFi tokens: LEND, YFI, COMP, SNX, MKR, REN, KNC, LRC, BAL and REP. That order is arranged from the largest portion of the index (LEND at 18.3%) to the smallest (REP at 1.63%).      ""It's like a [market] cap-weighted index,"" Lewis explained, which he described as ""analogous to how the S&P 500 is weighted.""      The team has an extensive list of criteria for tokens included on the list, including always limiting it to Ethereum, eschewing synthetics, options, wrapped tokens and tokens that stand in for real-world assets. Tokens need to have some respectable time in the markets and of course they have to be listed on DeFi Pulse.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Set CEO Felix Feng emphasized that while there are some synthetic options that represent the same exposure, DeFiPulse Index will represent real assets. That means a user could take the DPI token to Set and redeem it for the actual underlying assets.      The index will be rebalanced from time to time, though probably at the beginning more frequently than the quarterly rebalancing more typical indexes use. It will depend on market conditions, both Set and DeFi Pulse noted, with the goal of moving to quarterly shifts eventually.      The initial token is targeting a price of roughly $100 each, though like all crypto it will be divisible so users should be able to buy in at any amount they like.      Not only is DeFi complicated, but as its popularity grows a lot of untrustworthy projects have arisen. A part of the purpose of the DeFiPulse Index is to let buyers know the coins represent vetted projects.      Read more: What Is Yearn Finance? The DeFi Gateway Everyone Is Talking About      ""DeFi Pulse makes its reputation from separating authentic projects from inauthentic projects,"" Lewis said. ""We've talked to enough teams all over DeFi to sense which ones are really trying to build quality projects.""      For most users, DeFiPulse Index will be accessible by purchasing on exchanges like Uniswap, though for larger traders and desks they can also mint the token directly through Set Protocol, by depositing the underlying assets directly.      ""I think one of the things that's really exciting about the DeFiPulse Index is we think it's going to be a pretty key asset in the entire industry. We anticipate that this asset will be used for yield farming,"" Feng said.    Set v2    ""The crypto market's changed a lot. The kinds of strategies that people are interested in change depending on the market,"" Feng said.      The DeFiPulse Index is the first product coming out of Set Protocol v2.0. Over the period of ""crypto winter,"" Feng explained, Set focused on two-token sets that gained value through programmatic trades based on technical analysis. It's what the company had to do, but enabling indexes was always what Set wanted to build the most.      Read more: Set Protocol Launches Ethereum Trading Strategy Bots      This index represents the first offering from v2, Feng explained. Later on, the firm will debut indices that can incorporate the more complicated features of DeFi, such as derivatives.      Tokens with unusual behaviors, such as AMPL's rebasing mechanism, would not work for the current stage of v2, but that's coming. Set will be rolling out updates over the coming year.      Within the current DPI array, there are tokens like YFI that earn a small amount of dividend by staking, but YFI in the index won't be staking and COMP won't be engaging in governance, at least not at the beginning.      ""Currently the initial version will be abstaining [from voting]. But in the future we could enable active participation of the token in governance. Or even to generate additional yield,"" Feng said.      Feng described DeFi Pulse as a natural first partner for this product. ""DeFi Pulse is one of the main destinations in DeFi,"" Feng said. ""Given their understanding of all the different projects and their growth, they had really good domain knowledge.""      And as for the target audience, Feng was clear:    ""We are pretty excited to give retail access to DeFi.""",POSITIVE,COMP | YFI,BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | MARKET | TRADING | YFI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/14/new-index-from-defi-pulse-and-set-protocol-offers-easy-access-to-10-defi-tokens-in-1,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da581f3abc28e36c1f780b5ce7e4f7048b4dfe12-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Around 13,000 investors with a total capital pool of $57 million had expressed interest in the Ethereum scaling project SKALE. Around $43 million of that pool was from 4,300 investors who made it through know-your-customer (KYC) checks. Ultimately, SKALE ended up raising $5 million because of regulatory constraints in Liechtenstein, where the nonprofit focused on promoting the SKALE network, the NODE Foundation, is based.      SKALE is a proof-of-stake (PoS) network that aims to run thousands of transactions per second at low cost. Etheruem’s gas fees have skyrocketed in recent months with the network being overwhelmed by demand.      There are more than 50 projects on SKALE that are building and testing, said SKALE CEO Jack O’Holleran. A third of them are decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, another third are gaming projects and the final third are a mixed group.      Activate is part of ConsenSys Codefi, an Ethereum-based operating system for DeFi products.      Read more: ConsenSys Project Launches ‘Proof-of-Use’ Network to Discourage Speculation      Activate sets standards for the purchase, distribution and use of utility tokens. Its “proof-of-use” protocol requires tokens to be usable at or immediately after being sold to participants and that tokens are used for their intended purpose.      Initially, SKALE planned to hold a Dutch auction, but the online auction crashed after it was overloaded by front-running software, according to O’Holleran. SKALE then canceled the auction and had two fixed-price sales that allowed the company to decentralize the network as much as possible.

Top shelf    Hacked again Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol bZx is the victim of yet another hack – this time costing nearly $8 million. On Sunday, an unnamed attacker apparently tricked bZx into minting iTokens, an interest-earning token that allows users to redeem crypto in the protocol’s lending pools, cashing them out for nearly 220,000 LINK tokens, 4,507 ETH, 1.76 million USDT, 1.4 million USDC and 670,000 DAI, CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker reports. Early this year, attackers drained nearly $1 million from the protocol in two separate attacks – raising questions over a DeFi feature called “flash loans.” The latest bug apparently passed through two audits performed by security firms Certik and Peckshield. bZx co-founder Kyle Kistner said the drained funds will be covered by the protocol’s insurance fund, pending community ratification.      In a late breaking twist, a spokesperson said bZx was able to track down the attacker using his or her on-chain activity and that the funds were returned as soon as that person was exposed.      Red flags The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international standards-setting body followed by 200 nations, has recommended regulators profile cryptocurrency users so they can better identify criminal activity. In a Monday report, FATF said regulators should keep an eye out for suspicious behavior including swapping publicly tracked cryptos for privacy coins like monero or zcash, skirting KYC/AML checks and transactions that fall just below the Travel Rule threshold, CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker reports. The watchdog also said a discrepancy between a trader’s transaction history and known wealth is a red flag.      Auto crisis Iran may use crypto to fund car imports. Gholam Hossein Mozaffari, CEO of the Kish Free Zone Organization, has queried the nation’s central bank about using cryptocurrencies mined on Kish Island to beat hyperinflation and international sanctions. ""If the central bank allows this, it [would be] possible to import cars with digital currency for these three free zones, and the car problem can be solved,"" Mozaffari said, according to ArzDigital. In recent months, Iran has loosened regulations to permit crypto mining under certain circumstances.      Diamond ring? Prosecutors have charged a Washington, D.C., man with running a crypto-backed diamond investment ponzi scheme. Jose Angel Aman was charged with wire fraud on Friday for his alleged role in soliciting $25 million from hundreds of investors to fund a scheme where he and his cadres promised to buy and flip diamonds. Court documents say Aman ""rarely"" used investments as promised, instead funding a lavish lifestyle and to pay interest to earlier investors. Prosecutors further allege Aman launched a purported diamond-back cryptocurrency called Argyle Coin to solicit more funds as the scheme neared collapse.      ICO targets Rapper T.I. and seven others were charged with securities violations for their involvement in a pair of initial coin offerings (ICOs). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Friday film producer Ryan Felton misappropriated funds and wash traded cryptocurrencies using the proceeds from the $164,665 FLiK and $282,418 CoinSpark ICOs, while others are said to have recommended investors buy tokens without disclosing they were paid by the projects. The rapper has agreed to pay a $75,000 fine and not participate in any digital asset sales for at least five years; Sparks agreed to pay a $25,000 fine and likewise refrain from participating in any securities sales for five years.

Billing itself a community-driven DeFi experiment, SushiSwap aspired to drain liquidity and users from the dominant, VC-backed AMM Uniswap. It did this by forking Uniswap’s code, instituting a governance token and offering a generous subsidy for liquidity providers (LPs) that migrated over.      On Saturday, the vampire clone cut its block reward from 1,000 tokens to just 100. And it looks like a number of LPs cut town as well.      As of this writing, $776 million worth of crypto is held in Sushi’s smart contracts, down 18% from the previous day, according to sushiswap.vision. Meanwhile, Uniswap’s total value locked (TVL) has spiked 70% day-over-day to $971 million, according to DeFi Pulse.      Last Friday, Messari’s Ryan Selkis drew the terms of the confrontation as being about entrepreneurship and full-decentralization.      “As an entrepreneur I am rooting so f**king hard for uniswap and against everything about sushi. But as a crypto degen, I am loving the ruthless competition and embrace of open source ‘rules,’” he tweeted.    Market intel    Big bitcoin bets Hundreds of derivatives investors are betting bitcoin will rally to $36,000 by the end of 2020. Over the weekend, crypto derivatives exchange Deribit saw a rise in call options (bullish bets) with $36,000 and $32,000 strike prices that expire Dec. 25. Calls give investors the option, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a given time. CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports that the probability of bitcoin reaching a new record high above $20,000 by the end of December is roughly 5%.

42432659,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0flh,1600099250,Most Attacks on Cybersecurity Firm’s Decoy Servers Aimed at Mining Crypto: Report,"An analysis of a year's worth of cyberattacks on ""honeypot"" servers set up by the cybersecurity firm Aqua Security, shows a majority of the attacks targeted earning revenue through mining crypto on compromised servers.      These particular cloud servers were deliberately misconfigured to attract cyberattacks in an attempt to learn how such attacks take place and how to stop them. The study covers the period between June 2019 and July 2020.    According to Aqua's recent report, of the 16,371 attacks on its decoy servers over the last year, 95% were aimed at mining cryptocurrency through deploying malicious programs to hijack the cloud computing power.  The attacks on the firm's misconfigured servers also registered a sharp rise at the beginning of this year, with attacks per day rising from about 12 in December 2019 to 43 per day in June 2020.  While honeypot servers can help understand the methods used by attackers, the report by Alpha Security admits the results might be ""profoundly biased towards a single initial access point,"" indicating that similar studies analyzing multiple compromised access points or a supply-chain attack may reach different conclusions.  Although honeypot serves cannot accurately simulate real-world conditions, they can offer insight into the malicious programs used to compromise cloud servers and the motivations driving such attacks.  Aqua Security's study also found the attacks aimed at mining crypto on its decoy servers appeared to prefer mining monero (XMR) over other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. “We speculate that they choose monero since it is considered significantly more anonymous than bitcoin,” the report noted.  A July report by Microsoft found that while rising volatility and mining difficulties have deterred crypto-mining attacks overall, users in countries such as Singapore, Vietnam and India face a relatively higher risk of being exposed to an attack.

The number one cryptocurrency by market value printed a high of $10,691 at 14:05 UTC, the highest level since Sept. 4, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  The bulls finally led the price action, having shown little interest in the preceding 10 days when the cryptocurrency was stuck in a narrow range of $10,000 to $10,500.  On-chain metrics kept improving despite the price pullback from $12,000 to $10,00 earlier this month. Many expected a breakout.  While bitcoin gained over 3%, gold, a classic haven asset, rose 1% to $1,960 per ounce, according to data source TradingView.  The 60-day correlation between bitcoin and gold recently rose to a record high above 0.5. Correlations move between 0 to 1.  Correlations whose magnitude are between 0.5 and 0.7 indicate the two assets are moderately positively correlated. Above 0.7 means a strong positive correlation, meaning the two assets are moving in tandem.  Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index, which gauges the greenback's value against a basket of major currencies, fell by 0.4%.  Bitcoin has evolved as a macro asset since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in March and has increasingly taken cues from the action in the forex markets and gold in Q3 2020.

42432666,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0g5h,1600090858,The Crypto Firms Collaborating on a Swiss Franc Stablecoin,"The folks building the next generation of digital money in Switzerland understand the need to collaborate.      Stablecoins, digital tokens pegged one-to-one to the Swiss franc (CHF) in this case, are a prime example. SEBA Bank and Sygnum Bank, the two B2B players that hold banking licenses from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority and that specialize in digital assets, are both involved in stablecoin explorations, as is the country’s respected crypto conglomerate, Bitcoin Suisse.      “Within the Crypto Valley and here in Switzerland, there’s a very good collaboration going on, where everyone’s working together to try to design a Swiss franc stablecoin which has more or less the same definition or is fully interoperable,” said Matthew Alexander, SEBA Bank’s head of asset tokenization.      “Coopetition” is an ungainly term at the best of times, while “interoperability” is a word that gets bandied about the blockchain world an awful lot. But it appears that’s what’s happening among Swiss stablecoin issuers.      The end goal, Alexander said, is that “you’ve got something which a consumer, or a central bank or a corporate can trade with anybody else because they know they have the same thing on the other side.”      The Swiss also see the advantage in avoiding the kind of separate and competing currency pairs that have emerged with USD stablecoins like tether (USDT) and USDC.    Swiss stablecoins    Sygnum, which works in partnership with telco giant Swisscom, recently claimed the world’s first e-commerce transaction using a bank-issued stablecoin, the Sygnum Digital Swiss Franc (DCHF).      “We are absolutely in discussion with other players in the ecosystem,” Martin Burgherr, co-head of clients at Sygnum Bank, said on the topic of stablecoins. “To the clients, it’s a new way to transfer assets via a blockchain and this requires some disruption, and disruption is easier if you not only compete but also team up on certain aspects. We think that there will probably be multiple stablecoins for multiple purposes, but agree that you don’t need 200 stablecoins with a Swiss franc common denominator.”      Read more: Crypto Bank Hopeful Bitcoin Suisse Raises $48M in First-Ever Round      Bitcoin Suisse is no stranger to crypto interoperability, having led the OpenVASP network to harmonize global anti-money laundering (AML) standards. The firm’s Swiss Crypto Tokens AG subsidiary was the first of the three to come out with a Swiss franc stablecoin, the CryptoFranc (XCHF).      “Within the Swiss crypto industry, we are in frequent discussion with partners and other stablecoin issuers to see what cooperation and new use cases may make sense for the XCHF and how we can further adoption of cryptocurrencies in general,” said Armin Schmid, CEO of Swiss Crypto Tokens.      All three firms praised the support of the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Asked for comment on the growth of stablecoins in Switzerland, a spokesman for SNB referred to a speech by the bank’s chairman, Thomas Jordan.      “We believe that cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-based tokens are of only limited use as payment instruments, stores of value and units of account because they are subject to major fluctuations,” he said last September. “The picture may be different for stable coins, however.”    Under the hood    Diving into the nuts and bolts, there are two levels of stablecoin interoperability, said SEBA’s Alexander. On the one hand, there’s the relatively straightforward technological design of the coins; on the other, the legal and regulatory underpinnings.      Stablecoins, normally built on the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, have an advantage in Switzerland because they tend to be regulated and audited by firms like PwC or Grant Thornton. Starting out with small projects and experiments, an agreed-upon set of rules and auditing capabilities can be defined.      Read more: Swiss Canton Zug to Accept Taxes in Bitcoin, Ether From Next Year      “It literally becomes like an open banking API, and those who prove capable will be allowed to join the network,” said Patrick Salm, SEBA’s head of token platform. “A lack of collaboration will result in five standards and a race for a standard, which is not efficient.”      Standardized common languages are critical. For example, an attempt to implement a stablecoin such as tether (USDT) or USDC within a core banking system would not work, simply because such systems are not capable of handling a four-character currency unit, Salm pointed out. Currencies, according to ISO definition, are supposed to be three characters.      “It starts with stuff like this,” said Salm. “We’re not just talking about using a four-digit stablecoin as a settlement coin. … It’s really about the deep roots of banking.”    Eurocoin?    Naturally, interoperability is front and center when it comes to establishing a euro stablecoin, said Alexander of SEBA.      “We are trying to help design something that is truly interoperable,” Alexander said, adding:    “If lots of European countries are doing their own definition of a euro, you destroy the idea of a European Union when you reach a border and have to exchange your currency in your electronic wallet. You’ve got to have one definition and one means of operating; otherwise, what’s the point of having an integrated European banking system?”",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/14/the-crypto-firms-collaborating-on-a-swiss-franc-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6db4800b797b045147d82b3b14ed2efd8987cffc-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432649,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0cNh,1600090687,Enterprises Need Third Parties for Oracles to Work,"Paul Brody is a Principal and Global Blockchain Leader at EY.      Oracles, an often overlooked feature of blockchain technology, are having a moment. In ancient times, oracles were people or gods who provided wisdom or knowledge. In blockchains, they are mechanisms for providing sources of truth that did not originate within the system itself.      For much of the blockchain era, especially in the era of cryptocurrencies, oracles have not had a significant role to play. Whether ether or bitcoin or most ICO tokens, everything you need to know about the token, such as ownership and embedded logic, exists on the chain. No external wisdom is needed.      Now, as blockchains find new uses, this long-neglected functionality is suddenly the hottest ticket out there. In the future, they are going to have an important role in enterprise blockchain usage, enabling business and financial operations in both the “real world” (e.g. off-chain) as well on the blockchain. From financial services to product purchase agreements, at least some information from exchange rates to interest rates to proof of shipment delivery is needed from outside the blockchain. And because deals on the blockchain will depend on this information, it’s absolutely critical it is trustworthy.      See also: The Man in Plaid - CoinDesk's ""Most Influential"" Profile of Chainlink's Sergey Nazarov      While many people are interested in oracles for financial services, they will also be essential for implementing enterprise smart contracts. Current models like Chainlink start with the presumption that having multiple parties verify data is better than having a single party. They design a decentralized model from the get-go, and when combined with the ability to invest your stake against the quality of your own reporting, offer a powerful incentive to stay honest.      This model isn’t going to work for most enterprise agreements. And even fancy tools like zero-knowledge proofs will not solve a bigger problem. How do you know if the oracle is being truthful if there is only one source of that information? Spoiler alert: You need an independent third-party for that.      While the multiple-redundancy model may work in many business cases, for a lot of enterprise agreements there is only one source of data. Take a typical agreement between a buyer and a seller of, say, factory equipment. There is an exchange of money for the product, and payment is usually triggered by delivery of the product. This is really the simplest of all enterprise deal models, so let’s take that apart, one piece of truth at a time.      The starting point has to be the question of whether or not the product and money are real. In the case of fiat-backed tokens, you need to know the token issuer has money in the bank equal to that number and, most important, that money in the bank is not committed against other debts.      The same goes for the product to be exchanged. When it comes to triggering payment, the record of delivery from the shipper can be used but, again, only that shipper really has that information, and it is not a disinterested party because it may be penalized for late deliveries or damaged goods.    In short, you need the blockchain-equivalent of an audit.    Nor is there any software-based answer that can address most of these questions. Zero-knowledge proofs are useful in providing answers without disclosing underlying information, but if the underlying data can be manipulated then they aren’t necessarily helpful. If you borrow money from one account to put in another, a software engine looking at that account may conclude you have enough to cover your online tokens even when you do not.      The only sustainable way of solving for reliable oracles, when only a single party can provide that truth, is through a third-party assessment. In short, you need the blockchain-equivalent of an audit, but not something that is only updated once a year with an annual report. Fortunately, such things exist and have done so long before blockchains came around, but they were used for other purposes.    Third parties    These third-party assessments are, it turns out, a staple of the audit business and they come in two main flavors: attestation reports and systems of controls (SOC) reports. Attestation reports are the gold standard, written to the same requirements as a legal audit, and signed by an auditor and backed by the audit firm in question.      SOC reports look more at the process of reporting than the output. Essentially, they certify the company in question has put in place a process and tools to safeguard the accuracy of the reporting, without specifically verifying the content of each output.      I foresee a big future for these reports because they enable truly liquid commerce on blockchains. It should be possible for companies to attach attestation or SOC reporting links to digital tokens, showing which ones have been subjected to a form of verification. It is not practical or scalable for each buyer or seller to have to verify these things all on their own.      See also: Paul Brody - Enterprises Would Use DeFi, if It Weren't so Public      On learning about SOC reporting and attestation reports, many people say it’s contrary to the vision of a trustless blockchain environment. This is true, but that gives too much emphasis to trustless, and not enough to properly decentralized. While cryptocurrencies can indeed be trustless because they exist only on-chain, other forms of commerce require some level of trust.      In fact, a properly decentralized and competitive system can be set up to minimize the amount of trust needed and maximize the efficiency of the ecosystem. Having a third party perform an attestation or issue a SOC report aligns incentive and minimizes conflict of interest. Third parties that do a bad job or are caught lying will lose their business. In a properly decentralized environment, companies will have a choice of third-party providers, keeping competition in the system to drive down prices.      There is also a big difference between trusted third parties having a role in the system and having a permissioned or centralized system. In a genuinely decentralized blockchain environment, there is no absolute requirement to use one of these third-party services. Just like the internet, access to the network is permissionless, and while customers may prefer to buy only from companies that have an SSL certificate issued by a well known authority, users are not prevented from operating without one.      Oracles are of immense importance to the future of blockchain commerce ecosystems. We cannot develop large-scale commerce without trusted inputs. We will need, however, to accommodate multiple approaches to certifying information, including ones that lean on off-chain judgement and verification, not just clever algorithms.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LINK,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/14/enterprises-need-third-parties-for-oracles-to-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/992cb44c713bea6b0a484db6a5c60df01ed518b7-1420x944.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Hong Kong-based payment card and wallet provider said Monday that Chainlink's Price Reference Data – its decentralized oracle network – had been plugged directly into the DeFi wallet, giving users ready access to its price feeds.  Per a press release, Crypto.com said the integration meant users would receive ""highly accurate and transparent prices"" on all assets supported in the wallet.  Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov said the integration means the prices users see will reflect actual market conditions, rather than being the product of ""human tampering.""  Crypto.com launched its wallet earlier this year as a user-friendly means to access the buzzing DeFi space – where total value locked (TVL) ballooned from $600 million at the start of the year to a peak of nearly $10 billion a few weeks ago, according to DeFi Pulse.  Crypto.com has also launched two decentralized data feeds for its native CRO token against U.S. dollars and ether (ETH) ahead of what it said was a ""deeper integration into the rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem.""  Mirroring Binance, Crypto.com launched a swap product last week where users can exchange tokens and where liquidity providers can earn yields by depositing digital assets into token pools.

42432650,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0cXh,1600086866,"First Mover: As Central Banks Print $1.4B an Hour, Bitcoiners Bet on Federal Reserve 'Capture'","$1.4 billion every hour.      According to Bank of America, that's the pace at which central banks around the world have been buying assets since the coronavirus-related lockdowns started in March. Coincidentally or not, the market value of the Nasdaq 100 gauge of tech stocks has climbed at roughly the same pace since then.      It's the kind of comparison one might expect from a bitcoin true believer, steeped in the view that central-bank money printing is debasing the U.S. dollar – sure to bring rampant inflation. But it's almost jarring when the observations instead come from researchers at a Wall Street bank at the center of the traditional financial system and dollar-based economy.      ""For much of the past 10 years, Wall Street has proved too big to fail, and monetary policy markets have implicitly supported asset prices to boost economic growth,"" Bank of America Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett wrote earlier this month in a report. ""In 2020 the policy is more explicitly engineering an overshoot in asset prices.""      That's the backdrop for the Federal Reserve's two-day, closed-door meeting this week, where top U.S. officials will evaluate what is perhaps the loosest monetary-policy stance in the central bank's 107-year history. Interest rates have already been cut close to zero, and the Federal Reserve is buying $80 billion of U.S. Treasurys a month to keep markets afloat, with trillions of dollars more available through emergency-lending programs.      The Fed isn't expected to announce any major changes other than perhaps formalizing a plan that Chair Jerome Powell laid out last month, under which inflation would be allowed to rise above the 2% annual target without triggering immediate rate hikes. The central bank's balance sheet already has expanded this year by about $3 trillion to $7.1 trillion as of last week.      One possibility is that the Fed will hold off announcements of new stimulus until markets take a fresh nosedive. Despite the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubling this year to 8.4%, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks is still up 3.4% on the year, and speculation is growing that the Fed might be unwilling to let stocks fall.      ""The market has just become too reliant on the Fed being there,"" Brian Coulton, chief economist for the sovereign group at the bond-rating firm Fitch, said last week in a phone interview.      Consumer sentiment has dipped in the past few months, but it's nowhere near as low as it was after the 2008 financial crisis. Most economists say the current crisis is much worse.      Imagine how consumers might rein in spending if the stock market tumbled 23%, as it did in the final quarter of 2008. In economics, there's a psychological concept known as the ""wealth effect,"" where consumers spend more if the value of their assets rise, even if their income doesn't change. The reverse is also true.      Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist at the forecasting firm T.S. Lombard, says it's a ""term of art"" trying to gauge how far stocks might have to fall before the Fed would step in.      ""They're not going to step in front of this normal volatility,"" Blitz said. ""They'll get involved when they think it's a move in the equity market that threatens the outlook.""      Bitcoin traders might try to frame the question in billions of dollars per hour.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin is still down 75% from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017, and the market is pricing just a 5% probability of prices setting new lifetime highs by the year's end.      Even so, some traders are buying call options at $36,000 and $32,000 strike prices expiring in December.      ""We saw some out of the ordinary activity in the $36,000 December call"" on Sunday, Luuk Strijers, CCO of Deribit, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""Few buyers with most likely bullish expectations executed these trades.""      Open interest or open positions in the $36,000 December call rose by 752 contracts, and the number of open positions in the $32,000 call rose by 462 contracts, according to data source Skew.

FATF, whose guidance is heeded in more than 200 countries, said in a report Monday that it had identified certain behaviors and characteristics that serve as red flags for regulators trying to detect illegal or illicit transactions.  One of the primary methods, the international financial watchdog said, is to compare a user's transaction activity with that of his or her profile.  This can include instances where a deposit or transaction amount is inconsistent with a user's available wealth or historical financial activity, perhaps signaling money laundering, a scam or a money mule (where someone transfers illicit value on behalf of somebody else).  For instance, it might be suspicious if a young user, with no known business interests, started receiving large amounts in payments of a commercial nature from various parties all around the world.  Other red flags include whether the person in question is much older than the average age of a crypto user, as well as if the person has a criminal record or has been active on websites and public forums associated with illicit activity.  The new report comes over a year after FATF recommended national regulators mandate virtual asset service providers (VASPs) – e.g. exchanges or wallet providers – retain and share identifying information on parties involved in transactions over a certain amount, known colloquially as the Travel Rule.  In Monday's report, the financial watchdog said other red flags include instances where users send crypto to exchanges with no known know your customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) checks, or where they are sending transactions that are just below the Travel Rule threshold.  Regulators might also look at users who exchange digital assets on public and transparent blockchains (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum) for privacy coins, like monero or zcash, which obfuscate or withhold transaction activity from third parties.  Indeed, monero is one of the favored cryptocurrencies for hackers, as it mixes transaction data together making it easy for them to offload stolen value on unsuspecting exchanges.

As of Sunday, call options at $36,000 and $32,000 strike prices expiring on Dec. 25 were seeing the most daily positions opened.  ""We saw some out of the ordinary activity in the $36,000 December call,"" Luuk Strijers, CCO of Deribit, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""Few buyers with most likely bullish expectations executed these trades.""  A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a particular date. A put option represents a right to sell.  Open interest refers to the number of contracts traded, but not squared off with an offsetting position.  The most new open positions were seen in the $36,000 December call, with 752 contracts.  The number of open positions in the $32,000 call rose by 462 contracts.  Relatively small additions were observed in the $28,000 December expiry call, as well as the $9,750 and $9,000 puts expiring this month.  Buy positions in the out-of-the-money $36,000 and $32,000 calls were executed during Sunday's European trading hours when the liquidity was low (wider bid-offer spread).  As such, these traders paid significantly more in costs than they would have incurred on a weekday.  The aggressive weekend trading is a little perplexing, given the options market sees a very low probability of prices reaching a new record high above $20,000 by the end of December.  The odds of bitcoin setting a new lifetime high over $20,000 by the year's end are just 5%, the data suggests, while the likelihood of prices crossing $28,000 is 2%.  Further, the market sees only a 9% chance of bitcoin crossing above $20,000 by the end of Q1 2021.  While prospects of bitcoin rising to $36,000 are quite low, these deep out-of-the-money options are not expensive.  In other words, the maximum loss in this trade is limited to the extent of the price paid to buy the option.  That may have motivated these weekend traders to take a long shot on a new ATH.  At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $10,420. The cryptocurrency has been restricted mostly to a narrow range of $10,500 to $10,000 since Sept. 4.

42432644,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0cLh,1600077530,DeFi Lender bZx Loses $8M in Third Attack This Year,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol bZx has fallen victim to yet another attack after a bug in its code allowed someone to mint tokens they redeemed for cryptocurrencies on the protocol.    Co-founder Kyle Kistner told CoinDesk the company noticed something was wrong on Sunday when a single LINK withdrawal led to a $2.6 million drop in the protocol's total value locked (TVL).  The attack basically centered around the protocol's interest-earning iToken that users receive and redeem for crypto deposited into lending pools.  Kistner said the attacker exploited a bug that tricked bZx into minting unbacked iTokens subsequently exchanged for cryptocurrencies held in the pools.  Per an incident report Sunday, the attacker managed to steal just under 220,000 LINK tokens, 4,507 ETH, 1.76 million USDT, 1.4 million USDC and 670,000 DAI.  At current spot prices, this works out as a loss of just over $8 million.  That's much more than the $630,000 and $350,000 hacks the protocol suffered in February, which both manipulated oracle price feeds in order to pay back bZx loans for far less than the actual amount.  bZx paused the protocol in the aftermath of Sunday's attack so the bug could be patched, and resumed operations hours later.  Kistner said the decision was taken in consultation with security experts, who had not instructed the company to shut down for any longer.  He added the $8 million lost had already been debited by the protocol's insurance fund and will be paid out once the bZx community had ratified it.  The bug managed to remain undetected in two extensive code audits from cybersecurity firms Certik and Peckshield.  Kistner declined to comment on the identity of the hacker.

ArzDigital reported that Gholam Hossein Mozaffari, CEO of the Kish Free Zone Organization, said he hopes an agreement will be reached with the central bank to use cryptocurrency produced in Iran to fund imports.  The Central Bank of Iran had told the organization that because of currency inflation and the current economic conditions in the country it could not provide the funding needed, Mozaffari said.  ""Our next suggestion was that we would provide the required currency through the digital currency produced in the free zones, the origin and amount of which are known, and do not put any pressure on the country's currency,"" he said.  According to reports three weeks ago, inflation in Iran had reached as high as 30% year on year.  U.S.-led sanctions against the nation, as well as endemic corruption and economic mismanagement, are cited as being major factors behind the high inflation level.  According to Mozaffari, cryptocurrencies are already being mined on Kish Island and he hopes to soon meet with the head of the central bank to discuss the possibility of using that income to fund the auto imports.  He would also call on the private sector to launch a cryptocurrency exchange, he said.  ""If the central bank allows this, it [would be] possible to import cars with digital currency for these three free zones, and the car problem can be solved.""  Amid the hyperinflation, Iran's government has been moving to permit cryptocurrency mining, under certain restrictions, to bring in much-needed foreign capital.  In May, President Hassan Rouhani ordered the government to draw up a renewed national approach for the growing industry.

Federal prosecutors in South Florida charged the man, Jose Angel Aman, with wire fraud on Friday.  Allegations include that Aman and his partners had solicited investors in the U.S. and Canada for a diamond investment scheme, saying he would buy rough-colored diamonds and cut, polish and resell them for profit.  Promoting the investment as high return and no risk, Aman said the scheme was backed by a $25 million inventory of diamonds, according to the allegations.  However, the prosecutors claim Aman ""rarely"" used investments to buy rough diamonds and never refined and resold them; the $25 million inventory was also an alleged falsehood.  Aman instead made supposed interest payments to earlier investors using newer investors' money and persuaded investors to roll over their investments by falsely claiming their investments were at full value.  Prosecutors allege that when the scheme, was approaching collapse, Aman launched a purported diamond-back cryptocurrency called Argyle Coin and further solicited investors.  Again, money from later investors was allegedly used to play ""interest"" to earlier investors.  The schemes fleeced ""hundreds"" of investors for over $25 million, according to the charges, while Aman allegedly used some of the funds to ""support his own lavish lifestyle.""  Aman made his initial court appearance in West Palm Beach, Fla., last week.  Back in May, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission moved to halt the operations of Aman, Argyle coin and other entities he operated over similar allegations.
