42376801,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVUp,1389212773,Yahoo Infects 2 Million European PCs with Bitcoin Malware,"For four days last week Yahoo’s European servers were the equivalent of a cyber Typhoid Mary, spreading disease to anyone who came near. Yahoo was the victim of a major security breach, which caused its servers to send out millions of malware-laden ads to an estimated two million European users.  Suspicions were first raised by Dutch security outfit Fox IT, which estimated that Yahoo’s servers were responsible for 27,000 malware infections every hour the malware was live on Yahoo’s website.  Yahoo confirmed the embarrassing attack in a statement:  “From December 31 to January 3 on our European sites, we served some advertisements that did not meet our editorial guidelines – specifically, they spread malware.""  The statement went on to point out that mobile users and Mac users were not affected, as the malware apparently targeted Windows systems, The Guardian reports.  Bitcoin mining malware was involved  One rather interesting aspect of the attack was that it involved bitcoin mining. The malware would start using infected PCs as mining rigs but it is still unclear how many computers were infected. Although the average PC with an integrated graphics processor is virtually useless for bitcoin mining, tens of thousands of PCs laden with mining malware could produce some results.  In late 2013 German police arrested two hackers who were charged with spreading mining malware to several networks and an undisclosed number of PCs. Following a preliminary investigation, authorities concluded that the duo managed to mine over €700,000 worth of bitcoins. Since they did not have to invest in mining rigs, or pay the electric bill for that matter, it seemed like a very profitable endeavour – until they were raided by the GSG-9, Germany’s elite counter-terrorist police unit.  Little is known about the bitcoin malware served by Yahoo. The German hacker-miners appear to have used a custom version of readily available malware, tweaking it to include a mining scrip and evade detection.  Cyber criminals and bitcoin  Developing and spreading bitcoin mining malware is not easy and with a rapid increase in hash difficulty it will soon be a thing of the past. PCs have not been viable bicoin mining platforms for months and the only way to make any cash on PC bitcoin mining is if you don’t have to buy the hardware or electricity. At this point a network of average PCs will waste more energy generating bitcoins than the bitcoins are worth. Of course, malware is one way of doing it.  In addition to mining malware, some malicious developers have devised a new form of ransomware. The number of bitcoin ransomware detections is going up and the trend was first noticed in the second half of 2013. Ransomware has been around for two decades, but bitcoin is making it a lot more alluring for malicious developers. The software encrypts all content on infected computers and instructs the victims to pay a ransom for the unlock key. Cryptolocker’s ransom is two bitcoins, or about $1,700.  There are a number of different ransomware models that could evolve to use bitcoin. Security experts have also voiced concerns that mobile ransomware could become a major security risk in the near future.  What makes bitcoin so valuable to cyber criminals?  Aside from the sheer value of stolen or illegally mined bitcoins, anonymity is probably the main reason hackers are embracing bitcoin. Renting a botnet costs money and bitcoin is perfect for untraceable transactions between two parties that don’t want to share their identity. The same is true of ransomware – using bitcoin to receive a ransom payment makes sense.  Acquiring specialized software, proprietary hardware, zero-day exploits and other tools used by hackers requires quite a bit of cash. Contrary to what most people think, many hackers do not operate alone. Although there are still plenty of 'lone wolves', the cybercrime ecosystem has evolved.  Like any economic entity, it has a hierarchy and what could only be described as division of labour is taking hold. In other words, many hackers are specializing in different niches and cybercrime syndicates are becoming more sophisticated, with a structure similar to traditional criminal syndicates or even legitimate businesses.  As bitcoin is ideal for paying accomplices and funding the whole operation, it is bound to see more use in the murky waters of the deep web.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/08/yahoo-infects-2-million-european-pcs-with-bitcoin-malware,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5373b259a9813c03e58c18d40edd958a16af866b-1000x696.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The area, made famous by Psy’s world-conquering 2012 hit song ‘Gangnam Style’, now has a bitcoin-accepting hair and beauty salon, called With Beauty Salon.  Their head of marketing, Lee Kyung Won, told a local blogger he hoped that bitcoin would “attract trend-setters who are the kind of people we are looking for as customers”.  The blogger, Kim Dong-Hyun, appears to have been their first bitcoin-paying customer on 2nd January. It’s not clear what treatment the self-described “office worker in his mid-30s” had, but he’s confident bitcoin would permeate South Korean society quickly if merchants began to accept it. “Koreans are very sensitive to IT trends,” he wrote.  According to coinmap.org, Seoul currently has seven bitcoin-accepting businesses, including a baguette shop and a service that lets you load up a pre-paid VISA card with bitcoin.  With Beauty Salon began accepting bitcoin on 30th December 2013 after the head of marketing raised the idea. He was apparently less optimistic about how many of his customers would actually end up using bitcoin, saying that the payment option would be most useful for foreigners staying in country.  Closer to home, a London hair clinic recently completed a hair transplant that was paid for in bitcoin. Vinci Hair Clinic has apparently been “inundated” with requests to pay for procedures in bitcoin and with many of their customers flying in from abroad, they say bitcoin payments help them avoid international transaction fees.  Additionally, paying with bitcoin would also help protect the privacy of customers who may not want anyone to know they’ve had the procedure.

42376807,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eVYb,1389198626,"Belgium Central Bank Remains Positive About Bitcoin, Unofficially","The National Bank of Belgium doesn't have any plans to regulate bitcoin further, according to the Belgian Bitcoin Association.  Belgium's central bank met with the Association to discuss the digital currency last Monday, describing the meeting as ""informal"".  ""There are currently no plans for new regulations in Belgium that would allow the [central bank] to take a more intervening [sic] stance – though future regulations to that effect cannot be excluded,"" read a statement from the association.  Thomas Spaas, a board member who represented the Belgian Bitcoin Association at the meeting, said that although the meeting was informal and did not reflect the central bank's official position, he expected Belgium to adopt a similar position to France, the Netherlands and Germany, where bitcoin is considered to be beyond the scope of current regulations.  Spaas also said that the central bank would likely issue a risk warning to investors similar to statements issued by other central banks in Europe. The association's statement on the meeting said the central bank welcomed businesses and organisations dealing in bitcoin to contact them if they had any doubts about the current regulatory regime.  The Belgian Bitcoin Association put a positive spin on the meeting:  ""All in all, the Belgian Bitcoin Association welcomes the current open and positive attitude of the Belgian National Bank. [The association] intends to have similar meetings with the other Belgian government agencies involved in any regulation of bitcoin in Belgium.""  Spaas said the meeting was attended by two central bank officials — a payment services expert and a representative from the legal department — and himself. He described the officials as ""pretty well informed"" about bitcoin.  Dutch exchange Bitplaats opened a Belgian portal two weeks ago to meet demand from Belgian users.  Belgium, a country with a population of 11 million and a per capita GDP larger than Germany, is still shaking off years of political and financial problems triggered by the global financial crisis of 2008. Its biggest banks are still paying back hundreds of millions of euros to the state for bailouts that were made during the crisis. Spaas said:  ""I think the Belgian authorities are more preoccupied with issues other than bitcoin, which gives [the digital currency] some leeway. But if the contacts we've had with the National Bank of Belgium are anything to go by, it seems like bitcoin in Belgium will have a fair chance.""

Bitstamp, a Slovenia-based bitcoin exchange, is currently the number two globally for trading between the United States dollar and bitcoin by volume, according to Bitcoin Charts.  Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of Coinsetter, told CoinDesk:  “Coinsetter is a low-latency, high-uptime trading platform for bitcoin. Our trading engine is approximately 10 times faster than other exchanges on the market, and we are spending time optimizing it further. I view us as a base of stability for reliable trading.”  The Coinsetter blog post announcing the news made it clear that market-based Bitstamp orders will be filled on the platform. Customers will also be able to trade in and out of orders directly from Coinsetter traders as well. The post explains:  “Market orders and marketable limit orders will be filled on Coinsetter’s consolidated order book, which will include quotes from both Bitstamp and other Coinsetter customers. As you trade, out-of-market limit orders will rest on Coinsetter’s order book, and we will fill those orders when they are matched by a quote on Bitstamp or when matched by the order of another Coinsetter user.”  According to the post, Coinsetter makes it clear that it plans to add other bitcoin exchanges in the future. That could give investors some interesting opportunities given the differing bitcoin prices on various exchanges.  The blog post continues:  “Our goal is to aggregate other popular exchanges into our order book to provide one of the most liquid points of access to the bitcoin market.”  Lukasiewicz also told CoinDesk that Coinsetter plans to bring on additional currency pairs for bitcoin trading, including the Euro: “We absolutely plan to offer additional currency pairs in the future.”  The company’s strategy is to act as an electronic communications network (ECN), allowing users to access to multiple exchanges for investing. CoinDesk recently reported that Coinsetter is in the process of raising another $1.5m in order to hire more developers to help build its product.  However, Coinsetter faces some stiff competition. Singapore-based itBit recently raised $3.5m to create a NASDAQ-powered bitcoin exchange. iBit is hiring full stack developers in New York.  As it stands, Coinsetter is in limited beta. Interested traders should sign up for the platform’s waiting list to get in queue for a beta access code.  Lukasiewicz explained: “We have sent out less than 1,500 beta codes to date.

42422934,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1ymjh,1389188122,Slovakia Sets Record Straight on Europe's First Bitcoin ATM,"A Slovakian bitcoin ATM operator wants to set the record straight on the topic of Europe's first bitcoin ATM.  That title is currently claimed by a machine installed in the Helsinki Central railway station in Finland. There has also been considerable media hype around a Swedish machine that was touted as the continent's pioneering ATM dealing in the digital currency.  But Marian Jancuska, who operates the ATM in Bratislava, Slovakia's capital city, says neither Scandinavian country can claim the honour, because his machine was installed before either one. He said:  ""I am glad bitcoin ATMs are growing in momentum [in Europe]. But I would like to set things straight.""  Jancuska's ATM was 'permanently' installed in downtown Bratislava on 8th December, six days before the Finnish ATM was set up. The Bratislava ATM is mounted on a metal stand that's bolted to the wall and floor. It's located near the entrance of a branch of a well-known restaurant chain called The Pub.  Because bitcoin ATMs are often operated on a temporary basis or as demonstration units during events, it's useful to distinguish between those uses of an ATM with a permanent installation, where the machine can be expected to be located for the foreseeable future.  CoinDesk earlier reported on Finnish exchange Bittiraha's claim that it had installed Europe's first permanent bitcoin ATM on 16th Dec. The machine is located inside a branch of a popular record store chain in the heavily trafficked Helsinki Central railway station.  Bratislava ATM details  Jancuska's ATM is a Lamassu unit, so it only converts fiat currency to bitcoin and not the other way around. Jancuska currently charges a 3% fee per transaction, although he says he is working to reduce it to 1%.  The wallet linked to Jancuska's ATM has recorded 290 transactions to date. It has received 82.74 BTC (about $75,000) and has a current balance of about 7.46 BTC (about $6,771).  Jancuska says he only knows his ATM customers by their wallet addresses, since using the ATM doesn't require handing over any identity information, and he prefers to keep it that way.  However he said interest in bitcoin in Slovakia appears to have spread from technology professionals and enthusiasts to the mainstream, aided by interest in the topic from local media. Jancuska says he's happy with the ATM's current location, although he would consider making it available for one-off events as well.  Slovakia's bitcoin scene  Bratislava has an active bitcoin community, according to Jancuska. CoinDesk reported on the Bratislava Subway franchise that laid claim to being the first franchised outlet of the sandwich chain to accept bitcoin. That Subway outlet is owned by Martin Petrus, who also runs an exchange in Slovakia.  Jancuska's ATM made an appearance at Petrus' Subway for two weeks. The pair met when Jancuska did a demo of the ATM at ProgressBar, a popular Bratislava hackerspace. Jancuska said:  ""[Martin Petrus] suggested I place the ATM in his restaurant until it was ready for installation downtown. I liked the idea so the ATM spent about two weeks at Subway. It became a unique place where you could both get bitcoins and spend them.""  Despite Slovakia's evident interest in bitcoin adoption, the international media appears to have been slow to pick up on stories from the eastern European country. The Bratislava ATM's installation, for example, was overshadowed in the media by announcements from Sweden and Finland, for example.  Even Petrus' move to accept bitcoin at his Subway franchise came to light belatedly, after other outlets of the global sandwich chain were hailed for being the first to adopt bitcoin.  ""Despite [bitcoin] activity happening here, its not reported [by] international media,"" Jancuska said.  ATM operator  Jancuska operates his ATM and runs his technology consultancy, called 0011. The 35-year-old who hails from eastern Slovakia says mainly works with financial institutions in his capacity as a consultant.  Jancuska bought his first bitcoin fractions in early 2012. He subsequently purchased whole bitcoins from Mike Gogulski, who is noted for being one of a small number of Americans who have renounced their citizenship to become stateless. Gogulski is also a software developer and bitcoin enthusiast who lives in Bratislava.  Jancuska paid Lamassu 50 BTC (nearly $50,000 at today's rate) for his machine, a move that he says he doesn't regret. For Jancuska, with Bratislava's bitcoin ATM firmly located in the annals of the cryptocurrency's history, there is little debate about the machine's future:  ""The future of the ATM in Bratislava should be quite clear — it should simply provide the service it's meant for."" He added, ""I still need to add some signs and stickers to it.""

42422941,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yn3h,1389184254,Removing Barriers from Bitcoin's Evolution Will Accelerate its Adoption,"Bitcoin is the first large-scale, peer-to-peer, cryptocurrency platform experiment that has a real chance to make a significant impact on how we use money around the world.  To begin to understand it, you need to think of it as an open “money platform”, and not just a new type of currency. Once you detach its currency-related speculative and volatile characteristics; within its own ecosystem, Bitcoin attacks the traditional money supply chains and breaks down traditional barriers and conventional practices.  That is why it is feared by some, misunderstood by many, and embraced by the early few. But its long-term success is not assured. It must be guided, and it must be focused.  – Andreas Antonopoulos, Bitcoin expert  I’ve recently become a huge proponent of Bitcoin, as a result of my own analysis, not anyone else’s.  Earlier, I wasn’t against it. I was neutral, because I couldn’t understand it at a level where I could form a defensible opinion without pandering to other viewpoints. I kept asking questions, and kept receiving fewer answers than I was hoping for, even from those who had invested in it. But that didn’t deter my optimism for bitcoin’s future.  Then I reached the conclusion that one of the issues that is currently hurting bitcoin’s prospects is a lack of clarity around its future, in the eyes of users. Furthermore, the challenges and barriers surrounding Bitcoin’s evolution are not being addressed systematically.  We can’t just say: “let the market develop”. A mess, with the passage of time and some experimentation, doesn’t always result in a less messy situation. Sometimes, things get worse if a path isn’t given some guidance.  I’m suggesting that it’s time to put some order and simplicity in the mind of people about what Bitcoin is, what it’s not, what it could be, and what needs to happen around it.  That order needs to be simple, and without obfuscations of jargon that is incomprehensible to the average person. Let’s not forget that the future of Bitcoin will depend on the average person’s understanding, which will precede their usage of it. No one will use something they don’t comprehend, at least up to a minimum level of understanding.  Bitcoin’s early days  Bitcoin today is a little like the Internet in its early days, around 1994. It’s equally full of excitement and skepticism. But the Internet turned out to be a wonderful thing, as the excited group won over the skeptics.  That didn’t occur by happenstance, or by sheer enthusiasm or market forces.  It happened because, early on, we were able to identify the challenges to the Internet’s commercialization, and one by one, they were tackled, such that the barriers of entry kept getting smaller and lower, and the opportunities became larger and more reachable.  I saw this up close with the Internet, circa 1994, having participated in the advocacy of its early commercialization, via my affiliation with CommerceNet.  The company's sole purpose was to help remove the barriers to adoption, evangelize its vision, and expose its benefits, by working on technological, educational, legal and regulatory initiatives that lubricated the Internet’s early development days.  Today, Bitcoin’s challenges are larger than its known opportunities, at least to the extent that they could be easily understood by the average person. We need to fix that gap, if we want Bitcoin to flourish.  Attacking it via a Framework Approach  We need to look at Bitcoin holistically using a Catalyst-Barrier-Solution framework perspective. This framework consists of accurately depicting the Catalysts: Business Drivers and Technology Enablers.  Second, we need to table the Barriers that include Market, Legal/Regulatory, and Behavioral/Educational Challenges. Finally, we need to tackle the Solutions to each one of these barriers, one by one.  There should not be any illusions about the reality needed here. If we ignore the issues behind these barriers, many of them will not get solved on their own, nor will they go away.  The message behind this framework is to help us focus on what’s important. Magical things start to happen when business drivers are strong, when technology enablers are ready, and when solutions to challenges are found.  So, I’ve made this attempt to list them below, according to this framework. I have used a very similar framework in 1996 to depict the Internet’s characteristics in my book Opening Digital Markets, but have adapted it for Bitcoin.  Business drivers  Money transfer fees are too high  Internet missing a native software protocol for payments  Money transfers cannot be accomplished without an intermediary  Money transfer process is too complicated  Money settlement timeframes are too long  Too many players involved in the process of money transfers  Peer-to-peer transfers are not easy to accomplish  Micro-transactions are still a challenge, and not widespread  Technology enablers  Strong underlying cryptography  Reliable mining process that is part of its resiliency  Decentralized transactions, no choking point  Globally decentralized ledger of assets  Digital signatures (can’t be forged, but can be securely verified)  Transparent transactions  Intrinsic payment protocol, native to the Internet  Distributed blockchain process is very reliable  Multiple APIs exist  Natively peer-to-peer  Anti-fragile system: any weaknesses are fixed by a change in behavior  Doesn’t need a third party to authenticate (blockchain does it via proof of work)  Technical challenges  Underdeveloped infrastructure  Lack of applications  Scarcity of experienced developers  Immature middleware and tools  Not yet well integrated into the fabric of the Internet  Market challenges  Competition from other digital wallets  Integration with existing POS not widespread  History of failed prior attempts at digital currencies  Perception that it enables fraud and criminal activities  Mining bitcoins consumes a lot of energy  Few retail locations where you can buy with Bitcoin  Volatility of currency value  Large number of currency speculators  Legal/regulatory barriers  Unclear regulation  No protection or guarantees on transactions  Irreversible transactions, even on incorrect ones  Risks of government blockage  First currency that doesn’t have a sovereign entity behind it  Several governments issuing Bitcoin warnings  Behavioral/educational challenges  Difficulty in understanding it  Bitcoin’s usability is not great  Perception that it’s led by anti-banking motives  Buying or spending bitcoins is still not easy  Unclear safety and security of using it  The lists above may be incomplete, but the bullets give you an idea about what we need to focus on, in order to continue to assure the success of bitcoin.  It is surprising to note that the list of consumer behavioural challenges is not that long, because users want simplicity: they want to be able to understand it, believe that it is safe and secure, that it’s available, and that they can use it as easily as they can operate their smartphone.  The bitcoin landscape  Another way to understand Bitcoin is by portraying its evolution around three successive layers of architecture.  I’ve again borrowed from a popular segmentation method I used in the late 90s to explain the Internet. First, you basically need a strong set of infrastructure capabilities as foundational elements. For the Internet, it was TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.  Then, you need to see a number of middleware services that are built on top of the infrastructure. Finally, thousands of applications will flourish by relying on the infrastructure and middleware services, as they get built on top of them.  There is a certain required sequence of iterative evolution to this landscape depiction, but it can serve as a clear visual representation of reality.  Understanding the user vision  The groundswell activity around Bitcoin technologies is mind-boggling. Thousands of software engineers in hundreds of companies are developing innovative services and applications around Bitcoin because they have seen its future, and it has captured their imagination.  But the bitcoin vision that matters is the one that users see, because they are the ultimate proof of Bitcoin’s success.  There is enlightenment in noting that from a user adoption angle, Bitcoin’s skepticism is lower in less-developed countries where monetary systems are frail and corruption is rampant.  There, people are seeing Bitcoin as an efficient and liberating system, away from the grips of central government mediocrity. We must follow their lead, because they are seeing the effects of decentralized money when it empowers them.  After all, Bitcoin’s vision in the eyes of its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto was very simple: “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”  a) An incredibly easy and cheap way to transfer money between people  b) An alternative currency to pay for retail products and services  c) An easy way to add a payment option to products and services without a central gatekeeper  That is the essence of Bitcoin, at the consumer level. Of course, there are derivative business related products that will exist (ref. the applications segment in the above slide), but if we don’t get past the critical mass of adoption at the consumer level, none of the other services will matter.  Getting educated on bitcoin  Moving forward, we all need to get better educated on bitcoin. We need to understand it, and help others that don’t understand it yet. If you have one hour to invest, I strongly recommend this seminal video by Andreas Antonopoulos. I have not heard anyone more articulate about bitcoin than Andreas.  We need to address bitcoin’s challenges, collectively, and systematically. Perhaps, what is lacking is some authoritative consortium organism that sets and re-enforces the required agenda, and lubricates the work that is required to remove the barriers, whether perceived or real. Few of the challenges will disappear if we ignore them. Most will need to be tackled head-on.  Therefore, we may need to fund a new organization, or strengthen an existing one, as a non-profit organization that will be recognized as a global authority on Bitcoin, and whose sole mission will be to educate, remove barriers, advocate, and combat legal and regulatory barriers that are being erected to block Bitcoin’s success.  This type of organization could take a page from what CommerceNet did, circa 1994-2001 (you’ll need to review web pages prior to 2001, because CommerceNet’s direction changed after).  Conclusions  Bitcoin cannot be above the law, around it, nor under it. It needs to deal with the existing perceptions about its safety and security, and it needs to turn many of its detractors into supporters. Ignoring all of them will not help.  We need less negative punditry around Bitcoin. There has been a recent flurry of opinions written by known authors who have attacked bitcoin, but in that process they have shown their ignorance or lack of education about it. A bitcoin-supported money system is going to happen. There is no question about it. It is unstoppable.  So, let us work on putting a little more order and guidance into its evolution, removing or lowering barriers, tackling challenges, accurately describing its vision, and focusing on innovation around its application. Now is the time to elevate bitcoin’s evolution and put it on the right path of global support. Bitcoin’s success is urgently needed.

West’s lawyers filed a cease-and-desist order against the team of coders who developed Coinye West, claiming trademark infringement.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the document was filed on 6th January and it is going after the coders because the design of the coin features a cartoon of West.  The documents explains:  “Given Mr West’s wide-ranging entrepreneurial accomplishments, consumers are likely to mistakenly believe that Mr West is the source of your services.”  The currency was supposed to launch on Sunday, but instead of being intimidated by the cease-and-desist order, the coders have actually chosen to bring the launch forward.  The Coinye West team wrote on the redesigned homepage:  “Due to legal pressure, we will be launching today, January 7, at 7:00PM, Pacific Standard Time.”  As if that wasn’t enough, they redesigned the image which was cited in the complaint. The new design still features a cartoon of Kanye West, but it is a lot less flattering.  It depicts Kanye as a fish (South Park fans should get the joke). Ironically, Kanye was parodied in South Park for not getting a simple joke conceived by one of the show’s protagonists.  Taking legal action against a team of coders who clearly have a healthy sense of humour probably won’t help Kanye’s reputation in certain circles.  The original ‘Fishsticks’ episode of South Park aired in 2009 and even West said it was funny, although he admitted it hurt his feelings.  Matt Stone and Tray Parker chose to mock Kanye West again, just a few weeks ago. If they happen to be bitcoin fans, who knows, maybe they’ll do it again.  Kanye’s lawyers have a valid point – using celebrity photos and puns to promote a product is a questionable practice to say the least.  However, apart from having a good sense of humour, the developers obviously know a thing or two about trademark law. Certain parodies of trademarks are permissible, including artistic and editorial parodies that are protected by the First Amendment in the US.  Therefore their decision to redesign the coin and mock Kanye even further makes perfect sense.

BTC China has had an interesting year. In April 2013 the company set the world record for bitcoin's highest value, becoming the world's most active exchange by November.  A solid regulatory rattle by the People's Bank of China in December saw worldwide values plunge and Chinese exchanges jockey for market share using a variety of strategies.  [post-quote]  Bitcoin value hit a record peak of $1,242 on Mt.Gox on 4th December 2013. It began to plunge, though, after China's central bank issued a statement the following day forbidding financial institutions from participating in the bitcoin market.  Shortly after that, the authorities began to restrict access to third-party payment providers as well.  The subsequent action was ""a shock and a devastating blow"" for BTC China, according to CEO Bobby Lee, who described those December days as his company's ""darkest hours"".  Price volatility could have been the problem. BTC China had reduced trading fees to a ""promotional"" 0% in September, but the market quickly overheated as high-frequency traders and speculators leapt in.  ""If we'd known what was coming in December, we wouldn't have done this,"" admitted Lee.  Trading fees  The company attempted to deal with the issue by raising fees to 0.3% in mid-December. However, this – together with lack of access to bank deposits – saw BTC China's volumes dwindle to under 1,000 BTC per day.  Lee had expected other exchanges to follow suit with fee increases designed to appeal to the People's Bank. Since then, BTC China has fallen to third place in the China's bitcoin trading market as competing exchanges kept their fees low or simply non-existent. Lee said:  ""All our competitors have flocked back to a 0% fee structure. Which we know is not what people want to see. It only benefits speculators, it only benefits high-frequency day traders – it doesn't benefit the regular people who want to buy bitcoin, nor does it benefit the bitcoin miners who want to sell bitcoin, because of the high volatility.""  He added: ""We are holding our principle. It's not that we want to take money from our users – that's not it at all. We want a healthy long-term bitcoin ecosystem.""  ""We want to work closely with regulators and we want to play by the rules they want: which is low volatility, and friction. They want friction. They don’t want to see a situation where we have 0% fees and speculation is rampant and large volatility and price swings.""  ""We have high confidence that that's what the PBOC wants to see.""  BTC China this week announced a new fee structure. Under the new system, CNY withdrawal fees are reduced from 1% to 0.5% and a new ""maker-taker"" fee model will apply to transactions.  ""Maker-taker"" is a system whereby those posting multiple buy/sell offers and increase liquidity in the market (""makers"") are paid a fee, whereas those who take the offers and remove market liquidity (the ""takers"") are charged a fee. The fees received and given back (as in BTC China's case) are equal, resulting in zero trading profit for the exchange.  ""We are giving the fee to the market makers: the people who put in a limited order, waiting for you to buy or sell your bitcoin. We feel very confident and we hope to dominate the market with this model.""  Lee called it a ""reverse rebate"" system, saying it was part of BTC China's goal to help bitcoin in the Chinese market more than to earn revenue for the company. It does not make any profit from this fee structure but intends to use it to prevent the kind of ""free-for-all"" that may have caused last year's troubles.  Vouchers  China's other bitcoin exchanges have dealt with the new situation regarding financial institutions and transfers in their own way. Some have continued to accept deposits into personal or corporate accounts.  BTC China sees that as a temporary measure not conducive to bitcoin's longer-term success, and one that could get companies mired in regulatory and taxation issues down the road.  Lee's company now has a ""voucher system"" for users to upload and withdraw funds. In legal terms, this is different to a third-party payment processor: anyone who wants to enter the market must first purchase a voucher code, which they can use to buy bitcoins.  Withdrawal works in the reverse direction, buying vouchers for bitcoin which are then sold to a separate company for local cash.  Threats to central banks  Perhaps it's the near-vertical rise in bitcoin's value over the past couple of months that spooked central banks internationally to issue warnings. It has resulted in a range of responses from hands-off cautionary solutions (Malaysia, Singapore, Germany) to more active attempts to cool bitcoin trading down (India, China).  The US has taken an investigative approach while authorities in other large economies, such as the UK and Japan, have remained silent. Referring to the Chinese authorities' December bans, Lee said:  ""If prices rocket again, we risk that third hammer hitting, which won't be good for anyone in China. So that is why we want to moderate prices in bitcoin.""  It's not an attempt to manipulate the market, he added, just a pragmatic view of political realities in his country and others.  Long-term view  BTC China's trading volumes may have plummeted in December, but they have since recovered to a more robust 20,000 BTC per day under the new maker-taker fee system.  Precise data on the trading volume of other Chinese exchanges is difficult to judge, with researchers having to rely on the statistics they publish on their own pages.  As well as taking a transparent approach to BTC China's fortunes, Lee also wants to maintain a long-term view of bitcoin in China, saying trading volumes are a secondary indicator and that everyone is always at the mercy of any new regulation.  ""We think we are a long-term player and we have funding so we're not running away – we're not going anywhere,"" he said.  ""Our volumes are healthy now and we're not going to die without a fight.""

42425232,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfJh,1389146194,US Senator Tom Carper Sees 'Good Things' in Bitcoin,"The head of an influential Senate committee on virtual currencies today warned against ""killing the baby in the cradle"" by over-regulating bitcoin.  Senator Tom Carper said that there were ""good things"" in the virtual currency, and likened the current situation to the early days of the Internet.  Speaking to the news outlet CNBC  , the Democrat senator for Delaware admitted that he knew ""next to nothing"" about bitcoin and virtual currencies six to 12 months ago, shortly before he chaired a hearing by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in November.  Senator Carper likened bitcoin to the Internet when it first became a commercially significant entity. “Some said that it had some upside potential. Some people said it had some downside potential too, with drug transactions and trafficking and money laundering, all kinds of downsides. But the early message for the Internet was let’s not kill the baby in the cradle,” he said.  He identified similar upsides and downsides for bitcoin: “We know that there are some good things that can happen. It can enhance transactions between sellers and buyers, it can actually help international trade, lower the cost of transactions.” He continued:  “The theme that emerged from our hearing was 'let’s keep an eye on the bad stuff, tamp it down, find out what kind of legislation that we need in order to tamp it down', and that’s what we’re doing.”  The Senator praised federal agencies such as the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security for working together to analyze virtual currencies.  “I think they’re on top of it,” he said. “I was pleasantly surprised to see that they’re communicating with each other, they’re collaborating with each other.” The IRS has yet to issue firm guidance on taxation for bitcoin.  His committee had mailed several such agencies to ask for their policies and procedures regarding virtual currencies. In November, shortly before the hearing, the committee identified a ""keen interest"" in the phenomenon among them.  The Bitcoin Foundation applauded Carper’s softly-softly approach on bitcoin.  “It seems that Senator Carper and the Bitcoin Foundation agree that valuable resources and energy is ill-spent trying to solve hypothetical DC problems,” said a spokesperson, pointing to a “green light” from Washington to build out bitcoin-related businesses.  Jered Kenna, CEO of Tradehill, a bitcoin exchange for high net-worth individuals, is still unable to operate as an exchange after his key banking relationship fell through in August following regulatory issues.  “I don't see as much of a need for new regulation as deciding where bitcoin fits within the existing structure,” Kenna said. “If something is illegal with cash then it should be illegal with bitcoin. You shouldn't expect to be able to gamble or avoid paying taxes just because you're using bitcoin.”  Capitol Hill image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/08/us-senator-tom-carper-sees-good-things-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fdd4b0e992788fad01f2650db6f6a198b621989-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
