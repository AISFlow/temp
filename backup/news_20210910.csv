The report, which cited three unnamed sources, said the meetings with banks and other organizations, including a Friday meeting, considered potential regulation and related topics  According to two of the sources, the Treasury officials inquired if stablecoins would need direct oversight if demand for them increased markedly.  The officials also inquired how regulators might limit the risk potentially occurring if too many people tried to cash in their stablecoins at roughly the same time, and whether the most significant stablecoins should have traditional assets’ backing.  In addition, the meetings covered how stablecoins could be structured and used and whether there is sufficient regulatory structure in place to address security concerns.  The officials seemed to be collecting information and did not offer opinions on potential regulatory moves, according to one individual cited in the article.

Interested participants have been invited to fill out an application via Google Forms, according to a tweet by a16z’s Alex Kroeger.  According to the application, a16z is also seeking delegates for its stake in decentralized derivatives exchange dYdX and stablecoin platforms Maker and Fei.  The announcement comes weeks after a blog post on a16z’s website revealed that the firm would “open source” its delegation procedures, which some critics have said lacked transparency. A spokesperson for Andreessen Horowitz did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.  Token delegation is a process in decentralized finance whereby the holder of a governance token outsources its corresponding vote to a third-party, reducing the voting power held by early investors and founders. The process also allows those more informed or more active in the protocol’s governance to have a stronger voice. However, the original holder would retain their ownership – and economic interest – in the token.  Applicants will be graded across nine metrics, which include commitment to the protocol, subject matter expertise, diversity of perspectives and other criteria. A16z will score prospective delegates on a scale of 0-2 for each category, with a maximum possible score of 18. Generally, candidates with a minimum score of 13/18 or higher (over 70%) advance, according to an example rubric of the current Uniswap delegates.  A16z’s existing token delegates for Uniswap and Compound include a mix of university organizations, non-profits, startups and community leaders, including Harvard Law School’s Blockchain and Fintech Initiative, Kiva, Gauntlet and Getty Hill.  A16z, which runs three cryptocurrency funds managing over $3 billion in assets, has increased its effort to address governance and regulatory issues associated with its cryptocurrency investments.  A new, four-person team led by a16z partner Jeff Amico will focus on protocol governance, as CoinDesk previously reported.

Background RiperDeFi&apos;s CEO, James Yau, has been an active member of the farming community for over a decade. As a result of being directly involved in the industry, James noticed numerous points of concern in the agricultural sector. Firstly, large buyers can secure lower prices by making big orders; in return, banks and governments incentivize them with more favorable terms, grants and subsidies. Thus, farmers often find themselves giving up large amounts of crops for very little in return. There is also no access to micro-financing in times of economic difficulty. In the event that their customers fail to pay or become bankrupt, farmers would lose out on their payments completely with no options for recourse.

The sell-off appears to be stabilizing, although many alternative coins in the CoinDesk 20 are underperforming bitcoin over the past seven days.  Bitcoin was trading around $45,000 at press time and is down about 8% over the past week. Some analysts expect BTC to consolidate with support nearby at the 200-day moving average, although resistance remains strong around the $50,000 price level.  “Tuesday’s liquidations were possibly exacerbated by the leverage embedded in the Ethereum market and the wider altcoin universe,” FundStrat, a global advisory firm, wrote in a newsletter published on Wednesday. “The macro and on-chain (blockchain) pictures remain consistent, and therefore we believe these mid-cycle liquidations are good opportunities to consolidate positions.”  Analysts and traders are also monitoring regulatory risk, which could damp sentiment in the crypto market.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $45,701, -1.2%  Ether (ETH): $3,326, -3.2%  S&P 500: -0.8%  Gold: $1,797, +0.3%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.339%  Regulatory concerns  Recent headlines suggest the global regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies is not over. On Thursday, the State Power Company of China announced that it is conducting inspections on bitcoin and other crypto mining facilities.  “The article stated that virtual currencies such as bitcoin waste energy and evade financial supervision, and have no clear legal status in China,” crypto newswire WuBlockchain tweeted.  Also on Thursday, Sweden’s Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves warned that “private money usually collapses sooner than later” during a banking conference. Ingves also compared bitcoin to “trading in stamps” and expressed concerns about money laundering.  And last week, the European Securities and Markets Authority published a report stating that “crypto assets are highly volatile in price and operate outside of the existing EU (European Union) regulatory framework, which raises investor protection issues.”  Ether holds support  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is holding support above the $3,000 breakout level that was achieved in August. ETH declined from the $4,000 resistance level as buyers were unable to match the all-time price high around $4,360 reached in May.  For now, ETH appears to be oversold on short-term charts, and will likely consolidate into the weekend.  Analysts are also monitoring price levels where future liquidations could occur. “We can view the updated positioning of where liquidation thresholds exist and how traders have repositioned themselves post-crash,” Luke Posey, researcher at Glassnode, wrote in a blog post.  “We see that the next round of significant liquidations don’t start until the ETH $2,600 level,” Posey wrote.  Coinbase exchange volumes rise  Trading volume on Coinbase has risen to the highest level since May as investors broaden their crypto exposure beyond bitcoin.  “Our expectation is for this trend to continue given the normally volatile September/October periods not just in crypto but in global markets as a whole,” Coinbase wrote in a report to institutional clients on Friday.  Bitcoin, ether and Cardano’s ADA continue to dominate trading volumes on the Coinbase exchange. Meanwhile, “retail’s obsession with DOGE seems to be over for now as relative volumes in it are fairly lackluster (dark blue in the upper half of the graph),” Coinbase wrote.  Algorand’s ALGO token also saw a significant uptick in trading volume recently. ALGO is up about 60% over the past week, compared to an 8% loss in BTC over the same period.  Altcoin roundup  Binance will support the Cardano hard fork scheduled for Sunday, Sept. 12: Cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced its support of Cardano’s hard fork, which will commence at approximately 21:44 UTC on Sunday. Deposits and withdrawal of ADA, the native token of Cardano, will be suspended at approximately 21:00 UTC and will be reopened once the exchange deems the upgraded network to be “stable.” The network upgrade is expected to bring smart-contract functionality to the Cardano mainnet, which is currently operating in a testnet environment. The exchange also noted that trading of ADA will not be affected.  Miami’s SCOPE Art Show is selling VIP tickets as NFTs: The art festival is working with YellowHeart, a blockchain-based live event ticketing platform, to sell tickets in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs have been a growing trend in the art and entertainment space by giving access to unique content and experiences and eliminating middlemen, according to CoinDesk’s Helene Braun.  Olympian Apolo Ohno is being sued over his role in an alleged $50M ICO fraud: Former speed skater Apolo Ohno is being sued over his role in the now-defunct crypto exchange HybridBlock, which raised an estimated $50 million from the sale of HYB tokens in 2017. The civil suit against HybridBlock comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to hunt down fraudsters that took advantage of the largely unregulated initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017 and 2018.

Disclosed in Friday regulatory filings, the raise, amassed from 107 investors, puts Pantera well short of a $600 million target projected in early May. Pantera began taking investments in July and is leaving the fund open “indefinitely,” meaning it could get there eventually.  The blockchain fund is meant to be Pantera’s omnibus crypto investment vehicle. It deploys into startup equity, early stage protocol tokens and more well-known digital assets, such as bitcoin, according to an investor deck.  Pantera held $4.7 billion in assets under management on Aug. 31, according to the deck.  The raise comes as other venture capital (VC) titans announce major funds for crypto investments. Top among them is Andreessen Horowitz’s (a16z) $2.2 billion fund, its third for crypto bets, that was announced in June.  Pantera did not reply to requests for comment by press time.  It’s been a banner year for crypto investments from the VC sector.

Berkovitz announced his departure on Thursday, noting he has worked with the CFTC, Congress and the private sector over the past 20 years on financial markets, including with the Dodd-Frank Act. He has served as a CFTC commissioner since September 2018.  In a statement, the regulator thanked his fellow commissioners, the CFTC staff he worked with and the lawmakers whose work involves the agency.  “As the CFTC gained responsibility over the swaps market, and new products like cryptocurrencies have emerged, the staff has worked diligently to expand its expertise and capabilities,” Berkovitz said. “Today, the CFTC is both a national and a global leader in financial market regulation. This well-deserved reputation is largely due to our talented staff.”  The regulator has warned in the past that certain products built on decentralized finance (DeFi) may violate federal laws, pointing to derivatives in particular.  “DeFi markets, platforms or websites are not registered as DCMs [derivatives contract markets] or SEFs [swap execution facilities]. The CEA [Commodities Exchange Act] does not contain any exception from registration for digital currencies, blockchains or smart contracts,” he said in a speech in June.  He has also warned that there are no federal consumer protection regulations around DeFi trading platforms, and a lack of intermediaries may mean that certain protections that exist in centralized markets just don’t exist with their DeFi counterparts.  Berkovitz will be the second CFTC Commissioner to step down in 45 days. Brian Quintenz, who served as a commissioner for four years, left the role in August. On Thursday, it was announced that Quintenz had taken on a part-time advisory role with the crypto division at Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm.  Former Chairman and Commissioner Heath Tarbert also left the agency earlier this year, after serving for two years.  With the departures, the CFTC is reduced to just two commissioners: Acting Chairman Rostin Behnam and Commissioner Dawn Stump.  President Joe Biden is reportedly considering Emory University Professor Kristin Johnson to fill at least one of the empty seats. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kent.) will likely also be able to nominate some individuals.

Indicators Might Show Today&apos;s Price Action Is Similar To That After $64.5k ATH As explained by a CryptoQuant analyst, there seem to be many similarities between the Bitcoin indicators of the post all-time-high (ATH) period and that of present day. There are three main metrics of relevance here. The first is the exchange reserve, which shows the amount of BTC currently being held on centralized exchange wallets. Here is how this indicator&apos;s value has changed during the past year: The BTC exchange reserve after the ATH vs today Looking at the above graph, there does seem to be a similarity between the two periods. Both had declining prices as well as declining exchange reserves. Next is the estimated leverage ratio, an indicator that shows how much leverage is used by traders on average. It&apos;s calculated by taking the open interest divided by the exchange reserve. The leverage ratio seems to be plunging down Here too a similarity can be seen as the indicator seems to have sharply dropped down during both present day and the post-ATH period.

NFTs have been a growing trend in the art and entertainment space, whether it’s to give access to unique content and experiences or eliminate middlemen.

42376301,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A5Lx,1631296839,Crypto Can Do Better Than ETFs,"In what is becoming a seasonal tradition, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is using any legal and technical recourse to punt yet again on approving U.S.-based crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Even with these challenges, several firms haven’t been deterred from attempting to become the first U.S operator in a global ETF market representing $6 trillion in assets under management (AUM).  We should not be that surprised by the SEC’s foot-dragging, considering the long and tortured financial history that got us to ETFs in the first place. It took around 450 years from the establishment of the first stock exchange in 16th century Antwerp until the first U.S. ETF was launched in 1993. It wasn’t until 1987′s Black Monday crash that the financial community faced a problem (see below) for which ETFs presented a sort of solution. Ever since, the instrument has often acted as a safe harbor in stormy financial climes, from the Great Recession of the late 2000s to pandemic-weary markets in the 2020s.  Jaime Rogozinski is the founder of WallStreetBets – a large online community that yields a commanding presence in the world of finance. Over the past 16 years, he has started multiple successful companies, mainly in tech and finance fields, that he has helped build from the ground up. His experience ranges from bootstrapped startups to multilateral banking.  Like the race to bring the first crypto ETF to the U.S., the first ETF itself was not created overnight. It took several attempts to craft those early ETFs, mainly due to prevailing securities, tax and corporate law regarding structured products, managed investment schemes, mutual funds and derivatives. Crypto ETFs don’t have nearly the same universal buy-in across the financial community, so it is no surprise this has been marked with even more false starts and stumbles. It is enough to make one wonder whether crypto ETFs will ever be universally accepted: They may be too risky for the old guard and too centralized for the new one.  Crypto ETFs: An old dog forced into new tricks  ETFs were created because investors wanted to achieve the same sort of return as a market index without having to hold the constituent assets of that index directly, essentially reproducing portfolio diversification, but at lower cost and with less effort. For its time, the ETF was a radical financial innovation that, at its heart, solved a most elementary problem for investors.  Now, in the nearly 30 years since the launch of that first ETF, there are over 150 ETF providers, a list that reads like a roll call of major institutional finance: Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, Invesco and VanEck.  For all of the benefits that traditional ETFs offer, like portfolio diversification and market performance, they do have some drawbacks, including the need for brokerage access that creates a whole litany of fees, illiquidity, trading delays tied to “market hours” and extra costs from the need for providers to maintain custody of the ETF’s underlying assets.  Now, 30 years after that first ETF, blockchain technology has literally rewritten the whole scene. Blockchain, cryptography and tokenization have made programmable finance accessible to all at the speed of the internet, creating whole currencies, derivatives and new financial industries out of decentralized consensus.  Now, what if you could take what was so attractive about ETFs 30 years ago and reconstruct that type of appeal for an entirely new world of financial options that we couldn’t even conceive of as little as 15 years ago?  It turns out we can.  Why ETF when you can ETP?  The powerful combination of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, on-chain asset management and smart contract technology is heralding the arrival of the decentralized version of ETFs, tokenized and fully collateralized baskets of digital assets called ETPs (exchange-traded portfolios).  These “baskets” are fully collateralized by the pooled assets that are held within the relevant smart contract. These “smart pools” can then be tokenized so investors can deposit funds into the smart contract, receiving a corresponding number of tokens that represent a given share in the underlying assets.  In addition, ETPs are non-custodial, meaning the investor remains in control of their deposited assets, and can withdraw them at any time by redeeming the corresponding tokens. Goodbye, brokerage fees and market hours.  Read more: Goldman Sachs Applies for DeFi ETF  As layer 2 blockchain protocols help reduce what have been the traditional gas fees associated with the deposit and withdrawal of smart contract funds, ETPs begin to look like very attractive products from a cost perspective. Even better, ETPs offer larger financial incentives: macro-hedges against inflation, participation in top crypto assets, pooled DeFi assets, baskets of traditional tech stocks, index-based portfolios and yield-bearing stablecoins.  ETFs have come a long way in the last 30 years, but trying to use that framework for crypto is a bit of a non-starter, even as tantalizing as it might be to some in the industry. With the advent of products that concentrate both investment and investment tools in crypto innovation – products like ETPs – investors will be able to participate in more opportunities offering better liquidity and less friction than ever.  For the old guard, it will require even more trust in a new paradigm that discards old inefficiencies. For the new guard, it will require even more imagination to not dress up tomorrow’s solutions in those same inefficiencies.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jaime Rogozinski,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/10/the-case-for-crypto-exchange-traded-portfolios-not-etfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5587a7d9e5ac425798beee5bf75dff5b8cb4a56-2400x1602.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Thursday, the department included the broker project in its annual “Priority Guidance Plan.” It is one of 193 projects now slated to receive additional resources through June 30, 2022.  The government mandate is reminiscent of last month’s infrastructure bill fracas that saw senators spar over the minutiae of crypto tech. Lawmakers’ failed effort to alter the bill’s definitions of a crypto broker put a national spotlight on the industry’s uneasy relationship with U.S. tax law.  However, the guidance plan, dated Sept. 9, is a separate effort from the congressional bill, on which the House of Representatives will vote at the end of the month.  Biden’s Treasury Department began campaigning for closer crypto monitoring months earlier. In late May, it rolled out a series of budget proposals that envisioned expanding crypto brokers’ information reporting requirements, a move it said would quash tax evasion.  The planned guidance is mum on specifics. It will apparently address “regulations regarding information reporting on virtual currency under § 6045.” That section of the U.S. Code deals with “Returns of brokers,” according to Cornell Law School.  The IRS deemed that issue a “tax administration” project. It also plans to issue “guidance concerning virtual currency” in an apparently separate effort in the “general tax issues” bucket.  “The published guidance process can be fully successful only if we have the benefit of the insight and experience of taxpayers and practitioners who must apply the rules,” the document said. “Therefore, we invite the public to continue to provide us with their comments and suggestions as we write guidance throughout the plan year.”  Bloomberg reported last month that the Treasury Department does not intend to broaden the definition of a broker beyond just trading platforms.

Sheila Warren and I get the lowdown from Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who among other roles is the co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus.  Have a listen after reading the newsletter.  Why crypto regulation needs fixing  After Coinbase complained Wednesday about the SEC’s threat to sue the crypto exchange company over its proposed stablecoin lending program, known as Lend, the Crypto Twitter lawyer community rose up, almost in unison, with a predictable refrain.  In essence: “This is clearly an unregistered security. You don’t understand the law. Be quiet.”  I’m starting to believe that, with the exception of a few crypto lawyers – see the newsletter’s “Conversation” section for examples – the legal profession, with its revolving door relationship with regulators, is the problem here. Because while a letter-of-the-law reading of the Howey Test says enabling holders of Circle’s USDC stablecoin to generate interest constitutes a security offering, it misses the point. And by point, I mean that enforcing outdated laws is counter to the public interest.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The Coinbase-SEC spat is a good example of why our financial regulatory system needs fixing.  It’s hard not to conclude that the existing suite of financial laws – laws that a divided, dysfunctional Congress seems unable to update for 21st century technological realities – serve only to protect the interests of Wall Street and wealthy investors, at the cost of the general public.  Worse, this stasis leads to a default position on macro and monetary policy that perpetuates the low-interest rate environment and deepens that divide.  Frustration is justified  Could Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who accused the SEC of “sketchy behavior” been a little more diplomatic? Perhaps. It’s not how most public companies address their regulator.  But there’s justification in the crypto community’s frequent frustration over a lack of clear guidance from the agency – along with that of SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who shared similar sentiments with me on CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin” show last week. There are real innovative opportunities within crypto to provide valuable, safe, useful products to savers, if only policymakers would devise an appropriate regulatory framework.  This is not to say there shouldn’t be rigorous regulation of centralized custodial entities such as Coinbase, which have fiduciary duties to their customers in ways that fully decentralized crypto projects do not. But using the blunt instrument of securities laws is counterproductive, especially when the crypto industry has tools for storing and trading assets that offer greater security and transparency than the heavily intermediated financial system for which those laws are mostly designed.  What we need is a visionary legislative overhaul. And for that we need Congress to recognize that crypto technology is inherently transformative and that, with the power of permissionless, open-source innovation, has the potential not only to spur economic growth and support U.S. technological leadership but – if, and only if, it is implemented and regulated properly – can foster financial inclusion and address economic imbalances.  Let’s listen to billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, who in a series of tweets Wednesday encouraged Coinbase to continue to “be aggressive in their engagement with the SEC” and argued that the crypto industry needs “exemptions like the internet got in the [1990s].”  The problem is that Congress is sadly short on visionaries. Yes, a growing list of U.S. lawmakers get the importance of this tech – listen to this week’s “Money Reimagined” podcast episode to hear from one, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.). But the dominant posture toward crypto on Capitol Hill is currently hostile.  Vocal, influential players like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are vociferously attacking the industry – seemingly unaware, or perhaps without caring, that she’s playing into the hands of the incumbent financial institutions she made a career out of fighting.  So, with comprehensive action in Congress difficult, the default response is what Cuban appropriately described as “regulation via litigation,” with inter-agency turf wars and power plays driving action rather than forward thinking.  Little guy loses  The upshot is that good faith technological alternatives to the costly traditional banking options are thwarted. Nowhere is this more relevant in the crypto lending and borrowing space.  Stablecoin lending offers a viable alternative to the anemic rates in traditional banking. Coinbase was offering 4% on USDC loans versus around 0.01% on most savings accounts. And whereas The New York Times last week said regulators viewed with “alarm” these offerings as a too-good-to-be-true “shadow banking,” the rate differentials are really the result of a differently structured risk management system.  Partly, the differential is possible because intermediary-free blockchain and smart-contract execution enables near real-time settlement of tokens and cuts out a lot of the hidden human and legal friction in the traditional credit business. The rest reflects the intense speculative activity in cryptocurrencies, which fuels constant short-term borrowing demand from both long- and short-position traders for whatever coins they are betting for or against in the spot or derivatives markets.  A regulator might say, “Well, there’s the problem: There’s too much speculation in crypto. We don’t want mom and pop’s money exposed to that volatility.” But the truth is that while there might be counterparty delivery risk if borrowed stablecoins are traded on poorly regulated exchanges (a risk Coinbase would mitigate through its borrower vetting process) the most solidly managed tokens, which includes USDC, are mostly devoid of price volatility.  Also, think about it: Why do people speculate on crypto? One reason: Many see an alternative to an expansive monetary system that’s paying zero rates, fueling inflation and driving an ever-growing divide between the privileged investors with access to surging financial assets and those that don’t.  If you cut off the latter group from offerings like Coinbase’s, all you’re left with are opportunities for the former – a group whose wealth meets “accredited investor” standards, ensuring providers can market offerings to them without SEC registration. The majority of Americans are left with zero-rate bank accounts. How is that in the public interest?",NEGATIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDC,Michael J.

42424582,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2usvh,1631293321,‘Wrong’ to Regulate Crypto Through Enforcement: Ex-CFTC Official Quintenz,"Yet another former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) official has said that setting regulation through enforcement is the wrong approach for the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry.  In an appearance on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” Friday, Brian Quintenz, who left the commodities watchdog just weeks ago and announced Thursday he has joined venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) as a part-time adviser, commented on the current regulatory action happening in the U.S. This includes the news another agency, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has threatened to sue Coinbase over a proposed lending product.  Deflating claims that the CFTC and its sister agency are engaged in a turf war, Quintenz said the federal agencies must work closely together to establish a comprehensive cryptocurrency framework.  “I don’t necessarily think applying 80-year-old laws to these kinds of dynamics are really the best way that the government can promote innovation, wealth creation and access to financial inclusion,” he said.  Quintenz is the latest former or current regulator to call for updating regulations. Policymakers are working to make sense of the crypto industry that, by design, overturns many established financial principles. This means fitting new tools into old paradigms, issuing guidance and, as what Quintenz hopes would be a last resort, establishing precedent through lawsuits.  In Coinbase’s case, the publicly traded exchange was reportedly in a dialogue with the SEC for months over what it was promoting as a savings account – offering 4% yields on USDC stablecoin deposits held with the exchange – before the agency threatened to sue. To the SEC the yet-to-be launched product looks more like a bond and thus a security, which is the regulator’s domain.  Read more: Giancarlo on Coinbase-SEC Clash: ‘Don’t Apply 90-Year-Old Statutes’  “Are those the laws that we would create now in response to any issues or problems or dynamics that currently exist? I would probably say no,” Quintenz said. He added that he is not a securities lawyer and does not know the particulars of the Coinbase case.  “We put forward guidance to try to provide clarity before we took an enforcement approach ... that’s the right way to look at innovation,” he said. “Setting policy through enforcement, in my view, is wrong.”  Guidance tells people what they can do, making it easier for them to know how to launch something compliantly, whereas enforcement only tells people what they cannot do, which does not help them be proactive about complying.  Sibling rivalry?  With the SEC having a crypto expert at the helm for the past few months, it appears the SEC and CFTC are fighting over turf. Last month, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that the vast majority of crypto assets would likely fall under the purview of his agency. Currently, only bitcoin and ether are decidedly commodities.  But Quintenz stressed the U.S. agencies have been working together for the benefit of the crypto industry and noted the personal relationships he forged with former SEC chief Joseph “Jay” Clayton and current Commissioner Hester Pierce.  “We’ve worked very constructively together to try to understand the innovation that was occurring in this space,” he said.  It’s up to incoming staff at the CFTC – there are now three senior vacancies for Congress to fill, Quintenz noted – to keep up this “coordination, communication and relationship” between the agencies and determine where their jurisdictions “overlap.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/10/wrong-to-regulate-crypto-through-enforcement-ex-cftc-official-quintenz,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d384109ff83008703163646ee291ee29ec085974-640x359.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a lawsuit filed Aug. 13, attorneys representing a handful of investors in HYB – the native token of HybridBlock, a now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange started in 2017 by Ohno and his business partner, Rod Jao – say their clients were the victims of a fraudulent scheme.  Brian Kang, a Los Angeles-based investor, poured nearly $1.5 million worth of ether into HYB. Other named plaintiffs, including Prasad Hurra, David Kim, David Kwon and Young Jae Kwon, each invested between $70,000 and $250,000 into the scheme.  The civil suit against HybridBlock comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to hunt down fraudsters that took advantage of the largely unregulated initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017 and 2018.  From January to June of 2018, Ohno and Jao promoted HybridBlock and its ICO on social media, at conferences, and in interviews, raising an estimated $50 million. But instead of their funds being used to build out the HybridBlock exchange and ecosystem as investors were led to believe, the complaint alleges the ICO was a “mere vessel for Defendants’ personal enrichment.”  Ohno, Jao and their associates are accused of funneling the money into personal accounts and business accounts belonging to Allysian, an unrelated supplement company also controlled by Jao and Ohno.  Farhad Novian and Alexander Gura, the Los Angeles-based attorneys for the plaintiffs, say that Ohno and Jao covered their tracks by claiming to be victims of a hack in August 2019.  According to the complaint, the purported hack was disputed by an electronic asset security company hired by HybridBlock after investors, including the plaintiffs, demanded to know where their money was. A report cited in the complaint detailed HybridBlock’s uncooperativeness during the investigation, including providing a “misleading incident report” and “failing to provide complete screenshots, chat logs and login histories of suspect accounts,” as well as its failure to notify investors or law enforcement of the breach.  After the alleged hack, Jao and Ohno are also accused of creating the Asia Digital Asset Exchange (ADAX) – described as an “automated liquidity protocol that facilitates trades within the Cardano ecosystem” – in May 2019 to acquire the failing HybridBlock and serve as an “exit vehicle” to funnel funds through to themselves.  Novian and Gura told CoinDesk in an interview they are still in the process of serving papers to the defendants, and have not yet made contact with their attorneys.

42421755,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpKBh,1631289930,Bukele’s MS-13 Double Bind,"Among the reactions to El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin as legal tender, which became official this week, has been concern about Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s relationship with the country’s violent gangs. Those gangs, including the California-bred group MS-13, have made El Salvador one of the most dangerous places in the world.  Bukele’s administration is known to have met with leaders of the dominant gangs, mostly in prisons, as documented by the Salvadoran news service El Faro. The Bukele administration officially denies the meetings, which has raised significant suspicion.  These meetings have often been loosely bundled with Bukele’s strong-arm legislative and judicial moves to characterize him, particularly in the international press, as corrupt and authoritarian. One looming worry based on this assessment is that the new Salvadoran bitcoin policy, particularly the national dollar-bitcoin exchange facility, could be abused by criminals via influence among national leaders, particularly for money laundering.  But this is at best a simplistic picture of Bukele’s relationship with the gangs, and quite likely simply inaccurate. Though there are many unknowns, there’s no clear evidence the Bukele administration, or its bitcoin policy, have been subverted by gang ties.  According to all available evidence, Bukele’s negotiations with gang leaders have involved giving them concessions, including increased prison privileges and limited amnesty for former members, in exchange for the bosses reducing murders across the country. The sub-rosa negotiations appear to have been successful, with the murder rate down by nearly half since Bukele took power in 2019 (though those numbers were already trending downwards).  According to Tiziano Breda, an analyst covering Central American conflicts for the think tank The Crisis Group, the negotiations are, if anything, less corrupt than those that led to a brief 2012 gang truce. That deal, under former President Mauricio Funes, allegedly included shuttling prostitutes into prisons and establishing “no go” zones for Salvadoran police.  The problem for Bukele is that negotiating with the gangs is viewed with suspicion by both the Salvadoran public and, it seems, the international community. Domestically, Bukele has officially denied negotiations and instead claimed the drop in murders is the result of a militarized “Iron Fist” approach to the gangs. That approach is much more popular with the Salvadoran public than any sort of negotiations, Breda told me – even though there’s no evidence that military force is an effective solution to the complex social and economic failures underpinning the gang situation.  Negotiations are certainly not what the international community wants, either; powerful global players benefit immensely from constant combat in Central America. Though Breda says Salvadoran gangs are not deeply involved in drug trafficking, the international stance towards the entire region has been shaped by U.S. drug war policies. Those have included billions of dollars in military spending for operations including the training of terrorist paramilitaries to undermine both drug cartels and left-wing governments.  Those plans have meant big bucks for American firms, even as they destabilized the region and significantly contributed to El Salvador’s decades of violence. So while we still have much to learn about Nayib Bukele, critics seeking to use his de-escalation policies against him deserve at least as much skepticism as he does.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,David Z.

42424592,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2utJh,1631288853,Former Crypto-Friendly Regulator Quintenz Joins VC Firm A16z,"Former crypto-friendly commodities regulator Brian Quintenz has joined venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) as a part-time adviser.  Announced Thursday, Quintenz becomes the latest high-profile addition to the firm, which has backed numerous projects in the tech and crypto industries. The prolific VC firm raised over $2 billion for its Crypto Fund III earlier this summer.  Quintenz said he was “thrilled” to join the company, saying the firm “has the acumen and pioneering vision” to build partnerships and drive a crypto revolution.  “The regulatory response to crypto innovation will be critical in whether an openly accessible, fully transparent, and decentralized value-creating financial ecosystem can be truly achieved. I’m excited to engage with both entrepreneurs and regulators to ensure that full potential can become a reality,” he said.  Quintenz, who stepped down from his role as one of the top officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) at the end of August, has long been a proponent of the crypto industry, suggesting that participants create self-regulatory organizations and sponsoring the agency’s Technology Advisory Committee during his tenure.  The regulator’s term officially expired in mid-2020, but government rules allowed him to stay on through the end of 2021.  Staffing up  A16z, which operates a number of dedicated crypto venture funds, has been rapidly expanding its team in recent months, particularly its crypto division. The firm has drawn from both the crypto industry as well as more traditional industries and government.  Quintenz joins the firm as the U.S. government ramps up its scrutiny of the still-growing crypto industry. The CFTC’s securities-focused counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has recently indicated a renewed focus on regulating or bringing enforcement actions against newer sectors of the industry such as decentralized finance (DeFi).  SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that U.S. regulators need more “plenary authority” to oversee trading, lending and DeFi platforms, citing a need for stronger investor protections.  Gensler has hinted that, in his view, all crypto trading platforms may need to fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction. Recent actions against Coinbase, of which a16z is a major backer, would seem to reflect that.  At present, there is no single federal regulator for spot crypto trading markets.  Quintenz has pushed back, tweeting that the SEC’s authority does not include commodities or commodity trading platforms, including crypto assets.

The SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) has been authorized by Swiss financial regulator FINMA to offer trading and custody of digital assets, according to an announcement Friday.  Having first announced it was building an exchange for digital assets based on blockchain technology in July 2018, SIX has been granted two licenses from FINMA to operate a stock exchange and central securities depository (CSD). It appears to be the first major stock exchange to be starting its own digital asset exchange.  “This is an important milestone in providing institutional investors with a safe and robust infrastructure meeting all of the core requirements of a traditional exchange and CSD infrastructure,” said Thomas Zeeb, SIX’s global head of exchanges and a member of its executive board.  It is not clear yet exactly which digital assets will be supported, though SIX’s initial announcement three years ago made reference to tokenizing traditional securities.  Having finally won FINMA approval, SDX will look to build the necessary ecosystem with liquidity for digital assets and onboard clients over the coming months.  SDX hopes to appeal to banks, issuers, insurance firms and institutional investors.

42424585,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ut3h,1631268600,BIS Signals Central Banks to Start Work on CBDCs,"The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) is signaling to central banks that they must prepare for the advent of central bank digital currencies (CBDC).  “Central bank money will have to evolve to be fit for the digital future,” Benoît Cœuré, head of the BIS Innovation Hub, said during a speech on Friday at the Eurofi Financial Forum in Ljubljana, Slovenia.  Cœuré dedicated his closing speech at the forum to discussing the role of central banks in the rollout of CBDCs and the challenges global stablecoins – cryptocurrencies linked to real world assets like the U.S. dollar – and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms will set for existing banking models.  “We should roll up our sleeves and accelerate our work on the nitty-gritty of CBDC design. CBDCs will take years to be rolled out, while stablecoins and crypto assets are already here. This makes it even more urgent to start,” Cœuré said.  The speech came just a week after BIS announced it was working with central banks in Singapore, South Africa, Australia and Malaysia to test the efficiency of CBDCs in cross-border payments. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) is preparing for a two-year investigation into a digital euro, set to kick off in October.  Crypto assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT) were also recognized as financial innovations that need deeper analysis and potential policy responses by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in its risk analysis report for 2021.  Cœuré said these new developments come with different regulatory questions that require “fast and consistent” answers. He added that, through all this, central banks still have a job to do: deliver price and financial stability.  “And they must retain their ability to do it,” Cœuré said  Stablecoins and DeFi  Cœuré's speech reinforced global regulators’ growing apprehension towards stablecoins and DeFi solutions.  According to ESMA’s risk report, regulators’ nervousness stems from the potential impact mass stablecoin adoption could have on existing financial systems, particularly in the wake of stablecoin issuer Tether revealing that almost half of its reserves were made up of unspecified commercial paper.  “Global stablecoins, DeFi platforms and big tech firms will challenge banks’ models,” Cœuré said.  Cœuré also said that central banks need to consider a number of implications including how public and private money should coexist in new ecosystems, and if central bank money, for instance, should be used in DeFi rather than private stablecoins.  “Stablecoins may develop as closed ecosystems or ‘walled gardens,’ creating fragmentation. With DeFi protocols, any concerns about the assets underlying stablecoins could see contagion spread through a system,” Cœuré said.  CBDCs are part of the solution to these concerns, he said, explaining that central banks must seriously consider consumer use cases, public policy objectives and technology when preparing to issue a digital currency.  A CBDC must meet expectations of users (in terms of usability and security), protect privacy and data, and improve financial inclusion among other things, Cœuré said. Central banks must also weigh different design choices that prioritize ease of use, low cost, convertibility, instant settlement and continuous availability along with resilience, flexibility and safety.  According to Cœuré, central banks around the world are coming together to work on CBDCs.  “A CBDC’s goal is ultimately to preserve the best elements of our current systems while still allowing a safe space for tomorrow’s innovation. To do so, central banks have to act while the current system is still in place – and to act now,” Cœuré said.

We expect Cardano to rise in the next 24-hours as the bulls prepare to spike above the intraday high at $2.63. The overall cryptocurrency market is trading with mixed signals, with Bitcoin almost flat with a measly gain of 0.68 percent and Ethereum losing approximately 1.67 percent. Traders are hoping the technical charts will recover as we enter into the weekend. The bulls are optimistic that more buyers will come in and be able to push the balance of power to their advantage. Cardano 24-hour price movement: Dropping market cap Cardano price analysis on the 24-hour chart indicates a daily trading range of $2.44 - $2.63. A pretty tight range suggests less volatility across the trading chart. The bulls are warming up for the Alonzo upgrade, which is set to launch on September 12, just two days from now. Cardano&apos;s daily trading volume witnessed a plummet on Thursday night by 29 percent to a total of $5.52 billion. The drop could be attributed to the bearish structure that engulfed the market between Wednesday and Thursday.

42424590,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2utBh,1631252331,European Finance Regulator Calls Crypto ‘Volatile’ but Innovative,"Crypto assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT) topped the European Securities and Markets Authority’s (ESMA) 2021 financial innovation scoreboard, according to a new report published by the institution.  The 110-page report, titled “Trends, Risks and Vulnerabilities,” treated cryptocurrency as a trending financial innovation as well as a threat to sustainable finance due to its “soaring” environmental cost, particularly in relation to crypto mining. The report suggested that crypto asset volatility, along with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and stablecoins, are contributing to increasing risk across all asset classes.  “Most crypto assets (CAs) are highly volatile in price and operate outside of the existing EU regulatory framework, which raises investor protection issues,” the report said.  ESMA is an independent European Union (EU) authority tasked with improving investor protection and promoting stable and orderly financial markets. The scoreboard prioritizes financial innovations that require deeper analysis and potential policy responses, and ranks them based on how they relate to ESMA objectives.  The ESMA report was released just as EU regulators began gearing up for the implementation of all-encompassing cryptocurrency regulations, new anti-money laundering (AML) rules and tax reporting requirements for virtual asset service providers and investors. Additionally, the European Central Bank (ECB) is set to begin a two-year investigation into a digital euro in October.  According to the report, a rise in risk-taking behavior and market exuberance are to blame for increasing volatility in equity markets.  “Increased [risk-taking] behavior has led to volatility in equity (e.g., GameStop-related market movements) and crypto asset markets, as well as to the materialization of event-driven risks such as in the case of Archegos or Greensill,” the report said, referring to the recent fall of New York investment giant Archegos, and London-based lender Greensill Capital.  Earlier this year, retail investors came together to rally behind GameStop stock, leading to massive losses for new traders as the price plummeted following initial hype of the movement.  “Going forward, we expect to continue to see a prolonged period of risk to institutional and retail investors of further – possibly significant – market corrections and see very high risks across the whole of the ESMA remit,” the report said.  The report cautions against the risks surrounding crypto assets, adding that the crypto market capitalization fell by almost 40% in May, highlighting their high price volatility.  The ultimate villain: Stablecoins  The report suggests that the EU’s upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework is designed to address these risks. The sweeping framework will apply in 27 member states, and includes particularly harsh restrictions on stablecoins (crypto backed by fiat reserves like the U.S. dollar), including requiring stablecoin issuers to own at least 3% of the coin’s reserves.  The report reiterates that stablecoins are not an EU favorite.  “Market developments around private stablecoins continue to be under scrutiny by global regulators, given the potential impact mass stablecoin adoption could have on financial systems. This call for more transparency and legal certainty has been reinforced as tether, the largest stablecoin, presented a breakdown of its reserves for the first time in May 2021,” the report said, referring to Tether revealing 49% of its reserves were made up of unspecified commercial paper.  The EU’s stance on stablecoins was made clearer when, just last week, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that in her view, stablecoins were pretending to be currencies, and that they are actually assets.  Environmental costs  According to the report, sustainable finance is expanding in Europe, with a 20% growth of environmental, social and governance (ESG) fund assets and a 40% rise in outstanding sustainable debt instruments in 2020.  But the energy consumption of certain DLT protocols is a source of environmental concern, the report said.  “Innovation can support sustainability by addressing ESG information gaps through Green financial technology (FinTech) solutions, but the environmental cost of one particular innovation – cryptocurrencies – is soaring,” the report said.  With mounting pressure on global leaders and institutions to up their game against climate change, cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin, have come under fire for the large amounts of energy required to mine and maintain their networks.  “Estimates vary but they agree that the carbon footprint of cryptocurrencies is far from negligible,” the report said. “These developments trigger discussions about possible regulatory responses to the unintended consequences of innovation, and in particular of crypto mining.”  Financial innovation  Alongside innovations like artificial intelligence and machine learning, the report emphasized the proliferation of distributed ledger technology (DLT), DeFi and CBDCs.  “DeFi holds the same benefits as blockchain technology on which it is built, namely disintermediation, round-the-clock availability and censorship resistance. It also faces similar challenges and risks, including in relation to operational resilience, scalability and governance,” the report said.  It goes on to say that CBDCs and stablecoin use combined with an increased interest in crypto assets from institutional investors are blurring the boundaries between centralized traditional financial systems and DeFi, and thereby “increasing the risks of potential spillover of DeFi risks to the real economy.”  “These risks are further intensified by the rapid growth of DeFi and the recent price performance of the main crypto assets,” the report said.  The growing risk to investors might be pushing regulators to step in throughout the EU, according to the report.  “Regulators’ engagement with FinTech through innovation hubs and regulatory sandboxes is becoming mainstream across the EU, with benefits for both parties,” the report said.  Fintech innovation hubs are working efficiently, the report suggests, adding that all member states have at least one hub set up. Regulatory sandboxes are less common, with eight currently operating in the EU, including in Denmark and the Netherlands.  “Both regulators and innovators increasingly recognize the benefits of innovation hubs and regulatory sandboxes, namely spurring innovation while staying alert to emerging risks,” the report said.  Aside from the risks involved, DLT has the potential to enhance efficiency in financial processes and firms while improving consumer outcomes, the report said, adding that applications are still limited.  “Scalability, interoperability and cyber-resilience will require monitoring as DLT develops. Other challenges include anonymity as well as governance and privacy issues,” the report said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/10/european-finance-regulator-calls-crypto-volatile-but-innovative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b51c82d21f65e6c4109bef232cb4b13997da52f6-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424584,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2usxh,1631249418,Bitcoin Coasts Long-Term Moving Average as Investor Holdings Increase,"Bitcoin is coasting on its road to recovery from Tuesday’s rocky sell-off that saw prices dip more than 18%.  The crypto is currently changing hands at around $46,840 after reaching a 24-hour top of $47,396, CoinDesk data shows. Bitcoin is up over 9% from the weekly low of $42,900 and over 61% in year-to-date terms.  “This week we saw one of crypto’s classic leverage shakeouts,” said Asher Tan, CEO of Australian cryptocurrency exchange CoinJar. “A quick 20%-30% haircut across the board as over-leveraged longs were flushed out of their positions.”  Prices have since bounced from bitcoin’s 200-day moving average (yellow line below) which has roughly acted as support around the $46,000 mark for almost three weeks, beginning Aug. 20.  “The market has stabilized after the large sell-off on Tuesday, said Jon de Wet, CIO at digital asset firm Zerocap. “Relative strength and other short-term oscillators are moving into oversold territory, and the bullish market structure is intact for the short term.”  While the drop took most people by surprise, the damage appears to have been limited to the derivative markets as long-term BTC holdings only increased during the downturn, Tan added.  Data by provider Glassnode shows wallet addresses holding 10 BTC rose by 154 from Tuesday’s dip to Friday. Smaller retail investors also increased their bitcoin holdings with wallet addresses containing exactly 1 BTC rising by 566 over the same period, including those holding 0.1 BTC or less. Wallet addresses containing 100 BTC or more fell sharply over the same time frame but could also be attributed to “short-term investors given the large wallet movements during the sell-off,” said de Wet.  Spent output ratios that look at profitability and losses taken over a particular time frame show long-term holders have largely maintained their positions indicating the larger wallet moves were on-balance active short-term traders.  Meanwhile, bullish daily spot exchange volume on Bitstamp rose to its highest point since Aug. 20, hinting at greater buying fervor around lower support levels and a temporary stay in short-term selling.  “We are seeing strong bids at these levels from the big players, which should buoy price coming into the weekend,” said de Wet.  Other notable cryptos in the top 20 by market capitalization were also trending in the green with DOT, LINK and AVAX clocking the highest gains over a 24-hour period.  “While bitcoin’s price is chopping around right now, the continued outperformance of certain altcoins – SOL and ALGO chief among of them – makes us cautiously hopeful that this is simply a speed bump on the path to higher prices,” Tan said.

JAX, one of the native tokens of the JaxNet protocol, performs the same function, but in an entirely different way. In our analysis of JAX coin versus stablecoins, we compare these approaches. What is JAX? JAX is a native token of the Jax.Network blockchain ecosystem. The coin is rewarded to miners as payment for mining on the shard chains of the network. These shard chains serve as the backbone of the network to ensure the network is secure and scalable at all times. As opposed to other blockchains, Jax.Network does not create an asset-pegged stablecoin. The exchange rate of JAX will float according to the market forces of demand and supply. Ultimately, JAX coins are underwritten by the electricity cost that is necessary to create them. The relatively stable cost of the electricity creates a lower bound below which miners cannot print these coins. Therefore, the value of JAX coins will remain stable without pegging them on any basket of stable real-world assets. JAX achieves stability by ensuring a proportionate reward for every miner based on the computing power they contribute to the entire network. There is an economic incentive for miners to mine the coin over shard chains, so mining JAX coins follow the law of supply and demand.

XLM/USD started off the 24 hours price analysis chart while buyers controlled the price.The MACD line has crossed over the red signal line implying the buyers have more strength than the sellers. Stellar price analysis: General price overview Stellar was trading in a bullish trend on yesterday&apos;s Stellar price analysis chart. However, this bullish trend was cut short by a firm selling pressure causing the prices to drop sharply to the lowest on the 5-day chart at $0.2661. The bulls could not let the bears cause another downtrend movement. So they gathered in large numbers and consolidated enough strength, and created a strong support that overturned the bearish trend, and the coin saw an upward momentum. On the five-day price analysis chart, Stellar trades in positive momentum, with the Bollinger bands widening in most trading sessions, indicating that the market has mild volatility. The RSI moved above the 70 mark on the first day, signaling that the buying pressure dominated the market. Things were different on the 7th as the Relative Strength Index favored the sellers, as it was ranging in the region between 0-30. The virtual currency heatmap shows a favorable market. Despite the heatmap being red in the early trading hours, most of the coins are now trading in bullish trends.
