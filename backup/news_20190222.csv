42381622,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nY3L,1550874754,CasperLabs Is Building a PoS Blockchain With Help from Ethereum's Vlad Zamfir,"A new startup called CasperLabs has launched with the aim of building a new blockchain based on a version of proof-of-stake (PoS), the experimental consensus protocol most associated with ethereum.  Ethereum Foundation researcher Vlad Zamfir will serve as lead consensus protocol architect of the company, confirming earlier reports of his association with the startup. Going forward, CasperLabs plans to sponsor much of Zamfir’s research on PoS so as to deploy a ""fully decentralized, sharded and scalable next-generation blockchain.""  Zamfir further told CoinDesk he would be tasked with ""producing protocol specifications"" in his new role that would ""support the [CasperLabs] team"" in understanding the eventual technology created. Zamfir will not be coding the blockchain itself, and will be helping strictly as a researcher.  One of a wide array of cryptocurrency consensus models designed to validate transactions without relying on proof-of-work mining (in which users solve computationally-intensive puzzles in order to append new blocks to the blockchain), PoS has arguably yet to see significant large-scale testing.  Within PoS, there are even competing designs for how to implement the idea, but the one designed by Zamfir in the early days of ethereum is called Casper Correct by Construction (CBC).  As stated in today's press release:  ""[Casper CBC] promises to scale the blockchain without sacrificing decentralization ... By removing the mining required by traditional proof-of-work protocols, it will be more ecologically and economically efficient and secure than pre-existing [blockchain] systems.""  Zamfir also spoke during the event today in New York commemorating the launch of the startup, alongside CEO of CasperLabs Medha Parlikar and lead developer Michael Birch.  While he did not address his involvement in the project directly, Zamfir spoke heavily about his research on the process of sharding – that is breaking up a distributed system into multiple different parts – in the context of a Casper CBC framework.  Casper CBC was developed in parallel with Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG) – which was created by founder of ethereum Vitalik Buterin and researcher Virgil Griffith. The two distinct PoS models draw heavily on much of the same pioneering research to do with validator reward staking and slashing conditions.  While both Casper CBC and FFG were discussed within the context of the roadmap for the ethereum blockchain, the broader community deemed Casper CBC a less production-ready version of PoS back in 2017 that could stand to wait until Casper FFG is fully implemented on ethereum.  Now, as development for Casper FFG continues on the ethereum blockchain, Zamfir will also be extending his research on Casper CBC, providing key analysis and review on various aspects of the CBC model including economics modalities, key parameters for configuration and more.  Zamfir said in today's press release: ""I'm excited that CasperLabs has taken an interest in implementing a scalable blockchain protocol from the CBC Casper family of protocols, and hope that their efforts are both independently successful and put pressure on other projects – like ethereum – to adopt the technology.""  CasperLabs is fully funded by parent company Adaptive Holdings, which is headed by CEO Mrinal Manohar.  As stated in a report about CasperLabs by crypto publication TheBlock, the startup has already received up to $20 million in verbal commitments by deep-pocketed investors such as the Galaxy and BlockTower. The company has yet to confirm any details about its funding.

42381630,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nYDP,1550846434,Hands-On Preview of Samsung's Galaxy S10 Phone Reveals New Crypto Details,"A hands-on preview of Samsung's just unveiled flagship phone, the Galaxy S10, reveals new details of the device's upcoming crypto features.  The first official specs of the phone were announced in the U.S. on Wednesday, but only brief mention was made of its ability to store cryptocurrency private keys.  However, in a piece for CoinDesk Korea, Park Geun-mo managed to review the device at Samsung's flagship D'light store in Seocho-Gu, Seoul, where the tech giant often first showcases its latest products.  Launching the ""Blockchain Keystore"" app on the S10 displays a screen that says ""Store your cryptocurrencies more securely,"" along with a description of what you can do with the app.  As the image above shows, it broadly allows three features: payments to merchants, digital signatures and crypto storage and transfers. The phone's full list of possible uses reads: secure distribution of data, insurance and contract verification, content copyright management, direct sharing of content, in-game goods ownership, digital asset management and transactions.  According to the app's terms and conditions, the Blockchain Keystore generates and stores a private key based on blockchain technology in a secure enclave built into the device. It can securely sign and store cryptocurrency transactions using blockchain.  The term ""devices"" refers to mobile devices developed by Samsung Electronics such as smart phones and tablets, according to the T&Cs.  Effectively, CoinDesk Korea writes, the firm looks to be saying that Blockchain Keystore will potentially be able to be installed on all mobile devices developed and sold by Samsung Electronics, and possibly notebooks too, in the long term.  The phone's T&Cs also state that third-party services provided by affiliates can also be used on the device and various blockchain-based decentralized applications (dapps) will eventually be able to be used on the Galaxy S10. Notably, the introduction video to the wallet provides a glimpse of a menu called ""Dapps"" (see bottom image) alongside the cryptocurrency wallet button.  Security features  When signing in to the Keystore for the first time, Samsung explains that the user's ""personal key"" is necessary to use various blockchain services, adding that it must be stored safely. The key in this case means a password.  Samsung has used its Knox service as the basis for integrated security management of mobile devices since 2013. Knox is a proven security service with the U.S. Department of Defense security certification and U.S. National Information Assurance Association CC certification (Common Criteria).  In addition, the Galaxy S10 series is equipped with an AP (Application Processor) Exynos 9820 developed by Samsung itself. The Exynos 9820 also includes a PUF (physically unclonable function) – a semiconductor-based cryptographic key management technology. In effect, the Galaxy S10 has plenty of security tech to store private keys safely.  The S10 allows users to store private keys either in the secure enclave or via a third-party service, the terms indicate.  But what do you do about your private keys if you lose your phone? According to the T&Cs, the private keys stored in the S10's Keystore are backed up in a personal account provided by Samsung. If the phone is lost or stolen, users can access the device and delete the private key through its Find My Mobile service. Further, if a private key is accidentally deleted, users can restore it via the service.  Centralizing key storage in this way is bound to raise questions about security and it remains to be seen what would happen if someone gained access to your Find My Mobile service and if Samsung might provide further protections.  Inside the wallet  In an introductory video at the D'light store, Samsung explained how to send funds through the wallet app.  First, after inputting the address, amount and fee to be sent and pressing the ""send"" button, users are prompted to confirm with fingerprint ID or PIN code.  Once the authentication is complete, the transfer is sent.  To save typing out long public cryptocurrency addresses and possibly making mistakes, wallet addresses can be entered using the camera to scan a QR code where available.  The wallet also provides the option to import an existing wallet and create a new wallet.  The app appears to support ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) by default, as there are logos for the two displayed in the Blockchain Keystore introduction image. Further, there is a cryptocurrency/token ""add"" button, so users will presumably be able to use other cryptocurrencies and ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens via the wallet.  Intriguingly, the Blockchain Keystore also provides hints about the possibility of connection to Samsung's payments platform Samsung Pay in the future. The terms and conditions explain that Samsung's Payments Service Group is responsible for inquiries about Blockchain Keystore payments.  Samsung said the Galaxy S10 will start shipping on March 8.

42381616,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nXzZ,1550837740,Thailand Green Lights Issuance and Trading of Blockchain Securities,"The Thai government is moving to allow blockchain-based securities to be issued and traded in the country.  According to a report from Bangkok Post on Friday, Thailand's National Legislative Assembly has approved an amendment to the Securities and Exchange Act legalizing the issuance of tokenized securities such as stocks and bonds.  As a result, the nation’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has amended the act – a change that will come into effect later this year. The SEC will reportedly issue detailed guidelines and rules for tokenized and electronic securities in the coming months.  SEC deputy secretary-general Tipsuda Thavaramara said in the article that the legislative effort clears the way for tokenisation platforms in the future, and will help develop the digital asset ecosystem.  The amendment will also allow businesses to be licensed to operate as depositories of securities and digital tokens. Previously this was business restricted to Thailand Securities Depository Co Ltd, a subsidiary of the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), the Bangkok Post said.  Crypto businesses in Thailand are regulated under the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses B.E. 2561 (2018).  Whether a security token offering will be regulated under the royal decree or the securities act will reportedly be decided by the SEC. It “will depend on features of rights and obligations associated with that token,” said Pariya Techamuanvivit, director of corporate communication department at the SEC, in Friday's report.  The Ministry of Finance already issues digital asset business licenses, awarding the license to four crypto firms and rejecting another two in January. The SET was reported to be planning to apply for a license from the ministry to operate a new digital assets exchange platform the same month.

42381628,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nYC9,1550835024,Bitcoin Remains On Hunt For $4.2K Despite Price Consolidation,"View  Bitcoin's low-volume price consolidation has taken the shape of a bull flag on the 4-hour chart. A break above $3,930 would confirm a flag breakout and open the doors to $4,330 (target as per the measured move method).  The flag breakout looks likely, as the longer duration charts are biased bullish: Monday’s high-volume triangle breakout is still valid, while a bullish crossover between the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) on the 3-day chart indicates a positive shift in market sentiment.  Another failure to take out $4,000 could yield a pullback to the 100-day moving average, currently lined up at $3,782.  Bitcoin's three-day price consolidation looks to be a bull breather before a continuation of the recent rally to above $4,000.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading largely unchanged on the day at $3,920 on Bitstamp. Notably, prices are trapped in a narrowing price of $4,000 to $3,860 for the third consecutive day.  As a result, traders may feel tempted to question the reliability of the high-volume triangle breakout, confirmed on Monday. The bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, will remain valid as long as prices are held above $3,614, as discussed yesterday.  Trading volumes have dropped 43 percent from the nine-month high of $9.93 billion seen on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap. So, the pullback from highs near $4,000 to $3,900 is likely nothing more than temporary bullish exhaustion.  Further, BTC seems to have created a bull flag pattern – a pause which often refreshes on the higher side – on the technical charts. Therefore, the cryptocurrency could soon pick up a strong bid and rise above $4,000.  4-hour chart  A 4-hour close above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $3,930, would confirm a bull flag breakout and open the doors to $4,330 (target as per the measured move method).  The RSI, currently at 63, is again reporting bullish conditions, as opposed to overbought readings seen three days ago.  Major averages – 50, 100 and 200 – are also trending north indicating a bullish setup.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, BTC has bounced upwards at the ascending 5-day moving average (MA), reinforcing the bullish view put forward by the short-term MA studies.  A high-volume break above $4,000 would bolster the already bullish technical setup and allow a rally to December highs above $4,200.  A less-likely close below Monday’s low of $3,614 would abort the bullish view.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42381609,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nXs1,1550829628,FBI Seeking Potential Victims of BitConnect to Assist Investigation,"If you invested in the proprietary token offered by the now-defunct crypto exchange BitConnect, the FBI wants to hear from you.  In a notice on its website Wednesday, the federal law enforcement agency said those who invested in the BitConnect coin (BCC) token can voluntarily reach out to the agency by filling out a questionnaire.  The FBI said investors’ responses would be “useful” as it investigates the case, and that it may reach out to respondents for additional information.  BitConnect closed down its crypto-lending platform in January 2018 following the issuance of cease-and-desist orders from Texas and North Carolina securities regulators, which claimed the company was engaging in an unregistered securities sale through its initial coin offering (ICO).  As a result, BitConnect’s BCC token plunged more than 90 percent, falling from over $400 to less than $20 in the first weeks of 2018. Crypto market data site CoinMarketCap now no longer lists the token.  The sudden loss in value led to several lawsuits seeking restitution for investors who saw their holdings become almost worthless, citing fraud and securities sale laws.  The FBI said in Wednesday’s statement:  “Bitconnect guaranteed investors up to a 10 percent total return per month on their investment, following a tiered-investment system based on the sum of an investor’s initial deposit.”  Back in March 2018, Trevon James, former BitConnect investor and promoter, said that the FBI was investigating the case and that he had spoken to the agency about the exchange and his involvement with the project.  “I’m glad that I don’t know anything, so that means there’s no proof that I knew anything,” James commented at the time.

42381618,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nY0p,1550826048,Andreas M. Antonopoulos Warns Against Ethereum In-Fighting,"The author of two widely acclaimed books on cryptocurrency offered advice to developers building ethereum, the world's second-largest blockchain, this weekend, arguing they should be careful to avoid fragmenting their technical community through infighting.  Andreas M. Antonopoulos  , whose books ""Mastering Bitcoin"" and ""Mastering Ethereum"" are now standards for developers learning both protocols, gave a keynote address about the importance of building “unstoppable code"" to hackers and enthusiasts at ETHDenver, a conference that drew thousands to Colorado to discuss the future of the protocol.  “Don’t give yourself the power to stop unstoppable code. Embrace the fact that what we’re doing is important and it requires courage,” he said onstage.  He added later in interview with CoinDesk, a word of caution to the ethereum community, saying:  “Be careful of fragmentation … When things get difficult, people become more insular in their thinking and they start magnifying differences instead of focussing on commonalities.”  Antonopoulos' remark went on to acknowledge the effects of market decline, in context of which ethereum's main cryptocurrency, ether, has dropped in value from $1,100 to just over $100. Speaking to CoinDesk, Antonopoulos argued that he expects depressed market conditions to add pressures to existing online debates.  “The really most extreme maximalism we’ve seen comes at the absolute peak of the bear market or the trough of the bear market when people are feeling very afraid and threatened,” said Antonopoulos.  He continued:  “When things are easy, it’s easy to get along. When things get hard, that’s when you need to stop and remember the things we share rather than the things that divide us.”  Antonopoulos  went on to call on others within the ethereum community to stand up in future instances in which those propelling the project forward are subjected to undue abuse.  “The bystander effect is very insidious, but it’s also very easy to beat and the way you beat it is by having one courageous person. That’s all it takes,” said Antonopoulos to CoinDesk.  Prophetic words  Antonopolous's words have taken on a new resonance, however, in light of the subsequent departure of ethereum core developer Afri Schoedon who quit the project this week over attacks launched against both himself personally and his work on the open-source software.  Schoedon’s decision to leave ethereum was spurred by an onslaught of criticism over a contentious tweet he made Thursday comparing ethereum to blockchain interoperability protocol Polkadot, which also has its own cryptocurrency.  Already, dozens of ethereum developers and contributors have published an open letter to signal an end to continued “toxic behaviour that discourages open discussion.”  The letter states:  ""We, the undersigned, contributors and workers behind scores of projects, and those seeking to build better systems, feel … threats against a person’s well-being can never be justified and we categorically reject such toxicity in digital communities.""  Further, voices in ethereum, including the community relations manager for it's leading non-profit, the Ethereum Foundation, have denounced the online abuse aimed at Schoedon.  Several other prominent members of the community on Twitter and Reddit have since spoken equally as adamantly about the need to call out and reject hateful commentary online.  Such actions are, in the viewpoint of Antonopoulos, exactly how real change can occur within communities – crypto or otherwise.  Antonopoulos concluded:  “Words change history … To me, part of empowering people is empowering them to be able to act with reason and logic and words, instead of with force, with coercion, with violence. And to also be able to defend themselves with reason and words in the face of coercion and violence.""  Andreas M.

According to a board of regents meeting agenda published on Tuesday, the university previously committed $3 million to Horowitz’s $300 million ""a16z Crypto"" fund in June 2018 and is now looking at follow-up investments. However, it did not disclose an exact amount.  The meeting agenda further added that ""as opportunities related to crypto networks transition from being undefined to becoming more visible and sharply defined, the need for a separate thematic fund may recede.”  Andreessen Horowitz launched a16z Crypto last year to focus on investing in cryptocurrency-related technology companies at different stages. The fund also reportedly attracted participation from Yale University.  Chris Dixon, Andreessen Horowitz's general partner, said at the time of the launch that it ""plans to invest consistently over time, regardless of market conditions,"" adding: ""If there is another ‘crypto winter,’ we’ll keep investing aggressively.”  Michigan’s endowment value climbed to about $12 billion last October. Its chief investment officer Erik Lundberg said at the time that the performance was “sufficient to sustain and grow the endowment in real terms, net of spending.""  Endowment and pension funds are increasingly starting to invest in the blockchain and crypto space. Just last week, two public pension funds – Fairfax County, Virginia’s Police Officer’s Retirement System, and Employees’ Retirement System – backed Morgan Creek Capital’s crypto-focused venture fund that raised $40 million.  Morgan Creek’s new fund also includes investments from a university endowment, a hospital system, an insurance company, and a private foundation, CoinDesk learned at the time.  Last week, Cambridge Associates, a pensions and endowments consultant, reportedly said that it’s time for institutional investors to consider getting into cryptocurrencies.

42381591,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nS0R,1550811650,Overstock CEO Predicts Late 2019 Boost in tZERO Token Trading,"Patrick Byrne, the CEO of Overstock, believes a market boom for its security trading platform tZERO lies just around the corner.  Speaking to CoinDesk in an interview Wednesday, Byrne said he expected volumes to soar after the year-long lock-up period for the tZERO Preferred (TZROP) token ends in August and the platform opens up to retail investors to register and trade. Right now, only accredited investors can do that.  So far, the daily volume on the platform has been fluctuating between 7,000 and 30,000 units of TZROP – the sole listed asset for now. At current prices, that amounts to less than $200,000 a day, hardly Nasdaq levels.  Still, Byrne is planning additional updates that will help boost liquidity on the exchange, first envisioned in 2014 as a kind of alternative stock market and now realized as an alternative trading (ATS) system for crypto tokens. Specifically, tZERO is also looking into getting more broker-dealers to work with, other than Dinosaur Financial Group, which is maintaining the trading exclusively now.  “I’m looking forward to you writing, ‘they’ve gone from 30,000 tokens to 300,000 tokens a day,'” Byrne told CoinDesk.  However, to introduce new broker-dealers, tZERO will have to get approvals for each one with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Byrne said, which could slow down the process.  Byrne told CoinDesk:  “FINRA and SEC made it clear that they want to see this work with one broker. We’re into an incremental disruption, not like you millennials that want everything burned down tomorrow.”  tZERO, the favorite child of Overstock and its subsidiary Medici (which owns 80 percent of tZERO), is led by former executives of the Overstock-Medici team: CEO Saum Noursalehi, who previously was the president of Overstock, and president Steven Hopkins, who used to be Medici’s general counsel and COO.  Medici's team in general is actively involved in helping the portfolio companies to strengthen the weak parts and lending its staff when needed, Byrne told CoinDesk. For example, Medici’s team of developers has been helping some startups with technical expertise, while different specialists helped build business operations, he noted.  “At Medici, there are different kinds of talent, and we’re pushing it to the companies as they need it,"" Byrne explained. ""A lot of these companies are young kids with an idea and maybe some money, but not much more. And they haven’t built a company: they don’t have lawyers, HR people, they might not even have senior engineers.""  But that's a challenge faced not only by Medici's holdings but by the industry this 57-year-old CEO has embraced. As he put it:  ""People in blockchain are used to building sort of little science experiments. They don’t know how to build something that a million of people are going to use.”  Stumbling blocks  In the meantime, two important deals that are supposed to boost tZERO and the entire Medici portfolio with cash seem to be stumbling so far.  The first one is the sale of the online retail business, Overstock.com, announced in November and expected to get finalizedby February. Asked if the process was advancing in any way, Byrne told CoinDesk that he’s “running the business as if I'm going to own it forever.”  Although “there is a process going on” regarding the projected sale, Byrne won’t say more but promises an optimistic future for the online retail business.  “We’re switching from the conventional internet strategy of growing and losing money, and we will have a positive cash flow in retail this year,” he said.  Another important deal for tZERO that seems as though it could be delayed is the one with the Hong-Kong-based firm GSR Capital that was going to invest up to $404 million in Overstock and tZERO, announced at the end of last year.  In December, GSR asked for an extension to close the deal, and the deadline was moved to Feb. 28. Asked about the status of the deal on the stage of the Oppenheimer Blockchain Summit in New York Wednesday, Byrne said that the two parties “have been staggering over the documents,” refusing to go into details.  Even if Overstock ends up keeping the retail business a little longer than expected, the company has already evolved into a blockchain play in investors' minds. Since Byrne became actively involved in the space a few years ago, Overstock's image has become closely connected to the cryptocurrency market, even though the company never announced large investments in crypto.  Overstock’s shares, which fell throughout 2018, followed the crypto bear market. Byrne says that according to the Overstock team's estimate, the price of the stock is now 87 percent correlated with the price of bitcoin.  “Clearly people are confused. We don’t own significant bitcoin,” he said.
