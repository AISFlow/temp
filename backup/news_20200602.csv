42404658,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdjvTg,1591135625,Minnesota Official Alarms Privacy Advocates With Contact Tracing Comments,"At a press conference Sunday, Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington compared the methods police were using to identify protestors to those used to track COVID-19 cases.      We’ve “begun analyzing the data of who we have arrested, and begun, actually, doing what you would think as almost pretty similar to our COVID [response]. It’s contact tracing. Who are they associated with? What platforms are they advocating for?” he said.      The Department of Public Safety works in partnership with local state and federal law enforcement and emergency response agencies.      Public health and privacy experts reacted with alarm, saying that conflating law enforcement and contact tracing could hamper COVID-19 tracing efforts by sowing distrust of the process as protests continue across the U.S.      “You need people to engage with contact tracing to save lives during an epidemic,” said Nigel Smart, a Belgian professor who has been a key figure in pushing Europe towards decentralized contact tracing protocols. He said that from a public policy point of view, the statement was both worrisome and shortsighted.      See also: As Pandemic Decimates Startups, Privacy Industry Holds Strong      “Making people think that contact tracing could also be used for political or law enforcement may make people less likely to engage with contact tracing during an epidemic. Which will then lead to unnecessary loss of life.”      This sentiment was echoed by Caitlin Rivers, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, which is closely tracking the spread of COVID-19 across the U.S.      “This is not contact tracing! What is described in the video is police work,” said Rivers in a tweet. “To see the two linked jeopardizes the credibility of public health, which needs community trust to work effectively.”      Protests over police brutality and the death of George Floyd have raged for days in Minneapolis and across the U.S. George Floyd was an African-American man who was killed by police when an officer kneeled on his neck and choked him for more than eight minutes. The incident was caught on video.    The real danger is that COVID tracing apps in the name of public health will be weaponized against dissidents, which is why we must support decentralized alternatives.    The U.S. does not have an official database for tracking police brutality. But according to the research group Mapping Police Violence, last year alone police killed more than 1,000 people, with black people disproportionately among those killed.      The concerns over undermining contact tracing efforts are exacerbated when black people are twice as likely to die from COVID-19 in America.      Contact tracing is the process of ascertaining whom people infected with COVID-19 might have come into contact with during the period in which they were contagious.      Governments, health experts and privacy advocates have been debating for weeks how invasive privacy-speaking contact tracing tech would need to be.      See also: COVID-19 Tracing Apps Have to Go Viral to Work. That’s a Big Ask      Adam Schwartz, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), was alarmed by law enforcement's suggestion that surveillance of protesters, and their beliefs and associations, is similar to contact tracing.      “Public health officials undertaking contact tracing must never share the personal information they collect with police, immigration enforcement agencies or intelligence officials,” said Schwartz.      “In fact, we need new legislation to guarantee this. Likewise, contact tracing should gather the least possible information, retain it for the shortest possible period of time and use it for nothing except contact tracing.”      Harry Halpin, a technologist and CEO of Nym, a privacy-tech startup, said the technique of contact tracing is the same whether it's detecting coronavirus spread or targetting political protesters in the U.S. supporting Black Lives Matter. But that underscores the need for systems that by design don’t allow information related to COVID-19 to be shared with law enforcement.      “The real danger is that COVID tracing apps in the name of public health will be weaponized against dissidents, which is why we must support decentralized alternatives,” said Halpin. “Overall, if possible always leave your phone at home, even at protests!”",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION | RESEARCH,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/02/minnesota-official-alarms-privacy-advocates-with-contact-tracing-comments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75fa2ce1480ddf023b305097d7533f37b36cd257-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Representative Mohammad Hossein Farhangi (Tabriz), speaking Tuesday before the nation’s parliament, called on the Governor of the Central Bank of Iran, Abdolnaser Hemmati, to handle oversight of bitcoin, according to the Tasnim news agency.      Calling proper management of bitcoin a “good opportunity for the country,” Farhangi warned against ceding its potential to financial institutions. ""Take the issue of bitcoin seriously,” he said.      Iran has been taking crypto seriously on several fronts. Parliament moved to enact restrictive currency smuggling laws in late May. Around that time, President Hassan Rouhani ordered his government to begin devising a national crypto mining strategy and accompanying regulatory regime. The Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade also licensed Iran's largest bitcoin mining operation in May.      But Farhangi, who sits on the Industries and Mines committee, thinks Iran’s mining hyperfocus leaves much to be desired in its treatment of cryptocurrencies.      “We do not understand that the government has entrusted the monitoring of bitcoins to the Ministry of Industry and Mines,” he said, “because the central bank must oversee digital currencies.”      Iran has been tiptoeing towards broader cryptocurrency adoption despite signals that the Central Bank might try to ban payment via bitcoin.

42432005,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8nFh,1591129310,"Market Wrap: Traders ‘Whack the Beehive’ as Bitcoin Surges, Then Plunges","Tuesday’s bitcoin price whipsaw can be partially explained by large traders looking to deleverage in the derivatives market.      Bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands around $9,512 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping less than 1% over the previous 24 hours.      A sudden rally to $10,000 late Monday boosted bullish sentiment as short sellers were squeezed on derivatives exchange BitMEX, the largest such event in eight months. Bitcoin traded as high as $10,430 on Coinbase. However, the market lost steam and bitcoin was then confined to a tight $10,000-$10,100 range for around 12 hours. Then, at 14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. ET) Tuesday, it suffered a drop of 8%, or $800, in less than five minutes.      “Today’s action is very fickle,” said Katie Stockton of Fairfield Strategies. Stockton still sees bullish momentum and expects bitcoin to approach highs not seen since last year. “Specifically, $10,055 is a retracement level that is the last major hurdle to the high from 2019 near $13,850,” she added.      Bitcoin’s sudden rise then fall was in part driven by liquidations on Seychelles-based derivatives exchange BitMEX. Over the past 24 hours, buy liquidations on BitMEX jumped during bitcoin’s price rise, then sell liquidations surged as the world’s oldest cryptocurrency dipped. Total buy liquidations over the past 24 hours were $131 million while sell liquidations were at $111 million.      Liquidations on BitMEX are the equivalent of margin calls on conventional exchanges. A “buy liquidation” on a bitcoin contract is when a losing short position is forced to close, requiring purchases of bitcoin. When a “sell liquidation” occurs, those long bitcoin are forced to sell.      One analyst has a term for the recent large movements. “It looks like a classic 'whack the beehive' trade,” said George Clayton, managing partner of alternative asset fund Cryptanalysis Capital.      Clayton suspects large spot traders are looking to liquidate BitMEX perpetual swaps that enable highly leveraged bets, up to 100x, on bitcoin’s price going up or down. “Big traders are looking for stops or perpetual liquidations,” he told CoinDesk.      In all, $242 million in liquidations occurred over the last 24 hours, over 70% of the $339 million in total BitMEX liquidations for the past week.      Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain Capital-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5, is concerned about massive amounts of leverage looming in crypto. However, he told CoinDesk, the recent bitcoin price moves still have futures in ""contango’"" a market condition considered bullish as futures are traded higher than spot prices. “Even after the roundtrip, we retain a contango in the curve,” he said.

42431996,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8mzh,1591128452,"Media Startup Civil Shuts Down, Team Absorbed Into Decentralized ID Efforts at ConsenSys","Blockchain journalism startup Civil is shutting down, with its team moving to the employ of parent company ConsenSys, Poynter reported Tuesday.      Co-founder Matthew Iles announced the shutdown in a blog post, writing, ""It's with a heavy heart that I announce the end of Civil."" Iles, who told CoinDesk he had no further comment after the publication of this article, wrote that the company, which had previously inked partnerships with Forbes and AP, had not been able to find a path to sustainability.      The startup sought to let readers directly support journalists, and help journalists collaborate to build their own publications, receiving $5 million from ConsenSys in 2017 to support this mission. However, it later failed to raise $8 million in a token sale, and had to refund investors the funds it did raise (ConsenSys was the largest backer of this token sale).      Civil tried again in February 2019, offering 34 million CVL tokens for sale.      Last year, the company finally began distributing token compensation packages to newsroom employees and Civil Media partners. Regarding these partners, Iles wrote that ""newsrooms on Civil have always operated independently, and therefore will remain unaffected.""      The Civil Registry, CVL tokens and other work products are open-source, and while they will remain available, the company will no longer develop or manage any of these projects. The Civil Foundation, which at one point was run by former NPR CEO Vivian Schiller and provided grants, support and educational tools to newsrooms, ""is effectively in hibernation,"" Iles wrote.      ""Civil was a great first step in realizing the promise of fully distributed blockchain technology as a safeguard of press freedom and speech rights. I'm very grateful to Matthew Iles, Joe Lubin and everyone at Civil and Consensys for starting so many great ideas rolling, and for founding so many great publications, Popula included,"" said Maria Bustillos, editor at Popula.      Popula received a grant from Civil, and used its tools and IPFS to store a news article on the Ethereum blockchain.      Civil's employees will now work on identity solutions for Ethereum, Iles said, building on work the team had already been conducting.      Civil began building decentralized identity and advertising products ""several months ago,"" which drew interest from enterprises, he said.      ""This pivot led to closer coordination with ConsenSys and the team building solutions for identity and provenance tracking, which in turn started conversations about a strategic merger,"" he wrote.      A ConsenSys spokesperson confirmed the move, telling CoinDesk that both the team and Civil's tech would be joining the Ethereum startup incubator.

42431993,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8mvh,1591115875,Blockchain Firms Flocked to Hong Kong in 2019: Report,"More blockchain companies set up shop in Hong Kong in 2019 than firms from any other fintech sub-sector, according to a report from the region’s Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau.      Representing 39% of the 57 fintechs that InvestHK, the government-owned inward investment advocate, wooed last year, blockchain outgrew the wealth tech, payments, cybersecurity, regulatory tech, credit tech and insurance tech sectors as Hong Kong’s foreign fintech relocation engine.      The growth figures depict a region savvily courting firms across the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Since 2018, authorities have offered immigration incentives to blockchain job seekers, launched a blockchain trade finance platform and brokered industry ties.      Those efforts appear to be paying off in more ways than one. Hong Kong had four times higher than average demand for blockchain professionals in a 2019 LinkedIn report, which ranked blockchain as the region’s top rising skill set.    Diversity in blockchain focus    Hong Kong’s heightened interest in blockchain jobs and firms spreads across the industry, the Treasury report shows.      Of 2019’s newcomer blockchain firms, 45% were enterprise blockchain companies, 27% built digital asset trading platforms, 14% were digital asset custodians and 9% focused on trade finance settlement.      An additional 5% were “exploring the area of security tokens” according to the Treasury report. That cautious wording may be a function of security tokens’ nascent regulatory status. Hong Kong’s financial regulator issued guidance on security tokens in March 2019 and rules for the exchanges that trade them in November.      See also: Hong Kong’s First Regulator-Approved Bitcoin Fund Targets $100M Raise      But the Securities and Futures Commission’s trading platform rules are only an “interim solution,” according to the report. It called for legislative action on the matter.      Blockchain firms represented 27% of InvestHK’s newcomer fintechs in 2018, the report said.      Hong Kong has continued to attract crypto ventures and investments in 2020, including capital from institutional players. In February, Fidelity International invested $14 million in the company running crypto exchange OSL, which is based in Hong Kong.      More growth is likely on the way.

The sell-off began at 14:45 UTC (10:45 a.m. ET) when the cryptocurrency was trading at highs above $10,137 and by 14:49 UTC, the price fell to $9,298. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,500, representing a 6.5% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. On BitMEX, prices were as low as $8,600.      The sudden price drop may have trapped many traders on the wrong side of the market. Moreover, the market was looking strong following Monday's convincing move above $10,000, and a few analysts were expecting bitcoin to continue rising toward $11,000.      However, buyers once again failed to keep prices above the $10,000 mark. The cryptocurrency has struggled multiple times over the past 12 months or so to establish a strong base above $10,000. The retreat, however, is unlikely to deter investors, who believe in bitcoin's long-term value as a safe haven asset and a hedge against inflation.      Moreover, ""HODLing"" sentiment has remained strong despite the unprecedented price volatility seen in the past five months. Nearly 60% of bitcoin’s supply hasn’t changed hands in over a year, a likely sign investors are holding in expectation of gains, according to Glassnode.

42432003,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8nDh,1591106429,Open Interest in Ether Options Hits Record High on Deribit,"Derivative contracts on ether are more popular than ever, as evidenced by record open positions in options listed on the Panama-based derivatives exchange Deribit.      Open interest, or the number of contracts outstanding and not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade, rose to a record high of $136 million on Monday, marking a 460% increase from $24 million seen on March 24, according to data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      In ETH terms, there were 547,000 option contracts open on Monday, a record high. Meanwhile. daily trading volume rose to a new lifetime high of $24 million on Monday, surpassing the previous record of $20 million reached two days before.      “We see increased interest in ETH options due to price performance since mid-March, [with] new firms entering the options space,” said Luuk Strijers, COO at Deribit.      Also read: Ether Leads Bitcoin on Price as Investors Prepare for Staking Arrival      Ether’s price rose by 55% and 12% in April and May, respectively, and was trading near $240 on Monday, representing a solid 166% gain from its March low of $90, according to CoinDesk’s data. The sharp rally looks to have revived institutional interest in ether’s options, which evaporated during March’s price crash.      Apart from the price rise, observers credit the upcoming transition from Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism to proof-of-work mechanism, dubbed Ethereum 2.0, for boosting activity in options.      “We also see an increase in over-the-counter (OTC) interest, resulting in dealers hedging on Deribit, possibly related to a shift in investor interest into ETH post-[Bitcoin] halving and with the upcoming ETH 2.0 launch,” said Strijers.      When an investor buys structured products over the counter, the dealer often hedges the exposure, at least partially, by buying or selling call or put options on exchanges. As a result, exchanges often register an increase in activity with the uptick in demand for OTC products. A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Meanwhile, a put option represents a right to sell.    Where the yields are    Ethereum’s switch to a staking model would allow ETH investors to earn a yield on their holdings. The prospect of earning extra ethers in return for holding existing coins in wallets to support the operations on a blockchain is already drawing investors to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value.      Ether’s price has gained a lead over bitcoin in the past few days. While bitcoin rallied by 8% last week, ether was up by over 15%, according to CoinDesk data.      The search for yield is also one of the main reasons for the growth in the crypto options market, according to Darius Sit, managing partner at Singapore-based QCP Capital. “More people are starting to realise the unique opportunity in crypto options for outsized returns and high yields with relatively low risk (if properly managed),” said Sit.      Crypto investors often lend their holdings to centralized exchanges and lending platforms for a fixed return. However, doing so takes up a significant amount of credit risk from their loans being hypothecated - a practice whereby banks and brokers use, for their own purposes, assets that have been posted as collateral by their clients.      “Capital is now beginning to shift away from lending and into options,” said Sit while adding that “this pattern would continue, especially with the negative interest rate environment across the globe.”    Investors selling puts?    Key option market metrics suggest investors are bullish on ether.      The put-call open interest ratio, which measures the number of put options open relative to calls, rose to a nine-month high of 0.93 on May 28, after having bottomed out at 0.40 in mid-March.      The uptick does not necessarily represent a build up of long put positions. In fact, the one-month put-call, which measures the price of puts relative to that of calls for options expiring in one month, is currently at -5.8%. The three-month and six-month gauges are also printing negative values.      The negative numbers indicate that put options are cheaper than calls. To put it another way, investors are looking to sell, or “write” puts, which is usually done when the market is expected to rise or trade in a sideways manner.    Futures register growth    Increased interest in ether derivatives aren’t limited to options on Deribit. Ether futures listed on major exchanges - BitMEX, FTX, Deribit, Kraken, OKEx, Bitfinex, Huobi, Bybit, Binance - have witnessed solid growth over the past two months alongside an uptick in prices and growth in the options market.      The aggregate daily open interest rose to $753 million on May 30 to hit the highest level since early March. As of Sunday, open interest was $740 million, up more than 100% from March lows.

42431988,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8mlh,1591104902,How a Fatal Weakness Forced Libra to Capitulate,"Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book, “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.      Libra was originally advertised as a revolutionary new payments system. By creating a totally new international currency, it would break down national payment barriers and enable the world’s unbanked to participate in the cashless economy, both locally and internationally. But the second edition of its white paper, released in April 2020, falls far short of this ambition. Instead of bypassing national currencies, it now embraces them. And the international currency, while not absent, has been downgraded to simply a basket of national currencies. Libra seems to have lost its soul.      Libra’s capitulation to government reminds me of the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel. A bunch of upstart humans challenged God (aka government) by building something that would, by reaching to heaven, threaten his authority. God had a look at what they were building and decided he didn’t like it. But he didn’t close down the Tower. He made it impossible for the humans to finish building it. Instead of a single language, the humans suddenly found themselves speaking multiple languages. Unable to understand each other anymore, they scattered across the world.      See also: Libra’s Long Road From a Facebook Lab to the Global Stage: A Timeline      Currency is similar to language. It enables humans to understand each other sufficiently to trade. Through trade, humans build social architectures. When there is a single currency that spans the globe, money flows freely across borders and national boundaries are weakened. The U.S. dollar currently acts as a single global currency. By doing so, it reinforces the global dominance of the United States. Libra’s proposal for a single global currency which was not the dollar or the euro but, crucially, was backed by them, could have left Western governments dancing to the tune of the Libra Association and its Reserve. It had to be stopped.      And stopped it has been. Indeed, it was always inevitable that it would be. Libra’s apparent power, underwritten by Facebook, concealed a fatal weakness. Unlike Bitcoin, which from the start aimed to create an alternative financial system independent of government, Libra’s architecture wholly depends on the existing fiat currency system – and on the whims of the governments that control it. Governments can’t shut down Bitcoin, or force it to change. But they could shut down Libra.      So Libra can only succeed if it becomes a quasi-government project. As the second whitepaper puts it, it is “a complement to, not a replacement for, domestic currencies.” And to achieve this, it must comply with government demands. To this end, the white paper makes four major changes.    If you really want to challenge government authority, you don’t tie yourself into the existing system.    Firstly, instead of a single global currency, there will be individual currency stablecoins. Each stablecoin will be 100% backed by reserves in its own currency. Minor currencies that aren’t represented in the reserve will have no stablecoins.      The international LBR coin will still be issued, but it will effectively become an index consisting of “some of” the national currencies in the reserve, with fixed weights reflecting the proportion of the reserves denominated in each currency. This seems to be stealing a march on the IMF’s SDR, which has made little progress towards becoming an international settlement currency.      The white paper cheerfully says that LBR “can be used as an efficient cross-border settlement coin as well as a neutral, low-volatility option for people and businesses in countries that do not have a single-currency stablecoin on the network yet.” Of course, the U.S. dollar is already a neutral, low-volatility option for people and businesses in countries that don’t have widely traded currencies. But it lacks an efficient cross-border settlement system.      See also: Frances Coppola - Bitcoin’s Halving Is Nothing Like Quantitative Tightening      The white paper says that if a country’s central bank issues its own digital currency (CBDC), it could be integrated into the Libra network. When this happens, the central bank for that currency will become the issuer of Libra’s stablecoin in that currency.Secondly, Libra will fully comply with KYC/AML and other laws and regulatory controls for individual currency stablecoins and, by extension, LBR itself. The second white paper says that people subject to sanctions, or living in jurisdictions subject to sanctions, won’t be able to use Libra:    Protocol-level controls will apply to all network participants, including Unhosted Wallets and VASPs, and automatically prevent transactions involving blockchain addresses identified by authorities as associated with sanctioned persons (sanctioned blockchain addresses). In addition, these controls can be used to restrict amounts stored in sanctioned blockchain addresses.  Sanctioned jurisdictions: Protocol-level controls will automatically prevent transactions originating from IP addresses associated with sanctioned jurisdictions.    Others, especially those who don’t have access to banks, will have restricted access to Libra, such as strict transaction and balance limits. Libra is clearly struggling to maintain its commitment to financial inclusion.      Thirdly, Libra has given up any idea of full decentralization, apparently because it might be possible for subversives to take over the system and remove the KYC/AML restrictions:    …a key concern expressed by regulators in a number of jurisdictions, including the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), is that it would be challenging for the Association to guarantee that the compliance provisions of the network would be maintained if it were to transition to a permissionless network where, for example, no due diligence is performed on validators.    Governments and their agents can’t bear to give up control. The price of getting a payments license from FINMA is abandoning any intention of becoming permissionless. The white paper claims permissionless aspects, like giving members the ability to compete for the right to run nodes and validate transactions. But this isn’t remotely similar to a permissionless network, such as Bitcoin. Association membership is decided by the Association. Who controls the Association?      See also: Leah Callon-Butler - To See Libra’s Potential, Look at the Philippines, Not the US      The final change prevents movements in the Libra Reserve from destabilizing fiat currencies. To be sure, since Libra’s entire architecture depends on the current system of fiat currencies remaining stable, it was surprising that the original white paper didn’t consider the effect of movements in the Libra Reserve on financial markets and governments. Or perhaps, the original writers just assumed that central banks would quietly backstop the Libra Reserve. Now, the backstop is explicit.      The Tower of Babel project is over. Libra will comply with everything that governments demand, and in return, it will be absorbed into the existing international financial system.      The lesson from Libra’s capitulation is that if you really want to challenge government authority, you don’t tie yourself into the existing system. You set up an alternative to it, and you defend it to the hilt.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/02/how-a-fatal-weakness-forced-libra-to-capitulate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3121fc04ba429d9f733ff95fe7d1d5fd01149667-1918x1078.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431992,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8mph,1591104832,"Crypto Criminals Have Already Stolen $1.4B in 2020, Says CipherTrace","It's been a billion-dollar springtime for cryptocurrency criminals, according to CipherTrace.      On Tuesday, the blockchain analytics firm said fraudsters, malicious hackers and thieves have amassed $1.36 billion in ill-gotten crypto through the first five months of 2020. CipherTrace published the findings in its June 2020 crypto anti-money laundering and crime report.      That hefty haul puts 2020 on track to become the second-costliest year in the history of crypto, behind 2019’s record $4.5 billion but likely ahead of 2018’s $1.7 billion, the firm estimates.      This year’s running total largely comes from a single fraud: Wotoken. The massive Chinese multi-level-marketing scheme stole $1.09 billion in 2018 and 2019, but only came to light last month. CipherTrace said Wotoken's funds – 46,000 bitcoin (BTC), 2.04 million ethereum (ETH), 292,000 litecoin (LTC), 56,000 bitcoin cash (BCH) and 684,000 EOS (EOS) – are still on the move.      “It was a classic pyramid scheme,” John Jefferies, chief financial analyst at CipherTrace, said. Claiming to have a “magic algorithm,” Wotoken grew and grew, passing 715,000 users, until Jefferies said it “collapsed under its own weight.” The scheme's alleged perpetrators are now on trial in China.      Wotoken underscores the continued rise of fraud as perhaps cryptocurrency’s biggest criminal threat, far bigger in stolen value than hacks and thefts, which account for just 2% of CipherTrace’s 2020 estimate. Last year also saw more lost in fraud than hacks.      See also: Illegal Miners in Russia Stole $6.6M Worth of Electricity, Power Grid Firm Says      What that trend means depends on how you look at it. Jefferies noted that it “demonstrates the maturing of the industry.” As more exchanges beef up their security systems, fewer hackers are getting through. (And some who do still give the money back).      But fraud highlights the need for closer regulation of cryptocurrency businesses, Jefferies said, adding: “If Wotoken was required to truly disclose beyond hyperbole how their thing worked,” it would have failed far faster.      “It’s not just protecting against counter terrorist financing or protecting against money laundering,” Jefferies said of crypto licensing regimes. “It's to protect uninformed consumers from themselves.”    Maturing criminals    Criminals are evolving their obfuscatory tactics. In a week of watching darknet wallets send crypto to exchanges, CipherTrace found over 30% of transfers took an interim step, while just under 10% of transfers went directly.      Those extra steps, while traceable, help mask the cryptocurrency's sources, and they raise the risk of an exchange inadvertently laundering criminal funds, CipherTrace said. Only 0.17% of illicit crypto that landed at exchanges got there directly in 2019.      Transfers from U.S.-based bitcoin ATMs to “high risk” exchanges continue to grow at an exponential rate. Last year 8% went right to shady crypto changers, while only 5% went to “regular” exchanges.      CipherTrace said that “high risk” exchanges are classified as such for their nefarious reputations. Even so, ATM transfers to such venues are not necessarily indicative of criminal behavior.    The Travel Rule    Crypto is a global industry and so, too, are its exchanges: 74% of exchange-to-exchange bitcoin transfers crossed international borders in 2019.      That could become a problem with the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) June 2020 deadline for crypto firms to begin collecting and sharing exchange users’ information.      See also: Crypto ‘Gray’ Markets Could Be Unintended Consequence of FATF Travel Rule      Jefferies said tech created to help exchanges comply with FATF's so-called Travel Rule is ready for implementation. However, the countries charged with enforcing the rule are not. Few jurisdictions are really ready, with full regulations in place, he said.      Jefferies predicted a future where bitcoin transfers only happen in “siloed environments” if the industry players and the countries they domicile in don’t get up to speed with the rule.      “It’s important to be able to maintain the value of cryptocurrency for international remittances,” he said.",NEGATIVE,BCH | ETH | LTC,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | LTC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/06/02/crypto-criminals-have-already-stolen-14b-in-2020-says-ciphertrace,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73e022d2754eb3bb29a1c7832b660218dfb30b33-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432002,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8nBh,1591102778,First Mover: BSV Doubles in 2020 as Bitcoin Offshoot Wins Devotees,"Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision, the controversial blockchain promoted by Craig Wright, is winning in digital-asset markets this year, with a token that has brought investors triple the returns of its better-known ancestor, bitcoin.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Bitcoin sv, or BSV as the token is known, has risen 96% so far in 2020, versus a 36% gain for bitcoin (as of Monday). It's also beating the 18% year-to-date return for bitcoin cash (BCH), another offshoot from bitcoin.      The project, which split off from bitcoin following a series of disputes in 2017 and 2018, has faced accusations in the past that its token's price is prone to manipulation. And Wright, who leads the BSV community through his software company nChain and claims to be bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, is embroiled in a lawsuit with his late business partner's estate. He was recently described as a “fraud” in a public message signed with bitcoin addresses he claims to own .      But some investors and developers say Bitcoin SV has technical advantages over bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that make it a worthy blockchain to build applications on. Those include Twetch, a social media platform based on Bitcoin SV that grabbed headlines last week when its Twitter account was briefly suspended; just hours before, the company had sent a tweet trolling Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey for fact-checking a post by President Donald Trump.      “We think this represents an incredible opportunity for anyone looking to buy in more cheaply to make a long-term investment on the only blockchain trying to scale and have mass adoption as a database,” Zach Resnick, managing partner of the money manager Unbounded Capital, wrote in an email. The firm invests in BSV tokens as well as projects focused on the blockchain.      It's been just over a year since the giant cryptocurrency exchange Binance delisted BSV, with CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao tweeting at the time that Wright was a “fraud” and that “the real Satoshi can digitally sign any message to prove it.” In an interview in October with the publication Coin Rivet, Wright called CZ a “lowlife. Not exactly taking the high road.      The driving force behind BSV’s split from bitcoin during the late 2010s was the idea that a blockchain should be “scalable” – that is, able to smoothly handle a sudden surge in usage, similar to the way the virtual-meeting platform Zoom suddenly on-boarded millions of new customers during the first few weeks of coronavirus-related lockdowns.      Bitcoin SV's backers say large data-block sizes, compared with those on the Bitcoin blockchain, could improve the network's scalability. Bitcoin SV pushed to increase block sizes to 132 megabytes, compared with 32 megabytes for BCH and one megabyte for Bitcoin. And in February, BSV implemented a system upgrade that removed the size limits and enabled scaling up to 2 gigabytes per block.      According to the data aggregator Coin.Dance, the Bitcoin SV blockchain’s daily average transaction throughput exceeds levels for both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.      Some Bitcoin SV critics say the data isn't what it seems.      Moe Adham, CEO of crypto ATM operator Bitaccess, told First Mover in a direct message that he suspects much of the network’s transaction volume is “spam.”      “No exchanges support it, no services support it,” Adham said. “The only activity I know of is people dumping BSV to get out.”      Trading the token carries risks, such as thin liquidity on exchanges. Despite the ejection from Binance, BSV does retain listings on the cryptocurrency exchanges Huobi, OKEx and Bitfinex. But daily trading volume on legitimate exchanges averages about $30 million, compared with close to $2 billion for bitcoin, according to Messari data.      Such risks don’t seem to deter developers choosing the platform. Calvin Ayre, an online casino billionaire who has brushed with U.S. law enforcement and whose business interests include BSV mining, says on his holding company’s website that the token is the “one and only bitcoin.”      Twetch founder Billy Rose said he likes the Bitcoin SV blockchain partly because the network can handle more than a million transactions in a single data block, versus about 3,500 transactions per block on the Bitcoin blockchain. That's key for the social-media platform because every post, like and reply on Twetch is archived on the blockchain, and each of those is essentially a microtransaction, according to Rose.      ""BSV enables these low-fee microtransactions and on-chain scaling,"" Rose told First Mover in an email.      Ryan X. Charles, the first cryptocurrency engineer hired at Reddit in 2014, told First Mover in a phone interview that BSV could be ideal for sending small amounts of value, known as micropayments, across the internet or on social media. Charles is the founder and CEO of Money Button, which can be used to send payments over the BSV blockchain.      “BSV has been making a steady gain this year due to adoption of real-world applications being deployed using the platform,” Jerry Chan, CEO of TAAL, which provides mining and software services for bitcoin SV, wrote in an email.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    Trend: Bitcoin has pulled back slightly from the overnight high of over $10,300, but remains safely in bullish territory.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $10,130, having hit a 3.5-month high during the late U.S. trading hours on Monday.      With a convincing move above $9,800, the cryptocurrency has broken out of a near month-long narrowing price range, as seen on the daily chart. Prices have now formed a pennant breakout, a bullish continuation pattern that often accelerates the preceding uptrend.      As such, stronger gains could be in the offing, more so, as both the daily and weekly chart relative strength indices (RSIs) are reporting bullish conditions with above-50 readings. The weekly MACD histogram, too, is signaling stronger upward momentum with higher bars above the zero line. And last but not the least, the daily chart shows a golden crossover, a long-term bull market indicator.      So, the charts look to have aligned in favor of stronger gains, possibly to $11,000 and higher. Popular analyst Josh Rager thinks the break above $10,000 is a positive development, but wants to see a daily close (UTC 00:00) above $10,370 before adopting an ultra-bullish stance.""Closing above $10,370 would be insanely bullish,"" tweeted Rager.

42431999,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8n7h,1591101589,BitMEX Sees Biggest Short Squeeze in 8 Months After Bitcoin Surge,"Bitcoin’s latest move above $10,000 looks to have nullified a significant amount of selling pressure building in the market.      The biggest cryptocurrency by market cap saw a bull breakout late on Monday, with the spot rise jumping from $9,440 to a 3.5-month high of $10,357, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      The price rise sparked more than $133 million worth of buy liquidations on crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX – the highest since October 26, according to data analytics firm Skew.      A buy liquidation is the forced closure of a short position – a bet that the price of the underlying will drop – when the spot price moves above a predetermined threshold and leads to the liquidation engine to square off or close the short positions.      Positions are covered by bitcoin being purchased by the open market. A pile of buy liquidations – such as the one on Monday night – can, therefore, cause a surge in demand for bitcoin and a price rise. This is sometimes referred to as a short squeeze.      In total, more than $430 million worth of bitcoin shorts were closed on BitMEX, as well as other platforms including Huobi Global, Binance, OKEx, and FTX      Looking at BitMEX's data, we can see that the majority of buy liquidations – $120 million out of a total of $133 million – happened in the final hour of the day, just after bitcoin moved above the $10,000 mark      “BTC has spent very little time above the $10,000 level in its history. In the last year, every time we have gone above $10,000 we haven't been able to hold the level for very long,” said Asim Ahmad, co-chief investment officer at London-based Eterna Capital. “The massive short squeeze indicates a lot of people didn't expect the cryptocurrency to test and breach the $10,000 level this quickly.""      The tide may now be turning in favor of the bulls. Bitcoin closed well above the May 7 high of $10,074 on Monday, establishing a bullish higher high and confirming a triangle breakout, a bullish continuation pattern on the daily chart.      The trendline is falling from July 2019 and February 2019 as highs was breached to the higher side over the course of the weekend.      “Psychologically both the $10,000 and the longer-term trendline on the daily chart that we'd failed to break several times have now become support levels,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank. “There's a little resistance around $10,500 then our next targets are 12,300 and 13,000.""      But Eterna Capital's Ahmad isn't so sure whether prices will keep their gains above $10,000, although he is bullish on the cryptocurrency over the long-term. ""This the first time since the halving and we expect this to change the dynamics over the longer term but it's hard to say if this is the moment we never see prices below $10k again,"" he said.

42431985,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8mdh,1591089711,Bitcoin Mining Pool Poolin Partners With BlockFi to Expand Crypto Lending Service,"Poolin, the second-largest bitcoin mining pool, is expanding its cryptocurrency lending and financial services businesses.      The pool announced Monday it has started working with U.S.-based crypto lender BlockFi, which will be acting like an interbank lender, providing a source of capital for Poolin.      The firm initially rolled out crypto lending offerings in February via its Singapore-registered wallet entity, Blockin. With more capital now available, Poolin will be able to extend the business to more miner customers, offering annualized interest at levels that can be below 6%.      Miners that connect to the pool currently have about 18.3 exahashes per second (EH/s) of combined computing power, accounting for roughly 20% of the Bitcoin network's total. That makes PoolIn the second-largest bitcoin mining pool, close behind F2Pool with around 19 EH/s of hashing power.      ""[A] mining pool is a traffic business and it is getting more and more competitive,"" said Yang Jianguo, head of Poolin's financial services. ""Poolin has its unique advantage but we also want multiple business lines – not just lending but also financial services – that are parallel to our pool business.""      Toward that end, the firm developed and launched its custodial Blockin wallet late last year. Poolin is the latest major bitcoin mining pool to have expanded into crypto lending products, despite a drop in demand after the major sell-off in March which force-liquidated the bitcoin collateral of many crypto miner operators in China.      Yang said, though, there is still demand from miners for loans originating from the need to pay for electricity or buying new mining equipment with bitcoin pledged as collateral. There's also a demand for options and derivative products.      The firm declined to disclose the current value of outstanding loans or how much it is borrowing from BlockFi.      The partnership also comes as BlockFi moves to extend credit to miners, as previously reported by CoinDesk.      Poolin said it's also considering accepting mining equipment as collateral, but acknowledged the valuation of such assets is not as definable as bitcoin.      CORRECTION (June 3, 17:40 UTC): A passage in a previous version of this article incorrectly paraphrased an earlier CoinDesk story.

42431991,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8mrh,1591084800,Bitcoiners Sprint to Improve Lightning Network in 2-Day Virtual Hackathon,"As coronavirus is changing everyone's lives, making it harder to go outside or interact with friends and family, people are leaning more than ever on digital video platforms to live a ""normal"" life. That includes Bitcoiners who are fine-tuning the organization of hackathons in the virtual realm.      Several times around the globe, German lightning research startup Fulmo has put on the event Lightning Hack Day, where developers gather to hack and share new exciting ideas to further the network or the lightning-related projects they've been working on.      With coronavirus making it unwise (and even legally restricted) to travel and gather in large groups in meat space, they've moved online, rebranding the event to the Hack Sprint. ""The world is still in lockdown, but that doesn't stop Bitcoiners to gather around the virtual fireplace to keep building and sharing knowledge!"" tweeted Fulmo a couple of weeks prior to the two-day event, which took place May 9 and 10.      The event is dedicated specifically to the lightning network, a technology considered critical to Bitcoin's future. It aims to solve huge problems with payments in the leaderless currency, such as significantly scaling how many transactions it can handle and speeding up payments to be instant, as shoppers expect.      Read more: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?      The hackathon is an ""unconference,"" since participants do much of the (self-)organization. They can get what they want out of it. Before the Hack Sprint, developers posted ""challenges"" for fellow hackers to solve, such as a small boost to lightning privacy and building an extension using lightning payments as a method to curb spam on a wiki, where participants can crowdsource information and collaboratively edit content. Some enthusiasts even posted BTC bounties to encourage participation.      ""Anyone is welcome to put up challenges and use the weekend to get some progress. No one is forced to deliver a prototype, but to work and share what their outcomes were,"" said Christian Rotzoll, DIY node project Raspiblitz creator and organizer of the Hack Sprint.      At the culmination of the 48-hour sprint, developers presented what they built or improved upon, a total of 16 projects, improving the sprawling lightning ecosystem in various ways – either adding new features or using the time to clean up messy code.    User-friendlier projects    Some projects focused on lightning applications like tipping. That’s a popular early application of the payment system, partly since lightning enables smaller online payments than ever before, with lower processing fees.      Many tipping apps are focused on media, including Tippin.me for Twitter, but developer Michael Bumann finished a proof of concept of such an app over the weekend geared towards donating to developers.      Programming might usually be a high-paying gig, but often developers create software for free to further a technology or cause that they're passionate about. The Bitcoin community, for example, is filled with these people.      Bumann created a tool to make it easier to automatically tip programmers (specifically the programming language Ruby) who developed open source software a developer used in their own project.      Read more: BitMEX Operator Ups Grant for Bitcoin Development to $100K      Teams made a number of improvements to Raspiblitz, a DIY guide for crafting your own lightning node with an interface showing some of the node statistics.      Running your own lightning node is the most trust-minimizing way of using Bitcoin, because you don't have to trust anyone else to tell you what the state of the blockchain is. Without one, a malicious actor could potentially feed a user false information.      Pseudonymous developer Openoms added a component to Raspiblitz to make it easier to summon the GUI of JoinMarket, one of a few key ways of making ""CoinJoin"" transactions, which gives users more privacy.      ""JoinMarket is the longest standing and most feature-rich CoinJoin software with somewhat less easy to use interface which I am determined to improve. This is a small step taken to make the existing graphical interface easily and safely available for RaspiBlitz users on their desktop,"" Openoms told CoinDesk.    Deeper improvements    Other developers focused on making lightning work better under the hood.      Again along the lines of privacy, one developer group created TOR2IP-Tunnelservice, which adds a new feature for lightning users taking advantage of Tor, a privacy tool that hides a user's IP address, which identifies a user's computer and location.      The tool uses lightning two ways in one. First, it allows a user to tie a public address to the Tor address where their lightning node is running and connected to, without revealing the identity or location of the node.      Read more: How a Coming Upgrade Could Improve Bitcoin Privacy and Scaling      Second of all, people can pay lightning to use this service.      Lightning developer Rene Pickhardt has been exploring the possibilities of using a different protocol for ""routing,"" which is how a payment moves to one person to another, producing a path that a payment moves through the network to reach its destination.      Pickhardt proposed a routing protocol just-in-time (JIT) for lightning for the past year, which potentially improves success rate and privacy of the network. For the hackathon, he and a PhD student Michael Ziegler put together a proof of concept, putting the idea into practice for the first time.      ""We finished one minute before 8 p.m."" – the time they were supposed to present, Pickhardt said with a laugh. (Especially uncanny since the protocol is called ""just in time."")      These are only a few of the projects that were presented at the hackathon. And not to mention, while this hackathon gives this lightning work more exposure, developers are actually working on these types of small improvements every day, attempting to build the future of online money.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/02/bitcoiners-sprint-to-improve-lightning-network-in-2-day-virtual-hackathon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b50359ed6144f01429023ccb15064b090d67fd3b-1106x836.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421877,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwmxJ,1591070125,bitcoin.com,"Bitcoin.com is a company and website dedicated to bitcoin cash and bitcoin core.  The website provides a variety of related services including a mobile wallet, a mining pool, cryptocurrency news and a crypto exchange among other features.  The domain and company are owned by Roger Ver and are registered in St. Kitts, in the Caribbean. Stephen Rust became the CEO of bitcoin.com in 2019, while Ver acts as the company’s executive chairman.  Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto said in a 2010 bitcointalk forum post that he was aware of the bitcoin.com domain when he was developing the project and that it was unrelated to his work.  Ver, an early industry investor, gained control of the domain in 2014 and leased it to China-based crypto exchange OKCoin in December of that year. The deal stipulated that OKCoin would redesign the site and that Ver would receive a portion of the site’s monthly revenue, the minimum amount of which was set at $10,000 per month.  However, in May 2015, OKCoin announced in a blog post that it would no longer manage the domain. The exchange cited a “contractual conflict” with Ver, and said that it could no longer make payments to him due to action that the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network had taken against Ripple Labs related to a transaction it had done with Ver.  More specifically, Ripple sold $250,000 worth of XRP to Ver, an investor in the company, despite the fact that he had a “three-count federal felony conviction for dealing in, mailing, and storing explosive devices and had been sentenced to prison.”  In the blog post, OKCoin also alleged that its original contract with Ver was not, in fact, an “official contract” because it did not “detail the legal entity with which Mr. Ver entered into a contractual agreement with.” OKCoin also said that its record of the contract differed from the contract that Ver held.  In 2016, bitcoin.com started their mining services and now offer multiple plans through their cloud mining contracts. They also offer a pool network for mining and hardware mining. In 2017, bitcoin.com released their wallet services, which supports both bitcoin cash and bitcoin. Wallet users are also able to purchase bitcoin and bitcoin cash using debit and credit cards.

As of 2020, Antpool represents over 12 percent of bitcoin’s network hash power. The mining pool launched in 2014 and is operated by mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain.  Antpool is an open access mining pool that supports ten cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum (ETH) and litecoin (LTC). The mining pool offers an app that monitors the hash rate of users’ miners in real-time, supports multi-coin mining and shared account management for convenience.  Earnings are calculated depending upon the amount of hash power a user contributes to Antpool and their selected ‘earnings mode.’ Antpool supports multiple earning modes, including Pay Per Share (PPS), Pay Per Last N Shares (PPLNS), Pay Per Share Plus Transaction Fee (PPS+) and SOLO.  PPS means a user’s earnings will be based on the amount of power their miner contributes minus a 2.5 percent fee. PPS+ is an added iteration to the original PPS method providing an additional allocation of transaction fees.

In March 2019, Bitmain launched Antpool Labs with the aim of providing services for small-cap cryptocurrency miners.

42431994,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN8mth,1591063088,'Financial Surveillance’ or ‘Blockchain Analysis’? Human Rights Foundation Debates Elliptic,"""I think you should quit your job and go and work for the good guys,"" the Human Rights Foundation's Alex Gladstein told Tom Robinson, the founder of crypto compliance firm Elliptic, Monday afternoon.      The two were debating blockchain surveillance as part of the Mainnet online event, sponsored by Messari, which opened today on the Hopin platform. Human Rights Foundation is an organization that focuses on working with activists around the world, especially in closed societies. Elliptic is a blockchain analytics company that helps enforcement-minded clients track the flow of crypto payments.      Robinson told Gladstein and the Messari audience that he founded Elliptic because he believed making cryptocurrency function in a way that was more amenable to regulators would enable more people to take advantage of cryptocurrency's advantages.      Robinson said he feared early on that bitcoin could be regulated out of existence. While he granted he didn't see a way for governments to destroy the network itself, he said, ""What you can do is shut down the pools of liquidity that make it useable.""      Compliance has been key to bitcoin's ascendance, he argued, as major companies providing services to bitcoin users have created robust departments for working with regulators. ""The reason that bitcoin has got to the scale it has,"" Robinson said, ""is because of the compliance policies that they have been put in place.""      Gladstein was very clear in his indictment of Elliptic, which raised $23 million last fall, and companies like it, including Chainalysis and CipherTrace.      ""The tools you're building regardless of your intentions will be used for policing bitcoin,"" Gladstein said. ""At the end of the day what you're doing is warrantless surveillance against people in other countries.    Both sides    Gladstein said making it easier to track what people do with bitcoin will have a chilling effect on the network. People will be more careful about what they use it for, knowing that there are entities out there that can trace transactions back to a crypto asset's acquisition.      That said, blockchain analysis was critical in enabling law enforcement to stop a large child pornography ring in October 2019, leading to the rescue of at least 23 minors. Nevertheless, crypto continues to pay for the sexual exploitation of children, with a market that grew to nearly $1 million in size last year, according to a report from Chainalysis.      Robinson defended the technology by saying that law enforcement could only use their tools to track a person to their identity if they had a warrant to do so. Nevertheless, he acknowledged his tools could also be used to help law enforcement identify sets of transactions that might be worth investigating.      Gladstein argued making tools that analyzed all bitcoin transactions made it easy for law enforcement to track even small payments, payments well below the size covered under the U.S.'s Bank Secrecy Act of 1970.      Robinson's main defense was that users had recourse to coin mixers, though he also noted any bitcoin that had gone through a coin mixer was likely to be flagged by an exchange. A recent report by Chainalysis, Elliptic's chief competitor, showed it is monitoring mixers but largely sees those coins being mixed for privacy purposes.      Gladstein predicted more advanced technologies would come along that would eventually render such firms useless, but right now the network is vulnerable to their surveillance and Gladstein repeatedly asked Elliptic to stop.      Robinson contended that the fact that criminals use bitcoin is a real problem for adoption, but Gladstein rejected Elliptic's solution. ""We can address those things through legitimate police work,"" Gladstein argued. Meanwhile, generalized financial surveillance ""creates a climate of fear,"" he said.      ""I would prefer you refer to yourself as a financial surveillance company not a blockchain analysis company. It's a euphemism,"" Gladstein said. ""You should join our side. It's just a much better way to sleep at night.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/02/financial-surveillance-or-blockchain-analysis-human-rights-foundation-debates-elliptic,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38d29d80f6fbb5c0f1a015094c7bd1950431463d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
