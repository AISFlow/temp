42425016,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlAPh,1373562096,Germany's Bitcoin.de and Fidor Bank AG form partnership,"German bitcoin marketplace bitcoin.de and Fidor Bank AG have formed a large-scale partnership, with the online bank agreeing to provide a 'liability umbrella' to the marketplace operator Bitcoin Deutschland GmbH.  This means the marketplace can prove it is officially following financial market regulations, such as anti-money laundering legislation.  ""With Fidor Bank AG as our partner, the digital bitcoin currency, which was initially smiled at as internet play money, is increasingly turning into a serious alternative currency after only four years,"" said Oliver Flaskämper, managing director of Bitcoin Deutchland GmbH.  ""In the context of this cooperation with Fidor Bank, in the weeks to come, our customers will be given the opportunity to trade on bitcoin.de in near real-time using a free FidorPay giro account,"" he added.  Darragh Browne, founder at Blockspin, which builds bitcoin start-ups, said UK bitcoin exchanges have experienced problems holding on to their bank accounts, mainly due to regulatory concerns of the banks. He said:  ""UK customers are waiting for somebody to get regulated with the FCA and form a good relationship with a bank. I know of various teams attempting to do this, hopefully at least one of them will succeed!""  He believes anything that makes it easier for customers to buy bitcoins in a safe way is a positive move as it ""adds liquidity to the bitcoin economy"".  ""The easier it is to access bitcoins, the more likely people will spend them. This benefits anybody who accepts bitcoins as payment.""  However, Browne concedes that some bitcoiners might be against bitcoin companies partnering with banks as they want the digital currency to grow as a closed-loop economy and have nothing to do with the existing financial system.  One of the key reasons many people turned to bitcoin in the first place was their strong dislike and distrust of banks, so these people will likely be against any partnerships with these institutions.  This isn't the first time we've seen a bitcoin company partner with a bank – back in December, French bitcoin exchange Bitcoin-Central forged a deal with payment processor Acoba and Credit Mutuel bank.  Things were hunky-dory for a few months, but then Bitcoin-Central was hacked and a few hundred bitcoins were stolen. The company stressed it would refund anyone who wanted to withdraw their money or bitcoins.  The company is currently working on tightening up security and hopes to re-launch soon.  ""We're planning on reopening a private beta for some of our previous customers by the end of next week, and if everything goes well we'll be open for the general public mid-August,"" said David Francois, CTO of Paymium, which operates Bitcoin-Central.  He explained it will still be partnered with the same bank, but the payment processor will be different:  ""The contract is signed, the technical integration is almost complete and we have a couple of original killer features brewing.""  In the meantime, bitcoin.de hopes to lead the way as an EU-regulated trading platform with an EU deposit guarantee (up to 100,000 EUR per customer).  Flaskämper believes the future is bright for bitcoin, but said it will still face some ups and downs.  ""The first speculative bubble occurred in 2011 at 20 EUR, the second in 2013 at 200 EUR. I do not think that any bitcoin investor would consider it a big problem if the next speculative bubble burst in 2015 at 2,000 EUR.  ""As early as in mid-2010, one of the developers of bitcoins, Gavin Andresen, predicted up to five speculative bubbles.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/11/germanys-bitcoinde-and-fidor-bank-ag-form-partnership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/902ff88d91d06d305c7150d0d84ce9e7adaeea93-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425027,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlAhh,1373552661,New company Krater offers rigs built with Avalon ASICs either from its stock or yours,"Krater  , a new bitcoin mining rig builder, is offering a clone of the Avalon ASIC mining rig. Krater says it has purchased 10,000 Avalon ASIC chips and plans to build (to order) rigs with up to 320 chips in each that could reach a theoretical high of 90 giga-hashes per second (Ghps). If you have already purchased some Avalon ASICs, Krater will still build the rig for you.  In its FAQ, Krater describes itself as:    We are just three normal guys from Ohio. Combined, we have corporate developer experience, small business ownership experience, and component level electronics.      We know there are plenty of people who are essentially scammers in the bitcoin community. We wanted to prove our concept before we introduced ourselves.    The design of the Krater Miner is a modified version of what Avalon already produces. As you can see, the prototype in the demonstration video below is built on a flat board. Fear not, though, Krater says the final model will be shipping a professionally made aluminium case.  As mentioned above, one interesting service offered by Krater is to take the chips you may already have and build a mining rig for you with the following parts:  Complete and fully functional Avalon cone  1000W Gold rated power supply  Five cooling fans  TP-Link router with CGminer  Professionally built aluminium case    The ASIC modules (i.e. printed circuit boards, PCBs) that Krater has designed for its mining rigs can take up to 80 Avalon ASICs each, and up to four modules can be fitted to a rig. Depending on the number of modules, a custom build will set you back between 60 BTC and 90 BTC. Bitcoin is the only accepted currency.  For 125 BTC, Krater will build a mining rig from scratch, from its own ASIC stock, fully decked out with 320 (that's four times 80 for those not keeping count) ASICs fitted, which should theoretically reach 90 Ghps.  http://vimeo.com/69971232  The company told us that it is now taking orders for its fully fitted model, of which they plan to build 31 units. Unlike other companies who can be difficult to communicate with, Krater has published an email address and telephone number on its website. What's more, the demonstration video features the guys responsible for the building work.  This may well engender some confidence in the customer service. However, the official Krater thread on the Bitcoin forum shows that many have been dissatisfied with the pricing of the units. Indeed, reading through the thread it appears that Krater had been asking 200 BTC for its mining rig. So the published price of 125 BTC represents a sizable reduction in price.  However, that 125 BTC price tag for a 90 Ghps miner is still quite hefty when weighed against the 72.36 BTC price offered by Avalon for its mining rig which promises a minimum of 63 Ghps. On the other hand, Avalon is not taking orders for its rig at the moment, whereas Krater is. Until proven otherwise, Krater has not had the same criticism that was levelled at Avalon for mining with equipment paid for by its customers, which may count towards its purported image of a genuine set of people.  There are still some unanswered questions as to Krater's stock of ASICs though. We do not know which batch of Avalon chips they come from (which may or may not matter to prospective miners). Furthermore, Krater's store page states: ""We are selling our 31 ""Krater Miner"" Avalon clones which we are building based on the 10,000 chips we ordered on May 2nd.""  This would seem to suggest that they do not yet have the chips, and so they are at the mercy of Avalon's supply chain.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/07/11/new-company-krater-offers-rigs-built-with-avalon-asics-either-from-its-stock-or-yours,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92145045a5cd69bebf25c30740941ca2e4474119-500x282.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425018,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlAVh,1373550823,CoinMade is a new bitcoin merchant directory by the CoinJar team,"The Australian team behind CoinJar, have launched a community site listing merchants who accept bitcoin as payment. The site, called CoinMade, is run as a service to the community and as such is free of any advertisements.  Being made by an Australian team, you will see plenty of links to Australian sellers, but the site is clearly global in its scope. The site does not accept orders, its modus operandi is simply to serve as a directory of what can be found elsewhere on the web.  There are plenty of categories to choose from. Everything from bitcoin tools and charities to toys and clothes.  Suggesting a site to be added is a straightforward process. Just click on the ""submit a new store"" link and fill in the form. When we tried submitting a site, we received a message that it would be posted to the site within two days, subject to review. However, to suggest a site, you'll have to create an account.  There are rules on what is and isn't acceptable though. CoinMade's about page cites the following rules:            We do not accept adult or gambling oriented entries.  We do not accept entries which deal illegal items.  We do not accept entries which deal in speculative or zero-sum financial products.  We do not use or accept affiliate links.  This site caters to an international audience; hence submissions should offer goods and services which can be received by international buyers. The following submissions are not presently being accepted:  Restaurants, cafes and food outlets.  Services which are location specific, e.g. medical, legal.      We do not accept entries which purely provide a payment gateway for Bitcoin without added layers or service.      We only accept English websites for now.        The Coinjar team said on Reddit that the site is still in beta and so ""things might break"", but the team wants as much feedback as it can get.  Ultimately, the CoinJar team hope that CoinMade will be community moderated. It is currently reviewing all submissions manually, but in its words ""we have our hands full"". Therefore, if you feel like contributing to the project, get in touch with the site via contact@coinmade.org.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/07/11/coinmade-is-a-new-bitcoin-merchant-directory-by-the-coinjar-team,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2cd7b1ecc671c0c7a8957a6c81e706e1038bdef-500x282.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425028,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlAlh,1373543858,Pirate Bay founder seeks bitcoin funding for encrypted messaging app Hemlis,"Bitcoiners are being asked to help fund the creation of Heml.is, an app that will allow people to send and receive messages safe in the knowledge they've not been read by anyone else.  Hemlis means ""secret"" in Swedish and the company's founders, Peter Sunde, Leif Högberg and Linus Olsson, believe secrets are something modern society is lacking in.  The Heml.is site states:    ""Private communication has more or less turned into an open stream for companies and governments to listen into.      Companies like Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Google have been forced to open up their systems and hand out information about their users. At the same time they have been forbidden to tell anyone about it!    We're building a message app where no one can listen in, not even us. We would rather close down the service before letting anyone in.""    Sunde, who was a co-founder of The Pirate Bay (a BitTorrent search engine), said he and his co-founders decided to set up Heml.is after Edward Snowden leaked details of US and British government mass surveillance programs to the press.  ""The NSA leaks have proven that companies based in the USA have no say in their own products and customers,"" he added.  The app, which will be available from the App Store and Google Play, is to use end-to-end encryption to ensure all messages sent are kept private.  Heml.is is currently asking for donations in bitcoins or via PayPal in order to fund the development of the app, plus the set-up and running of the required infrastructure.  ""We decided to offer bitcoin as a payment method purely because it's one of few methods that we call 'fräsigt' in Swedish – it's trusted, loved and decentralised, and we try to support it as much as possible,"" said Sunde.  Heml.is is likely to come up against the same argument often used against bitcoin – increasing privacy will allow criminals to operate freely. Sunde has already thought of this, though, and had this to say in response: ""Compare it to whispering something to a friend – it could be illegal, but it's probably not. We need to be able to talk to people, it's a human right.""  Since the Heml.is website launched two days ago, it has received over $115,300 in donations from more than 7,600 people, exceeding its $100,000 goal.  Sunde told CoinDesk that, if all goes well, the Heml.is app could go on to be used to securely and privately transfer bitcoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/11/pirate-bay-founder-seeks-bitcoin-funding-for-encrypted-messaging-app-hemlis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf1761015f812a9b1d599958ff06b798a45c69d5-1000x451.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425024,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHlAdh,1373539915,Football teams fundraise using bitcoin,"Two football teams in the south-west English town of Chard have chosen bitcoin as their preferred funding method as they raise money for new facilities.  Chard United and Chard Rangers are currently fundraising so they can build changing rooms at Jocelyn Park – the ground the two teams share. Currently, the teams have to change at a cricket ground that is a 20-minute walk away.  ""They've been fighting for the local town council for 15 years to try and convince them to build changing facilities at Jocelyn Park, but the council are not really football fans, so have said no pretty much every time,"" said a local businessman and bitcoin advocate who donated 150 bitcoins to the fund.  The council recently agreed to give planning permission for the teams to build temporary changing facilities, but said it would not pay for the construction work.  When Chard United was fundraising in a local pub, one punter asked whether they had considered fundraising in bitcoin.  ""Every single player on the team is now a bitcoin nut – they're all using it and they've had a site designed where they've got a whole page devoted to bitcoin, explaining what it is and why people should use it. They've also got Bitcoin branding on all of their merchandise and shirts,"" the local businessman said.  One shirt displayed on the Chard United FC website has the name Satoshi on the back, with another reading Bernanke and a third reading Shrem after Charlie Shrem of BitInstant.  Our source said the team members are doing a lot to spread the word about bitcoin wherever they go and he hopes the rest of the bitcoin community will pitch in and help them reach their goal of £25,000.  Steve Scriven, secretary at Chard United, said: ""This is a huge step for the club. This is something we have been looking to do for 15 years now and with great help and support from all at Chard United, The Happy Return, Chard Rangers, members of the council and now … the Bitcoin community, it finally looks as if this can happen.""  He hopes the fundraising goal will be reached by mid-August, so the teams would have their new facilities shortly after the start of the football season.  The businessman we spoke to said he's hoping stories such as this will start to change the negative view a lot of people have about bitcoin and other digital currencies.  ""I'm hoping this will change the opinion of those people who think all bitcoin is used for is to go online and buy drugs. It's very frustrating for people in the industry to keep hearing about Silk Road when it's just one website and doesn't really do justice to what bitcoin is.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/11/football-teams-fundraise-using-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6aa3e43034c57c7e81f509ba46474390efd4173-577x300.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
