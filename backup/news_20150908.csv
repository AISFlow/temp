42378323,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7foD9,1441751263,Blockchain Ideas Explored at Consensus Makeathon Day One,"Day one of the Consensus 2015 Makeathon brought together more than 60 developers, industry experts and students with the goal of developing new solutions using blockchain tech.  Held at New York-based co-working space General Assembly and sponsored by Braintree, Chain, Coinbase and KeepKey, the two-day event involves 16 teams competing to win $5,000 in cash or a digital currency of their choosing.  The teams are focused on solutions for financial inclusion or financial infrastructure, with interesting early solutions emerging. At the end of the morning's brainstorming session, teams had already committed to work projects as diverse as an open accounting protocol and microlending solutions for rural communities.  As explained by Citi senior vice president Ian Lee, the makeathon intends to explore areas of the technology that haven't yet been developed by startups.  Lee said:  ""A lot of startups have focused on remittances but there have been more than a dozen trying to do it, but there's services - credit, lending - in emerging markets that have yet to be explored.""  ""We're hoping people will come up with creative and new ideas beyond core payments and settlement,"" he added.  Elsewhere, makeathon mentors were on hand to help teams move their ideas from concepts to prototype stage for presentation at tomorrow's final day. Mentors including Skuchain CEO Srinivasan Sriram and Bitspark COO Maxine Ryan suggested that their goal was to expose teams to their respective APIs and solutions, while also helping them move past the challenges that can crop up during the process.  ""One of the biggest things that people have asked me is 'How does [the technology] work?'"" Ryan told CoinDesk. ""But, they're also looking at how you can build a product for someone in the third world or an emerging market.""  Final presentations will be judged on the relative newness of the idea, how impactful the solution could be and whether the idea necessitates the use of a blockchain, among other factors.  Teams will follow the venture design program developed by makeathon partner IDEO Futures, which aims to encourage participants to think of the business model and brand that could emerge from their prototype.  ""We believe in thinking about ventures from the get go,"" IDEO portfolio director and business designer Matt Weiss told attendees. ""You should be thinking about the organizational structure and brand at the center, as well as who you're designing it for.""  Though the verdict is still out on the proposed ideas, day one of the event was able to bring together a diverse set of participants.  Consensus 2015  is a one-day flagship conference organized by CoinDesk.  Startup founders  One notable contingent at the event were founders of early-stage projects in the bitcoin space.  Pierre Gerard, founder of blockchain-based compliance management startup ScoreChain, for example, said he chose to attend the makeathon to share ideas and learn from professionals with diverse backgrounds.  ""Bitcoin needs to reach out to people who don't know much about bitcoin, so it's great to connect with people outside the bitcoin ecosystem,"" Gerard told CoinDesk.  Mario Salazar, founder of blockchain-based resource management network Akiles Coinhttp://www.blockfinity.com/, was another startup veteran seeking to extend his expertise, though his intent in attending was more focused on highlighting his personal and professional passions.  ""My area of expertise the financial situation in Puerto Rico, nobody is bringing anything and I want to be the first one to bring this to the table. It's cool that I was able to bring my concept and now I've got coders working on it,"" Salazar said.  For the makeathon, Gerard's team is working on a peer-to-peer (P2P) credit scoring system, while Salazar's is more focused on resource management.  Students and graduates  Some of the more tech-focused participants at the event were students seeking to explore the technology as a means to improve their skills for potential employers.  Charles Crain, a recent University of California Santa Barbara graduate, has recently been attending hackathons to explore how his experience in building applications could be applied to projects such as bitcoin and decentralized application platform Ethereum.  ""I took a distributed systems class in college and I learned about this idea of the blockchain as this huge consensus network, I was like, 'Whoa this is crazy. How did someone come up with this?'"" Crain recalled.  Deepak Atal, a New York University computer science major, however, was new to the hackathon circuit, this being the first time he's attended such an event.  ""I wanted to explore the field of bitcoin and wanted to start here in a place to know about these things to meet experts,"" he said, adding that his team is seeking to apply blockchain solutions to the mortgage industry.  One of the more passionate attendees was Vermont Law School's Melissa Kent who is seeking to understand applications of blockchain technology in the legal field.  ""I know that there is a lot of different types of confidentiality issues that can be solved by using the blockchain,"" she said. ""For instance, I can have a PGP key and communicate privately with my client and encrypt that and use the blockchain to help me keep all that information private.""  Kent's team is now working directly on these concepts.  Financial professionals  Equally present at the event were members of traditional financial institutions including Citi and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  Thulasi Janardhanan, an associate at Citi's Portfolio Risk Management division, came to the makeathon to ""see what people are talking about"" in regards to the new technology.  ""If you bring a group of people together, I would think they can come up with brilliant solutions,"" Janardhanan said, adding that makeathon environments can offer an alternative from the siloed structure of traditional banks.  Members of the bitcoin industry were also present, with some like Tembusu chief cryptographer Pavel Kravchenko and developer Oscar Guindzberg, coming from as far away as Ukraine and Argentina to attend.

42378314,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fo4L,1441744434,Former US Advisor: Blockchain Systems Could Threaten Privacy,"A long-time White House advisor and government official believes blockchain technology is likely to be used by the world’s central banks to create a ""universal cashless system"".  Dr Harald Malmgren  served in the administrations of Presidents John F Kennedy, Lyndon B Johnson, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, working as a trade negotiator and policy researcher, and for decades played a part in shaping US foreign policy in the post-World War II era. Malmgren today acts as a consultant for companies and governments on international trade issues.  In a recent interview published on Zero Hedge, Malmgren touched on the policy push by many governments worldwide to move transactional systems from those dominated by cash to those comprised of digital, trackable transactions. In his view, central banks, private companies and governments desire such systems because of the data that would be accessible to them.  He cites blockchain technology as a major technological aspect of this drive, citing the work of Blythe Masters and her blockchain startup, Digital Asset Holdings (DAH), in developing such systems.  Malmgren told Sinclair & Co's Erico Matias Tavares:  ""The people now intensively working on a mechanism for a cashless society are building it around the concept of blockchain technology. In essence, there would be a single ledger that records each expenditure or revenue event (the block), linking them chronologically with every other subsequent purchase, sale, or revenue event in a recorded chain.""  Such an arrangement, he continued, would give rise to an environment in which ""significant financial flows and all debts and assets could be monitored in real time, enabling policies and regulations to be adapted to the realities of daily life"".  This, he asserted, was at the heart of the work of DAH.  ""The objective of the blockchain that Blythe Masters is pursuing is ultimately to put together a global blockchain, which is consolidated at any moment in time. Everything you have and everything you owe are visible,"" he stated.  Privacy risks  For Malmgren, the creation of a universal cashless system carries significant risks. Beyond fears related to data privacy, a no-cash framework could lend itself to sociological governance whereby regulators start trying to oversee daily activities more actively.  ""If your funds are being used in a statistically abnormal manner then they can start routinely asking you for an explanation, if it was drug money or money laundering or purchases of regulated products like alcoholic beverages or firearms,"" he said.  If used in that fashion, Malmgren noted, the blockchain would help create an environment in which regulators have vast troves of data with which to monitor, categorize and regulate spenders. This system, he argues, would also enable more direct financial engineering as central bankers saw fit.  ""A complete ledger system would place everyone inside a precisely defined, monitorable box with defined set of rules of behavior,"" he said.  Malmgren continued:  “If local or national governments found themselves in financial crisis, they would not be limited to European style bail-ins of savings accounts. They could tap personal or family assets directly through the ledger system. Your balance could be altered by government simply by adding one new block to a long chain.”  ""One can understand the benefits, but there are potential negative consequences for individuals and businesses,"" he concluded. ""And the Social Contract between citizens and their governments would be threatened.""

At a strategy briefing in Sydney yesterday, Brian Hartzer said the future of the technology – which has a number of ""limitations"" – is currently uncertain, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.  He added:  ""I think it is a bit too soon to panic about it. It is potentially quite powerful from an efficiency point of view. It is one of the things we are keeping an eye on.""

42378316,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7fo5b,1441717796,Bitcoin Group Makes Third Attempt to IPO in Australia,"Bitcoin Group is to make its third attempt to IPO this November, following two stop orders from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).  The Melbourne firm first announced it would pursue an initial public offering (IPO) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) last October, however it has faced delays following a reprimand by the regulator in February and two stop orders on its investor prospectus in July.  According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the firm lodged an updated prospectus last Friday after ASIC lifted its second stop order. Its listing date is now set for 11th November.  Bitcoin Group CEO Sam Lee told the publication that as its IPO was precedent-setting, the revisions were required so that investors could be ""fully informed"", adding:  ""ASIC's role to protect Australian investors means they need to understand our unique business model. We appreciate the patience ASIC have taken to understand what we do, and thank their co-operation in helping ensure our prospectus accurately reflects the current and future opportunity of Bitcoin Group.""  Though other bitcoin firms, including digitalBTC and Bitcoin Shop have publicly-traded shares, Bitcoin Group maintains it is the first digital currency company to IPO as it has avoided going through so-called 'backdoor listings'.  Based in Melbourne, Bitcoin Group currently offers cryptocurrency arbitrage, but told CoinDesk it would switch to mining the currency if its IPO is a success. It plans to issue 100 million new shares at 20¢ each. Some 90% of the company's funds will go towards buying CPU power.
