42378109,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9c5,1427494509,Secret Service Agent: Digital Currencies Fueling Cybercrime,"A special agent with the US Secret Service (USSS) is speaking out against bitcoin and digital currency technology on the grounds that criminal activity is its most compelling use case.  Taking place during a talk at the 17th annual OpRisk North America conference, USSS agent Tate Jarrow suggested that without digital currencies, ""cybercrime would be much more difficult"", according to report by Buy-Side Technology.  The magazine reports Jarrow ""did not hold back"" his opinion at the conference, alleging that the majority of digital currency activity is generated by criminals.  Jarrow asserted:  ""They want to use anonymous currency that allows them to do transactions, move large amounts of money, without ever being traced. That's why digital currency is very important. It's used for all this bad stuff.""  In his talks, Jarrow highlighted past examples of illicit services enabled by digital currency, including the now-defunct payment processor Liberty Reserve and black market Silk Road, which he alleged could not have been enabled by companies like PayPal.  ""Digital currency exists because people want to be outside that system,"" he added.  Jarrow was awarded the Secretary's Exceptional Service Award, which honors exceptional leadership or service that improves US homeland security, in 2014.

42378118,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9pv,1427493065,Spare Change-to-Bitcoin Service Lawnmower Aims for Main Street Investor Appeal,"""There’s a metaphor to it,"" CEO Pieter Gorsira explains, addressing his startup Lawnmower, and its, by bitcoin industry standards, unconventional name.  If the name Lawnmower at first keeps users at a distance, however, the explanation does much to illuminate the novel concept the Boost VC startup is hoping will help it become a low-risk bitcoin investment solution.  ""Working backwards, it's like we’re running the lawnmower over the grass and we’re clipping off a little bit of change. So, as you go along, we slice all these little blades of grass and collect change from these transactions,"" Gorsira continued.  Put more directly, Lawnmower uses an API developed by Spark Capital-backed Plaid to connect to users' online banking accounts at Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, Citibank and US Bank.  From there, Lawnmower watches its users' accounts for transactions, rounding up the purchase of say a $3.50 latte to $4 and saving that 50 cents for later. Once users have accumulated at least $4 in total savings through small debit or credit purchases, Lawnmower purchases bitcoin on behalf of the user.  The effect, according to Gorsira, is a solution to bitcoin's volatility that also allows investors a chance to get exposed to its potential benefits.  Gorsira told CoinDesk:  ""We’re trying to raise consumer awareness about bitcoin and give them an easy way to get in without huge commitment, so you can buy $3–$4 every couple days instead of buying bitcoin at $300 and worrying about where it’s going to go.""  As for whether the name is the best way to communicate these goals, the three-person team (complemented by CTO Patrick Archambeau and CFO Alex Sunnarborg) behind the project is confident it will resonate with consumers, or at least, differentiate it from the competition.  ""Having 'bit' or 'chain' is like an Internet company having the letter E, like E-school.com,"" Gorsira added.  Competitive edge  The idea that spare change can be converted into investments is not exactly a new one, with the concept already in use by startups like Acorns, an app that has raised $9m in funding to allow users to make small-scale investments.  Gorsira acknowledges that he was worried that Lawnmower wouldn't be first to market with the concept in the bitcoin space, expressing a fear that a company the size of Coinbase could develop a similar app ""in a week"".  Still, the team reports that Coinbase isn't interested in a similar idea for its own, and that to some extent, the company supports the Lawnmower project. ""All of the bitcoin is housed on Coinbase, so when you sign up you have to have a Coinbase account that you log in with,"" Archambeau clarified.  As for a long-term competitive advantage, Lawnmower's team sees its product evolving similarly to Acorn's in terms of the variety of investment options it offers.  ""We have a lot of different ideas like putting 20% of the savings into a different currency like litecoin, dogecoin or maybe having a slider that lets you invest 200% of your change into bitcoin,"" Gorsira said.  Beta launch  Lawnmower officially opened a beta on 25th March, allowing a small group of users into the program for an initial glimpse. Sign-ups, Archambeau said, are still available.  In part, the team wants to get some fresh air into the room in terms of the ideas that they're able to generate for the project, so that they can best align the final launch product with informed feedback.  ""We need to see what people like or don’t like so we can start adding features. The point is to have users use it, break it and tell us if they like it. [It goes] beyond three people who live in the same room everyday. We get kind of hive-minded,"" Gorsira quipped.  As for signing up for the service, beta users will need to have iOS 8 to run the TestFlight application, though Lawnmower is built for iOS 6 and 7 compatibility.  The installation process is simple provided users meet these qualifications, as the app quickly moves through a series of windows that encourage users to connect to their bank and answer security questions necessary to access the accounts.  Fiat-to-bitcoin bridge  Over time, Lawnmower sees value in creating a platform that it believes will have a unique set of users among bitcoin companies, especially given that it will in effect monitor the traditional financial behaviors of bitcoin users.  ""There’s no company in the bitcoin space that has those ties with fiat,"" Gorsira said. ""By linking your spending and saving if you will, having information on both the bitcoin and fiat side is a lot more powerful.""  Gorsira described Lawnmower as a bridge between products like Mint and Coinbase, in that it appeals to both sets of distinct users, though he believes the company will likely seek to move beyond bitcoin.  ""People are starting to get used to conscious saving. So, [we want to] target those people who are less technical and encourage them to diversify some of their assets,"" Gorsira continued, concluding:  ""We have a lot longer plans once we acquire a user base.""

42378119,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9of,1427483115,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Wall Street Goes 'Nuts',"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at global bitcoin news, analysing media and its impact.  While bitcoin's ability to deliver on its potential is still an open question, the number of Wall Street supporters for the technology grew this week, a development that was not lost in the headlines.  Wall Street's new interest in bitcoin was the talk of many major publications, spurred by the news that major American stock market Nasdaq had licensed its technology to Noble Markets and further cemented by news the Bitcoin Investment Trust, the OTC Markets investment vehicle spearheaded by investor Barry Silbert, would finally open to retail investors.  Still, the week had its share of bitcoin bashing and odd announcements.  With this in mind, CoinDesk takes a look at the top bitcoin related headlines from across the globe.  Again with the tulips  You'd be forgiven for not knowing what the Dutch Tulip mania was. To be clear, it was a period of the Dutch Golden Age during which the contract prices for tulip bulbs reached extraordinarily high levels, only to suddenly collapse thereafter.  Why is this relevant to bitcoin you ask? Well, the currency floats on the open market, meaning its price (like all currencies) is continuously fluctuating in value.  This volatility is what led Sebastian Mallaby, a British-born journalist and the senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, to compare the event with the digital currency.  Mallaby's opinion was clear, ""bitcoin is nuts"". What's also clear is the fact that he sees is it more as a passing fad, rather than an underlying cultural shift.  Featured in Bloomberg's Market Makers, Mallaby defended what the bitcoin faithful may consider an 'anachronistic' stance, saying that the cryptocurrency was a hangover from the financial crisis and commented:  ""I get why people are frustrated with the status quo, but I don't get why they think that this other thing [bitcoin] is any better. The new idea now is, I know what, we'll have something backed with nothing more than the credibility of an anonymous hacker.""  Despite his initial reservations, the journalist said that bitcoin could cheapen the electronic payments system and make them more efficient. ""Visa, Mastercard and American Express, these guys are probably too powerful, so I am in favour of competition.""  ""Digital things are cool, but I don't get why people are so believing and so credulous"", he said, playfully adding: ""Get the Winkelvoss brothers on the show, and ask them why I am crazy"".  Wall Street moves in  Mallaby might not be crazy, but he does seem a world apart from some big Wall Street players.  This week, we welcomed the news that major American stock exchange Nasdaq was entering into a first-of-its-kind partnership with Noble Markets, a New York-based bitcoin startup. The deal will see Noble use Nasdaq's X-stream technologyhttp://www.nasdaqomx.com/digitalAssets/82/82651_x-streamtrading.pdf.  Fortune and The Wall Street Journal were just two of the publications that echoed the news. At the time of press, a Google news search for the terms ""bitcoin"" and ""Nasdaq"" brought up more than 90 articles.  Writing for The Wall Street Journal Michael J. Casey said:  ""The agreement follows other Wall Street initiatives that could pave the way for financial institutions to own and trade digital currencies, which fans say have the potential to make the global financial system more efficient but which have also been marred by price fluctuations, investment scams and cybersecurity concerns.""  In his Fortune piece, Ben Geier, spoke about how bitcoin was getting help from a major financial player. But, would it be legitimate to claim that it was the other way round? Or could this be a team effort?  Geier continued:  ""Bitcoin has skyrocketed to national attention over the past few years as the leading player in the emerging digital currency space [...] it earned a bad reputation early on for being a favoured currency of thsoe to buy and sell illegal goods online, but as the Nasdaq deal highlights, it's become increasingly accepted as a legitimate financial product.""  This is certainly the latest crossover with traditional finance, but will it be the last?  'Roaring' competition  Geier is right in saying that bitcoin is the leading player, but there's a new – and perhaps over-enthusiastic – competitor in town.  This week saw the launch of LEOCoin, an altcoin created by UK-based Learning Enterprises Organisation. What's puzzling, however, is the fact that media outlets such as CNBC saw it as an encroachment of bitcoin's market, with ""Bitcoin gets a rival – how will it fare?"" as the chosen headline.  The company, notes CNBC, claims that it has ""31,176 registered businesses ready to use LEOCoin, potentially making it the ""second largest digital currency"".  To put these comments into perspective, LEOCoin is not the only altcoin trying to compete with bitcoin. Secondly, it is not even in-market – trading is due to start next week in a Hong Kong-based exchange.  Whether LEOCoin can push bitcoin out of the water remains to be seen. One thing is for certain though, it's certainly trying.  CoinDesk contacted Learning Enterprise to request a list of merchants which had signed up to use its altcoin as well as LEOCoin's white paper, but at the time of press no reply had been received.

42378098,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M9UX,1427464070,British Banking Association: Bitcoin is a Real Threat to Banks,"As cryptocurrencies grow in popularity, they will continue to threaten revenue streams of the traditional banking system, according to a new report from the British Banking Association (BBA).  A section of The Digital Disruption: UK Banking Report looks specifically at cryptocurrencies and the impact they have already had, and will continue to have, on people's perceptions of monetary transfer.  ""Cryptocurrencies increasingly look like becoming ubiquitous challengers to more familiar, established currencies. And, as they grow in popularity, so too will the risks for banks,"" the report reads.  It goes on to emphasise issues presented and faced by bitcoin, including its volatility, its perception as a haven for illegal payments activity and its relatively low market cap ($3.4bn at press time).  However, the report concedes that the risks presented to the banking system by bitcoin should not be ignored:  ""Bitcoin users can handle many of their daily payments needs themselves, without the need for interaction with banks, and avoiding the need to incur bank fees. In the same way, value stored in PayPal accounts moves outside of the bank’s payment systems, depriving banks of valuable payments revenue.""  The BBA believes it is important for banks to take action now, investing time and energy in understanding how best to use the technology behind bitcoin.  ""Banks must accept that they are increasingly part of the broader ecosystems that customers are constructing around themselves. However, their place in these ecosystems is far from secure,"" the report concludes.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/27/british-banking-association-bitcoin-is-a-real-threat-to-banks,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42398287,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT76B,1427455160,Bitcoin-to-Cash Service Bit2Me Cancels Fees to Stay Competitive,"Bitcoin-to-cash service Bit2Me has cancelled its commission fees in a bid to remain competitive in the Spanish market.  The announcement follows on from BTCPoint, another withdrawal service which launched earlier this month with zero commission fees.  Previously, Bit2Me charged its users a 1% commission fee per transaction, raising some concerns among Spain's bitcoin community.  Daniel Diez, business development manager at Bit2Me, attributed the decision to a shift in focus from monetisation to short-term growth, adding:    ""Our main priority is to offer the best possible service. We were the first to develop a technology that enables the widespread use of bitcoin. This [the widespread use] remains our mission and is what sets us apart from the rest of our competitors.""            Immediacy and flexibility  The news comes amid further improvements including immediate withdrawals – previously users were having to wait an average of 10 minutes – and the increase of users' daily allowance from €100 to €300.  Consumers wanting to increase their allowance further will be subjected to further ID checks by the company, said Diez.  Diez also revealed that Bit2Me also has agreements in place to expand into Romania and Poland in ""less than a month"". He said:  ""We have always been interested in expanding outside the eurozone, as we can offer an added value service due to the fact that it is harder to move capital in these countries and the local fiat currencies are more unstable.""  Spain boasts an increasing migrant population from both Romania and Poland.  According to The Guardian, Eurostat data showed that there were approximately 85,862 Poles living in Spain in 2012, whilst Diez says that there are currently ""over a million"" Romanian immigrants in the country.  Bit2Me recently closed a round of seed funding, but Diez was unwilling to disclose the specifics.
