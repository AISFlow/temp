The company is expected to see a rebound in margin and adjusted EPS in FY2023. The higher valuation can be attributed to its higher growth potential and promising margin outlook. Lower inflation expectations, as highlighted by the recent CPI report, provide additional support. Cash App ecosystem, a key growth engine, remains robust, with additional monetization opportunities from features like savings accounts and the Cash App Card. Investment Thesis Block (SQ) has faced downward pressure on its stock price since early FY2022, primarily due to a significant deceleration in top-line growth resulting from many factors, such as pull-forward demand, a decline in B2B spending, and increased competition. Despite delivering decent 1Q FY2023 results, the stock's performance was muted, with only a 2% rally in the aftermarket. SQ's lackluster YTD return (recently exhibited some upside momentum due to the decline in CPI data) clearly indicates that it missed out on the hype surrounding the recent AI thematic rally. This mediocre performance was below both the S&P500 and Nasdaq, as the company failed to impress investors with its long-term AI roadmap. I admit that SQ's fundamentals, particularly its bottom-line, have significantly deteriorated over the past year. However, the company is now focusing on improving margins and driving earnings growth in FY2023. Although the valuation is still not at a bargain, even after a 72% pullback from its pandemic peak, I believe that investors will appreciate the company's efforts to prioritize profitability and FCF profile. Additionally, we have seen a strong recovery in cryptocurrencies in recent months, which could boost its Bitcoin Gross Profit line. Therefore, I remain optimistic about the stock, as the worst may be behind us. Look Through Near-Term Headwinds The company model Investors may be curious about the reasons behind SQ's sharp 75% drop in early FY2022 and why its upward momentum has been limited since then. Some may argue that considering the company's FY2023 adjusted EBITDA outlook, SQ has maintained an impressive 34.4% CAGR in adjusted EBITDA from FY2019 to FY2023E. The company model In reality, there were both macro and micro challenges in FY2022. Firstly, SQ's fundamentals saw a significant decline. The company experienced a sharp decrease in transaction-based revenue due to sluggish growth in GPV. The point-of-sale ((POS)) industry has become increasingly competitive, with some major players expanding their market shares such as Apple Pay. As a result, SQ's adjusted EBITDA growth declined by -2.2% YoY in FY2022, leading to a -41.5% YoY growth in adjusted EPS. This indicated that the stock price could easily drop 41.5% without impacting its valuation. Additionally, when examining the chart, we can see that three key margins (adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income margin, and FCF margin), which most investors focus on, were at their lowest levels since FY2017. From the Macro perspective, the federal fund rate has sharply increased in FY2022 as the fed became hawkish to combat 40-year high inflation . Under this backdrop, high growth stocks with deteriorating fundamentals like SQ were particularly vulnerable. Therefore, I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock experienced a significant selloff. Nevertheless, as a long-term investor, we should look through the company's near-term headwinds and focused on its secular growth catalysts. For example, the pandemic has undoubtedly accelerated the digital transformation, with more merchants and customers relying on fintech transaction products and services. Connecting Square Ecosystem and Cash App 2022 Investor Day During the Investor Day in 2022, it was highlighted that Square's business model has undergone significant changes over the past few years. In 2015, a majority of their gross profit was derived from merchants using Square for Payments. However, by 2021, the largest revenue stream has shifted to software and integrated payments, which, along with banking and international operations, have been growing at a faster pace than payments revenue. As the screenshot indicated, the company is currently focused on integrating Afterpay into its ecosystem, aiming to establish a connection between Square and Cash App. This integration is expected to be beneficial in terms of customer acquisition and increasing the lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ( LTV/CAC ) ratio over the long term. Nevertheless, the management has cautioned that the integration of Afterpay may temporarily impact margins. However, they remain optimistic about the future synergies and potential benefits associated with the deal. We can observe in Historical Financial Information that Cash App's margins are currently lower than those of Square due to higher variable expenses such as P2P processing, risk loss, and card issuance costs. Cash App Margin Remains Robust Investor Relations - Historical Financial Information Based on the screenshot from the company's Excel model, we saw that the growth of subscription and services-based revenue remains strong in both Square and Cash App ecosystem. The Cash App growth history has been remarkable, with a 61% YoY growth in FY2022. The gross profit of Cash App has been largely contributed by Instant Deposit and Cash App Card, which achieved an impressive 43% YoY growth in the last fiscal year. Moreover, the introduction of savings accounts and the Cash App Card has also played an important role in expanding monetization over the long term. As mentioned earlier, the Cash App ecosystem currently maintains a lower margin of 28% compared to the Square ecosystem's margin of 45%. However, there has been a notable improvement in margins, with a strong expansion from 17% in FY2021. In addition, we should keep in mind that the gross profit from the Cash App ecosystem was affected by a significant slowdown in Bitcoin transactions during FY2022. However, considering the recent strong recovery in cryptocurrencies, this could potentially generate positive sentiment among investors. Margin Improvement in FY2023 The company model Indeed, FY2022 was a challenging year for SQ. However, there are many positive signs to consider. The adjusted EBITDA margin has rebounded from its recent low, indicating a positive trend. Additionally, in 1Q FY2023, the company not only exceeded expectations in terms of revenue and adjusted EPS but also raised its FY2023 outlook for adjusted EBITDA. During the earnings call , the management is expected to see an expansion in Cash App margin, which would contribute to overall margin expansion for the company. This suggests that investors can anticipate a recovery in profitability in the current fiscal year. If SQ can sustain consistent earnings growth and continue expanding its margins, it should boost more confidence in investors, even in the face of a slowdown in overall top-line and GMV growth. Valuation 1Q23 Shareholder Letter When considering SQ's adjusted EBITDA outlook for FY2023, the stock is currently trading at a higher multiple compared to PayPal ( PYPL ). SQ's EV/adjusted EBITDA FY2023E stands at 32.7x, while PYPL is at 10.5x. Similarly, SQ's P/E Fwd of 42x is higher than PYPL's 14.3x, despite SQ's strong rebound in adjusted EPS. Therefore, I don't consider SQ as a value stock right now. However, I believe that SQ can demand a higher multiple due to its greater growth potential and strong outlook for margin expansion compared to peers. Furthermore, the June CPI report indicates a significant decrease in inflation, with YoY inflation standing at 3% and core CPI dropping to 4.8%. This reduction in inflation could serve as a positive catalyst for high valuation growth stocks like SQ. If the US economy achieves a soft-landing scenario, SQ's valuation could be supported by lower inflation expectations and a favorable outlook on long-term interest rates. Conclusion In conclusion, despite a 72% drop in stock price from the pandemic high, SQ shows many positive signs with an anticipated rebound in margin and profitability in FY2023. Moreover, Cash App's growth remains strong, driven by Instant Deposit and Cash App Card. While SQ's valuation may not currently be considered a bargain, as the fintech market leader, its potential for top-line growth and margin improvement following a cyclical downturn justifies a higher multiple compared to its peers. Most importantly, lower inflation expectations indicated by the June CPI report could benefit high valuation growth stocks like SQ. Therefore, considering the recent muted price action, I maintain a positive on the stock and view this as a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4617198-block-favorable-macro-and-micro-factors-could-drive-stock-higher?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14972065.jpeg

The ruling found that Ripple Labs' crypto asset XRP ( XRP-USD ) can be considered a security in some cases and not a security in others. Whether an asset is considered a security is important, because that would decide whether the Securities and Exchange Commmision has the authority to regulate the trading of the assets. And that means the exchange and the entity issuing the security would be subject to a raft of regulations. In December 2020, the SEC sued Ripple Labs and two senior executives, alleging that Ripple is a security. As such, when selling the XRP, Ripple would have to register the offering with the SEC. In addition, the exchange on which the offering takes place would also have to register. In June 2023, the SEC also sued Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ), alleging that it's operating as an unregistered securities broker. U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres said in her summary judgment that Institutional Sales of Ripple constitute the sale of unregistered securities. She pointed out the Ripple Labs' marketing materials as backing up that view. That part of the lawsuit will not go to trial. But the judge gave no indication of penalty or fine in the judgment, Barclays analysts Ramsey El-Assal and Benjamin Budish said in a note to clients. ""The Court finds that reasonable investors, situated in the position of the Institutional Buyers, would have purchased XRP with the expectation that they would derive profits from Ripple’s efforts,"" the judge wrote in her ruling. To qualify as a security, Torres applied the Howey test, which the SEC has used to make its claims that many crypto assets are also securities. Under the Howey test for an investment contract, an asset must be an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits made through the efforts of others, according to the SEC . Programmatic sales, which are essentially secondary sales executed by individuals on exchanges, do not satisfy the definition of a security, the judge said, as the investor is not putting money into the ""common enterprise."" That dispute will proceed to trial, the Barclays analysts said. Also at issue are ""other distributions"", which involved the use of XRP as payment to such parties as employees or vendors. Since the recipients of the assets didn't invest money in them, they don't qualify as securities, the Torres said. That part will also move to trial. ""Our read of [Thursday's] ruling is that marketing and context matter — in other words, the way the token was sold to investors impacts whether or not it is a security,"" said El-Assal and Budish. Needham analyst John Todaro sees the ruling as a positive for Coinbase Global ( COIN ) ""as it sets precedent that crypto token sales through exchanges, at least in the XRP case, did not violate securities laws. We believe this outcome should moderately de-risk the regulatory pressure on the stock."" The ruling also gives him some optimism that Coinbase ( COIN ) will eventually benefit from bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs that are in the pipeline. ""Additionally, recent bitcoin ETF applications from major financial institutions that are using Coinbase for various services gives us further comfort regarding broad support for the ecosystem and Coinbase,"" he wrote. Coinbase ( COIN ) stock climbed ~33% in the last week and doubled in the past month as major financial institutions filed applications for spot bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs. BTC, meanwhile, rose 3.9% for the week and 21% for the month. Compass Point analyst Chase White agrees. ""This ruling, at least in our view, removes any shadow of a doubt that ETH (ethereum) is a security while also being quite positive for altcoins, both seeing strength following the decision,"" he wrote in a note to clients. White sees not only gains for ether ( ETH-USD ) and the altcoins, but expects that a Grayscale/GBTC win agains the SEC ""will be a catalyst for higher prices and ETF approvals and institutional adoption."" That, in turn, could lead to a supply shock due to the lack of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) available to buy. ""With liquidity conditions remaining weak and the macro picture still uncertain, we wouldn't be surprised to see crypto assets become more volatile in the short-term, but any moves to the downside should be viewed as a buying opportunity for crypto assets and crypto-related stocks,"" White said in a note to clients.

14956034,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=542846,1689510871,Synthetix (SNX) Up By 35% In Anticipation Of New Decentralized Exchange,"SNX, the native token of the Synthetix Network, has been on the rise, gaining more than 35% in the past week. The cryptocurrency continues to exhibit strong bullish momentum, having registered a positive market performance over the past few weeks. SNX’s recent price surge has been linked to the positive sentiment surrounding the Synthetix network. A few days ago, the protocol announced its plan to release a new decentralized exchange (DEX). Related Reading: Dogecoin Engagement Fails To Impress, Raising Concerns About Broader Interest Synthetix Token Tallies 35% In One Week – Price Overview The cryptocurrency market experienced a jolt of positivity after the long-running battle between payments and technology firm Ripple – the company behind XRP – and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) came to a positive conclusion on Thursday. US District Judge Annalisa Torres delivered a landmark judgment declaring the XRP token as non-security, thereby granting a decisive triumph for Ripple. However, unlike other cryptocurrencies, the price of SNX barely reacted to this piece of news. The token’s value increased by a mere 5% following the announcement of the court’s decision. SNX did experience a surge of its own the following day. On Friday, July 14, the token’s price jumped by nearly 40%, touching the $3 level before retracing back to $2.5. As of this writing, the Synthetix token is valued at $2.82, with an 8% price increase in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $903.4 million, SNX ranks as the 47th-biggest cryptocurrency, according to CoinGecko data. SNXUSD trading at $2.738 | Source: SNXUSD chart from TradingView The recent increase in SNX’s price is believed to have been triggered by the announcement of a new Synthetix trading product. In a blogpost released on Friday, the protocol’s founder Kain Warwick unveiled plans to introduce a new derivatives front-end called Infinex. What Is Infinex? Infinex is a new derivatives front-end to the decentralized trading infrastructure of Synthetix. The exchange is expected to be an improvement on the already-existing Kwenta, Synthetix’s derivatives decentralized exchange on Optimism. According to Kain Warwick, Infinex will remove the impediments to the growth of Synthetix’s decentralized trading ecosystem. Firstly, it will address the inconvenience of acquiring sUSD, Synthetix’s stablecoin, to begin trading on Kwenta. Also, it will eliminate the need to sign every action on the current platform. Warwick claims that the purpose of Infinex is to provide competition for centralized exchanges (CEXs) while eliminating any uncertainty surrounding decentralized perpetuals (Perps). The blogpost also revealed that Infinex will cater to users familiar with CEX platforms, providing its trading services through a username and password. With this, users would be able to generate a public-private key pair, which will be locally stored in the browser. It is worth noting that this key pair is not designed for fund withdrawals. Instead, it would be used to sign trades on the upcoming decentralized exchange. While the blogpost didn’t reveal the exact launch date of Infinex, it disclosed that the project’s introduction should come alongside the release of Synthetix’s Perps V3.

The report suggests that Bitcoin's price and transaction fees need to rise substantially to balance the reduced block reward. Unsettling Times Ahead for Miners The analysis predicts potential difficulties for Bitcoin miners as the hash rate, representing the computational power used to mine cryptocurrency, hits new highs. Factors such as fluctuating electricity costs and intensified competition among miners are expected to increase the cost of production. The halving event, which takes place approximately every four years, will cut miners' rewards by half. ""The upcoming bitcoin halving event in April/May 2024 could be a stress test for Bitcoin miners,"" states the report, co-authored by JP Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. This event will lower the issuance rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, effectively reducing miners’ revenue while concurrently increasing Bitcoin’s production cost. The report explains that while Bitcoin halving typically has a positive impact on the Bitcoin price given that the production cost has historically acted as a floor, it presents a considerable challenge for miners. ""[The halving] would reduce the issuance rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, implying a reduction in miners’ revenue, effectively increasing Bitcoin’s production cost at the same time [...] As a result, while Bitcoin halving is seen as having a positive effect on the bitcoin price given the production cost acted historically as a floor, it poses a challenge for bitcoin miners,"" the report indicated. Hash Rate Volatility and Energy Costs Based on a global average electricity cost of $0.05/kWh, it presently costs around $20,000 to mine a Bitcoin, currently valued at around $30,000 according to public blockchain explorer data. JP Morgan highlighted the hash rate's volatility, suggesting a range of energy sources and potential advantages for miners who have access to lower-priced power. The firm revealed that a one-cent increase in the cost per kilowatt-hour translates into a $4,300 increase in Bitcoin production costs. After the halving event, this sensitivity is expected to double, thereby escalating the risk and susceptibility for higher-cost producers (in simpler terms, they will effectively be ""priced out"" of the competitive sphere for Bitcoin mining). Institutional Support and the Importance of Rising Bitcoin Prices The report also points to growing institutional interest in Bitcoin mining as a source of support for struggling miners, citing investments in mining rigs from companies like Galaxy Digital and Grayscale Investments. The report stated: ""It seems unlikely that the Bitcoin hash rate will continue to rise at the same pace post the April/May 2024 halving event without any sustained rise in the Bitcoin price above its production cost or a large increase in transaction fees that could offset the reduction in issuance rewards."" Despite this, however, to offset the lower block reward, JP Morgan stresses that Bitcoin's price and transaction fees must see substantial growth. The analysts furtherl noted that declining enthusiasm around cryptocurrencies could pose an additional challenge for miners' revenues, if indeed the trend in terms of declining interest in crypto proves to be a long-term trend.

According to an interview from Garlinghouse with Bloomberg on July 15, the executive estimates that the SEC's opportunity for appeal could take ""years."" No other precise detail in terms of this claim was disclosed, however. Judge's Ruling on XRP On July 13, Judge Torres partially ruled in favor of Ripple Labs in a lawsuit initiated by the SEC in 2020. The judgement states that the XRP token, with respect to retail sales on digital asset exchanges, is not a security. However, Judge Torres ruled that XRP qualifies as a security when sold to institutional investors, in accordance with the criteria of the Howey Test. Garlinghouse emphasized that the ruling about institutional sales represents ""the smallest piece"" of the lawsuit. He believes that if the SEC decides to appeal the ruling regarding retail sales, it would only ""further solidify"" Judge Torres' decision. Garlinghouse said: ""As a matter of law, the law of the land right now is that XRP is not a security. Until there is an opportunity for the SEC to file an appeal, which would take years, frankly, we are very optimistic.” SEC Accused of Bullying Tactics Garlinghouse also took the opportunity to criticize the SEC, alleging it acted as a ""bully"" by targeting ""weak players"" in the crypto industry incapable of mounting a strong defense. He indicated that the Ripple lawsuit marked the first defeat for the SEC in a ""crypto case."" The Ripple CEO noted the SEC's lawsuit initially led to uncertainty among U.S. crypto exchanges, causing a wait-and-see attitude due to market confusion. According to Garlinghouse, the SEC deliberately fostered this confusion to increase its power, thereby stifling innovation in the U.S. Impact on the Crypto Market Garlinghouse argued that the SEC's power play and political manoeuvring have overshadowed sound policy and clear regulatory guidelines. This stance, he says, has hampered U.S. entrepreneurs and investors from fully participating in the crypto market and embracing blockchain technologies. While the recent performance of XRP may be impacted by these developments, the broader implications revolve around regulatory clarity in the crypto industry, and this is something that requires closer attention in terms of how it evolves and becomes more complex with each new case.

This initiative, referred to as Polkadot 2.0, reimagines the network's architecture as a conglomerate of sovereign chains connected by treaty-like 'accords.' During the fourth Decoded conference, Wood illustrated his vision, likening Polkadot's journey of discovery to Ethereum's, another project he co-founded. Rethinking Polkadot's Infrastructure After launching Polkadot in May 2020, Wood transitioned from his CEO role at Parity Technologies to the network's chief architect in October 2022. Polkadot's core primitive, the parachain auctions, was not unveiled until November 2021, amidst the previous crypto bull market. The move caused a sharp price surge in Polkadot's native token, DOT, but later faced issues due to the competitive and fluctuating environment of parachain auctions. From Parachains to Cores Wood sees Polkadot as a multicore computer, with reserved cores for the parachains. However, the core of Polkadot 2.0's vision lies in a shift from a focus on chains to one on 'space' or resources that chains need. Wood highlighted the necessity of a more agile system, noting that the slot auction model, whcile appealing, presented both perceived and real barriers. Under the proposed framework, 'core time' would be allocated via a marketplace. This marketplace would cater to both on-demand (instantaneous) and long-term (bulk) needs. Wood suggested that these monthly blocks of core time would be represented by NFTs, which can be fractionalized, letting owners of bulk time allocarte computation on a Polkadot core. This means that all currently existing leases would continue under the new system, with the bulk pricing requiring initialization by governance. Shifting to an Application-Centric Model The Polkadot 2.0 proposal is all about application-centricity as opposed to chain-centricity. Wood pointed out that Polkadot is ultimately a platform for building applications for users, and these applications should ideally span across chains seamlessly, both from a user and developer perspective. The robust nature of Polkadot's infrastructure allows deploying a pseudo network rather than just an application, which demands additional care regarding collators and network uptime. In some instances, it might be preferable to deploy smart contracts directly on cores, thus entirely bypassing the parachain concept. The proposed Polkadot 2.0 initiative represents a significant evolution of the blockchain network, focusing more on resources (space) over chains. By redesigning its resource allocation model, Polkadot hopes to make the system more agile, with a focus on applications and user experience.
