42379353,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Yyn,1490734839,Arizona Lawmakers Pass Blockchain Records Bill,"Arizona's legislature has cleared a bill that would recognize blockchain signatures and smart contracts under state law, sending it to the governor's desk for final approval.  The measure, as previously reported by CoinDesk, would make data tied to a blockchain ""considered to be in an electronic format and to be an electronic record"" in Arizona. It also notably featured language specifically related to smart contracts, signifying an effort to capture new kinds of delivering information – in this case, via blockchain – under existing rules.  The bill's authors wrote:  ""'Smart contract' means an event-driven program, with state, that runs on a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger and that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger.""  Public records show that the bill was sent to sent to Gov. Doug Ducey's office on 27th March after clearing the Senate by a 28-1 vote on the 23rd. While it's not immediately clear if or when the governor will sign the bill, the broad support the bill saw in the legislature – members of the legislature's lower chamber approved it unanimously late last month – suggests the measure could ultimately get the greenlight.  The bill is akin to legislation passed and signed into law last year in Vermont. Lawmakers in the state proposed allowing data embedded on a blockchain to be used in a court of law.

The decision, published today, presents the second bitcoin-tied ETF turned down by the SEC since the start of the month. On 10th March, the agency rejected an effort from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to list a bitcoin ETF on the Bats BZX Exchange – though last week Bats moved to fight that rebuffing, seeking an effective rehearing of the SEC’s decision.  In its notice, the SEC cited justifications similar to those used in the Winklevoss ETF decision, namely a lack of market surveillance and a dearth of regulation in some jurisdictions.  The SEC wrote:  ""The Commission believes that, in order to meet this standard, an exchange that lists and trades shares of commodity-trust exchange-traded products (""ETPs"") must, in addition to other applicable requirements, satisfy two requirements that are dispositive in this matter. First, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated.""  The agency had earlier moved to delay its decision in September, punting a final determination until the end of this week at the latest. While representatives for the SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment, some kind of decision (or another delay) was anticipated by Friday.

Two representatives of BBVA will officially join the initiative, connecting the conglomerate with the 100-plus startups and businesses already involved.  The move marks the third umbrella-style blockchain project the bank has joined, as it's an existing member of both the R3 distributed ledger consortium and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. The bank has also moved to invest in the space, given that BBVA Ventures, the bank’s private equity subsidiary, took part in in Coinbase’s $75m funding round in January 2015.  Carlos Kuchkovsky, new digital business CTO for BBVA, said in a statement:  ""We believe that Hyperledger will be fundamental to ensuring standardization and interoperability in the different technologies and platforms that will make blockchain a powerful tool that will transform business processes and social relationships.""  The agreementhttps://www.bbva.com/en/news/economy/financial-and-commercial-services/fintech/bbva-joins-hyperledger-top-open-source-blockchain-community/ with the Linux Foundation, which backs the Hyperledger project, will see BBVA share and collaborate on code, as well as work with representatives from other firms.  Hyperledger has added a range of new members in the past several months. Notable entrants include the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Bank of England, two central banks which joined the initiative in late February. Since the start of the year, companies like American Express and Daimler AG have also moved to take part.

42379350,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Yv1,1490709857,IBM Unveils Blockchain Platform for Oil Trade Finance,"A group of companies including IBM has spearheaded the development of a new blockchain-based crude oil trade finance platform.  Along with IBM, commodities trading group Trafigura and corporate investment bank Natixis took part in the creation of the platform, built using code from the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger project. IBM’s BlueMix cloud hosting service is also being utilized.  Within the system, parties can view transaction data as it is published on the blockchain. The platform also hosts documentation and updates on shipments, deliveries and payments.  Natixis, a member of the R3 distributed ledger consortium, is no stranger to trade finance applications of blockchain, having joined with the ""Digital Trade Chain"" project last year.  According to Arnaud Stevens, Natixis’ head of global energy and commodities in New York, the bank sees the tech as potentially bringing down costs while also boosting procedural transparency.  Stevens said in a statement:  ""We want to use blockchain to optimize the antiquated arena of commodity trade finance. The current process is paper and labor intensive, we have multiple friction points with high processing costs and limited automation. Distributed ledger technology brings some much-needed innovation into our industry.""  The platform’s introduction marks the latest bridging of the blockchain and trade finance worlds. It’s an application that has attracted significant interest from a range of companies and governments worldwide, including Dubai.  Many of the world’s banks also continue to push ahead with related projects focused on the commodities trade.

42379367,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87ZBN,1490706031,More Banks to Sign Up for ING's Ethereum Oil Trading Platform,"Dutch bank ING is winding down work on more than 20 blockchain applications, and that’s a good thing, according to one of the bank’s directors of innovation.  That’s because what remains from a host of small experiments aimed at creating models, understanding blockchain interoperability and developing a wide variety of technical skills are five applications currently being developed into pilots for real-world applications.  While multiple pilots are still being developed behind closed doors, two have already been revealed. One is a soon-to-be-launched platform for trading natural gas. The other is an oil trading pilot built on ethereum that has already conducted live transactions.  Now, the bank’s head of wholesale banking innovation, Ivar Wiersma, has revealed to CoinDesk that ING is preparing to open the platform up to other banks with an eye, not just to saving money, but generating revenue too.  Wiersma explained the strategy behind the decision to CoinDesk:  ""It's easier if you only work with a small number of people to make decisions on tests and iterate and test your hypotheses and test your metrics. Only in the next stage will we be looking to expand that network.""  Details of the project originally revealed in a closed meeting held with potential partners at the International Petroleum Week last month provide a rare look at how ING's ethereum-based platform functions.  Conducted on what ING calls the Easy Trading Connect blockchain prototype, the live transactions between ING, Société Générale and commodities trading house Mercuria, involved an oil cargo shipment of African crude oil that was sold three times on its way to China.  By moving the transactions to a private version of the ethereum blockchain, an encrypted copy of the bill of lading is sent to a seller while ING’s platform verifies that pertinent documents comply with the smart contract that defined the terms of the transaction.  In the live trial, the average time it took for one of the banks to complete its role in the transaction dropped from about three hours using traditional analogue solution to 25 minutes on a distributed ledger. For traders, efficiency increased 33%, according to the company.  With the cost savings as a result of these efficiencies estimated by Mercuria to be as high as 30%, the potential margins available to platform providers is immense.  Currently, it is unclear what the business model behind the service will be as other banks are brought on. But Wiersma told CoinDesk that ING is now exploring both a subscription model and a fee-based system that might charge per transaction.  Describing how this latest stage of development could impact each of ING's blockchain pilots, he said:  ""We don’t know what the winners will be, we don’t know what the applications will be or who will be the winning parties. But there’s a lot more [value] in addition to cost and capital savings.""  Traction within  Formally launched a year ago from an informal group of “enthusiastic” blockchain supporters, the Blockchain Innovation Team behind these efforts now consists of about 10 full-engineers.  Sitting within the Amsterdam-based bank’s wholesale banking division, the group has clipped back its initial group of 27 blockchain proofs-of-concept in six business areas to four or five concepts now in various stages of being taken to pilot with live transactions.  A founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, ING has conducted experiments with platforms also including R3’s Corda platform, Hyperledger’s Fabric platform and Digital Asset Holdings’ DAML.  While the oil trading platform was built with ethereum, details about ING's other efforts are expected to be revealed soon.  To ensure these projects are developed with the end-user in mind, the team breaks down its work into three categories: technology (whether a blockchain is even needed), strategy (how it fits into ING's larger offerings) and whether or not the idea has 'business buy-in' from executives who would have to oversee implementation.  ""We allocate specific people from business to work with focused teams on specific use cases,"" said Wiersma. ""It’s not only the technology team that is working with blockchain, but we link this in with different business divisions within the bank.""  Talent farm  But there is also an unofficial fourth part of ING’s effort to build blockchain into 'end-to-end' solutions for products that serve trade finance, KYC, post-trade and more.  In addition to technology, strategy and buy-in, the company is engaging in an outreach effort that results in a combined publicity effort and talent search.  After co-sponsoring the Dutch Blockchain Hackathon last month, ING created the peripheral 'Cash me if you can' challenge in which the 1,500 participants were offered ether tokens trapped behind a faulty bank smart contract. The first to crack the problem, got the ether.  Earlier in the day, ING also hosted a series of 'master classes' in which its engineers taught a group of participants some of the basic skills they would need to build blockchain applications.  As a result, ING became the latest in a number of organizations actively engaged in not only building blockchain applications to streamline a wide range of industries, but helping seed the bed of talent available to the industry.  Wiersma concluded:  ""It’s not only about running projects and bringing things to market as quickly as we can, but it’s also running these hackathons, making sure we interact with a number of young startups.""

42379357,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Z2Z,1490702707,"With Ethereum 'Ice Age' Incoming, Momentum Builds for Miner Pay Cut","A vote currently taking place on ethereum's mining rewards has motivated a big response from its community, despite the fact that its results are non-binding.  Described simply as a 'show of preference' by organizers, the vote is designed to indicate support for Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) #186 – a change that, if implemented, would reduce the reward allocated to miners from the current level of 5 ethers per block to a lower figure.  According to the proposal's abstract:  ""A reduction in the issuance of ether is very likely to be price-supportive and lead to increasing investments in the platform and to help ward off speculative attacks on the value of ether by promoters of competing platforms who offer, or plan to offer, reduced token inflation rates.""  Besides the financial aspect, the proposal is also linked to the coming 'ice age', hard-coded into the technology.  At this point, ethereum is set to incentivize its transition from 'proof-of-work' (PoW) to 'proof-of-stake' (PoS) consensus at which time an exponential rise in block difficulty will make blocks virtually impossible to solve by PoW.  Price shift  In a conversation with CoinDesk, Matthew Light, software developer and author of EIP186, explained more of the logic behind his proposal.    Though it's now receiving attention due to the vote currently underway, Light pointed out that the first version of the proposal appeared in December 2016, when ether was trading at a much lower value: around the $7–$8 dollar mark.    Since the low market value of ether equated to fewer funds for ethereum developers, Light said that original perception was that the ethereum project as a whole was being undervalued.  ""At that time, I felt that it would be advantageous for everyone for the technology to be priced higher, and that reducing issuance would benefit that ... But price has increased tremendously since then, so making it go up is no longer a critical issue,"" Light said.  Raising the value of ether wouldn't be the only result of a decrease in the block rewards, however.  The developer cited a recent Medium post from Vlad Zamfir, a core researcher at the ethereum foundation and architect of the forthcoming proof-of-stake system. In the post, Zamfir argues that over-incentivizing mining with high rewards attracts miners who are less concerned with good governance of the ecosystem as a whole.  Zamfir writes:  ""When miners become more powerful, everyone else gets less of a say.""  The issue of governance is also at question in how the EIP itself is treated, coming as it does from a relatively unknown developer in the community, but having won widespread support.  ""I actually don't think the most important thing is to pass this EIP right now,"" said Light. ""What I think is more interesting is to see how the Ethereum Foundation will deal with it.""  Ether dilution  Although Light doesn't consider the reward decrease a pressing change just yet, others think differently.  The current vote on the EIP is being held via carbonvote.com, which allows ethereum users to vote with ether tokens. The platform was originally set up for the community to vote on whether to rewrite the blockchain's transaction history in the aftermath of the DAO hack.  On the table is the motion: ""The ice age should not be extended without at least some decrease in block rewards."" Thus far, the tally is overwhelmingly favoring a range of affirmative responses.  Support for the motion – in which holders of ether get votes in proportion to the size of their holdings – is due to the fact that the coming 'ice age' will most likely be postponed due to non-completion of the PoS system by the necessary deadline.  Ether holders had anticipated that new ether would be mined more slowly after the ice age, increasing the value of coins already in existence.  Postponement of the transition, however, would mean a continuation of existing rates of mining, leading to an unforeseen increase in supply and dilution of the value of held coins – hence the motion to reduce the rate at which miners receive ether rewards if the ice age is delayed.  As well as benefitting holders of ether, Light believes that adoption of the proposal would also lead to a more carefully considered transition to proof of stake, since there would no longer be a financial incentive to keep to schedule.  He said:  ""If there's a reduction in issuance, there's a lot less pressure from the community to get proof of stake released before perhaps it's ready.""

42379349,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87YrF,1490698612,Chinese Lender CreditEase Launches Blockchain Supply Chain Service,"One of China's largest peer-to-peer lending services has launched a private blockchain service based on ethereum.  Sina Tech reported today that CreditEase (known as Yixin in China) debuted the service at its own conference, showcasing how the platform (called 'BlockWorm') can store and secure blockchain data.  The report indicated that CreditEase would now seek to test the application, called CreditStorage, as a supply chain tool for enterprise businesses. CreditEase will reportedly work with a steel trading platform on integrating the service.  Founded in 2006, the Beijing-based startup offers microfinance services, connecting small borrowers with lenders via a web platform. Investors include Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Morgan Stanley and IDG Capital.  The company first began exploring blockchain following its participation in Circle's $60m Series D via its CreditEase Fintech Investment Fund, according to the report. (At the time, Circle was seeking to expand its services into China, opening its own domestic subsidiary, Circle China.)

42379348,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Ytl,1490692848,War of the Words: Who's Said What About a Bitcoin Fork?,"Bitcoin is abuzz with chatter about the prospects of a possible network split, a development that could drive the emergence of two separate blockchains.  Speculation has grown in recent weeks that miners and users backing Bitcoin Unlimited – an alternative bitcoin software implementation that seeks to change the network's rule set – may effectively ""fork"" off the network, if not everyone agrees to migrate to their changes.  It's an eventuality that has businesses in the industry weighing in again on a long-standing impasse over the digital currency's future direction.  What's more, the nature and tone of the scaling debate appears to have sharpened, driven by animosity between those who support one vision over another. As such, a range of bitcoin startups (exchanges, wallet providers, miners and hardware makers) have weighed in on where they stand on the issue.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, much of the preparation seen comes from companies that would find themselves in possession of handling two separate bitcoin assets on behalf of customers should the network split.  A number of the statements, in addition to outlining policy, seek to assuage possible user concerns ahead of a split over the safety – and accessibility – of their money.  In this feature, CoinDesk takes a look at what these businesses are saying about the possible fork – and how they’re preparing for what could become a potentially messy situation.  Wallets  As might be expected, those working on wallet projects have positioned themselves – and their policies – ahead of a fork. Overall, the positions in this sector seem to focus on ensuring ease of use during a potentially disruptive period.  Here’s what those working in the wallet space have said thus far:    Name: KeepKey    Service: Hardware wallet    The startup told CoinDesk that, in the event of a fork, it would let users manage two accounts, one for each version of the blockchain.  ""Our commitment is to our customers and we want to ensure that they can can safely transact on both sides of the fork should that happen,"" CEO Darin Stanchfield told CoinDesk.    Name: Ledger    Service: Hardware wallet    Reiterating that hardware wallet users wouldn't lose access to their bitcoins, Ledger said that, in the event of a split, it would release a software update allowing them to manage both currencies.  However, it was not immediately clear if this would be a short-term move.  ""Should multiple chains prove to be viable in the long run, Ledger will update its Ledger Wallet Bitcoin Chrome app to add a BTC-C/BTC-U switch (in the same way that our Ethereum Chrome app has a ETH/ETC switch),” the company said.  ""Users will then be able to independently manage their BTC-C and BTC-U coins, without having to export their private keys.""    Name: SatoshiLabs    Service: Hardware wallet    SatoshiLabs, which also operates the Slush mining pool, said on 20th March that its users of its Trezor line of hardware wallets would be able to access Bitcoin Unlimited tokens in the event that two blockchains emerge.  ""Should Bitcoin Unlimited (BTU) split away and be implemented in TREZOR Wallet, it would be provided as another option in the currency selector. Therefore, in terms of the security of your coins, a little has changed — no action is required from you [and] your coins remain safe,"" the firm said, adding:  ""You will not magically lose coins because of a fork.""    Name: Samourai    Service: Wallet software    Wallet software provider Samourai detailed its (albiet brief) plan for a hard fork potential on 20th March via Twitter.  ""Wallet Users: Samourai continues to run Bitcoin Core 0.14. There are no plans to switch to any implementation that breaks current consensus,"" the team behind the software said.    Name: Armory    Service: Wallet software    The open-source project said this week that it wasn’t taking a side in the ongoing debate, but outlined steps that users could take in the event of a fork.    Name: Circle    Service: Wallet provider    Circle detailed its policy change in an email to users last week, a move that came months after the startup did away with its bitcoin buying and selling services.  ""This bitcoin downtime will likely occur immediately upon a 'fork' of bitcoin with little to no warning, and during this period of bitcoin downtime you will not have access to bitcoin that you hold in your Circle account,"" the startup said.    Name: Breadwallet    Service: Wallet software    In a 24th March statement, the team behind the Breadwallet wallet software said that it would ""continue to connect to the chain that is the most popular amongst miners"", signaling that it would support the blockchain with the most mining power.  Notably, the team indicated its belief that, in the event of a fork, the smaller of two chains wouldn't survive in the long run.  ""We expect the less popular chain to quickly lose support and be abandoned, which is why we have not invested a lot of resources into adding the capability to interact with both chains separately,"" the team said.    Name: Coinbase    Service: Wallet provider, exchange    Though the startup has indicated support in the past for efforts to raise the block size, Coinbase affirmed on 19th March that ""the only version of bitcoin supported on the Coinbase platform today is Bitcoin Core, currently represented by the symbol BTC.""  Coinbase echoed other services in saying that it may be required to temporarily suspend withdrawals and deposits in the event of a fork.  ""Customers who wish to access both blockchains at the time of the hard fork should withdraw their BTC from Coinbase since we cannot guarantee what will happen during the hard fork or when this access may be available,"" the startup added.    Name: GreenAddress    Service: Wallet provider    The team behind security-minded wallet GreenAddress said that they don't believe a fork will occur; however, like the other wallets, they outlined a brief game plan if it comes to pass.  ""We will always provide safe wallet support for Bitcoin under the original chain rules, as GreenAddress is server based and follows Bitcoin’s consensus rules. Users do not need to take any particular action at this time,"" the team said.  Exchanges  Bitcoin exchanges have been among the more active in seeking to define their policies ahead of the fork, largely embracing the idea of creating markets for both BTC and BTU should two blockchains emerge. That said, a policy rollout earlier this month laid bare the complexities to which the situation could lead.  Here’s what the exchanges have said thus far:    Name: Exchange Consortium    Signatories: Bitfinex, Bitso, Bitbank, Bitonic, Bitstamp, Bitsquare, Bittrex, Bitt, BTCC, Btcchina.com, Coincheck, Coinfloor, Kraken, QuadrigaCX, Ripio, ShapeShift, The Rock Trading Ltd and Zaif    A group of some well-known exchanges, including Bifinex, Bitstamp and Kraken, were the first to respond to a possible fork in bulk.  The plan indicates that the exchange expect to list the two tokens as separate assets, while allowing for the market to determine any winner.  ""Since it appears likely we may see a hard fork initiated by the Bitcoin Unlimited project, we have decided to designate the Bitcoin Unlimited fork as BTU (or XBU). The Bitcoin Core implementation will continue to trade as BTC (or XBT) and all exchanges will process deposits and withdrawals in BTC even if the BTU chain has more hashing power,"" the group has said.    Name: Poloniex    Service: Exchange    One of the more aggressive exchanges when it comes to listing new tokens, Poloniex emerged as an important market indicator.  Notably, it signaled it would be more cautious in listing any bitcoin fork.  ""We will support Bitcoin Core continuously as BTC,"" cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex said in its statement. ""In line with our current internal policy, if you have bitcoin on balance at the time of the fork, we will make Bitcoin Unlimited available for withdrawal provided it is safe to do so.""  Poloniex also outlined how it would define ""safe"", putting forward that it would be incumbent on the Bitcoin Unlimited team to guard against replay attacks (a concern that other exchanges have raised given the risk posed to user funds).  Such attacks featured in the aftermath of ethereum’s fork last summer when users were able to send transactions on both chains at once, leading to the loss of funds.    Name: BitMEX    Service: Futures exchange    In a notice,  futures exchange BitMEX endorsed the earlier statement by the exchange consortium. Notably, the company was uncompromising on the point of replay attacks.  ""BU will not be listed or used as a deposit/withdrawal currency until replay protection is implemented and BU is not at risk of a blockchain reorganization if the Core chain becomes longer,"" the company said.    Name: BitFlyer    Service: Exchange    The Japanese exchange indicated that it hopes the split will ultimately result in one bitcoin, whether it's one that uses Bitcoin Core or the Bitcoin Unlimited software.  Even so, BitFlyer plans to support both tokens in the event of a fork, while suggesting its services could be temporarily closed should this occur.  ""[W]e are strongly against the coexistence of multiple blockchains that would result from a hard fork,"" it said.  ""If a fork occurs, we may need to establish a time period during which no bitcoin operations, no bitcoin deposits, and no sending or receiving of bitcoin may be processed.""    Name: Gemini    Service: Exchange    In its statement  , Gemini was perhaps less decisive about how it would respond to a fork, writing that it ""may choose to eventually"" support the chain with less mining pool support.  ""The ‘BTC’ balance and trading activity you see on Gemini will likely reflect the chain with the greater total difficulty,"" the exchange said, adding:  ""We understand that our customers have diverse opinions on this subject, and we will do our best to incorporate your suggestions.""  Miners  Amidst the debate, bitcoin's miners – the entities that engage in a globally competitive, energy intensive race to add new transactions to the blockchain – have emerged as potential kingmakers.  Here’s what some of the miners in the space have said thus far:    Name: Bitmain    Service: Mining, ASIC development    In an interview with Bloomberg on 10th March, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu said that Bitmain’s mining pool, AntPool, would move to support Bitcoin Unlimited.  ""We will switch our entire pool to Bitcoin Unlimited,"" he told the publication. ""We can’t tell how the hard fork will play out. We will only know by the time we get there.""  The statement would go on to spark the largest, global discussion about a potential fork given AntPool's size and Bitmain's market position.    Name: BitFury    Service: Mining, ASIC development    In statements to CoinDesk, CEO Valery Vavilov said that his company supports the Segregated Witness upgrade put forward by Bitcoin Core.  Vavilov said that it offers exponentially ""more opportunities for transaction growth"" compared to Bitcoin Unlimited.  ""We will continue to work tirelessly to vigorously safeguard and secure the bitcoin blockchain that protects the interests of users and businesses around the world,"" said Vavilov.  ""We are going to continue to support the current agreed-upon consensus rules, and we will make our decision based on what protects users and protects businesses from attacks and losses.""    Name: ViaBTC    Service: Mining pool    ViaBTC has long backed the Bitcoin Unlimited project, and in a 24th March blog post pushed for other pools to integrate the software.  Further, the mining pool said that it disagreed with the idea of supporting two currencies with two distinct blockchains.  ""If the current blockchain hard forks into two chains, only one of them will be the valid bitcoin chain, which means there will only be one bitcoin, following the principles of Satoshi's white paper,"" said ViaBTC.  ""We will only support the scaling solution with the majority of consensus from the bitcoin community.""  Infrastructure  Finally, there's the startups and project teams that provide infrastructure services to the bitcoin blockchain, but that fall out of more common categories.  Here’s what some of them have said about the fork thus far:    Name: BitGo    Service: Security    In statements widely circulated by Bitcoin Core supporters, BitGo came out strongly on behalf of the project's existing development team.  ""BitGo considers any hard fork which is rolled out without industry-wide consensus, and therefore splits the network, to be an altcoin, not bitcoin itself,"" it read.    Name: Colu    Service: Local currency creation    As a provider of software that allows alternative currencies to be launched on the bitcoin blockchain, Colu is perhaps in a unique position when it comes to the possibility of a fork.  Ultimately, it reasoned that its customers would need to be clear about which infrastructure they would seek to base their service on, arguing they would need to select one of the two blockchains and communicate the choice to users.  More broadly, the company said it doesn't believe a block size fix is a panacea for bitcoins woes.  ""We are also confident that 'scaling' can’t be achieved by merely raising the block size, and right now the only viable solution we see for reaching scalability (and not short-term patches), while keeping Bitcoin’s features of censorship resistance , is moving transaction off-chain,"" it wrote.    Name: Counterparty    Service: Bitcoin protocol    Similar to Colu, Counterparty is a top-level bitcoin protocol that seeks to enable asset creation on top of the bitcoin network.  As such, while it lamented the ""increasing toxicity"" in bitcoin surrounding the debate, it noted that it would eventually have to base its service on one of the two blockchains (should they evolve into separate markets).  ""With whatever happens, we will not be maintaining two separate Counterparty networks, ever, but we keep the option open to switch from one to another if we can form a rough consensus in our community and we believe it is in the best interests of Counterparty users and developers,"" the statement read.    Name: Canadian ""Bitcoin Economic Nodes"" Group    Service: Multi-sector  Members: Honey Badger, Bitcoiniacs, Bitcoin Brains, Bitcoin Embassy Quebec, Bitcoin Outlet, Bylls, Coincards, Coinkite, Crypto Broker, Crypto Jeweler, Échange de Montréal, Jordan Samulaitis (individual broker), Satoshi Counter, Satoshi Portal, QuickBT, Yuri Yerofeyev (individual broker)    On 27th March, a group of Candian businesses and entreprenuers released a joint statement staunchly opposing Bitcoin Unlimited. The group said that they support the activation of Segregated Witness and opposed any hard forks that could result in a network split.  ""Under no circumstance will the current Bitcoin Unlimited proposal be considered by the undersigned to be the original Bitcoin cryptocurrency as described in the Satoshi whitepaper and as currently used under the denomination 'Bitcoin' in our businesses,"" the statement read.
