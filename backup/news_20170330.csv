42379369,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87c1V,1490904942,"Major Banks, Startups Advance Blockchain Syndicated Loan Pilot","A group of banks and financial firms led by Credit Suisse recently completed the second phase of a blockchain proof-of-concept focused on syndicated loans.  The system was developed Synaps, a joint venture backed by blockchain startup Symbiont and Ipreo, a fintech firm co-owned by Goldman Sachs and private equity giant Blackstone.  The demonstration drew a variety of finance firm as participants, including Barclays, BBVA, Danske Bank, LSTA, Royal Bank of Scotland, Scotiabank, Societe Generale, State Street Corporation, TenDelta LLC, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo. Buy-side companies AllianceBernstein, Eaton Vance Management, KKR, and Oak Hill Advisors took part in the trial as well. Distributed ledger startup R3's research outfit managed the test.  The effort, first announced in September, will continue with further refinement of the tech developed by Ipreo. Emmanuel Aidoo, who leads Credit Suisse's blockchain efforts, said that the bank intends to keep working closely on the initiative.  He said in a statement:  ""Over the coming months we will work with Symbiont and Ipreo to implement the remaining functions to allow for distributed ledger technology to support a syndicated loan facility from origination to payoff, and work toward market adoption. The technical and market expertise that the project participants brought to the table means this solution will be tailor-made for use in live transactions.""  Work on applying blockchain to the syndicated loan market – in which multiple lenders pool capital for single borrowers – has been pursued by other financial institutions as well. Last year, Japan-based Mizuho and Microsoft began work on a syndicated loan project.

Prices for the alternative cryptocurrency rose to as much as $7.04 on CoinMarketCap, compared to $4.18 at the start of trading – a rise of about 68%. According to the data, most of the trading has taken place on Poloniex, OKCoin and Huobi.  At press time, the price is averaging around $6.30 across exchanges.  Prior to today's rally, the digital currency had seen little price volatility since roughly the start of February. In that time, litecoin prices have fluctuated within a range close to $4, market data shows. Its price reached as much as $48 in late 2013.  As for what's driving the rally, market observers aren't so sure.  One theory floated related to efforts to integrate Segregated Witness – originally proposed as an upgrade to bitcoin's code – with litecoin, though figures show that adoption has been slow amongst the altcoin's miners.  At least one trader has expressed surprise in light of the rally. Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, told CoinDesk that he wasn't clear on what was causing prices to rise.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, offered a similar take, stating:  ""This move caught us totally by surprise.""  Another possible culprit: traders are simply chasing possible gains in the altcoin markets.  ""Traders have itchy trigger fingers after the recent market volatility and are looking to jump on moves and therefore exacerbate them,"" Hayter said.

42394595,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDTK7,1490888710,How Do Ethereum Smart Contracts Work?,"Smart contracts are tools that can automatically execute transactions if certain conditions are met without requiring the help of an intermediary company or entity. They are often associated with Ethereum, a blockchain that was designed to accommodate smart contracts, but the idea isn’t restricted to any particular platform or network.  Whether obvious or not, intermediaries permeate our digital lives. Even simply sharing a cat photo with friends online requires the services of an intermediary like Facebook or Twitter – a central authority that doesn’t just manage the network, but also set the rules and enforce their violation. Smart contracts make it possible to automate these digital tasks without needing a centralized entity to manage and approve the transaction.  Smart contracts aremade possible by blockchains, a network of computers that work together to enforce rules on the network without requiring the help of an intermediary.  With conventional contracts, a document outlines the terms of a relationship between two parties, which is enforceable by law. If one Party A violates the terms, Party B can take Party A to court for not complying with the agreement. A smart contract fortifies such agreements in code so the rules are automatically enforced without courts (or any third party) getting involved.  Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was created in 2013 specifically for creating smart contracts. To date, it is the most popular platform for doing so.  Smart contracts aren't widely used outside of Ethereum, and some are skeptical they'll ever achieve mainstream popularity as a way to manage transactions. Ethereum proponents, however, believe they could eventually become the norm for executing and securing online relationships.  Hundreds of apps that use smart contracts are already up and running. Popular Ethereum apps MakerDAO and Compound use smart contracts at their core for lending and allowing users to earn interest.  First conceived in 1993, the idea of a ""smart contract"" was originally described by computer scientist and cryptographer Nick Szabo as a kind of digital vending machine. In his famous example, he described how users could input $1, and receive anitem from a machine, in this case a snack or a soft drink.  Smart contracts are the same in that with a certain input (the $1), the user should be able to expect a certain outcome (the chosen drink).  In a simple example of an Ethereum smart contract, a user sends a friend 10 ether – the token native to Ethereum – but requires that it can't be dispersed until after a certain date using a smart contract.  Why Ethereum smart contracts?  The world's first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was the first to support basic smart contracts, although they are extremely limited in comparison with Ethereum. Each transaction is a smart contract because the network will only approve of the transactions if certain conditions are met – that the user provides a digital signature proving that they indeed own the cryptocurrency they claim to own. Only the owner of a Bitcoin private key can produce such a digital signature.  By contrast, Ethereum replaces Bitcoin’s more restrictive language, replacing it with language that allows developers to use the blockchain to process more than just cryptocurrency transactions. The language is ""Turing-complete,"" meaning it supports a broader set of computational instructions. Without limits, programmers can write just about any smart contract they can think of.  While this has obvious advantages, it also means that, because novel smart contracts are less tested, there is a higher chance of vulnerabilities. Ethereum has already seen millions of dollars of losses from exploited vulnerabilities in smart contracts.  Smart contract FAQs  What can smart contracts be used for?  Some common ways of using smart contracts are:  Multisignature accounts: Funds can only be spent when a required percentage of people agree.  Encoding financial agreements: Manage agreements between users. Say, if one person buys insurance from an insurance company, the rules of when the insurance can be redeemed can be programmed into a smart contract.  Agreements based on the outside world: Pull in data from the outside world (financial, political, or whatever) with the help of oracles.  Provide third party: Similar to how a software library works, smart contracts can work with other smart contracts in a chain.  Storage: Store information about an application, such as domain registration information or membership records. Storage in a blockchain like Ethereum is unique in that the data is immutable and can't be erased.  How can smart contracts work together?  Smart contracts aren’t intended to be used in isolation. Some smart contracts are built to assist other smart contracts.  When someone, say, places a simple bet on the temperature on a hot summer day via a smart contract, it might trigger a chain reaction of contracts under the hood. One contract would use outside data to determine the weather, and another contract could settle the bet based on the information it received from the first contract when the conditions are met.  With this in mind, smart contracts form the building blocks for decentralized applications and even whole companies, dubbed decentralized autonomous companies, which are controlled by smart contracts rather than human executives.  How is a smart contract set up?  A developer can create a smart contract by writing a slab of code – spelling out the rules, such as that 10 ether can only be retrieved by Alice 10 years from now.  The developer then pushes the smart contract to the Ethereum network, which is what enforces the contract – not allowing anyone to take the money unless they follow the exact rules in the code. Thousands of computers from around the world then all have a copy of this smart contract.  How do I use a smart contract?  Anyone can use smart contracts if they have Ethereum's native token ether, which can be bought on cryptocurrency exchanges.  Ethereum apps will usually provide instructions for how to use their specific app and underlying smart contracts. A common method is to use an Ethereum wallet tool, such as Metamask, to send the ether.  Users can use smart contracts for a range of use cases. Users can publish uncensorable posts to microblogging apps or lend out money without an intermediary, using a variety of Ethereum apps.  Do smart contracts cost anything?  Getting thousands of computers across the world to validate smart contracts often isn't cheap, though, as recent ballooning Ethereum fees highlight. The user must pay a fee, typically in ether (Ethereum’s native token), to keep the network up and running. Fees go up when the network grows more congested.  Are smart contracts legally enforced?  To many Ethereum advocates, smart contracts are intended to live outside of the legal system because they are enforced automatically. If they work as they're supposed to, users won't need to go to a court to settle conflicts.  That said, many wonder how these contracts would be treated under the current legal system. The answer is complicated. One 2018 research paper from partners Stuart D. Levi and Alex B. Lipton determined that U.S. law should recognize many smart contracts.  But, every country has a different legal approach to cryptocurrencies and blockchains, with some more accepting of the new technology than others.  Are smart contracts the future?  Many developers, researchers, and even lawyers and doctors are excited about the promises of smart contracts.  But it’s early days for smart contracts. While users of smart contracts don’t need to trust intermediaries, users must trust that the code was written correctly, which is a big ask seeing as there are still plenty of security issues. Many bug exploits have been unearthed over the years which allowed bad actors to steal user funds. The hope is these issues will grow rarer as the code matures.

42394593,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDTEz,1490888650,What Is a DAO?,"A decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, is a blockchain-based form of organization or company that is often governed by a native crypto token. Anyone who purchases and holds these tokens gains the ability to vote on important matters directly related to the DAO. They typically use smart contracts in place of traditional corporate structures to coordinate the efforts and resources of many towards common aims. These are self-executing computer programs that carry out a particular function when certain conditions are met.  Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and is the largest platform for using the technology behind cryptocurrency – blockchain – for uses beyond money. The thought is that if bitcoin can do away with middlemen in online payments, can the same or comparable technology do the same for middlemen in companies? What if entire organizations could exist without a central leader or CEO running the show?  Many consider DAOs to be one of the loftiest ideas stemming from Ethereum, and many argue the real-world realization of the idea will likely not lead to wise decision-making.  But others think the idea of an organization with decentralized control holds promise and are experimenting to bring it to life. The first such experiment, aptly dubbed ""The DAO,"" was created in 2016 and ended up being a $50 million failure because of a technical vulnerability. However, organizations like Aragon, Colony, MakerDAO and others are picking up where The DAO left off.  A driverless car as a DAO  Imagine this: a driverless car cruises around in a ridesharing role, essentially an autonomous Uber. Due to its initial programming, the car knows exactly what to do, given the variables it needs to deal with. It finds passengers, transports them, and accepts payments for its transportation services.  After dropping someone off, the car uses its profits for a trip to an electric charging station, using ether – Ethereum's native token used for paying to use decentralized apps – to pay for the electricity.  This car is just one in a fleet of vehicles owned by a DAO. As the cars earn ether, the money goes back to the shareholders that have invested in the entity.  That’s one “thought experiment” brought to you by former bitcoin contributor Mike Hearn in which he describes how cryptocurrency and blockchains could help power leaderless organizations in the future. What Hearn described is one fanciful use case for a DAO, an idea that began to get traction in the crypto community not long after bitcoin was released in 2009.  DAO FAQ  Why run a company with code?  One inherent advantage of DAOs, advocates argue, is that they enable the building of fairer organizations than the human-run kind.  Most companies today have leaders who sometimes make unilateral decisions that affect the entire company. A DAO would make this kind of decision-making impossible; stakeholders (i.e. investors in the company) have more direct control over how the company should operate.  How does a DAO work?  In short, DAOs aim to hard-code certain rules to drive the company or organization from the get-go.  DAOs are based on Ethereum smart contracts, which can be programmed to carry out certain tasks only when certain conditions are met. These smart contracts can be programmed to automatically execute typical company tasks, such as disbursing funds only after a certain percentage of investors agree to fund a project.  Many see DAOs as a way to more rigorously guarantee democracy. Stakeholders can vote on adding new rules, changing the rules or ousting a member, to name a few examples. And the DAO simply won't be able to change unless the required threshold of people vote for the change.  Some proposed characteristics of a DAO include:  No hierarchy: There's often no hierarchical management. Stakeholders usually make decisions instead of leaders or managers.  Transparent: The code is open source, meaning anyone can look at it. On the blockchain, anyone can scan through the history to see how decisions were made.  Open access: Anyone with internet access could hold DAO tokens or buy them, thus giving them decision-making power in the DAO.  Democratic changes: Investors can change the rules of a DAO by voting on new proposals.  Recruiting: A DAO could even theoretically hire outside talent, since there are still tasks that only humans can do. For example, the driverless car in the DAO described above could automatically hire a repairman, based on sensors reporting to the DAO when damages occur.  Has a DAO been tried before?  Yes. The best-known attempt at creating such an organization was aptly called “The DAO.”  Launched in 2016, The DAO failed in a matter of months, but it’s still the preeminent example of what people have in mind when they talk about the technology.  The plan was for investors in The DAO to receive tokens proportional to how much ether they invested in the project. With those tokens they could vote for which projects to fund. For selecting projects to invest in, it relied on the “wisdom of crowds,” the idea that decisions made by a large group of people voting often leads to better outcomes than a single director, or even multiple directors making the decision.  If the projects that were invested in profited, the profits would be distributed back to the investors.  Why did The DAO fail?  It’s easy to see why “unstoppable code” can pose a security problem.  That was the problem with The DAO. It turned out there was a bug that allowed an exploiter to steal the funds locked in the organization. Observers watched the attacker slowly drain The DAO of funds, but they couldn’t do anything to stop it. Technically, the hacker was following the rules as they were deployed.  Ethereum’s lead coders reversed the transaction history to return funds to their owners – a controversial decision that led to a rift in the community. The best way to handle a similar situation in the future is still up to debate.  What are some problems with DAOs?  As shown with The DAO, unstoppable code can pose a problem. It’s difficult to change the rules of the DAO once it’s deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. The same framework that prevents a person or entity from altering the organization without consensus from the community can also cause problems, the main one being that any gaps in the framework aren’t easily closed. That can lead to potential theft, money loss or other disastrous consequences.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-dao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/325147b70dc53903705b5e2d677e6e816773e5e2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394597,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDTed,1490888586,What Is a Decentralized Application?,"Decentralized applications (also known as “dapps”) provide services similar to those offered by typical consumer applications, but they use blockchain technology to grant users more control over their data by eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries to manage the data, thus making the service “decentralized.”  Digital apps are ubiquitous in today’s world. Consumers use apps for sending email, paying for parking, finding dates and myriad other use cases. Under conventional models of control and ownership, consumers usually hand over personal data to the company providing the service. With a decentralized app, users theoretically gain more control over their finances and personal data since they don't have to trust anyone else to store and secure the information. However, some experts are skeptical this will work in practice.  One of the main goals of the founders of Ethereum, the platform that supports the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, is to make these kinds of apps easier to create. There are many challenges in trying to reach this goal.  But there has been progress. Hundreds of dapps exist today on Ethereum, ranging from a Twitter replacement to a decentralized virtual reality game. Many are slow and difficult to use, but they give a taste of the potential for decentralized apps in the long term. Developers hope Ethereum 2.0, a long-awaited upgrade that officially started being rolled out on Dec. 1, 2020, will ease these problems in the coming years.  How does a dapp work?  Dapps built on Ethereum use blockchain technology under the hood to connect users directly. Blockchains are a way to tie together a distributed system, where each user has a copy of the records. With blockchains under the hood, users don't have to go through a third party, meaning they don't have to give up control of their data to someone else.  By their nature, centralized entities have power of the data that flows into and out of their networks. For example, financial entities can stop transactions from being sent, and Twitter can delete tweets from its platform. Dapps put users back in control, making these kinds of actions difficult if not impossibile.  There isn’t one agreed-upon definition of a dapp as it’s a relatively new concept. But the key characteristics of a dapp include:  Open source: The code is public for anyone to look at, copy and audit.  Decentralized: Dapps don’t have anyone in charge, so no central authority can stop users from doing what they want on the app.  Blockchains: If there isn't a central entity, then what's holding the app together? Dapps use an underlying blockchain (such as Ethereum) to coordinate instead of a central entity.  Smart contracts: Decentralized applications use Ethereum smart contracts, which automatically executes certain rules.  Global: The goal is for anyone in the world to be able to publish or use these dapps.  What are dapps used for?  The Ethereum white paper published by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin in 2013 splits dapps into three main types:  Financial apps: These are applications where money is involved.  Semi-financial apps: Decentralized apps that involve money, but also require another piece, such as data from outside the Ethereum blockchain.  Other apps: Every other type of decentralized app developers are looking to create, including online voting and storage apps.  Financial applications  Financial applications are popularly known as DeFi applications, short for ""decentralized finance.""  The idea is to use blockchains (especially Ethereum) to improve more complex financial applications – such aslending, wills and insurance – and stablecoins, alternative coins that aim to stabilize cryptocurrency prices.  Semi-financial apps  The second type of app is similar, but it mixes money with ""a heavy non-monetary side"" as Buterin puts it in the Ethereum white paper.  Buterin gives the example of Ethereum developers setting up ""bounties,"" rewards that can only be unlocked if someone accomplishes a task. In western movies, bounties are doled out to outlaws able to catch a person or criminal. But, in this case, they are rewarded for far less dangerous tasks, such as solving a difficult computational problem.  The magic here is the smart contract is (in theory) able to tell if the bounty hunter has provided a working solution, only disbursing the funds if this condition is met.  Another example is a crop insurance application that’s dependent on an outside weather feed. Say a farmer buys a derivative that automatically pays out if a drought wipes out her crops.  These smart contracts rely on so-called “oracles” that relay up-to-date information about the outside world, like how many inches of rain fell last season.  The major caveat, though, is that many developers are skeptical oracles can be used in a decentralized way. Users have to trust that the data feed is providing the correct data, and not gaming the data for their own financial interest.  Other applications: DAOs and beyond  Ethereum is a flexible platform, so developers are dreaming up other ideas that don't fit into the usual financial classifications.  One example is to use this approach to create a decentralized social network that’s resistant to censorship. Most mainstream social apps, such as Twitter, censor some posts, and some critics argue those social apps apply inconsistent standards about what content is censored or “downranked.”  So, with a decentralized app like Peepeth, once you publish a message to the blockchain, it can’t be erased, not even by the company that built the platform. It will live on Ethereum forever.  Some have explored taking this idea of decentralization even further. If Bitcoin can do away with financial authorities, is it possible to do the same for companies and other types of organizations?  Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are one particularly ambitious breed of dapp that attempts to answer “yes” to that question. The goal is to form a leaderless company by programming rules at the beginning about how members can join, vote, how to release company funds and more. Once launched, the DAO would operate under these rules indefinitely.  What challenges do dapps face?  Dapps are early, experimental, and developers have yet to solve several crucial problems with the underlying network holding them back. For one, dapps can be very expensive to run when Ethereum grows more congested with users. Although traditional apps sometimes have issues with scale, those issues are exacerbated in a decentralized environment, which by its nature can’t operate without a certain level of cooperation and coordination among multiple stakeholders.  How do developers create decentralized apps?  Ethereum developers have created many low-level coding tools, like smart contract builder Truffle and Web3, a way to interact with Ethereum with the popular programming language Javascript, so developers from around the world can experiment with dapps in an effort to turn the dream into reality.

42394594,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDT4j,1490888411,Who Created Ethereum?,"Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian entrepreneur and programmer from Toronto, first envisioned Ethereum when he was 19-years-old.  In 2011, the year Buterin first grew interested in Bitcoin, Buterin co-founded the online news website Bitcoin Magazine, writing hundreds of articles on the cryptocurrency world. He went on to code for the privacy-minded Dark Wallet and the marketplace Egora.  Along this journey, he came up with the idea of Ethereum, a platform inspired by Bitcoin, but that could go beyond the financial use cases.  He released a white paper in 2013 describing an alternative platform that would allow developers to create their own decentralized applications using a built-in programming language. Many developers were drawn to this idea because these new applications would be accessible to a global audience, highly secure, and much faster to build because there are no intermediary services to integrate.  To accomplish this, Ethereum makes it easy to create smart contracts, code that automatically creates an outcome when certain conditions are met. For his work, Buterin was also named a 2014 Thiel fellow, winning a $100,000 grant to work on Ethereum.  FAQs  Who helped Buterin create Ethereum?  After Buterin unveiled the Ethereum white paper, several other developers joined the ranks including CEO of IOG Charles Hoskinson, Decentral CEO Anthony Di Iorio and Akasha Founder Mihai Alisie. Buterin also introduced two new members to the team:  Co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood did much of the early programming and architecting of the platform. He wrote the Ethereum yellow paper, the “technical bible” that outlines the specification for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is responsible for handling the state of the ledger and runs smart contracts.  Co-founder Joseph Lubin went on to found the Brooklyn-based ConsenSys, a startup that focuses on building decentralized apps.  How much money does Buterin have?  Since Ethereum data and transaction information is public, users can track how much money Buterin has stored in ether, Ethereum's native token.  Buterin's main address is this one, which shows that he owns 333,348 ether, worth approximately $405million at the time this article was published.  What was Ethereum like in its early days?  To get the project off the ground, Buterin and the other founders launched a crowdfunding campaign in July 2014 where participants purchased ether, the Ethereum tokens that function as shares in the project.  Raising more than $18m, it was the most successful crowdsale at that time. It took another year, but the first live release, Frontier, launched on 30th July, 2015. It wasn’t a particularly attractive platform, but the command line interface offered developers a platform for creating their own decentralized apps.  The smart contract platform took off, swelling into today’s ecosystem of hundreds of developers and even drawing the attention of tech giants like IBM and Microsoft.  The funds from Ethereum’s initial $18m crowd sale and project development are now managed by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit entity based in Zug, Switzerland.

42394588,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwDSZx,1490888374,How to Use Ethereum,"Ethereum apps aim to give people more control over their online data. Using these apps is a matter of learning how to buy, store, and use its native token, ether.  If the Ethereum protocol, sometimes called the “world computer,” develops as its proponents expect, it could provide alternatives to tech platforms, such as Facebook and Google, that many people have come to depend on. Generally, those alternatives would give users more control over their digital information.  However, this control comes at a cost: ether. Every action on an Ethereum app, even as small as posting a short message to a microblogging platform, costs a little bit of ether. With ether fees, users can tap into a variety of apps on the platform.  These apps, also known as decentralized apps (dapps), are not free because the computing resources of the Ethereum platform are limited. The more people using the platform, the higher the fees. Since the number of services that interact with Ethereum right now is relatively high, so are the fees.  In this regard, Ethereum is still a work in progress. A network upgrade, Ethereum 2.0, is gradually being phased in to tackle Ethereum's underlying scalability issues. That will theoretically push fees lower while bolstering the security of the network.  Ethereum apps might not be as intuitive as the apps we use today, but anyone with a computer or smartphone can access them, as long as they have ether.  What is an Ethereum wallet?  Before we get some ether, we need a place to put it. This brings us to the idea of an Ethereum ""wallet."" Like its real-world counterpart, an ethereum wallet is made for storing value. (It is common practice to use lower case for ""ethereum"" or ""ether"" when referring to the currency, but upper for the network or protocol.)  Most wallets are digital apps that can be accessed from a smartphone or laptop. Furthermore, these digital wallets store digital money in the form of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.  Ethereum wallets store a user's private keys, which are secret keys that can be used to access ether. Each key is a unique long and jumbled string of letters and numbers that looks like this:  073d9dbee8875e7c91422d80413c85ba5e8e9fe7cad5dc001871dac882d07f2f  Only the owners of the private keys can use them to spend the money associated with them. These days, ethereum wallets  There are several types of Ethereum wallets made specifically for storing these private keys:  Desktop wallets  Mobile wallets  Hardware wallets  Paper wallets  Choosing one depends on your preferences for convenience and security. Usually these two concepts are at odds with one another: the more convenient, the worse the security (and vice versa).  When it comes to cryptocurrency wallets, there’s one major caveat to keep in mind: losing your private key means losing your ether, forever. It is a much bigger deal than misplacing a password for an online service. This is where the absence of trusted third parties becomes a double-edged sword. While intermediaries are no longer needed to verify transactions, there’s no help desk to turn to for help recovering your secret key.  Desktop and mobile wallets  Desktop wallets run on a PC or laptop, while some wallets are more portable and can be run on a smartphone. Some wallets offer both.  Desktop, mobile, and web wallets can be either:  Custodial: Custodial wallets take care of your private key, which is like a password to your money. This is an easy option for users who are new to Ethereum or worried about losing their private key. However, with this type of wallet, users are still relying on a third party, which poses its own risks. These entities can get hacked, for instance.  Non-custodial: With non-custodial wallets, you and only you are in control of your private key.  Because desktop and mobile wallets are running on a laptop or smartphone that's connected to the internet, they're less secure. As such, experts suggest keeping only a little money in them. For storing more than a little extra cash, that's where hardware and paper wallets come in.  Hardware wallets  Hardware wallets, electronic devices that are often as small as a thumb, offer more security. These devices are built for security and detached from the internet, and can sign and send ether transactions without being online. This is more secure because it is much harder to hack and is best used for storing large ether holdings.  Ledger and Trezor are two popular hardware wallets that can be used for holding ether.  Paper wallets  Another cold storage option is to print or carefully handwrite a private key on a slip of paper, a ""paper wallet,"" and lock it somewhere secure like a safety deposit box.  MyEthereumWallet, or MEW, is one popular service for generating key pairs directly on your computer – not on a website’s servers. Storing private keys on a server would mean trusting the company with access to your private keys, essentially a custodial wallet (see above). It would also leave those keys vulnerable if the site is ever hacked.  Tech-savvy users can generate keys using the command-line interface on a regular computer, which is used to directly input commands via text, provided they have the necessary cryptographic packages installed.  All that said, it bears repeating that if you lose your private key, it — and any ether associated with it — is gone for good. The best practice is to spend some extra time creating multiple copies of the private key and stashing them in different secure locations, in case one is lost or destroyed.  How can I buy ether?  The easiest way to obtain ether varies by location.  There are several methods to buy ether:  A centralized exchange  A compatible ATM  Buying in person or via a peer-to-peer marketplace that connects users directly to one another  Finding an online ether exchange  Buying ether via a centralized exchange is usually the easiest option.  Popular exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken allow users to buy ether directly with dollars or bitcoin. Typically there’s a sign-up process. These exchanges usually comply with Know-Your-Customer (KYC) laws, meaning they need to confirm a user's identity before they can buy cryptocurrencies from the platform.  Buying ether with a currency other than the dollar might take an extra step.  Bitcoin is the most commonly used cryptocurrency, and people around the world are more likely to want to trade for it in their currency. So if you want to buy ether for Russian rubles, for instance, one easy option is to purchase bitcoin at an exchange and then trade that for ether.  That said, the official Ethereum website provides a list of buying options based on the country you reside in.  Ether ATMs  There are also hundreds of ether ATMs dotting the globe. This map from CoinATMRadar shows where these ATMs are located.  ATMs are less convenient since they can only be used in person, but they do offer a couple of advantages. While exchanges accept only digital forms of payment (such as credit cards), ATMs accept cash. Sometimes exchanges take a couple of days to send a user their ether, but ATMs are instantaneous.  Buying ether in person  Some users are privacy-conscious and would rather not use centralized exchanges, which often require a form of ID to use.  For these users, there’s always the option of meeting in person to buy or sell ether, and some cities have frequent Ethereum meetups, including New York and Toronto. However, this isn’t always an easy option in less populated areas.  Sites such as LocalCryptos connect users who want to trade by another peer-to-peer method, including directly by way of a bank transfer.  What can I do with ether?  What can users do once they have ether?  Once you have ether, you canuse it to fueldecentralized apps (often called ""dapps""), which are often similar to apps we use today, except they aim to cut intermediaries out of the picture.  These dapps are built from Ethereum smart contracts, code that automatically executes the terms of an agreement so that users don’t have to rely on a third party to enforce the rules.  Examples of decentralized applications include:  CryptoKitties: A game for collecting and breeding funny looking digital cats. Ethereum's innovation is that it allows users more control of their digital collectibles. For instance, the digital cat cannot be deleted, unlike in other games, where the collectibles only survive as long as the company that created them.  PeepEth: PeepEth is a decentralized Twitter alternative. Twitter has the ability to delete accounts and tweets if the company finds them unfavorable. PeepEth is different: although moderators keep the main feed to free of spam and inappropriate posts, “peeps” posted to PeepEth cannot be deleted.  DeFi: decentralized finance (DeFi) is the term for the array of financial applications built on top of ethereum.  Some Ethereum apps have their own token, derived from ether. To participate in these, users need to trade ether for the token powering the app. For instance, Decentraland is a virtual world where users can buy virtual plots of land. It's different from games that don't use blockchain because users control the game, rather than a central entity.  Aggregator State of the Dapps lists nearly 3,000 such Ethereum dapps. While many are promising services and projects, sending ether to unvetted apps is not recommended.

The round was led by MAIF Avenir, an arm of French insurance giant MAIF. Others taking part in the Series A round include Xange, Wicklow Capital, GDTRE, Libertus Capital, Digital Currency Group, The Whittemore Collection, Kima Ventures, BHB Network, and investor Nicolas Pinto.  Ledger, which makes hardware for users to store and maintain control over their cryptocurrency private keys, plans to use that funding to expand its reach into the enterprise market. Notably, the startup intends to open a new factory in China as part of its hardware push, with an eye on a launch sometime in the next few months.  Co-founder Eric Larchevêque told CoinDesk:  ""We hope that everything will be operational in May.""  The new round comes more than two years after Ledger raised €1.3m in seed funding. In that time, the startup has moved to release wallets that support other cryptocurrencies and, in November, launched the Ledger Blue, a departure from its previous thumb drive-style aesthetic.  Ledger now plans to expand its reach into the enterprise space, with an eye to bring larger companies into its customer base – Larchevêque said he hopes to have the first beta customers in place by the end of June. The startup is also looking to grow its sales figures for the year, aiming to sell 100,000 units in 2017.  MAIF, which led the round, said it invested in the startup as a means to contribute to more confidence and security in cryptocurrency transactions.

The partnership will see Chain bridging its enterprise-focused blockchain software capabilities with the nShield hardware security module (HSM) developed by Thales. The move comes shortly after Thales unveiled a blockchain offering in conjunction with professional services firm Accenture.  Thales’ HSM is a hardware solution for securely storing private keys – the all-important strings of data that, for example, protect a user's bitcoin or other blockchain-tied token. As these pieces of information are critical in the context of digital asset management, the hardware offering has been positioned as one that would alleviate security concerns among enterprises and other organisations.  Jon Geater, CTO for Thales' cybersecurity arm, said in a statement:  ""Blockchain is a game-changer in the financial services industry, with the potential to enhance security, speed and operational efficiency. Our integration with Chain provides a strong root of trust and ensures the integrity of the underlying blockchain operations that enables organizations to build, deploy, and operate blockchain-based transaction networks with confidence.""  Regulators are also likely to cheer the advance of security measures in the blockchain space.  In February, the European Securities and Markets Authority proclaimed that distributed ledger technology regulations would be premature, given the state of the tech and a lack of market-wide cybersecurity standards.

42379359,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87Z8r,1490873415,Market Enabler? Exchanges See Blockchain as New Revenue Play,"While distributed ledgers were once considered a way for financial firms to upgrade back-office processes, some appear to be changing their tune on the tech.  At the World Exchange Congress in Budapest this week, representatives from global exchanges met to discuss market issues, with speakers including representatives from the Central Bank of Hungary, CME Europe and the variety of regional operations that power global trading.  Blockchain, while not high on the agenda, was a frequent topic of conversation and confusion among attendees, with some making eager pitches for the technology and others balking at its overwhelming hype.  Still, in side presentations and roundtables, there emerged the idea that distributed ledger tech is perhaps ill-suited for use cases that would spur cost savings, and that exchanges should consider it first as a way to explore new market opportunities.  Ted Pendleton, senior vice president at blockchain solution provider AlphaPoint, wasn't shy about promoting this view. He argued in his presentation that revenue-generating opportunities are the best way for organizations to not only test, but gain from the technology.  Pendleton told attendees:  ""I'll be very blunt about this, it's perfectly acceptable to use blockchain in over-the-counter derivatives, but I think there are faster opportunities.""  Pendleton went on to explain how an exchange could use blockchain to open a market that digitized the trading of a new asset, such as the chemical element lithium, a market he projected as an opportunity worth up to $30m.  ""Very much like the physical world, you're able to gather together producers in a single chain and start generating revenue,"" he continued.  On stage, there was a similar agreement.  Cees Vermaas, CEO of CME Europe, didn't mention blockchain directly, but alluded to his firm's work with the technology in a keynote speech that addressed how the commodities giant is approaching digitization and included mention of its ongoing pilot with the UK's Royal Mint.  ""This is one of the reasons why at CME Group we are working with the Royal Mint on digitizing gold. The right level of dialogue and technologies can minimizes risk and cost will maximizing workable innovation,"" Vermaas said.  Other representatives that discussed blockchain included David Janczewski, head of strategic marketing at the Royal Mint; Sergey Putyatinskiy, CIO at the National Settlement Depository; and Kraken COO David Ripley.  New directions  Elsewhere, a blockchain roundtable discussion hosted by US tech consulting firm EPAM saw heated discussion on the direction of the technology.  There, Balazs Fejes, an SVP at the firm, outlined five use cases he believes exchanges should consider, including settlement, over-the-counter trading and proxy voting. Yet, the idea these existing processes could be optimized by the tech was challenged by vocal and outspoken participants.  Sergei Poliakoff, CIO at Moscow Exchange, for example, argued that exchanges should be looking to blockchain as a way to ""break their own business model"", questioning its use as a ""complicated distributed database"" at all.  Instead, he argued exchanges would be best advised to pursue new markets such as crowdfunding, energy trading and property trading.  ""We should look for transactions that have never had central counterparties, where the core finance built on the correspondent relation is untouched by any of this,"" he said.  In this light, Fejes made the case for loyalty points as an example of a market that could benefit from new exchange services powered by distributed ledger tech.  Risky markets  Still, there were signs that the idea that back-office processes would be disrupted by the tech isn't going away entirely.  Indeed, the potential impact of a unified blockchain that resembles the internet in its scope and ease of access was perhaps most visible in sessions that didn't address the tech at all.  For example, a panel on challenges in the African exchange market saw discussion on how regional exchanges suffer from poor liquidity, but have also been unable to unite their order books despite attempts over the years.  Elsewhere, challenges in opening access to less trafficked global exchanges was presented in a panel on 'market classifications'. There, index providers and emerging markets shed light on the complex process by which exchanges are graded and ranked for investors.  Pendleton, too, spoke to the discrepancy in technologies between developing and developed markets as an example of the path forward for blockchain in the back office.  ""We all live in the western world, where the response is, 'Don't touch my billion dollar database',"" he said. ""Other markets are starting new.""  Others argued that the upgrade to such systems was necessary to reduce the risk to the global financial system as a whole, one that faces new cyberthreats.  Despite his skepticism on database use cases, Poliakoff made perhaps the most impassioned pitch for blockchain's benefits in remarks that showcase how a long-term vision is still powering exploration of the tech.  ""Cybersecurity will be the biggest driver. Cyberthreat is not a threat anymore, it's a War on Drugs or War on Terrorism,"" he said, adding:  ""The only way to live with that is to distribute vital portions of our infrastructure. I think that's the biggest push for DLT.""

42379389,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87YwH,1490867974,Sweden Moves to Next Stage With Blockchain Land Registry,"A project set up last year by Sweden’s land registry authority, the Lantmäteriet, to trial blockchain technology for recording property deals has just moved to its second phase.  Conducted by blockchain startup ChromaWay and consultancy group Kairos Future, the initiative is also working in partnership with two banks: SBAB and Landshypotek.  “It could be a great benefit for economic growth,” said ChromaWay CEO Henrik Hjelte on the project's potential, further arguing that Sweden is the ideal place to test a blockchain system for land titles, as trust in public authorities is high and could influence agencies elsewhere to follow suit.  Under the proposed system, a buyer and seller would open a contract where banks and the land registry can view the workflow of the deal, such as due dates for payments.  “In the blockchain confirmation of each step in the workflow is made with a hash, like the blockchain normally,” said Magnus Kempe of Kairos Future, adding: “Everyone has the same information and you can check it yourself.”  Another use example is verifying the existence of the IOU issued by the bank to the property buyer.  “That part is going to be hidden for the others in the contract. You will only have the hash confirming from the bank that the IOU has been signed,” said Kempe.  The newly entered second phase involves examining how the technology can be integrated with banks’ existing processes when verifying contracts. The firms indicated that ChromaWay’s platform won’t be handling any payments on the system – those will remain separate.  SBAB Bank however said it has no immediate plans to implement the tech, saying:  ""Our reason to participate in the project has not been to actually implement the solution in our current processes. But rather an opportunity for us to get a better understanding of the blockchain technology and how it might possibly fit in our future products/offerings.""  Trusting the digital  There remains one major hurdle to fully integrating this blockchain system for selling a house from start to finish.  “We want to work fully digitally, but the law requires, at the moment, physical signatures on the papers, which makes it difficult,” explained Kempe.  While trust in digital contracts has been lagging for a long time, he argued that blockchain tech can now provide the trust needed to move forward.  “As soon as the legislator understands that this is possible, I think it will come true,” said Kempe.  Helping that process, the EU passed a directive in 2016 that puts more weight behind digital signatures and could eventually influence Swedish policy.  For now, the land registry project is looking at ways of working around the issue. Kempe said:  “Actually, the land registry today, they don’t receive much physical paper, they get PDFs of the contracts which are signed electronically so they don’t store the physical contracts. What we are thinking of is, you can actually sign the contract digitally in the blockchain to the land registry, they can award the land titles and then you can throw away the paper so you’re not dependent on the physical archive.""  Outside interest  ChromaWay and Kairos Future said that they have been approached by more than a dozen public authorities from other countries expressing interest in the project.  The team explained that they don’t hold any patents for the platform, preferring to see other organizations work on similar schemes, eventually leading to more collaboration.  Sweden’s testing of the blockchain for land titles is possibly the most ambitious application of the technology in real estate thus far. Others are working on the concept, however. Early last year, the land registry authorities in Eurasian nation Georgia began working with blockchain startup BitFury, which, in February, signed a memorandum of understanding to extend the tests to other government agencies.  According to ChromaWay’s Henrik Hjelte, the use of blockchain could be transformative for developing countries in managing ownership of property and improving transparency in real estate sales.  On the other hand, proof-of-concept tests in Honduras were put on the back-burner in late 2015 over an apparent breakdown in communications between the government and Factom, the company that was supposed to conduct the trials.  ChromaWay and Kairos Future are confident about the future, though. Kempe said:  “There’s very little reason to think that this won’t work.""
