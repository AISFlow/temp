42427622,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWwFh,1498514893,European Banks Select IBM Blockchain for Small Business Trade Finance,"A group of seven major European banks is working with IBM to build a new blockchain-based trade finance platform for small- and medium-sized enterprises.  IBM will build and host the platform for the Digital Trade Chain Consortium (made up of seven banks including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Rabobank, Societe General and Unicredit), with the goal of facilitating easier and more transparent domestic and cross-border trade for smaller businesses.  The platform will be built on the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Fabric blockchain and will run on the IBM Cloud.  ""What we'll be building is a user interface that the banks will make available through their environment to the end SME clients, for the buying SME and the selling SME. The bank will be responsible for onboarding, KYC, all those aspects associated with the client relationship,"" Keith Bear, VP of global financial services at IBM, told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""The bank will then be running nodes within the business network, which for most of them will be facilitated by our cloud environment.""  The forthcoming blockchain solution is being designed to reduce transaction costs and increase transparency for SMEs. Citing figures from the World Bank, Bear said that up to 50% of SMEs don’t have to access formal credit channels.  In this light, the blockchain solution will be the first step in addressing this financing gap for small businesses.  ""It's a large and important marketplace, but it's not really well served by trade finance capabilities,"" said Bear. ""That could clearly be an inhibitor to them being able to trade internationally and potentially domestically as well.""  The solution is currently in development with a plan to go into implementation by the end of 2017.

42427635,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWwfh,1498510089,Crypto Correction: Bitcoin and Ether Dive as Market Sheds $13 Billion,"Is the long-awaited 'crypto correction' finally here?  There was certainly ample evidence to suggest the answer was yes today, as cryptocurrencies both large and small suffered widespread losses, a decline that analysts attributed to profit taking from veteran investors.  Overall, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell to as little as $91.4bn today, a more than 20% decline from the all-time high of $117.2bn it reached around mid-June, and down over 13% from the day's open at $105.3bn.  At the time of report, the top 20 cryptocurrencies as ranked by market capitalization had all suffered declines in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of leveraged cryptocurrency platform CryptoCompare, asserted in his comments that the decline was evidence of how hype had impacted the markets of late.  With media outlets portraying the market as one driven by easy gains, investors drawn to the space, he said, did not know ""what they were getting into"".  He said of the day's events:  ""A correction of sorts was [in] the cards.""  At press time, bitcoin was down 7% on the day's trading, while ether, the digital asset that powers the ethereum blockchain, was down nearly 20%.  Profit taking  Other traders echoed Hayter's comments that traders were showing an appetite for profit taking.  Brad Chun, chief investment officer of Shuttle Fund Advisor, pointed to profit taking, emphasizing that he believes veteran traders are using the decline to lock in gains made in the previous weeks.  In addition to taking this specific action, some traders have been rebalancing their portfolios as of late, analysts told CoinDesk.  ""People are taking cryptos off the table for fiat cash,"" Hayter told CoinDesk.  Investor and crypto hedge fund manager Tim Enneking offered further detail, emphasizing that while some traders stick to cryptocurrencies, others trade fiat currencies as well, a factor that could have played a role.  He said:  ""Some people trade only crypto; others trade both, and this may be a time to diversify.""  Another factor that a handful of traders pointed out was that cryptocurrencies sometimes follow each other in terms of their price movements.  Hayter emphasized the key role played by momentum, telling CoinDesk: ""Markets move in sync and when selling is the main momentum driver – traders follow the leader.""  While cryptocurrencies don't always move in tandem, they appear to have moved together today.  ""We are witnessing the still strong correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" Enneking observed. ""When bitcoin sees a large move down, as we've seen in the past 48 hours, it still has a tendency to take the entire rest of the market with it"".  The end of the rally?  While the cryptocurrency has suffered a pullback lately, this may not be the last we have seen of the rally in these digital assets, traders told CoinDesk.  Even after reaching today's low of $91.4bn, the market cap of all cryptocurrencies is up more than 400% year-to-date.  After experiencing such sharp gains, it is ""healthy"" for cryptocurrencies to ""take a pause,"" Enneking told CoinDesk.  Redwood City Ventures founder Sean Walsh perhaps best summed up the optimistic mood, concluding:  ""All investments, even the good ones like [cryptocurrencies], have a respiration rate. They tend to 'breathe' periodically during their inexorable upward march in price, and outward march in adoption.""

42427634,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWwdh,1498497914,GDAX Exchange to Reimburse Traders After Ether Flash Crash,"GDAX, the digital asset exchange operated by Coinbase, is moving to issue refunds after a stunning flash crash last week stoked anger amongst affected traders.  Ether prices dramatically plunged to $13 on GDAX amid a broader market decline on Wednesday. The fall triggered a margin call, liquidating positions held by leveraged traders, though the price soon bounced back above the $300 level at the time.  Coinbase ultimately opted to disable trading of the ETH/USD pair and temporarily block withdrawals of ether while it moved to investigate the situation.  In an update that followed on its official blog, GDAX said that it planned to honor every transaction, stating that no no technical issue with its system was found.  Yet in a follow-up blog post published two days later, Coinbase vice president Adam White reiterated the startup's position that the platform functioned as intended, but acknowledged that ""however, some customers did not receive the quality of service we strive to provide and we want to do better"".  White wrote:  ""For customers who had buy orders filled — we are honoring all executed orders and no trades will be reversed. For affected customers who had margin calls or stop loss orders executed - we are crediting you using company funds.""  Thus far, the degree of loss involved (and the exact amount that will be compensated) remains unknown.  The decision to refund users came amid growing complaints from Coinbase users – who alleged that the situation was exacerbated by a lack of accessibility to the exchange during the volatile period – and calls for legal action to recoup losses.  Despite largely recovering, the price of ether has fallen since last week's crash. At press time, the price of ether is $248.

42427628,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWwTh,1498494319,Proof-of-Life: Vitalik Buterin Uses Ethereum to Disprove Death Hoax,"Vitalik Buterin, the creator of ethereum, used the technology he developed in an unusual way this weekend, turning to the blockchain network itself to disprove his own death.  The hoax originated on the 4chan internet forum yesterday, with posts stating that Buterin had died in a car crash. The story was picked up by at least one online news site, VioNews, though the article and a corresponding tweet were later removed once the story was revealed to be false.  Amidst the rumors, Buterin ultimately took to social media to prove that he was, in fact still alive, posting an ethereum block number and corresponding hash.  It was a move that echoed one taken by Wikileaks founder Julian Assange who, amidst rumors of his own demise, turned to the bitcoin blockchain as a ""proof of life"" tool during a Reddit Ask-Me-Anything session in January.  Word that Buterin had died, however, had an impact on the market for ether, the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, with the rumor sending the price below $300.  That market decline has continued, market data shows, with the price of ether dropping to about $231 at press time, a drop of more than 20% since the start of the day’s trading (though its unclear if the two events are connected).

Vaswani did not elaborate what exactly such ""play"" is, remarking that the bank been working with financial technology startups and the FCA for projects that focus on blockchain.  ""We have been talking to a couple of fintechs and have actually gone with the fintechs to the FCA to talk about how we could bring, the equivalent of bitcoin, not necessarily bitcoin, but cryptocurrencies into play,"" he told the network.  As for how the regulator might react to the push, that remains to be seen.  Though the FCA has played an active role in creating an environment that fosters innovation – the regulator has welcomed a number of blockchain and digital currency related startups into its experimental ""sandbox"" – it has also expressed caution in recent weeks about investing in cryptocurrencies.  ""I am not saying that we view digital currencies as an inherently bad thing … but we do have to exercise a degree of caution,"" Chris Woolard, the FCA's director of strategy and competition, said during a blockchain-related event earlier this month.

In an announcement released last week, the Navy said it will apply the technology to its processes for additive manufacturing – known more popularly as 3-D printing – in a bid to ""securely share data throughout the manufacturing process"" as it creates ""critical"" equipment for deployed forces.

42427627,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWwNh,1498477540,Gemalto Seeks to Patent Method for Secure Blockchain Identity,"Digital security vendor Gemalto is looking to stake its claim in the burgeoning blockchain identity sector.  According to a patent application recently published by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Gemalto is seeking to protect a method for securing a user's trusted identity by using paired public and private keys, and creating blockchain transactions to store, verify and retrieve identity information.  Today, trusted identities are centrally issued for authentication purposes for areas such as tax, banking, employment and social welfare. But as identity theft and fraud pose growing financial threats, with billions of dollars at stake in the US alone, blockchain is emerging as a potentially more secure solution – a use case championed by Accenture, Microsoft and others.  ""Such a fraud is possible because there is no easy way to verify the true owner of a trusted identity. In other words, a thief can use a stolen trusted identity since only the validity – as such – of the trusted identity is controlled,"" the application reads.  The patent was submitted in December 2015, though it still remains to be seen whether it will be awarded.  For now, however, the patent perhaps adds new context to Gemalto's efforts in the blockchain sector, which have elsewhere focused on examining the intersection of blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT). In January, the company joined a consortium of businesses that includes Cisco and Bosch to develop solutions in the field.  Gemalto previously told CoinDesk in interview that it believes two waves of blockchain development will occur: the first led by financial institutions and second one driven by IoT adoption.

42427621,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWwBh,1498475024,Counting Chickens: Can Blockchain Restore Trust in China's Food Supply?,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and the author of CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to CoinDesk subscribers.      Last week, CoinDesk reported that the technology arm of Chinese web insurer ZhongAn was developing a blockchain platform.  Not for insurance, though, as you might expect. This one will help track the provenance of chicken.  While this marks a first for the Chinese company (partially owned by Alibaba, Tencent and insurance giant Ping An), the launch will join a growing list of blockchain projects aimed at improving China's food safety record.  Over the past few years, the country has been hit by a series of scandals involving contaminated produce and supply chain fraud, and initiatives to improve the industry's reputation are emerging from a broad range of public and private entities.  This particular project, though, is especially intriguing, not only for its potential impact on agriculture, but also because of its timing.  Earlier this month, the US Department of Agriculture proposed allowing China to export domestic chicken to the US. Beyond opening up a potentially vast market for Chinese exporters, this move could help to reinforce China’s bid to strengthen its global footprint.  The impact will not only be felt in the export market. Improving consumer confidence in Chinese produce will also affect domestic sales, and could end up helping to improve trust in institutions.  Lack of trust  The boost is sorely needed: a 2015 Pew Internet Research Survey revealed that over 70% of Chinese citizens were worried about food safety, almost three times as many as in 2008. While not top of the list of concerns (that honor goes to corruption, pollution and inequality), food safety ranked above unemployment, healthcare and workers’ conditions.  The urgency is also reflected in statements from the Communist Party of China. The influential ""No. 1 Central Document"" – the first policy statement of the year put out by the Central Committee – established agricultural innovation as a priority, and specifically mentions quality supervision and standards. This could point to an important level of official support for current and future food supply projects investigating blockchain’s potential.  Beyond the compelling case for lowering the risk in people’s daily food consumption, we can see the emergence of an interesting strategy.  Given the technology’s efficiency in tracking provenance and in enhancing supply chain transparency, it’s easy to see how blockchain projects might improve China’s reputation in this field.  Benefits to society  However, the vision seems to be about more than “catching up.” The level of development work focused on this use case suggests that the strategy is more to “overtake.” If China’s food producers and distributors can harness the improved level of trust that blockchain technology offers, it could end up becoming an agricultural powerhouse – not only for its growing population, but also for export.  Given the size of the potential market, the economic impact could be huge.  Furthermore, the relatively easy scalability of blockchain projects will ease the strain on the various platforms as they expand to accommodate increased demand for clear food safety measures, both at home and elsewhere. Last week, for example, China and the European Union launched a joint project to combat food fraud. Other international collaborations are likely to follow.  So, while the ZhongAn development is young, it forms part of an encouraging bigger picture: the expansion of blockchain technology applications to deep problems that affect a society’s well-being.  Because, economic advantages aside, a more compelling benefit lies in the end product itself. After all, there are few things more important than feeding people safely.

42427633,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWwZh,1498471211,Are Smart Contracts Smart? A Critical Look at Basic Blockchain Questions,"David M. Adlerstein is counsel at New York City law firm Wachtell, Lipton Rosen & Katz, where he focuses on mergers and acquisitions, corporate, securities law and regulatory matters.  In this opinion piece, Adlerstein discusses the current state of smart contracts, providing what he believes is a useful definition for the concept that can help answer key questions about the emerging technology.      I invite the reader to perform a simple experiment: Ask five people with reasonable working familiarity with blockchain to list five key potential benefits of the technology.  I'd wager that at least three will include ""smart contracts"" on that list. Ask that same group to define what a smart contract is, and you'll get at least three different answers (likely ranging from an agreement for the transfer of an asset on a blockchain, to the simple execution of code on the blockchain, to the koan-like ""code is law"").  While it is clear that technology (notably blockchain) is opening new horizons for the creation and performance of legal agreements, there is no consensus as to what people mean when smart contracts are discussed. This naturally sows confusion, including as to the legal status of smart contracts.  This article attempts to enhance discussion by positing a working legal definition of smart contracts, and, using that definition as a framework, offering preliminary answers to three fundamental questions of interest to technologists and lawyers alike: Are smart contracts contracts? Are smart contracts smart? And are smart contracts legally recognizable?  The working definition of a ""smart contract"" is a consensual arrangement between at least two parties for an automated, independent commercial result from the satisfaction or non-satisfaction, determined objectively through code, of a specific factual condition.  A few preliminary observations on this working definition. First, it is prescriptive; I do not contend that this describes general current use of the term ""smart contract."" Moreover, while blockchain promises to facilitate arrangements of this type, I submit that a smart contract can exist outside of the context of a blockchain (and the foregoing questions remain pertinent as to non-blockchain-based arrangements) and that a smart contract can have as its subject matter something other than the custody or transfer of an asset.  Importantly, a non-consensual or single party arrangement is, per my definition, not a smart contract (consistent with the legal conception of a contract, as discussed infra). An arrangement where either effecting the result of the arrangement or making a determination of whether that result will occur requires human intervention beyond the bounds of the arrangement is also not a smart contract.  Finally, the ""independent commercial result"" is a necessary element of the definition, for the simple reason that computer code always consists of deterministic ""if-then"" statements (for example: if I am playing a driving video game and move my control pad to the left, then the car in the game will move to the left – but this is obviously not a smart contract).  Are smart contracts contracts?  Within the American legal system, a contract is ""an agreement between two or more parties creating obligations that are enforceable or otherwise recognizable at law."" For an agreement to be enforceable or otherwise recognizable at law (as opposed to, say, an unenforceable agreement with me that senior citizens shouldn't invest their life savings in dogecoin), three particular elements must be present:  An offer (basically, expression of a willingness to enter into a binding agreement subject to the offeree's acceptance of the proposed terms);  An acceptance of those terms  A mutual exchange of value – so-called ""consideration.""  Legally binding agreements identify the parties and subject matter with particularity, and include mutual promises, which may be absolute or subject to conditions. A legally binding agreement may be written, including, as discussed below, in an electronic form, or oral (except in limited circumstances).  And finally, the legal system offers remedies for the breach of a legally binding agreement, such as a requirement to pay damages or, in certain circumstances, a court order mandating performance under penalty of law.  My contention, as per the working definition posited above, is that smart contracts can be, but are not necessarily, legally binding contracts.  In Nick Szabo's classic conception, a humble vending machine transaction is a proto-smart contract, consistent with the working definition: insert a dollar and automatically receive a can of soda. Now in the case of this vending machine transaction, there actually is a legally binding contract.  Stocking the vending machine with beverages and inviting passersby to insert a dollar to purchase one constitutes an offer. Actually inserting that dollar constitutes acceptance. The dollar and soda, respectively, are consideration. And while it would be petty to sue over it, if the machine eats my dollar without giving me a soda, I would have legal recourse.  But a smart contract may represent only a component of, or means of performing a component of, a legally binding contract, rather than an entire contract.  Per the offered working definition, the feature of an adjustable-rate mortgage providing for automatic deductions of mortgage payments due from a bank account would constitute a smart contract: if the reference interest rate changes, the amount of the payment will automatically adjust upwards or downwards.  But this adjustable payment mechanism is only a component of the mortgage agreement, not the agreement as a whole, which would be evidenced separately. For example, this payment arrangement, though it implies the existence of offer, acceptance and consideration, does not itself fully evidence the existence of those components, or other key terms of the mortgage, such as an identification of the mortgaged property, disbursement of the actual mortgage loan or resolution of disputes.  The writing evidencing a legally binding agreement can be electronic (with an electronic ""click-through agreement"" representing a typical example). In the context of blockchain technology, it is possible to record an agreement – or a cryptographic hash of an agreement – as metadata within a blockchain.  While this may in and of itself offer distinct advantages, particularly in establishing for posterity what the definitive terms of an agreement are, recording a legally binding agreement within a blockchain does not, without more, create a smart contract.  Only to the extent that performance of that agreement is automated through code based on satisfaction or non-satisfaction of an objective precondition is there a smart contract.  Are smart contracts smart?  While contractual performance is today often automated for certain uses (for example, periodic auto-payments), sophisticated commercial contracts are rife with ""if/then"" provisions, dependent on the state of objectively verifiable facts, often requiring manual administration and susceptible to misapplication or inadvertent non-application.  Thus, smart contracts can be said to be ""smart"" to the extent they offer the efficiency of automated contractual performance and reduce the risk of human error and prospects of a dispute.  But barring quantum improvements in artificial intelligence, the utility of smart contracts is limited to situations where the satisfaction or non-satisfaction of a particular factual condition is objectively ascertainable through programmatic reference to an extrinsic data source (an ""oracle""). In the context of commercial agreements, a computer can be programmed, say, to use an oracle to ascertain whether LIBOR has increased or decreased.  This is not to say that smart contracts are simple; indeed a smart contract could encompass a range of complex results based on multiple inputs. But a computer cannot (today, at least) be programmed to accurately ascertain, for example, whether or not a party to a merger agreement has used reasonable best efforts to obtain a regulatory approval. Viewed through this prism, smart contracts aren't actually smart; they are deterministic.  The promise of blockchain technology and smart contracts is, then, at root not about any kind of native intelligence or computers as lawyers.  Rather, it is about blockchain's potential to offer efficiency gains by greatly expanding the scope of contractual matters for which performance can be automated as the nexus among assets, service capabilities and the blockchain grows (especially with the advent of the Internet of Things).  However, many aspects of sophisticated commercial agreements are not susceptible to automation, including matters requiring subjective human judgment, the rendition of sophisticated or human-intensive services or the resolution of disputes.  Accordingly, while some relatively simple agreements could have essentially all of their performance automated (including by blockchain), for more sophisticated agreements only discrete elements are likely to be automated in the foreseeable future; thus, ""smart contractual provisions"" might be a more appropriate term.  By analogy, blockchain technology will for the lawyer be like power tools to the carpenter, not like the self-driving car to the chauffeur.  And given that computer code is as susceptible to error as prose and that legally binding agreements must be subject to judicial enforcement, as the use of smart contracts grows, in the context of sophisticated agreements providing for ongoing performance, it will be necessary to maintain safety valves (in the context of blockchain technology, perhaps in the form of private keys) for a court or arbitrator to be able override smart contractual provisions.  In other words, irrevocable automation with no possibility of intervention by a ""smart human"" would be perilous.  Are smart contracts legally recognizable?  Blockchain technology has increasingly become a point of state legislative focus (notably in Delaware), and there have been recent efforts to specifically authorize smart contracts in some states. Of particular note, in March 2017, Arizona enacted legislation legalizing smart contracts (defined in the law as ""an event-driven program, with state, that runs on a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger and that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger"").  Unlike the working definition proposed above, Arizona defines smart contracts with specific reference to blockchain technology, and limits the applicability to the custody and transfer of assets – a narrow definition, but one well suited to many burgeoning use cases of the technology.  And new blockchain-related legislation in Nevada was initially proposed including a definition of smart contracts as an ""electronic record … which is verified by the use of a blockchain"" (but the legislation as enacted dropped the definition).  Even without welcome state legislative initiatives, there are existing common law and statutory bases for a court to enforce a legally binding agreement – or component of a legally binding agreement – existing in electronic or code form, as long as that form is reducible to writing:  Under longstanding common law contractual principles, extrinsic writings may be specifically incorporated into a legally binding agreement. Accordingly, insofar as smart contracts represent components of legally binding agreements, they are binding if specifically incorporated by reference into a written agreement. For example, in the case of a written loan agreement providing for a pledge of collateral where the pledge is reflected in a blockchain and would be automatically released on repayment of the loan, an agreement referring to the contemplated automatic release and including an excerpt from the applicable executable code in an annex should be enforceable by a court.  Under the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (2000), a contract, signature or record is not considered unenforceable merely on the basis of being in an electronic format (but the record must remain capable of being reproduced for later reference). While the author is aware of no case specifically considering the question, there is no reason to conclude that an electronic contract in code and not prose would be unenforceable, so long as the parties, subject matter and terms are clearly articulated in a manner essentially translatable to English, like a foreign language, and there is evidence of mutual consent in deploying the code in question, with each party giving consideration.  Under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (adopted by 47 states), transactions may be conducted by electronic means, such that the act gives legal recognition to electronic signatures, records and contracts.  Under Article 9-105 of the Uniform Commercial Code (the law adopted by all 50 states governing secured transactions) a secured party has control of “electronic chattel paper” if a system for evidencing the transfer of interests reliably establishes the secured party as assignee (among other things, a single authoritative copy of the record must exist which is unique, identifiable and generally unalterable).  Terminology aside, new technology (and blockchain in particular) promises to have a far reaching impact on how legal agreements are evidenced and performed. But existing concepts of what constitutes a legally binding agreement will endure, as will the human element in negotiating and administering sophisticated commercial agreements.  And while thoughtful legislative initiatives are welcome, existing legal frameworks likely already provide a reasonably robust basis for enforcement.

42379542,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88Y13,1498467615,"'Flippening' Flop? As Ethereum's Price Pulls Back, Market Remains Bullish","After weeks of torrid growth, it seems ether's much-hyped 'Flippening' may be on the verge of falling short.  Just weeks ago, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain looked poised to become the world's largest by market capitalization, making ethereum the most valuable public blockchain. But as the calendar turns to July, that trend appears to be becoming less of a certainty.  After peaking at nearly $415 in mid-June, ether's price declined to roughly $300 yesterday, an approximately 27% drop from its all-time high. Further, with this decline, ethereum's market cap fell to less than 70% of bitcoin's, down from more than 82% mid-month.  At stake in this game of numbers is the position of market leader in the nascent blockchain sector, one that has long been dominated, and defined by, investment in the bitcoin protocol.  But while bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency to scale, has historically been the largest, its market share has been declining steadily, spurred in no small part by the growing use of ethereum.  The question now on many investor minds is will this trend continue and what's next?  Bulls on parade  Previously, analysts have predicted that ether would inevitably surpass bitcoin, in some cases, going so far to estimate that this changing of the guard will take place in 2017.  And despite ether's recent price woes, analysts largely still believe this will be the case.  Tim Enneking, managing director of cryptocurrency hedge fund Crypto Asset Fund, was firmly of the view that ether is on track to becoming the market leader.  Enneking told CoinDesk:  ""Ethereum will still take over top spot in terms of market cap from bitcoin before the end of the year.""  In this light, he called ether's recent price movements simply ""a bit of consolidation before the next push"".  Marius Rupsys, a cryptocurrency trader and co-founder of fintech startup InvoicePool, offered a similar view. ""I still believe that [ether] is moving to become largest by market cap. It will not happen in a day, but it is getting there,"" he said.  Rupsys spoke to a few variables that could impact the price of bitcoin and ether, including bitcoin's ongoing scaling dilemma, which he said could further push investors to other digital assets if progress stalls.  Bitcoin's weakness  That said, it appears bitcoin's ecosystem may be on the verge of making just that adjustment.  Various stakeholders in the bitcoin ecosystem have been working toward solving the block size challenge for some time, and the network may have finally found a solution in a proposal named Segwit2x.  The plan, which would both reduce the size of transactions and also make the blocks in bitcoin's blockchain larger, recently attained the support of nearly 90% of bitcoin miners, meaning once the software is released, improvements could be swift.  Still, this is far from an inevitability, and there are still scenarios that could arise in which the bitcoin network, like ethereum's last year, splits in two. This fact isn't lost on investors, most of whom said the situation seems uncertain due to the several competing proposals for the network's future.  Rupsys, for example, suggested that such uncertainty could push investment dollars to ether, should its developers be able to avoid similar issues.  ""There might be many different scenarios how [the scaling dilemma] could unfold. Therefore I expect there will be quite some price volatility or maybe 'flippening' to other chains like ether,"" he said. ""This might be the event that makes ether more valuable than bitcoin by market cap.""  Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency fund Jen Advisors, largely agreed, adding that the growing number of developers and users supporting ether could cause the alternative asset protocol to overtake bitcoin.  ""With a possible split on the cards, it seems bitcoin's days as the standard in crypto are numbered,"" he said.  Still, others see the situation more positively. Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency platform CryptoCompare, provided a more optimistic point of view on bitcoin's ongoing scaling dilemma.  Hayter remarked:  ""Bitcoin's moves on the scaling front have given it a new lease of life. The ability for the miners to override the scaling debate issues and chart a path forward goes a long way to delivering a bright future for bitcoin.""  Coin-offering congestion  Adding depth to the argument is that, while bitcoin has been working to address its scaling challenge, ethereum has been struggling with problems of its own.  Recently, the network has been showing signs of strain as a rapid influx of investors seek to take part in initial coin offerings (ICOs), or investments in new cryptocurrency startups and projects that use the ether currency.  A perfect example is the high demand that was on display in a recent ICO for Status, an ethereum-based messaging app that drew 180,000 ether (more than $60m) in its first day before going on to raise even more.  Several analysts spoke to this offering and its impact on ether. ""[The] Status ICO was too popular,"" said Joe Lee, co-founder of Magnr. ""[The] ethereum network froze up for 24 [hours] due to a flood of transactions.""  As a result, short sellers holding cash and ether on exchanges and margin trading platforms ""cashed in"" after a temporary liquidity panic, he said.  Iqbal Gandham, Managing Director at eToro, also spoke to this dynamic, though he said he suspects short-term issues will give way to what is a real use case for the ethereum network.  ""We're seeing a pullback because of the ICO,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Many people are using ethereum to purchase new coin offerings so we don't see this as anything to panic about.""  Growing pains  Overall, it seems that the sentiment put forward by Gandham was the prevailing one.  Arthur Hayes, founder and CEO of leveraged cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, for example, offered optimistic commentary on ether, framing it as a bump in the road to larger growth.  ""Ether's price is correcting as the network struggles to handle the volume of transactions due to the ICO craze,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""In spite of these issues, the demand for new issues shows no signs of abating. This is a healthy correction during a strong rally.""  Gandham went on to address these struggles, emphasizing his belief that all new technologies encounter challenges, and maintaining that ethereum has been creating many new opportunities for entrepreneurs.  In spite of all this potential, he stated that it is not clear whether ether will end up surpassing bitcoin, though owing to the nascent market, he wasn't bullish enough to say for sure.  Overall, Gandham notably demurred to a wait-and-see philosophy, one buoyed by the fact that, in the world of cryptocurrencies, no possibility is too far-fetched.  He concluded:  ""It's still too early in the development of the ethereum blockchain to say that it won't catch up with bitcoin.""
