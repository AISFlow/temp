42399445,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9eK,1477087517,Bitfinex to Hacker: Can We Have Our Bitcoin Back?,"Bitfinex is seeking to strike a deal with the hacker or hackers who stole $65m in bitcoin from the exchange back in August.  The latest twist in the ongoing story comes nearly three months after Bitfinex lost roughly 120,000 BTC in the breach. The exchange was offline for days before restoring service and eventually electing to pursue a novel (and controversial) way to spread the loss among users.  Now, the exchange is seeking to recover the lost funds from the hacker in a bid to expedite their repayment by setting up a secure channel for communication.  Representatives of Bitfinex explained that while previous bounties had been offered for information on the theft, the Hong Kong-based company had not made any direct overtures to the hacker.  In a blog post today, Bitfinex did just that, setting up an email address, PGP key and public key server, while also offering instructions on why it believes the technical tools would enable the hacker to securely, and anonymously, contact the exchange.  Bitfinex chief strategy officer Philip Potter told CoinDesk:  ""We wanted to offer clear instructions on how to communicate should the hacker feel there might be a better [or safer] way of getting paid at some fraction of the original theft amount.""  Previously, Bitfinex had offered to give 5% of the value of the stolen bitcoins to anyone who provided information that could lead to the recovery of the funds.  As for how this affects attempts by Bitfinex to work with authorities, Potter was less clear, declining to comment. The exchange had previously revealed it was cooperating with the FBI and undisclosed European authorities following the hack.  Bug bounty  On the size of the bounty, Potter was also not able to provide exact details, though he did suggest Bitfinex is willing to negotiate any final terms with the hacker.  ""We are open to any arrangement that maximizes recovery for our customers,"" Potter explained. ""We will consider any [and] all arrangements to that end.""  Potter also spoke to what he saw as the value of the deal given that Bitfinex believes the stolen funds have not been exchanged or sold, and that doing so would be difficult given their public visibility on the bitcoin blockchain.  The funds, if received, could go a long way toward helping Bitfinex and its users recover from the theft.  Potter said the funds will be used to purchase the BFX tokens and Recovery Right Token (RRT) issued to investors as compensation for the breach. (More details can be found in an extended blog post for investors here).  According to company blog posts, roughly 2.5% of the outstanding digital IOUs issued to consumers have been so far redeemed.  Market boost  If returned, the funds could also give a boost to the bitcoin market as a whole.  For example, market analysts continue to assert that the massive reduction in market supply caused by the theft has had an adverse effect on interest and sentiment, while at the same time reducing exchange liquidity.  In the past few months, the bitcoin market has also provided evidence to these claims, rising and falling sharply on what analysts suggest were likely single outsized trades.  Notably, the price of bitcoin has traded largely sideways since the incident, with data indicating that it has not yet recovered above its 31st July value of $654.98.

42399444,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9dL,1477077245,IT Firm Fujitsu Sees Commercial Interest in Blockchain Security,"Japanese IT giant Fujitsu has developed tools for securely sharing documents via blockchain, with an eye to bring commercial products to market next year.  Detailed earlier this week, the project was co-developed by Fujitsu teams based in Japan and the US. The news comes months after Fujitsu joined the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger blockchain project, with Yoshinobu Sawano, Fujitsu’s lead on fintech initiatives, sitting on its governing board. The company has also worked with firms like Japanese bank Mizuho on other blockchain applications.  Now, Fujitsu is pitching what it calls “blockchain-based security technologies” following months of internal development. While subject to further testing, Fujitsu said that it would seek to launch commercialize products sometime in 2017.  Fujitsu explained in a recent blog post:  “With a view to applying the blockchain to a variety of fields, Fujitsu Laboratories has now developed two technologies: a transaction restriction technology based on pre-established policies to restrict trading, such as by restricting users, and a document encryption technology, which allows only relevant parties who hold multiple distributed keys to securely access the information recorded in the blockchain.”  The company said it would look to apply the tech to supply chain and back office environments, though it didn’t offer details on the specific industries for which they’re aiming.

42399439,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9ZP,1477067421,UBS Names Former APAC CTO New Blockchain Lead,"Swiss banking giant UBS has named a new head of blockchain.  Following the departure of its first head of blockchain Alex Batlin this week, former UBS APAC CTO Peter Stephens will assume the role. Batlin, who left the bank on Thursday, heads now to BNY Mellon where he will continue his work on blockchain.  While a lesser-known name internationally, Stephens brings significant experience to the role given he has long served as a public spokesperson for UBS and its blockchain work.  How the transition will shape UBS and its vision for blockchain is less clear, though there are hints as to what may be ahead.  Speaking at last year's Finnovasia conference in Hong Kong, Stephens was vocal about his belief that blockchain will be a disruptive force beyond finance, and that collaboration is necessary for banks to unlock the full potential of the technology.  ""[Blockchain] will take business models out completely, it will create new business models,"" Stephens said. ""Disruption from blockchain isn't just going to be in financial services.""

42399426,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9Nb,1477065238,Visa to Launch Blockchain Payments Service Next Year,"Visa has announced new details about a forthcoming business-to-business payments service developed in partnership with blockchain startup Chain.  Dubbed Visa B2B Connect, the near real-time settlement platform is aimed at providing a more secure, transparent mechanism for businesses making payments via Visa’s netowrk.  That the two firms would co-develop a platform for payments is perhaps unsurprising given their existing relationship and the fact that Visa was took part in Chain’s $30m funding round, announced last September. The credit card giant has made other blockchain tests related to payments public in the past year.  Jim McCarthy, Visa’s executive vice president for innovation and strategic partnerships, said in a statement:  ""The time has never been better for the global business community to take advantage of new payment technologies and improve some of the most fundamental processes needed to run their businesses. We are developing our new solution to give our financial institution partners an efficient, transparent way for payments to be made across the world.""  Visa didn’t provide an exact launch date for the new service, describing today’s move as a ""preview"". However, the company said that it will look to begin piloting the service in 2017.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Chain.

42399440,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9aO,1477062421,"IBM, SBI to Test Blockchain Bond Trading","IBM is working with a Japanese securities firm on a new blockchain pilot focused on developing the foundations for a next-generation bond trading system.  IBM and SBI Securities, a subsidiary of SBI Holdings, are looking to create new mechanisms for trading bonds, using IBM’s Hyperledger blockchain as a basis for the trials. The goal of the collaboration between SBI and IBM is to test commercially viable platforms for blockchain-based bond trading.  The two firms aren't the only ones testing this particular use cases. Several companies have explored using the technology to facilitate the trade of catastrophe bonds, while others have looked at developing different kinds of bond exchange platforms.  Hiroyuki Ogawa, chief executive for SBI Securities, said in a statement:  “This test aims to scrutinize barriers or complexity for practical use, develop a plan for deployment, and accumulate knowledge through applying blockchain technology to our products.”  SBI Holdings, through its subsidiary SBI Investments, has acquired stakes in firms like Japanese bitcoin exchange bitFlyer. SBI Holdings also took part in Ripple’s $55m Series B funding round, announced last month, and later partnered with Ripple to launch a new business aimed at pitching the startup’s technology to markets in Asia.  The project is the latest trial of its kind announced by IBM, which has been working with a variety of international firms to test applications of the technology. Earlier this week, IBM announced that it is working with Walmart to test a supply chain application focused on China's huge pork market.

42399435,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9WS,1477057690,Former NYDFS Counsel Joins Perkins Coie Blockchain Practice,"A former attorney for the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) involved with the development of the state’s BitLicense regulatory regime has been hired by international law firm Perkins Coie.  Dana Syracuse, who joined the firm last week, is now senior counsel for Perkins Coie’s Technology Transactions and Privacy practice, based in New York. There, according to the firm, he will help spearhead its work in the blockchain and digital currency space.  Syracuse will be working on both legal issues related to blockchain as well broader fintech, describing it to CoinDesk as an even split in the near-term. However, he indicated that as blockchain applications gain traction in the finance space, this balance could shift – particularly as both Wall Street incumbents and regulators begin to grapple more directly with questions related to the technology.  He said in an email:  “This will require wrestling with some very tough questions about the applicability of old laws to the movement of value and data in new ways, and whether new laws are needed – particularly in the areas of identity and anti-money laundering. Answering these questions will require a deep understanding of the technology and the law.”  Syracuse played a role in the creation of the BitLicense, a framework that New York financial regulators began crafting more than two years ago. He departed the agency last year.  The NYDFS released its final version in June 2015, and to date has only granted a few BitLicenses to startups like Circle and Ripple. When released, the BitLicense drew criticism from some quarters of the digital currency and blockchain space, prompting several companies to cease operating in the state.  Before joining Perkins Coie, Syracuse had joined law firm BuckleySandler LLP as a counsel for its New York offices. There, according to press materials published at the time, he worked on cybersecurity and digital currency issues. Prior to his work at the NYDFS, Syracuse served as assistant attorney general for New York, working for its Taxpayer Protection Bureau.

42399442,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj9cM,1477050921,The Bitfinex Hack is Still Scaring Away Bitcoin Traders,"Bitfinex's hack continues to cast a shadow.  While the price of bitcoin had a relatively quiet month in September (one characterized by low volatility and lackluster trading), the Bitfinex hack continued to serve as a drag on the world's largest digital currency market.  Arthur Hayes, CEO and co-founder of bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, noted that the sideways price movements that took place during the month were most likely a direct consequence of the Bitfinex hack. He argued that with 120,000 BTC removed from the market, the event continues to ""suffocate bitcoin interest and sentiment"".  But even though trading volume was tepid during September, speculation was high, and these market conditions combined to fuel some rapid and aggressive long and short squeezes.  Overall, bitcoin prices rose 6.3% during September, which represented the smallest monthly change observed since March, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals.  While this figure was slightly smaller than July’s 6.93% drop and August’s 8.56% decline, it was sharply lower than the fluctuations experienced in May and June, when bitcoin prices surged 21.70% and 26.46%, respectively.  Sideways movements  Indeed, after experiencing some major fluctuations early in the month, bitcoin prices moved little for the duration of September.  The digital currency’s modest price movements resulted in low volatility, and data supplied by leveraged bitcoin exchange BitMEX supported this market calm.  The BitMEX 30-day Historical Volatility Index (also known as the .BVOL Index), averaged 24.7% in September, less than half of August’s figure of 49.97%.  Volatility started out very high in September, surging to 48.84% on 1st September and averaging 29.9% during the first four days of the month, additional BitMEX figures reveal.  However, these numbers then proceeded to push gradually lower.  But bitcoin prices experienced some notable fluctuations early in the month, developments analysts asserted were likely caused by single traders making large transactions.  Single traders were able to trigger these major price fluctuations as the ""disappearance of a large amount of bitcoins"" created ""reduced liquidity on the exchanges,"" said Whaleclub's Petar Zivkovski. ""The order books were 40-60% thinner than they were historically, on average, resulting in price spikes or crashes even on relatively low volume.""  This thin liquidity combined with high speculation, as Whaleclub data reveals market sentiment was overwhelmingly bullish during the month. Long interest – as measured by the total position size – averaged 81% in September.  Still, many traders prefer to sit on the sidelines in anticipation of a ""big move"" and higher liquidity, Zivkovski noted.  Bitfinex recovers  While Bitfinex has been cited as having a depressing impact on the bitcoin market, the exchange made several announcements during the month that helped restore market confidence in its future.  The exchange announced redemptions of its Bitfinex tokens (issued to investors as IOUs for the loss) on 1st September and 30th September. Then on 16th September, Bitfinex offered further detail on opportunities for exchanging BFX tokens, announcing a special purpose vehicle for converting BFX tokens into beneficial interests in iFinex, its parent company.  While some market observers were critical of the exchange’s response to the hack, Kong Gao, overseas marketing manager for bitcoin trader Richfund, offered a different point of view, stating that Bitfinex made ""all the right moves to recover from their loss"".  Elsewhere, digital hedge fund operator Jacob Eliosoff described September as a ""dull month.""  Trading was lackluster, volatility was for the most part low and notable price movements were few in number, he said.  However, as Bitfinex continues to make efforts to regain the confidence of traders and the memory of its issues fades, the market could be poised for recovery as we head into 2017.
