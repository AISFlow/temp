42421827,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwAHN,1661809125,On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Transactions: What’s the Difference?,"Blockchain technology can be used to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions without the need for a trusted third party like a bank. “On-chain” transactions carried out on a blockchain offer greater security and transparency, becausse they’re verified and recorded on a public distributed ledger that cannot be changed.  But blockchain transactions may include high fees and slow processing times, depending on the network’s verification method. For example, on the Bitcoin network, it can take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of days to confirm a bitcoin (BTC) payment.  Off-chain transactions are confirmed outside of the main blockchain network, often resulting in a cheaper and faster process for the user.  Here are the differences between on-chain and off-chain transactions and when they're both used.  What are on-chain transactions?  On-chain transactions refer to a transaction that is carried out on a blockchain network from start to finish. Once verified, the transaction is recorded on a blockchain network’s public ledger.  Here’s how it works: When two parties want to trade cryptocurrency, information about the transaction is packaged and time-stamped on a digital collection of data called a block. That block is sent to an associated blockchain network where it waits to be validated by computers in the network called nodes and added to the blockchain.  There are different consensus mechanisms used to verify transactions and add new blocks to a blockchain. Bitcoin, for example, uses a method called proof-of-work, which rewards miners for competing against each other using specialized computer software to solve extremely difficult computational puzzles to guess or match the “hash” and win the block reward. Newer methods like proof-of-stake don’t require mining computations but require participants to lock up a set amount of the native crypto token – their “stake” – to have a chance to be the validator for a block of transactions.  Either process provides a high level of security and transparency because transaction data is public and constantly reviewed and updated by the network of miners or validators. However, the intricacy of the process means that it takes some time to process each transaction and add it to the blockchain.  Benefits of on-chain transactions include:  Security: Data stored on a blockchain is encrypted end to end and cannot be altered once recorded.  Decentralization: Blockchains are not subject to a central authority for governance, which means there’s virtually no risk of an intermediary breaching trust or manipulating data flow.  Transparency: The use of a distributed ledger means transactions are simultaneously recorded and validated in multiple locations. Using a blockchain explorer, anyone can trace a transaction back to a unique wallet address and view its activity, allowing independent verification of claims and transactions.  Disadvantages of on-chain transactions include:  Slow transactions: The speed of a blockchain transaction can vary depending on the volume of transactions in the queue to be processed, which can lead to network congestion.  High transaction fees: When the volume of transactions is high, network fees also rise. During times of high demand, the network can become extremely expensive to use.  Power usage: Specific to proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, the mining process uses a large amount of computational power and energy.  What are off-chain transactions?  In contrast, off-chain transactions transfer some of the work from a blockchain ecosystem, which can later be integrated back into a blockchain. On an off-chain network, the users agree that a third party will handle validating and authenticating transactions.  Off-chain systems tackle a blockchain network's scalability issues by facilitating faster and cheaper transactions. One off-chain transaction method is to employ a layer 2, which is a second blockchain built on top of the main blockchain (mainnet) to help the mainnet scale in speed and cost. This takes transactions off the main chain to another chain, but for the purposes of this explainer, we’ll focus on other off-chain methods.  Read more about layer 2 systems here.  Off-chain transactions can be confirmed via:  A transfer agreement between two parties  Using a third party known as a guarantor to oversee the transaction, like PayPal (PYPL)  Sending another party the private keys to a wallet, which keeps the value of the cryptocurrency inside the wallet while transferring ownership over the wallet to someone else  Benefits of off-chain systems:  Faster transaction speeds: Off-chain transactions don’t have to wait for the main blockchain network to confirm a transaction, making it faster or even instantaneous to process.  Lower cost: Transactions confirmed off-chain require little-to-no fees because the process of validation through mining or staking isn’t needed. This feature is especially useful in handling large sums of cryptocurrency.  Greater anonymity: Off-chain transactions offer more privacy because the data is not being publicly broadcast to the network.  Disadvantages of off-chain methods vary by method but can include:  Less transparency: Transactions that occur off-chain do not follow the same protocol as a blockchain, opening up more potential for disputes.  No consensus method: Without a consensus among all the users on the network, validation and authentication may be left to an intermediary. This means trust needs to be given to this third party instead of allowing all the network participants to agree as a collective.  Can be less secure: Blocks added to a blockchain cannot be altered, so operating outside of the blockchain makes a network more vulnerable to fraudulent activity.  Final thoughts  Blockchain networks provide security, transparency and ease of use when conducting a transaction. Still, some blockchain networks such as Bitcoin or Ethereum remain limited in their scalability and sometimes require high fees to process transactions. Off-chain systems address these issues and promote faster processing speeds, lower fees and greater discretion.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Xenia  Soares,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/on-chain-vs-off-chain-transactions-whats-the-difference,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7c26732c8b1d33984fb53d77c30528329ee24ee-1885x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gün Sirer, an ex-Cornell University professor turned blockchain entrepreneur, wrote that he was “disheartened” by the crypto community’s reaction to the news, which he dismissed as “obvious nonsense.”  According to Gün Sirer, Avalanche does not entrust its legal affairs to Roche, and did not direct him to file any lawsuits towards other projects – including, for example, a July class-action lawsuit against Solana Labs, the team behind the multi-billion-dollar Solana blockchain. The lawsuit alleged that Solana’s SOL token is an unregistered security whose investors have profited at the expense of retail buyers.  “For instance, we learned about the Solana lawsuit only through the press, were livid that he was suing another project and attempted to persuade him to drop the case,” wrote Gün Sirer.  Gün Sirer says Roche has only handled a few “minor” legal cases regarding Avalanche.  Roche, in his own statement, denied that a “secret pact” exists between his law firm Roche Freeman and Ava Labs.",NEGATIVE,AVAX | SOL,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | SOL,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/29/obvious-nonsense-prominent-blockchains-founder-dismisses-smear-campaign-allegation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3da11a9ddb0de14c97b8ab3998163a7ce61f342d-1860x1395.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rebounded on Monday following three consecutive days of losses.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was recently up 8.2% , also ending a three-day losing streak.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Markets appeared to still be digesting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments last week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, although a lack of impactful economic data on Monday may also be contributing to the choppy trading.  Globally, markets will likely note Germany’s inflation data for August, which is scheduled to be released on Tuesday. Expectations are for an 8.2% increase in prices from a year ago. In the U.S., all eyes will be on the August jobs report, which will come on Friday. Analysts expect that the unemployment rate will remain stable at 3.5%.  Powell’s comment last Friday that “in current circumstances, with inflation running far above 2% and the labor market extremely tight, estimates of longer-run neutral are not a place to stop or pause” reinforces Friday’s Market Wrap's commentary that the inflation battle is still ongoing.  The neutral federal-funds rate is the rate where Fed policy is considered to be neither accommodative nor restrictive.  Stocks fell on Monday, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropping 0.6%, 0.7% and 1% respectively.  Crude oil futures increased 4.2%, while natural gas declined 0.4%. Gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, was 0.2% higher. Energy prices are being affected by a looming supply crisis in Europe. Gold appears to be trading down in response to U.S. dollar strength. The dollar index (DXY) for that measure was up 0.4% on Monday. Copper futures, which are viewed as an indication of the overall health of the economy, were down 2.6%.  Altcoins were mixed. Avalanche (AVAX) and Polygon (MATIC) were down 4% and 0.9% respectively, while Uniswap (UNI) was up 4.7%.

Technical Take  BTC and ETH Jump as U.S. Markets Open  Monday’s hourly BTC chart shows a sharp increase during the 13:00 UTC hour, which coincides with the opening of U.S. markets. Overnight trading shows a pronounced downturn during the 23:00 UTC hour on higher-than-average volume, using the 20-day moving average as the measure for volume.  The relative strength index (RSI) during that hour dipped into severely oversold territory, reaching as low as 18.56. The RSI is a technical indicator used to measure price momentum. Readings below 30 indicate that an asset is oversold (i.e. undervalued). Readings above 70 indicate that an asset is overbought and potentially overpriced.  Also, BTC prices breached the lower end of its Bollinger Band during the 23:00 UTC hour. Bollinger Bands measure an asset's 20-day moving average, and calculate two standard deviations above and below that average.  Traditionally, an asset’s value will remain within two standard deviations 95% of the time. Prices breaching the lower or upper limit of their Bollinger Band often signal that prices have moved too far in one direction.  A look at more recent hourly action shows a reverse of what occurred overnight, as both the RSI and Bollinger Band readings for BTC indicate that prices are overbought.  An application of the above chart to BTC’s daily chart shows that BTC is trading about 8% below its 20-day moving average, with an RSI of 35. Traders expecting BTC to revert to its 20-day moving average would be anticipating 8% of upside, were they to add long positions at current levels.  Ether behaved similarly to BTC on Monday, although its prices accelerated at a more rapid pace. ETH saw prices decline sharply during the 23:00 UTC hour on large volume, reaching oversold status on its hourly chart, but the price rebounded during the day to overbought levels.  An application of RSI and Bollinger Bands to ether’s daily chart again shows its similar behavior to BTC on the day, as it has 7% implied upside if its 20-day moving average is the target. ETH’s RSI is slightly higher than BTC’s, at 40.44.  ETH’s outperformance relative to BTC continues a trend that began to take shape in July and is visible on the ETH/BTC pair chart below. The outperformance is likely attributable to the upcoming Ethereum Merge, which is a major software update for the blockchain.  During a deflationary event, the supply of an asset decreases. The asset in turn will generally increase in value from a purely supply-and-demand perspective. Traders wishing to take advantage of this are likely adding ETH prior to the Merge, which is expected to occur next month.

42422466,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lQph,1661803246,The End of the Texas Bitcoin Mining Gold Rush,"Texas was once a promised land for bitcoin miners, a business-friendly state with stable regulations and a seemingly endless energy supply. But the tide has turned.  The state’s grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot, has slowed issuance of new permits for miners to connect to the grid, said Steve Kinard, director of bitcoin mining analytics at the Texas Blockchain Council (TBC), an industry association. Ercot is trying to balance the state’s demand and supply of electricity.  Meanwhile, the pipeline of readily available electricity in Texas has run dry, and bitcoin miners increasingly have to build out energy infrastructure such as generators and power lines for their machines to be plugged into. That buildout will take a while.  “There's very few or no sites where you're just going to show up and plug in without any work,” even for smaller sites that consume around 10 megawatts (MW), Kinard said. “A lot of people have searched for that,” and now there are none left, he said.  Ercot noted the large number of miners waiting to plug into the grid and referred CoinDesk to the TBC.  These challenges have come at an inopportune time. Crypto miners have been struggling as the price of bitcoin has slumped over the summer, reducing the miners’ profits and forcing some to sell their mined tokens to cover operating costs.  Read more: Crypto Miners Face Margin Calls, Defaults as Debt Comes Due in Bear Market  Broken promises  A slowdown in permitting has felt like a broken promise to some firms.  “While many companies were successful in building out large-scale operations in Texas, some companies did not get as much power as they initially expected, leaving them in a tough position,” said Ethan Vera, chief economist and chief operating officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies.  “We continue to see fire sales of transformers, PDUs (power distribution units) and other equipment that the mining farms can’t use due to power constraints,” Vera said.  Chinese mining pool Poolin was planning a 600 MW site in West Texas in partnership with mining rig maker Bitmain. The first phase of the site with a power capacity of 100 MW has been energized, meaning electricity is flowing to the mining machines, but the rest is on hold, Poolin hinted.  The company feels “fortunate” to have managed to energize that portion of the bitcoin mine, a spokesperson said. But “until the situation changes,” the firm will be “forced to adapt” its operations and “look for new sites to compensate for the delay in power,” the spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Poolin had to lay off part of its team in Texas, according to a former employee who was among those laid off. At least three other people left the company’s Texas office in June and July, according to LinkedIn profiles reviewed by CoinDesk.  Other miners with big plans in Texas are Riot Blockchain, Core Scientific, U.S. Bitcoin Corp., and Genesis Digital Assets (not related to Genesis Global Trading, CoinDesk’s sister company). Some of those projects have already had their interconnections approved.  The process  In March, Ercot’s Large Flexible Load Task Force (LFLTF), which manages large loads on the grid including those for crypto miners, announced an “interim” process for large energy consumers to connect to the grid, while the task force figures out how to manage these flexible loads.  Ercot requires large consumers of energy to register and get approval from authorities before they can connect to the grid, which likely slows down the process of booting up, according to Texas law firm Vinson & Elkis.  Fewer projects have been able to energize per month since the process was established, Kinard said.  The approval process is a “prudent measure to ensure grid stability until the LFLTF completes its work,” a spokesperson for Houston-based data center power management firm Lancium said. Lancium helped the task force draft some of its white papers.  The LFLTF “reviews how large flexible load impacts Ercot peak load, to help operate these new large loads on the grid reliably and efficiently. Ercot expects sufficient generation to meet forecasted demand,” the grid council said in an email.  “The LFLTF is working with a broad group of stakeholders to develop proposed rules for how to best leverage these loads to reduce loads on the grid during times of stress,” the Lancium representative said.  Despite the new, slower procedures, the council remains friendly to crypto miners, Kinard said, adding that he hasn’t heard anyone at the grid operator saying they are no longer looking to attract more mining to the state.  The task force is thinking about bitcoin miners granularly: In its latest white paper on large load and resource reporting, presented at a meeting on Aug. 22, the task force included a series of questions aimed at determining the consumption of bitcoin mines specifically, such as what cryptocurrencies it mines, what application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) it uses for bitcoin mining and what mining pool it is part of.  Based on miners’ answers, the task force will calculate the miners’ break-even price, taking into account network metrics such as crypto prices. That data will allow Ercot to estimate how miners will respond to energy market signals and plan adequate resources for each quarter.  How much is too much?  Ercot estimates that 33 gigawatts (GW) worth of bitcoin mining projects planned are waiting for permits, a representative told CoinDesk on Monday, up from 27 GW in mid-July.  Kinard said that the number of estimated mining projects waiting for interconnection is inflated because companies sometimes apply twice for the same project.  Instead, the TBC estimates that about 5 GW of mining will be built out by the end of 2023 and beyond that it’s too difficult to predict, Kinard said.  There are now 1.5 GW of active mining projects in the state, Kinard said.  By comparison, Ercot expected about 80 GW of peak demand during the summer of 2022, compared with 93 GW of energy production based on current and planned resources, according to the council as cited by the Texas comptroller.  Some of that energy production, however, is located in West Texas, far from population or industrial centers and with no transmission lines to carry it efficiently where it is needed. Those parts of Texas sometimes even give away electricity for free because of oversupply.  The task force meets periodically to discuss the management of the grid and the new rules being created, such as the registration process. At the last meeting, 50 different issues were flagged for committee review. Most of them were minor procedural-type issues, but they still have to be worked through, which takes time, Kinard said in July.  The highest bidder  With miners soaking up Texas’s excess energy, the grid is working with the miners to ensure that there is enough power to cool down homes and run essential services.  This process, known as curtailment or demand response, takes place when miners can make more money by forfeiting power, i.e. turning their machines off, for a price. They are selling it on the free market for a higher price than they would earn by mining coins.  Ercot sends notices, usually around the hottest time of the day, between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. to miners, which can choose whether to curtail their power consumption. The TBC estimates those events happen around 200 hours per year.  These voluntary measures come with “multiple benefits including a more reliant, flexible power grid, economic incentives for mining companies, and further decarbonization of the power grid through additional renewable development,” Lancium’s spokesperson said.  Riot Blockchain said it earned $9.5 million in energy credits from Ercot for curtailing its consumption in July.  Read more: Can Crypto Miners Make the World Greener?  About 1 GW of mining shut down statewide to support the grid during summer heat waves so far, Kinard said.  For Environmental Working Group (EWG), a non-governmental organization that is part of a campaign to change the bitcoin code to reduce the network’s electricity consumption, this dynamic means that taxpayers are footing the bill.  “Most of the paused Texas crypto mining operations entered an arrangement with Ercot that provides robust financial incentives, meaning the companies were basically paid by Texas energy ratepayers to temporarily stop operations,” EWG said in a press release in July.  TBC and other mining supporters believe that with the additional income miners bring to energy producers, they can invest in increasing the supply of energy, thus bringing down prices overall.  Particularly for renewable energy producers that developed assets in places like west Texas, where there is little consumption, having miners pay for energy can bring valuable revenue. On top of that, bitcoin mines are some of the most flexible energy consumers out there, meaning they can turn on and off in a few minutes, unlike factories that need hours to ramp down, proponents of the industry argue.  This flexibility is particularly important when it comes to renewable energy, which is intermittent and unpredictable because it depends on the weather. Ercot’s interim CEO, Brad Jones, followed this line of argument in an interview published by CNBC in March.  In Texas and elsewhere, miners are increasingly looking to build their own power generation capacity or work closely with producers behind-the-meter, i.e. before the power hits the grid.  It’s not that energy has run out in Texas, Kinard said, but rather, it’s that infrastructure needs to be developed to harness it. Luxor's Vera said that he expects to see more mining built in the state, but from more experienced investors.  What is “exciting” about the future is that “bitcoin mining is about to enter a phase where it's very significant high impact infrastructure investments being made,” Kinard said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/29/the-end-of-the-texas-bitcoin-mining-gold-rush,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/401ee764535102feacece9441aa0b0aa1193a579-3003x2252.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422479,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lRHh,1661803200,Cardano Builder IOG Funds $4.5M Blockchain Research Hub at Stanford University,"Cardano blockchain builder Input Output Global (IOG) has funded a $4.5 million blockchain hub at Stanford University, the latest in a series of academic research outposts around the globe.  In addition to Stanford, IOG has opened research labs and collaboration projects with the University of Edinburgh, University of Wyoming, University of Athens and Tokyo Institute of Technology. Last year, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson donated $20 million to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to establish the Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics.  Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., is a hotbed of tech innovation; the place opened a Center for Blockchain Research back in 2018, led by Dan Boneh and David Mazières, two professors who specialize in cryptography.  IOG has been collaborating with Stanford for some time, said Tim Harrison, vice president of Community and Ecosystem at IOG. “Before the research hub, we previously donated $500,000 to fund their research into blockchain scalability. As one of the world’s leading academic institutions, Stanford is an ideal location for the hub,” Harrison said in an email.  Asked if the new IOG-backed blockchain hub would promote the Cardano ecosystem or things like Haskell, the mathematical programming language used in the creation of Cardano smart contracts, Harrison said the project is “to fund researchers from multidisciplinary backgrounds.”  Working with the likes of Stanford to set up blockchain research hubs is key to the IOG vision, said CEO Charles Hoskinson. “With the Research Hub, blockchain development can grow even faster, based on the new learnings that will emerge, and the hub will add a new layer of validity to our sector that we haven’t always been afforded,” Hoskinson said in a statement.  “Healthy competition is a vital part of any growing industry, but especially in its early days, every player also needs to play its part in growing the space as a whole,” Harrison said. “Researchers at the university will be able to put forward innovative projects that will impact the blockchain industry.”",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/29/cardano-builder-iog-funds-45m-blockchain-research-hub-at-stanford-university,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d77175714b7012604f511eb8e9a8561d2d824f7-4442x3332.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421819,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwACD,1661801753,How to Pay for Porn With Crypto,"Editors note: Some of the projects linked to in this article are not safe for work  For adult content creators and sex workers, using technologies like crypto, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) isn’t exactly a craze. In fact, one could argue that crypto is simply a rational option in an industry that regularly faces police raids, censorship and blacklisting from legacy payment processors.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  Tube sites like Pornhub and subscription platforms like OnlyFans revolutionized the business model for adult content creators, prompting a shift away from the era of Jenna Jameson-like moguls toward one that encourages erotic content creators to start their own production studios right from home.  And thanks to NFT marketplaces and a growing number of digital payment options, the creator economy model theoretically allows artists of all kinds to connect with a smaller – but perhaps more loyal – circle of paying fans. In this way, some may view the technology as the next logical step in the evolution and distribution of porn.  How to pay adult content creators with crypto  A number of projects have begun cropping up across the industry that allow adult content creators and their fans to integrate crypto and NFTs.  NFTreats, for example, hosts an online magazine, Treats Zine, that helps onboard erotic artists to crypto through educational content. Notably, NFTreats lets artists split the proceeds from NFT sales with their team of up to four collaborators. NFTreats focuses on featuring elevated, sensual artwork that, in addition to being erotic, is inclusive and thoughtful.  “[Porn] doesn't have to always end in that huge dopamine hit,” said Ernest, co-founder and chief product officer at NFTreats, an inclusive, Polygon-based NFT marketplace for erotic art. The creative goes by his first name professionally.  “Sexuality is a big part of our existence, so let's make engaging with our sexuality online a nice experience. And sex education, too, I think is a big part of that,"" he added.  Read More: The Truth About Crypto and Sex Work  NFTreats collectors can purchase Polygon’s native cryptocurrency MATIC using a credit card, which makes the purchasing process on NFTreats easier for crypto beginners while still remaining discreet (no porn-related charges will show up on your credit card statement).  In addition, the iconic Playboy brand has recently integrated NFTs into its traditional business model. Playboy NFTs, the brand’s digital collectibles arm, hosts a Discord community for collectors and artists. Last October, Playboy launched a profile picture (PFP) collection called Rabbitars. Rabbitar holders can receive digital access to Playboy’s archival content, special metaverse experiences, giveaways and more.  Finally, blockchain-based economic infrastructure company Spankchain has recently introduced SpankPay, which serves as a crypto alternative to mainstream payment processors. Creators and porn platforms can integrate SpankPay into their websites to facilitate easier crypto payments with the ability to cash out to a bank account. According to the SpankPay website, models can register for a SpankPay.me profile, set up payments and keep 99% of their earnings with no chargeback risks.  The payment processor has also released its own NFT collection called Spank Pop Shots, which come in packs of four NFT videos that feature various levels of nudity from verified adult models.  The case for paying with crypto  As the popularity of platforms for erotic content has grown, so has pushback, which leaves adult content creators vulnerable to the whims of hot and cold public sentiment.  “The existence of an adult creator on these platforms is very precarious,” Ernest said. “One day, the terms and conditions are great. And then the next day, you're not allowed to do this on here, or [the platform is] withholding all of your payments … and all of a sudden, [the platform is] being leaned on by pressure groups, whether it's Christian fundamentalists or politicians.”  OnlyFans has repeatedly changed its guidelines regarding sexually explicit content and previously caught flak for blaming creators for customer chargebacks – a result, Ernest argues, of customer embarrassment that makes people want to cover their tracks.  Read More: Should Crypto and Porn Get Intimate?  And that’s why crypto – a permissionless, decentralized, censorship-resilient payment system – seems to make sense. Unlike payment processing platforms such as Visa, Mastercard or PayPal, which have reportedly blocked payments for adult content in the past, crypto doesn't require an intermediary like a bank to process peer-to-peer transactions. Creators can therefore accept payments more freely and anonymously without relying on centralized financial platforms that may change their policies because of external pressures.  Decentralization and sex work  For those in the sex work industry, the philosophy of decentralization goes beyond porn.  “I’ve been making the joke that a lot of the stuff in the [sex work] industry … has been decentralized for a while,” media personality and sex tech expert SxNoir told CoinDesk in late 2021.  Due to stigma, those who work in adult entertainment or sex work often turn to grassroots organizing to meet their needs. For example, the mutual aid organization Red Canary Song distributes food and medical care to Asian-American sex workers, and the advocacy coalition DecrimNY works to destigmatize, decriminalize and decarcerate those who perform sexual labor, whether by choice, circumstance or coercion, according to its website.  “That's not a centralized method of distribution,” SxNoir said.  Grassroots organizations often leverage monetary donations across several platforms, including cash, Venmo, CashApp, Zelle and more. There’s also the collecting and redistribution of physical goods, language services, resources and other types of aid. These efforts often happen through a collective as opposed to a single, centralized service provider. Instead of sending care recipients to a hospital, for instance, Red Canary Song operates a mobile health van described on the organization’s website as an alternative to policing in anti-trafficking.  “When we think about mutual aid and helping the community – honey, that's not centralized,” SxNoir said.  NFTs and erotic art  In addition to crypto serving as an alternate payment method for sex services, NFTs are being used by the community as a conduit for artistic expression.  “NFTs are becoming this new way for artists to express themselves online,” Ernest said.  “The traditional routes they had were [platforms] like Tumblr, Instagram, Twitter … I remember there being a huge thriving sex-positive community on Tumblr,” he explained. “Some people discovered their sexuality there. And it was just amazing. It was really pure … All of a sudden you could find this amazing art and photography centered around sex positivity and queerness.”  Tumblr then banned nudity in 2018, shutting down what some considered a refuge for online sexuality. Instagram soon followed suit, with few exceptions for breastfeeding, health-related contexts or protests.  Ernest believes NFT marketplaces might be the right solution needed to fill the gap. And sex-positive artists – along with their fans, collectors and investors – need to make sure they are part of the conversation.  “I'm looking around and I'm seeing that a lot of people are jumping on NFTs, but where's the sex positivity? Where's the queerness?” Ernest asks. “If [NFTs are] going to become culturally a big way in how we engage with art and media, then sex workers and erotic artists need to have a stake in that.”",POSITIVE,MATIC,BUSINESS | FIAT | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-to-pay-for-porn-with-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08985636a1da9651673878944a35887e0f6ed23d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply Ratio RSI 14 Is Near A &apos;Buy&apos; Signal As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, whenever the SSR RSI has gone below a value of 25 during recent years, the crypto has observed a buy signal. The &apos;Stablecoin Supply Ratio&apos; (or SSR in brief) is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin, and that that of all stablecoins. As their name implies, &apos;stablecoins&apos; are quite stable in their value as they are usually tied to fiat currencies. Because of this, investors in the crypto market shift their coins into them in times when they want to escape the volatile markets. This can build up a reserve in the form of stablecoins that can be readily deployed into cryptos like Bitcoin whenever investors feel the prices are right to jump back in. When the value of the SSR is low, it means the stablecoin market cap is high right now. This suggests there is a large amount of stablecoins piled up currently, which can act as buying pressure for cryptos like Bitcoin, and hence can be bearish for their prices. On the other hand, the SSR being high can imply the stablecoin market cap is lesser in comparison to the BTC one at the moment.

42421459,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPe9,1661793360,Why Crypto Should Support the American Data Privacy and Protection Act,"For as many privacy advancements that are happening in the crypto industry, there’s also a growing understanding that true, substantive consumer privacy cannot rely entirely on increasing access to cryptographic tools. There must also be federal action to preempt and criminalize the worst privacy abuses, and a maturing crypto industry should support those efforts – even if it means the anarchists siding with the state.  The U.S., by all measures, has lagged behind on consumer privacy regulations. This gap has created an environment where Big Tech is able to surveil and monetize your personal and sensitive data for profit. The adtech industry is a behemoth, and it has made the internet a worse place. It’s one of the reasons we need crypto to cut out the middlemen.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA), a proposed privacy-enhancing bill snaking its way through the U.S. legislative system now, would set strong limits around the type of data that companies can collect about you online. It would be, if passed, the most significant internet law introduced in decades and strongly bolster civil rights.  “There are a number of minor issues that we still believe can be tweaked in the bill, but at core it would create strong privacy protections for all Americans and block some of the most harmful data collection practices with its strict data minimization requirements (especially for sensitive data categories),” Alan Butler, executive director and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), said in an email.  The bill was introduced in June and has been substantially reworked since. It’s now praised by a number of privacy experts and is likely to receive a rare amount of bipartisan support (the type of across-the-aisle agreement usually reserved for passing military budgets). But the upcoming U.S. election cycle could derail these efforts, Butler said.  Last week, EPIC was one of 50 public interest, consumer advocacy and civil rights groups that wrote a letter to House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) urging Congress to move on the bill. No crypto firms or projects signed on, either due to unawareness or disinterest. This is regrettable. Crypto has a chance to show it can contribute to the legislative process while finding another avenue to bolster digital rights.  Read more: How Crypto Can Power the Future of Work for People of Color / Opinion  ADPPA would prohibit the use of sensitive data (like precise geolocation, biometric and health information) for targeted advertising. It would also prevent companies like Google, Facebook and Coinbase (COIN) from tracking your web behavior over time and across third-party sites. It sets strong restrictions on data collection and the “transferring” of it to third parties without your consent.  “This bill would drive a stake through the shady practices of data brokers,” Butler said.  Unlike other privacy laws, ADPPA focuses on something called “data minimization” to simply cut down on the amount of information corporations can exploit. It makes privacy the default setting. Companies would only be permitted to collect and use data for 17 essential reasons, like authentication and fraud management.  That’s in contrast with other privacy-focused regulations, like the European Union’s GDPR, that are “based on consent,” as Wired magazine put it. That leads to “an endless stream of annoying privacy pop-ups that most people click ‘yes’ on because it’s easier than going to the trouble of turning off cookies.”  Crypto’s approach to privacy has primarily focused on creating tools or methods to shield your transactional history. The industry has contributed significantly to privacy and cryptography research, and has found some of the earliest consumer uses for advanced algorithms like zk-SNARK proofs.  Read more: What Happens When You Try to Sanction a Protocol Like Tornado Cash / Opinion  This code-first approach can be symbiotic with legislative efforts, or it could be crippled by them. Earlier this month, for instance, the U.S. Treasury Dept. took the unprecedented step of sanctioning the blockchain anonymizer Tornado Cash. The code is still running, but already consumer access in the U.S. is verboten, due to money laundering concerns.  “We have been supportive for decades of the development of privacy-enhancing technologies, including in the digital currency space, and are encouraged to see new tools and systems being deployed in the world of Web3,” Butler said. “However, we believe that the most important thing right now is to increase the level of privacy protections for all internet users.”  “That is why we believe it is critical for Congress to set strong, baseline privacy requirements that will push the broader use of these privacy-enhancing technologies and put the onus back on data collectors and processors to use more privacy protective systems,” he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/08/29/why-crypto-should-support-the-american-data-privacy-and-protection-act,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba382b9adc0022aed6aeb9b1b5a955f01a060d1d-2061x1546.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411075,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBzYl,1661789032,"Introducing Sin Week: Sex, Drugs, Guns and Web3","Until recently, it was technically illegal to possess pot in the United States. Even small amounts could get you arrested and thrown in jail.  These days, about half of U.S. states allow marijuana for medical or recreational use, and many of the rest turn a blind eye. Pot is often more socially acceptable than smoking cigarettes.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  Social norms change and laws catch up, eventually. But the financial system? That’s a trickier question.  Even as pot dispensaries have appeared throughout the country, these perfectly legal businesses have often struggled to get access to bank accounts and mainstream payments. Because pot is still illegal at the federal level, companies like Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) are unwilling to play along.  It’s the same with other so-called “sin” industries, including sex work, guns and gambling. While the activities may be technically legal, depending on the jurisdiction, a mixture of corporate morality and government intrusion have hampered their activities.  Look, for instance, at how the Obama Administration’s Operation Choke Point unbanked gun sellers and payday lenders, or how the Canadian government froze donations to anti-vaccination protests. Whatever one thinks of guns, payday lenders and truckers refusing vaccines, we should question whether the government has the right to make moralizing decisions outside the legal and democratic process. The principle of free speech, among other liberties, is at stake.  Financial systems effectively have the power to dictate what is right and wrong, or at least what you and I can do easily and conveniently. When Mastercard or Visa refuse financial service to sex workers and weed dispensaries, they are making moral statements as much as following the law. And it’s this notion that cryptocurrency seeks to challenge.  Crypto says that public blockchain networks should be neutral for all to use (even if people are breaking the law). It promises openness where the traditional financial system offers censure and exclusion.  With CoinDesk’s Sin Week – a late-summer excursion around the seamier corners of the internet – you can see the clash of closed versus open finance head on. Sex workers look to crypto as an alternative to fiat payments. Weed dispensaries turn to stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Casinos set up in the metaverse offering token payouts that may or may not represent actual gambling. And so on.  However imperfectly, crypto is challenging the norms of what is permissible in the financial system, and therefore what is permissible in society.  The question for all of us, as David Z. Morris writes in a new essay (“In Defense of Crime”), is where we want the line between centralized control and pure financial freedom to lie.  Is giving up our privacy and freedom to transact online a price worth paying for the government’s ability to fight crime and terrorism? Are financial surveillance and censorship justifiable if they’re taking on, say, sex trafficking or reducing access to firearms that may kill people?  As Morris writes, some criminal behavior may not be a bad thing, all things considered. It may be worth having a little of the bad stuff if the cure is worse than the disease. Stamping out all crime may be impossible, and in trying to achieve that goal a society may be doing more harm than good.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - The Metaverse Casino That Wasn’t  Following the social theorist, Emile Durkheim, Morris argues that “crime is an inevitable byproduct of individual freedom in a modern society, a byproduct of people navigating a complex and changeable social landscape.” It may even be a positive good if it shows what society actually wants. In the case of marijuana, the “crime” of millions of people possessing and smoking a plant showed society’s moral norm may have been wrong all along.  For CoinDesk’s Sin Week, we’ll be exploring the clash of old-world finance and crypto, how Web3 can help (or not help) illicit or at least pariah industries like weed, porn, guns and gambling. In none of these cases are we suggesting that you should take part yourself. There are salubrious reasons to abstain from drugs or gambling. But we do believe that it should be up to the people to decide what vices are permissible (not a distant central government and certainly not unelected executives at Mastercard). And we, as a society, shouldn’t always be so certain or adamant about where the ethical lines should be.

42411090,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC0MM,1661788836,In Defense of Crime,"In primitive or medieval societies, criminal activity would often be explained in religious and even supernatural terms. A thief or habitual drunkard might have been seen as possessed by demons or overtaken by ill humors, his crimes a consequence of his own fundamental and even immutable failings. Things hadn’t changed all that dramatically in some quarters by even the early 20th century, when the pseudoscience of phrenology claimed to define un-reformable criminal “types” by their physical attributes – often as a pillar of racism dressed up as reason.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  These attitudes about crime and social deviance have been increasingly challenged by social and psychological research, helping us see crime as a symptom of larger problems with society, economics or politics. Emile Durkheim, one of the most influential social researchers of the past two centuries, argued that crime was the product of “anomie,” or the disconnection between individual and social goals – and could even provide insights into how to improve society.  Despite these lauded ideas, the dawn of the digital age and the spread of surveillance have renewed political interest in what Durkheim would have seen as a fool’s errand: the total elimination of crime through surveillance and censorship. Tactics Philip K. Dick hypothesized in his 1956 dystopian novella “Minority Report” are reaching the real world, particularly with the Chinese “social credit” system and the U.K.’s near-omnipresent camera surveillance. America has its own angle ­– an accelerating push for total financial oversight and censorship powers.  This looming possibility may sound appealing at first. We should all certainly want a global society without, say, a functional market for illegal weapons or child pornography. And as many first-order thinkers are eager to point out, if you’re not doing anything illegal, you don’t have any need for privacy – right?  Privacy advocates are well used to pointing out legitimate reasons for desiring financial privacy, from personal safety to political activism. But Durkheim, way back in the 1890s, made a much stronger argument. Crime, he concluded, is an inevitable byproduct of individual freedom in a modern society, a byproduct of people navigating a complex and changeable social landscape. Moreover, he argued that crime can even be a positive good if it is taken as a set of signals pointing to ways to improve society.  Socrates’ crimes  One example is the legendary trial of Socrates in Athens. Durkheim argued that ""his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country"" because ""it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed."" Though if you remember your philosophy 101, the Athenians didn’t come around to this until well after they’d executed their greatest philosopher.  Efforts like the Chinese panopticon and American financial censorship take as their goal making crime not just easily punishable, but logistically impossible. In China, for instance, suspicious persons have reduced privileges to travel. Parallel U.S. legislative moves have attempted to criminalize the use of privacy technologies such as Tornado Cash, while also pushing for more surveillance of individual bank accounts. That suggests a dark future in which you will only be allowed to spend your money on government-approved activities and products.  Read More: Netherlands Arrests Suspected Developer of Sanctioned Crypto-Mixing Service Tornado Cash  In the society foreshadowed by such schemes, Socrates wouldn’t just be executed – he would never exist in the first place. Crime, Durkheim would argue, represents a frontier of social transformation, a realm for exploring the explicitly forbidden – and, perhaps, finding its upsides. By this view, a society without crime would become stagnant as its citizens’ dissatisfactions festered under the boot heel of uniformity. Such total control doesn’t eliminate social contradictions, instead leaving them free to build up, setting the stage for a far more violent and chaotic upheaval when those tensions reach a breaking point.  A society under complete surveillance and control is, in short, a ticking time bomb waiting to explode.  Crime as public service  While Socrates’ unjust execution is a compelling example for Durkheim’s argument, we can also look to a much more contemporary case: the path to marijuana legalization. In more than half of U.S. states today, it is effectively legal to buy and consume cannabis either recreationally or under medical advice. This represents the (still-incomplete) reversal of a prohibition effort that began in 1911 and kept pot largely illicit for the better part of a century.  During that period of prohibition, tens of millions of Americans were jailed or convicted for the crime of distributing or possessing marijuana. As recently as the period from 2001-2010, the American Civil Liberties Union counted 8.2 million marijuana arrests, 88% for simple possession. As of 2010, more than 51% of all arrests in the “War on Drugs” (first launched by the Nixon administration in the early 1970s) were for pot. As recently as 2020, 40,000 Americans remained incarcerated for marijuana-related offenses.  Crime, he concluded, is an inevitable byproduct of individual freedom in a modern society.  Despite this repressive and violent multi-decade effort to eliminate cannabis use, mounting scientific evidence suggests very limited harms from its consumption by adults. Those harms are small compared not just to drugs like methamphetamine or opiates, but also relative to already-legal substances including tobacco and alcohol. The history of marijuana enforcement strongly suggests the motives behind prohibition – particularly its ramping up during the Reagan administration – were not simply protecting public health but also repressing marginalized populations including political dissidents and, most of all, African Americans. The ACLU in 2001 referred to the drug war as a pillar of “The New Jim Crow.”  Read More: Why It Can Feel Good to Be Bad in the Metaverse  This shameful epoch of government repression was based on very little evidence that marijuana posed a threat to individuals or society. Recent research into the large-scale public health impacts of marijuana legalization has found little indication of any. A recent study found cannabis use led to increased emergency room admissions, including for injury and acute symptoms of cannabis use (that is, someone got too high). But the same study found no increase in mortality among cannabis users. There are also strong indications that adolescent cannabis use can have long-term neurological effects, but marijuana remains illegal for minors in all relevant jurisdictions.  Beyond that, there is scant evidence of marijuana legalization seriously harming public health or safety, such as by increasing lung cancer or crime. One study found little evidence that legalization even increased cannabis consumption compared to pre-legalization levels.  That’s a stark contrast to another very popular substance that has been legal in the U.S. for most of the 20th century: Alcohol is vastly more harmful than marijuana for individuals and society on many measures.  According to data compiled by the Marijuana Policy Project, more than 30,000 Americans per year die from alcohol-related causes, while that number is close to zero for marijuana use. One study found that added public health expenditures per alcohol user were more than eight times higher than those for a marijuana user. The World Health Organization highlights two studies finding that even among those who seek treatment for marijuana dependence, the reported harms are less severe than those who seek treatment for alcohol dependence. The famous Harvard Grant Study of long-term life paths found that alcoholism drastically harmed sufferers’ entire personalities and career outcomes.  In other words, the criminals were right.  Despite the existence of laws categorizing marijuana trafficking and distribution as “illegal,” it was arguably even at the time an essentially harmless act. It may even have been a moral one, insofar as illicit marijuana trafficking created demand for legal reform that, in turn, reduced unjust imprisonments.  The story of marijuana legalization in the U.S. highlights the flaws of even purportedly democratic lawmaking processes. In turn, it supports Durkheim’s argument that crime, in some cases, is good for society. And it’s not hard to think of other unjust laws broken by “criminals” who faced the wrath of a misguided state: laws against interracial marriage, homosexual relationships and teaching slaves to read, to name just a few.  Not all crime  Durkheim’s argument implicitly focuses on crimes committed by those outside of power – those who must express their disconnection from the social whole through informal channels because they can’t directly challenge state power. Those sorts of crimes can push the status quo in a new direction, alert rulers to flaws in the social system (as with mass uprisings) or merely enable individual survival in an oppressive regime.  But Durkheim’s theory of crime as an expression of alienation would exclude crime committed by the powerful against the weak. That type of crime doesn’t have the potential for positive social impact, as it largely serves either to enforce the status quo or to further the universal goal of corrupt regimes: to control and steal from their subjects.  A society under complete surveillance is, in short, a ticking time bomb, waiting to explode.  This category of truly and universally harmful crime includes many misdeeds that are common today, including under the umbrella of “cryptocurrency.” A scammer who uses his Harvard pedigree to entice a broad audience into a pyramid scheme shouldn’t be mistaken for a rebel to the system. Neither should the nominally legal activities of figures like WeWork founder Adam Neuman, or state-backed activity such as the ongoing mass murder of American citizens by their police.  Fintech and the future of pre-crime  Another way of thinking about crime’s potential social upside is to see it as the bleeding edge of the “marketplace of ideas” that defines modern, small-l liberal society. Just as economist Adam Smith theorized the “invisible hand” of the market as a force for economic coordination, a democratic society must be rooted in an ongoing, free-flowing conversation about the kind of society in which its citizens want to live.  Prohibitions against some kinds of behaviors, such as Florida’s recent attempts to ban acknowledging the existence of gay people, are the intellectual equivalent of a Communist politburo trying to plan an economy. And we already know how well that tends to go.  The current American leadership’s lust for locking down financial rails may be even more pernicious, though, than specific prohibitions on individual behavior. For comparison, American freedom of speech standards prohibit measures that would create a “chilling effect” on expression, such as capricious or unpredictable post facto punishments for saying something considered offensive. But the push to erode financial privacy and enhance government financial oversight of individuals could have their own “chilling effect” on speech.  Read More: Can Ethereum Fight Back Against the US’ Sweeping Censorship Attempt?  For example, the suspicion that U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is watching might discourage people from buying a controversial book out of fear of ending up on an FBI watchlist. It could certainly make people nervous about controversial political donations, despite the Supreme Court declaring money a form of political speech (at least if you’re a huge corporation). Because so much commerce and communication these days takes place at a distance, digital tools that have the privacy of physical cash are particularly key to protecting these forms of free discourse.  We got a preview of the grim potential of financial censorship earlier this year, when the Canadian government froze donations to anti-vaccination protests by truckers. Whatever you think of the truckers’ agenda or tactics, it’s an extremely worrying precedent. Also worrying – the freeze included blacklisting blockchain addresses, making it very difficult for the protestors to access funds sent via Bitcoin or Ethereum.  Financial censorship and human moral development  Across the Abrahamic religions, believers have for centuries grappled with a fundamental conundrum: If God created man and intended for him to be good, then why did He give us the ability to sin? One entry-level theological answer is that God wants us to make the right decisions, but only under our own free will.  The same thinking has entirely secular parallels. Is our goal as a species to build societies where everyone is forced to “do the right thing” under external compulsion – or do we want to foster individuals capable of making good moral decisions based on their own judgment?  How we answer that question depends on the kind of society we want to live in, and the kind of people we want to be. Do we want to give a handful of leaders the ability to control our every move? Or do we want to focus on developing every member of society, fostering a sense of social cohesion and care in an environment of real freedom?  The choice, at least for a little while longer, is ours.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,David Z.

Huobi is one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, with a daily trading volume of over $1 billion, according to data from CoinGecko.  Speculation had been growing that FTX – which has extended financial lifelines to several troubled crypto companies including exchange BlockFi and lender Voyager Digital and could eventually acquire both firms – was planning to acquire the Seychelles-based Huobi.  In mid-August, Bloomberg reported that FTX had held preliminary talks with Huobi founder Leon Li to buy a majority stake in Huobi that would value the firm at $3 billion or more. The report said that a deal could be completed as soon as the end of this month, and that Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain network, was also interested in bidding on the stake. Sun denied any interest in a tweet.  Earlier this year, FTX bought Japanese exchange Liquid and also agreed to acquire Canadian trading platform Bitvo. FTX was also reported to be interested in acquiring no-fee trading app Robinhood, but Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said in early August he liked his company as a standalone firm.  Huobi’s native token HT declined about 6% following Bankman-Fried’s tweet.

Time To Place Your Bets","SummaryEthereum is two weeks away from the much-awaited merge.The cryptocurrency has rallied strongly in the last month but is now selling off.The upcoming merge will certainly bring about volatility but also a welcome trading opportunity.Thesis SummaryWith the Ethereum (ETH-USD) merge right around the corner, investors are beginning to place their bets on the outcome. There are at least three possible scenarios, if not more, and specific financial instruments have been designed for betting on any of these outcomes.In this article, I look at the history of Ethereum&apos;s forks to try to gain some insight into what could happen and lay out my expectations as to what will happen to Ethereum in the short and long run after the merge.Playing The OddsThe Ethereum merge is set for the 15-16th of September and will mark a historical change in the crypto world. Ethereum, the world&apos;s second-largest cryptocurrency and the most used blockchain for decentralised apps, will switch its consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.This change will have numerous implications, many of which I discussed in my previous Ethereum article. For example, miners will become obsolete, previously staked Ethereum will be released, and the whole ecosystem will be affected, with the &apos;power&apos; now in the hands of large ETH holders instead of miners. On the other hand, the merge should also lead to better efficiency and lower transactions.With that sai...",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4537651-ethereum-eth-merge-selloff-or-rally-time-place-your-bets?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/1875674.jpeg

The narrative surrounding this event has allowed ETH&apos;s price to lead the market in the past week. As a consequence, Bitcoin has been moving sideways with heavy price action.

The bounce looks fleeting as bond yields continue to rise and stock futures signal risk aversion.  Market Moves: Bitcoin may not be an inflation hedge, but there might be something to be said for it acting as a way to bet on the separation of money and state, writes CoinDesk's George Kaloudis.  Chart of the Day: Bitcoin looks south after back-to-back weekly losses.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) looked to regain some poise as the Dollar Index (DXY), one of its biggest nemeses, reversed its early jump to a fresh 20-year high.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value bounced to $20,000, having slipped to a six-week low of $19,526 late Sunday, CoinDesk data shows. Ether, the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, and other major coins also witnessed a minor bounce after the weekend's drubbing.  The DXY, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies like the euro and the Japanese yen, set a new two-decade high of 109.48 during Asian hours, extending Friday's rally triggered by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's unambiguously hawkish comments.  Bitcoin tends to move largely in the opposite direction to the DXY.  Temporary bounce?  The sustainability of the bounce was under question as the DXY pulled back mainly due to expectations of retaliatory monetary tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB) and resulting recovery in the euro.  ""Hawks at the ECB are advocating a 75 basis point hike [0.75 percentage point] at next month's meeting, and this risk seems to be lending the euro support ahead of last week's low near $0.9900,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex and the author of the Marc to Market blog, wrote in the daily newsletter.  The global tightening theme is bearish for liquidity-addicted risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Further, U.S. rates extended Friday's rise, with the two-year Treasury yield setting a 15-year high of 3.48% and the futures tied to the S&P 500 dipped 0.8%. Both offered negative cues to the crypto market.  The Fed fund futures showed a 75% chance of the central bank delivering its third 75 basis point rate hike at the September meeting. The probability stood around 50% before Friday's Powell speech.  Both bitcoin and ether's derivative market activity reflected a bearish sentiment, with futures trading at a discount to the spot price and puts or bearish bets drawing a higher price relative to calls.  Mott Capital Management's Michael Kramer said in a blog post that bitcoin could drop to $18,000, having dived out of a bear flag pattern, a bearish technical setup, last week. Kramer took note of similar bearish patterns on technology stocks and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index.

Is bitcoin a way to do that?  I’m not sure. From a market perspective, no, not at all. In recent memory, bitcoin has been correlated with stocks. Stocks aren’t supposed to be inflation hedges; less-risky things like gold and commodities are. So bitcoin’s price following (or leading) stocks makes bitcoin not really appear like an inflation hedge.  However, bitcoin is probably investable simply because it is separate from the “heads of state.” I’m not saying bitcoin’s price is immune to the acts of heads of state, but I am saying that bitcoin isn’t issued by any country and that the broader network a) doesn’t need any particular country and b) is resilient enough to buck China banning it.  So, in the event that bitcoin doesn’t behave as an inflation hedge, there might be something to be said for it acting as a way to bet on the separation of money and state.  According to Zoltan Pozsar, global head short-term interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse, we are in a war economy where heads of state matter more than heads of central banks.

42411110,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC9Jq,1661781205,The Metaverse Casino That Wasn’t,"I’m at the blackjack table. My dealer is a humanoid frog who wears a bow-tie. He doesn’t speak much. The frog deals me a 17 and himself a 16. I stay. The frog deals himself another card. He busts.  I win!  Immediately after I win the hand, chips fall from the sky like confetti. I “make it rain” by flicking money from my stack.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  Then I win again. And again. This frog can’t beat me! Then I win five times in a row. Except I’m not winning money in the traditional sense of U.S. dollars, and I’m not even winning in the crypto sense of bitcoin (BTC) or some alternative cryptocurrency. I’m playing a free, no-stakes game in the metaverse of Decentraland, which doesn’t really feel like gambling at all.  And this is the paradox of ICE Poker, the casino-that’s-not-a-casino in the heart of Decentraland. The casino has a simple hook: You can’t lose money. It’s not gambling. You can play poker all day and you earn free crypto but you won’t lose a nickel. “We officially pivoted away from gambling,” says Miles Anthony, the founder of Decentral Games, which created ICE Poker. It turns out that people like free money. With their initial model of casino games, Anthony saw around 200 daily active users. When they flipped to a model of play-to-earn, the daily users exploded to 12,000. ICE Poker is now the most highly-visited site in Decentraland, accounting for 60% of the metaverse’s total traffic.  Read More: 5 US States Issue Emergency Orders to Shut Down Metaverse Casino With Alleged Russian Ties  None of this is what Anthony expected. I first spoke with him in the summer of 2020, back in my early reporting on Decentraland. At the time he was a 25-year-old kid who, after graduating from UCLA in 2017, became a digital nomad who ran an e-commerce company while living in Portugal. He made some money during the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom, he scooped up early real estate in Decentraland, and he thought that a metaverse casino was a no-brainer. “It just makes sense to be able to wager your crypto assets,” Anthony told me in 2020.  Then it seemed to make less sense. Over the next year, as Anthony built out the business, he had to grapple with the tricky questions of gambling regulations. What if gambling is legal in some states but not others? Or barred in certain nations? What if the laws change at the next election? “To be free-to-play and non-gambling, you can scale it and market it in any jurisdiction,” says Anthony now. So scale it he has. He now leads a team of 50 and has raised $11 million, with investors that include Digital Currency Group. (DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk.)  I tried playing ICE Poker myself, and I quickly learned that saying the game is “free to play” is only sort of true. You don’t wager money in the traditional sense – Anthony repeats many times that this is not gambling – but you need to own a “wearable” non-fungible token (NFT) to play at the table, such as sunglasses or a hat for your Decentraland avatar. As of this writing, it costs 0.39 ether (ETH), or roughly $720, to buy the cheapest wearable, which I did not do for obvious reasons.  But there is a workaround that makes it truly free. Thanks to a clever system that leverages the smart contracts of NFTs, wearables can be “delegated” from one user to another. It’s a form of borrowing. Alice can buy a wearable, then delegate it (loan it) to Bob, who uses it to play poker. There’s no fee. Instead they split the winnings. The NFT’s owner pockets 40% of the payday; the player gets the remaining 60%. In theory this is a win-win: the owner gets the benefit of passive income, the player gets to play poker – for free – with zero chance of losing her own money.  So, in an example of “only in crypto,” a mini-economy has sprouted: delegators who earn passive income through loaning out their NFTs, and players who eke out crypto while enjoying poker. I thought about becoming someone’s delegate and playing a 24-hour tournament of poker, but I restrained myself for two reasons: 1) I’m lousy at poker and I’d feel guilty for costing the NFT owner any lost revenue (some are counting on this revenue); 2) I tried to do it, but the process was too damn confusing.  Here’s what’s supposed to happen: In the ICE Poker Discord, aspiring delegates (like me) can connect with wearable-owners who are looking to loan out their NFTs. Sounds simple enough. But the Discord teems with desperate and spammy-sounding messages, such as: “I’m a noob to Ice Poker and decentraland, looking to try it. Anyone wanna delegate?” Who could pass up an offer like that? Or, “Legit player with good history here. Just in case someone is looking.” OK, but how do you vet this? Or another tempting offer: “Have history but not really good.”  Many aspiring delegates send direct messages to veteran players like the pseudonymous “Empress Raeon,” a woman in her late 20s who lives in LA. “In the beginning I was getting 30 messages a day,” says Raeon. “It was insane. I was like, I have to close my DMs.” The system of delegates appears held together by DMs and duct tape, and it’s a minor miracle it works at all. Even Anthony agrees. “Obviously it’s not very user-friendly,” says the game’s creator. “It’s been amazing that people actually do it.” (He plans on rolling out a marketplace soon to make it easier for delegates and delegators to connect.)  So to get a sense of the actual in-game poker action, I turn to a prolific player who goes by “Iceyyy,” a 33-year-old guy from Boston who left his marketing job to go full-time crypto. He spends a few hours each day playing ICE Poker and streaming it on Twitch. (He clarifies that he makes most of his money from crypto consulting; the poker is for fun.) Over Zoom, Iceyyy shares his screen and I watch him enter the metaverse of Decentraland.  Read More: Is Crypto Sports Betting Ready for the Big Leagues?  Iceyyy’s avatar, like most avatars, is weird. He’s a mash-up of a dude in a Vikings helmet, beach sunglasses and what appears to be a Scottish kilt. He “teleports” to one of ICE Poker’s several casinos and is automatically assigned to a table. “There’s assigned seating, which protects the integrity of the game,” he explains. “It prevents people from cheating and colluding.”  Iceyyy settles into a table. “Hey everybody!” He types in the chatbox. “Good luck today!”  “Hey Iceyyy, same to you!”  There are two players at the table: a woman in a white tank top with a rainbow flag, and a guy with a crisp beard and black sunglasses.  After the flop, Iceyyy has a pair of eights and he raises the pot and gets the others to fold. “I’m pretty aggressive, because that’s typically a winning poker strategy,” he says.  Then Iceyyy tells me to look at something – the eyes of the other players at the table. You can see when the eyes are moving. “You can see people looking around and moving their mouse,” explains Iceyyy. If an avatar moves his or her eyes, that could be evidence that the player is moving their mouse – hovering over a betting option, and contemplating a raise. It’s a potential tell. It’s the metaverse expression of a real-life poker dynamic that you don’t have in “normal” online poker. While this is not something that Iceyyy regularly uses for an edge, it gives a glimpse of what the metaverse could offer in the future.  The only place in crypto that does not feel like a casino, ultimately, is the crypto casino.  Once Iceyyy wins that first hand, he increased his share of chips and he boosted – ever so slightly – his odds of winning the day’s tournament, or finishing near the top. And that’s the daily goal. Every 24 hours, a new “tournament” starts across the casinos of ICE Poker. The better you do in the tournament, the more ICE you win. If you finish in the top 5% of chip winnings, for example, you’ll get a double bonus of ICE. “If you lose all your chips and go broke and finish in the bottom, it deducts from the ICE,” Iceyyy explains. (If you lose every hand you won’t lose any actual money – you simply won’t earn any ICE.)  Then the wearables come into play. When Iceyyy’s avatar wears his goofy Viking helmet, he’s granted an extra multiplier to win more ICE. Paying to upgrade the wearables (from Level 1 to Level 5) yields higher multiples and the potential for winning more ICE. (These upgrades also help replenish the coffers of ICE.) Players can spend hours doing the math to optimize the “stack” of their wearables. “There’s so much depth to the game,” says Iceyyy. “It sucks you in like any good game will do.”  Part of this depth is a system of “challenges,” where players earn more ICE by hitting certain poker objectives, such as “get a two-pair five times,” or “see the flop 15 times.” Not everyone loved the challenges, at least not at first. How much skill is involved to “see the flop”? The challenges seemed to reward luck and the monotony of grinding – not true skill at poker. Worse, the challenges almost perverted and distorted the game. “Players were incentivized to play bad hands, or to call in situations where normal poker strategy would say you shouldn’t,” says Iceyyy.  So Anthony and the team evolved. They tweaked the challenges to focus more on skill, such as winning a certain number of hands. “It plays much like real poker,” says Iceyyy.  This focus on skill might help ICE Poker from a legal perspective. “We were really strategic in the way we set this up,” says Anthony, adding that several legal firms had reviewed their framework and said he’s in the clear, and that it’s “a pretty open and shut case.” Maybe. But this is new territory for everyone, including the lawyers. “The distinction between 'play to earn' and 'gambling' can be a fine line,” says Sasha Hodder, a crypto-focused attorney unaffiliated with ICE Poker, via email.  Hodder explains that because ICE Poker is a peer-to-peer game, where there is no “house” that always wins, “the decentralized nature moves the legal issues away from the appearance of gambling.” And the focus on skill matters. “If the ability to win depends on chance or luck, it's more likely to be considered gambling,” says Hodder, “whereas if the outcome depends entirely on the user's skill and abilities as a player, it's less likely to be considered as gambling.” (The counter-argument, I imagine, is that buying the wearable itself counts as a kind of “ante,” and the real gamble is that you’ll earn enough from the game to recoup the cost of the NFT. Then again, the extent of my legal background is watching “She Hulk.”)  Lawyers aside, it doesn’t feel like gambling when you’re not bleeding out cash and bellying-up to the ATM. (I’ve been there.) Iceyyy loves playing poker but he hates the heartburn of losing money, and he likes that ICE Poker removes that from the equation.  On the other hand, playing poker for free isn’t fun. There are no stakes. People don’t take it seriously. Just as I couldn’t get excited about winning blackjack against the frog, completely “free poker” is boring. (I played blackjack in one of ICE Poker’s many random free casino parties.) But thanks to the tournament structure that aligns skillful play with higher rewards, ICE Poker doesn’t feel empty or frivolous. “ICE Poker has created something new. It’s in the middle of those two categories,” says Iceyyy. “You have the potential to earn real money, but you’re not risking anything out of pocket.”  Perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising that poker and the metaverse are linked, as poker has been part of crypto’s history since its inception. “Is it possible Satoshi was building his own decentralized poker application to run on top of bitcoin?” Morgen Peck wrote in Breaker Magazine’s 2018’s “All In: The Hidden History of Poker and Crypto.” Peck noted that bitcoin’s original code contained references to poker, and that some of the luminaries of traditional online poker, such as Dan Goldman, were now pivoting to a peer-to-peer, blockchain-based poker. Goldman at the time was the chief marketing officer of a company called “Virtue Poker,” which was working to launch a poker app on Ethereum.  That was in 2018. Where is Virtue Poker today? The game launches later this year and it made the same pivot as Anthony, framing itself as a “free-to-play, play-to-earn no loss poker game.”  Gambling is out, play-to-earn is in  The irony is almost absurd, as many of us think of crypto as gambling. But Anthony makes the case that play-to-earn is simply a better, more positive vibe than traditional casino gambling. “If you just look at it from a mathematical perspective, gambling games suck money out of the community,” says Anthony. “It goes into the company’s hands over time because the house has an edge. Eventually people lose all their money.” (One of his mottos is “Be the House,” paralleling bitcoin’s mantra of “Be your own bank.”)  And the community “vibes” are part of what draw people like Raeon to the game. When she first poked around Decentraland, she didn’t really know what to do. The metaverse seemed empty. Then she discovered the casino. “ICE Poker is what kept me in Decentraland,” she says. “It’s what kept me engaged and kept me coming back.”  She met other players in the ICE Discord, at the poker tables and at poker events and parties. (Owning certain NFTs can grant access to a special “Diamond Hands City” casino, basically a VIP lounge.) She quickly found her tribe. This was tough to explain to her IRL friends, who would ask questions like, “The metaverse? What are you talking about, what are you doing?” She tried to explain that the metaverse was “like The Sims, but where you talk to people.”  Now Raeon attends metaverse parties like a Latino Music Festival or '90s-themed Throwback Thursdays. “Sometimes it gets a little wild,” she says. They drink (IRL) and talk about their beers and whiskey, and as everyone who’s been on a “Zoom happy hour” knows, it’s not the real thing but it’s better than a chat-box. “It’s getting closer and closer to just being at the bar,” says Raeon. Sometimes they even play the drinking game “Never Have I Ever,” knocking back drinks on the honor system. (The metaverse has yet to replicate Truth or Dare.)  The game begets culture, and the culture begets more ways to monetize. “I’ve always wanted to make an NFT,” says Raeon, perhaps using the word “always” a bit loosely. She adds, “I think everyone wants to make an NFT.” So Empress Raeon created ICE-themed NFTs called “Royal Babes,” and her avatar even wears a gold “Miles” necklace, as a nod to founder Miles Anthony.  Poker has been part of crypto’s history since its inception.  If you want to view the glass as half full, this is an encouraging example of a virtuous cycle where NFT communities can spawn sub-communities, and creators inspire more creators. If inclined to view the glass as half empty … This all feels pretty far removed from reality.  Meanwhile, every day, Raeon rakes in passive income from her delegates. She now has 10 wearables that she loans to five players, all of whom give her a small but steady stream of revenue. “I’m a small fish,” she quickly clarifies. “There are people out there with 20 or 30 [wearables.] They’re kingpins.”  It’s unlikely, however, that these kingpins are getting filthy rich. Just look at Iceyyy. He’s one of the game’s most admired and prolific players. On Twitter, Iceyyy disclosed that in the past three months he played 152 hours of poker, earning him 95,000 ICE. This translates to $1,660. That works out to $10.89 per hour, or less than New York’s minimum wage.  This brings us to ICE Poker’s big catch, and in crypto there’s always a catch.  For most of 2022 the value of the casino’s native token, ICE, has plummeted. In December 2021, each ICE token was worth around 20 cents. It’s now worth about a penny. (At its peak value, Iceyyy would be earning over $200 per hour playing the game that he loves.) This means that players earn less and less from the ICE payouts, something you hear users grumble about on the Discord. One player asks, “Guys why the ICE price keeps dropping?” Another: “Game is going to survive I guess but we definitely going lower.”  Read More: Atari Partners on Crypto Casino in Ethereum-Based Virtual World  This gets to the fundamental question of play-to-earn games: Are they sustainable models? What was once the most celebrated play-to-earn game in crypto, Axie Infinity, is now viewed by some as a cautionary tale, and it’s not entirely clear how the “free” rewards can indefinitely gush to the players.  Anthony is all too aware of the concerns. “With any play-to-earn game, you have to understand that the token you’re earning is inflationary,” says Anthony. The more players play, the more ICE tokens flood into the ecosystem, which makes those very tokens less valuable.  That can’t go on forever, and if left unchecked the value of ICE could continue to drop and players like Iceyyy might decide it’s simply no longer worth their time. Raeon’s delegates would stop playing and they’d likely stop partying. The feel-good vibes only last when there’s easy money.  So Anthony and team are rolling out policies they view as “deflationary,” such as burning ICE (which reduces the supply) and launching new “Sit and Go” tournaments, which require 1,000 ICE to join ($10 at today’s prices) and effectively remove ICE from circulation. “It’s a constant battle between inflation and deflation,” says Anthony, who can sound less like a 20-something nomad and more like a policy wonk at the Federal Reserve.  He knows the price is a problem, he knows the game’s friction (like the Delegates chat) is a problem, and he knows that lack of access is a problem. You still need a desktop computer to enter Decentraland, so Anthony plans to launch a mobile version of the game. “We see this as more aligned with a Zygna poker type of product,” he says, then clarifies that he means free poker. If he could reach Zygna-level adoption? Anthony figures that would translate to 20 or 30 million active users, “and the amount of value you could generate for the community is much larger than a casino.”  Which brings us back to that curious positioning of ICE Poker: Not quite a casino! So much of crypto feels like a casino: Buying and trading bitcoin can feel like a casino. Buying packs of NBA Top Shot and hoping you get lucky can feel like a casino. Spending money on NFTs can feel like a casino. The only place in crypto that does not feel like a casino, ultimately, is the crypto casino.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MANA | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/08/29/the-metaverse-casino-that-wasnt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71b9cfdbb3b0bc8e61f21e2ddf53a14041c3f761-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That said, every identity contains multiple personas, our moral compasses are not carved in stone and after trying so hard to be good IRL it can be fun to be bad for a bit in your favorite internet cesspool.  After all, the internet has long served as a liberating outlet for people to do what they want and be who they want. Early internet chat rooms were bastions of individual expression (and chaos). With the rise of immersive gaming and metaversal experiences, people now have even more ways to explore every aspect of their personality and interests, including their dark side.  Steven Na is the executive producer of Human Park. a consumer-first metaverse entertainment company. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Sin Week.""  Of course, aberrant behavior is not relegated to the metaverse. The regular internet is awash in a sea of sexual harassment, hate speech and illegal content, and people can be disturbingly creative when it comes to leveraging technology to abuse one another.  This is especially alarming in the metaverse, given some people report feeling phantom sensations when their metaversal selves are accosted. It’s no surprise then, that bodily harassment directed towards online avatars often feels more traumatic than verbal harassment on traditional social media platforms.  Read more: What Happens if You’re Sexually Assaulted in the Metaverse? / Opinion  It’s worth remembering that not all online environments operate under the same moral framework, and the terms “good” and “bad” are highly contextual. As the concept of “the metaverse” continues to evolve beyond virtual reality gaming, and as digital communities begin to form, we need to be mindful of the difference between actual Web3 games versus “gamified” social forums, and agree on what types of behavior each should allow.  Moral ambiguity in media  In the realm of online gaming, I say the badder, the better. When it comes to mainstream entertainment, we are in the era of the antihero, where on-screen baddies are often just as relatable as the good guys.  Likewise video games increasingly let players explore their own moral ambiguity. Video games enable novel forms of self-exploration and catharsis since they present players with a spectrum of choices instead of just passive entertainment.  And in these fictional worlds, many people choose to do some pretty crazy stuff. After all, the internet is a rebalancing of indulgence and consequence, and in-game indulgences almost always outweigh their consequences.  Sure, not everyone enjoys being the bad guy in a video game, and that’s totally natural and acceptable. But an academic study on “Moral Choice in Video Games” argues that morally ambiguous gameplay opens the doors to a “cognitive abandonment of moral concerns, which allows players to enjoy games even when they are expected or required to perform morally reprehensible acts.”  When it comes to gaming you don’t have to be a real-life villain to want to occasionally lay siege to a fictional kingdom. However, just because gaming metaverses aren’t meant to reflect real life doesn’t mean there aren’t some interesting comparisons.  Real life  Leo Tolstoy famously said that “all happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” That could just as easily apply to our “happy” and “unhappy” daily interactions in the sense that it’s easier to think of a million ways to ruin someone’s day than come up with several ways to brighten it. This is only heightened by the metaverse.  Cosplaying as the bad guy in an online game can often provide players more optionality and freedom, because being the “good guy” often leads to narrower goals and play styles.  Of course, whether or not a player has more optionality as a hero or a villain is dependent on how a game is set up. This is especially true in an open-world setting where there are infinitely more potential player actions and outcomes than the original game developers foresaw.  This explorative approach to gameplay arguably immerses players in a broader range of perspectives and requires a higher degree of moral sensitivity – even though players know their choices are ultimately inconsequential in real life. We know that what happens in-game isn’t real. It helps us disengage from the heavier choices we’re often faced with and lets us explore life from a different point of view, seemingly free of consequences. And so, deviant in-game behavior often takes on an air of wanton self-indulgence.  But there are other metaverses that are designed to mirror real life more closely. While many of these entail certain gamified experiences, it’s fair to say that these environments are perceived as more “real” and should be dictated by something more in line with traditional morality, as opposed to what’s permitted in a purely escapist metaverse.  Design decisions  As people’s identities and lived experiences shift online and start feeling more “real,” the consequences of our online decisions will grow heavier. And with companies like OWO and H2L creating sensory devices that allow users to feel everything from a warm embrace to a gunshot wound in the metaverse, there’s a chance that even in-game actions will grow more consequential over time.  Some people have argued that an ethical metaverse will require the help of trustworthy AI moderators, but blockchain networks are literally designed to run on sustainable incentive systems tailored to specific use cases. Other technologies will undoubtedly play a role in supplementing and augmenting on-chain projects, but at the end of the day the onus is on us to design the overarching incentive systems that prioritize fun and safety.  Read more: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About the Metaverse (but Were Afraid to Ask)  Blockchain-based platforms have the advantage of letting users customize their digital avatars and other assets through active gameplay, and retain true ownership of their evolving online identity in a very real sense. This means that whether you’re an online hero, a baddie or something in between, when it comes to the metaverse you will be a unique, one-of-a-kind entity that continues to exist even after you switch off your device – just like in the real world.  So to all you citizens of the metaverse, I encourage you to be mindful of whether you’re participating in an escapist game or an extension of real life – and enjoy being devious without affecting others in any genuinely harmful ways. After all, calling someone an expletive can be much more damaging and consequential in one virtual setting than cutting someone’s head off in another.

42422497,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lUrh,1661764652,Crypto Coin AVAX Drops 11% After Self-Described Whistleblower Says Avalanche Weaponized Litigation Against Rivals,"The AVAX token dropped to its lowest price since July 13 on Monday after a self-described ""whistleblower"" website accused that Ava Labs, the company behind the Avalanche blockchain, paid lawyers to hurt competitors and keep regulators at bay.  On Friday, Crypto Leaks, a self-proclaimed whistleblower, published a report saying that some years ago New York-based Ava Labs focused on developing Avalanche's ecosystem, and law firm Roche Freedman made a deal under which Freedman would collect confidential information of rival companies and trap them under class-action lawsuits in return for massive amounts of AVAX tokens and Ava Labs corporate stock.  The report said:  ""We can reveal that the pact directs Roche Freedman and their leader Kyle Roche, to: 1) use the American legal system - gangster style - to attack and harm crypto organizations and projects that might compete with Ava Labs or Avalanche in some way, 2) sue crypto industry actors generally with the aim of creating magnets for regulators such as the SEC and CFTC that distract them from the highly commercial nature of Ava Labs and the Avalanche blockchain, and 3) secretly pursue Emin Gün Sirer's personal vendettas against individuals.""  AVAX has dropped 22% from $23 to $17.90 since Friday – with prices losing 11% in the past 24 hours alone, according to CoinDesk data. As of this writing, AVAX was the only cryptocurrency with a market cap of at least $1 billion to report a double-digit percentage decline for the 24-hour period. At press time, bitcoin, ether and other major cryptocurrencies nursed 1% to 5% losses.  Emin Gün Sirer, Ava Labs founder and CEO, dismissed the piece as ""conspiracy theory nonsense.""  The report, however, has caught the eye of industry bigwigs, with some in the investor community calling the report disturbing while others wondering whether both parties will now face legal scrutiny for perverse incentive relationship.  Meanwhile, in a now-deleted tweet, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao called the report ""wild,"" assuming the legitimacy of the evidence videos published by Crypto Leaks. Zhao said Binance was the target even though the centralized exchange isn't a direct competitor of Avalanche.  Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, wrote on Twitter Monday that he had ""never met or spoken to (much less invested in) Kyle Roche,"" in response to a claim in the Crypto Leaks article that Garlinghouse had done so.  Avalanche gained prominence with other layer 1 blockchains last year, thanks to high transaction costs on the Ethereum blockchain. AVAX surged a whopping 3,300% in 2021, hitting record highs above $140.  The token peaked with the broader market in November as the U.S. Federal Reserve shifted focus to inflation control and monetary tightening. Since then, the cryptocurrency market valuation has declined from $3 trillion to less than $1 trillion. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell below $20,000 early Monday, having reached a record high of $69,000 in November.

42422483,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lUNh,1661761680,"Singapore's Central Bank Wants to Foster Digital Assets, Restrict Crypto Speculation","Singapore's central bank wants to promote a digital asset ecosystem while restricting crypto speculation, said Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).  Menon insisted that this stance is not contradictory during his opening remarks at a Green Shoots Seminar on Monday. Green Shoots sessions are used to make announcements and introduce products and policies to the financial services community.  The MAS, along with other regulators in the country, have been cracking down on the local crypto space with renewed vigor after a number of high-profile crypto firms with ties to Singapore – including Three Arrows Capital and Vauld – collapsed earlier this year.  In particular the MAS is looking to strengthen protections for retail crypto investors in the country – something Menon reinforced during his Monday speech.  According to Menon, while the digital asset ecosystem uses blockchain, distributed ledger technology and tokenization to allow ""anything of value to be represented in digital form, and to be stored and exchanged on a ledger that keeps an immutable record of all transactions"" cryptocurrencies are just ""heavily speculated upon"" while their prices ""have nothing to do with any underlying economic value.""  ""Cryptocurrencies have taken a life of their own outside of the distributed ledger and this is the source of the crypto world’s problems,"" Menon said.  The MAS is instead focusing on actively promoting the digital asset ecosystem that encompasses the tokenization of financial assets like cash and bonds, real assets like artwork and property, and intangible items like carbon credits and computing resources.  ""I hope this presentation has made clear that MAS’ facilitative posture on digital asset activities and restrictive stance on cryptocurrency speculation are not contradictory. It is in fact a synergistic and holistic approach to develop Singapore as an innovative and responsible global digital asset hub,"" Menon said.

The block utilization rate is 50.9%, the destruction rate is 0.26 ETH/min, and the BaseFee is 3.6GWei. There are 2,600,156.6 pieces totaling around 3.9 billion US dollars. However, the overall amount of ETH in Deposit contracts has dropped to a one-month low, according to Glassnode data. ETH Merge Behind the Price Rise Due to the euphoria surrounding the Merge upgrade, the price of ETH sharply increased. ETH gained more than 90% from the $1,000 low in June before retreating. The macro factors have overshadowed the optimism of the Merge improvement. Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, stated last week that the institution would not hesitate to continue raising interest rates. Powell emphasized that the inflation rate is still too high for the typical consumer even if it decreases. Thus, more quantitative tightening measures might significantly increase the pressure on the share and cryptocurrency markets. The rising S&amp;P 500-Ethereum correlation may also affect the price of ETH.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether traded down over the weekend.  Insights: Analysts saw Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech for what it was: an unbridled commitment to tame inflation.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin Falls Below $20K  By James Rubin  After clinging tenaciously to support above $20,000 for much of the weekend, bitcoin fell well below this threshold late Sunday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $19,600, down more than 2% over the previous 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands at roughly $1,430, down more than 4% as investors continued to chew over U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's vow to continue the monetary hawkishness the Fed adopted earlier this year.  That news disappointed some investors hoping for signs of Fed confidence that its steps the last few months were taming inflation and that it might back away from its recent diet of 75 basis point interest rate hikes.  ""The macroeconomic uncertainties continued to weigh on the price of BTC, and while the [Personal Consumption Expenditures] data came in negative (giving market hopes that the Fed could take a less aggressive stance moving forward), [the] Fed chair's talk on Friday dashed those hopes as he cautioned against premature policy loosening,"" Joe DiPasquale of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital wrote to CoinDesk. ""The market has reacted negatively to those comments and we're seeing bitcoin testing the $20,000 support.""  Most other major cryptos were recently in the red, with AVAX and ATOM down more than 9% and 6%, respectively. XMR rose about a percentage point.  On Friday, bitcoin fell precipitously from the $21,000 perch it held throughout the working week as Powell noted that inflation remains a serious threat. He said that ""reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth"" that would create ""softer labor markets,"" among other impacts.  The ongoing strength of the job market has suggested repeatedly that the economy has not fallen into recession. The 3.5% unemployment rate is the lowest level since February 2020. ""While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,"" Powell said.  “We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2%,” Powell said.  Equities and crypto news  Cryptos in the late week fall tracked equity markets, which closed substantially lower on Friday, with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 plunging nearly 4% and 3.3%, respectively.  In recent crypto industry news :  Japan is preparing to review existing corporate crypto tax rates in an effort to entice startups to remain in the country, local news outlet Yomiuri reported. Japan's financial services agency (FSA) and the ministry of economy, trade and industry are considering a tax reform proposal for 2023 that could exempt crypto startups that issue their own tokens from paying taxes on unrealized gains.  Over the weekend, CoinDesk reported that Grayscale Investments LLC has been fielding questions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the firm’s “securities law analysis” of tokens in some of its less-popular crypto trusts. The inquiry, which Grayscale disclosed in little-noticed filings made in June and mid-August, casts a shadow over the trusts’ viability at a time when the world’s largest digital asset manager is already dealing with a precipitous decline in its assets’ value due to the ongoing crypto winter.  Grayscale Investments is a digital asset management firm owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.  BitBull's DiPasquale wrote that ""Monday's opening for equities will be key, as any more downside there could push BTC toward the recent lows.""  ""We will be watching for the market's reactions to new lows and aiming to accumulate BTC between $20,000 and $15,000,"" he wrote.  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.

They also draw some of the strongest reactions by analysts, investors and others who make a living observing monetary policy and the economy.  Even by these standards, Jerome Powell's remarks at the Fed's Economic Symposium on Friday drew particular attention, coming amid a flood of often confounding economic indicators, including July's decline in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) suggesting that inflation, which reached a 40-year high the previous month, was waning. Would Powell be a hawk, or signal a softening in interest rate hikes?  He sharpened his claws.  In the strongest terms, Powell said that inflation remained a menace to economic well-being and that the Fed would continue raising rates. “We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done,” he said.  Here's how a few commentators from major research and financial services groups view Powell's comments and the likely future impact of ongoing monetary hawkishness:  “They won’t want to be remembered as the central bank that missed inflation or even spurred inflation higher,” said Brian O’Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum International Funds, told The Wall Street Journal.  “The process won’t be painless, and I think he’s being more upfront about that,” said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research, told The New York Times. “The likelihood of recession is rising, because that’s the solution to the inflation problem – that’s what they’re telling you.”  Powell is not budging on having restrictive policy and that should mean the economy will steadily weaken going forward,"" Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email. Powell drove home the point that when they are done raising rates that we should expect them to stay there for a long period of time ... There was no dovish pivot, but it seems financial markets are getting close to fully pricing in the remaining Fed rate hikes.""  “In essence, Powell is clearly stating that right now, fighting inflation is more important than supporting growth,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, told CNBC.
