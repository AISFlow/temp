One that has been destroyed by excessive speculative fervor and easy access to cheap capital. Bitcoin Rebound Is A Matter Of Time Sharma, a New York Times bestselling author and former emerging markets investor at Morgan Stanley (MS), predicted that bitcoin could experience a comeback similar to that of Amazon. Amazon&apos;s value fell by about 90% during the early 2000s dot-com collapse but increased by more than 300 times over the course of the following 20+ years. Although Sharma agrees that there may be more turbulence for bitcoin and the larger world of digital assets over the next months, this may also serve to remove weak players from the market. Some claim that has already occurred. According to him, Bitcoin is still &apos;caught up in this speculative mania,&apos; and is still indicating a partial worldwide collapse. He brought up the Amazon incident again, noting that it took the company some time to recover. The shares of the online store needed some time to match and surpass its frothy 1999 level.

The digital world is restructuring, internally, as firms fail or firms weaken, and others, producing and with cash, move to acquire and consolidate what has already evolved. This consolidation is going to play a major role, one that investors can use the knowledge and information generated over the past five-to-ten years. The stage is part of the historical cycle industries go through as they grow and learn, generating more and more useful information to help make better and better decisions. The next stage in the evolution of digital currencies has apparently arrived. Consolidation. Paul Vigna writes in the Wall Street Journal : ""A blowout in the cryptocurrency market sparked a wave of layoffs, punished valuations and drove some companies to bankruptcy."" ""Now firms that still have capital are gearing for a shopping spree."" This is what happens in ""new"" markets. ""Crypto"" went a long time where valuations stayed low and investors were sitting around, waiting for some kind of break out for the industry. Then it happened, with a lot of thanks to the Federal Reserve system. The Federal Reserve pumped lots and lots of money into the financial system. Valuations took off. From the twenty-teens when the total valuations for the industry remained under or around $1.0 trillion, valuations rose. By early November 2021, the total market valuation was put at over $3.2 trillion. Bitcoin itself reached a price of more than $67,000 on November 8, 2021. It seemed as if just about everyone in the industry was on a merry-go-round ride. And, then reality hit, as it always does sooner or later. The Federal Reserve pulled out the rug from under the thriving bunch of newcomers. Losses mounted. The industry valuation dropped to around $1.0 trillion. The price of Bitcoin dropped below $20,000. Employee layoffs occurred. Firms pulled back and shrank in size. And, firms began to restructure their operations. Some, those that seemed to be thriving and had access to cash, began to buy out those organizations that appeared to have a real future but were weakened by the falloff of the industry. The next period of the evolution of the digital world began. FTX The crypto exchange FTX is one such survivor. Founded and run by Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX has been one of the new leaders in the digital world as it kept its distance from the ""libertarian"" crowd that played a big role in the early development of the industry. Mr. Bankman-Fried wanted to be open and work with regulators. Mr. Bankman-Fried wanted to play a role in creating the future of the industry, which meant working with and helping others to survive and to build where there was strength. Mr. Vigna cites the acquisition made by FTX of BlockFi as one of the examples of the evolving industry. FTX also acquired a minority stake in the now-bankrupt Voyager Digital Ltd. So the movement was on. Company failures grew, beginning early in May. The Next Stage Firms with money or firms that can obtain money are the next to move. There were 23 M&A deals in April, 20 in May, and 17 in June. Furthermore, venture capital is also moving in the area as they see the opportunity to obtain valuable assets at a cheap price so that they can resale them at a later date. In April, there were 249 deals, with 180 more in May, and 157 more in June. And, in terms of industry change, more and more badly damaged firms are dropping out altogether. As Mr. Vigna adds, ""That leaves the field more open to the survivors."" The bottom line? Chris Lehane, chief strategy officer of venture fund Haun Ventures, is quoted as saying, ""We had almost a decade of free money."" ""Now people are going to need to demonstrate they have real ideas."" Furthermore, regulators are going to have to respond with effective and sensible regulation. In this sense, industry leaders like Sam Bankman-Fried, are going to play a much more important part as they work with the regulatory side to build the most effective regulatory structure in the world. As I have written earlier , an industry without regulation is a ""dream"" that is based on assumptions that do not exist in the real world. One of the assumptions libertarians hang onto is that the world works with complete information. Thus, everyone knows everything and so regulators are not needed because an information-rich market can police itself. To me, this is a far-piece from reality. Investors, the world, only work with incomplete information and so some participating in this world can take advantage of others. Regulation is needed...and will be forthcoming sooner or later. Mr. Bankman-Fried appears to understand this and so is willing to work with the regulatory sector to build the best set of regulators that will allow for as much freedom as possible, but also serve to make sure that people behave according to the rules. The Digital World As I have written before, the world is going digital. We just don't know what the next era is going to look like. And, that is what we are evolving through right now. We had a period of fantastic growth, underwritten by the Federal Reserve system. Now, the industry is moving along. There is still lots of restructuring to do. There is still a lot of innovation to be added. There is a lot of management needed to produce the best that can be attained. This is just the next stage in the process. And, there will be lots of money that investors will make supporting the new world structure. But, the investment will not just be ""throwing money at the wall to see what sticks."" We have some history now. We have some experience with the industry and its managers. We have suffered from its exuberance. Now, we move on. But, we now have some history to work with. Investors need to make good use of this history.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4522775-digital-currencies-the-next-stage?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/846.jpeg

As staking returns should to be in the high single digits, longer-term institutional investors may look to stake ETH once the uncertainty created by the lock up period is removed. Depending on the gas prices, transaction fee burns may be larger than the staking rewards, making the system slightly deflationary after The Merge. Interest rate policy is driving price action in the digital asset space and there is a close correlation between the Ethereum price decline and the fall in the Nasdaq Composite. Direct policy firming at the final four FOMC meetings of the year may not be as robust as current Fed communications or market expectations now indicate. In December I wrote an article titled: Those Aren't Really Hawks: Ascendant Bitcoin Under Historic Fed Stimulus . The article made three points. First, though there had been a severe shift in Fed members' targets for year-end 2022, the federal funds rate would remain historically low despite the coming hikes. Second, the simple lesson from the FOMC's quantitative easing history is that generally their balance sheet increases and each new phase is more substantial than in prior expansions. Last, that these tendencies over time should be supportive of harder assets in the crypto space with strong tokenomics, especially Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). In December, the average target of FOMC members for year-end 2022 federal funds rate was between .75% and 1% and purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities continued, though at a quickly reducing amount. Now, just six months later, the current rate has already surpassed the prior .75%-1% target and sits between 1.5%-1.75%. And the Fed has surprisingly already begun ramping the runoff of the balance sheet by reducing the amount of principle payments reinvested. Data by YCharts So the whole thesis, that fear and uncertainty surrounding rate hikes and a QE reversal were overblown, has proved substantially wrong. And of course this surprising hawkishness, a reaction to the entrenched and spilling inflation in the energy sector, has meaningfully dragged down risk-on and rate sensitive assets. Further, in the chart above note the close correlation between the Ethereum price decline and the fall in the Nasdaq Composite level during this period of rapidly adjusting outlook in the credit markets. So interest rate policy and the macro environment are driving action in the digital asset space. For Ethereum in particular, the Fed factor has proven more important than news on The Merge, regulation rumblings out of Washington, or issues lower down the altcoin ladder, such as with Terra ( LUNA-USD ). However before considering the all-important Fed policy outlook, the article below briefly reviews The Merge with a focus on how it will undergird Ethereum in the coming year of rate policy adjustment. 2023 Foundations Still Strong: Importance of The Merge Working though changes in plans and delays, The Merge of Ethereum's Mainnet execution layer with its Beacon Chain proof-of-stake consensus mechanism appears imminent. Final practice runs and a litany of fixes on the public testnets are occurring . June's Grey Glacier update pushed back and set the mining difficulty bomb for September. So all signs still point to a third quarter implementation. In the coming weeks this timeline could be confirmed following The Merge on the important Goerli testnet and its aftermath. The Merge is key to price action in the quarters that follow as it increases Ethereum's regulatory moat, could precursor a staking revolution, and meaningfully improves the coin's tokenomics. Even before The Merge, Ethereum has a larger than average moat against direct regulatory action as there is a growing consensus that the coin is a commodity rather a security. Though the recently proposed Responsible Financial Innovation Act is unlikely to pass quicky and in its current form, the bipartisan bill affirms that Ethereum's regulatory authority will fall to the CFTC rather than the SEC. Digital assets that meet the definition of a commodity, such as bitcoin and ether, which comprise more than half of digital asset market capitalization, will be regulated by the CFTC. Source: LUMMIS, GILLIBRAND INTRODUCE LANDMARK LEGISLATION , lummis.senate.gov, 6/7/22 And after The Merge, Ethereum will benefit from having the preferred consensus mechanism from an ESG perspective and therefore also a regulatory perspective. Estimates from the Beacon Chain point to proof-of-stake being ~2000x more energy-efficient than proof-of-work. The Merge may also tend to tighten the supply of Ethereum in two ways. There are currently about 13 million of the total 120 million ETH staking on the Beacon Chain. These ETH are locked and cannot be withdrawn until a cleanup upgrade is instituted following The Merge. Once the cleanup upgrade goes live there will technically be additional tradable supply as the 13 million ETH is unlocked. However, as the staking returns should to be in the high single digits, longer-term institutional investors may look to stake ETH once the uncertainty surrounding the lock up period is removed. This would increase demand and de facto tie up supply. One countervailing consideration... there are questions about what the miners will do with the significant percentage of ETH they are holding. Miner stock prices have fallen, discouraging share sales, and bond financing is now prohibitively expensive. So it is likely a portion of the held supply will come to market to fund mining operations for other coins or tokens. Last, the rate of increase in the supply of Ethereum following The Merge will also drastically fall, and possibly reverse. There will no longer be a two ETH issuance per block to the winning miner in the proof-of-work consensus. Rather, those choosing to stake their coins will be rewarded for securing the platform. The new rewards to those staking will be a fraction of the prior proof-of-work issuance. And note that base fees are now burned. So depending on the gas prices, the fee burns could be larger than the staking rewards, making the system slightly deflationary. So where from here? The Fed and market participants may now be estimating more rate hikes and tightening than will actually be realized in the remainder of 2022. And if the full complement of currently anticipated hikes do not materialize, one could expect this to be generally supportive of tech equities and risk on assets, including crypto. June SEP, Dot Plot (federalreserve.gov) The median FOMC participant has the yearend 2022 federal funds rate between 3.25% and 3.5%. This implies total increases of 1.75% during the next four meetings. Going back to 2000, the largest increase over a similar period totaled 1% and was equally distributed in .25% increments. And for clarity, this will be on top of the 1.5% increase over the prior three meetings. With a tight labor market and sustained core inflation above even the new symmetrical target range, the current situation is substantially different than seen over the past two decades. But still, the size and speed of the current trajectory is extraordinary. Also FOMC participants in the past have expressed concerns about large, swift changes to the rate. And notably one of the more hawkish members, Esther George, surprisingly voted against the .75% increase in June. President George dissented because she judged that a large increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would add to uncertainty about policy concurrent with the beginning of balance sheet runoff in ways that could unsettle households and businesses and could also adversely affect the ability of small banks to meet the credit needs of their communities. Source: Minutes of the FMOC June 14–15, 2022 , federalreserve.gov, 7/6/22 As seen in the graphic below, following the strong June jobs report last Friday, market expectations based on futures prices point to a 95% chance of a .75% increase at this month's meeting, with a small 5% chance of a 1% rise. From my perspective this outlook is an example of how expectations are overweighted to the hawkish side. And there remains a solid, though minority, possibility the Fed only moves .5% and basically zero chance of a 1% raise. The smaller probability .5% increase would only require the coming CPI and retail sales numbers to both deviate from expectations on the low side. Rate Probabilities Post July Meeting (cmegroup.com) For reference the chart below shows market expectations for the federal funds rate at yearend, as a probability, based on futures prices. It can be directly compared to the yellow highlighted Fed SEP dot plot above; it has a highly similar though marginally more hawkish distribution. Target Rate Probabilities Yearend (federalreserve.gov) In the June minutes there is a focus by the Fed on communications and they even directly mention their own credibility. They now appear sensitive to not repeat prior statements about the transitory nature of the inflation or to ever stress the idea that their tools are not well suited for tackling inflation caused supply constraints. Powell has also recently emphasized that controlling high inflation is necessary for sustained max employment; high inflation has been linked to low investment and slower growth. Put differently, the Fed is further bolstering its anti-inflation rhetoric by showing there is not a direct tradeoff in their dual mandate. My highlighting the Fed's focus on communications concerning inflation does not imply they are unserious about using direct policy tools to reduce inflation. But rather that they believe strong talk is a tool in their arsenal as well. Many participants noted that the Committee’s credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objective, together with previous communications, had been helpful in shifting market expectations of future policy and had already contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate demand. Source: Minutes of the FMOC June 14–15, 2022 , federalreserve.gov, 7/6/22 As a bookend to this section, consider the following from Chair Powell. Despite his purposefully hawkish stance, he emphasized: Clearly, today’s 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common. Takeaway Tightened and tightening financial conditions could reduce inflation rates and inflation measures prior to the September Fed meeting. Should this occur, direct policy firming at the final three meetings of the year may not be as robust as current Fed communications or market expectations now indicate. There could even be a pause in hikes prior to reaching the 3.25%-3.5% median yearend target. Further, beyond outlier inflation developments, the max foreseeable policy tightening of another 2.0% in raises is already priced into market expectations. So the opportunity for a shift is to the dovish side. This is generally constructive for expected value calculations in the tech sector and for risk on assets, including Ethereum. In the quarters that follow The Merge, Ethereum will benefit from its new proof-of stake consensus mechanism. Proof-of-stake is ESG and regulator friendly. Because of the relatively high yields, an Ethereum staking revolution is possible once the off-putting lockup requirement is removed in the period following The Merge. And because proof-of-stake does not require the substantial issuance to miners for securing the platform, growth in total supply will drastically flatten following The Merge. I expect positive sentiment in the months leading up to The Merge and that this period neatly coincides with a more favorable macro environment. Assuming Ethereum maintains above $950 and the Nasdaq Composite above 10,800, my target is between $1,400 and $1,480 near the date of The Merge.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4522774-ethereum-forget-luna-gary-gensler-even-merge-fed-is-driving?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/849.jpeg

42422779,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0pb5h,1657570605,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Retraces Gains as Investors Await Inflation Announcement,"Hi, I'm Jimmy He, here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  Bitcoin (BTC) continued to retrace last week’s gains, declining for the fourth straight day toward the psychologically critical price of $20,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was down 1.8% over the past 24 hours, around $20,500.  Although bitcoin surged above $22,000 last week, the cryptocurrency has consistently failed to break out. Still, some analysts are getting more optimistic about a market recovery.  “BTC has never previously fallen below such marks, so it is now getting support from buyers confident in the first cryptocurrency’s long-term growth,” FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said. “Another supportive factor was the rebound in financial markets, where the new half-year was met with increased buying.”  Wednesday's expected release of June’s Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most widely regarded measure of U.S. inflation, may show whether the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy has succeeded in slowing the pace of rising prices. If the increase exceeds investor expectations, traditional and crypto markets may both see another wave of selling that could push bitcoin lower.  EToro market analyst Simon Peters said that eyes are also “firmly on ether” as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization moves towards its Merge and transitions from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.  “While it's impossible to know what effect the move to a proof-of-stake network will have on the crypto-asset price, theoretically it is deflationary as it encourages holders to stake rather than sell their tokens,” Peters said.  Ether (ETH) was down 2.7% over the past 24 hours. Most altcoins were trading in the red today with UNI as the biggest loser, down 8.4%.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $20,495 −1.8%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,141 −2.7%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,854.47 −1.2%      ●Gold: $1,730 per troy ounce −0.6%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.99% −0.1       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Ether, Short-Bitcoin Inflows Continue: CoinShares Report  Crypto fund inflows totaled $15 million in the seven days through July 8, according to a CoinShares report.  Over half of that, some $7.6 million, was attributed to ether-focused funds, for the third consecutive week of inflows. A cold streak for ether funds earlier this year had pushed cumulative outflows to $460 million.  “The inflows suggest a modest turn-around in sentiment, having endured 11 consecutive weeks of outflows,"" according to the report.  CoinShares suggested in the report that an improvement in Ethereum network sentiment may be due to the approaching Merge, where the blockchain network moves from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.  Last week, Ethereum successfully transitioned its Sepolia test environment network (test-net) to proof-of-stake, moving the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization one step closer to its own Merge.  Short-bitcoin investment products – those betting on a price decline in the largest cryptocurrency – saw inflows totaling $6.3 million, a sweeping decline from the $51 million of inflows seen last week. Short-bitcoin outperformed traditional bitcoin investment products, which saw outflows totaling $1.7 million.  Altcoin funds were stagnant, with minor outflows totaling $300,000.  Regionally, North America accounted for the majority of inflows, with U.S. inflows totaling $8.2 million and Canadian inflows totaling $7.1 million.

42422770,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0panh,1657570237,Voyager Clarifies USD Deposit Status in Update,"In an update posted Monday morning, Voyager – the crypto exchange platform that declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy last week – assured customers that its “FDIC insured” USD deposits would be returned in full, pending a “reconciliation and fraud prevention process.”  Crypto investments are a different story, and under the firm’s proposed restructuring plan, it remains unclear exactly how customers will be refunded for those assets held with the platform.  Voyager ran into trouble late last month thanks to a loan of about $650 million to Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, a major crypto hedge fund that collapsed in June. According to a New York court filing, 3AC – which was forced to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month in the British Virgin Islands – is not cooperating with liquidators.  Voyager since has been forced to suspend all trading, deposits and withdrawals, and file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In addition to crypto investments held on the platform, the withdrawal suspension affects all U.S. dollar deposits – even if those funds were never used to buy or sell crypto.  Per Voyager’s update on Monday, the firm “currently has approximately $1.3 billion of crypto assets on its platform, plus claims against Three Arrows Capital ('3AC') of more than $650 million (it fluctuates due to the exchange rate between bitcoin and USD).”  Customer refund process  Voyager, which is helmed by CEO Steve Ehrlich, explained how its reorganization plan, which it proposed in court last week, will affect depositors:  “Customers will receive a combination of the following, with the ability to select the proportion of crypto and common equity they receive, subject to certain maximum thresholds: pro-rata share of crypto; pro-rata share of proceeds from the 3AC recovery; pro-rata share of common shares in the newly reorganized company and pro-rata share of existing Voyager tokens.”  Voyager clarified in its update that the reorganization plan is still subject to change, and the exact amounts that customers receive will “depend on what happens in the restructuring process and the recovery of 3AC assets.”  FDIC claims  Voyager’s update came after a report that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation launched a probe into the firm, surrounding its claim that customer USD deposits were “FDIC insured.”  In its marketing material, Voyager previously claimed that dollar deposits were FDIC-insured in the event of Voyager’s collapse – meaning users would be refunded up to $250,000 in the event of the exchange’s failure.  Customer dollars were actually on deposit with FDIC-insured Metropolitan Commercial Bank (MCB), meaning the insurance protected against a MCB failure, not a Voyager failure. Nevertheless, says Voyager, USD deposits are protected as the money is with MCB, not Voyager.  Voyager also said that it “worked with the FDIC in early 2021 and again in early 2022 to update and clarify the language on its website.”  “USD in your Voyager cash account is held at MCB and is FDIC insured,"" Voyager added. ""That means you are covered in the event of MCB’s failure, up to a maximum of $250,000 per Voyager customer. FDIC insurance does not protect against the failure of Voyager, but to be clear: Voyager does not hold customer cash, that cash is held at MCB.”  CoinDesk has reached out to Voyager and MCB for comment.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/11/voyager-clarifies-usd-deposit-concerns-in-update,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b8625e247af246ec183b3a0d5c921a8340d3cbe-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
871,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4522759-why-bitcoin-volatility-points-to-uptrend?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1657570110,Why Bitcoin's Volatility Could Be Part Of A Larger Uptrend (Technical Analysis),"As long as Bitcoin holds the $14,650 level, we believe that the volatility that we have been experiencing since November 2021 is part of a larger uptrend. It’s important to keep in perspective that over the last 10+ years, BTC transactions and adoption has been on a steady upward trend with minor pullbacks along the way. If Bitcoin can break above the $21,650 level, and sustain a push above this region, the odds will further favor the start of a final 5th wave push higher. In August of 2019 we released our first premium report on Bitcoin (BTC-USD). At the time, Bitcoin was trading between $10,000-$11,000, following a bounce greater than 200% in less than a year. We believed Bitcoin had provided strong evidence that a meaningful low was put in, and that a new bull cycle was starting. In our premium report, we stated that we expect a drawdown to at least the $7800 region, and that we would wait for this to happen before starting a position. More importantly, we were targeting the $65,000-$75,000 region in the coming year. Here’s a snapshot of our 2019 report: Chart Made by Author This was a bold call at the time, -- and yet the call materialized. The same system we used to target the $65,000 region in 2019 is the same system we are using to target the $88,000 - $110,000 region in the next uptrend. We work in probabilities, and therefore manage risk accordingly. As long as any additional weakness in Bitcoin holds the $14,650 level, we believe that the volatility that we have been experiencing since November 2021 is part of a larger uptrend, with the stated targets currently in place. Technical Analysis and Bitcoin Bitcoin has no earnings reports, management overhauls, or supply chain disruptions that can affect its price. In other words, there isn’t a lot of news that moves the crypto market, yet this particular market moves all day and all night. It’s human nature to assume that a news event is the cause, yet this is simply not the case with crypto. Human sentiment is the primary driver of the crypto space, which is why technical analysis works particularly well. Anytime humans come together in a codified arena and begin trading an asset with their instinct for security as the primary driver, patterns develop across price history. This is what we are measuring. One of the simplest patterns to measure is that an uptrend moves in 5 waves up, then corrects in a 3 waves pattern down. Once we get 5 waves up and 3 down, we then repeat this pattern. As of now, since the 2018 low, we only have 4 waves in place, which implies that we have one more 5th wave push before the larger bull cycle is over. Chart Made by Author As long as any additional weakness holds the $14,650 level, then the above setup is still intact, which is targeting the $88,000 region at a minimum. However, below $14,650 and the probabilities shift that the current bull cycle is over. This means that the above 5 wave structure would fail, and we would need to see a larger reset at lower levels to start a new bull cycle. This is a crucial caveat to risk manage the potential of a renewed uptrend, and also sets up an attractive risk/reward at current prices. Steps to Confirming a Low When confirming a low, there’s a specific criterion I am looking for. The first of which is do we have a complete corrective structure in place? Corrections tend to move in 3 waves, where the final wave down unfolds into a 5 wave structure, tends to be relatively dramatic, and is met with very negative sentiment. Chart Made by Author As you can see above, we have a 3 wave correction where the final C wave is a clean 5 wave structure that unfolded in a waterfall-style event. Furthermore, regarding sentiment, the crypto fear/greed index has been in extreme fear for well over a month. In fact, on June 19th the reading was at a 6, which is one of the lowest readings in its history. Chart Made by Author So, the first step is in place. Can we extend lower? Of course, but the structure is already quite stretched. Next, I want to see a clean 5 wave bounce off the low. The reason for this is that uptrends move in 5 wave patterns. This is also fractal, so a small 5 wave pattern builds into a larger one, and so on until you have reached your target. So, a micro 5 waves off a low suggests that we are starting a new uptrend. Chart Made by Author As you can see above, we do have 5 waves off the low in black, followed by a 3 wave retrace that holds the low. As long as any retrace holds the $19,000 support, the micro 5 waves off the low remain intact. Below $19,000 and it opens the door to lower lows, and will also take us closer to the critical $14,650 support. So, we have 5 waves up and 3 down, and this is now building into a larger 5 wave structure. If correct we have our first larger wave in place as well as our 2nd. The final step is that I want to see a breakout above the top of the larger first wave, which is at $21,650. This typically looks like a cup and handle pattern, and we will need to see a sustained break above this region. A push above this level, and the odds begin to increase substantially that we are beginning the final 5th wave in the larger uptrend. The U.S. Dollar and Bitcoin Another interesting correlation is between the Dollar Index (DXY) and Bitcoin. Many will argue that DXY is not a true representation of the USD, and that a trade weighted index is more appropriate. However, the correlation is not far off, and there is much more price history in DXY to analyze than in the trade weighted dollar. For this reason, DXY provides a meaningful correlation comparison to monitor because when the dollar is strong, Bitcoin is weak and vice versa. Chart Made by Author The above chart is comparing the US Dollar Index in green to Bitcoin. Note the inverse correlation. As the USD strengthens, Bitcoin weakens, and vice versa. As of now, DXY is in a complex topping process, and I believe is lining up with the renewed uptrend in Bitcoin. Chart Made by Author The above chart shows DXY signaling its first weekly divergence since its last top. When you see price make a higher high, while the momentum indicator below makes a lower high, it tends to signal that momentum is fading. This tends to precede tops, which is showing up now. Relative Strength Index The Relative Strength Index (""RSI"") is a way to measure the buying/selling pressure within a trend. In other words, it’s a way to measure the health of a trend and can provide early warning signs of a reversal. On a weekly chart, Bitcoin recently hit the most oversold conditions since 2011. Historically, when bitcoin’s RSI moves below 30, it tends to mark a larger low is being put in place. In June, Bitcoin’s weekly RSI hit 25, which is lower than the 2017 bubble popping and subsequent 84% drawdown that followed. This is significant because what we have is a Negative RSI Reversal pattern happening on a large scale. This is when the RSI makes a lower low, while price makes a higher low. This pattern tends to occur in uptrends, which I believe Bitcoin is in an uptrend on a large degree. Chart Made by Author These are all positive signals, but Bitcoin still has a lot of work to do in order to signal a meaningful low is in place. For example, price has history and so does the RSI. The weekly RSI tends to revolve around the 54 region. Most uptrends will hold this region and turn back up, while the opposite is true in downtrends. Chart Made by Author Note the blue arrows above. These are instances where dips within a larger uptrend hold the 54 region on the RSI, and then turn back up. These are the best regions to Buy the Dip. On the other hand, in periods of significant weakness, that 54 region acts as resistance. The 54 region would flip to be areas where you would sell the rip. Note how the last red arrow marked the resistance just before the larger waterfall event happened in Bitcoin’s recent drawdown. This level will need to be reclaimed before any renewed strength can be shrugged off as just a bear market bounce. Right now, bitcoin’s weekly RSI is just over 30, so it has a lot of work to do. In conclusion, as long as we maintain over $14,650, the larger structure suggests that Bitcoin has one more push higher in the current bull cycle. With the USD starting to show signs of topping out, this lines up with the technical signals we are seeing in Bitcoin, which is suggesting a trend reversal is underway. Furthermore, it’s important to recognize how much Bitcoin has scaled in late 2020 - 2022. Bitcoin last traded in the $19,000 region in December of 2020 as well as December of 2017. While the focus recently has been on BTC’s price decline, it’s important to keep in perspective that over the last 10+ years, BTC transactions and adoption has been on a steady upward trend with minor pullbacks along the way. Chart Made by Author We can also see user adoption is increasing by monitoring the number of Bitcoin wallets in circulation. Chart Made by Author Therefore, despite the immense fear in the marketplace, we believe Bitcoin can sustain a higher price than its previous all-time high if the technicals we outlined above remain intact. As stated, it’s important to recognize that the probabilities favor a 5th wave push higher. This is coming off the heels of a very stretched and complete corrective structure and sentiment that is notably worse than the 2018 low. If Bitcoin can break above the $21,650 level, and sustain a push above this region, the odds will further favor the start of a final 5th wave push higher.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4522759-why-bitcoin-volatility-points-to-uptrend?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/871.jpeg

Bitcoin Exchange Leverage Ratio Has Been Going Up In Recent Weeks As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC all exchanges leverage ratio is still quite high, suggesting that the crypto could still see further downtrend. The &apos;leverage ratio&apos; is an indicator that is defined as the ratio between the open interest and the all derivatives exchange reserve. Here, the &apos;open interest&apos; is a measure of the total amount of Bitcoin futures positions currently open in the derivatives market. And the &apos;derivatives exchange reserve&apos; is just the total number of coins currently stored in wallets of all derivatives exchanges. What the leverage ratio tells us is how much leverage users are taking on average in the BTC futures market right now. When the value of this indicator is high, it means users are taking a large amount of risk in the form of leverage at the moment. An excess of leverage usually leads to higher volatility in the market.

If prices are above critical support levels, the uptrend might resume. Raydium Technical Analysis Raydium token bulls are firmly in charge. Even though there are signs of weakness and bears reversing the gains of July 9, the uptrend is valid. In the short term, the primary support is at the middle BB (the dynamic support line) and $0.70. Therefore, traders may load on every pullback, targeting last week&apos;s highs at $0.83 and later $1.05 if bulls press on. Conversely, RAY crypto may tank towards 2022 lows if prices drop below the middle BB with rising trading volumes. In that case, the coin may drop to $0.60 in a bear continuation formation. What to Expect from RAY? From the RAY technical analysis, buyers still have a chance. However, the reversal of July 9 gains may slow down optimistic bulls in the short term. Thus far, the immediate support is $0.70. For the uptrend to be valid, prices must hold above this level.The post Raydium Technical Analysis: RAY Buy Trigger At $0.83 appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,USDT | RAY,ICO | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | RAY,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/raydium-technical-analysis-ray-buy-trigger-at-0-83/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=raydium-technical-analysis-ray-buy-trigger-at-0-83,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
42422775,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0paph,1657563678,A Saudi Arabia-Themed NFT Collection Is the Latest Free-to-Mint Hit,"Another week, another hit collection of pricy non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The latest star? A project called The Saudis.  The collection of 5,555 NFTs, whose artwork is a derivative of the famed CryptoPunks collectibles, were free to mint on July 9 and sold out within hours.  The project’s floor price (which is the price of the cheapest edition currently for sale on the open market) is around 0.75 ether (roughly $867), after peaking at around 1.3 ETH (roughly $1,650) on Saturday.  The collection has so far totalled 6,700 ETH (roughly $7.7 million) in sales volume since its mint, the most of any project during that span.  The project’s momentum is fueled by its “kingdom” of Twitter followers, many of whom create Saudi Arabia-inspired meme videos to fuel the project’s hype.  The pseudonymous (and at times offensive) founding team behind the project is just the latest in a string of free-to-mint, performance art-driven NFT projects of this nature.  Goblintown is the most notable of the bunch, which did over $7 million in sales volume in its first weekend. The project kept its momentum going with goblin noise-filled Twitter Spaces and influencer partnerships, most recently taking over NFT.NYC with a slew of ghoul-themed parties.  Controversy  Like the performance art-driven projects that have come before it, The Saudis’s first few days on the market weren’t without some controversy, most notably from a bot created to artificially lower the floor price, which the team eventually banned.  The release also came with its fair share of NFT influencer drama, with fingers being pointed at popular Twitter personalities who were able to profit off early knowledge of the mint.  The project’s sales have since cooled off from its weekend highs, but the return of buzzy mints and their Twitter pandemonium are a welcome sign for many in NFT land given recent market conditions, with The Saudis being the first popular project to launch since the price of ETH crashed as much as 50% in early June.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/11/a-saudi-arabia-themed-nft-collection-is-the-latest-free-to-mint-hit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90d7323c9d952360cd1ad2dcc68e908961004db8-1802x1384.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The maneuver freed up $172 million of collateral that had been locked in the platforms as collateral. Celsius used a similar treasury-management tactic last week on the Maker platform to free up $480 million in collateral.  Data on Nansen Portfolio tracker shows that a wallet linked to Celsius transferred $35 million in DAI – MakerDAO's dollar-pegged stablecoin – and $40 million in Circle's USDC stablecoin in various transactions. The wallet also paid down another $20 million in USDC late Sunday to the Aave protocol, according to data on the blockchain transaction tracer Etherscan.  Celsius also exchanged some interest-bearing token derivatives on Aave for 1,647 WBTC ($33.4 million worth) and about $1.6 million combined of BAT and xSUSHI, a derivative of decentralized exchange SushiSwap's native token that pays interest on the exchange's staking platform.  The down payments let Celsius redeem a part of the collateral of the debt. Since Friday, the firm reclaimed 8,436 wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), which is worth $172 million at current prices. It also redeemed about $700,000 in COMP, the Compound protocol's native token.  The recent credit crisis in the crypto markets hit centralized crypto lenders hard, with Voyager Digital filing for bankruptcy protection and BlockFi seeking a credit lifeline and bailout from crypto exchange FTX. Celsius halted all customer withdrawals starting June 12 to avoid a run on its deposits, while cutting jobs and hiring restructuring experts.  Celsius, however, now appears on its way to pay off the rest of its debt to DeFi protocols to reclaim the digital assets pledged against the loans as collateral.  After the moves, the firm still owed $140 million to Aave and Compound, reduced from $235 million as of last Friday, according to DeFi data platform Zapper's dashboard.  The collateral that Celsius locked up against those loans stood at $680 million, shrinking from $950 million, and should be freed up theoretically if Celsius fully pays off rest of the debt.",NEUTRAL,COMP,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | COMP | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/11/celsius-reclaims-172m-collateral-from-aave-compound,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6da709b6d97594577bdce5f7e3ca46c567986e6f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421483,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUm5,1657558440,NFTs Are Now Collateral for Secured Loans. Are You Legally Protected?,"Regardless of personal views, it has grown near impossible not to take notice of non-fungible tokens (NFT). Even with recent slowdowns, total NFT sales volume could top $90 billion by the end of this year (after seeing a record $40 billion in 2021). That success has brought a new type of interest from a new group of participants in the NFT ecosystem – lenders.  And with a new participant in the NFT space comes a new label for NFTs – collateral.  Whether it is an NFT-secured loan, a used car loan or a multimillion-dollar leveraged finance of an entire company, the motivations of lenders and borrowers are consistent. The lender is incentivized to give temporary funds to the borrower in exchange for an interest rate charged on top of the principal loan amount. The borrower is willing to pay the interest rate because they need an immediate source of liquid funds without selling the asset.  What does change in each asset class is how the lender is protected from a borrower’s non-payment of the loan, or “default.” In a used-car marketplace, the lender receives ownership of the car if the borrower defaults. A deep foundation of secured lending regulations (primarily Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, or UCC) gives lenders the necessary confidence that this car ownership transfer will occur with or without the defaulting borrower’s cooperation.  So what secured lending regulations apply to NFTs?  Jeff Karas is an attorney at the law firm of Anderson Kill. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  While simple in theory, and even in smart contract execution (if borrower does not pay, then the NFT transfers from borrower wallet to lender wallet), the legal protections of using an NFT as collateral is a complicated question of “perfection” of the lender’s security interest. An NFT is not a car, and under the current UCC regulations an NFT is not even “art.” It is most likely either a “general intangible,” which is effectively the UCC’s overflow bucket most commonly used for difficult to categorize collateral, or it is an “investment property,” which is a term encompassing securities and other security-like financial assets.  If an NFT is a general intangible, then the lender’s simplest path to perfection is via the filing of a UCC-1 Financing Statement in the state where the NFT owner is deemed to be located. Knowing a car owner’s legal name and location may be simple, but in the digitally native and often intentionally anonymous world of NFTs, a lender may find it difficult to know the precise filing jurisdiction to perfect their interest in a Bored Ape owned by “MoonBoiBallz99.” This hurdle makes perfection by filing of a UCC-1 an impractical solution at best, and a fool’s errand at worst.  Perfection of an NFT labeled as investment property may be more appropriate for crypto focused lenders and borrowers. A security interest in an investment property is perfected by “control.” A lender can obtain control under the UCC if (1) the NFT is deposited directly into the lender’s wallet, which may be uncomfortable for the borrower, or (2) the NFT is transferred to a third party and an agreement is signed by the lender, the borrower and the third party. Under this tripartite agreement, the borrower grants a lender the security interest in the NFT, but the NFT is held in a specific account (or wallet) with the third party. That third party, in turn, agrees to only follow the directions of the lender, thereby giving the lender “control” of the NFT, perfecting their security interest.  Three-party agreements of this flavor, often called an “account control agreement,” are common in traditional lending ecosystems where the third party is a bank or bank-like entity. However, banks are more often labeled as the “enemy” than anyone’s trusted middleman in the cryptocurrency and NFT space, so any legitimization of NFT lending will require new projects to fill this void.  Several teams have already dipped their toes into the NFT lending waters with assorted models of execution and widely varying levels of real and perceived legal protections at their core. The most used example to date is the South African project NFTfi, which has facilitated nearly 13,000 loans and a total cumulative loan volume of over $212 million since its inception (according to statistics available from Dune Analytics). NFTfi’s agreements between the borrower and lender are based entirely on smart contracts “signed” by each party, but it is unclear at an initial glance how tight those contracts are from a legal protection perspective. No plain language agreements are presented to any lender or borrower on the NFTfi system, but it is reported that over 20% of all loans are defaulted on and there have been no publicized failures in the transfer of the collateralized NFT upon any borrower’s default.  Other NFT lending platforms have started to pop up in recent months (including Arcade, which completed a $15 million Series A funding round in December led by Pantera Capital). More are on the way. Some are primarily on-chain services like NFTfi, while others, like Nexo.io, are promising a more nuanced, over-the-counter approach (including a formal application process for each borrower). Whatever the method, it is unclear how much any of these new platforms will focus on the legal enforceability of their lending agreements.  It is possible that, as in many marketplaces, there will not be a call for any strenuous legal protections until there is an issue worth disputing or an issue big enough to make headlines. When that time comes, crypto and secured lending attorneys should be ready to pick up their old copy of the UCC and understand the unique crossroads blockchain has brought to the space (again).",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Jeff D.

Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, the cryptocurrency industry has matured far beyond its original concept as a medium of exchange, spawning countless new use cases. Decentralized finance, as these new use cases have collectively become known, refers to a range of financial services that can be accessed by anyone without the involvement of a centralized institution or intermediary, such as a bank, broker, or loan shark. DeFi, as it&apos;s known, provides banking for the unbanked, or banking without a bank. Its scope goes far beyond simply saving money and sending payments. These days, DeFi refers to a world of cryptocurrency exchanges, automated payments, capital transfers, spot and futures trading, lending, borrowing, high yield staking, liquidity provisioning and much more. The truly remarkable feature of DeFi though is not the extent of its functionality, which these days has matched - and some say even surpassed - that of traditional finance. Its most important quality is that it can be accessed by anyone at all, without any need for a bank account or identification.

42394524,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAVVP,1657554979,Signs Bitcoin May Have Bottomed: Here’s What Experts Told Us,"Bitcoin (BTC) topped out at nearly $69,000 in November 2021, setting off the last display of fireworks for the 2020-2021 bull market. Since then, bitcoin’s price has trended downward, with no bottom in sight. But surely there’s a bottom somewhere during this bear market, leading many to ask: Is there a way to tell what the bottom price is?  Many traders and investors are lured by the quest of timing the bottom. Since it marks the lowest price in a given cycle, any price action that follows the bottom is a net positive. But trying to time the bottom may be a fool’s errand. As pseudonymous crypto trader and educator Cred tells CoinDesk, “The bottom is usually only obvious in hindsight. Just like the top.”  CoinDesk asked seasoned traders and investors for signs of the bitcoin bottom, whether the bottom matters and what alternatives retail investors and traders can look out for.  See Also: How to Avoid Crypto Bear Market Mistakes and Be Ready for the Next Bull Run  Macro conditions  Bitcoin’s price correlation to U.S. equities is at an all-time high. The world’s largest cryptocurrency trades pretty much like a Nasdaq-listed big tech stock, and so analyzing bitcoin’s price action needs to take into account macro conditions underpinning the real-world economy.  “A major bitcoin bottom signal for me is when we see data showing us that inflation is convincingly inflecting down,” Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, told CoinDesk. “I would be cautious until inflation starts to come down, as we have learnt that the Federal Reserve is king when it comes to risk assets like crypto, and the pain of quantitative tightening could drag on for many more months.”  Considering that much of bitcoin’s price action is tightly related to macro conditions, it’s more sensible to watch out for a macro bottom.  But timing the macro bottom is no easy feat, either.  “I do not think we can be convinced of a macro bottom until the Federal Reserve slows down their rate hikes,” Sotiriou said. If the Federal Reserve makes a U-turn on its stance, however, the market will gain confidence. “The point at which we see this happen may be when bitcoin has made a significant move off of the lows,” he said.  Accumulation phase  There are some common features across bitcoin price bottoms.  “The 2015 price bottom came after being held within a tight price range for a year, and the 2019 bottom came after a three-month period of low volatility,” Josh Olszewicz, head of research at crypto fund manager Valkyrie Investments, told CoinDesk.  “Bottoms typically take time to form because the volume of buyers and sellers eventually comes to an equilibrium until demand overtakes supply,” he said. In technical terms, those extended periods are referred to as “accumulation.”  Cryptocurrency markets are often volatile with extreme price moves. But sometimes they become dull and trade sideways: You wake up, check the price, and it’s only a 0.1% change. Olszewicz said that bitcoin price bottoms have historically followed “extended periods of low volatility and unexciting price movements.”  Signs of accumulation include “multiple touches of the 200-week moving average, as well as holding below the realized bitcoin price, or aggregate average price of all coins moved on-chain,” Olszewicz explained. “Rather than perfectly trying to time the bottom, savvy investors often look to previous bear markets for these technical signs and begin to dollar cost average when similar conditions are met.”  See Also: Bitcoin in 'Accumulation' Phase, On-chain Indicators Suggest  A period of undervaluation  Instead of envisioning the bottom as a single price point, perhaps it’s more helpful to think in terms of price ranges.  “Many traders try to time exact bottoms or exact tops, and often fail at doing so,” pseudonymous trader ChimpZoo told CoinDesk. “Rather, they should look for periods of overvaluation and undervaluation and trade accordingly.”  Periods of undervaluation are historically marked by large sell-offs of bitcoin, such as the crash at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic or in November 2018. “Whether you bought at $3,200 or $3,800 in 2018, or whether you bought at $5,200 or $6,200 in 2020 ultimately made no difference,” he said.  During the mid-2022 crash, overleveraged crypto trading firms or lenders had to capitulate, indicating “a potential level of key undervaluation,” he said, adding that “when we pump out of this range in the next week, or in three months is hard to judge, but ultimately these cheap prices will be viewed as a gift in due time.”  The bottom isn’t the same as a new uptrend  The bottom isn’t a trampoline. Once the market hits the bottom, it doesn’t immediately jump from it. It may take a while for a new uptrend to begin.  “Even if price bottoms, the market can continue to suck if it’s followed by a period of low volatility, illiquidity and so on,” Cred said. He describes the bottom as where “the pain stops” and the new uptrend as “where the serious wealth is made.” And there can be a long time gap between the two.  Look for an uptrend instead of a bottom  “Looking for the beginning of a longer-term rally is more important than seeking the bottom,” VKTR, a pseudonymous trader and core contributor at decentralized exchange IDEX, told CoinDesk.  “Sure, you may be a little late, but you won’t be sweating because you bought a dip that then dipped another 50% or that price has been at your entry for five months.”  Palate cleanser, anyone?  The mid-2022 crash has been marked by a series of unsavory events, such as the gigantic collapse of algorithmic stablecoin UST and failure of several high-profile crypto companies.  For the bottom to form, time needs to heal the anxious market sentiment.  “The bottom is as much a product of time as it is price, in most cases,” Cred said. “Bad memories need to fade from the public consciousness, reputation risk must subside, enthusiasm from survivors, builders and other incumbents must return, and cynicism must abate to make way for optimism.”  And that might take a while.

The cryptocurrency lost last week&apos;s gains and seems poised for further losses as the crypto market trends sideways. Related Reading | TA: Bitcoin Price Trims Gains, Key Breakdown Support Nearby At the time of writing, Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.44 with a 5% loss in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is at critical levels as $0.40 was operated as support during these past months&apos; bearish downside price action. Losing these levels could push ADA&apos;s price back to its 2020 levels. At that time, the cryptocurrency experienced a massive rally after a long period of sideways movement and consolidation. From 2019 until 2020, Cardano traded below $0.5 and $0.15 which would represent a devasting loss for investors that bought ADA in the past two years. Legendary trader Peter Brandt suggests ADA could start descending into its 2020 levels. As seen below, Brandt claims that ADA&apos;s price is following a head and shoulders pattern which spells future depreciation for this cryptocurrency. The legendary trader called ADA&apos;s price chart &apos;the very definition of ugly&apos; and set $0.40 as a potential price target to the downside. This head and shoulders pattern could be invalidated if Cardano&apos;s bulls managed to push the price above $0.70 in the short term. Otherwise, there is little support for Cardano below $0.40.

42394520,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAVL9,1657551565,What Is the Ethereum Name Service? How ENS Works and What It’s Used For,"During the early days of the internet, one of the central problems computer scientists faced was that domain names and internet protocol addresses had not been matched up, making them unfriendly to an average user.  What that meant is if you wanted to access a website, you would need to type out the full IP address of the site you wanted to visit, such as 54.235.191.121. Since IP addresses are just strings of numbers and dots that are long and difficult to remember, It made it hard to browse the web.  However, following the cutting-edge research done by Elizabeth Feinler, an American scientist, in the 1970s, Paul Mockapetris, an American computer scientist, developed the Domain Name System (DNS) in 1983.  The DNS matches IP addresses with human-friendly domain names. For instance, as opposed to typing out 54.235.191.121, you can simply type coindesk.com into your search bar and be directed to the website.  Read more: What Is Ethereum?  Despite all the technological wizardry occurring in the crypto sector, cryptocurrencies still mostly use a system similar to the old IP address setup.  If you want to send your bitcoin to someone else’s address, you will have to use that person's wallet address as opposed to using something human-friendly like the wallet owner’s name.  That’s where the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) comes in.  What is the Ethereum Name Service?  The Ethereum Name Service is a distributed, open and expandable naming system that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain.  Similar to the role of the DNS mentioned above, the role of the ENS is to map human-readable names such as ""john.eth"" to a machine-readable name such as a wallet address like ""8g978dl39ji9xl.""  Through the ENS, users can buy and manage their own domains, meaning that secure and decentralized transactions can take place without having to deal with long and complex addresses. It also reduces the likelihood of any input errors when typing out the recipient’s address to send funds.  Now, the ENS may sound identical to the DNS system developed in the 1980s, but its architecture differs greatly.  Like the DNS, the ENS uses a system of hierarchical names called domains, with the creator and owner of the domain having control over his top-level domain and subsequent subdomains.  How the ENS works     Registry  First, all the domain names that are recorded inside the ENS have an owner. An owner owns a named domain and can transfer that name to a new owner at his own discretion.  The owner who wishes to buy a domain is called a ""registrant"" because he must register that domain on the ENS. Recording, monitoring and tracking of who has made registration for a domain – the registrar – is undertaken by a functionality of the ENS called the “registry.”  ""Registrars"" are smart contracts that allocate the subdomain names and are governed by the main registrar called the permanent registrar. They can be altered at any point or at any level within the ENS and can be referred to by the owner of the registry.  A registrant of a registration can also transfer his registration of a domain to another given account. Additionally, in case the individual wishes to recover a given domain name, he can do so by reclaiming that name and domain.  This resets the ownership of the ENS name to the registrar who has reclaimed a given account.  Names  As mentioned above, there is a difference between owning a name and owning a registration. A ""name"" acts as a way for the ENS to identify a given domain such as ""john.eth"" and can consist of different labels that are separated by dots.  The algorithm that is used to process domain names registered on the ENS is called the ""namehash."" The namehash comes into play because human-friendly names are replaced on the ENS system, which functions only with a finite length of 256-bit cryptographic hashes.  If one wishes to derive the hash from the name and still preserve the domain's hierarchical properties, a namehash is used. For instance, for ""john.eth,"" the namehash is 0x787192fc5378cc32aa.  Representing names in this manner is exclusive to the ENS.  Now, before the namehash comes into play, names must first be normalized, meaning upper- and lower-case names are treated equally. This is important because the namehash process ensures that all users get the same view of the names and domains available on the ENS.  Why is ENS important?  Because the ENS was developed for Ethereum smart contracts – and is native to the Ethereum ecosystem – it doesn't suffer from security issues faced by a DNS system. DNS records of domains and names are stored on a centralized server. That means they are prone to hacks.  For instance, in October 2020, Google's threat analysis group monitored a record-breaking 180,000 attacks on DNSs as well as on other network targets that were launched from Chinese internet service providers.  Conversely, ENS records cannot be destroyed and are secured by the Ethereum blockchain.  Additionally, through the ENS, names and addresses become more transparent and easier to interact with. Anyone can create or register an "".eth"" domain by participating in an auction process. The highest bid will win the domain name, allowing the winner to create subdomains as well as lease the domains.  That gives users on the Ethereum blockchain a unique opportunity to set up shop on the Ethereum network and become a clear point of contact within a sea of addresses.

In 2018, the United States reimposed sanctions that had been suspended three years earlier as part of Iran&apos;s nuclear deal with major world powers. That same year, Binance informed traders in Iran it would no longer serve them, telling them to liquidate their accounts. However, a Reuters investigation found that the traders in Iran were still able to use their Binance accounts until as recently as September last year, only losing access after the exchange tightened its anti-money laundering checks a month earlier. Until that point, customers could trade by registering with just an email address. &apos;There were some alternatives, but none of them were as good as Binance.

42422781,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0pb7h,1657547593,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Struggles to Hold $20.5K and Twitter Shares Dip 6%,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: Bitcoin and Twitter shares are trading down Monday morning. More news unfolds from Three Arrow Capital's court documents, and traders think BTC could push back further in the short term.  Market Moves: Omkar Godbole reports that an on-chain indicator is suggesting bitcoin could be undervalued. Similar readings have marked bear market bottoms in the past.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) has been down 3.6% over the past 24 hours after trading $20,000 to $21,000 over the weekend.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization began to show signs of resilience last week as it briefly traded above $22,000, registering its highest valuation since mid-June.  Bitcoin liquidations are showing longs to be substantially higher than shorts over the past 24 hours, data from Coinglass shows.  Shorts totaled $5.79 million and longs totaled $40.62 million.  “This could trigger sell orders at any time of the day,” said Laurent Kssis, head of Europe at Hashdex.  “We could test $20,000 before pushing back,” added Kssis.  Ether (ETH) is down 3% on the day, at $1,142. The only altcoins trading in the green Monday morning were privacy token monero (XMR) and tezos (XTC), up 5% and 3%, respectively.  Meanwhile,Twitter (TWTR) shares slipped in pre-market trading after Elon Musk decided to scrap his planned $44 billion takeover of the social media platform – causing fears that legal action could ensue.  TWTR shares on the New York Stock Exchange were trading down 6.55% at $34.40 at the time of writing.  Following the Three Arrows Capital debacle, the hedge fund recently got an emergency hearing as founders were failing to ""cooperate.""  In court documents filed late Friday in New York, lawyers acting on behalf of the creditors said that the founders of the fund “have not yet begun to cooperate with the [proceeding] in any meaningful manner.”  Creditors said that the fund’s remaining assets could be “transferred or otherwise disposed of” before creditors get their share. But first, creditors are requesting the court to obligate Three Arrows’s founders to list out the fund’s assets.  Terra developers migrate to Polygon  In other news, more than 48 projects previously on the Terra network have begun migrating to Polygon almost two months after the Terra ecosystem collapsed following the implosion of terraUSD (UST).  More than $20 million had been earmarked to help projects making the move.  Elsewhere, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that monitors financial systems and proposes rules with the goal of preventing financial crises, plans to present recommendations for regulating crypto in October, according to a Monday statement.  The FSB said it will propose recommendations for stablecoin regulation and submit a report on recommended rules for other crypto assets to the G-20.

That's the message from indicators tracking tokens sold by miners and comparing the cryptocurrency's market value to its fair value.  The Puell Multiple, calculated by dividing the daily issuance of bitcoins in U.S. dollar terms by the 365-day average of the value, has dropped into a ""green zone"" below 0.5, indicating the newly minted coins are undervalued relative to the yearly average.  In other words, the current profitability of those responsible for minting coins is relatively low. In the past, that's indicated a perfect opportunity to build long-term exposure to the cryptocurrency.  ""Entering the green zone is a good time to average in, and for those more conservative, you can also wait for confirmation with a move out of the accumulation zone,"" analysts at Blockware Intelligence said in a newsletter published on Sunday.  The daily issuance refers to coins added to the ecosystem by miners, who receive them as rewards for verifying a new block of bitcoin transactions. Recently, many miners have reduced their crypto holdings to stay afloat as the value of the reward has fallen.  Undervalued readings on the Puell Multiple have marked previous bear market bottoms.  ""The Puell Multiple has reached a territory consistent with market bottoms in the past (below 0.5 and even touching levels below 0.4 a few weeks ago),"" said Julio Moreno, a senior analyst at South Korea-based blockchain data from CryptoQuant.

Binance operated outside the rules that many rival firms follow, while being ambiguous over the jurisdiction in which the main business is located, the news organization said.  Reuters also said Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao ignored advice from his compliance team on the lack of background checks to avoid facilitating money laundering through the exchange.  ""We have a robust compliance program that incorporates anti-money laundering and global sanctions principles and tools used by financial institutions to detect and address suspicious activity,"" a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""As a result of our strong compliance/KYC program, we were able to secure approvals and registration from France and Italy, making us the only crypto company to do so from G-7 countries.""  Last month, Reuters reported that Binance became a ""hub"" for hackers, fraudsters and drug traffickers, claims that were rejected by Binance compliance officer Matthew Price, who said the report used skewed metrics to ""get an agenda across.""  In a bid to curb money laundering on the platform in 2021, Binance slashed its daily withdrawal limit for accounts that had not passed know-your-customer (KYC) protocols to 0.06 bitcoin (BTC) from 2 BTC.  It recently ramped up its hiring of regulatory experts, recruiting Seth Levy, who spent 16 years at U.S. regulator Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA, and Steven McWhirter from the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority in April.  In a statement to Reuters, a Binance spokesperson said that “we are both leading and investing in the future technologies and legislation that will set the crypto industry on the road to becoming a well-regulated, secure industry.”  In a separate story, Reuters said Binance continued to serve customers in Iran until September 2021. While the exchange announced a ban on Iranian citizens in November 2018 after the U.S. reimposed sanctions, Reuters found seven traders who said they'd been able to use Binance until the KYC checks were tightened last year.

Of course, not as interesting as in the period from January to May 2021. However, in June 2022, trading volumes finally increased several times. Even during the weekly candle of 9 May, when sellers tried to break the $0.58 mark, trading volumes were lower than during the first month of summer. The stop of the uncorrected fall from January 2022 is already a good sign and it is time to determine the critical points above which the falling trend will be broken. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/cWxbn9O5/ The weekly chart shows that sellers have spent a lot of effort to take control of the $0.58 mark. However, these efforts did not yield the desired result. After breaking the $0.58 mark, the MATIC price did not continue its aggressive decline. Instead, buyers began placing limit orders, which caused the MATIC price to slow down. The $0.38 range stopped the decline and allowed buyers to form a rebound. For three weeks now, buyers have had a local initiative on the market. Though, an unsuccessful attempt to take control of the $0.58 mark may turn into a new fall wave even from the local low update. For the MATIC price to continue to rebound upwards, buyers should keep the local mark of $0.5. It was this mark that stopped the strong impulse of the fall from 9 May, and in the case of buyers&apos; strength, it is quite suitable for the role of local support.

Each jurisdiction will have its own legal framework, but many design features for CBDCs – which are digital versions of existing sovereign currencies like the U.S. dollar – are still undecided, allowing central banks to start with a “clean slate,” according to a just-released BIS joint report with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.  The conclusions are in line with those of Cecilia Skingsley, who is first deputy governor of Sweden's central bank and set to become head of the innovation arm at BIS, which is based in Basel, Switzerland. Two weeks ago, she warned of the potential for countries to not “play nicely” with one another with respect to CBDC design.  “To promote coexistence with other forms of money and payment instruments and a reasonable level of adoption of CBDC, interoperability with non-CBDC systems, both domestically and cross-border, is fundamental,” the report says.  That countries around the globe are looking into establishing a CBDC at least in part in response to the crypto market boom is no secret. The Bahamas was the first to launch a digital currency, named the “sand dollar,” in 2020, and China has pushed forward with its trial of the digital yuan. Nigeria launched its own CBDC, the eNaira, in October.  When constructing a CBDC, central banks would have to decide on some key issues – such as who gets to use CBDCs and whether private payments companies will be able to access their CBDC infrastructure. According to the BIS report, central banks could either agree to a set of common standards or use different ""interlinking"" systems that still allow people to transact with one another or just have a single access point between systems.  Each of the CBDC access models has different implications around risks, efficiency, resilience and interoperability, the report continues, noting there is no “one size fits all” solution. For example, while compatibility might be the least costly form of interoperability, it may not achieve efficiency benefits similar to interlinking multiple systems or developing a single system, the report says.  Overall, interlinking CBDC systems through a hub and spoke – where a common hub connects two or more separate CBDC systems or a single system model that uses similar infrastructure and a common rule book – might bring more improvement to the cross-border payments market than the other options, according to the report.  The BIS sets out five criteria for central banks to consider when moving along with their CBDC options. Central banks must do no harm, enhance efficiency, increase resilience, assure coexistence and interoperability with other systems, and bolster financial inclusion, the report says.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/11/bis-calls-for-global-collaboration-with-cbdc-designs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43c44aed45431c9fe48593b2cfc1b12e84d9fea5-6404x4803.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Attorney John Deaton of the Deaton Law Firm submitted a motion letter to the judge in late May asking permission to submit a brief on behalf of thousands of XRP holders.

The case, which was filed in December 2020, revolves around the Commission&apos;s claim that Ripple refused to register approximately $1.4 billion worth of XRP, its native coin, as securities.

42422776,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0paxh,1657541619,CoinFLEX Begins Arbitration to Recover $84M in Delinquent Debt,"Crypto trading platform CoinFLEX has begun arbitration for the recovery of over $84 million in debt owed by a “large individual customer” as part of a broader revival strategy.  “We have commenced arbitration in HKIAC (Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre) for the recovery of this $84 million as the individual had a legal obligation under the agreement to pay and has refused to do so,” CoinFLEX said in a post on Saturday. “His liability to pay is a personal liability, which means the individual is personally liable to pay the total amount, so our lawyers are very confident that we can enforce the award against him.”  CoinFLEX suspended withdrawals last month after a certain individual’s account went into negative equity during June’s market volatility, affecting its balances. The individual was revealed by CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb to be prominent crypto investor Roger Ver, a claim that Ver denied on social media.  In Saturday’s post, CoinFLEX said it holds more than 26 million FLEX tokens – valued at over $7 million at current rates – in its inventory. It added that resuming trades would cause market volatility in FLEX's price, which would inadvertently affect the collateral positions of platform users.  The company also said that it is looking to raise a significant amount of funds from investors, including by using customer deposits in exchange for equity.  “There are a number of investors in this group of large depositors who have indicated that they may be in a position to help the business move forward if we can all find a workable solution,” the firm said.  Recovering the delinquent debt, however, could help buffer FLEX prices and prevent a steep drop, CoinFLEX said. “We believe the recovery of the debt will help build confidence in and will help shore up the trading price of FLEX Coin,” it said.  FLEX fell from $4.20 to $1.60 in late June as CoinFLEX went public with its losses, CoinGecko data shows. The lack of a swift recovery plan has added to the losses, with the tokens now down 94% in the past 30 days.  Meanwhile, CoinFLEX said that it hopes to make 10% of customers’ balances available for withdrawal in the next week, adding that the arbitration process could “take up to 12 months.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/11/coinflex-begins-arbitration-against-84m-delinquent-customer-flex-holders-in-focus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef24645873c8bf5d6b5a8874a18019dc3bf42fb9-4427x3321.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Polkadot prices are facing resistance at $8.02 The closest support is at $0.53. Past Performance of DOT DOT technical analysis shows that the coin is currently in a bearish trend. The coin has been facing stiff resistance at $8.02. However, it has found some support at $6.72. The coin has been struggling to maintain its bullish momentum and has started to correct lower. The immediate support for the coin lies at $6.72 and any further dip might push the prices towards $5.60. Looking at the 4-hour chart, the Polkadot price is trading well below the $8.02 resistance and the 100 simple moving average (SMA). The prices have recently bounced off the $6.72 support area and are currently consolidating in a narrow range. Source- Tradingview DOT Technical Analysis The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator on the 4-hour chart is currently near the 50 level, which indicates that the market is neutral. The MACD is also trading in the bearish zone below the signal line. Therefore, DOT prices are likely to remain under pressure in the short term and can correct lower towards $5.60 in the coming sessions. On the other hand, if the DOT prices sustain above $8.02, a move towards $9.20 and $10 is possible in the near term.

However, things have progressed to the point where such apps now include a wide range of integrations. Online communication has gone beyond the mere purpose of messaging to include sharing media, contacts, and documents. The most recent trend is the integration of online payments. For example, Messaging applications incorporate payment systems, allowing users to transfer money with only a few clicks. Thus, although fiat payments dominate the present scene, a new age of crypto payments is emerging steadily. The benefits of speed, low transaction costs, decentralization, and borderless transactions make crypto an ideal instrument for messaging apps. As a result, big companies like Apple and Meta are considering introducing cryptocurrency payments into their apps. And two of the most popular messaging apps, Signal and Telegram, have already integrated cryptocurrency payments. However, the bulk of innovation is happening at the emerging projects that aim to power the future of in-chat micropayments. TokLok, for example, is a decentralized, crypto-native messaging platform offering a convenient and secure online communication service.

42422782,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0pb9h,1657535970,Global Financial Watchdog FSB to Propose Crypto Regulations in October,"The Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that monitors financial systems and proposes rules with the goal of preventing financial crises, plans to present recommendations for regulating crypto in October, according to a statement on Monday.  The Basel, Switzerland-based organization reports to the Group of 20 of the world's largest economies. The recommendations will cover stablecoins and other crypto assets, the board said.  ""The FSB is working to ensure that crypto assets are subject to robust regulation and supervision,"" the statement said, adding the recent ""turmoil"" in crypto markets highlights the intrinsic volatility and structural vulnerabilities as well as the increasing interconnectedness between crypto markets and the traditional financial system.  The crypto market downturn and collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin is accelerating regulatory action. In June, European Union policymakers agreed on a landmark bill to govern crypto issuers and service providers, with a heavy emphasis on rules for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of other assets like sovereign currencies.  In February, the FSB published a report warning the unregulated crypto sector could derail global financial stability, not least because of its rapid growth. FSB Chairman Klaas Knot said in May that the watchdog is ""well placed"" to take the lead in setting up a ""coherent global regulatory framework for crypto assets.""  The FSB plans to submit a report to the G-20 in October on ""high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of stablecoins."" The proposed rules may include ways to extend existing frameworks to ""close gaps"" and implement recommended regulations.  The FSB also plans to submit a report with recommendations for ""promoting international consistency of regulatory and supervisory approaches to other crypto assets.""",NEUTRAL,없음,LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/11/global-financial-watchdog-fsb-to-propose-crypto-regulations-in-october,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a757c8a24071a1e6050a1fe153f283d08a22235-5355x4016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Trading volumes increased after establishing a local low of $25.86, and buyers managed to stop the price from falling. The SOL cryptocurrency stopped in the consolidation range of $30.8-$40.6, in which market participants measure their strength. Usually, increased trading volumes within the range of consolidation indicate a market reversal. Especially if there was a strong uncorrected trend before the consolidation. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/SI6umPEJ/ Therefore, keeping the mark of $30.8 by buyers in the near term will mean continued growth with a minimum target of $51.8. This target was the reason for the SOL correction in May 2021 and stopped buyers in a confident trend. However, when buying SOL in the range of $30.8, you should not neglect the stop order. The fact is that after breaking this mark, the next target of $22 will be opened for sellers. This mark is the key level on the weekly timeframe. From May to July 2021, buyers confidently held the $22 mark, which was the reason for the continued growth to $259. Thus, even breaking through the current downward consolidation will not cause a total collapse in the SOL market. The worst is over.

It was ready to pay as much as $20 million to help Terra teams migrate to Polygon's own blockchain to continue building products.  “For any project which wants to come from Terra to Polygon, we will be happy to provide them both financial assistance as well as technical assistance,” a spokesperson for Polygon told CoinDesk at the time. “We’ll provide them developers and everything.”  Developers behind other blockchain networks also courted Terra projects, among them Kadena, Cosmos and Avalanche, as previously reported.  UST, the Terra network’s algorithmic stablecoin that was designed to maintain its value by minting or burning exactly $1 worth of luna for 1 UST, fell to under 10 cents in May after losing its peg following investor outflows.

42395271,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXpU9,1657531415,"Bitcoin in 'Accumulation' Phase, On-chain Indicators Suggest","It's time to start stacking bitcoin again. That's the message from indicators tracking tokens sold by miners and comparing the cryptocurrency's market value to its fair value.  The Puell Multiple, calculated by dividing the daily issuance of bitcoins in U.S. dollar terms by the 365-day average of the value, has dropped into a ""green zone"" below 0.5, indicating the newly minted coins are undervalued relative to the yearly average.  In other words, the current profitability of those responsible for minting coins is relatively low. In the past, that's indicated a perfect opportunity to build long-term exposure to the cryptocurrency.  ""Entering the green zone is a good time to average in, and for those more conservative, you can also wait for confirmation with a move out of the accumulation zone,"" analysts at Blockware Intelligence said in a newsletter published on Sunday.  The daily issuance refers to coins added to the network by miners, who receive them as rewards for verifying a new block of bitcoin transactions. Recently, many miners have reduced their crypto holdings to stay afloat as the value of the reward has fallen.  Undervalued readings on the Puell Multiple have marked previous bear market bottoms.  ""The Puell Multiple has reached a territory consistent with market bottoms in the past (below 0.5 and even touching levels below 0.4 a few weeks ago),"" said Julio Moreno, a senior analyst at South Korea-based blockchain data firm CryptoQuant.  Previous sub-0.5 readings observed between March 2020 and May 2020, November 2018 and January 2019, November 2014 and April 2015 and during the final quarter of 2011 coincided with peak selling and bear market bottoms. While China's mining ban in June 2021 perhaps distorted the indicator, it still coincided with a market bottom.  Essentially, the metric entered the green zone in the last leg of the bear market, following which the downward momentum weakened, allowing for weeks of price consolidation and a subsequent revival.  One question is whether signals from miner flows are reliable, given the sales now constitute a only small portion of overall flows.  ""If all newly issued bitcoin were immediately sold on the market each day, it would equate to only 900 BTC of selling pressure, which represents just 1%-1.5% of total daily volume,"" crypto exchange Coinbase said in a recent research report.  Analysts, however, retain confidence in the multiple's predictive powers. ""Mining is still the backbone of the network, whether the portion [of miner flows] is small or not. This is why the metric gets higher importance in our opinion, irrespective of narratives. The metric is not invalidated yet,"" cryptocurrency intelligence firm Jarvis Labs told CoinDesk.  CryptoQuant's Moreno said, ""Miner flows continue to represent an important volume of bitcoin flowing to exchanges, and the Puell Multiple is calculated using the USD value of new bitcoin issued, which is higher on average than it was in 2018 or 2014-15.""  Indicators including the market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score and long-term moving average crossovers also indicate the time is ripe for accumulation.  The MVRV Z-score, which measures the deviation of market value from realized value and is another indication of undervaluation, turned negative in mid-June.  Bitcoin's market value or capitalization refers to the total dollar value of the supply in circulation, as calculated by the daily average price across major exchanges. The realized value approximates the value paid for all coins in existence by summing the market value of coins at the time they last moved on the blockchain.  The realized value adjusts for lost coins and is closer to the fair value of the cryptocurrency. Therefore, the Z-score representing the deviation of market value from the realized or fair value is tracked to gauge whether the cryptocurrency is undervalued or overvalued.  Historically, an MVRV Z-score below zero has marked bear market lows, while a reading above seven has marked major bull market tops.  Bitcoin was recently trading near $20,400, down 1% on the day. The cryptocurrency has dropped 55% this year, according to CoinDesk data.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/11/bitcoin-in-accumulation-phase-onchain-indicators-suggest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b80e87eb1973ab07b7fa1e9ad84927eeb416bb6e-1762x1322.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In documents filed late Friday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, lawyers acting on behalf of the creditors said the founders of the fund “have not yet begun to cooperate with the [proceeding] in any meaningful manner.”  The lawyers said that persons identifying themselves as “Su Zhu” and “Kyle” were present on an initial Zoom call, but their video and audio was turned off and they would not respond to questions posed directly to them, with only their legal representatives answering questions.  Lawyers for the creditors that visited Three Arrows’s Singapore office found it abandoned, according to court documents.  Concerns are mounting that assets belonging to Three Arrows, which are largely in the form of cash, crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFT) could be easily transferred.  Already, NFTs belonging to Three Arrows’s NFT fund Starry Night have been transferred to a new wallet for unexplained reasons.  The creditors are seeking to freeze Three Arrows’s assets. But first they are requesting the court to compel Three Arrows’s founders to list out the fund’s assets.

This is due to the benefits they had enjoyed or read that crypto offers. Some of the strategies to bypass the crypto ban include the following. 1. Use of Virtual Private Network (VPN) Virtual Private Network (VPN) is used for anonymous online browsing. This is attained by routing the encrypted activities of the users. Other users will not be able to know or have access to the users&apos; information. VPN allows its users to pick the country of their choice while browsing. Since some VPNs are free to use, a crypto user can easily access their exchange account or private wallets with them. Through this, the government will not be able to receive information concerning them. Using VPNs is one of the most effective strategies to bypass crypto ban. 2. Peer-to-Peer Transactions Most top Cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Mexc, Kucoin, LBank, Crypto.com, Gate.io, and others have established peer-to-peer transactions. This is known in the crypto space as P2P trades. P2P allows users in a given country to trade on their cryptocurrency assets and the local fiat.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin (BTC) slides for a third day, once again threatening to fall below the crucial $20K mark.

Some analysts are now pinning $17,000 as a key market support level.  ""We continue to expect choppy price action,"" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, in an email. ""More strong bidding around the $17K level, if bitcoin falls there again, will be a strong signal for the bulls and may indicate the formation of a potential bottom around that price.""  Traders this week will be watching for the latest U.S. consumer price index reading, expected Wednesday. The report could influence market expectations over the Federal Reserve's next move, at a meeting later this month; as of the last reading, inflation was at its fastest in four decades.  One point of consideration: This past Friday's report on U.S. jobs growth in June has alleviated some concerns that the country is already in a recession; that should make it easier for the Federal Reserve to proceed with interest-rate increases of 75 basis points (0.75 percentage point), or three times as fast as in past rate-hiking cycles.  As CoinDesk's George Kaloudis wrote Sunday in his ""Crypto Long & Short"" column: ""A 75 basis point increase to interest rates in July is basically a foregone conclusion at this point.""  And Oanda Senior Market Analyst Ed Moya wrote last week: ""If inflation delivers another upside surprise, the September meeting could see expectations fully priced in a half-point rate increase but that could easily go up to 75 basis points.""  Bank of Japan watchers are assessing what the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe might imply for the nation's monetary policy, according to Bloomberg. Abe had been a strong advocate for ultra-easy financial conditions in the face of the country's economic stagnation.  Markets  Friday July, 8:  S&P 500: 3,899 -0.8%  DJIA: 31,338 -0.1%  Nasdaq: 11,365 -0.1%  Gold: $1,741 -1.3%  Insights  Ashley Alder's Mixed Crypto Legacy in Hong Kong  By Sam Reynolds  The U.K's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the nation's financial watchdog, announced Friday that Ashley Alder, the CEO of Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, will assume the post of chair in January 2023.  While Adler has a long list of accomplishments regulating Hong Kong’s traditional finance securities market, his curriculum vitae isn’t as stellar when dealing with crypto.  Certainly part of that is out of his control. As CoinDesk previously reported, the ""long shadow"" of China hangs over Hong Kong. China’s prohibition on crypto trading and Beijing’s fast erosion of Hong Kong's separate and autonomous legal system has chilled interest in the industry, and forced what interest there is into the narrow licensing regime that does exist.  Hong Kong's recently passed licensing regime for exchanges, which is overseen by Adler's SFC, excludes non-accredited investors from trading on these exchanges (called Virtual Asset Service Providers, or VASPs, per local terminology). For as much criticism as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Gary Gensler gets, this is never something that the SEC has considered.  Secondly, any exchange that serves Hong Kong, even if located abroad, would need to comply with these same licensing requirements.  Treated as a Security  Perhaps the bigger issue with the SFC’s treatment of crypto is the regulator treats it as a security. This is especially going against the grain when global regulatory trends have backed away from treating all crypto as securities and are only looking for specific instances instead.  The SFC’s bill requires exchanges to hold a “Type 1” license, which is used for dealing in securities.  Hex Trust’s Alessio Quaglini has complained before that requiring this sort of license is akin to forcing a square peg into a round hole because of the uniqueness of the digital assets industry. Hex has been awarded licenses in both Singapore and Dubai with the intent to open more offices abroad.  So while Alder’s TradFi regime saw Hong Kong lauded as one of the world’s freest economies by libertarian-leaning think tanks, that same assessment can’t be made for the future of finance. FTX voted with its feet and left the city, and only one firm, OSL, has bothered to get the license.  It’s not yet known who will replace Alder, but it’s unlikely to be someone who wants to take a balanced and fair approach to crypto.
