42373371,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt58298,1730243897,Enterprises Need DePIN More Than DePIN Needs Enterprises,"In a few weeks, Lisbon will again play host to one of the largest tech conferences in the world: WebSummit 2024. Like any good tech conference, it’s an opportunity for builders, enterprises, and investors to come together to scout and showcase innovation, to learn, and to gather market feedback that helps drive the next wave of the future.  In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the integration of DePINs, or Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, represents not just an innovation but a paradigm shift for corporate giants. DePINs are blockchain-powered ecosystems where physical infrastructure like energy grids, wireless networks, or transportation systems are managed and expanded through token incentives, democratizing access and control over essential services.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  Helium network, which launched its mainnet in 2020, is a notable early example of a community-driven wireless network that rewarded its citizen-network-suppliers significantly while reducing costs and increasing accessibility for users (in certain geographies anyway). Its Helium Mobile offering, while still augmented by TMobile, continues gaining traction and was recently cited to have 335,000 subscribers. Many are also familiar with early decentralized storage networks such as Filecoin, Storj, and Arweave, which are becoming more essential to the advancement of AI due to their scalability, cost efficiency, and decentralization.  Years after the first DePINs hit the market, we stand at the crossroads of digital transformation, with DePIN emerging as a critical piece of infrastructure for enterprises looking to leap forward in efficiency, security, and operational integrity. Here's why corporations need to be adopting DePIN.  Decentralization for enhanced security  The conventional centralized models of infrastructure management are fraught with vulnerabilities, from cyber-attacks to single points of failure. I don’t think I need to remind anyone of how the Crowdstrike incident earlier this year crippled the airline industry. DePIN, by leveraging blockchain technology, introduces a level of security that is both robust and inherently resilient.  Increased transparency combined with smart contract execution allow enterprises to decentralize, automate and ultimately de-risk the hosting of economically important infrastructure. This is because each node in the network holds a copy of the transaction history, which creates redundancy and makes unauthorized activity virtually impossible. Furthermore, keeping infra out of the control of monolithic third parties means political and geopolitical risk is mitigated, which should resonate deeply with some large corporations, or perhaps more likely citizens who should be more wary of public control of private industry.  Cost efficiency and operational scalability  For corporations, cost is king. DePIN technology promises a reduction in operational costs through the elimination of intermediaries and by fostering a model where infrastructure can be community-driven or self-sustaining through token economics. This means enterprises can scale their operations without proportional increases in infrastructure costs (an inherent pay-as-you-go design) DePIN could revolutionize how companies think about infrastructure, offering scalable, on-demand resources without large investments or capital requirements.  By offering services like localized computing power or data storage in places where infrastructure is notoriously bad, companies can tap into markets that are otherwise too costly or slow. Think of a more decentralized and smaller-scale version of Starlink. Enterprises always want to create or invest in frameworks that bring them more consumers. DePIN is the most efficient way to do this. Innovation will particularly benefit sectors like gaming, AI, or any data-intensive industry where decentralized solutions offer both efficiency and cost benefits..  Enterprise's Role in DePIN's Growth  The involvement of major corporations like Lufthansa and Deutsche Telekom in DePIN, as seen with their launches on the Peaq network, signals a powerful endorsement of this technology. Their participation isn't just about adopting new tech; it's about setting industry standards and influencing how other sectors might view and integrate DePIN. This kind of endorsement catalyzes further collaboration, integration, and innovation across industries, potentially leading to what could be described as the “DePIN era” in corporate technology adoption.  Outlier Ventures, along with Peaq, Impossible Cloud, and Acurast, are putting on a DePIN Day at Web Summit 2024, on Tuesday, November 12th.  We invite all enthusiasts, and especially corporations who are interested in DePIN, to join us in exploring and discussing why adoption of DePIN isn't just about keeping pace with technological trends; it's about thinking two steps ahead and being a technology leader.

35300644,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650632,1730242843,Record-Breaking Day: Spot Bitcoin ETF Trading Exceeds $3 Billion As BTC Eyes Record Peak,"As Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, inches closer to its all-time high of $73,700 reached in March, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market has re-emerged as a key driver of the cryptocurrency’s recent price surge. On Tuesday, total trading volume for spot Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $3 billion, coinciding with Bitcoin’s price briefly above the pivotal $73,000 mark for the first time in over 7 months. Bitcoin ETF Market Set To Surpass 1 Million BTC Holdings Soon Notably, crypto investor BigRig observed a remarkable uptick in Bitcoin ETF purchases over the past two weeks, reporting $2.673 billion in inflows since October 16. This accounts for a substantial 11.8% of total ETF inflows during this period, suggesting a robust interest from institutional and retail investors. BigRig also pointed out that, prior to Tuesday’s trading volume, this period represented the best day for ETF inflows. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Is About To Complete This Breakout To A Descending Megaphone Pattern, Is $1 Next? Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas added to the optimistic narrative by stating that US spot ETFs are on track to hold 1 million Bitcoin by next Wednesday, surpassing the holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, by mid-December with an average addition of about 17,000 BTC per week. However, Balchunas also cautioned that market volatility could impact these projections. “Anything can happen,” he noted, referencing the possibility of a sudden selloff that could delay the timeline. Conversely, if prices continue to rise and political factors, such as a potential Trump victory in the upcoming election, contribute to increased market enthusiasm, the expert believes that this influx of new investors could accelerate the pace of Bitcoin’s ascent to new highs. Whale Accumulation Spurs Optimism Despite heightened activity in the Bitcoin ETF market, the price of the largest cryptocurrency recently fell short of its all-time high, retracing to approximately $72,250 at the time of writing. However, there are positive indicators for Bitcoin bulls. The cryptocurrency has been consolidating above key support levels, with strong backing around the $66,000 mark. This support has effectively prevented any significant decline over the past week and has contributed to the ongoing rally. However, what would be a notable bullish indicator would be a sustained consolidation above the $70,000 level for the bulls, which could further demonstrate the strength of the current move. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Ready For A Breakout As Metrics Turn Bullish, What To Expect Market expert Miles Deutscher has been vocal about his bullish outlook for Bitcoin, particularly in the latter months of the year. He recently pointed out a significant trend: whales—large holders of Bitcoin—are accumulating the cryptocurrency at an “unprecedented pace.” This observation suggests that institutional demand for Bitcoin is currently outpacing retail interest, a shift that could have implications for massive price movements to the upside in the near future. Deutscher further highlighted that Bitcoin exchange reserves have reached all-time lows. This means that the amount of Bitcoin available on exchanges for trading has dwindled, signaling a supply squeeze.

35299720,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650544,1730241051,"Crypto Expert Discloses ‘Hidden Altcoin Gem’ With 1,900% Upside","In his latest video analysis titled “I Just APED Into This Hidden RWA Altcoin Gem! [20x Potential],” prominent crypto analyst Miles Deutscher unveiled Chintai (CHEX) as his latest high-conviction investment within the Real World Assets (RWA) sector. Deutscher believes Chintai could offer significant upside potential—up to 1,900% (20x)—in the upcoming market cycle. Deutscher has consistently highlighted RWA tokens as one of his top investment narratives, ranking third behind memecoins and AI for this crypto bull run. “When I look at narratives that can actually change the fabric of crypto and really offer a new value add, I think RWA is massive,” he stated. He emphasized the growing appeal of on-chain treasury yields, especially as traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) yields diminish and interest rates decline. The analyst previously capitalized on early investments in ONDO and Mantra (OM), both of which have seen substantial gains. ONDO, for instance, delivered a 7x return from his initial entry point. However, Deutscher now considers these assets to be reaching overvalued territories. “Valuation-wise, though, it’s pretty insane considering the fact that its market cap’s a billion, but it’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) is $7.1 billion,” he said regarding ONDO. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Unveils The ‘True Time To Sell It All’: Here’s When Deutscher has been reallocating his capital into what he perceives as undervalued opportunities within the RWA space. Alongside Clearpool (CPOOL), which he mentioned has already gained 42% since his initial disclosure, Chintai (CHEX) stands out as his newest and largest RWA position. “This one I’m also really, really bullish on. It’s tough for me to say if I’m most bullish on this, but it might be the one that I’m most bullish on in the RWA sector,” he remarked. Chintai differentiates itself by being one of the few RWA-focused layer-one blockchains regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). “If you know Singapore, they are so strict with due diligence. It’s really hard to get a license; they fought for a license and they’ve got it,” Deutscher noted. This regulatory approval positions Chintai to attract significant institutional capital, potentially channeling billions of dollars in total value locked (TVL) onto their chain. The analyst highlighted Chintai’s robust fundamentals, including its extensive list of major clients and partnerships, such as DHC, Finstable, and Greengate. “They are basically a marketplace for tokenization, an L1 blockchain for RWA tokenization,” he explained. The platform has already facilitated over $630 million worth of loans and is set to launch “OZEAN,” a blockchain for RWA yield supported by Optimism, early next year. Related Reading: Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Best Altcoins For The 2025 Bull Run From a valuation perspective, Deutscher sees substantial upside potential. Chintai currently has an FDV of approximately $250 million, significantly lower than Mantra’s $1.37 billion FDV. “If CHEX—even in a static market without the market growing at all—does a 6x, that’s just now matching Mantra,” he calculated. Considering the potential growth of the RWA market, the upside could be even more pronounced. “What if the RWA market 2x’s? Because I think it’s going to be a very strong narrative next year; then you could be looking at a 14x.” Despite its strong fundamentals, Deutscher acknowledges that Chintai’s lower valuation compared to its peers is largely due to a lack of market awareness. “Why is there that discrepancy despite the fundamentals being just as, if not more strong, for Chintai? Just marketing,” he observed. Mantra has excelled in marketing efforts, attracting considerable attention in the crypto community. “Once Chintai can improve its awareness—and I’m actually giving it more awareness by making this video—that is the only key that it’s missing.” On the technical front, Deutscher finds Chintai’s chart promising. “What I also like from a technical analysis perspective is the fact it’s hovering above this zone, which, if you are technically inclined, you have that technical invalidation,” he said, pointing out the potential for a significant move to previous highs. He remains cautiously optimistic about price targets, emphasizing prudent profit-taking strategies. “I don’t want to get carried away with crazy price targets… I’m never greedy in this market.” Deutscher concludes that Chintai’s combination of regulatory compliance, institutional appeal, and undervalued status makes it a compelling investment. “They can actually attract institutional capital because of the licensing and because of the product they’ve built,” he affirmed. At press time, CHEX traded at $0.2874.

The unlock may lead to ""some pronounced effects,"" as the amount of released tokens is multiple times larger than the average daily trading volume, Anagram partner David Shuttleworth said.  The native cryptocurrency of data availability blockchain Celestia (TIA) braces for volatility due to its massive supply event on October 30, which will nearly double the number of tokens in circulation.  Some 175 million of previously locked-up TIA, 80% of the current supply, will be released on Wednesday, in the largest single unlocking event since the token was launched last October, Tokenomist data shows. That's $920 million worth of tokens with prices slightly above $5 on exchanges.  Core contributors are scheduled to receive 58 million ($298 million) TIA tokens, per Tokenomist. 65 million ($332 million) tokens are allocated to early investors of the project's series A and B funding rounds, with another 52 million ($268 million) tokens for seed investors.  Cryptocurrency projects often lock a part of the token’s supply and release it gradually to prevent early investors and insiders from selling in large quantities immediately after they get the allocations. When the tokens are unlocked, they become available to sell, and thus, such events are usually considered bearish; often they induce price drops. However, sometimes investors front-run and may sell before the unlocking happens.  Read more: Large Crypto Token Unlocks Drive Prices Lower Within Two Weeks, Research Suggests  In TIA's case, prices have tumbled as much as 80% from the February peak of $21, and have consolidated in the $4-$6 range for multiple months. Meanwhile, funding rates for TIA perpetual futures sit in deeply negative territory, reaching a -90% annualized rate on crypto exchange Binance, CoinGlass data shows. This suggests traders are expecting declining prices or TIA holders are hedging their exposure leading into the unlock.  ""There could be some pronounced effects,"" David Shuttleworth, partner at Anagram, told CoinDesk, noting that the amount of tokens being unlocked is multiple times larger than the average daily trading volume between $50 million and $200 million over the past month. ""The broader timing, however, is favorable,"" he added, with bitcoin {{BTC}} trading near all-time highs and other majors including ether {{ETH}} and solana {{SOL}} also performing well.  Given the broad crypto market rally, the probability of TIA surprising traders with a rally following the unlock has increased, according to well-followed crypto analyst Will Clemente, founder of Reflexivity Research.  ""This BTC price action has further slid the probability of Thursday's TIA unlock being bearish towards 'no,'"" Clemente said in an X post.  ""6 months of reaccumulation after 80% drawdown, ton of OTC volume, most widely telegraphed unlock in crypto history, 9 figs [figures] short, BTC nearing ATHs,"" he added.

This breakout has ignited optimism among analysts, who expect further upside in the coming weeks as the US election draws near—a period historically marked by heightened volatility and market shifts. Critical data from CryptoQuant indicates that Open Interest has reached $22.6 billion, with half of these positions held by bears. If Bitcoin continues to climb, this setup creates a high risk of short liquidations, potentially accelerating buying pressure as prices push above $71,000. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Breaks Above Key Resistance ‘We Could See A 25% Rally’ – Top Analyst As momentum builds, the next few days will determine whether BTC can sustain its uptrend or if a consolidation phase below the all-time high will continue. Investors are closely watching these price levels, as a confirmed breakout could signal new highs for Bitcoin. At the same time, a stall might suggest a need for additional consolidation before a larger move. Bitcoin Bears In Serious Trouble Bitcoin bears are now at high risk of forced liquidations as a significant level of short position liquidity hovers above the $71,000 threshold. According to top analyst and macro investor Axel Adler, this scenario could ignite a powerful rally if short positions start liquidating en masse. Creating momentum that propels BTC beyond its all-time highs. Adler shared a CryptoQuant chart on X, noting that Bitcoin Open Interest has surged to $22.6 billion, with half of these positions held by bears. In his analysis, Adler emphasizes that the current market structure is poised for a major squeeze. “There’s no need to hesitate in liquidating short positions to drive the price up,” Adler states, suggesting that a cascade of liquidations above $71,000 could act as a launchpad for Bitcoin, taking it into uncharted price discovery levels. This process, known as a “short squeeze,” occurs when overleveraged short holders are forced to close their positions, resulting in large buy orders that send prices even higher. Related Reading: Solana Bullish Pattern Holds – Crypto Analyst Sets $202 Target If this scenario unfolds, Bitcoin wouldn’t be the only one benefiting. As BTC leads the market, a rally past previous highs could signal a fresh cycle for the entire crypto space. Altcoins typically follow Bitcoin’s lead, and the spillover effect could fuel a comprehensive bull run, with new highs across multiple assets. Investors are watching closely, as such a move could renew interest and investment in the crypto market, drawing in retail and institutional capital. With BTC on the edge of price discovery, the next few days may prove pivotal in shaping the market’s direction. BTC Testing Cruial Supply Bitcoin is testing a supply zone at $71,200, brushing up against the last resistance level before reaching its all-time high. Bulls appear firmly in control, with price action signaling a likely breakout above this level in the coming days. Breaking and holding above the $70,000 mark remains critical. This psychologically significant level reinforces bullish sentiment, encouraging more buyers to enter the market. However, a temporary retracement to gather liquidity at lower demand levels would benefit Bitcoin’s uptrend. A dip toward the $69,000 level, or even down to $66,500, would still align with a bullish outlook. It could attract further interest and create a healthier base for the next rally. These areas would allow Bitcoin to gather liquidity before making a stronger push toward new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Activity Spikes To 6-Week High – Smart Money Accumulation? Traders are watching, knowing that a sustained move above $71,200 could pave the way for price discovery beyond all-time highs.

35295997,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650482,1730233807,"Bitcoin Recovery Sparks Hope For $73,811 Breakout, New All-Time High In Sight?","Bitcoin’s recent bullish momentum has sparked optimism among traders and investors, as the cryptocurrency edges closer to its all-time high. Following a significant recovery, Bitcoin is once again climbing, with the pivotal $73,811 mark in sight. This renewed upward movement signals a potential breakout, raising the question: could Bitcoin be on the verge of a historic rally? With key indicators turning positive and confidence building in the market, BTC’s journey toward its record high could pave the way for a new chapter in its remarkable ascent. Specifically, this article aims to explore Bitcoin’s recent upbeat momentum and its implications for reaching new heights. Furthermore, by analyzing key technical indicators, market sentiment, and resistance levels, this article seeks to provide readers with insights into Bitcoin’s potential path to its all-time high, evaluating whether a breakout past $73,811 is on the horizon. The Road To Recovery: Bitcoin’s Recent Bullish Momentum After a recent recovery at $65,082, BTC’s price on the 4-hour chart has steadily gained strength, edging closer to its all-time high of $73,811 with an eye on a potential breakout. Trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), BTC shows a strong upward trend that supports the possibility of surpassing this record level. Meanwhile, an analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals promising potential for continued upward movement, as the RSI has recently surged from the neutral 50% mark to 77%. Typically, the RSI’s movement toward the 77% level is seen as a strong bullish indicator, suggesting that buyers remain in control, potentially paving the way for further upward price action. If this trend persists, it could indicate that BTC’s rally is well-supported by investor confidence and positive sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rallies Above $70K: Is a New High Within Reach? Also, on the daily chart, Bitcoin has demonstrated solid upward movement, highlighted by several bullish candlesticks after a successful rebound from the $65,082 level. This recovery has kept BTC trading above the 100-day SMA, underscoring sustained buying strength and a positive trend continuation. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a detailed examination of the RSI formation indicates renewed upbeat strength for Bitcoin as the indicator’s signal line has risen again to 68% after dropping to 55%, suggesting a sustained optimistic outlook. A rise to the 68% level usually signifies that BTC is experiencing increased buying pressure, as traders are becoming more hopeful about its future price performance. What A Breakout Above $73,811 Could Mean For Bitcoin A breakout above the $73,811 resistance level could mark a crucial turning point for Bitcoin’s future. Clearing this key threshold would not only strengthen bullish sentiment among investors but is also likely to spark a new wave of buying activity, driving prices higher in the pursuit of a new all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Through $65,000, Is “Uptober” Rally Just Getting Started? Nonetheless, if BTC fails to break above the $73,811 level, it may start to decline again towards the $65,082 support level. Should this support level be breached, it could lead to additional downward momentum, potentially pushing the price toward $60,152 and other lower ranges.

Taking this into consideration, a crypto analyst has unveiled a new technical pattern in the Dogecoin price chart called the ”Descending Megaphone.” The analyst has suggested that if Dogecoin can break out of this distinct pattern, it could set the stage for a significant rally to higher price targets. Dogecoin Price Eyes $1 Breakout Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) has pointed out that the Dogecoin daily candle has just closed with a breakout into a “Descending Megaphone pattern.” While this unique technical pattern is a sign of increasing volatility especially during a downtrend, a break above the upper boundary of this chat pattern could indicate a potential upward move. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Says 80-90% Correction Is Over With 100% Jump Imminent In the case of Dogecoin, if its price can move beyond the upper line of the Descending Megaphone pattern, it could signal the start of a huge rally. For more clarity, a Descending Megaphone is a bullish chart pattern formed by two diverging trend lines, with the upper line representing the resistance and the lower indicating support. The pattern typically looks like a megaphone with a downward tilt. According to Trader Tardigrade, despite entering this unique chart pattern, the Dogecoin price has been showing signs of strength and momentum on the daily chart. Looking at the meme coin’s daily chart, the analyst has set a price target of $0.2, predicting that Dogecoin could rise to this level as part of its price action within the Descending Megaphone pattern. Trader Tardigrade has shared that he is closely observing how the Dogecoin price behaves within this new pattern formation, paying particular attention to any movement towards the upper boundary of the Descending megaphone. Responding to his bullish predictions, a crypto community member remarked that a $1 price target remains a highly anticipated dream for Dogecoin Trader Tardigrade replied, asserting that this ambitious and coveted price target is no longer a dream for Dogecoin. Bitcoin Price Discovery To Influence DOGE Rally Following his price forecast for Dogecoin, another community member suggested that the Dogecoin price may not reach the $1 target set by Trader Tardigrade without Bitcoin undergoing a price discovery. To this, the analyst simply responded “step by step.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Stock To Flow Model Shows Price Is Ready For Next Phase Transition Above $100,000 The Bitcoin price discovery has been a central topic amongst various crypto analysts in the market lately. Notably, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Crypto Feras’ disclosed that if Bitcoin can break through critical price resistance levels, it could potentially revisit the $72,000, ultimately leading to a price discovery and an immense bullish situation. Considering that a Bitcoin bull run often precedes bullish movements for other cryptocurrencies, Trader Tardigrade has affirmed that after a price discovery, the Dogecoin price could enter a major rally. As of writing, the Dogecoin price was trading at $0.164, marking a staggering 13.72% increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

The world's largest crypto is now up nearly 75% year-to-date and has more than doubled from year-ago levels.  The roaring success of the spot ETFs, new monetary easing cycles across major economies, and rising victory odds for crypto-friendly presidential candidate Donald Trump are among the positive catalysts.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} surged to within a few dollars of a fresh all-time high price during U.S. trading hours Tuesday, rising to as much as $73,500 before pulling back a bit. The record high of $73,798 was touched on March 14 of this year.  At press time, the world's largest crypto was trading at $73,000, up 4.6% over the past 24 hours, roughly in line with the performance of the broader CoinDesk 20 Index.  Bitcoin has been in a consolidation phase for multiple grueling months since its March 14 peak , dropping to as low as just under $50,000 at one point over the summer, but mainly sitting in roughly the $60,000-$65,000 range. The action tested investors' patience and left many concerned that the bull market cycle begun in early 2023 had already topped out. Multiple attempts for new highs were met with heavy selling from bitcoin miners and long-term investors, while breakdowns were quickly arrested and bought up.  The recent gain has brought bitcoin's year-to-date advance to just shy of 75%. The price has also more than doubled from its level of one year ago, when a rally began to get underway as it became understood that U.S. regulators had finally moved towards greenlighting spot-based ETFs. That approval ultimately came on Jan. 10 of this year.  Those ETFs became wild successes, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) alone having taken in nearly $24 billion as of last week.  Among other catalysts for the rally are new monetary easing cycles begun in 2024 from nearly every major Western central bank as well as sizable fiscal and monetary stimulus from China, and the rising presidential election victory chances for the crypto-friendly GOP nominee Donald Trump.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/29/bitcoin-tops-735k-climbing-just-shy-of-new-record-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f8a3e3cf65a3ec422e0e7ff80e7d52c1401d29b-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Biden also spoke of the agreement between the nations to cooperate on law-enforcement matters, including illicit financial and cryptocurrency issues.  U.S. President Joe Biden called Bola Tinubu, the President of Nigeria, on Tuesday to personally thank him for the recent release of detained American Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan.  According to a Tuesday statement from the White House, Biden “underscored his appreciation for President Tinubu’s leadership” in securing Gambaryan’s release in the phone call.  Gambaryan, head of financial crime compliance at Binance, was released on humanitarian grounds last week, eight months after he was first taken into Nigerian custody and subsequently charged with money laundering and tax evasion as a proxy for his employer, which the Nigerian government accused of tanking the value of the naira. The Nigerian government has since dropped both charges against Gambaryan, though Binance still faces tax-evasion charges in the country.  While imprisoned in Nigeria’s notoriously dangerous Kuje Prison, Gambaryan’s health deteriorated. According to his family, he suffered malaria, pneumonia, tonsillitis and complications from a herniated disc in his back that left him struggling to walk.  Gambaryan’s plight attracted the attention of several members of Congress as well as a large swath of former government officials who urged the U.S. government to intervene on his behalf before his health deteriorated further.  The day Gambaryan was released from custody, the U.S. Department of State announced the formation of a new bilateral liaison group between the U.S. and Nigeria focused on cryptocurrency and illicit finance.  According to the White House’s statement, Biden and Tinubu discussed the “value of the U.S.-Nigeria partnership in addressing global challenges and advancing security and prosperity across multiple sectors,” and Biden “expressed appreciation for cooperation on law enforcement, including through the recently announced Bilateral Liaison Group on Illicit Finance and Cryptocurrencies.”",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/29/president-biden-thanks-nigerian-president-for-binance-execs-release-white-house,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0aba0a6662ad21a09decc9c9d5d9acc3a5f8ab08-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cardano (ADA) is also at a critical juncture, showing striking similarities to its price action in 2020—a year that saw ADA skyrocket by over 4,000% in under 12 months. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Breaks Above Key Resistance ‘We Could See A 25% Rally’ – Top Analyst Renowned analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis comparing ADA’s current market structure to November 2020. According to Martinez, ADA’s recent consolidation around key levels could set the stage for a significant upward surge, particularly following the upcoming U.S. election. Martinez’s analysis highlights Cardano’s pattern of explosive growth after periods of accumulation and points to the potential for a strong rally if Bitcoin breaks new highs. Investors are now closely watching ADA’s price movement, eager to see if it can replicate its historic bull run. As the market prepares for a possible shift, Cardano’s performance in the coming weeks could offer insight into broader altcoin momentum in this cycle. The next moves could be decisive, making ADA one to watch in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Cardano Following 2020 Bullish Pattern Cardano has captured the attention of analysts and investors who see its current consolidation as a possible signal of accumulation, hinting at a strong move up ahead. Well-known analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, comparing Cardano’s current price behavior and its pattern in 2020—a year in which ADA experienced an extraordinary 4,000% surge. According to Martinez, Cardano’s price action is displaying a similar setup, suggesting the possibility of a breakout around November 18, roughly two weeks after the U.S. elections. This timeline aligns with historical patterns, where ADA consolidates before explosive upward moves. Martinez’s analysis points to a long-term bullish target of $6.30, representing a potential 2,000% increase from current levels. He anticipates that if it materializes, this rally could lead to a market top for Cardano around September 2025. This prediction is based on ADA’s cyclical price trends, where significant rallies have historically followed periods of low volatility and accumulation, driven by market sentiment and broader crypto adoption. Related Reading: GOAT Outpaces PEPE Growing To $900M Market Cap In 2 Weeks – Details Many investors are now watching ADA closely, as such a rally would not only be significant for Cardano but could signal a broader bullish momentum across altcoins. Cardano’s current price level has attracted a mix of institutional and retail investors seeking opportunities before what could be a substantial move. With both on-chain data and technical indicators supporting a bullish outlook, ADA’s upcoming price action may set the tone for the altcoin market in the coming months. If history repeats, Cardano could be primed for one of its most powerful surges, attracting new interest and capital into the ecosystem. ADA Technical Levels Cardano is trading at $0.346 after experiencing a clear rejection from the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.351. This key level has been pivotal, as a break above it and holding it as support would signal a potential shift toward a short-term uptrend. For bulls aiming to regain control over ADA’s price action, establishing a firm foothold above the 200 EMA is essential, as it would likely attract buying interest and strengthen upward momentum. Additionally, the $0.37 supply zone presents another significant hurdle for ADA, as bulls have struggled to reclaim this level since early October. This resistance zone has repeatedly capped price action, indicating that substantial buying pressure is necessary to break through and sustain gains beyond this mark. A bullish trend could gain traction if ADA breaches the 200 EMA and the $0.37 supply zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Positions Face Serious Risk Above $68,500 – Details However, if these levels remain unclaimed, ADA’s price is likely to continue consolidating sideways in the near term. Such a pattern would allow the market to stabilize and potentially attract fresh demand before attempting another breakout, though it may delay any significant upward movement for ADA.

42373369,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt58288,1730223734,"Coinbase Revenue May Be Hurt by Lower Trading Volumes, Regulatory Uncertainty, Analysts Say","Analysts expect a slowdown in spot trading volume to hurt Coinbase's revenue in the third quarter.  The exchange reports Q3 earnings post-market on Wednesday.  Third quarter revenue is forecasted to decline about 13% from the second quarter, according to FactSet.  Wall Street analysts expect a further slowdown in spot trading volume for Coinbase (COIN) in the third quarter, partly triggered by a lack of catalysts for crypto and an uncertain regulatory environment heading into the presidential election.  The crypto exchange, when it reports its earnings post-market on Wednesday, is expected to experience a revenue decline of about 13% in the third quarter, to $1.26 billion from $1.45 billion in the last quarter, according to estimates on FactSet. Meanwhile, the earnings per share (EPS) are forecasted to be $0.46, up from $0.14 in the second quarter.  “Volumes continued to soften through the quarter and we shake out quite a bit below the Street, largely on weaker retail transaction revenues,” Barclays analyst Benjamin Buddish wrote in a note. He has an equal weight rating on the stock and raised its price target to $175 from $169 while cutting the EPS estimate to $1.05 from $1.62 in the third quarter.  The third-quarter slowdown in trading volume is not just Coinbase-specific but an industry-wide phenomenon. Data from The Block shows that roughly $3.3 trillion was traded on all crypto exchanges, compared to $3.92 trillion in the second quarter. Coinbase competitor Robinhood (HOOD) is also set to report third quarter earnings after-market on Wednesday.  Additionally, the data revealed that crypto exchange Crypto.com has been the most popular trading venue for investors in the North American region since July when it first overtook Coinbase as the exchange with the highest trading volume. One of the reasons why Coinbase might have fallen short in volume is due to Crypto.com’s offering of a wider range of tokens.  Analysts also believe that regulatory uncertainty due to the upcoming presidential election results was one of the main drivers behind lower trading volumes on U.S. exchanges. According to Oppenheimer, the spot volume outside of North America increased 61% from the previous quarter. “We believe lack of catalysts and US election overhang have negatively impacted bitcoin,” Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau wrote. “International volume was a bright spot.”  The investment bank estimates that third-quarter revenue will be $1.29 billion and EPS will be $0.40. It has an outperform rating on Coinbase and a price target of $282 over the next 12 to 18 months.  Lower staking revenue  In addition to lower revenue from trading fees, which continues to be Coinbase’s main stream of income, J.P. Morgan’s Kenneth Worthington expects lower revenue from the exchange’s staking services. This is largely driven by ether {{ETH}} underperforming in the third quarter, down roughly 24% from Q2, according to the bank.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been trading in the rough range of $2,330 to $2760 since August, with the current price at $2624 as of press time. In the months from April to June, that range was much higher, at $3,503 to $3,368.  “Ether [has] particularly underperformed [during the quarter] despite seeing the launch of its spot ether ETPs intra-quarter,” Worthington wrote. “We see this market cap contraction particularly weighing on Coinbase’s staking revenue in 3Q and subscriptions and services revenue overall.”  Subscription and services revenue was one of the bright spots in the second quarter, growing 17% from Q1. The main catalysts for the uptick were higher average USDC on-platform balances and USDC market capitalization.  J.P. Morgan, which rates the stock neutral, raised its price target to $196 from $180. However, it sees EPS landing anywhere between $0.42 and $0.54 for the third quarter.  Shares of the exchange are up nearly 30% year-to-date, but they are currently 21% down from their peak of $279.71 in March.

Our thesis suggests minimal Bitcoin headwind until April 2025, then gradual downward pressure through October 2025 before entering a bear market. We maintain our $100,000 base case price targets while positioning for a potential $200,000 Bitcoin. Our current strategy involves tilting our Bitcoin portfolio into CLSK and MARA, then look for opportunity to short put options when Bitcoin hits $100,000 before April 2025. Introduction In our previous thesis , we identified 2 key observations that always accompany a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) bull run towards a new all-time high ('ATH'). We first identified a time variable that suggests that Bitcoin's bull run towards an ATH typically occurs roughly 5 to 6 months after the halving event. For this cycle, that would fall between 27th September 2024 and 17th October 2024. The second observation identified is a trend-following indicator used to track market cycles, which is known as the Coppock Curve. This indicator typically turns positive prior to Bitcoin's bull run toward a new ATH. These 2 observations have been consistent since Bitcoin's inception and are still valid as shown in Figure 1. Fig 1. Coppock Curve and Bitcoin's Bull Run (Author) Over the past 2 months, my team and I've gone through major Bitcoin mining companies to examine which has the best fundamentals to beat Bitcoin and the Bitcoin mining sector. The intention was to try to time the market by tilting our Bitcoin holdings into the best of Bitcoin mining companies to amplify returns. What we aim to replicate are our account-doubling plays in the 2020-2024 halving cycle. On one occasion, we found BITF to lag the sector and we issued a ""Strong Buy' rating at $4.21, with a target price of $8.50 . In addition, we also suggested shorting call options to amplify returns at $8.50. The overall maneuver netted us more than 100% return. On another occasion, we found CLSK to be lagging the sector with a 200% upside which was later realized in half a year. This play also netted us about 100% return. You can read our current findings on each major Bitcoin mining company here below: CleanSpark ( CLSK ): here Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ): here Iris Energy ( IREN ): here Riot Platforms ( RIOT ): here Bitfarms ( BITF ): here TLDR: We found CLSK and MARA to be favorable. The working hypothesis for these outstanding plays is that we were able to find the alpha of Bitcoin mining companies through fundamentals and trade their Betas, both with respect to our Bitcoin outlook. Therefore, our Bitcoin outlook is the cornerstone of our entire investment strategy. In this article, we're going to update our thesis and discuss the latest development in the Bitcoin Halving Cycle. We'll also discuss what we expect for the next 12-month period and detail our action plans. Latest and Expected Future Development in The Bitcoin Halving Cycle The latest development in Bitcoin price action saw Bitcoin heading in our expected direction with a 14% price increase since our last coverage 2 months ago. As of the time of writing, we can say that Bitcoin has fulfilled the 2 criteria for us to expect a bull run to $100,000. During the past 2 months, the Coppock Curve has finally turned positive on the weekly chart, while the Bitcoin price nearly hit $70k (about $69,400) (Fig 2) within the 6 months after the halving event. These events suggest that stage 1 of the Bitcoin bull market is officially concluded and we're now in the 2nd stage of the bull market. This is a very bullish development for Bitcoin. ( Recall that stage 1 of the bull market is where Bitcoin reclaims previous ATHs (usually 5-6 months after the halving event), while stage 2 of the bull market is where Bitcoin hits new ATHs) Fig 2. Coppock Curve Turned Positive and Bitcoin Heading to ATH. (Author) So what should we expect in this 2nd stage of Bitcoin's bull run? Firstly, we expect this bull run to last until October 2025, which is about 1 year from now. This observation is based on the lengthening of Bitcoin's bull run over each Halving cycle (Fig 3). During the 2012-2016 halving cycle, Bitcoin's bull run lasted about a year, from November 2012 (Bitcoin's first halving event) to November 2013. During the following 2016-2020 halving cycle, the duration of Bitcoin's bull run increased from 1 year to 1.5 years, from July 2016 to Dec 2017. During the previous 2020-2024 halving cycle, the duration of Bitcoin's bull run remained at about 1.5 years, from May 2020 to about November 2021. Fig 3. The Duration of Bitcoin's Bull Market During Each Halving Cycle. (Author) Secondly, we expect Bitcoin to provide a 2x-3x upside within this 1 year. This is based on the diminishing return observed over past bull cycles. During the 2012-2016 cycle, Bitcoin returned 100x (from $12 to $12,000) within 1 year of the Bitcoin halving cycle. However, Bitcoin's return in the following 2016-2020 cycle was reduced from 100x to 32x (from ~$660 to $19,000) and was further reduced to 8x (from $9,000 to $69,000) in the following 2020-2024 cycle. Extrapolating this on a linear scale suggests only a 2x-3x return for the current cycle. Unfortunately, even if we know the magnitude of Bitcoin's bull run, the price target varies widely based on the assumed base price. The 1st possible base price is the 50% price level between the high of the bull market and the low of the bear market of the previous halving cycle (Fig 2). The 2016-2020 bull market started at about $660 per Bitcoin, which is 50% between the high of the bull run (~$1,150) and the low of the bear market (~$200) in the 2012-2016 cycle. The 2020-2024 bull market kicked off at ~$9,000, which is also about 50% between the high of the bull run (~$19,000) and the low of the bear market (~$3,200) in the 2016-2020 cycle. Hence, the base price for the current bull market would be $42,500 (= [$69,000+16,000]/2). A 2x-3x return implies a Bitcoin price target between $85,000 to $127,500. This price target range is also supported by the decade-old resistance (at ~$90,000) that was never broken but will eventually be broken . ... as credible as this Bitcoin Halving Cycle could get, this cycle could be its last as this thesis can only project up to $90,000 (the resistance level). On aggregate, we set our base case price target to be $100,000, which also accounts for the psychology of whole numbers, or "" parity "" in FOREX, which is significant. The 2nd possible base price is $65,000, which is the actual Bitcoin price entering the current bull market. Based on this base price, our bull case price targets see Bitcoin reaching as high as $130,000 (if 2x) to $195,000 (if 3x; rounded to $200,000 for parity and psychology of whole numbers). The risk to the validity of this $65,000 base price is that it might've been nothing more than a 'side-effect' of Bitcoin's historic spot ETF approval where Bitcoin price appreciated earlier than in the past. Only time will tell which is the correct base price. Nevertheless, both base prices result in highly bullish price targets for Bitcoin, and it is also possible to be conservative while positioning for the potential bull case scenario. Our Action Plan We expect Bitcoin to comfortably reach $100,000 with minimal headwind before April 2025 (not October 2025). This marks the minimum duration of a Bitcoin bull market over the past decade. Hence, we've executed our strategy to tilt our Bitcoin portfolio into Bitcoin mining companies to trade the Beta. In light of this updated thesis, we've also adjusted our strategy to position ourselves for the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $200,000. Right now, we've tilted our Bitcoin portfolio into CLSK and MARA. CLSK remains our top choice as it offers the highest upside and the most undervalued in the sector based on Implied Bitcoin Price. In addition, We also picked MARA as for a mean reversion play . So far, CLSK performed the best, followed closely by RIOT, and then MARA. You can read why we chose to forgo RIOT even though it is trading at a significant discount on Price-to-Book ratio ('PBR') here . Data by YCharts If Bitcoin reaches $90,000 as we expect, we'll consolidate the portfolio back to 100% Bitcoin by selling all Bitcoin mining companies. This aligns with our stance to be conservative. The adjustment of our strategy is to also short in-the-money put options on Bitcoin mining companies (yet to be determined, depending on valuations and fundamentals at that time) and use the collected premiums to increase the Bitcoin holdings. This will help us position ourselves for further Bitcoin price appreciation while retaining our conservativeness. However, this adjustment is contingent on the timing of Bitcoin hitting $90,000. We have to assess whether the risk to earn the time value is justified. For instance, if Bitcoin hits $90,000 3 months before April 2025, it's very likely for us to execute this trade. After that, we'll start to prepare for the bear market. Conclusion To conclude, our thesis, which is based on the decade-old halving cycle, suggests minimal headwind between now and April 2025. Then, we expect downward pressure will start mounting gradually through October 2025. Hence, we expect this period to be the golden opportunity to be positioned for heavy bullish bias. This can come in the form of call options on Bitcoin or even call options on Bitcoin mining companies. Unfortunately, our risk profile only allowed us to stay in the spot market, with some exposure to short puts. Hence, we've singled out CLSK and MARA as our pick to tilt our Bitcoin portfolio into. In light of our new Bitcoin price target, we look to replicate our past BITF play by shorting put options as a way to take profits while having exposure to more Bitcoin upside. Unlike the past cycle, there is added complexity to the current bull run. There is a wide range of price targets depending on the assumed base price, and every price target resulted in breaking the decade-old resistance. Therefore, we have to revisit our thesis more frequently based on new developments in Bitcoin's, especially if it breaks the decade old resistance level.

42373377,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt582D8,1730220664,Crypto Ghosted in U.S. Treasury Department's New Strategy on Financial Inclusion,"A new U.S. strategy to promote financial inclusion isn't leaning on crypto as an option, but it did briefly mention the technology as a risk.  The Biden administration push comes as Vice President Kamala Harris has been warming up to crypto during her presidential election bid.  The U.S. Treasury Department has a new strategy for financial inclusion to help people get access to the financial system, but the 35-page report references cryptocurrency only once – to tout Treasury's work on flagging the industry's hazards.  While Vice President Kamala Harris has said on the campaign trail she'll encourage crypto as a part of her economic agenda, the administration she's currently working for is keeping digital assets at arm's length in what may be the Treasury's final mention of cryptocurrency before next week's election.  The Biden administration's Treasury Department noted in the Tuesday report that it ""cultivates financial inclusion by developing and promoting research,"" and — to that end — it had issued a report in 2022 on the ""risks related to digital assets.""  ""Access to safe, affordable financial products and unbiased information can help all Americans pursue financial security,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is set to say at a banking event in New York on Tuesday, according to her prepared remarks in which she'll call for the bankers' ""active partnership"" in the new strategy.  From its start, the crypto sector has made a case for itself as a low-barrier entree into finance. That's been among the core selling points, for instance, from industry lobbyists as they explain digital assets to lawmakers and regulators. But while international remittances have been an obvious little-guy use case for crypto, Treasury doesn't seem to have been moved by the industry's inclusion arguments.  Liberal-leaning groups such as the Center for American Progress have argued that the claim from crypto advocates about its benefits for financial inclusion ""does not hold up to scrutiny,"" and the Brookings Institution also sought to debunk that narrative.  It's unclear whether the vice president's office would have had any say in the Treasury's latest strategy, though it would seem to contrast with the crypto openness her campaign has been signaling. While Harris' election opponent, former President Donald Trump, has made his recent crypto enthusiasm a prominent part of his 2024 campaign, his own administration's Securities and Exchange Commission was the first to bring a major case that attacked the legal foundation of Ripple.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/29/crypto-ghosted-in-us-treasury-departments-new-strategy-on-financial-inclusion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b751c64af19824fc862118663629188f655c38e-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35289284,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650477,1730219450,"Bitcoin Price Skyrockets Above $71,000: Key Reasons Explained","The Bitcoin price has surged past the $71,000 mark today. Over the past five days, Bitcoin’s price has rallied by more than 8.5%, climbing from $65,600 to as high as $71,118 on October 29. In the last 24 hours alone, the BTC price has increased by 3.8%. This upward momentum can be attributed to four key factors: #1 Bitcoin ETFs Attract Massive Inflows The surge in Bitcoin’s price is closely linked to substantial inflows into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Yesterday witnessed massive ETF flows totaling $479.4 million. BlackRock led the inflows with $315.2 million, followed by Fidelity at $44.1 million, Ark with $59.8 million, and Bitwise at $38.7 million. These significant investments coincided with Bitcoin’s price movement from $68,000 to over $71,000. Leading on-chain analyst James “Checkmate” Check highlighted a divergence between Bitcoin ETF inflows and CME Open Interest. He noted “We have a divergence between Bitcoin ETF Inflows and CME Open Interest. ETF Inflows are ticking meaningfully higher, CME Open Interest is up, but not as much GBTC outflows are also minimal. We’re seeing true directional ETF inflows, and less so cash and carry trades.” The divergence suggests that investors are favoring direct exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs rather than engaging in cash and carry trades involving futures contracts. The carry trade strategy in the context of US spot Bitcoin ETFs and CME futures involves buying the ETF (tracking the spot price of Bitcoin) and simultaneously shorting Bitcoin futures on the CME. This approach aims to capitalize on price differences when futures trade at a premium to the spot price (contango). The notable shift toward ETFs indicates a bullish sentiment among investors, anticipating further price appreciation. #2 The “Trump Trade” Political developments are also influencing Bitcoin’s recent rally. Singapore-based QCP Capital commented on the impact of former President Donald Trump’s interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which has gained over 32 million views and driven his Polymarket odds above 66%. Despite “crypto” being touted as the “Trump Trade,” Bitcoin’s correlation with Trump’s potential election victory seems to fuel the Bitcoin price rally. QCP Capital also noted that Bitcoin is up only 8% this “Uptober,” compared to an average of 21% in previous Octobers. They stated, “If spot holds at these levels, this October would mark Bitcoin’s fourth-worst performance in the past decade.” With total BTC perpetual futures open interest across exchanges standing at $27 billion—approaching this year’s peak—a breakout above $70,000 could trigger new all-time highs, especially with more leveraged longs joining in. #3 Shorts Squeeze Amplifies Price Surge Market data indicates a significant shorts squeeze contributing to Bitcoin’s price spike. According to Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, 65,622 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations across the entire crypto market amounting to $228.51 million. Of this, $169.47 million were short liquidations. Specifically for Bitcoin, $83.61 million in shorts were liquidated. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance’s BTCUSDT pair, valued at $18 million. The substantial liquidation of short positions suggests that many traders were betting on a price decline and were forced to close their positions as the market moved against them. This mass unwinding of shorts can accelerate upward price movements as traders buy back into the market to cover their positions. #4 Whales Increase Buying Activity Large-scale investors, often referred to as “whales,” are playing a pivotal role in the current rally. CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet observed that Bitcoin’s rally continues, led by activity on the Binance exchange. He pointed out that Binance whales began significant involvement in the market two weeks ago during Asian trading hours, and recent declines in the Coinbase Premium Gap (CPG) alongside price increases are “a clear sign of Binance whales’ intervention. Mignolet emphasized that this should not be interpreted as a decline in US demand, but an even stronger buying pressure from Binance. Over the past two weeks, demand for US Bitcoin spot ETFs has surged, with a net inflow of approximately 47,000 Bitcoin. Since most ETF products use Coinbase, movements in CPG data are closely tied to ETF demand. He concluded, “The current Bitcoin price is being driven by Binance whales, with sustained inflows of US capital.” At press time, BTC traded at $71,340.

Integrating Bridge allows lower-cost onramp and offramp for buyers and sellers of agricultural commodities and products to use AgriDex as a cross-border payment and settlement venue using Circle's USDC {{USDC}} stablecoin on the Solana {{SOL}} network, said Henry Duckworth, co-founder and CEO of AgriDex.  Buyers and sellers don't need to hold crypto, they can initiate and receive transactions in their local currencies, using blockchain tech and USDC as an intermediary.  The integration offers an example for Striple's playbook to acquire Bridge for $1.1 billion earlier this month to expand the payments processor giant's capabilities to stablecoins. Stablecoins are being increasingly used as a payment vehicle in emerging regions as a cheaper alternative for traditional banking rails.  Read more: Circle's Allaire: Stablecoins Could Expand by Trillions in 10 Years, Will Be Integral Part of Global Financial System  ""This collaboration highlights the power of stablecoins to solve real-world challenges in global markets,” said Zach Abrams, co-founder and CEO of Bridge.  Henry Duckworth, co-founder and CEO of AgriDex, said that growing up in Zimbabwe where waves of currency devaluation has plagued the country's economy and his experience as a commodities trader at trading behemoth Trafigura inspired him to build AgriDex to streamline cross-border payments for agricultural goods producers.  On AgriDex, agricultural producers can list, execute and settle trades tracking the whole process within the platform. Trades are secured with non-fungible tokens (NFT) containing details of the transaction.  While traditional banking payment rails usually cost 2%-4% in fees when producers export their goods and can take multiple business days to settle, AgriDex lowers fees to around fifty basis points, Duckworth explained.

With a breakout on the horizon, the analyst also provided insights into price targets that XRP could hit as it moves to the upside. XRP Price Ready For A Breakout Random Crypto Pal predicted in X post that the XRP price was ready for a breakout while sharing a picture of the XRP monthly chart. He remarked that an “explosion is coming,” indicating that the price rally will be parabolic. The analyst made this claim while noting that XRP has recorded a perfect retest of both trend lines. Related Reading: ‘Bird Beak Sign’ Appears On Bitcoin Price Heikin Ashi Chart, Analyst Explain What This Means The accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could rise to as high as its current ATH of $3.84 when it records this price breakout. XRP has consolidated for about seven years since 2018, when it reached its current ATH. Since then, the XRP community has eagerly anticipated a price breakout, which never came in the 2021 bull run. However, this time looks different, considering that XRP has finally gained legal clarity and a non-security status in the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Meanwhile, on-chain metrics have turned bullish and support an XRP price breakout. The active addresses on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) have hit a six-month high, indicating renewed interest in the coin among crypto investors. New investors are also flocking into the XRP ecosystem, as new addresses on the network have surged by over 10%. Daily transactions on the network are also on the rise, which shows that investors are actively trading using XRP. Therefore, these bullish on-chain metrics could also contribute to the XRP rally, which Random Crypto Pal predicts is on the horizon. Price Could Reach Triple Digits Crypto analyst Javon Marks has again reaffirmed that the XRP price could reach triple digits when this price breakout finally occurs. In an X post, the analyst alluded to the historical price gains that XRP recorded in the 2017 bull run to prove why the coin could reach $200. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Says 80-90% Correction Is Over With 100% Jump Imminent His accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could enjoy a price breakout by year-end and a massive rally that will last until year-end 2025, around when the crypto will hit $200. Interestingly, crypto analyst Dark Defender also echoed a similar sentiment when he revealed in an X post that the XRP bull run will last from November 2024 to November 2025. Meanwhile, Javon Marks noted the similarities between the current XRP price action and that of 2017 are “major.” He remarked that this time around is larger, which means that the result of the price breakout could be greater than the one witnessed in the 2017 bull run.

Bitcoin {{BTC}} miner HIVE Digital (HIVE) is expected to more than double its hashrate in the next 12 months, broker Cantor said in a research report Tuesday, initiating coverage of the stock.  Cantor assumed coverage of HIVE with an overweight rating and a $9 price target. The shares rose about 3.6% on Tuesday, trading around $4.26.  The broker said it expects the miner to ""more than double its hashrate over the next year."" Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.  HIVE is expected to grow its hashrate from 5.5 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 13 EH/s by the end of next year, Cantor said, and this ""upcoming growth inflection"" has not been priced in by the shares.  The company's plans in artificial intelligence (AI) and high performance computing (HPC) are potentially more enticing to investors, the report said.  ""Its eyes are set on its GPU cloud model named HIVE Cloud,"" analysts Brett Knoblauch and Thomas Shinske wrote, noting that the miner is targeting $100 million of annual recurring revenue (ARR) by the end of next year.

35285357,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650571,1730210759,Bitcoin Triggers Golden Cross: What This Means For The Crypto Trend,"Bitcoin price is now above $70,000 per coin. The recent rally back toward local all-time highs has carried BTCUSD high enough to causes two important moving averages to form a “Golden Cross.” This signal has appeared twice since the bear market bottom and yielded significant results. Let’s take a look at the data and the most recent signal now that it has confirmed. Bitcoin Daily Golden Cross: 50-Day And 200-Day Moving Averages As pictured above, BTCUSD has triggered a daily golden cross of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. In technical analysis, a golden cross happens when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. This typically suggests that there is an actively trending environment and price is expected to appreciate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash ‘Buy’ Signal: Analysts See New Highs On The Horizon The opposite, bearish signal is referred to as a death cross. The chart above also depicts a death cross in August 2024. However, its appearance didn’t lead to a prolonged downtrend. Could this also mean that this latest golden cross might not produce a sustainable uptrend? BTCUSD Golden Cross And Death Cross Recent History Zooming out provides a more clear picture of the signal’s effectiveness since the bear market bottom in November 2022. BTCUSD rising from bear market lows around $16,000 to $23,000 was enough to pull the 50-day moving average above the 200-day average, triggering the first golden cross of 2023. This kept Bitcoin trending higher until it reached roughly $32,000, then fell to retest lows around $25,000. The bearish short-term price action then triggered a death cross. Here, much like we saw in 2024, Bitcoin trended sideways and avoided a downtrend. It didn’t take much upside to force another golden cross. From that golden cross, BTCUSD rallied another 100%, doubling in price. The chart above shows that the golden cross in October 2024 occurred just months after the death cross, just like it did in late 2024. Could that mean another 100% rally from current levels? If so, Bitcoin price could reach as high as $140,000 before beginning to show weakness. Buy And Hold: Using Moving Average Crosses As A Trading System Using the 50-day and 200-day moving averages as a buy and hold trading system starting from 2018 would have yielded significant results. The first golden cross fired in April 2019 at around $5,000 per BTC. A death cross in October 2019 closed out the trade and sold some coins. A quick golden cross and death cross combo in early 2020 led to a small loss. May 2020’s golden cross more than made up for it, triggering when Bitcoin was trading just below $10,000. The trade stayed open while Bitcoin blasted off into its most bullish trend in recent years and eventually closed with the next death cross in Jun 2021 at around $35,000 per BTC. This kept $25,000 in profit from the trade, combined with the initial $4,000 profit from the early 2019 trade to make $29,000. The small loss takes the total closer to $28,500. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominates $3.4 Billion October Crypto Inflows—What’s Behind the Boom? In September 2021, BTCUSD golden crossed again at around $45,000, only to shortly later death cross at $3,000 lower. This death cross stayed active until Bitcoin shed another $30,000. Fortunately, using the two moving averages as a buy and hold trading system meant the death cross moved you to cash – avoiding the worst of the bear market. Come early 2023, Bitcoin was ready to begin a new uptrend and the golden cross triggered at $23,000. A death cross formed at $27,000, keeping another $6,000 worth of profits. Another golden cross in October 2023 triggered at $35,000, riding all the way to $62,000 when the most recent death cross closed out the trade. In six trades total, the 50/200MA trading system would have earned approximately $58,500 as Bitcoin traveled from around $5,000 to $74,000. Four out of the six trades were profitable and the two losses were relatively minor when compared to the profits generated. Tony Severino, CMT is the author of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter.

Other Ethereum staking services, which functioned as third-party platforms for the wallet, had also been sued.  Many crypto companies have laid off part of its workforce in the past years as high interest rates have left marks on many balance sheets and came at a time when the SEC was doubling down its enforcements on crypto-native firms, leading to increased spending on legal fees.  In an attempt to fight back against the regulator, Consensys earlier this year sued the SEC for regulatory overreach, arguing that it is attempting a power grab over Ethereum.

42373477,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmWAH,1730209500,Kraken Picked Optimism's 'Superchain' After Getting a Pile of OP Tokens,"Crypto exchange Kraken announced last week that it will build a layer-2 network atop Optimism's OP Stack blockchain framework.  The deal was reached early this year, involving a grant of 25 million OP tokens, at the time worth roughly $100 million.  Kraken, a major U.S. crypto exchange, shared last week that it would launch a layer-2 called Ink, relying upon the Optimism's blockchain ecosystem's OP Stack framework – and become part of the fast-growing ""Superchain"" that also includes layer-2 networks from the crypto exchange Coinbase along with the electronics giant Sony and decentralized exchange Uniswap.  But there was a price: Both projects have confirmed to CoinDesk that the Optimism Foundation agreed to provide grants to Kraken in the amount of 25 million OP tokens – worth roughly $100 million earlier this year, when the deal was struck, and now valued at about $42.5 million.  The deal, which was finalized around January or February, paved the way for Kraken to use Optimism’s OP Stack, a customizable toolkit that lets users create their own layer-2 rollups based on Optimism’s technology.  Kraken clarified with CoinDesk that under the deal, the token allocation would be paid to Kraken in grants over a time period. On Jan. 1 , the OP token was worth $3.99, according to CoinGecko, reaching a high of $4.06 on Feb. 20 during that time period. It now trades around $1.70.  The Optimism Foundation confirmed the number of tokens involved in the deal and declined to comment further.  According to Andrew Koller, founder of Ink, the number is similar to various other deals that are part of the Superchain ecosystem.  “And it was actually Optimism that proposed that number first, and it was very in line with what other Superchain participants have gotten,” Koller told CoinDesk in an interview.  Optimism's growth  Layer-2 networks have been popping up all over the Ethereum ecosystem over the past year. Crypto exchange Coinbase famously launched their Base layer-2 network in August of 2023 with OP Stack. Since then, decentralized exchange Uniswap shared that it would launch a layer-2 on OP Stack called Unichain, and electronics giant Sony shared it was also coming out with a layer-2 called Soneium based on Optimism’s technology.  AI pioneer Sam Altman’s blockchain project, World, known for its controversial iris-scanning orbs, went live with its layer-2 Worldchain in August, also built on OP Stack.  In a series of posts on X after CoinDesk published this story, the Optimism Foundation's chief growth officer, Ryan Wyatt, wrote that the deal included ""5M OP to help fund the engineering efforts for Ink, 20M for massive txn milestones to drive fees to the Collective.""  ""The Collective is not going to stop investing in developers,"" Wyatt added.  According to Koller, the grant with the Optimism Foundation is based on transactions per month, “each time you achieve one, then there's different tranches that get unlocked, and there's an initial unlock, and then the rest gets unlocked at each month.”  Base has a slightly different setup, being one of the first in the space under this program. Base disclosed in a blog post in August 2023 that it would receive up to 2.75% of the OP token supply over a six-year period. The total supply of OP tokens is currently close to 4.3 billion, which makes Base eligible to receive up to 118 million OP tokens.  For newer layer-2s in the Superchain, “it's just like a time-lock thing. And after them [Base], I think all Superchain participants are really driving that around activity,” Koller said.  Paid deals  Deals between layer-2 projects and big firms are not unheard of in the blockchain industry. In 2022, Polygon paid Starbucks $4 million in grants to build an NFT-powered loyalty program. The program was shuttered 18 months later.  At the time of the Starbucks deal, Polygon was led by Wyatt, who was ousted in 2023, according to a CoinDesk report. Wyatt joined the Optimism Foundation in November 2023, where he is the chief growth officer, in charge of onboarding more developers to build across the Optimism ecosystem.  “There's no blueprints of this stuff, so you're gonna make good decisions and bad decisions in this space. There's not a lot you can lend at,” Wyatt told CoinDesk in an interview this week, conducted before CoinDesk learned about the Kraken deal.

Cipher Mining's strategic hardware purchases and hosting capacity expansion have made it an appealing stock, with a 67% increase since my December ""buy"" rating. Q3 is expected to show a revenue decline due to increased mining and electricity costs, but Cipher's prudent ""hold-some, sell-some"" Bitcoin strategy aids liquidity. Future success hinges on Bitcoin's price; well-positioned mining stocks like CIFR are poised for growth as the market enters a bull season. While crypto-exposed investors anticipate the post-halving price momentum for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), I believe that analyzing Bitcoin mining stocks and other crypto-related stocks should take more of a bottom-up approach at this stage. A Bitcoin miner that has well navigated the post-halving challenges and shown operational resilience through strategic capacity expansion as well as in its financials would be in a ready position to capitalize on Bitcoin’s momentum. That's why the discussion of the wider crypto market trend will take a back seat in this analysis, and the focus will be more on the granular details of Cipher Mining’s ( CIFR ) operations. Let's not forget that Bitcoin remains the lodestar for the crypto market. Therefore, identifying mining stocks with solid operational and financial footing now could provide an edge as the market heads into the next phase of the cycle. Every Bitcoin Miner has its strengths and weaknesses, as each miner takes a different approach to navigating the volatile crypto business. Cipher Mining's strategic timing in its hardware purchases and hosting capacity expansion made the stock one of the more appealing mining stocks to me, especially during the months leading up to the halving event. In that period, Cipher Mining's net assets also turned positive. This prompted my “buy” rating for the stock in December in an article titled: "" Cipher Mining’s Strategic Planning Will Pay Off ."" The stock is up an impressive 67% since that coverage. And one question is whether there is still fuel in the tank for CIFR? Cipher Mining’s Post-Halving Performance and Q3 Results Expectations As we already know, virtually every miner has seen decreased sales since the halving event. The increase in Bitcoin network difficulty has also raised the cost of mining per BTC, which has taken a toll on operating margins. For Q3, I don’t expect exceptional financial performance for Cipher Mining, beyond striving to maintain operations. Q3 months (July to September) are also typically peak electricity demand months on Electric Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”) electricity grids, where Cipher Mining gets the majority of its electricity power. To balance demand on the grid, a utility strategy called the four coincident peak program (“4CP”) is employed. During these 4CP periods, companies face increased electricity rates. For miners, it becomes important to limit energy consumption during these peak periods to save costs and potentially earn incentives. Based on the factors mentioned above, Cipher Mining will see a sequential decline in total mined BTC in Q3. In Q2, Cipher Mining mined 296 BTC in April, 166 BTC in May, and 176 BTC in June, bringing the total mined BTC to 635 BTC and Q2 total revenue to $36.81 million. 100% of Cipher Mining's revenue currently comes from its BTC mining operations. Though the miner has announced plans to diversify into high-performance computing (“HPC”) services, that hasn't taken off properly yet. For Q3, consensus expects a sequential decrease of 21% in Cipher Mining’s revenue, which will result in $28.81 million in revenue. Analysts expect a loss of $0.07 earnings per share. Using the current total shares outstanding for CIFR at 335.27 million shares with the projected EPS loss, this means Cipher Mining is expected to post a net loss of around $23 million. These estimates and anticipated drop in key financial metrics are well within the context of the reduced operational activity miners experience during 4CP periods in Texas. I, however, expect a slightly higher revenue from that of consensus estimates for Q3 because according to monthly production updates, Cipher Mining mined a total of 493 BTC in Q3. In the July , August , and September operations updates, Cipher Mining produced 178 BTC, 160 BTC, and 155 BTC respectively. I have applied the FASB accounting rule, which most miners have adopted, to the dollar value calculation of Cipher Mining's 493 produced BTC in Q3, where I’d use the monthly closing price of BTC as a fair value estimation for each month’s production. July’s closing price was $64,619. In August, BTC closed at $58,969, while in September, the monthly close was $63,329. This brings the fair value for Bitcoin mined in July to $11.5 million, that of August will be $9.44 million, and September production will be worth $9.82 million. The total dollar value of Bitcoin produced in Q3 based on using the monthly closing price as the fair value price will be $30.76 million. I believe the announced sales result for Q3 will be slightly above the consensus estimates of $28.81 million. Beating consensus estimates will bode well for CIFR as Bitcoin is now trading above $70,000 again, sparking a bull market sentiment. Data by YCharts I think Q3 will see QoQ drop in margins due to the higher cost to mine due to increase In electricity cost in 4CP periods and the increase in the Bitcoin network difficulty. Network difficulty is currently at an all-time high. Cipher Mining's 13.5 EH/s mining capacity EoY target remains feasible. Capacity has increased from 8.7 EH/s at the end of Q2, to 9.3 EH/s as of the September operations update. I believe Cipher Mining is on the path to achieving its 13.5 EH/s hashrate target because of the latest acquisition of the 300-MW Barber Lake site in West Texas, bringing total energy capacity to around 2.5 GW. There will be a drop in Cipher Mining’s asset base as less BTC were mined QoQ in Q3, and Cipher also sold $67.5 million worth of its BTC holding to fund the acquisition of the 300-MW Barber Lake site. About 923 BTC were sold in September, bringing the number of total BTC held to ~1,512 BTC as of the end of September. That would be a 33.4% QoQ drop in BTC held. Despite this drop, ~1512 BTC (around $107 million at today's BTC price) is still enough ongoing dry powder for Cipher. While the drop could raise some short-term liquidity concern if the price of Bitcoin drops further, I think Cipher Mining’s “hold-some, sell-some” approach to its produced and held Bitcoin remains prudent. I believe it helps the team swiftly undertake acquisitions they feel will be accretive without always embarking on ATM offerings, thereby severely diluting shares. This approach provides a balanced mix where the company can effectively manage cash flow and operational needs while still benefiting from BTC’s potential future price appreciation. Data by YCharts The massive jump in outstanding shares we saw in Q2 has not been repeated in Q3. So far in Q4, no additional shares have not been issued yet. However, it's important to keep an eye on the amount paid in stock-based compensations in the upcoming Q3 earnings result, as this could be dilutive too, affecting EPS. Stock-based compensation in Q2 was $13.3 million. If this increases in Q3, it could mean further dilution of shareholder value, and doesn’t bode well for investors. Risks As reiterated in coverage of Bitcoin-exposed stocks on Seeking Alpha, these stocks are tied to Bitcoin’s price movement and market sentiment; therefore, they exhibit a higher volatility just like their anchor asset. As Cipher Mining’s Bitcoin stash has shrunk following the sell-off for the 300-MW facility acquisition, and amidst reduced MoM Bitcoin production , Cipher Mining’s short-term liquidity prowess now leans more on a surge in Bitcoin's price. If BTC fails to impress, there is every likelihood that raising funds through equity issuance would recur, as mining companies face intense costs and typically have shorter cash runways. Takeaway While Q3 is expected to see a decline in revenue and production due to increased mining and electricity costs, CIFR’s latest strategies, like that of the Barber Lake acquisition, positions the miner well for future growth. The company's prudent ""hold-some, sell-some"" strategy with its Bitcoin holdings provides a buffer for short-term liquidity, but investors should remain vigilant about potential dilution from stock-based compensation. Ultimately, the direction of Bitcoin's price will be pivotal to the success of mining stocks, and identifying well-positioned mining stocks like CIFR, and taking long positions, would benefit investors as the Bitcoin market enters the anticipated bull season.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4730374-cipher-mining-a-bottom-up-analysis-q3-earnings-outlook?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35284441.jpeg

Analyst Ali Martinez has pinpointed this region as the critical threshold that Ethereum will cross before it makes its next significant move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Potential For Monetary Policy Sparks Growing Interest Among Central Banks If this support is sustained, according to Martinez, it shall serve as the catalyst in staging a rally to usher the cryptocurrency to the ambitious target of $6,000. However, things do not seem that smooth ahead as already some market observers and participants have opined that the existing support could break under pressure. #Ethereum is testing a key support zone at $2,400. If this level holds, we might see $ETH aiming for the channel’s upper boundary near $6,000! pic.twitter.com/W8J8WVy5CL — Ali (@ali_charts) October 26, 2024 Ethereum has begun forming a rising channel from July 2023. An ascending channel is a technical pattern in which two parallel trend lines represent the support and resistance level. Recently, the price of Ethereum stayed near the lower edge of this corridor. Martinez believes that Ethereum will rally from here, so everyone’s holding on tight. Important Support And Resistance Zones The ascending channel pattern does not occur by accident. It indicates the probable paths of Ethereum. The trend line acts as a resistance level in the channel, while the trend line at the bottom actually acts as a support level for the price to bounce. The move of Ethereum past $2,600 is also an important retest point that will act as a pivot for its new price target. Martinez believes this is a good risk-reward opportunity for the investor and recommends placing stops at around $2,00 to $2,150. The idea behind these stop-losses is to limit the potential losses, but they also open up upside in case Ethereum moves higher towards the upper trendline. This observation appears somewhat vague, as some analysts are expressing concerns about a potential breakdown at the $2,500 range. However, Martinez has not provided much insight into how this situation could still create favorable conditions for a rally to occur. Indicators Look Positive: On-Chain Data On-chain data shows 70% of Ethereum holders are profitable. Therefore, this positive attitude would be further supported in terms of the level of profitability that reduces the chances of big sellers. When there aren’t strong motives for selling, then an upward movement for Ethereum could easily be expected. Related Reading: Floki Inu Warning: Analyst Says ‘Prepare For The Crash’ – Details Robust Long-Term Projections Meanwhile, the future estimates for Ethereum have room for growth. The current market predictions reveal that Ethereum is trading about 6.5% lower than the predicted target for next month, which also means the asset is underpriced. More positive projections for the long term range from 173% possible returns in a year, according to figures by CoinCheckup. Such growth could probably give a push to Ethereum’s upward movement and form a firmer support base that may encourage price levels to stay high and stabilized.

42373487,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmWvb,1730208600,Privacy as a Fundamental Human Right,"What role do privacy tools play in crypto, and how does this discussion develop? Those were some of the questions at a panel I moderated last week at the DC Privacy Summit.  PS: I'll be in Dubai for Binance Blockchain Week on Wednesday and Thursday. Let's catch up if you're also there.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Tornado Cash  The narrative  Last week, I moderated a panel at the DC Privacy Summit, hosted by Project Glitch and the Coinbase Institute, on what comes next in the ongoing discussions about privacy and crypto – through, naturally, the lens of Tornado Cash and the Department of Justice's case against developer Roman Storm. I want to share some of the thoughts the panelists – DeFi Education Fund's Miller Whitehouse-Levine, a16z Crypto's Michele Korver, House Financial Services Committee's Allison Behuniak and Starkware's Katherine Kirkpatrick Bos – discussed during the 30 minute session.  Why it matters  Roman Storm's case is still winding its way through the U.S. legal system. A trial is scheduled for sometime in December. However it resolves, there's still a broader question about the role Tornado and similar services play in cryptocurrency.  Breaking it down  Privacy – at least in a crypto context – has a fairly negative connotation at the moment. The U.S. Treasury Department previously moved to consider whether it should classify mixers – tools which are designed to obfuscate the trail of crypto transactions – as a ""primary money laundering concern"" due to their role in laundering and terrorist financing. Tornado Cash's most famous user is the Lazarus Group, a North Korean government hacking group.  This negative connotation needs to be acknowledged and discussed, said Kirkpatrick Bos, the chief legal officer at Starkware, during last week's panel. Advocates for privacy tools also need to acknowledge that some of the arguments in favor of privacy tools – purchasing legal goods or services without people knowing about them, for example – may not be persuasive when stacked up against criminal activity.  Whitehouse-Levine, the CEO of the DeFi Education Fund, said that the most concerning aspect about the Tornado Cash debate is that it's playing out in court, rather than in Congress or through a regulatory agency's rulemaking authority.  ""I think [it's] a bad way to go about policy making, regardless of whether one is supportive of that policy or not,"" he said.  Behuniak, the staff director for a House subcommittee, said it could take ""dozens of round tables"" with lawmakers before they're comfortable holding a more formal hearing on an issue like the role of mixers and privacy tools in crypto.  An increasing number of lawmakers are willing to have a discussion about the benefit of mixers and what tradeoffs may be involved, she said, ""but it will take time.""  ""But at a small scale, I think we have made some progress in expanding the number of members [of Congress] that care about this issue,"" she said.  On the industry side of this issue, companies need to have some certainty about what exactly regulators are thinking and what prosecutors are alleging, said Korver, a16z Crypto's head of Regulatory.  ""Businesses need to have certainty whether they have obligations to do X or Y, and whether they can be held criminally responsible for it,"" she said. ""There's a difference between getting that wrong, interpreting the guidance wrong for your business model, and having a conversation with regulators where they may be convinced – or if they aren't, that you may get a really painful fine, [versus] actually taking away somebody's liberty and charging them criminally.""  In Storm's case, there's now an open question of how exactly Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidance about money transmitters applies. Attorneys have argued that the DOJ's charges against Storm would seem to go against this guidance.  This is playing out in the broader market structure debate in Congress, Behuniak said.  ""Certainly absent legislation, if the SEC continues to pull in certain intermediaries, that doesn't just come with SEC obligations, that also comes with Bank Secrecy Act obligations,"" she said. ""I think when it is determined what intermediaries should be captured, and then what exactly those requirements should be, I do think that conversation will receive more attention than it has.""  Whatever legislation may happen – market structure or stablecoin legislation or something else entirely – may not solve all of the problems at issue but should still mark progress, Kirkpatrick Bos said.  Humans generally do want some form of privacy, Whitehouse-Levine said. People don't want others to read their journals, homes have blinds and so on: ""That's why I think it's a fundamental human right.""

Tether CEO Ardoino Says He Expects U.S. Will Catch Up in Crypto Regulation: Tether's chief executive, Paolo Ardoino, spoke virtually at a few U.S. events last week, including DC Fintech Week. The speaking engagements come after Tether hired a U.S. lobbyist.

Ardoino later tweeted that there was ""no indication"" of an investigation.  Ripple Co-Founder Larsen Flooding Kamala Harris' Election Effort With XRP: Chris Larsen, Ripple's co-founder and executive chairman, donated $11 million in XRP to Future Forward, a political action committee supporting Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.  This week  Wednesday  19:00 UTC (3:00 p.m. EDT) Former FTX Director of Engineering Nishad Singh will be sentenced for his guilty pleas on charges of conspiring to commit wire fraud and fraud, conspiring to commit money laundering and conspiring to violate campaign finance laws (important to note that this hearing was originally scheduled for 3:30 p.m. EDT) but was moved up half an hour last Friday). Singh's attorneys are asking for no prison time. The Department of Justice did not recommend a specific sentence – similarly to its filing about former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison – but said he provided ""substantial assistance"" to prosecutors.

A Fairshake spokesperson told CoinDesk he'd look into the matter when asked for comment. A Stand With Crypto executive did not respond to a request for comment.  (Politico) Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick is running Donald Trump's transition team, and is taking heat from other Trump allies over allegations that he's discussing his business – including issues related to Tether, a Cantor client – during meetings about transition duties. Lutnick spoke at Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden on Sunday night, taking the stage after a number of speakers who made racist remarks about different groups in the U.S., as well as derogatory comments about Vice President Kamala Harris.

The service is offered through the global Binance.com platform meaning there are restrictions for some jurisdictions, such as the U.S.  Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has unveiled Binance Wealth, a white glove service that allows private client managers to easily onboard high-net-worth individuals and offer them a wide range of digital assets.  Wealth managers will handle the onboarding of clients by submitting know-your-customer (KYC) documentation and creating individual sub-accounts on Binance for each client, allowing them to trade or stake a wide range of cryptos with the feel of traditional wealth management framework, exchange said on Tuesday. Support from Binance VIP key account client managers is also available.  Crypto assets are widely accepted as portfolio diversification spice among institutional investors with the arrival of bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year, which had probably meant further validation for the asset class among high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs).  Despite appearances, Binance Wealth is not a financial advisory service but a technological solution designed to meet the needs of wealth managers, with the necessary infrastructure allowing them to oversee and support their clients’ exposure to crypto, explained Catherine Chen, head of Binance VIP & Institutional, in an email.  The service is offered through the global Binance.com platform meaning there are restrictions for some jurisdictions; Binance Wealth will not be available in the U.S., for instance. The initial focus will be on Asia and Latin America, according to a Binance spokesperson.  “Wealth managers can help onboard and support their clients who are eligible to use Binance.com – residing in jurisdictions where Binance.com is available,” Chen said. “This of course is still subject to who the wealth managers can service in the first place, based on their respective license/exemption.”  In terms of custody, the assets belonging to each end-client are held in the clients’ own allocated sub-account.  “The client will retain full control of their assets which are held in the respective wallets under their account on the Binance platform. User assets are viewable in our Proof of Reserves page,” a Binance spokesperson said.  The VIP wealth offering will not come with cheaper fees, like the exchange’s prime broker Link service, which was designed for enterprises.  “Standard trading fees apply. Binance offers a highly-competitive fee structure, and users who qualify for our VIP Program receive attractive fee discounts,” Chen said.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/29/binance-unveils-binance-wealth-for-elite-customers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bb493ad5430f73912182503114c7ab3aceba601-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35283512,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650555,1730206968,PrimeXBT: What does the rest of the trading year have in store for Cryptocurrency?,"PrimeXBT: What does the rest of the trading year have in store for Cryptocurrency? By Matthew Hayward, Senior Market Analyst at PrimeXBT Traditionally, the fourth quarter and October have been strong months for cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. However, this year, the gains have been less impressive than in previous years. Currently, Bitcoin has increased by over 5% this month, providing a glimmer of optimism. So, what has caused this underwhelming performance, and why haven’t we seen the expected rally? Reflecting on early October, a series of announcements and shifts in the economic landscape contributed to Bitcoin’s initial decline, setting a challenging tone for the month. Analysing the infographic below shows that, during a “bull market,” the fourth quarter has historically been a period of significant growth for Bitcoin. With just two months left in the quarter, will Bitcoin maintain its upward momentum? Source: Crypto Rover Current price movements influenced by political uncertainty Several key events demand attention from both political and economic perspectives. On the political front, the upcoming U.S. elections are in focus, with recent polls indicating a surge in Trump’s popularity. While the final results remain uncertain until election day, past trends show that Trump’s campaigns have often driven positive momentum in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. He has also voiced support for advancing cryptocurrency adoption if re-elected, sparking questions about whether this could drive broader acceptance in the sector. Looking more closely at the infographic below, we can see that the timing of Bitcoin cycles alongside U.S. election cycles has generally resulted in a net positive impact on Bitcoin’s price following elections. Source: Crypto Rover Ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic landscape In September, the Federal Reserve made a significant move by reducing interest rates by 0.5%, marking a substantial shift after an extended period of stability. This bold rate cut takes us back to the last major interest rate cut, where the FED also cut interest rates by 0.5%, which took place right before the stock market crash that triggered the 2008 financial crisis. Source: Reuters Following the announcement of the interest rate decision, Non-Farm Payroll data came in significantly higher than expected, contrasting with previous reports. The Federal Reserve had previously emphasised its intent to support the labour market, and as the elections approach, it appears to be succeeding. However, the question remains: how substantial will next year’s revisions be if these results are indeed inflated? Could inflation continue to rise in the future? In the light of the Federal Reserve’s 0.5% interest rate reduction and unexpectedly strong job reports, attention has turned to inflation concerns. The Fed reiterates lowering inflation to its 2% target; however, traders are now concerned about the potential risk of inflation increasing following the rate cut. Recent CPI figures showed a slight uptick, landing at 2.4%, just below the previous month’s rate of 2.5%. Should inflation continue to rise while U.S. GDP data remains stagnant or decreases, the economy could face the threat of “stagflation.” Source: Reuters Could an economic downturn be looming ahead? Historically, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have yet to face a prolonged period of major economic uncertainty. Since Bitcoin’s launch in the late 2000s, it has existed solely in the post-2008 financial crisis environment. This brings up an important question: how might the risk of a potential “Black Swan” event impact its price trends and disrupt established cycle theories? Source: Seekingalpha What impact do these developments have on cryptocurrencies and the broader markets? As cryptocurrency adoption increases and more institutional investors enter the market, traditional indicators are likely to have a greater influence on trading strategies for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The two charts below illustrate how the markets are anticipating these data releases and their impact on Bitcoin’s price movements. Notably, prior to the interest rate cut, the price of Bitcoin began to rise sharply. This is because, in an environment of interest rate cuts, risk assets like cryptocurrencies typically perform better. The charts demonstrate how this positive sentiment was already reflected in the pricing, leading to an upward movement following the announcement. In the second scenario, we can see that the latest CPI data release was not favourable for the pricing of risk assets, as uncertainty grew regarding the possibility of rising inflation. If inflation were to start increasing, the chart below illustrates how the market was already pricing in a negative reaction to that data release.

Market reaction to the change has been mixed to negative, with some raising concern about the freeze functionality with USDS. Sentiment aside, the DAI stablecoin is still one of the most widely utilized stablecoin in the industry and MKR trades at an attractive multiple. Calling the last seven months “brutal” for holders of the MakerDAO ( MKR-USD ) governance token would likely be an understatement. Since April, MKR has collapsed nearly 80% with very few green candles along the way. MKR Daily Chart (TrendSpider) It’s been ugly. Despite the hideousness of the MKR chart, the coin itself still represents supposed governance over the MakerDAO protocol. A system that is ranked 15th in fees, 4th in TVL, and is the issuer of two of the top six stablecoins in the market by circulating supply. In past articles for Seeking Alpha, I’ve called MKR a ' sell ' and a ' hold '. In this update, I’ll detail why I now believe MKR is an interesting speculative 'buy.' Why The Freefall? During the summer, MakerDAO was re-branded to Sky Protocol and two new tokens were introduced. The Sky ( SKY-USD ) token was launched as a governance counterpart to MKR and is redeemable on a 24,000 to 1 ratio; 1 MKR token being equal to 24,000 SKY tokens. The re-brand also brings about a new stablecoin counterpart to DAI ( DAI-USD ) via the Sky Dollar (USDS-USD). Like DAI, Sky Dollar has a soft-peg to USD and derives value backing from a basket of assets that include crypto, real world assets (or RWA), and other stablecoins. Importantly, nothing changes with DAI or MKR as a result of this update and conversion to the new tokens is not mandatory. The reception to USDS within the cryptocurrency community has been mixed to negative, from my vantage. One of the primary concerns from community members has been the inclusion of 'freeze functionality' in the code for USDS. This is a drastic change from DAI. The only stablecoins in the market with a larger circulating supply than DAI are Tether ( USDT-USD ) and USD Coin ( USDC-USD ); each of which have the same freeze functionality as USDS. The purpose for such a mechanism is for compliance with regulators when funds are marked as being used for illicit activities. Thus, this appears to be an attempt to make Maker/Sky better positioned for broad adoption. There are some who welcome this, but the more hardcore DeFi participants are less convinced. Given the reception to the new direction, MakerDAO is now reportedly contemplating dropping the Sky Protocol brand all together and will put it to a community governance vote in early-November. Options to be considered include continuing forward with Sky, dropping Sky and reinstating MKR as the sole governance token, or bringing back the ""Maker"" brand in another capacity. Frankly, it's all a bit chaotic in my personal opinion and shows how community governance in the public blockchain space can be messy. However, I also think the market has taken SKY - and by extension MKR - too far down. Thus, a potential opportunity for contrarian buyers. Circulating Supply and Usage Since the launch of Sky Dollar, USDS has become the sixth largest stablecoin in the market by circulating supply at just over $1 billion. Rank Stablecoin Ticker Supply 1 Tether USDT $120,298 2 USD Coin USDC $34,379 3 Dai DAI $4,914 4 Ethena USDe USDe $2,623 5 First Digital USD FDUSD $2,306 6 Sky Dollar USDS $1,013 7 USDD USDD $760.6 8 PayPal USD PYUSD $629.6 9 BlackRock USD BUIDL $529.7 10 TrueUSD TUSD $484.4 Source: DeFiLlama, dollars in millions Interestingly, 729 million of those 1 billion USDS coins are DAI tokens that have been 'upgraded' to the new stablecoin through convertibility. Of the combined supply between USDS and DAI, the circulating stablecoins are over-collateralized, with $9.7 billion in total collateral against less than $6 billion in currency supply. Monthly network fee growth has declined in recent months, but is still well ahead of levels from the previous bull cycle: Fees vs Stablecoin Transfer Volume (Token Terminal) The chart above shows $16.6 million in Sky/Maker fees for the month of September. This is admittedly about 50% off the 2024 high from April but still well ahead of the $10.3 million in fees during September 2023. There are ebbs and flows with every blockchain-based product, but I think we're seeing stablecoins starting to carve out a more significant role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Consider the $962 billion in transferred value in the chart above. Despite the proliferation of new stablecoins from centralized issuers like BlackRock ( BLK ) or PayPal ( PYPL ), DAI has been used more in 2024 than any other year since it was launched, and this is not something that is widespread in the stablecoin market. Transfer Data And Annualized Revenue As mentioned above, August produced $962 billion in transferred value for the DAI stablecoin. The chart below shows on-chain volume for DAI in a stacked chart with the other popular stables like Tether and USDC. It can be hard to see the legend if you don't click to enlarge, but DAI is the yellow bars below: Monthly Stablecoin Transfer Volume (IntoTheBlock) In March, DAI made up 25% of the stablecoin volume. In every single month since April, DAI has been the most used stablecoin in the EVM space. It was 65% of the market in August and 52% in September. It isn't just the number 1 stable in this regard, but it is accounting for more transfer volume than all of the other coins combined. How does this benefit MKR holders? Annualized Revenue (Sky.money) MKR holders get a take rate on platform fees. Keep in mind that even though it's not a fiat-backed stable, DAI is collateralized by t-bills and real world assets. At $304.3 million, the annualized revenue trend has normalized since the big spike in the DAI Savings Rate (or DSR) earlier this year. But despite the DSR coming back down to January/February levels, the annualized revenue has grown . So if we construct a price to sales multiple that adds both the $92.5 million market cap of SKY tokens with the $990 million market cap of MKR tokens, we get a price to sales multiple of about 3.5. Essentially, MKR is trading at a cheaper P/S valuation than BlackRock - which has issued a far less successful stablecoin in its own right. Closing Summary There are a number of different reasons why digital asset investors may want to allocate a position to any coin or token. In the instance of MKR, the coin has been clearly suffering from bad PR. Things get interesting as potential contrarian plays when sentiment gets worse than the fundamental setup. I think we now have that with MKR. The price of the MKR token has been getting hit in line with the SKY token due to the convertibility between the two. The market doesn't seem to like SKY. But I believe that provides an opportunity for patient investors. The risk to this theory is that the MakerDAO ecosystem is in disarray and the market is pricing in future failure of either governance or the protocol itself. I don't think that's the most likely outcome. So I think MKR is a solid bet after such a large selloff in such a short amount of time.",NEGATIVE,MKR | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MKR | DAI,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4730349-sky-falling-mr-market-hates-makerdao-re-brand?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35283450.jpeg

BTC broke through the $70,000 barrier for the first time since June on Monday, prompting $48 billion in trading volume and over $143 million in shorts being liquidated across the crypto market. Bitcoin is around 4% higher in the last 24 hours, while the broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, is up by over 3.2%. DOGE led the gains, jumping over 14% to around $0.165, while ETH rose above $2,600 on the back of a 3.9% rise.  DOGE futures interest is nearing record levels, thanks to increasing confidence of Donald Trump winning next week's presidential election. Traders view DOGE as an election play thanks to Elon Musk's endorsement of the Republican candidate, and by extension the possibility of Musk running a ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" abbreviated as D.O.G.E. DOGE-denominated futures have risen 33% since Sunday to 8 billion tokens as of European morning hours Tuesday. “Elon is memeing the idea of a 'Department of Government Efficiency' into reality and is able to tie it to DOGE somehow,” influential X account @theunipcs told CoinDesk. A Trump victory next week would bring ""an even more parabolic move in dogecoin,"" @theunipcs added.  Trading on Crypto.com has exploded this year, pushing the crypto exchange’s volumes in North America ahead of Coinbase. Crypto.com’s monthly spot trading volume soared to $134 billion in September from $34 billion in July, according to data from The Block. Overall trading volumes on North American crypto exchanges was $183 billion in September, in which Coinbase handled $46 billion. Kraken, the third-largest exchange, was way behind in October with just under $10 billion in trading activity. A key reason for its popularity could be the wide range of tokens on offer. Crypto.com lists over 378, compared to Coinbase and Kraken which offer fewer than 290 tokens each.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows Donald Trump's chances of victory in next week's presidential election, as per Polymarket, against the U.S. dollar index.  The possibility of higher tariffs imposed by a Trump presidency is seen as unfavorable for emerging markets, with capital flows favoring the dollar and leading to a short-term increase in USD's value.  ""With Trump's stance on imposing high tariffs, enacting tax cuts, and expanding fiscal spending, inflation is likely to increase,"" MacroMicro added ""This could lead to a higher volume of bond issuance, driving up Treasury yields.""

35281937,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650386,1730203257,Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash ‘Buy’ Signal: Analysts See New Highs On The Horizon,"Bitcoin (BTC) has recently shown renewed strength in its market stance, with positive signals emerging from key market indicators. This emerging positivity in BTC’s market indicators comes on the heels of the asset seeing a gradual recovery in price over the past weeks. Earlier today, BTC again came closer to the $70,000 mark with a 24 hour high of $69,217. However, the asset has since retraced with a current trading price of $68,644, up 1.6% in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Positions Face Serious Risk Above $68,500 – Details Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash Buy Signal According to an analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the “Hash Ribbons” indicator has flashed a buy signal, historically aligning with strong long-term performance for BTC. This signal follows an earlier occurrence during the summer, indicating strong prospects for Bitcoin’s growth. The Hash Ribbons indicator tracks shifts in Bitcoin’s hash rate, an important metric that reflects the overall health of the mining ecosystem. As Darkfost explains, this indicator has consistently proven accurate in predicting Bitcoin price rallies, with only one notable exception during the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a unique market disruption. By analyzing Hash Ribbons chart, Darkfost noted: “This suggests that another BTC rally could potentially occur over the middle-term.” Miners’ Position Signals Market Optimism Adding to the bullish outlook, another analyst, Avocado onchain, has pointed out a notable trend in miners’ behavior, which may also contribute to an optimistic price outlook for BTC. Miners play a critical role in Bitcoin’s cyclical market patterns, often influencing price volatility with their buying and selling actions. According to Avocado, miners tend to hold onto their Bitcoin rather than sell during periods of price stagnation, which can create favorable conditions for a price surge when demand picks up. Miners Are Betting on a Bitcoin Price Rise “Historically, when the MPI rebounded from a low, #Bitcoin’s price tended to experience significant increases.” – By @avocado_onchain Read more 👇https://t.co/aa9bcHN9XJ pic.twitter.com/8PsOQdBMEl — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 28, 2024 The Miner Position Index (MPI) shows that miners still hold onto their Bitcoin with minimal movement toward exchanges, indicating limited selling pressure from these influential market participants. Historically, a rebound in the MPI has been associated with Bitcoin price increases, suggesting miners are holding onto assets in anticipation of higher prices.

35281727,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24393,1730201329,Bitfinex Alpha | Biến Động Đang Đến,"Tải Full Alpha Bitcoin đang dậy sóng với sự kết hợp bùng nổ của bất ổn địa chính trị, các yếu tố kinh tế vĩ mô và câu chuyện “Trump trade” ngày càng nóng. Tuần trước, BTC đã có một cú điều chỉnh “sốc tận óc” tới 6,2% trước khi phục hồi. Điều này cho thấy ảnh hưởng ngày càng lớn của cuộc bầu cử tổng thống Mỹ sắp tới lên giá cả, với chiến thắng của Đảng Cộng hòa được coi là cú hích cho các tài sản rủi ro như Bitcoin. Mối tương quan giữa tỷ lệ cược bầu cử của Trump và đà tăng của Bitcoin đang ngày càng rõ nét. Sự mong đợi xung quanh cuộc bầu cử đã thúc đẩy hoạt động quyền chọn “bùng nổ. Các quyền chọn đáo hạn vào các ngày quan trọng quanh cuộc bầu cử đang có phí bảo hiểm cao hơn, với mức biến động ngầm dự kiến ​​sẽ đạt đỉnh 100 vol hàng ngày vào ngày 8 tháng 11, ngay sau Ngày Bầu cử – cho thấy thị trường đang chuẩn bị cho những biến động tiềm ẩn. Bất kể kết quả bầu cử ra sao, biến động ngắn hạn dự kiến ​​sẽ cao hơn bình thường, mặc dù chúng tôi vẫn tin tưởng vào sự tăng giá dài hạn. Bất chấp những lần điều chỉnh gần đây, Bitcoin đã cho thấy khả năng phục hồi phi thường kể từ khi giảm xuống $52,756 vào tháng 9, tăng 30% trong suốt tháng 10. Xu hướng mùa cũng đang ủng hộ Bitcoin : Quý 4 luôn là quý tăng giá trong những năm halving, với lợi nhuận trung bình hàng quý là 31,34%. Hiệu ứng thời vụ mạnh mẽ này, kết hợp với mức lãi suất mở kỷ lục trong các quyền chọn và hợp đồng tương lai Bitcoin, nhấn mạnh sự lạc quan của những người tham gia thị trường khi bước vào giai đoạn cuối năm. Hỗ trợ cho sự lạc quan này là sự gia tăng đều đặn trong các quyền chọn mua cho ngày đáo hạn 27 tháng 12, đặc biệt tập trung vào mức giá $80,000. Khi khối lượng mở quyền chọn leo lên mức cao mới, thị trường đang cho thấy dấu hiệu của việc định vị cho một đợt tăng giá sau bầu cử, có khả năng đẩy Bitcoin hướng tới—và vượt qua—mức cao nhất mọi thời đại là $73,666. Tóm lại, bất ổn bầu cử, câu chuyện “Trump trade” và tính thời vụ thuận lợi của Quý 4 tạo ra một cơn bão hoàn hảo cho Bitcoin, hứa hẹn một giai đoạn thú vị phía trước bất kể những biến động giá ồn ào khi cuộc bầu cử diễn ra trong hai tuần tới. Trong nền kinh tế Mỹ nói chung, thị trường lao động đã chứng tỏ khả năng phục hồi bất chấp những gián đoạn tự nhiên và công nghiệp gần đây. Các đơn xin trợ cấp thất nghiệp lần đầu giảm xuống 227.000 vào tuần trước, bất chấp những thách thức do cơn bão Milton và cuộc đình công kéo dài tại nhà sản xuất máy bay Boeing. Điều quan trọng là việc sa thải liên quan đến bão ở Florida đã được bù đắp bởi sự sụt giảm trong các đơn xin trợ cấp thất nghiệp ở các bang khác, làm nổi bật một môi trường lao động mạnh mẽ bên ngoài các khu vực bị ảnh hưởng. Sách Beige của Cục Dự trữ Liên bang cũng mô tả việc làm là “ ổn định ”, với số lượng sa thải tối thiểu được báo cáo trên nhiều lĩnh vực khác nhau. Trong lĩnh vực nhà ở, thị trường Mỹ hiện đang trải qua sự phân hóa . Doanh số bán nhà mới tăng vọt vào tháng 9, nhờ lãi suất thế chấp giảm tạm thời. Ngược lại, doanh số bán nhà hiện tại giảm mạnh xuống mức thấp nhất kể từ năm 2010, phần lớn là do “hiệu ứng khóa chặt”, trong đó những chủ nhà có thế chấp lãi suất thấp không muốn bán và phải đối mặt với lãi suất cao hơn khi mua mới. Khả năng chi trả vẫn là một rào cản lớn đối với nhiều người mua nhà lần đầu khi giá tiếp tục duy trì ở mức cao. Mặc dù việc giảm lãi suất gần đây đã kích thích doanh số bán nhà mới, nhưng sự phục hồi bền vững trên thị trường nhà ở sẽ phụ thuộc vào việc ổn định lãi suất thế chấp trên diện rộng hoặc sự can thiệp tiềm năng từ Cục Dự trữ Liên bang. Khoản đầu tư gần đây của Đại học Emory vào tài sản kỹ thuật số đánh dấu một bước chuyển dịch sang việc áp dụng tiền điện tử theo mô hình tổ chức . Trường đại học đã tiết lộ việc nắm giữ Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust và cổ phiếu Coinbase, với tổng trị giá khoảng 15,9 triệu USD, báo hiệu sự chấp nhận tài sản kỹ thuật số đang nổi lên trong số các tổ chức truyền thống. Cuộc họp cổ đông sắp tới của Microsoft sẽ bỏ phiếu về đề xuất khám phá Bitcoin như một tài sản kho bạc. Mặc dù hội đồng quản trị phản đối đề xuất này, với lý do lo ngại về biến động và quy định, nhưng ngay cả một khoản phân bổ nhỏ từ 76 tỷ USD dự trữ tiền mặt của Microsoft cũng sẽ có tác động sâu sắc đến việc hợp pháp hóa BTC như một tài sản của công ty.

42373488,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmX0r,1730199312,Here Are 3 Reasons Why Bitcoin Open Interest Set Record Highs as BTC Price Surge to $71K,"Bitcoin futures' open interest on a one-day basis saw the biggest jump in 24 hours since June, an increase of over 20,000 BTC.  Since Oct. 16, U.S listed spot ETFs have seen $2.7 billion of net inflows.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}-tracked futures set a record high open interest (OI) in U.S. dollar terms early Tuesday as the asset broke past $71,000 for the first time since June, data shows.  BTC futures recorded their biggest one-day jump in OI since June 3. As of Tuesday, OI jumped to over 20,000 BTC, worth $2.5 billion at current prices, to reach almost 600,000 BTC, or $42.6 billion.  OI refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled. High open interest indicates that there is significant interest in a particular asset. When open interest increases along with rising prices, it suggests new money is coming into the market, indicating a strengthening trend - such as Tuesday’s.  High open interest can lead to increased volatility, especially as contracts near expiration. Traders might rush to close, roll over, or adjust positions, which can lead to significant price movements. Research firm Kaiko said in an X post that while futures showed strong interest from traders, the funding rates for such positions remain well below March highs which indicate tempered demand.  Funding rates in perpetual futures markets are periodic payments made between traders to ensure that the price of the perpetual contract remains close to the spot price of the underlying asset. Traders such as Singapore-based QCP Capital remain bullish on BTC in the near term, expecting price gains to continue in the weeks ahead.  “With rising expectations around a potential Trump victory boosting both stocks and Bitcoin, we believe BTC is well-positioned for medium-term gains,” the firm wrote in a Tuesday broadcast on Telegram.  Reasons why BTC OI has zoomed  Contracts offered on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have seen a 9% surge in 24 hours, taking their open interest to 171,700 BTC, worth over $12.22 billion, which gives CME a 30% dominance in the futures open interest market. As they maintain their number one spot in this market.  In mid-October, bitcoin was trading around $67,000 and the OI on CME hit all-time highs in both notional open interest ($12.4 billion) which is the dollar value of the futures contracts and bitcoin denominated futures contracts (179,930 BTC), per Glassnode data.  Second, the funding rate in perpetual markets has also soared in the past 24 hours to 15%, according to Coinglass data, this is one of the highest recorded levels in the past few months, which shows an extreme bias for bullish long trades.  Finally, the third reason can be attributed to the strong inflows from the U.S. listed spot ETFs, which in recent weeks has seen a slight evolution from the institutional basis trade at the start of the year to now more bullish long directional plays.  Since Oct. 16 bitcoin denominated futures contracts peaked on the CME exchange, it has since dropped by over 6%, which has been the opposite for the ETF inflows which have seen a cumulative net inflow of $2.7 billion. The charge has been led by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has seen $2.2 billion of net inflows in the same time period while achieving a new record of holding over 400,000 bitcoin in the ETF.  Earlier in the year it was apparent that the basis trade or the cash and carry arbitrage was taking place which involves taking advantage of the price difference between the bitcoin spot and futures price. The basis trade involves taking a long position on the ETF and then taking a short position on the CME futures bitcoin price. This was one of the reasons bitcoin has been trading in a long sideways range since March, as not all the inflows from the ETFs were directionally long but overall a net neutral strategy.  Checkmate, an analyst, also noted the recent divergence between the CME OI and the ETF inflows.  “We have a divergence between Bitcoin ETF Inflows and CME Open Interest. ETF Inflows are ticking meaningfully higher. CME Open Interest is up, but not as much. GBTC outflows are also minimal. We're seeing true directional ETF inflows, and less so cash and carry trades,” Checkmate wrote.  The recent purchase of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) by the Emory University endowment could support Checkmate's point of view to be a directional long purchase, as one would not expect a University to start executing the basis trade. Emory University would be the first endowment to purchase a bitcoin ETF and while $15 million isn’t a large sum for an institutional investor the narrative and the directional play stand out in a similar fashion to the Wisconsin Pension Fund.  However, Andre Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise, takes the other side of this view: he believes due to the increase in net short-positioning and an increase in CME open interest in the past 24 hours, that the basis trade has already started to pick up, he told CoinDesk in a note.  “There was an increase in net short positioning judging by the change in net non-commercial positioning on CME since early September. This coincided with an overall increase in CME open interest which implies that net there has really been an increase in cash-and-carry trades,"" he wrote in a note to CoinDesk. ""However, we only have weekly data up to 22/10 from the CFTC, so we don't have insights into the latest OI change yet”.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,"James Van Straten, Shaurya Malwa",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/29/heres-three-reasons-why-bitcoin-futures-set-record-highs-amid-price-surge-to-71k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/130f29ee3f8de9b6c6ffa066a914414940ef7f2e-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some market watchers noted the cryptocurrency’s potential, suggesting the levels to watch ahead of the next bullish rally. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Breaks Above Key Resistance ‘We Could See A 25% Rally’ – Top Analyst Neiro Sees 10% Weekly Correction Neiro made the headlines three months ago after becoming an overnight sensation on the Ethereum Network. The memecoin was inspired by the newly adopted sister of Dogecoin’s inspiration, Kabosu. The cryptocurrency has registered a remarkable performance during October, jumping 30% month-to-date (MTD). Moreover, the token saw an impressive rally towards its all-time high (ATH) price of $0.0022 two weeks ago, surging 4,600% in 30 days. The memecoin’s bullish momentum also propelled its market capitalization (MC) near the $1 billion mark, reaching a $935 million MC on October 15, which fueled a bullish sentiment among market watchers. However, Neiro’s price has declined since its most recent rally, trading 31.5% below its ATH. The Shiba Inu-themed memecoin registers a 10.3% drop in the past week, hovering between the $0.00132-$0.00170 price range. Despite the price drop, analysts and investors remain positive above the cryptocurrency. Crypto Tony noted that the memecoin is another token that looks “really good” since the beginning of its bullish momentum in mid-September. The analyst pointed out Neiro’s potential, suggesting that a small pullback from its recent levels could be a good entry point for investors ahead of an upcoming rally. Is $0.0020 Or $0.0010 Next? Since its all-time high, the cryptocurrency’s chart has displayed a downtrend, forming a broadening wedge pattern in the lower time frame, according to trader CryptoBull360. The market watcher noted that a successful breakout above the upper trendline could trigger a 25%-30% bullish rally for the token. Another trader suggested Neiro’s “situation on the chart is messy.” The trader stated that the token needed to break above the $0.00165 mark to continue its bullish trajectory and recover its ATH levels. However, if Neiro is rejected instead, the token could see a 30% correction toward the $0.0010 support zone. The $0.00165-$0.00170 price range represented an important consolidation zone ahead of the token’s surge toward its ATH. On Monday morning, Neiro’s price jumped 13.3% toward the $0.00170 resistance level. The token moved above the pattern’s upper trendline, signaling a breakout from its biweekly downtrend.

After “a longer manipulation” and reclaiming the $0.00150 level over the weekend, the analyst believes Neiro is ready to move toward higher resistance levels, potentially targeting the crucial $0.0020 mark again.

42373476,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmW51,1730195238,"As BIS Mulls Shutting Down mBridge, Its Innovation Hub Calls The Project a ‘Public Good’","An international payments project backed by China, the UAE, Thailand and Hong Kong is raising concerns in Washington.  mBridge uses decentralized ledger technology to make quicker payments that bypass intermediary banks.  The future of the Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS) involvement in mBridge was cast into doubt on Oct 28. following a report from Bloomberg that top bank officials and financial executives discussed the possibility of shutting mBridge down during a meeting in Washington.  The discussions, which took place last week, stemmed from concerns about comments made by Russian president Vladimir Putin during the opening of the BRICS Summit in Kazan, where he floated the idea of an alternative BRICS-led international payments system. Though Putin’s comments garnered a lukewarm response from fellow BRICS members, it has focused attention on projects like mBridge which are seeking to build alternatives to SWIFT.  Run by the central banks of China, Thailand, the UAE and Hong Kong — with Saudi Arabia joining this year as a new member — and backed by the BIS Innovation Hub, mBridge is a cross-border payments system that aims to make transferring money internationally quicker and cheaper.  It removes the need for correspondent banks, which act as intermediaries for payments between banks in different countries that don’t have formal relationships.  In June this year, it reached its minimum viable product (MVP) stage, with participating banks deploying consensus nodes and commercial banks conducting transactions. The platform currently supports key functions for participants including CBDC issuance and redemption, FX payment versus payment (PVP), CBDC transfers, queue management and balance alerts, and information management systems.  As of October 2024, the project had 32 observing members, including the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Bank of Korea FATF and the Banque Central du Luxembourg, according to the BIS Innovation Hub.  A total of 39 commercial banks from China, Thailand, the UAE, Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia are also participating in its MVP stage. Between April and September 2024, the platform facilitated payments and transactions in four CBDCs (e-CNY, e-THB, e-AED and e-HKD), with transactions conducted by 35 commercial banks.  To its proponents, mBridge is a potential solution for the major pain points that have long plagued traditional banking, particularly for underserved regions. It can allow countries to settle payments in their own currency instead of the more commonly used U.S. dollar and make transactions much quicker using distributed ledger technology.  Speaking at Hong Kong Fintech Week, Li Shu-Pui, Advisor to H.E. The Governor at the Central Bank of the U.A.E., said that in a test in February they sent money from a bank in Abu Dhabi to one in Beijing in just ten seconds.  “Middle Eastern, Central Asian, African countries and even South American countries are underserved [by traditional banking] because the correspondent banking network does not cover so many of these countries. Many of these countries are not served adequately so they're very excited about how they [can] make use of mBridge” he said.  BIS’s own literature available through its BIS Innovation Hub stand at Hong Kong Fintech Week calls mBridge “a public good” and claims it can “help foster financial inclusion”.  Countries like China have been taking steps to push for greater dedollarization of the global economy and the settlement of international payments in different currencies. During the BRICS summit, Putin claimed that nearly 95% of Russia-China trade is done in local currency.  But mBridge’s detractors are worried about the geopolitical risk the project poses. Policymakers in the U.S. and Europe have warned against having an international financial system underpinned by China-developed technology, as well as the risk of reduced ability to enforce U.S. and European economic sanctions.  In 2022, Yaya J. Fanusie, currently the Director of Policy for AML & Cyber Risk at the Crypto Council for Innovation, said that the announcement of the mBridge project should serve as a wakeup call to U.S. policymakers who wanted to maintain U.S. influence on the financial system. ""[mBridge] likely will be built upon not only by nations seeking more efficient payment infrastructure, as all central banks should, but also by U.S. adversaries strategizing for ways around U.S. geopolitical influence, like China,” he wrote.  The BIS did not respond to a request for comment and staff on the ground at Hong Kong Fintech Week said they could not discuss the matter.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Callan Quinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/29/as-bis-mulls-shutting-down-mbridge-its-innovation-hub-calls-the-project-a-public-good,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c44cc3d31cc4bf73f9760c3c42368a9843e2767-1104x621.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35277219,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650279,1730192420,Ethereum Bullish Signal: Whales Withdraw $750 Million In ETH From Exchanges,"On-chain data shows exchanges have recently observed a large amount of Ethereum exit their wallets, a sign that could be bullish for ETH’s value. Ethereum Exchange Reserve Has Seen A Plunge Recently As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the ETH investors have made net outflows from exchanges recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Exchange Reserve,” which keeps track of the total amount of Ethereum sitting on the wallets associated with all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, investors will make net inflows into these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons holders deposit their coins in exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this trend can have bearish implications for the asset’s price. Related Reading: “Time To Get Ready For Another Bull Run,” Bitcoin Analyst Says— Here’s Why On the other hand, the indicator registering a decline suggests a net amount of ETH is currently exiting the exchanges. Such a trend can indicate that the investors are accumulating, which can naturally prove to be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum Exchange Reserve over the last few weeks: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Exchange Reserve has registered a huge drop during the last few days, which implies that investors have made large net withdrawals. The holders have taken out more than 300,000 ETH from these platforms during the past week, which is worth almost $754 million at the current exchange rate. Given the massive scale involved here, it’s likely that the whale entities were behind the outflows. Also, considering that the withdrawals have come after ETH’s stumble from its $2,700 high earlier in the month, these humongous investors may have made them buy at the lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Not Over Yet? This Ratio Has Just Seen A Golden Cross Naturally, if this is true, Ethereum could benefit from a rebound from this plunge in the Exchange Reserve. The surge may also have begun, as ETH has now recovered above the $2,500 mark. In some other news, as market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has pointed out in an X post, the Ethereum Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio is sitting at 1.2 right now. The MVRV Ratio tells us how the value that Ethereum investors are currently holding compares against the amount that they initially put into the cryptocurrency. The latest value of 1.2 suggests the average ETH holder is currently holding a profit. From the chart, it’s apparent that the asset has historically encountered tops when the MVRV Ratio has been at notably higher values, so it’s possible that the current profitability isn’t high enough for ETH to top out. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at around $2,500, down 6% over the last seven days.

42373471,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmVej,1730192400,DeFi Cover Provider Nexus Mutual Backs New Crypto Insurance Broker Native,"Crypto specialist insurance broker Native goes live with $2.6 million of seed funding led by Nexus Mutual.  Native will start by offering $20 million on-chain cover per risk, and will also run a capital pool on Nexus Mutual.  Nexus Mutual’s insurance alternative is also available through many of the main protocols on Coinbase’s layer 2 network via a product called Base DeFi Pass.  Nexus Mutual, the decentralized alternative to traditional insurance geared towards risks involving digital assets, is widening its distribution capabilities by backing a dedicated crypto insurance broker called Native.  Native goes live with $2.6 million of seed funding led by Nexus Mutual, and the two firms are offering $20 million on-chain cover per risk, according to a press release on Tuesday. Nexus Mutual currently has a capital pool of about $200 million, mostly denominated in ETH, the token of the Ethereum blockchain, meaning the mutual will be able to write multiple coverage lines per risk from day one, Nexus Mutual said.  There has always been a dire shortage of insurance capacity within the crypto industry. At a rough estimate, about 1% of crypto assets are insured today, compared with the traditional world where a general rule of thumb is that about 7% of GDP is insured.  “Native’s role is to help solve this chronic under insurance problem,” said Native co-founder and CEO Ben Davis in an interview. “No industry can grow without a liquid insurance market and so we have built a commercial insurance broker on-chain, which is what the market has really been missing.”  The aim is to increase capacity by connecting businesses with Nexus’s capital pools, while giving clients the ability to pay in crypto, or be paid in crypto if there is a claim, said the broker’s other co-founder Dan Ross. In addition, Native will go beyond mere distribution by running a capital pool on Nexus, he said. It means the firm will also be involved in underwriting in the form of a managing general agent (MGA) positioned on top of Nexus Mutual.  Since starting out in 2019, Nexus Mutual has underwritten about $5 billion of crypto assets and paid out $18 million in claims. This has involved various risks associated with decentralized finance (DeFi), for instance, that conventional insurers might struggle to meet.  The protocol also allows its members to deploy assets into syndicates, in a way similar to how the Lloyd’s of London market operates, for which they receive NXM tokens. These tokens are then used to back certain risks. Like being a Lloyd’s investor, or “Name,” there is a risk attached to this, but yields can reach around 25%, according to Nexus Mutual founder Hugh Karp.  “We understand crypto native risks better than anyone else and we've got a large amount of capacity that's specifically looking to deploy into crypto risks and crypto businesses,” Karp said in an interview. “We aren’t like some big insurance company that's trialing this as a proof of concept for a few years and then it disappears.”  Base DeFi Pass  Nexus Mutual’s insurance alternative is also available to users of many of the main protocols on Coinbase’s layer 2 network, Base, via a recently launched product called Base DeFi Pass, created by crypto insurance startup OpenCover.  Base DeFi Pass covers a clutch of high profile protocols on Base including the likes of Uniswap, Compound and Morpho, and is designed to be a “set and forget” option where one set of cover is all that’s needed across a range of applications, according to OpenCover CEO Jeremiah Smith.  The type of risks covered include smart contract code bugs, exploits and hacks, while things like phishing attacks are excluded, as are losses related to market price movements of assets used or relied upon by the covered protocol.  “Base Pass is another innovation being catalyzed by Nexus Mutual,” Smith said in an interview. “You purchase one lot of cover and you're covered on most of the leading protocols on Base, rather than having to come to Nexus and OpenCover each time and have to rebalance everything.”  In order to bring lots of people on-chain, Base needs to make those users feel confident about interacting with DeFi, said Base creator Jesse Pollak.  “OpenCover’s Base DeFi pass adds an extra safety net, so people can feel more secure and protected when they participate in the open DeFi ecosystem on Base,” Pollak said via email.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/29/defi-cover-provider-nexus-mutual-backs-new-crypto-insurance-broker-native,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6d363f9bef6a0cbf6300269abf850c6c2f99227-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373482,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmWVJ,1730191555,Dogecoin Bets Spike to $1.3B as Trump Popularity Sees DOGE Rocket 15%,"Interest in Dogecoin futures is approaching all-time highs from April, with a 33% increase in open interest since Sunday, now standing at 8 billion tokens.  Traders are attributing this price movement to Trump's popularity and the potential establishment of a ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (D.O.G.E).  Elon Musk's discussions on creating a D.O.G.E. for government efficiency, combined with Trump's promise to involve Musk in a government efficiency commission if re-elected, have fueled bullish sentiments among traders.  Futures interest in dogecoin {{DOGE}} is swiftly rising and nearing record levels from April, thanks to renewed trading interest in the token on the possibility of its abbreviation becoming a part of Republican Donald Trump’s administration.  DOGE prices are up 15% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko shows, after an Elon Musk appearance at a Trump rally and a later X post of himself with the DOGE avatar. Traders are terming the price spike as a play on “Trump’s popularity,” as reported.  DOGE-denominated futures have risen 33% since Sunday to 8 billion tokens as of European morning hours Tuesday. That’s just 12% away from a lifetime record of 9 billion DOGE in open interest.  In stablecoin terms, the DOGE bets have spiked from $850 million to $1.3 billion, CoinGlass data shows.  OI refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled. High open interest indicates that there is significant interest in a particular asset. When open interest increases along with rising prices, it suggests new money is coming into the market, indicating a strengthening trend - such as Tuesday’s.  Higher open interest in token can lead to increased volatility, especially as contracts near expiration. Traders might rush to close, roll over, or adjust positions, which can lead to significant price movements.  Musk has gotten closer to Trump in the past few months with increased donations and endorsements. On various talk shows, he has talked about creating a “Department of Government Efficiency,” abbreviated as D.O.G.E, in a quest to make government spending more efficient.  Trump has said he would enlist Musk to run a “government efficiency commission” if he wins a second term as U.S. president, per BBC.  Some traders have jumped on that narrative as a bullish catalyst in the near term.  “Elon is memeing the idea of a 'Department of Government Efficiency' into reality and is able to tie it to DOGE somehow,” influential X account @theunipcs told CoinDesk in a message. “If we get a Trump win after the U.S. elections next week, i expect an even more parabolic move in dogecoin and the 'Department of Government Efficiency' ETH memecoin because it becomes a certainty that the department will be set up.”  “There will likely a multi-month delay between Trump winning and his inauguration as well as such a department being actually set up, and that provides a solid trade opportunity,” @theunipcs added. The trader was among the first individuals to publicly state the D.O.G.E trade thesis.  DOGE prices are up more than 30% since CoinDesk first reported on the D.O.G.E trade gaining interest among traders.",POSITIVE,DOGE | ETH,DOGE | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/29/dogecoin-bets-spike-to-13b-as-trump-popularity-sees-doge-rocket-15,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac62b6355bc79fe10527046707255f903b2969b8-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A report by Citigroup attributed crypto.com’s dominance partly due to the crypto ETFs.  Digital asset trading on Crypto.com has exploded this year, pushing the crypto exchange’s volumes in North America well ahead of Coinbase (COIN).  Crypto.com’s monthly spot trading volume soared to $134 billion in September from $34 billion in July, according to data from The Block. Overall trading volumes on North American crypto exchanges was $183 billion in September, in which Coinbase handled $46 billion.  Crypto.com first overtook Coinbase in July and continues to lead so far in October. So far this month, the exchange saw $112 billion trading volume out of the overall $173 billion traded on exchanges in the region, The Block data shows. Kraken, the third-largest exchange, way behind in October with just under $10 billion in trading activity.  A key reason for Crypto.com’s popularity could be the wide range of tokens on offer. It lists over 378, ranging from mainstays bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} to memecoins, such as book of meme (BOME), to ecosystem tokens such as Jupiter’s JUP and deBridge. Coinbase and Kraken, in contrast, are more selective, offering fewer than 290 tokens each.  BTC and ETH trading dominate Crypto.com, accounting for more than 85% of all trading activity across Tether's USDT stablecoin and U.S. dollar pairs, CoinGecko data shows.  Some 26% of the exchange’s web traffic comes from the U.S., Kaiko Research said earlier this month, with most users active during U.S. trading hours.  A Citigroup report earlier this month partly attributed this dominance to the crypto ETFs that have been extremely successful in 2024.  Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, said in an X post in September that Crypto.com’s “average BTC trade size on Crypto dot com has 3x YTD” coinciding with Cboe Global Markets, a U.S.-based exchange, closing its spot crypto division.  “Liquidity has kept pace with trade volumes, suggesting market makers are also more active on the platform,” Sigel said at the time.  Meanwhile, the bump in volumes comes amid ongoing legal drama for Crypto.com. Earlier this month, the exchange filed suit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to “protect the future of the crypto industry in the U.S.,” shortly after it received a Wells notice from SEC staff.  Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said the firm brought the case to limit the SEC's ""unauthorized overreach and unlawful rulemaking,” as CoinDesk reported.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,"James Van Straten, Shaurya Malwa",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/29/cryptocom-overtakes-coinbase-to-dominate-north-american-crypto-trading-data-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3ce22f4b41794b03428649f761102605cfc33c2-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Recovery Tied To M2 Growth And Seller Exhaustion Sigel noted the correlation between former President Donald Trump’s lead in betting polls against Vice President Kamala Harris and Bitcoin’s rise. He characterized Trump as the most pro-crypto candidate, suggesting that his policies may favor the cryptocurrency market. Conversely, Sigel expressed skepticism about Harris’s understanding of Bitcoin, indicating that her administration may not prioritize cryptocurrency issues. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Breaks Above Key Resistance ‘We Could See A 25% Rally’ – Top Analyst Delving deeper into Bitcoin’s price dynamics, Sigel highlighted several critical correlations. He pointed out a negative correlation with the US dollar and a positive correlation with the global money supply growth, known as M2, leading to the current uptrend. Sigel also attributed the recent price recovery to the Federal Reserve’s pivot towards reacceleration of M2 growth, alongside what he described as a current “seller exhaustion” in the BTC market. Additionally, Sigel identified a promising bullish setup for Bitcoin as the election approaches, particularly its rising correlation with the Nasdaq, reaching a two-year high of 1.5. Sigel recalled a similar pattern from the 2020 elections, where Bitcoin exhibited low volatility until the election outcome was announced, leading to a substantial rally as new buyers flooded the market. “New buyers are born every day,” he emphasized, indicating a steady influx of interest in Bitcoin. When discussing Bitcoin’s relationship with gold and M2, Sigel described Bitcoin as a “chameleon,” highlighting its dynamic correlations that can shift over time. This variability makes it challenging to accurately predict Bitcoin’s short- and long-term behaviors. $180,000 Post-Election, $3 Million By 2050 In addition to US political dynamics, Sigel pointed to recent activities within the BRICS intergovernmental organization, particularly the involvement of new members Argentina, the UAE, and Ethiopia in Bitcoin mining. The researcher noted that these countries are leveraging government resources to mine Bitcoin to counter what he termed the “irresponsible” fiscal policies of the US. Sigel also mentioned Russia’s plans for its sovereign wealth fund to invest in Bitcoin mining through BRICS, proposing settling global trade in Bitcoin. Related Reading: GOAT Outpaces PEPE Growing To $900M Market Cap In 2 Weeks – Details When asked about potential future price points for BTC, Sigel explained that historical rallies have seen increases of around 2,000%. If Bitcoin were to achieve half of that rise post-election, it could reach approximately $180,000. Looking further ahead, Sigel referenced a model from VanEck’s digital asset research team, predicting that by 2050, Bitcoin could serve as a reserve asset for global trade, held by central banks at a rate of 2%. This model suggests a staggering $3 million per Bitcoin price by that year. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $68,900, up 1.7% over the past 24 hours.

Metaplanet first declared its decision to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset in May 2024. Adhering to a “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only” approach, Metaplanet further expanded its BTC holdings with a $2 million purchase in September.

As a result, Solana has surpassed the payment platform PayPal in market capitalization, marking a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency. Solana Market Cap Hits $83.56 Billion As of now, Solana’s market capitalization stands at approximately $83.56 billion, reflecting a 2% growth. In contrast, PayPal’s market cap is slightly lower at $83.52 billion, underscoring the growing interest and investment in SOL as it continues to attract attention from investors. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Breaks Above Key Resistance ‘We Could See A 25% Rally’ – Top Analyst In terms of trading volume, Solana has seen a remarkable increase of nearly 28% in the last 24 hours, amounting to around $2.76 billion. This contrasts sharply with PayPal, which has averaged $11.66 million in trading volume over the past three months. Despite its recent gains, Solana has faced challenges in breaking through its most important resistance level in the short term at $180, experiencing four unsuccessful attempts within the past week. This struggle has led to a slight retracement of 1% in the last 24 hours, bringing the current trading price to $175.60 per SOL. Potential Upside Breakout From Triangle Pattern Despite any short-term obstacle, crypto analyst CryptoBullet has recently shared a bullish outlook for the Solana price, suggesting that the SOL/BTC trading pair is on the verge of a “big breakout.” According to the analyst, this potential movement could represent the final leg up in Solana’s current market cycle. Previous predictions from CryptoBulltet indicated that Wave 4 of Solana’s price action on the weekly chart has concluded, setting the stage for a breakout from a “massive” triangle pattern, which could lead to new all-time highs. However, while Solana is currently trading between $175 and $179, it remains down nearly 33% from its all-time high of $259, achieved during the 2021 bull market in November.

However, given the number of bullish predictions for Solana and the broader market in the final months of the year, especially with the upcoming US elections, if the token manages to break above $180 and consolidate, the next target would be the $200 level, which has not been tested since the start of the last bearish trend at the end of July.

Last week alone, global crypto funds attracted $901 million in net inflows, pushing the total for the month to $3.4 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rebounds Above $67,000 As Whales Continue to Accumulate Bitcoin Dominates Inflows As Ethereum Sees Outflows According to CoinShares, out of the total fund flows recorded, Bitcoin-centric investment products captured the lion’s share of inflows, with $920 million in net additions over the past week. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $997.6 million in net inflows, led largely by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Bitcoin’s dominance was notable, with blockchain equities and Solana-based products also seeing inflows of $12.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively. However, other Bitcoin-based products, including those outside US markets, faced some net outflows. While Bitcoin maintained strong inflows, Ethereum-based funds recorded net outflows of $34.7 million last week, signaling a decrease in investor interest. CoinShares reported that Ethereum’s price ratio to Bitcoin had fallen to its lowest point since April 2021, which could be contributing to this outflow trend. The data suggests that while Ethereum has seen gains in the past, investors are now focusing more on Bitcoin, possibly anticipating future regulatory clarity and further mainstream adoption with developments like spot ETFs. Regional Trends And Behind The Boom Geographically, US-based crypto funds attracted a substantial $906 million in net inflows last week. In contrast, other regions saw mixed results, with funds based in Sweden, Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong collectively experiencing $29.1 million in net outflows. This difference highlights the United States’ growing role in shaping the global crypto investment market, especially as American firms like BlackRock and Fidelity expand their crypto offerings. According to CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill reveals that the we political climate likely influences the recent Bitcoin price movements and increase in inflows. He noted that Republican gains in the polls correlate with increased interest in Bitcoin investments. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stock To Flow Model Shows Price Is Ready For Next Phase Transition Above $100,000 This suggests that market participants may see a shift in political power as favourable to digital assets, potentially driving anticipation of regulatory reforms or even greater crypto acceptance. CoinShares report shows that the October influx represents roughly 12% of assets under management (AUM) in digital asset funds and marks the fourth-largest month for inflows on record. This brings the year-to-date total to $27 billion, almost tripling the previous high of $10.5 billion set in 2021.

The rally was partly driven by whale activity on Binance and substantial inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which saw a net increase of 47,000 BTC in the last two weeks.  The surge is influenced by the upcoming U.S. elections, with traders betting on bullish market conditions regardless of the outcome.  Bitcoin jumped above $71,000 in Asian morning hours Tuesday to lead a wider market move ahead, nearly a week ahead of the U.S. elections that traders largely consider a bullish catalyst for the market regardless of who wins.  BTC added 5% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, breaking out of a key $70,000 resistance with $48 billion in trading volumes, or nearly double the volumes from Monday.  The move led to over $143 million in shorts, or bets against higher prices, to be liquidated in the past 12 hours, which may have contributed to a price spike higher as traders closed losing bets. BTC shorts lost $73 million, followed by $39 million on ETH shorts, data from CoinGlass shows.  ""We see some shorts against the 70k getting liquidated as the market seems to be pricing in increasing certainty of a trump victory,"" QCP Capital co-founder Darius Sit told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  CryptoQuant community analyst Mignolet attributed part of the buying demand to whales — a colloquial term for influential traders — on crypto exchange Binance, who are appearing to be net buyers of the asset largely in Asian hours.  Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have further contributed to demand with a net inflow of 47,000 BTC over the past two weeks.  Majors led by dogecoin (DOGE) surged higher. DOGE jumped 15% on continued Trump popularity, led by shiba inu (SHIB) at 8%. Ether (ETH) rose by 4.9%, while Cardano’s ADA, Solana’s SOL, and BNB Chain’s BNB jumped by more than 3%.        The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, rose 3.3%.  Tuesday’s move higher comes amid a shift of tone ahead of the November elections, with traders expecting BTC to set fresh highs regardless of a Republican or Democrat presidential victory in the U.S.  Traders have long perceived Republican Donald Trump’s victory as a bullish catalyst for the industry for his pro-crypto stance and promises to make the U.S. a bitcoin powerhouse.  Democrat Kamala Harris, on the other hand, has not made similar promises but said he would introduce regulations to protect certain groups. However, some say the asset is poised to go higher either way as several macroeconomic factors weigh in.  Crypto options traders are increasing their bets that bitcoin will touch fresh highs by the end of November. Options due to expire on November 8 have their highest open interest at the $75,000 strike price, indicating a key market focus area for that period, as previously reported.",POSITIVE,BTC | SHIB | BNB,BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/29/bitcoin-surges-above-71k-as-wild-crypto-market-pump-sees-175m-in-shorts-liquidated,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b78c53d5ad7000469bce0d438e62b9aada206f9-6000x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite the usual volatility across all crypto assets, including blue-chip meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe, the token is up 215% this year. Raydium Rallying But Traders Must Be Cautious Taking to X, the analyst maintains that RAY will likely continue rallying as long as Pump.fun, the meme coin launchpad on Solana, is token-free. RAY is within a breakout pattern at spot rates, easing past March and July highs and printing a new 2024 high in the process. Related Reading: GOAT Outpaces PEPE Growing To $900M Market Cap In 2 Weeks – Details As it is, not only did buyers force the token above these two major liquidation levels, but it impressively shook off the weakness of August and September, more than doubling from September lows in the process. As crypto sentiment improves, the odds of RAY edging higher for the better part of Q4 2024 will only increase. For now, traders expect the “uptober” to benefit altcoins the most. If Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana prices tick higher, breaking key resistances in the coming sessions, other quality DeFi tokens, including RAY, will find major tailwinds. Despite the confidence that Q4 of every trading year brings, Bitcoin has been moving sideways, struggling to breach $70,000. If there is an upswing, perhaps triggered by the outcome of the upcoming general election in the United States, RAY could extend gains in the process. Will A Pump.fun Token Slow Down RAY Bulls? The pace at which RAY expands, recouping losses of 2022, will also depend on other market factors, including meme coin activity on Solana. Additionally, traders will determine whether Pump.fun will launch their native utility and governance token. This is crucial because liquid tokens, surpassing the 69 SOL market cap threshold, are automatically listed on Raydium. Related Reading: Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Best Altcoins For The 2025 Bull Run Pump.fun is one of the most active platforms on Solana, aiding the minting of over 2.7 million meme coins on Solana.

The eventual launch of a Pump.fun governance token will allow the platform to tap value, taking advantage of its valuation and virality. The team revealed plans to launch their token and a trading bot in a recent Twitter Spaces. As positive as this may be, there is no specific timeline for the token’s launch. A Pump.fun token could attract liquidity away from RAY, possibly dampening the DEX’s growth despite the Pump.fun-Raydium current relationship, investors will find the meme coin launchpad’s token more attractive, especially if it serves a useful purpose and allows holders to participate in governance.

42373485,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllmWqL,1730169835,"As Hong Kong Firms Downsize, Animoca Built a Workspace the Size of 10 Tennis Courts","Animoca is bucking the trend of Hong Kong's TradFi sector, expanding as banks contract.  Hong Kong is part of Animoca's DNA, and while the firm was once tempted to leave the city during COVID, it's staying put.  Hong Kong is feeling the ripple effects of a slow mainland Chinese economy, and its financial sector, as well as professional services firms, are slimming down their real estate footprint to cope with slowing demand.  Then there's Animoca Brands, a Web3 company known for its NFTs and GameFi verticals. It recently opened a new 28,000 square-foot (2,601-meter) office spread across two floors in an up-and-coming tech district on the south side of Hong Kong island. That's about 10 times the size of a tennis court.  “We went from 7,500 square feet to 28,000 square feet,” said Evan Auyang, president of Animoca Brands, during an interview with CoinDesk. “It’s a renter’s market right now in Hong Kong, and we saw this as the perfect time to create a collaborative space not just for us but for other companies in our portfolio.”  While crypto is having something of a bull market, Animoca had a rocky 2023 – like the rest of the crypto sector – battling layoffs and cutting the target size of its metaverse fund from $2 billion to $800 million.  ""As a company, we have to experiment. We have to accept failure as part of it,” he said, adding that Animoca, today, has pivoted a few times over the course of its short history.  The company's evolution is driven by a culture of experimentation and by bringing on talent that naturally pushes the company in new directions.  One thing that's new to Animoca, and different from other Web3 companies, is the amount of gray hair in the building.  “Our executive team is fairly experienced. We’re not kids in our 20s. Most of us are in our 40s and 50s,” Auyang said. “We’ve been through a lot.""  Read more Consensus Hong Kong-related coverage here.  Auyang highlights the importance of government backing in Animoca's decision to stay in Hong Kong, describing it as ""invaluable"" pointing to a pivotal moment when the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau announced its support for Web3 alongside Animoca’s co-founder and executive chairman, Yat Siu.  “When the [FSTB] announced Hong Kong’s ambitions for Web3, they did it on stage with Yat Siu. That level of partnership is unique,” he said.  Hong Kong’s unique creative energy, fueled by its rich heritage in film, music, and art, is something Animoca believes can’t be replicated elsewhere.  While the company could theoretically operate from anywhere – and Auyang said that Hong Kong's prolonged Covid-19 lockdowns had Animoca on the brink of some tough decisions – it ultimately just couldn't leave the city.  “During COVID, we thought about relocating. We could be anywhere.” Auyang said. “But ultimately, we were born here. Hong Kong is part of our DNA.”  UPDATE (Oct. 29, 03:50 UTC): Updates Yat Siu's title.

35266548,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650428,1730169197,"Is Bitcoin Ready To Break Through $70,000? Analyzing The Next Steps For The Crypto Leader","As the US presidential election draws near, Bitcoin has briefly surged to the $70,000 mark for the first time in over five months. This milestone coincides with former President Donald Trump leading in polls against Vice President Kamala Harris, setting the stage for potential shifts in the cryptocurrency landscape depending on the election outcome. $70,000 As Key Level For Bitcoin To Surpass March Record The recent uptick in Bitcoin’s price has been bolstered by a rally in the stock market, with analysts noting that investors are increasingly pricing in a potential Trump victory. Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG Australia Pty, indicated that Bitcoin needs to maintain a solid break past $70,000 to build confidence in surpassing its previous record of $73,798 set in March. Trump has positioned himself as a pro-crypto candidate, pledging to make the US the cryptocurrency capital of the world. In contrast, Harris has taken a more cautious stance, advocating for a regulatory framework for the industry. Amidst the political backdrop, options traders have ramped up their bets, with many speculating that Bitcoin could reach $80,000 by the end of November, irrespective of who wins the election. Related Reading: Are ‘ETF Paper Bitcoins’ Suppressing BTC Prices? Analyst Provides Answers Implied volatility around Election Day on November 5 has also risen, reflecting the uncertainty in the market. Notably, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen approximately $3.1 billion in net inflows this month, further contributing to the positive sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Concerns Surround Harris’s Stance On Crypto Crypto analyst VirtualBacon recently highlighted the significance of the upcoming election for the cryptocurrency market, dubbing it the “Crypto Election.” Prediction markets currently favor Trump at 60%, although these figures may be skewed due to the crypto community’s historical support for him. National polls indicate a tighter race, with Harris holding a slight lead of just over 1%. The crypto industry has contributed approximately $119 million to campaigns this election year, representing nearly half of all corporate donations. However, major players like Coinbase and Ripple are strategically donating across party lines to promote supportive legislation rather than backing a single candidate. While both Trump and Harris have publicly expressed favorable views on cryptocurrency, their commitments to concrete legislative action remain uncertain. Harris’s regulatory approach raises concerns, as her campaign has emphasized protecting minority investors in digital assets without providing specifics. Moreover, her tenure as Vice President coincided with the appointments of prominent crypto critics such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler, and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. On the other hand, Trump’s evolving views towards cryptocurrency, including the launch of a successful NFT project and a DeFi platform, suggest a warming to the industry. As the election approaches, VirtualBacon suggests that it’s crucial to consider that economic data released post-election will significantly influence market sentiment. The upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in November could provide critical insights into inflation and liquidity, impacting both the broader market and the trajectory of cryptocurrencies. BTC’s Path To $100,000 Despite the speculation surrounding the impact of the presidential election, which is just 7 days away, another analyst, Ali Martinez, noted that over the past eleven years, seven of them have seen massive gains for the market’s leading crypto. As can be seen in the chart provided by Martinez, the average November gain for BTC is a massive 46%, which if the market follows these late patterns, could see a November price of just over $100,000 per coin.

35264972,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=650274,1730165441,Bitcoin Potential For Monetary Policy Sparks Growing Interest Among Central Banks,"Bitcoin, the world’s top cryptocurrency, is designed to act as a money or payment option outside anyone’s control. Using the crypto, which is decentralized and peer-to-peer, removes the involvement of third parties, like central banks. This Bitcoin promise has redefined the financial landscape, helped the unbanked, and empowered those who want independence. However, the ecosystem has its share of critics, including central banks. Related Reading: Floki Inu Warning: Analyst Says ‘Prepare For The Crash’ – Details Central banks’ role shrinks as the Bitcoin ecosystem grows and its use cases expand. This prevailing belief is validated by a growing amount of research from financial institutions and central banks that assess Bitcoin’s disruptive nature. The ever-increasing narrative focuses on Bitcoin’s role in promoting inequality and its potential to disrupt central banks’ policies. The Role Of Bitcoin In Distributing Wealth One subject of central banks’ studies highlights Bitcoin’s role in wealth distribution. To help us understand Bitcoin’s role, we look at two papers published by the European Central Bank. The first paper, published after the FTX fiasco in 2022, is titled “Bitcoin’s Last Stand,” which sees the top crypto as a failed monetary project nearing its end. But in 2024, when Bitcoin hit an all-time high, the same researchers filed another study, painting Bitcoin positively. The paper argued that crypto can impact wealth distribution, but only the early holders get richer. Since Bitcoin or crypto use doesn’t produce a product or service, the increased wealth of early adopters comes from the reduced consumption of all other members of society. Does BTC Disrupt Monetary Policies? Other finance-related researches look at Bitcoin’s impact on monetary policies. For example, the Minneapolis Federal Reserve argues that when people can hold and use Bitcoin, it is difficult for the state to run budget deficits regularly. Traditionally, the government can just offer bonds in case there’s a deficit in revenue collection. But governments may only spend what they usually collect if there’s Bitcoin. The study suggests two options: one, to ban Bitcoin’s adoption, and two, to tax this asset. In addition to the Minneapolis paper, an IMF policy paper in 2023 highlighted Bitcoin’s effect on monetary policy. The paper argues that Bitcoin impacts a state’s policy, and emerging markets are most vulnerable. As a solution, the researchers recommend strengthening their monetary policies first before banning Bitcoin. Related Reading: MicroStrategy Stock Hits All-Time High As Bitcoin Blazes Past $67,000 Central Banks, Financial Institutions Now Take Bitcoin Seriously Recent studies and research from central banks indicate that Bitcoin is redefining finance. While these papers don’t mirror the ideas and thinking of policymakers at these institutions, they give us insight into how the industry sees Bitcoin. Some recent policies, including the IMF 2022 Argentina bailout recommendations, include a few anti-cryptocurrency provisions. Bitcoin’s continued popularity is now becoming an obstacle for many central banks in their efforts to create monetary policies. One of the main aims of Bitcoin’s supporters is to offer the public an alternative financing landscape free from the direction, if not, clutches of banks.

Bitcoin US To The Rest Reserve Ratio Has Seen A Reversal Recently In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the recent trend in the BTC US to The Rest Reserve Ratio. This indicator tells us, as its name suggests, the ratio between the total Bitcoin reserves of the US-based centralized platforms and that of the global ones. Platforms here refer to not just the exchanges, but also other entities like banks and funds. When the value of this metric is rising, it means the asset is currently moving from offshore platforms to American ones. Such a trend can be a sign of demand from the US-based investors. On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests the foreign platforms have higher demand for BTC right now as the American exchanges are losing dominance to them. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Not Over Yet? This Ratio Has Just Seen A Golden Cross Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the Bitcoin US to The Reserve Ratio over the past year and a half: As displayed in the above graph, the 100-day EMA Bitcoin US to The Rest Reserve Ratio had been declining earlier in the year, but during the past couple of months, its value has bottomed out and shown a reversal to the upside. This would mean that a transfer of BTC is now occurring from global platforms to the US-based ones. In the chart, the quant has marked the last instance of the indicator displaying this trend. It would appear that the previous turnaround in the metric had occurred in the last quarter of 2023 and had accompanied a BTC rally that would eventually take the asset to a new all-time high (ATH). The sharpest part of this increase in the indicator had come in the first quarter of 2024. The reason behind this acceleration had been the introduction of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, which had quickly gained popularity among the investors.

Thus, the spot ETFs couldn’t keep up the same level of interest. The analyst notes that BTC’s sustained consolidation this year can be traced back to this decrease in the reserve of the US-based platforms. Since the indicator has once again shown a turnaround recently, it’s possible that Bitcoin could see the return of bullish momentum, if the previous pattern is to go by. BTC Price Following a 2% jump during the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has returned back to the $68,700 level.
