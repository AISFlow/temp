42396178,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT14RT,1643239674,First Mover Asia: Interest Rate Hikes in the Future? Crypto Rally Shorts Out,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin gave up early gains after Powell’s hawkish comments.  Technician's take: Long-term momentum remains weak and BTC is at a critical point.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $36,826 -0.3%  Ether (ETH): $2,470 +0.7%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Polygon MATIC +5.5% Smart Contract Platform Dogecoin DOGE +5.1% Currency Solana SOL +3.0% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM −5.8% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP −2.9% Computing Stellar XLM −1.0% Smart Contract Platform     Markets  S&P 500: 4,349 -0.1%  DJIA: 34,168 -0.3%  Nasdaq: 13,542 +.02%  Gold: $1,816 -1.7%  Market moves  A relief rally in crypto that had bitcoin trading near $39,000 was short-lived as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fell back below $37,000 after the U.S. Federal Reserve released a statement Wednesday about reducing the size of its balance sheet.  At the time of publication, bitcoin was changing hands at about $36,800, down slightly over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. Ether, the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading over $2,450 and was up slightly during the same time period.  Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s spot trading volume across major crypto exchanges rose on Wednesday compared with a day ago.  Bitcoin briefly rose to nearly $39,000 right after the U.S. central bank released its statement, as the market believed the news was already “priced in.”  Following the stock market, bitcoin gave up the earlier gains as investors and traders weighed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments.  Powell said that he won't rule out an interest rate hike at a future meeting and signaled that the central bank would steadily remove support for the economy in order to fight high inflation.  “After hearing Fed Chair Powell talk, it became clear the risk of more rate hikes was elevated,” Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote in his daily market newsletter. “...The Fed may raise rates at every other meeting, with the balance sheet runoff starting in May or June.”  But Moya added that the panic selling of cryptocurrencies may be over as a rally in alternative cryptocurrencies could be coming if bitcoin can stabilize at between $40,000 and $50,000.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Oversold Bounce Faces Resistance at $40K-$43K  Bitcoin rose from deeply oversold levels over the past two days, indicating renewed buying after a sharp sell-off. The cryptocurrency faces initial resistance at $40,000-$43,000, which could stall the current price bounce.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is rising from extreme oversold levels, which could keep buyers active this week. On the weekly chart, the RSI is approaching oversold territory, similar to what happened last July in what was a prelude to a strong price rally.  Still, momentum signals remain weak, indicating limited upside from here. That means buyers will need to make a decisive move above $40,000 to signal a recovery phase.  For now, the downtrend from November remains intact with immediate support at $37,000 and lower support at $30,000.

This had sent the cryptocurrency back towards six-month lows. One thing though was that liquidations or the digital asset remained lower than expected. The current liquidation volumes lay well below the volumes that have accompanied previous crashes like this one. This could be a very important indicator for the market. Bitcoin Liquidations Remain Low In Shakeout Previously, whenever the price of bitcoin had dumped this hard, liquidation volumes have quickly risen. This is due to the massive sell-offs that follow such crashes as investors try to get out of a bleeding market. This time around, bitcoin liquidation volumes have not jumped. They remain really low, indicating that maybe investors were not done selling their holdings. Related Reading | Has Bitcoin Reached Its Bottom?

42375431,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7o0L,1643234312,Tesla Reports Bitcoin Holdings Unchanged in Q4,"The value of Tesla's (TSLA) bitcoin holdings at the end of the fourth quarter remained unchanged from the end of the previous quarter at $1.26 billion, the electric car maker said in its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday.  Tesla did not buy or sell any bitcoin in the quarter, nor did it record any impairments to the value of its bitcoin holdings because the price of bitcoin was essentially flat from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter.  In the third quarter, Tesla also did not add to or reduce its bitcoin holdings, but was required to report a $51 million impairment to reflect the decline in the price of the cryptocurrency.  According to accounting rules for digital assets, if the price of an asset falls during a quarter, a company must report an impairment. But if the price increases, it is not reported as a gain on the balance sheet.  Tesla announced in February it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Later in Q1, the company trimmed its bitcoin position by 10%, a sale that boosted that quarter’s earnings by $272 million. Tesla didn’t buy or sell any bitcoin in the second quarter.  Overall, Tesla’s adjusted Q4 earnings per share came in at $2.54 versus the $2.36 expected by analysts, according to FactSet. Revenue came in at $17.7 billion against the $17.1 billion expected.  Tesla’s share price initially fell about 4% after the release of the earnings but then recovered. Shares were most recently up slightly to $939.51.

The spotlight was on the U.S. Federal Reserve, which stated at the conclusion of its two-day meeting that it will ""soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.""  The latest Fed decision comes as the central bank has been winding down its asset-purchasing program. Monetary stimulus has been an important source of market support, which underpinned the rise in both equities and cryptocurrencies over the past year.  BTC reversed earlier gains shortly after the Fed announcement on Wednesday. Analysts remain skeptical, noting the recent bounce occurred on low conviction among buyers.  ""Short-positioned traders are dominating the derivative market. This indicates that bitcoin's bounce was driven by [the spot market] rather than derivatives, which is confluent with the significant bidding seen on Coinbase,"" Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the UK-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin options activity  Analysts have noticed bearish positioning among bitcoin option traders, which indicates a high level of uncertainty around current price levels. For example, data from Genesis Volatility shows that retail option traders have been net-short March $40,000 BTC calls and net-long March $35K puts – a bearish trade.  On a more positive note, BTC also saw a large increase in call open interest and volume led by the March $40,000 strike price, which is bullish. Further, large institutional traders have been taking the opposite side of bearish option trades, according to a blog post by Delphi Digital.  Overall, mixed views among option traders could point to higher volatility, especially over the next two months.  Altcoin roundup  Dogecoin leads gains among major cryptos: Prices of BTC, ETH and other major cryptocurrencies rose as much as 7% shortly before New York trading hours, with meme coin dogecoin (DOGE) leading gains among the biggest assets by market capitalization.

42375436,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7o6d,1643229264,"SundaeSwap Switcheroo Leaves CardStarter Users With Losses, Spreading Cardano Discord","A falling-out between two startup projects on Cardano has spilled out onto social media, reaching such rancor that the blockchain's founder, Charles Hoskinson, took to YouTube this week to admonish the teams to ""get your s**t together.""  The conflict is between CardStarter, which describes itself as a ""decentralized accelerator"" for startup projects focused on Cardano, and SundaeSwap, a decentralized exchange built on Cardano.  At the heart of the matter is what appears to be a now-soured marketing agreement that's got the two projects' leaders accusing each other of broken verbal commitments and promises.  The dispute could cast a pall over Cardano, sometimes described as an ""Ethereum killer"" because of its ambitions to compete with Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, which has become the dominant venue for development of technologies ranging from decentralized finance, known as DeFi, to NFT trading. Even Hoskinson, who previously helped found Ethereum, acknowledged that the dispute risked damaging the ""brand of the ecosystem as a whole.""  The bickering with CardStarter adds to the controversy already surrounding SundaeSwap, which went live last week – only to be slammed by user complaints over extreme delays in receiving the project's native SUNDAE tokens. SundaeSwap representatives had to post a notice on its website pleading for patience.  But the spat between CardStarter and SundaeSwap has been in the making for nine months, starting with an initially harmonious plan to join forces but ending with harsh recriminations on both sides and complaints of steep financial losses.  For Cardano investors, the latest episode might show just how complex and difficult it can be to build a community of blockchain projects, developers and traders without significant growing pains.  Auspicious start  In April 2021, CardStarter announced the launch of CardSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that was marketed as similar to Ethereum's Uniswap - but for the Cardano blockchain. CardStarter stated that there would also be a liquidity mining program where providers could earn CSWAP tokens as rewards – incentivizing users through the attractiveness of getting in early.  Then in June, CardStarter entered an agreement with SundaeSwap to essentially team up: CardStarter would cease development of a competing CardSwap decentralized exchange and promise to contribute liquidity to SundaeSwap. The deal was announced publicly in a press release in July.  In an AMA (Ask Me Anything) forum on Twitter in July, Ashwin Somasundaram, CardStarter’s senior operations advisor, was asked: “Is this an integration between CSWAP and SundaeSwap? Is it essentially a replacement of CardSwap?”  Somasundaram responded: “This is a merger, and Sundae is the name of the main DEX where a lot of this will be taking place.”  Somasundaram also said in the AMA that the CSWAP community will be ""very well taken care of by all of us,"" and that they are getting an ""amazing end of this deal.""  Fast forward to October. That's when, according to CardStarter CEO Aatash Amir, SundaeSwap officials agreed to set aside 150 million SUNDAE tokens for the CardStarter partnership.  A Jan. 24 tweet from CardStarter shows screenshots of a group Telegram chat between the two entities where they appeared to lay out the plan.  The screenshots show a portion of a conversation where SundaeSwap’s chief information officer tells Amir that 7.5% of the total supply of Sundae had been set aside for the CardStarter partnership. (That would be 150 million tokens of the reported 2 billion in supply.)  Then on Jan. 18, Artem Wright, SundaeSwap’s co-founder, wrote in a Telegram chat to the CardStarter team stating that the number of SUNDAE tokens allocated to the partnership would be reduced to 10 million.  When asked about the reduction on the Telegram group chat, Wright confirmed it and said that “We feel that 10M is the fair amount for what is available today.”  The reduction was based on there being “significantly less” total value locked (TVL) in the CardSwap-affiliated liquidity pool than both entities expected, according to the screenshots released by CardStarter. ""Total value locked"" is a commonly cited metric used in DeFi to signify how much collateral has been put into a protocol; it's a key gauge of a project's size and popularity.  Wright said in an interview with CoinDesk that CardStarter promised $200 million or more of TVL to SundaeSwap.  “Over the period of our negotiations, we went from expecting upwards of $200 million in liquidity to $10 million, resulting in lower token amounts negotiated in return,"" Wright said.  CoinDesk reached out to CardStarter for comment on whether the team ever agreed to provide $200 million of TVL, but there was no response by press time.  What the data shows  CoinDesk checked data from the DeFi exchange Uniswap to independently assess the TVL associated with CardStarter.  On Oct. 31 – the day that SundaeSwap reportedly agreed to offer 150 million Sundae tokens to CSWAP holders – CARDS had a TVL of $18.5 million, according to data from Uniswap.  On Jan. 20, the TVL on CARDS was slightly lower, at $17.5 million.  James Thornton, an IT consultant from the UK who is a CSWAP investor, said he was skeptical that the CardStarter team would have ever agreed to accept just 7.5% of the SUNDAE tokens in exchange for $200 million of TVL. Thornton contacted CoinDesk after this reporter posted a message in a SundaeSwap community Telegram channel seeking sources to discuss the matter.  “No DEX partner would agree to stop making their DEX to port over $200 million TVL for 7.5% of tokens in return,"" Thornton said. ""They’d want at least 80%.”  Whatever the case, SundaeSwap's decision to reduce the allocation meant that CSWAP holders couldn't get all the SUNDAE tokens they thought they were entitled to.  As word trickled out, CardStarter’s CARDS token, which was changing hands around $9 on Jan. 18, has tumbled to about $3 now. As recently as last May, they were trading around $80.  The CardStarter liquidity providers began expressing their disappointment and labeling the unwinding as a “rug pull” on social media in various tweets, Telegram groups and on Discord.  Alec, a university student from Melbourne, Australia, said in an interview with CoinDesk that he personally lost $300,000 from mining CSWAP tokens and said he would “never have invested if Sundae didn't endorse this deal publicly and make it seem like CSWAP holders were going to be very well looked after.”  Alec invested his money to provide liquidity for SundaeSwap’s upcoming DEX, under the impression he was going to be rewarded with SUNDAE tokens.  Darren, a healthcare worker from Australia who asked that his last name be kept confidential to protect his privacy, said he lost about $116,000 on CSWAP itself and a further $30,000 to “impermanent loss,” as a provider of liquidity for CARDS-ETH LP, which is the liquidity pool on Uniswap that would eventually be to migrated over to SundaeSwap.  “SundaeSwap wanted the CSWAP liquidity for the health of its DEX,"" Darren said. ""It was advised that mining would continue, as the requirement was to move our CSWAP liquidity over to SundaeSwap once the DEX is live.”  “Most of us have held our CSWAP liquidity from May-June 2021 till this day, as we were migrating over to SundaeSwap,” said Darren. “As a result we’ve incurred impermanent losses due to the CARDS token depreciating, because of a combination of market conditions and mostly the Jan. 20 news.”  Thornton said he lost over $200,000 providing liquidity.  “The deal went sour and the CARDS token dropped,"" Thornton recalled.  “I committed my life savings over nine months to provide liquidity for SundaeSwap’s upcoming DEX, under the impression I was to be rewarded with SUNDAE tokens,” he said. “After our money being held in a lock for over half a year and losing 90% of its value, we still have zero access to our liquidity.”  According to CoinMarketCap, the CSWAP tokens were trading around $0.21 cents just prior to the Jan. 20 statement from SundaeSwap. Now, they're around $0.03  SundaeSwap responded to the backlash on social media, denying that there was ever a merger agreement or a promise of SUNDAE tokens.  “SundaeSwap and CardStarter entered into a 'Marketing and Collaboration Agreement' in June 2021. This was not in any sense a 'merger' of the two entities, as explained in our own announcement about the agreement,” SundaeSwap said in a tweet.  Words chosen 'poorly'  In a subsequent blog post, SundaeSwap acknowledged that it had used vague terms on occasions when communicating with users.  “Members of our team have on two occasions chosen their words poorly when characterizing the Agreement and hoped-for future liquidity-provision relationship,” the blog post read.  SundaeSwap’s Wright said no promises were made to CardStarter regarding SUNDAE tokens.  Wright told CoinDesk in an interview that an agreement in June between the two entities includes CardStarter’s promise to not build its own DEX, and “it very clearly says they were getting nothing from SundaeSwap for doing that.”  Wright also said that the screenshots tweeted by CardStarter are “incomplete snippets of our months-long negotiations.”  What the agreement says  A copy of the June “Collaboration and Marketing Agreement” obtained by CoinDesk shows that SundaeSwap committed to providing favored status to listing pairs contributed by CardStarter within the first year after the decentralized exchange’s launch.  No amount of tokens were specified in the agreement. It further stipulates that each party's liability to the other will not exceed $5,000.  The agreement was signed by SundaeSwap's Motavaf and CardStarter's Amir.  The document stated that no other agreements would be deemed binding, whether oral or written.  SundaeSwap provided an address in Greenbrae, California, while CardStarter's is a post office box in the British Virgin Islands.  Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  Hoskinson, the Cardano founder, initially responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment on Monday, writing in an email that “I’m a bit under informed on this story myself and being brought up to speed. I’m happy to chat later in the week after I’ve had some time to read up on it.”  Then on Monday evening, Hoskinson hosted a YouTube stream where he was critical of how the two organizations handled the situation. He said that it was unacceptable for SundaeSwap and CardStarter to use social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram to make their case.  “It’s despicable,” Hoskinson said. “It doesn’t do anything other than try to abdicate your personal responsibility and damage the brand of the ecosystem as a whole.”  Hoskinson added: “Please, people, get your s**t together. Both sides come together, agree to arbitration, talk to each other, and figure out whatever the hell you agree to get done. And if you can’t somehow survive the arbitration process, the courts are always available to you.”  When asked whether the dispute would affect Cardano’s reputation, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Corinthian Digital, said it's yet another example of communication gone wrong in the world of digital assets and crypto project launches.  “Regardless of the actual situation between SundaeSwap and CardStarter, acting like squabbling squirrels in public is not the way to go and only hurts Cardano's prospects of competing for institutional money allocation,” said Vinokourov.  Cardano’s ADA token is down 27% in one month, trading at around $1.11 at press time, though bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have also sold off sharply in a broad market retreat.

42417087,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRwer7,1643224539,"For Enterprises, Privacy Is the Critical Blockchain Feature","Blockchain privacy is really hard.  Central to the magic of blockchain technology is the consensus algorithm, the tool that maintains the validity of the entire network. The simplest way to understand a consensus algorithm is that it involves everyone being able to check everyone else’s work. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) are an almost magical form of math that allow you to provide mathematical proof that a statement is true without providing the underlying supporting data. Using ZKPs, we can replace actual data with a proof, maintaining the integrity of the network but enabling user privacy.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Privacy Week series. Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader.  ZKPs are themselves hard to implement and run efficiently. Zcash pioneered their use on a blockchain in 2016 and Ethereum incorporated some key changes making them possible in 2017. At EY, we started work on privacy applications back in 2016 and focused seriously on ZKPs in 2017. We became the first to implement a ZKP-based privacy solution on Ethereum back in 2018 when we showed off the Nightfall beta at Devcon in Prague. At the time, our solution was so complex we needed multiple entire Ethereum blocks to execute a single transaction. We built a simple prototype supply chain as a demonstration and it cost us nearly $300,000 in ETH at today’s prices to run the transactions on the mainnet.  Since 2018, we have kept working on Nightfall, putting our work into the public domain and inviting others to contribute and work alongside us on this path. The current iteration, Nightfall 3, is an Optimistic Rollup that delivers at or near the lowest transaction cost of any solution available. It is the foundation of the Polygon Nightfall layer 2 companion network. This year, about five years after getting started, we will finally see a commercially viable solution launch.  Given the immense time and cost involved in implementing blockchain privacy, it’s reasonable to wonder if it’s worth all the time and effort. When it comes to enterprise usage, there can be no doubt. For some applications, such as fungible financial assets, public blockchains without privacy are not so far away from stock exchanges and other public markets where it is possible to see price and volume but not have a good idea of who is buying or selling.  It’s a different story if you are moving around tokens specific to your product. In those cases, you’re now showing lots of business information – like your production rate, inventories and sales. Companies strongly prefer to keep that kind of data under wraps.  Read more: Alyssa Hertig - Bitcoin Isn’t Private – But Its Recent Taproot Upgrade Will Help  Blockchains represent a terrific opportunity to erase the data silos between companies with standardized and integrated information. Companies could represent their inventory movements as the transfers of digital tokens. Because a token can only be owned by one participant at a time, the system forces reconciliation between parties and will result in much higher accuracy.  Not only would blockchain-based supply chains be much more accurate, they would also be much more efficient. Companies today must painstakingly match up purchase orders, invoices and shipments and then verify that prices paid are in alignment with those agreed in the master contract between buyer and seller. On-chain, smart contracts would automatically keep track of prices, applying volume discounts and rebates, and automating payments when deliveries are made.  Our early experience with partners like Microsoft tells us that we can cut the cycle-time required to handle documents by more than 90% on a blockchain and the cost of administration by around 50%. Unfortunately, without strong privacy, none of this is going to get widespread adoption. If a company were to implement these processes today, their competition would instantly be able to see how much it was producing, how much it was buying in raw materials, its key sales markets, and even the prices paid all along the supply chain. Data points like these are often among a company’s most closely guarded secrets.  The good news is that, after a long wait and a lot of effort, robust privacy tools for enterprises are on the way. Using Ethereum layer 2 networks such as Polygon Nightfall, it will be possible to trade financial tokens as well as privately transfer supply chain tokens. For those holding the tokens, they will have access to history information and traceability. But to external observers, all they will see is a continuous flow of mathematical proofs.  Secure, private token transfers are a good start, but they don’t reflect the whole picture. The second part of the puzzle is how to enable secure business logic so smart contracts can execute business logic in addition to simply moving tokens privately. If you think about the typical business agreement between two parties, it involves the exchange of money for stuff under the terms of an agreement. Digital tokens are great for representing both the “money” and the “stuff” whether they are real or virtual, crypto or fiat.  Read more: David Chaum - Internet Privacy Is an Inalienable Right  The agreement part is more complicated. Agreements typically include complex logic such as, “If I spend more than $1 million dollars, reduce all my list prices by 10% for the rest of the calendar year.” Turning this into private logic that is both secure and scalable is more challenging but also achievable. There are several approaches that can be used here, including asking both parties to do the same calculations off-chain and compare results as well as converting the entire logic into a mathematical circuit based on a zero-knowledge proof. We’re working on both approaches.  It is my goal that before the end of 2022, we will not only have multiple privacy-enabling supply chain solutions on the market, including our own and others, but we will also see the first solutions that can handle complex logic with privacy and we will also see privacy tools more systematically applied all kinds of blockchain solutions. We have already built our first DAO for a client that uses zero-knowledge proofs for secure, private voting.  Privacy matters. The internet before widespread encryption was an interesting place, but it wasn’t commercially very useful. Every message, every transaction occurred in full public view. It was only the arrival of scalable public key encryption built into the web browser that suddenly turned the internet into the world’s commercial infrastructure. Before then, inputting your credit card number into a web form was only for the most foolishly daring among us. When we look back upon the history of blockchain technology, I think we will come to see the widespread deployment of privacy technology in the same light.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/26/for-enterprises-privacy-is-the-critical-blockchain-feature,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b2a883533d667ae5b2e603a274126275ae7b4f16-3858x2843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42375430,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7nxp,1643224359,"Fed Keeps Interest Rates at Zero, Says Hike Appropriate ‘Soon’","The U.S. Federal Reserve said Wednesday it would hold interest rates near zero, even as it edges closer to removing some of the extraordinary stimulus provided to financial markets since the coronavirus hit in March 2020.  The benchmark U.S. short-term interest rate will remain in the current range between 0% and 0.25%, according to a statement Wednesday from the Fed's monetary-policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  The Fed also released a separate statement announcing it intends to ""significantly"" reduce the size of its balance sheet ""in a predictable manner"" after rate hikes start.  “The balance sheet is substantially larger than it needs to be,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference. “There’s a substantial amount of shrinkage in the balance sheet that needs to be done.”  The Fed’s emergency monetary stimulus has swollen its balance sheet to about $8.9 trillion, from just $4.1 trillion in early 2020.  Crypto traders are monitoring the report because some analysts say bitcoin's price could move in response to Fed decisions. Removing monetary accommodation tends to put downward pressure on the price of assets considered risky, including cryptocurrencies and stocks.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) briefly rose 2.5% after the decision was announced on Wednesday afternoon before falling back to slightly below its previous level. It was recently trading at $37,725, up 1.5% over the previous 24 hours.  ""With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,” the Fed said in a statement after the two-day, closed-door meeting.  Inflation might not go back to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon, according to Powell.  ""There’s a risk that the high inflation we are seeing will be prolonged. There’s a risk that it will move even higher. So, we don’t think that’s the base case, but, you asked what the risks are, and we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes,"" he said.  The latest Fed decision comes as the central bank has been winding down its asset-purchasing program, an emergency source of market support that involved printing tens of billions of dollars a month in fresh money to buy Treasury bonds and mortgage securities.  That program is targeted for completion as soon as March, and many traders and economists expect the Fed to start raising interest rates at the FOMC's next meeting that month. That would be the first rate increase since 2018.  While both crypto markets and stocks have swooned recently, economists say the Fed might need to tighten monetary policy now to address growing concerns about inflation.  The U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 7% in December from 12 months earlier, the highest since 1982.  While some analysts think of bitcoin as an inflation hedge, experience has shown that it sometimes trades more like a stock – rising when the Fed keeps monetary policy loose and reversing when the central bank tightens.  “You’ve got a very hawkish Fed,” Galaxy Investment Partners CEO Mike Novogratz said on CNBC. “We’re going through a big re-rating” in global markets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""A lot of the beatdown has happened,” he said, but added, “It’s going to be a tough year for assets. ... We're going through a paradigm shift.""  Some analysts suggest the pressure from the Fed might sap bitcoin returns this year to the extent that crypto traders might be better off holding digital stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar.  “One of the main reasons investors might choose stablecoins over cryptos like BTC or others is the lower level of volatility,” said Scott Bauer, a former Goldman Sachs trader who's now CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.

The latest project to make the plunge into the growing ecosystem is SuperLayer, a Web 3 venture studio and part of the RLY network, which announced it was launching onto Solana on Wednesday.  The studio was formed following an August vote to split the platform into five separate entities in a bid for decentralization. (SuperLayer is to Rally as ConsenSys is to Ethereum.)  SuperLayer says it is currently incubating over a dozen Solana-based social token projects, with additional plans to build play-to-earn games and liquidity offerings for its RLY token.  “Moving to Solana is one of the big steps we made to solve a lot of the problems building Web 3 products on a blockchain like Ethereum,” Mahesh Vellanki, managing partner of SuperLayer, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Whether we call them engage-to-earn, play-to-earn, learn-to-earn, we’re building architecture in a way where we can distribute rewards to users for doing simple tasks.”  Read more: Top NFL Prospect Kayvon Thibodeaux Taps Rally to Launch Own Cryptocurrency  While the popularity of social tokens remains dwarfed by demand for non-fungible tokens (NFT) on marketplaces like OpenSea, Rally’s success on Ethereum (even with its high transaction fees) has been notable.

42417093,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS0Xlt,1643220225,Criminals Still Find It Easier to Hide in Fiat Than Crypto,"Contrary to popular lore, cryptocurrencies are not a haven for anonymous criminals.  In fact, because of smart blockchain analytics, it’s easier to follow money trails on blockchains than it is on legacy payment networks, however a circuitous route they may take.  What’s still hard to figure out – at least for the time being – is the identity of the criminals using various blockchain addresses to move stolen funds. This is especially true if they use self-hosted wallets.  Avivah Litan is a Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner Research. This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  Blockchains are more transparent than fiat payment networks  Transparent blockchains are much easier platforms for tracking criminal payments than siloed legacy payment systems ever were. Today, about 23 public blockchains make up about 99% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. That means that blockchain fraud detection systems must integrate with just 23 transparent platforms rather than thousands of siloed enterprise and fiat payment networks.  The hard part is turning nondescript blockchain metadata into meaningful information. If done well, using scalable real-time analytics, automated insights can help users see across all blockchain platforms at once, trace criminal and suspect payments and addresses and identify abnormal money movement patterns that are often repeated.  Emerging blockchain intelligence  Vendors like Chainalysis Ciphertrace, Elementus and TRM Labs provide insights on money trails to authorities investigating hacks. Their services are increasingly used by exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to prevent fraud in the first place.  In 2021, high-profile hacks resulted in criminals returning stolen funds or law enforcement clawing them back. Criminals are finding it difficult to hide from investigators who identify addresses where stolen funds are parked. Once stolen funds are marked, they cannot be easily moved off the blockchain without being seized by watchful parties and law enforcement.  See also: Crypto Crime Hit All-Time High of $14B in 2021: Chainalysis  It is simply getting harder for criminals to move stolen funds off crypto networks. We see this repeatedly, for example in the hacks of Poly Network and BadgerDao and the freeze of the tether stablecoin.  Tying addresses to identities: the missing link  Detecting blockchain addresses used by criminals doesn’t yield the identity of the address’ owner. No KYC (or know-your-customer procedure) is required to use a blockchain unless a user onboards through a virtual asset service provider (VASP) that complies with regulations. Most criminals use self-hosted wallets and are their own “banks.”  Several startups fill this identity-knowledge gap for law enforcement targeting criminals or investors analyzing successful investment strategies. These startups identify address owners by scraping websites and using analytics to associate addresses with multiple user attributes, like social network profiles, geolocations, mobile numbers and email addresses. They collect data from darknets, social networks and open-source forums, and purchase data from proprietary sources when possible.  Hundreds of companies already engage in similar Web 2 data aggregation to support threat intelligence, marketing, loan approval and other use cases, generating profitable data markets worth billions of dollars.  See also: Creating the On-Ramp for Web 3  Over time, users will increasingly authenticate to Web 3 apps using blockchain wallets. Service providers will need to rely on blockchain data analytics for risk mitigation, marketing, crypto-market monitoring and more. Blockchain data analytics will grow into a large profitable market, subject to regulatory constraints.  Pushback: Privacy protocols for blockchain addresses  Blockchain addresses are key to Web 3 identities, and so privacy-sensitive cryptocurrency traders take measures to maintain address anonymity. For example, they spread holdings out across multiple addresses, use mixers for transacting or trade in privacy coins like monero, pivx or zcash.  New proprietary privacy protocols go further and hide individual addresses and balances from public view. Soon we will see privacy “services” allow crypto traders to transact without revealing addresses. However, these services will likely be centralized and not necessarily trustworthy.  As privacy protocols that hide user addresses gain more adoption, blockchain intelligence firms will rely on alternative identity indicators to follow money trails. For example, they can pinpoint a transacting endpoint and use social graphs to link its activity – e.g., text and call metadata, interaction frequencies and size – to open source intelligence that can lead to an email or mobile phone number tied to an address.  Criminals will move more communications to encrypted private channels, making their real-world identity harder to determine. The cat and mouse game will continue, and agile bad guys will likely stay steps ahead of good guys bogged down by bureaucratic processes.  The 'Wild West' settles down  It’s a myth that blockchain networks are criminal havens. Reports from Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and blockchain intelligence providers confirm this fact with hard numbers.  No doubt, criminals will increasingly find it easier to hide in the spaghetti code of thousands of legacy systems than in transparent and far fewer blockchain networks.  Finally, the notion that users control their Web 3 identity goes only so far. Individuals, criminal or not, have zero control over public metadata used to determine real-world identities. Databases are building up quickly to tie identities to blockchain addresses. New regulations, such as FATF’s “Travel Rule,” further reduce address privacy by forcing exposure of associated personal identifiable information (PII) data.  In the end, most criminals will lose on both levels, in hiding blockchain transactions and in hiding their real-world identities.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Avivah Litan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/26/criminals-still-find-it-easier-to-hide-in-fiat-than-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66724235abab06d6aa942c33ea5d56474246130a-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411529,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOjxT,1643218275,What Today's Fed Decision Could Mean for Crypto,"At 2:30 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) will discuss the decisions reached during its latest two-day meeting that started yesterday. The announcement will have a huge bearing on the direction of the U.S. economy as a whole. It may have particularly pronounced impacts on both short- and long-term trends for the cryptocurrency industry.  The FOMC is expected to firm up at least two elements of the Federal Reserve’s plans for the year, though both have been broadly telegraphed. There may be more details about the schedule for “tapering” the Fed’s bond-buying program, which more than doubled its balance sheet during the coronavirus pandemic to nearly $9 trillion. The tapering and divestment schedule has significant implications for inflation and capital markets.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But the real headline issue is the potential for change in the Fed’s interbank interest rate. There is very little chance of a hike actually coming out of the current meeting – the Fed has said it needs to begin the asset taper before hiking rates, apparently for technical reasons. But we already have a solid sense of the direction things are going.  The Fed has previously said it plans three rate hikes this year, in response to rising inflation and an incredibly tight job market. Goldman Sachs, apparently seeing even more pressure ahead, predicts four hikes, with rates rising to 2.5% to 2.75% by 2024. The FMOC could provide more clarity on that schedule today.  If the Fed stays the course, it could amount to a dramatic change to the macroeconomic environment. More to the point, it might be perceived as a major change by investors and employers, who would shift their own choices accordingly. Among other impacts, higher Fed interest rates usually draw capital away from speculative sectors because savers and investors are drawn to safer returns in government bonds. At the margins, this will inevitably pull value out of both tokens and crypto startups (along with tech and venture capital more generally).  The question is how much money will move to more conservative positions, how fast it will move and whether the shift is already “priced in” to markets. The likely impact is unclear in part because of the nuances of the current moment, in which even significant interest rate hikes would still leave rates historically low. Fed rates mostly have been near zero since the 2008 financial crisis, only inching up to 2.4% in late 2019 – before being cut again in the face of another crisis. Prior to the 2008 crisis, the Fed rate had not been as low as 2.4% since 1962.  But will investors see the slow march upwards as the end of the post-crisis era of near-free money? The near-zero-interest environment gave rise to perverse phenomena like “The Startup That Loses Money Forever'' – operations like WeWork or Uber that are able to raise funds on the slim chance of future returns in part because more reliable and solid investments just aren’t available. Heading from 0% to 2.5% doesn’t automatically mean the end of the USD silly season, but it will dampen things to some degree.  Crypto companies have only fairly recently joined the ranks of companies able to attract large amounts of mainstream venture capital. So it’s unclear to me just how rough a tumble the more formalized and regulated portions of the sector could see from a broad investment pullback. On the one hand, we may see fewer initial public offerings (IPO) like Coinbase (where the stock is currently more than 40% down from its opening price).  On the other hand, many, many crypto companies are sitting on big war chests, even after the current crash in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). A wild example popped on my radar this morning when SingularDTV, which had an initial coin offering (ICO) in late 2016 (and for a short time employed me at a startup crypto magazine called BREAKER), moved a stash of ETH that’s still worth nearly $30 million. No comment on their treasury management and market timing skills, but they’re far from alone among older crypto startups in having gargantuan ETH or BTC bags with the potential to see them through a stretch of tougher capital markets.  See also: Crypto Is About More Than Prices | The Node  The big X-factor in all of this is the stock market. For better or for worse, the Fed has for nearly three decades consistently moved to protect equity market prices. That is absolutely not part of the Fed’s mandate, which concerns only managing employment and inflation. But former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan seemed so consistent in supporting asset prices with looser money that the tendency became known as the “Greenspan Put.”  It turned out to be a long-term mistake that created instability and bubbles, but the mindset has seemed to persist at the Fed. Though the Fed has denied paying any attention to short-term asset prices, the recent plunge of the U.S. stock market (the S&P 500 is off more than 7% since the start of January) would appear to be at least somewhat of an obstacle to a rate hike. The Fed will still project its future hikes, though, and its paramount need for long-term credibility means it would only change course under truly extraordinary circumstances.  But a continued, steep stock market decline might be one of them. It would be incredibly distressing and a fundamentally bad idea for the Fed to keep the zero-interest orgy going as the real economy recovers from COVID-19, but the possibility can’t be entirely counted out. And if Powell does let it ride, the frothiness has just begun.

Russia's central bank called for a complete ban on crypto in a report last week, citing its volatility and use for illegal activities.  The Bank of Russia's crypto ban call has been opposed by the country's finance ministry on the grounds that it would undermine the industry's technological development.  ""The central bank has its own position.

42375424,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7nqH,1643216072,"Miners Remain Unfazed by Crypto Sell-Off, Expect More M&A","The stocks of publicly traded crypto miners have slumped amid the recent sell-off in bitcoin and the broader market as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates. However, industry participants remain optimistic about the sector’s outlook and see the potential for consolidation among the miners.  Among the crypto-linked stocks, crypto miners are most exposed to the price movements of the digital assets they mine. Given the recent carnage in bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices, some of the stocks have lost more than 50% of their value since their peak last year.  Viridi Cleaner Energy Crypto-Mining & Semiconductor ETF, an exchange-traded fund with heavy exposure to miners, has fallen more than 60% since its November peak. The slide coincided with the price of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, at one point falling more than 50% since its November all-time high. The miners and overall market saw some relief heading into Wednesday’s U.S. Federal Reserve policy statements.  Read more: Fed Preview: How Rate Hikes Could Stimulate Demand for Stablecoins  Moreover, with fear ruling investor sentiment, the access to capital that miners enjoyed last year has somewhat dried up, particularly for the companies that have recently gone public or are planning to do so. Most recently, bitcoin miner Rhodium Enterprises postponed its initial public offering that valued the company up to $1.7 billion due to market turbulence.  “Miners that are more dependent on equity may struggle now because the markets aren’t as bullish as they were,” said Matthew Schultz, executive chairman of bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK).  Furthermore, the Bitcoin network’s hashrate and difficulty recently reached all-time highs, making it harder for miners to earn rewards for validating transactions. Meanwhile, hashprice, a measure of miners' daily revenue per terahash of computing power ($/TH/day), fell near $0.18 from its November peak of around $0.40/TH/day, according to data from Hashrate Index.  However, miners remain unfazed by the crypto market rout as most are still making healthy profits even as bitcoin hovers around $35,000 levels. “The current price of ~$30K does not have a significant impact on the economics of bitcoin mining given that the cost to mine a bitcoin for most industrial scale mining operations in North America is much less than that,” Schultz said.  While the miners that have higher costs are likely making less profit at the current bitcoin price, those profits are still not as low as in the most recent bear market that began in 2018. During that bear market, hashprice hit a floor of $0.07/TH/day according to Juri Bulovic, head of mining at Foundry. Foundry is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which is the parent company of CoinDesk.  “That seemed to be the equilibrium level whereby the highest cost miners became unprofitable and were forced to shut down their operations, and lower cost miners remained operating profitably,” Bulovic noted.  Moreover, the recent correction seems to be less severe than previous major sell-offs, according to Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded miners. In prior bear market cycles there was a 70% decline in the price of bitcoin in 2013 and about an 85% drop in 2018. One reason for this is that the current down market has more institutional investors investing in crypto-linked stocks, which reduces volatility over the longer-term, Thiel said.  Consolidation  To be sure, a prolonged bear market will have some negative impact on the market. The miners who have access to cheap power and newer, more energy-efficient mining computers will be able “rise to the top, while less efficient miners may feel some pain,” said CleanSpark’s Schultz.  Such a down cycle will also change investors' appetite for risky assets, limiting access to capital for public and non-public miners. “In this environment, I think you should expect to see a certain amount of consolidation in the mining space,” said Marathon’s Thiel.  In a relatively young industry with rising competition, expansion is one of the keys for miners to remain profitable. However, with limited access to capital, M&A will likely become more pronounced among cash-strapped miners to fund their growth or production goals. And miners that have orders for new machines but haven’t been able to deploy their rigs yet, as well as companies that don't have the capital to pay for the machines they have already ordered, could become attractive for potential buyers, Thiel said.  CleanSpark’s Schultz echoed Thiel’s assessment, noting that “if prices remain low, we expect to see consolidation surrounding miners that don’t have a sustainable energy strategy and favorable power purchase agreements.”  Buying opportunity?  For longer-term investors, the recent pullback in the stocks of crypto miners might present a buying opportunity, said Wall Street investment banking firm DA Davidson’s analyst Christopher Brendler in a research note.  “We see this as a healthy correction reducing leverage and speculation without overly painful volatility,” he wrote. Brendler added that at their current valuations, crypto mining stocks have “materially better risk/reward” despite investors’ concern about how the companies will fund their growth plans.  “While access to capital to continue investing in growth is a concern, it is so much better now than even just six months ago, and we're optimistic about a near-term recovery in BTC,” Brendler added.  Marathon’s Thiel likewise remains bullish on the longer-term prospect of the mining sector and bitcoin as a whole, despite short-term volatility. “I’m still very optimistic about long-term growth prospects of the industry and bitcoin and for what all the good that bitcoin is going to bring to the world,” he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/26/miners-remain-unfazed-by-crypto-sell-off-expect-more-ma,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f92615fd4194b95abcd742aa08fa223c6ed55fe5-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

U.K.-based mid-tier firm MHA MacIntyre Hudson, announced Jan. 14 its Cayman Islands office, MHA Cayman, now handles the clients of the Cayman-based Moore Cayman firm, Tether's accountant.  As far as Tether's relationship with its accountant is concerned, the change should be insignificant ""other than they're going to see a letter with a different letterhead ... unless for some reason they are going to do something different or provide more services,"" Francine McKenna, founder and editor of The Dig newsletter, said.  “Both [accounting] practices have grown quickly in parallel since 2016 with identical people, services, management and ownership; hence the transition is seamless from both practices’ perspective,” according to MHA MacIntyre Hudson’s press release.  However, the release does not mention MHA MacIntyre Hudson is dealing with some baggage.  MHA MacIntyre Hudson is currently under investigation by the U.K. Financial Reporting Council, the accounting regulator, according to a report published Jan. 7 in the Financial Times.  FRC is looking at MHA's audits of the financial statements of MRG Finance UK for 2018 and 2019, ahead of a planned shakeup of the nation's audit market, according to the FT.

Neither Tether nor the parent company of Moore Cayman have responded to a request for comment from CoinDesk.

42394567,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBklv,1643214813,"What Is Bitcoin? A Beginner’s Guide to Bitcoin Mining, Halving, and Real-World Uses","What is Bitcoin?  Bitcoin is the world’s first successful decentralized cryptocurrency and payment system, launched in 2009 by a mysterious creator known only as Satoshi Nakamoto. The word “cryptocurrency” refers to a group of digital assets where transactions are secured and verified using cryptography – a scientific practice of encoding and decoding data. Those transactions are often stored on computers distributed all over the world via a distributed ledger technology called blockchain (see below.)  Bitcoin can be divided into smaller units known as “satoshis” (up to 8 decimal places) and used for payments, but it’s also considered a store of value like gold. This is because the price of a single bitcoin has increased considerably since its inception – from less than a cent to tens of thousands of dollars. When discussed as a market asset, bitcoin is represented by the ticker symbol BTC.  The term “decentralized” is used often when discussing cryptocurrency, and simply means something that is widely distributed and has no single, centralized location or controlling authority. In the case of bitcoin, and indeed many other cryptocurrencies, the technology and infrastructure that govern the creation, supply, and security of it do not rely on centralized entities, like banks and governments, to manage it.  Instead, Bitcoin is designed in such a way that users can exchange value with one another directly through a peer-to-peer network; a type of network where all users have equal power and are connected directly to each other without a central server or intermediary company acting in the middle. This allows data to be shared and stored, or bitcoin payments to be sent and received seamlessly between parties.  The Bitcoin network (capital “B”, when referring to the network and technology, lower-case “b” when referring to the actual currency, bitcoin) is completely public, meaning anyone in the world with an internet connection and a device that can connect to it can participate without restriction. It’s also open-source, meaning anyone can view or share the source code Bitcoin was built upon.  Perhaps the easiest way to understand bitcoin is to think of it like the internet for money. The internet is purely digital, no single person owns or controls it, it’s borderless (meaning anyone with electricity and a device can connect to it), it runs 24/7, and people who use it can easily share data between one another. Now imagine if there was an ‘internet currency’ where everyone who used the internet could help to secure it, issue it and pay each other directly with it without having to involve a bank. That’s what bitcoin essentially is.  An alternative to fiat currency  Nakamoto originally designed bitcoin as an alternative to traditional money, with the goal for it to eventually become a globally accepted legal tender so people could use it to purchase goods and services.  However, bitcoin’s utility for payments has been stymied somewhat by its price volatility. Volatility is a word used to describe how much an asset’s price changes over a period of time. In the case of bitcoin, its price can change dramatically day to day – and even minute to minute – making it a less than ideal payment option. For example, you wouldn’t want to pay $3.50 for a cup of coffee and 5 minutes later it’s worth $4.30. Conversely, it doesn’t work out great for merchants either if bitcoin’s price falls dramatically after the coffee’s handed over.  In many ways, bitcoin works in the opposite way as traditional money: It is not controlled or issued by a central bank, it has a fixed supply (which means new bitcoins cannot be created at will) and it’s price is not predictable. Understanding these differences is the key to understanding bitcoin.  How does Bitcoin work?  It’s important to understand there are three separate components to Bitcoin, all of which combine together to create a decentralized payment system:  The Bitcoin network  The native cryptocurrency of the Bitcoin network, called bitcoin (BTC)  The Bitcoin blockchain  Bitcoin runs on a peer-to-peer network where users — typically individuals or entities who want to exchange bitcoin with others on the network — do not require the help of intermediaries to execute and validate transactions. Users can choose to connect their computer directly to this network and download its public ledger in which all the historical bitcoin transactions are recorded.  This public ledger uses a technology known as “blockchain,” also referred to as “distributed ledger technology.” Blockchain technology is what allows cryptocurrency transactions to be verified, stored and ordered in an immutable, transparent way. Immutability and transparency are vitally important credentials for a payment system that relies on zero trust.  Whenever new transactions are confirmed and added to the ledger, the network updates every user’s copy of the ledger to reflect the latest changes. Think of it as an open Google document that updates automatically when anyone with access edits its content.  As its name implies, the Bitcoin blockchain is a digital string of chronologically ordered “blocks” — chunks of code that contain bitcoin transaction data. However, it is important to mention that validating transactions and bitcoin mining are separate processes. Mining can still occur whether transactions are added to the blockchain or not. Likewise, an explosion in Bitcoin transactions does not necessarily increase the rate at which miners find new blocks.  Irrespective of the volume of transactions waiting to be confirmed, the Bitcoin is programmed to allow new blocks to be added to the blockchain approximately once every 10 minutes.  Due to the public nature of the blockchain, all network participants can track and assess bitcoin transactions in real-time. This infrastructure reduces the possibility of an online payment issue known as double-spending. Double spending occurs when a user tries to spend the same cryptocurrency twice.  Bob, who has 1 bitcoin, might try to send it to both Rishi and Eliza at the same time and hope the system doesn’t spot it.  Double spending is prevented in the traditional banking system because reconciliation is performed by a central authority. It also isn’t a problem with physical cash because you can’t hand two people the same single dollar bill.  “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending”  Bitcoin, however, has thousands of copies of the same ledger and so it requires the entire network of users to unanimously agree on the validity of each and every bitcoin transaction that takes place. This agreement between all parties is what’s known as “consensus.”  Just as banks constantly update the balances of their users, everyone that has a copy of the Bitcoin ledger is responsible for confirming and updating the balances of all bitcoin holders. So, the question is: How does the Bitcoin network ensure that consensus is achieved, even though there are countless copies of the public ledger stored all over the world? This is done through a process known as “proof-of-work.”  What is proof-of-work?  Computers in the Bitcoin network use a process called proof-of-work (PoW) to validate transactions and secure the network. Proof-of-work is the Bitcoin blockchain’s “consensus mechanism.”  While Proof-of-Work was the first and is generally the most common type of consensus mechanism for cryptocurrencies that run on blockchains, there are others — most notably proof-of-stake (PoS), which tends to consume less overall computing power (and therefore less energy).  Proof-of-work elevates certain network contributors to the role of “validators” – more commonly known as “miners” – only after they have proven their commitment to the network by dedicating an immense amount of computing power to discovering new blocks — a process that typically takes approximately 10 minutes.  When a new block is discovered, the successful miner who found it through the mining process gets to fill it with 1 megabyte’s worth of validated transactions. This new block is then added to the chain and everyone’s copy of the ledger is updated to reflect the new data. In exchange for their efforts, the miner is allowed to keep any fees attached to the transactions they add, plus they’re given an amount of newly minted bitcoin. The new bitcoin created and handed to successful miners is known as a “block reward.”  All Bitcoin users have to pay a network fee each time they send a transaction (usually based on the size of it) before the payment can be queued for validation. Think of it like buying a stamp to post a letter.  The goal when adding a transaction fee is to match or exceed the average fee paid by other network participants so your transaction is processed in a timely manner. Miners have to cover their own electricity and maintenance costs when running their machines all day to validate the bitcoin network, so they prioritize transactions with the highest fees attached to make the most money possible when filling new blocks.  You can view the average fees on the Bitcoin mempool, which can be likened to a waiting room where unconfirmed transactions are held until they are selected and added to the blockchain by miners.  How is bitcoin created?  The Bitcoin network automatically releases newly minted bitcoin to miners when they find and add new blocks to the blockchain. The total supply of bitcoin has a cap of 21 million coins, meaning once the number of coins in circulation reaches 21 million, the protocol will stop minting new coins. In a way, Bitcoin mining doubles as both the transaction validation and the bitcoin issuance process (until all the coins are mined, then it will only function as the transaction validation process.)  Importantly, increasing the amount of computing power dedicated to bitcoin mining will not mean more bitcoins are mined. Miners with more computing power only increase their chances of being rewarded with the next block, so the amount of bitcoin mined remains relatively stable over time.  The Bitcoin network uses a coin distribution strategy known as “bitcoin halving” that ensures the amount of bitcoin distributed to miners reduces over time. By gradually decreasing the supply of new bitcoin entering circulation, the idea is it will help support the asset’s price (based on the fundamental principles of supply and demand.)  A bitcoin halving (sometimes called a “halvenings”) happens every 210,000 blocks or roughly four years. When the bitcoin protocol first launched in 2009, each successful miner received 50 bitcoin (BTC) as a block reward. Fast forward to 2021: Block rewards are now 6.25 BTC, a reduction from 12.5 BTC prior to the bitcoin halving in May 2020.  In April 2024, Bitcoin underwent its fourth “halving,” cutting the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This event, hardcoded into Bitcoin’s software, occurs roughly every four years and reduces the rate at which new bitcoins are created. It’s one of the core features designed to preserve Bitcoin’s scarcity.  As of early 2025, more than 19.7 million BTC are in circulation, leaving just over 1.2 million left to be mined over the next 100+ years. However, taking into consideration the halving principle and other network factors like mining difficulty, it’s estimated the last bitcoin will be mined sometime around the year 2140.  “As computers get faster and the total computing proof-of-worker applied to creating bitcoins increases, the difficulty increases proportionally to keep the total new production constant. Thus, it is known in advance how many new bitcoins will be created every year in the future.”  How to mine bitcoin  Bitcoin mining is a process that adds transactions to the blockchain and mints new Bitcoin. It involves solving complex mathematical problems using powerful, specialized computer hardware. There was a time in history when it was reasonable to mine bitcoin from your own home, but as the computational hardware requirements have grown, most people entering the space will typically join a mining pool, which is a group of miners pooling resources for greater efficiency.  Miners utilize hardware—often Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)—to solve these problems. This process is competitive; the first to solve the problem adds the next block to the blockchain and receives a Bitcoin reward.  Bitcoin mining is not easy. It's extremely energy-intensive, leading to high electricity costs and substantial heat generation so cooling solutions are a must-have for mining hardware. There's also a substantial upfront investment in equipment, and profitability isn't guaranteed due to the volatile nature of Bitcoin's price and the ever-increasing mining difficulty. Lastly, regulatory scrutiny or bans in certain regions due to environmental or other concerns can pose challenges, so always check local laws before starting. Despite the risks, Bitcoin mining can be potentially profitable for those with the right setup and understanding of the risks.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  What is a bitcoin wallet?  A bitcoin wallet is a software program that runs on a computer or a dedicated device that provides the functionality required to secure, send and receive bitcoin. Counterintuitively, the bitcoin itself is not stored in a wallet. Instead, the wallet secures the cryptographic keys — essentially a very specialized type of password — that proves the ownership of a specific amount of bitcoin on the Bitcoin network.  Anytime a bitcoin transaction is executed, ownership of the bitcoin transfers from the sender to the recipient, with the network designating the recipient’s keys as the new “password” for accessing the bitcoin.  Bitcoin uses a system called public-key cryptography (PKC) to preserve the integrity of its blockchain. Originally used to encrypt and decrypt messages, PKC is now commonly used on blockchains to secure transactions. This system allows only individuals with the right set of keys to access specific coins.  There are two types of keys required to own and execute bitcoin transactions: A private key and a public key. Both keys are strings of randomly generated alphanumeric characters used to encrypt and decrypt transactions. On the bitcoin network, PKC implements one-way mathematical functions that are easy to solve in one way and almost impossible to reverse.  The blockchain uses the one-way mathematical algorithm to create a public key from the private key. With this, it is practically impossible to regenerate the private key from the public key, meaning you’d better not lose your keys (or forget your password to access them). Also, you will receive a public address, which is simply the hashed or shorter form of your public key.  This address functions similarly to a house address and is shared to receive bitcoin. On the other hand, the private key must be kept hidden from prying eyes, just as your debit card’s PIN is meant for your eyes alone.  To execute transactions, you are required to use your private key and public key to encrypt and sign your Bitcoin transactions. Also, you have to include the public address of the recipient. With this, only the recipient with the right private key can unlock or claim the transferred bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb12c46130372d2c8db092b83551e82563e39e0d-1508x1131.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Railgun protocol has deployed on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, with Solana and Polkadot launches soon to follow. Railgun has also announced plans to add non-fungible token (NFT) support in the coming weeks.  Railgun brings zk-SNARKs to the primary layer of Ethereum, meaning that the protocol can remove identifying information from a transaction even while interacting with smart contracts and DeFi platforms, which would be particularly useful for professional traders and asset managers.  The $10 million investment from DCG continues a longstanding bet on privacy applications in the transparent-by-design world of public blockchains. DCG has also backed privacy tokens Zcash and Horizen.  “Through a collection of smart contracts that verify zero-knowledge proofs, the Railgun team has built a privacy system directly on Ethereum and other Layer-1 protocols, from which you can interact with decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and popular smart contract applications,” Matt Beck, director of investments at DCG, said in a statement. “Railgun fills a clear gap in the market, and solves the privacy problem that everyone who uses crypto will come across.”  As part of the partnership, DCG has acquired and staked over $10 million of Railgun’s native RAIL token and donated over $7 million in stablecoins to the project’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) treasury. DCG has also devoted resources through mining and staking subsidiary Foundry Labs to ensure that Railgun’s back end is strong enough to endure high demand.  “It’s very new to have a large investor send funds to a fully decentralized DAO treasury in support of a project, without any admin key or multisig team,” attorney Edward Fricker, who advised on the deal, said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | BNB,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/26/railgun-aims-for-private-defi-with-10m-backing-from-dcg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7653e0fc203cea8c3f67803781fa29910633e81d-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375442,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7oEB,1643211590,How Bitcoin Contributions Funded a $1.4M Solar Installation in Zimbabwe,"South Africa's Sun Exchange, a solar power investing community that uses bitcoin (BTC) to raise capital and to make payments to its investors, says it has completed the highest value crowdsourced project of any kind in Africa.  The Nhimbe Fresh project in Zimbabwe, a grower of berries and vegetables comprising 250 smallholder farmers, raised funds for about $1.4 million worth of solar cells, bought by more than 1,905 individuals across 98 countries, with most of them transacting in bitcoin.  Sun Exchange deployed the first bitcoin-funded solar project back in 2016, which was presented at CoinDesk's Consensus event in New York that year. Sun Exchange has now funded more than 50 solar projects, raising over $9 million, and it's one of the few ambitious projects from the early days to still be around and thriving.  Read more: Blockchain Startup Sun Exchange Raises $1.6 Million in New Seed Funding  ""These projects are mainly in schools, farms, supermarkets and retirement homes, many of them in South Africa,"" Sun Exchange founder Abe Cambridge said in an interview. ""These are organizations which otherwise wouldn't have the capital available to build their solar plant, nor would they really want to go and raise debt.""  'Virtuous spiral'  Sun Exchange's proposition provides a baked-in carbon offsetting component for environmentally conscious bitcoiners. (Projects like Filecoin Green have been looking at ways to meld carbon offsetting into crypto.)  In fact, there are parallel philosophies of democratization behind both cryptocurrency and solar, enabling access to finance and energy, Cambridge said.  ""A beautiful sort of virtuous spiral happens when you invest bitcoin into solar,"" Cambridge said. ""It takes about 320 megawatt hours of electricity to mine one bitcoin. But when you use that bitcoin to buy into solar energy, those generation assets you've just purchased with your one bitcoin will produce 3.6 gigawatt hours. So, over 10 times more energy.""  Sun Exchange allows any investor to own solar power assets, which are typically panels on roofs, which then earn back a yield over a 20-year lease period. The yield in South African rand (ZAR) is then converted into bitcoin for payment to the wallets of international investors.  Read more: One Man's Mission to Deploy Solar-Powered Bitcoin Nodes Across Africa  A system of dollar cost averaging, a way of smoothing out bitcoin's price volatility by buying the cryptocurrency over time, is employed by the project to boost contributors’ yield potential.  ""BTC payouts are done monthly against the spot ZAR/BTC price at the time. So if BTC price drops by half one month, you would earn twice as much BTC over that if the BTC price had stayed the same as the prior month. As the BTC price recovers, that price gain acts to boost the value of accumulated BTC,"" a Sun Exchange spokeswoman told CoinDesk by email.  And there are other virtuous elements in this circle, such as the hardening of energy security, reliability and access in emerging markets, Cambridge said. The Zimbabwe project has a battery storage element in case of any vagaries relating to the national grid, while South Africa, where many of the platform's solar projects are based, experiences periodic rolling blackouts.  Sun Exchange also recently kicked off the crowdsale for the Karoo Fresh project, the first system to be completely off-grid.  ""For me, it seems like a tragic waste of energy if the value of bitcoin is not put to good use like this,"" Cambridge said. ""The fact that we actually built a portal to help unlock that value and good which bitcoin can do is I think why we’ve got the traction in the market that we have.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/26/how-bitcoin-contributions-funded-a-14m-solar-installation-in-zimbabwe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48061e3bde51bba80ef50d313c141e3262fad4cc-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407261,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUfaC5,1643211480,Don’t Let Web 3 Repeat Web 2’s Mistakes,"Crypto has undergone an impressive spate of growth recently. We’ve gone from a few hundred users of non-fungible tokens (NFT), a couple of thousand Ethereum node operators and maybe a multitude more of bitcoin holders to several million investors and users across the industry. It’s wonderful there’s an open online world where anyone can create, build and explore without permission. That value is being created, and freedom preserved. But there’s something being lost in the mix: privacy.  Web 3, the buzzy corner of crypto that spans everything from play-to-earn gaming to collectibles to decentralized finance (DeFi), seems to be repeating the same missteps of Web 2. Although touted as a solution to the perils of internet centralization by letting people own their own data and earn rewards for the value they create, Web 3 is failing on these big promises. And with some of the biggest Web 2 builders entering the Web 3 space, the problems may only get worse.  Tor Bair is the founder of the Secret Foundation, an organization dedicated to building, researching and scaling adoption of open-source, privacy-first technologies. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Privacy Week series.  The Web 2 economy was built on a simple idea: collect a cheap resource at scale, user data, then repackage and monetize access to it as an expensive product. It gave users near unlimited ability to create content and connect globally while giving advertisers a captive audience. Companies including Facebook and Google built trillion-dollar businesses and “walled gardens” around this arbitrage, then changed their names (Meta, Alphabet) to distance themselves from the extractive platforms that allowed for their obscene growth.  Along the way, user privacy was not merely ignored – it was abandoned. It was only after the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blowers came forward that we truly became aware of how our data was being misused and resold, occasionally at the expense of democracy itself. Almost every Web 2 company has dealt with massive privacy failings and data breaches, from Uber to Equifax to LinkedIn to Alibaba.  Despite all the lofty promises of Web 3, it has not solved this core issue. While the blockchain world is indeed far more open than Web 2, it is actually far less private. Blockchains leak all user data by default, and not just to Cambridge Analytica but to anyone who glances at the blockchain. The dominant public-by-default model means users must give up control of their data by default as well.  This failure means Web 3 is not becoming user-centric after all. Public-by-default systems and blockchains recentralize and converge to winner-take-all structures. Whoever has the resources to make best use of all the publicly available data will capture the majority of value. In other words, the rich get richer, and users lose their control.  Web 3 companies like Chainalysis have achieved multi-billion- dollar valuations on this play. Miners, the computers that secure and order blockchains, routinely frontrun users based on their privileged view into publicly available data.  Meanwhile, Web 2 companies like Meta (the former Facebook) are clearly seizing the next multi-trillion dollar opportunity by concentrating their entire focus on the emerging metaverse. The same companies that shattered online privacy in the age of social media are now angling to control our open metaverse, wielding war chests of billions of dollars in hopes of capturing trillions.  These are two bad choices: an open metaverse that leaks all data by design and a metaverse owned and operated by the same companies that routinely exploit user data. We need to actively reject both.  See also: The Metaverse Needs a Constitution | Opinion  As we watch the metaverse emerge and build its foundation, we must be aware of and actively work towards a better model. Web 3 and the open metaverse must embrace privacy by design, protect users by default and allow them to consent to and benefit from the use of their data.  It’s not just a dream: Tens of thousands of users in our community around the world are already building and using private-by-default, decentralized, and self-sustainable applications that are truly empowering. We’ve been working towards this vision since 2015, and with the stakes higher than ever, this is the perfect moment to join our fight.  A metaverse that protects our privacy is the only one worth creating, and the only one worth living in.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH,Tor Bair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/26/dont-let-web-3-repeat-web-2s-mistakes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4df5304790e4dce6ab24de57505f4c981b8b565e-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394554,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBjhF,1643211154,Why TVL Matters in DeFi: Total Value Locked Explained,"Total value locked (TVL) is the overall value of crypto assets deposited in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol – or in DeFi protocols generally. It has emerged as a key metric for gauging interest in that particular sector of the crypto industry.  TVL includes all the coins deposited in all of the functions that DeFi protocols offer, including:  Staking  Lending  Liquidity pools  Importantly, it doesn't reflect the yield that these deposits are expected to earn. It only means the current value of the deposits themselves.  A project’s TVL doesn't only change when users make new deposits or withdraw their assets. It is constantly changing in line with the fluctuating dollar value of all those assets in the cryptocurrency market. Some or even all of a DeFi protocol's deposits may be denominated in its native token. When its native token appreciates in value, the protocol’s TVL grows in tandem.  Investors can look at TVL when assessing whether a DeFi project’s native token is valued appropriately. The market cap of the token may be high or low relative to the TVL of the project. The more extreme the relationship, the more overvalued or undervalued the token may appear.  The combined TVL of all DeFi protocols grew exceptionally fast between 2020 and 2021. At the start of 2020, the combined TVL across all DeFi platforms was around $630 million, according to analytics firm DeFi Llama. More than half of that was in one protocol, MakerDAO. That particular project grew to about $241 billion by the end of 2021.  MakerDAO remained one of the largest protocols, along with others such as Curve and Aave. By the end of 2021, these had more than $10 billion in TVL each.  Protocols can operate on just one network or spread themselves across many, in which case they have an independent TVL on each of the networks. The largest network by DeFi TVL is Ethereum, accounting for almost half of the total volume worldwide.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MKR,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/why-tvl-matters-in-defi-total-value-locked-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8adc506e700ccb762841fc373a5d40904500d1bd-2120x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394560,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBk1l,1643211134,What Does It Mean to Burn Crypto?,"“Burning” crypto means permanently removing a number of tokens from circulation. This is typically done by transferring the tokens in question to a burn address, i.e. a wallet from which they cannot ever be retrieved. This is often described as destroying tokens.  A project burns its tokens to reduce the overall supply. In other words, it creates a ""deflationary"" event. The motivation is often to increase the value of the remaining tokens since assets tend to rise in price whenever the circulating supply falls and they become more scarce.  In a similar way, algorithmic stablecoins automatically mint new tokens and burn them frequently to maintain their dollar-pegged value. For example, if demand for the stablecoin rises and the price diverges above its dollar peg, the protocol’s smart contract will automatically issue a number of new tokens to bring the price back down, and vice versa.  Burning tokens can be similar to a company buying back its shares. The company “returns the value” to its shareholders in this way. Crypto projects burn their tokens to achieve the same goal.  The price of the token does not necessarily increase overnight when the burn takes place. Sometimes, other news about the token can overwhelm the impact. Alternatively, investors may know a token burn is going to happen and ""price it in"" at an earlier point. Even so, in the long run, burning tokens tend to support an asset’s price and is considered a positive move.  Read more: Binance Destroys 1.6M BNB Tokens in First-Ever Auto Burn  Burning tokens can also benefit those staking tokens to validate transactions in a proof-of-stake protocol. When a large chunk of tokens are removed from circulation, there’s a likely chance they’ll receive a higher U.S. dollar value from their staking rewards.  Some projects have regular burning events built into their code. The aim here is to reassure potential investors that the future supply of the token will continue to shrink, calming concerns of inflation or an overly diluted market. As a result, this practice can also add to the appeal of a token as a ""store of value.""  The Terra project, for example, burned 88.7 million of its LUNA tokens in November 2021. The tokens represented around $4.5 billion in value at the time, which the company said made the event one of the largest layer 1 token burns ever. The move was passed by a vote in the Terra community. The LUNA token set a new record high price in the following days. The purpose of the burn was partly to remove value from Terra’s community pool, where founder Do Kwon argued it was not needed. In a sense, the burn transferred value from the pool to individual holders of the token.",POSITIVE,LUNA | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LUNA | TRADING | BNB,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-does-it-mean-to-burn-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40d6d2588f344cae253127f82fb9610e777a06aa-2124x1411.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394559,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBkC1,1643211110,What Happens When All Bitcoin Are Mined?,"The supply of bitcoin is limited to a final cap of 21 million. This is determined by bitcoin’s source code which was programmed by its creator(s), Satoshi Nakamoto, and cannot be changed. Once all bitcoin is mined, the amount of coins in circulation will remain fixed at that level permanently.  The main implication of approaching and ultimately reaching bitcoin’s supply cap will be that mining will become far less profitable. But the process will be drawn out over more than a century.  Bitcoin miners will still be rewarded at that point, but only through transaction fees and not from newly minted coins.  Read More: Can You Still Mine Bitcoin and Other Crypto From Home?  Almost 19 million or 90% of bitcoin have already been mined since the cryptocurrency was launched in 2009. Even so, the final bitcoin will likely not be minted until some time around 2140, according to current estimates.  The rate at which new bitcoin are mined is geared to slow down over time. The reward for mining each block of bitcoin – which is done every 10 minutes – halves every 210,000 blocks. That’s roughly once every four years. As of 2022, the reward per block had diminished from its initial reward of 50 BTC per block in 2009 to just 6.25 bitcoin.  Read More: Bitcoin Halving, Explained  Mining was relatively quick at first: half of the 21 million possible bitcoin had already been mined by late 2012, according to research firm Messari. In 2021, issuance slowed down a great deal and less than half a million BTC were mined during the whole year.  Reaching the supply limit will likely push up the price of bitcoin, provided that demand for it continues to grow. This is because anyone wishing to purchase bitcoin will need to source it from another person, giving sellers control over its price.  Even when all bitcoin are mined, much fewer than 21 million will be circulating actively. Data analytics firm Chainalysis estimates that roughly a fifth of all coins mined to date are lost. That means those bitcoin are stuck in wallets with lost keys, which could be due to lost passwords, the physical loss of hard drives where those keys were stored or even stuck in wallets belonging to deceased owners who never passed on the passwords necessary to access them.

You can now display your NFTs as profile photographs on the Twitter social network, which are viewable and verifiable across the internet. After testing, Twitter announced this last week. NFTs are in the limelight, with companies like Twitter attempting to capitalize on the expanding popularity of this type of digital art. These collectible works of art are expensive and popular. You&apos;re not looking for a unique and precious JPG or GIF file, but you&apos;re purchasing the right to brag about being the legal owner of that digital art. As a result, those expensive NFTs are employed as a standing image, potentially increasing the toxicity of social networks. That isn&apos;t to suggest that NFT technology isn&apos;t important or that it shouldn&apos;t be part of the internet&apos;s long-term future. NFTs would be useful in future metaverses where people could want to buy and trade-specific digital items while also proving their ownership and legitimacy. How to Get Started? You can mint (produce) NFTs or buy them online and clearly label them as Twitter profiles. You&apos;ll need to authenticate that you have an iPhone or iPad, as only iOS supports Twitter NFTs.

42407259,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUfaFO,1643209218,What Is Zcash? The Privacy Coin Explained,"In a world where our personal information, interests and activities are being increasingly tracked and documented, it’s little surprise cryptocurrencies that offer users anonymity continue to remain popular despite efforts from regulators and exchanges to restrict their accessibility.  In a 2021 Big Brother Brands report, companies like Uber and Meta (formerly Facebook) were found to harvest between 56.41% and 79.49% of their users’ personal information, respectively. If the controversial Meta-backed diem digital currency successfully launches to the masses (big IF,) Meta will inevitably gain access to its users’ transaction data. This means not only will the tech giant know who you are and what you like, but it will also know what you buy and how much you spend.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  Zcash is one of the leading digital currency blockchains that looks to address this snowballing issue and seeks to return power and privacy to its users.  What is Zcash?  Zcash is a privacy-focused, blockchain-based payments network that uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to shield transactions, making the contents of a transaction private even on a public blockchain. Born out of the Zerocash protocol, Zcash forked from the Bitcoin blockchain in 2016. Its native token, zcash, uses the ticker symbol ZEC.  Read more: What Are Privacy Coins and Are They Legal?  ZKPs are the product of a cryptographic technique that dates back to 1980. They allow two parties to verify information with each other without sharing the underlying data related to this information. For example, you can prove that you are over 21 years old without having to reveal your actual date of birth (or any other extraneous information that some forms of identification, like your driver's license, might contain).  The Electric Coin Company (ECC), which created Zcash, added Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, or “zk-SNARKs” to the ZKP toolkit.  This cryptographic advancement basically allows shielded Zcash transactions to be fully encrypted on the blockchain while still allowing the transaction to be verified as valid by the network's consensus.  With Zcash, there are two types of addresses:  Transparent addresses: Transactions with transparent addresses, or t-addresses, can be tracked on the Zcash blockchain the same way Bitcoin’s can.  Shielded addresses: Shielded addresses, or z-addresses, are encrypted, meaning you aren’t able to see the data on the blockchain so transactions sent to them aren’t visible, nor are the amount of funds z-addresses hold.  If a t-address sends funds to a z-address, observers won’t be able to tell where they went. If a z-address sends a transaction to another z-address the transaction is entirely shielded from prying eyes, offering one of the most private and secure options on the market.  How Zcash has changed in recent years  Since its fork in 2016, Zcash has continued to iterate on the core services it offers and expand on them. Some big improvements over the last couple of years include Halo, a “trustless recursive” version of ZKPs; the release of an open-source, shielded-first, fully functional Zcash wallet in 2020; and the Heartwood Network Upgrade activation, also in 2020, which added Shielded Coinbase and FlyClient support.  Not to mention an increase in institutional support and the first-ever Zcash halving.  Halo and Halo 2  Zcash launched Halo in 2019, a new zk-SNARK that addressed two criticisms the privacy coin faced: scalability and trusted setups.  Zcash was launched with a trusted setup. A trusted setup creates a secret number, and a derivative of that number is used by the Zcash protocol. This number is created in multiple parts by multiple actors. They all must then destroy what’s known as “cryptographic toxic waste” without revealing what it was. A trusted setup would have had to occur at each hard fork.  But if no one destroys that waste through intentional planning, or if the secret number is figured out, then it would provide a fundamental flaw in the protocol and even allow the individual(s) that discovered it to create Zcash tokens arbitrarily without anyone’s knowledge.  The Zcash Multi-Party Computation Ceremony, in which a trusted setup was executed, was recorded on YouTube and even made an appearance on NPR’s Radiolab.  Halo eliminated the need for a trusted setup and the “cryptographic toxic waste that went with it.  As CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey wrote at the time of the Halo announcement:  “Halo allows a user to both prove that no one involved in the initial establishment of a large-scale, zero-knowledge proof system has created a secret backdoor with which to later amend the code and that that secure state has existed over the course of ongoing updates and changes to the system. Until now the risk of fraud at setup meant that zero-knowledge proofs often required elaborate, costly procedures at the outset to instill confidence in users.”  A trusted setup made zero-knowledge proofs, which are still fairly nascent, bulky and somewhat impractical for actions other than proving one-off individual facts.  Read more: EY Releases Zero-Knowledge Layer to Tackle Increasing Ethereum Costs  “To be sure, one-off trustless solutions known as ‘bulletproofs’ have been around since 2017, but they lack the recursive quality needed to verify the ever-accumulating information within a large, growing, changing database,” wrote Casey.  Halo improves on ZKPs and allows them to compress any amount of data into a short proof that can be checked quickly, according to Steven Smith, director of engineering at ECC. The removal of a trusted setup is a key “step toward our Scalability 2021 initiative,” said Smith in an email.  Halo 2, announced in 2020, iterated on Halo by using PLONK, a novel z-SNARK, rather than “Sonic” to verify transactions. PLONK is more efficient than Sonic, and would better enable further scaling of Zcash as well as move it closer to being able to eliminate a trusted setup.  At its heart, PLONK is an instance of a proof that can verify itself, “allowing any amount of computational effort and data to produce a short proof that can be checked quickly,” according to the Halo 2 blog post.  Zcash Wallet  In December 2019, Zcash started the development of its ECC Reference wallet, a light client reference wallet that let shielded transactions in Sapling (an upgrade that enabled significant efficiency improvements for shielded transactions) work on mobile devices. This reference wallet was a blueprint ECC hoped others would take up and build upon, while providing additional feedback.  Then, in June, ECC released an open-source, shielded-first, fully functional Zcash wallet that showcases its software development kit (a collection of software development tools in one installable package) for demonstration and testing.  One goal was “making sure at least 40% of the world could read and understand the ECC reference wallet,” said Smith. With the help of the community, the app was translated from English into five languages: Simplified Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Italian and Korean.  “Additionally, and due in large part to the work on our SDKs, Unstoppable became the first multi-currency wallet to enable shielded Zcash support on iOS and Android,” said Smith.  Heartwood Network Upgrade  In July 2020 ECC launched the Heartwood Network Upgrade activation, which added Shielded Coinbase and FlyClient support. Shielded Coinbase allowed Zcash users to have completely shielded ZEC from its creation, increasing privacy further. It also gave miners the option to get mining rewards issued immediately into a z-address. Luxor and Poolin, two mining pools that represent nearly 40% of Zcash mining hash power, have implemented shielded Coinbase.  FlyClient provides a more efficient method for “light-client block-header verification” or verifying the blocks on a blockchain, and could increase the utility and market for Zcash. FlyClient enables light client use-cases and a class of cross-chain interoperability efforts like tZEC, an Ethereum-compatible ZEC token.  Zcash Halving  Zcash underwent its first halving at the tail end of 2020, triggering a cut in miners’ block rewards from 6.25 ZEC to 3.125 ZEC, and launched the network’s fifth upgrade, Canopy, which did away with the controversial “Founders Fund,” which some members of the Zcash community felt gave too much ZEC tokens back to the founders.  Instead, 8% of mining rewards will now be allocated to the Major Grants Fund, managed by the Major Grants Review Committee (MGRC), which will be made up of a community-nominated five-member committee. The fund will fuel development and adoption efforts, separate from the work being done by the ECC and Zcash Foundation.  Halo Arc Update  ECC announced the next suite of upgrades to Zcash – Halo Arc.  Halo Arc includes updates to Zcashd (Zcash’s consensus node), an ECC wallet prototype and the ECC wallet software development kits (SDKs). The wallet will enable shielded-by-default transactions, something that is merely optional for Zcash right now.  After a number of delays, Halo Arc is set to launch on April 18, 2022, in coordination with the activation of Zcash’s Network Upgrade 5 (NU5). NU5 will be the first mainnet activation of the Halo proving system, furthering the development of zero-knowledge-proof cryptography.  Read More: Zcash Announces 'Halo Arc' and Timeline for Protocol Privacy Update  The protocol upgrade will also introduce unified addresses, a feature that creates a single Zcash address that is compatible across all Zcash value pools, including shielded and transparent ones so that users no longer have to juggle multiple address types. At present, protocol upgrades at times required new address formats.  Issues to overcome  Zcash has a few challenges to overcome.  “Like with all cryptocurrencies, there could be vulnerabilities or issues that we’re unaware of,” said Josh Swihart, VP of Growth at ECC. “Though the likelihood of an exploit is probabilistically nil, for some, Zcash’s trusted setup is a risk.”  The hope is a larger implementation of Halo 2 in 2022 will be able to do away with trusted setups and eliminate the “toxic waste” that is a byproduct of them.  “Zcash will also need better scalability if it is to be used for global payments by billions of people,” said Swihart.  Finally, there is the delisting of privacy coins such as Zcash from some exchanges that could continue to be an issue. Core privacy features built into protocols like Zcash and Monero have caused concern among regulators and policymakers due to their ability to conceal illicit activity. Cryptocurrency exchanges Shapeshift and BitMEX are among those that have delisted ZEC (as well as XMR and DASH), allegedly due to regulatory pressure. At the same time though, in September 2020, cryptocurrency exchange Gemini was the first exchange to allow users to withdraw Zcash with its anonymizing feature.  “Since the release in September, 11.8% of Zcash withdrawals on Gemini were sent to shielded addresses,” read Electric Coin Company’s 2020 recap of Zcash.  “In terms of what we haven’t progressed on as fast as we would have liked, we had hoped to have made more progress on shielded hardware wallet support,” said Smith.  The future of Zcash  Zcash’s Halo and Halo 2 developments offer the best opportunity for the privacy coin to address some of its most prominent criticisms. But the potential for privacy coins to be delisted by exchanges doesn’t appear to be decreasing and looks to be an ongoing forest to navigate. But when it comes to privacy coins, and previous contenders like Dash who have all but abandoned the label and protections, Zcash is squarely in the conversation of the top privacy coins and will continue to march ahead as such.  Transition to proof-of-stake  On Nov. 19, 2021, ECC announced plans to migrate Zcash away from its proof-of-work consensus mechanism based on the equihash algorithm to a more energy-efficient and interoperable staking-based system.  The CEO of ECC, Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, floated the idea of such a transition in a blog post earlier that year, citing the change would “[eliminate] the downward pressure on the price of ZEC and [add] additional utility for ZEC.” He was referring to the current situation where Zcash miners are forced to sell an amount of the coins they mine to cover running costs, serving to suppress the price of ZEC.  Furthermore, staking would provide additional utility and allow more users to participate in validating transactions on the network in exchange for rewards. Not to mention, the significant energy-reducing benefits of switching to PoS would make Zcash a more environmentally friendly project than it currently is.  No specific date has been given for the rollout of this transition, though ECC stated it is expected to occur sometime within the next three years.",POSITIVE,ZEC,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MINING | ZEC | FORKS,"Benjamin Powers, Ollie Leech",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/26/what-is-zcash-the-privacy-coin-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/287745cdd234252e406c006964a7c61aaec81220-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The approval allows Gemini Galactic to operate an alternative trading system (ATS), which will facilitate the trading of “digital asset securities,” Gemini said, adding that such assets are subject to U.S. securities laws, like traditional stocks and bonds are, and therefore can be bought and sold only through a licensed broker-dealer.  John Reinhardt, director of custody operations at Gemini, said it remains to be seen exactly what kind of offerings digital asset securities will include. “These securities will initially include private placements and, as the market matures, may include public offerings as well,” Reinhardt said in an email to CoinDesk.  Return of the security token?  Back in 2016 and 2017, tokenized securities and security tokens were all the rage as believers said they would trade on regulated ATS venues and revolutionize existing market infrastructure. A couple of years on, it could be argued the action has moved elsewhere, mostly around cryptocurrencies flowing on public blockchains and non-fungible token (NFT) applications.  But Gemini Galactic appears to be biding its time. The company said it’s “excited to be a first mover” and to help further develop this market.  “The growth of the digital asset securities market and the use of blockchain for securities infrastructure will depend on further clarity from regulators and additional investment by companies such as Gemini,” Reinhardt wrote in the email. “Once there are real use cases, the market will be able to grow, and we are excited to be a pioneer in this space.”  Gemini initially made its broker-dealer application to self-regulatory body FINRA in mid-2019. To date, the exchange, which is owned by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has gathered an impressive clutch of licenses, approvals and regulatory nods across its trading and custody divisions.  “Our primary regulatory license is with the NYDFS [New York State Department of Financial Services] for Gemini’s custody and exchange business. We hold other state and federal licenses, where necessary, to operate throughout the United States, and we are registered or our registration is pending to offer our services in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including in Asia and Europe,” Reinhardt said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/26/winklevoss-owned-gemini-galactic-snags-finra-broker-dealer-approval,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1b3f8bb84a1a8c71bb769fe984ba29e9812655b-1500x903.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375439,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7oAP,1643202000,Money Laundering Picks Up Steam on DeFi Protocols: Chainalysis,"Money laundering through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols is gaining popularity with cybercriminals, according to new research from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.  Cybercriminals laundered at least $8.6 billion in cryptocurrency in 2021, the firm said in research published Wednesday – a 30% jump in money laundering activity from 2020. Decentralized protocols received 17% of crypto sent by illicit addresses last year, up from a mere 2% in 2020.  And DeFi is not the only crypto-related money laundering method on the rise: Mining pools, high-risk exchanges and mixers also received an increased amount of crypto from wallets tied to criminal activity last year. However, Chainalysis’ research suggests the largest group of crypto criminals still prefer to launder their money the old fashioned way, through centralized exchanges.  Centralized exchanges received nearly half of all crypto sent by cybercriminals in 2021. Nearly half of the 8.6 billion worth of crypto laundered went through centralized exchanges last year; of that, 58% went to just five trading platforms, pointing to a growing concentration of services.  Kim Grauer, Chainalysis’ director of research, highlighted a growing dichotomy between the types of cybercrime that are gaining in popularity (i.e., scamming vs. theft) and where the funds end up.  “People tend to think of cryptocurrency crime as being one thing, but it couldn’t be more varied. It couldn’t be more different in the way that criminals use [crypto] and have a digital footprint over how they manage money,” Grauer told CoinDesk.  Crypto obtained through theft, which is more technically challenging and more often taken up by organized groups – including North Korea-affiliated hacking groups, which stole $400 million in crypto last year – is substantially more likely to be laundered through DeFi protocols and mixers.  Read more: North Korean Hackers Stole $400M in 2021, Mostly in Ether  “There are certain types of criminals in particular that lean into technological advancements more quickly,” Grauer said. “North Korea is always the first to use a new kind of tech solution for laundering money. We follow them each year, and this year they've used a lot of mixers. Last year they were using DeFi.”  Scammers, however, are more likely to use centralized exchanges. According to Chainalysis’ report, this “may reflect scammers’ relative lack of sophistication.”  In the coming year, Grauer and her team expect to see an uptick in crypto crime involving non-fungible tokens (NFT).  This year “is already off to a big start for NFT crime,” Grauer said, pointing to the rise in wash trading on NFT platform LooksRare. “This is definitely going to continue.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MINING | TRADING | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/26/money-laundering-picks-up-steam-on-defi-protocols-chainalysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6823ee53e8d1886751981d929b60dfe6ddf594e-4476x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Mizuho forecasts the crypto exchange had trading volume of about $525 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, up around 60% sequentially, implying revenue of about $2 billion. This is relatively in line with consensus, the analysts wrote.  For the first quarter, the bank sees “significant downside to consensus revenue expectations,” and if current trends persist, the company could fall short of earnings estimates, analysts led by Dan Dolev wrote.  The bank lowered its Coinbase medium-term estimates to reflect “pressure on crypto end-markets and persistent take rate pressure.”  Further bitcoin appreciation, crypto market volatility and the success of new revenue streams are potential upside risks to the bank’s price target. Downside risks include pricing compression and the threat of a so-called crypto winter, during which the market cap of cryptocurrencies shrinks and volatility falls, the report said.  Coinbase shares traded at an all-time low of about $162.54 on Monday, tracking weakness in the crypto market, before rebounding to close at $191.48.

42410939,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtT1z,1643200200,‘Ethereum’ vs ‘Eth 2’: What’s in a Name?,"The Ethereum Foundation announced in a blog post that it is nearly time to put an end to “ETH2” and the nomenclature that seems to separate the proof-of-stake chain from the proof-of-work chain. While it made sense when Ethereum’s roadmap looked to build out a separate proof-of-stake chain and simultaneously destroy the proof-of-work chain as we know it, the roadmap now involves a Merge between Eth 1 and Eth 2, pairing the current execution (application) layer on the proof-of-work chain with the consensus layer of the Beacon Chain.  In the foundation’s own words:  Eth 1 → execution layer  Eth 2 → consensus layer  Execution layer + consensus layer = Ethereum  So much focus on the terminology for the technical specifications of Ethereum may seem like overkill. However, making the large distinction between Ethereum 1.0 and Ethereum 2.0 can be confusing, leaving some everyday users wondering if Ethereum 2.0 will come with a new token or if they will have to migrate their balances to a new chain and plenty of other implications that scammers would love to use to their advantage.  Additionally, it will only become more inaccurate to refer to the execution and consensus layers as separate versions of Ethereum the closer we get to integrating the two layers.  If you are interested in taking a stroll through the history of Ethereum, I recommend reading the March 28, 2021, edition of Ben Edgington’s What's New In Eth2. Ben breaks down how Eth 2 came to be and how changes in the roadmap have made naming clarity nearly impossible over the years.  As we move closer to the Merge (fingers crossed for early this summer) and Eth 2 and Ethereum become synonymous, we at CoinDesk will also begin to step back from using Eth 2 without additional context. Instead, we will follow the Ethereum Foundation’s lead in referring to it primarily as the consensus layer.  Welcome to another issue of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  Popular cross-chain bridging application Multichain was hacked for over $3 million in user funds. BACKGROUND: Cross-chain bridging continues to be one of the riskier subindustries in DeFi, especially as demand for alternative chains grows. As users look to import non-native tokens to other layer 1 platforms, bridging contracts will take on more and more risk. The DeFi industry looks to developers to find better solutions for layer 1 cross-chain bridging.  An OpenSea bug allowed attackers to purchase NFTs at old listing prices and immediately sell them for profit. BACKGROUND: While users may have changed or increased their listing prices, old listings still existed at the blockchain level. Listings are only unapproved once they are canceled or expired, leaving several NFT holders exposed for attack and wondering why their NFTs sold below market value.  The chain split on Kintsugi, Ethereum’s proof-of-stake test network, has been resolved and finality was restored. BACKGROUND: Marius van der Wijden released a fuzzer on the test network to battle-harden it for future user activity; this caused a three-way chain split between execution clients Geth, Besu and Nethermind, which were also followed by two of the consensus side clients as well. Ethereum-facing teams stepped back to watch the chain split instead of immediately addressing the problem, thereby gaining further insight on how to react to future issues on mainnet.  Ether issuance from block rewards fell below that of bitcoin, as a result of EIP 1559. BACKGROUND: The non-technical excitement around EIP 1559 was the possibility that transaction fee burns would offset the native asset’s inflation. Block rewards are an important mechanism to financially incentivize miners and validators to secure the chain in good faith. The fee burn allows the network to continue paying block rewards in perpetuity without worrying about alienating ether holders and block space consumers via inflation.  Factoid of the week  Open comms  Valid Points incorporates information and data about CoinDesk’s own Eth 2.0 validator in weekly analysis. All profits made from this staking venture will be donated to a charity of our choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.

The Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF will invest at least 80% of its net assets in securities of firms that derive a minimum of 50% of their profit from bitcoin mining, according to a filing with the SEC Wednesday.  Following the SEC's reluctance to approve a spot bitcoin ETF, asset managers and investment firms have turned to products offering exposure to the futures market or companies that are themselves exposed to bitcoin in other ways, such as mining or holding crypto on their balance sheets.  Valkyrie's miners ETF is similar in composition to one from VanEck, which applied to the SEC to launch a digital asset mining fund in December.  In October, Valkyrie won SEC approval to win SEC approval to list a bitcoin futures ETF, as did ProShares and VanEck.  The proposed fund will charge a management fee of 0.75% and incorporate both U.S. and non-U.S. companies, including some in emerging market countries as defined by the FTSE Emerging Index.

The company will use the funds to diversify its collection and add art projects of ""varying scope and scale, ranging from full-production genesis drops to curated multi-artist projects united along a common theme, to large-scale editions that integrate shared learning and direct access to artists into the collecting process,"" the statement said.

42423815,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gyTh,1643194604,Dogecoin Leads Gains in Major Cryptos Ahead of Fed Meeting,"The broader crypto market recorded its second day of growth ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve statement on Wednesday. Prices of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other major cryptocurrencies rose as much as 7% in the past 24 hours, with meme coin dogecoin (DOGE) leading gains among the biggest assets by market capitalization.  Terra's LUNA tokens were among the only losers, posting a 4.6% decline, data from analytics tool CoinGecko showed.  Wednesday’s Fed meeting may reveal the bank's stance on the timing of an interest rate increase that many observers expect will come in March.The Fed has said it will tighten monetary policy with up to four hikes this year to keep inflation in check, prompting a sell-off in asset markets across the globe during the last few months. Bitcoin fell as much as 25% in the past month, while the crypto market has lost upward of $1 trillion in market capitalization in the same period.  Some analysts say a tightened policy could see investors flee into safer assets, which could, in turn, lead to a further drop in cryptocurrency prices.  “If the regulator tightens its rhetoric and announces the upcoming rate hike as early as March, all risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, could suffer significantly,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior financial analyst at FxPro, said in an email to CoinDesk.  Bitcoin held above $37,000 in European morning hours on Wednesday after dropping to under $33,500 on Monday, a move that caused the majors to fall as much as 25% at the time. The market has since recovered, with bitcoin, solana (SOL) and ether rebounding to last week’s price levels.  Tokens of some layer 1, or base, blockchains led gains outside of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Polygon (MATIC) and near (NEAR) have surged over 11% in 24 hours as investor demand rebounded after Monday’s drop.  Prices of MATIC were buoyed by the appointment of ex-YouTube gaming head Ryan Wyatt as CEO of Polygon Studios, a development lab that supports the creation of blockchain games and non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Polygon network. Wyatt previously led YouTube's virtual- and augmented-reality projects and is expected to structure partnerships and investments in the Polygon ecosystem.  Some traders said a correlation between crypto prices and risky assets such as technology stocks exists as they share a similar set of investors.  “Crypto is owned by the same people that own growth stocks,"" Haseeb Qureshi, founder of crypto investment fund Dragonfly Capital, said in a telephone interview. ""When they start cutting risk, they cut back on crypto. That’s how the correlation is built.”  Cause for concern may be short lived. There are ""lots of reasons to believe that the secular macro rate of interest is still low. Interest rates are low because of incremental technology growth.

42423805,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gyDh,1643194476,This Taiwanese Fintech Wants to Bridge the World Using Stablecoins,"Taiwan’s financial sector is known for its conservative outlook and rich pools of foreign reserves – the fifth-largest in the world at $546 billion for a country of 24 million.  Thanks to its conservative outlook and strict regulatory environment, Taiwan isn’t considered a regional financial hub like neighbors Hong Kong and Singapore. Taiwan is better known for its technology manufacturing giants, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).  The government wants to change that perception.  A pillar of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen’s 2017 election campaign was the ""New Southbound Policy"" to encourage diversification of exports away from China to Southeast Asia, and the expansion of other parts of the economy such as financial services.  That's where XREX, a Taipei-based TradeTech fintech that closed a $17 million round in August, wants to step in.  Given Taiwan’s strong U.S. dollar holdings and the dollar shortfall in many Southeast Asian countries such as India, XREX wants to build bridges between countries for business remittances, with the backend powered by stablecoins including USDC, DAI and USDT.  “Taiwan is not known globally for exporting its financial sector, but Taiwan is known for its robust domestic banking industry,” Wayne Huang, XREX’s CEO and co-founder, told CoinDesk in an interview. “So far, the banking industry hasn’t been able to export the industry to emerging markets, and we want to change that.”  Among XREX’s investors is Taiwan’s National Development Fund (NDF), a sovereign wealth fund that allocates capital for technological innovation and economic diversification.  “The government feels that there’s not been enough effort to export financial services,” said Huang, mentioning that fintech and firms incorporating blockchain technology are areas of interest for the NDF.  One of XREX’s first target markets is India, which has capital controls on the amount of outbound remittances a person or entity can send per year, which leads to a dollar shortfall in-country and headaches for businesses looking to pay vendors abroad.  India has a large diaspora in Canada, where XREX was recently granted a Money Services Business license from Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, or FinTrac, the country’s national financial intelligence agency.  “There’s been very good regulatory clarity from the Canadian regulators. They have made everything very clear, and we know exactly what’s expected from us,” Huang said. He said XREX uses crypto forensics suite CipherTrace to augment its anti-money laundering (AML) efforts.  Taiwan's regulatory abyss  But this same regulatory clarity doesn’t exist in Taiwan, Huang told CoinDesk. The company has registered and had some initial conversations with the Taiwanese financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Commission, and Huang said the regulator hasn’t shown much interest.  This is because XREX builds financial pipes between countries, without touching the Taiwanese banking system or using Taiwan’s currency. Capital between Canada and India, for example, would be on-ramped with local currency in the respective countries, then sent between them as a stablecoin. Most of the company’s clients aren’t Taiwanese, and it doesn’t offer services in China.  Taiwan’s hands-off approach to non-Taiwanese currency activity in its banking system might have been why stablecoin issuer Tether called the nation home for many years before being cut off by its correspondent banking partners in 2017 (Tether unsuccessfully sued Wells Fargo, its erstwhile partner, to restore access and provide an explanation.) Huang said XREX’s U.S. dollar partners have already audited the operation and are OK with it.  “I’m optimistic that in a few years there will be crypto-specific licenses in Taiwan. We want to apply for these licenses, and we want regulators to be familiar with XREX. We are looking forward to the government making available some type of license for us to apply,” Huang said.  Until a Taiwanese license is available, Huang told CoinDesk, XREX plans to keep on applying for other licenses around the world as it expands its business. Next up is Singapore, where XREX is applying for a Major Payment Institution license, which would allow it to conduct money transfers and offer digital payment token services to Singapore residents.  “We want to be a regulated entity,” he said.",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | USDT | USDC,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/26/this-taiwanese-fintech-is-building-dollar-liquidity-pipes-with-usdc-dai-and-tether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb01e75532ca61e9fd90408560cd36fa05bb074c-3543x2362.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423810,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gyPh,1643191452,Wonderland’s TIME Sets Low of $420 After Liquidation Cascade,"Wonderland’s TIME token slid to a record low on Wednesday, falling as much as 40% in 24 hours to just under $420 in Asian hours.  TIME has lost 95% of its value from its November peak of $10,000, becoming one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies in the past few months during a broader decline that saw bitcoin, ether and other major cryptocurrencies reach prices last seen in mid-2021.  Theories in crypto circles behind the sell-off included Wonderland developers selling part of their holdings and the unwinding of positions of overleveraged traders.  Liquidations occur when a trader has insufficient funds to keep a leveraged trade open. While these mainly happen on futures products, investors lending their cryptocurrencies on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications – in return for yields – are subject to liquidations when protocols automatically sell holdings if prices of staked assets drop below a threshold. This, in turn, causes prices to fall further, creating a ‘liquidation cascade.’  Wonderland’s TIME tokens are backed by a basket of assets issued over the Avalanche blockchain, giving the tokens an intrinsic value. TIME is what the platform calls “money” – a wholly decentralized means of value backed by liquidity provided by the platform’s users.  Wednesday’s plunge saw developers conduct a $5 million buyback during the Asian morning. “Looks like the bots and limit orders ran out of funds. I’m replenishing now and just did a $5mm buyback,” Wonderland developer Sifu wrote in a post on the project’s Discord channel.  The previous buyback occurred earlier this month, when TIME prices fell to under $830 from $1,400. Several millions of dollars worth of the tokens were bought by Wonderland developers to bring prices above their intrinsic value at the time, as reported.  Meanwhile, some blockchain sleuths pointed out that Wonderland’s chief developers took on millions of dollars in losses after the sell-off. Sifu’s wallet saw $1.6 million of losses due to liquidations, while those on Daniele Sestagalli’s wallet reached $15 million.  TIME price recovered in European morning hours, and was trading above $610 at the time of writing.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/26/wonderlands-time-sets-low-of-420-after-liquidation-cascade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/486fdc542ec4531f8a666f9dba65dc4d30eec80f-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

FTX US, the crypto trading giant’s stateside wing, on Wednesday said it raised $400 million at an $8 billion valuation – one of the industry’s largest Series A rounds. Its eponymous parent company commanded a $25 billion valuation in October.  The staggering sum adds fuel to one of the U.S. crypto industry’s fastest-growing brands. The exchange’s now 1.2 million-strong user base traded $67 billion in spot crypto last year as average daily volume spiked 608%, according to statistics shared with CoinDesk.  The exchange entered the U.S. market in May 2020, and now has a 24-hour trading volume of $255.5 million, according to data from CoinGecko.  Much of that growth came as the trading juggernaut made massive business development and partnership bets – especially in sports.

The timing for this crossover couldn&apos;t have been more perfect. The pandemic widened the gap between fans and sports clubs. It was challenging to develop activities to spur fan engagement on a digital platform. Even the football clubs were in a tough spot, albeit over 2.5 billion fans worldwide. To overcome these challenges and delight fans with new experiences, clubs began pursuing new ventures in the crypto space. Some of the wealthiest football clubs in the world, including Barcelona, AC Milan, Manchester City, and PSG, jumped on the crypto bandwagon and launched a limited supply of fan tokens through blockchain launchpads. Meanwhile, the superstars of these clubs went on to make record sales in the NFT landscape. Football World Is Fully Embracing the Crypto Paradigm With no platform enabling digital fans to interact with their favourite football club or player actively, they had only stayed spectators of the game for a long time.

42423811,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gyNh,1643183142,"Fake Grimacecoin Jumps 285,000% After McDonald’s’ Tesla Joke","A token created after a McDonald’s joke tweet surged as much as much 285,641% in a few hours as opportunistic actors jumped at the chance to make cash in a tepid crypto market.  “Only if Tesla accepts grimacecoin,” McDonald’s said on Wednesday morning, referencing its purple mascot fashioned after a taste bud. That tweet was in response to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s tweet on Tuesday, “I will eat a happy meal on TV if Mcdonald’s accepts Dogecoin.”  While McDonald’s hasn’t pivoted to a crypto token company yet, Wednesday’s tweet spurred the creation of nearly 10 grimacecoins on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network alone.  Anyone can call a smart contract and issue tokens on the BSC (or other blockchains) for a few cents, and the presence of decentralized exchanges means tokens can instantly be issued, supplied with liquidity and traded soon after. The premise doesn’t matter: if there’s money to be made peddling trendy topics; expect a market for it somewhere in niche ""shitcoin"" circles.  One such grimacecoin token started trading at $0.0007 and reached $2 at its peak in Asia morning hours before tumbling down to the $0.60 level.  That token reached a market capitalization of nearly $2 million at peak prices. It was worth $800,000 at press time and has over $65,000 in a liquidity pool created and supplied by users. Blockchain data, however, shows 93% of these tokens are owned by a single entity.  Another grimacecoin – with a supply of 1 trillion tokens – reached a $1 million market cap during morning hours in Asia as prices jumped to $0.00000193 from a tiny fraction of a penny just hours earlier. This grimacecoin locked up $104,000 in liquidity at the time of writing, with 75% of that held by one address.  Grimacecoins weren’t limited to the BSC network. An Ethereum-based grimacecoin surged 56,000% in the hours after its issuance. It reached 1,000 holders, and a $6 million market capitalization, with developers positioning it as the “first” one on the Ethereum network.  Not all grimacecoins saw similar successes, however. One exhibit on the BSC, presumably late to the fray, failed to attract both capital and speculators, holding just over $830 in liquidity with five holders and a market capitalization of $1,400.  The crypto market is equal parts legitimacy and memes. Serious investors and developers build financial services based on smart contracts to allow global users to trade, lend assets and take out loans in a permissionless setting, in line with the ethos of relying on technology instead of third parties to access financial services.  There are then the meme artists. Dog coins, cat coins, food coins and meme coins command billions of dollars in market capitalization, data shows, each iteration savvier than the rest.  Grimacecoin isn’t the only instance of crypto hopefuls creating a shitcoin market. In December, U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) joked about a “mongoose coin” in a hearing about cryptocurrencies, spurring the issuance of hundreds of mongoosecoins in the hours afterward.  The most successful mongoosecoin from that cohort saw trading volumes of over $15 million in the week after its issuance, reaching a market capitalization of tens of millions of dollars in the process. Prices have since fallen 95%.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/26/fake-grimacecoin-jumps-285000-after-mcdonalds-tesla-joke,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f16533798cecc7e06cb9cb2e4a3ad5fe3beb00fd-2120x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Christopher Giancarlo has joined Digital Asset’s board of directors and will advise the smart contracts-focused provider of software and services for financial services on a range of blockchain issues.  According to a Tuesday press release, Giancarlo will provide guidance to Digital Assets’ leadership on “asset tokenization, distributed ledger technology (DLT) advancement and the regulatory and monetary developments impacting [the cryptocurrency] space.”  Affectionately called “Crypto Dad” by many in the cryptocurrency industry for his crypto-friendly stance as a regulator, Giancarlo has held a number of positions in the crypto industry since leaving the CFTC in 2019.  Earlier this month, Giancarlo joined crypto venture capital firm CoinFund as a policy adviser. He is currently senior counsel at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, and co-founded the Digital Dollar Project in January 2020. Giancarlo confirmed his appointment to the board, saying he was excited to be involved with a core blockchain technology provider..  “I’ve had a 38-year career, only five of which were spent as a regulator,” Giancarlo said. “I think my value proposition with the companies I work with is much broader than just regulation.”  In an email to CoinDesk, Digital Asset Chief Financial Officer Emnet Rios said that every one of the company's board member brings ""a unique experience across financial services and technology industries."" She said Giancarlo ""fills a gap with a specific focus on distributed ledger technology and asset tokenization, and with his legal and regulatory background, he was a natural fit to join our board.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/26/ex-cftc-chair-chris-giancarlo-joins-digital-assets-board-of-directors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6e28ada322e3a683023593173af4c067462e10c7-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423808,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2gyJh,1643163669,Diem Mulling Sale of Assets to Pay Back Investors: Report,"The Diem Association, the Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook)-led group seeking to create a stablecoin, is considering the sale of the project's assets to return money to investors, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.  The group has been speaking with investment bankers about selling Diem's intellectual property and helping the developers of Diem technology find new places to work, Bloomberg reported, citing its sources.  Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had high hopes for the cryptocurrency, defending the vision of the project before a congressional hearing, but the initiative has had a rocky journey since its unveiling in June 2019 as the Libra Association.  In December 2020, the Libra Association rebranded as Diem to distance itself from its original goals.  Originally, the project envisioned a stablecoin backed by a basket of fiat currencies, one that could be used worldwide as a means of exchange. It immediately prompted international regulatory backlash, with lawmakers demanding that all development cease until they could better understand it, provide some level of regulatory oversight and ensure there were no risks to financial stability.  In May, Diem said it would be partnering with Silvergate Bank to launch a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. Diem Networks U.S., a subsidiary of the association, would run the Diem Payments Network and register as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), while Silvergate would be the formal issuer of the diem USD stablecoin. Silvergate would also manage the reserve backing the token.  Novi (formerly Calibra), a Meta subsidiary focused on building a wallet that would be compatible with Diem, announced a pilot program in partnership with Paxos last autumn. Lawmakers pushed back against even this scaled-down project.  But the Federal Reserve expressed concerns about this plan and wouldn't guarantee that it would give its approval.  Last November, Libra project creator David Marcus announced he was leaving Meta.
