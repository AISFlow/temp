Bitcoin miners MARA Holdings (MARA), CleanSpark (CLSK) and Hut 8 (HUT) booked 25%-30% gains.  MicroStrategy (MSTR), the Nasdaq-listed software company with the largest corporate bitcoin treasury, melted up 25%, closing the day at a new all-time high price of $340, overcoming its 24-year old record from the dotcom bubble era.

We are nearing my price targets, with Fibonacci extensions suggesting Bitcoin could reach $102,000, implying a potential 50% rally from current levels. Implement a strategic exit plan by scaling out at key price targets, monitoring momentum indicators, and considering historical cycle patterns post-halving. Despite being a long-term Bitcoin bull, I am downgrading from Strong Buy to Buy and may further downgrade to Sell as targets are met. Thesis Summary All eyes are on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), the world’s premier cryptocurrency, as it makes new all-time highs and breaks above the $80,000 level. Crypto enthusiasm is reaching a fever pitch, and we are getting close to the targets I laid out years ago. With everyone palpably excited to own and buy Bitcoin, it’s time for the pragmatic investor to begin to take some profit. Be fearful when others are greedy. In my last article, I discussed why Bitcoin was due for another rally as liquidity conditions improved . However, as we fast approach my price target I am beginning to consider exiting. It's still early, but for this reason, I am downgrading to a Buy. Below, I lay out my exact price target for Bitcoin and my strategy for exiting. The Blow-Off Top We currently have a blow-off top-developing in Bitcoin. Crypto has been a well-known part of the Trump trade for some time, but even crypto enthusiasts may be surprised by just how rapidly everything is mooning. Bitcoin is making new all-time highs, and this time it’s not alone. Altcoins are also catching a bid, with meme coins like DOGE ( DOGE-USD ) leading the way. Miners are having double-digit gains and MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) seems not to know what a red day is. The excitement is not only palpable but measurable. BTC Interest (Google Trends) The number of Bitcoin searches has exploded since early October. Crypto Fear And Greed Index (Alternative.me) We can also see that the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index has now entered extreme greed, though we are still not quite at maximum greed levels, with a score of 76. Now that Bitcoin has no resistance above, I expect we could continue to rally perhaps as much as 25% from here in a matter of weeks. Still, in terms of the broader crypto cycle, we are definitely getting close to the end. Bitcoin Price Targets I’ve had some clear price targets for Bitcoin over the last year, and while we’re not quite there, we are very close. Bitcoin weekly chart (TrendSpider) We’ve zoomed out to Bitcoin’s weekly chart to see things clearly and simply. There are three key things to point out. Firstly, we have the Fibonacci extensions of the decline from the previous cycle's Bitcoin top to the bear market bottom. Note that the 1.618 extensions, what is often referred to as the golden ratio, projects us towards $102,000, which is now around 30% away from today’s price. Secondly, we have a green trendline going from the previous two tops, which we can see actually intersects with the 1.618 ext. In fact, this intersection from a time perspective could happen in the next 2-3 months. Lastly, Bitcoin has made a very clear five-wave impulse since its November lows, with a final wave 5 now seemingly confirmed and underway. Let’s zoom into this wave 5. Bitcoin daily chart (TrendSpider) We’ve now also measured the decline in wave 4 which we can see in the first chart. What’s very interesting, is that we get some significant overlap in the fibs at both $90,000 and then $100,000. The 1.618 ext on the more micro level projects us towards $89,000 which is also where the 1.236 ext of the larger decline, projects us. This would be, in my opinion, an initial point of reversal, and would likely mark the top of wave 3 in this final impulse to new highs. Ultimately, though, I expect we will get very close to $100,000 at least. When Should You Sell Bitcoin? Here’s the thing, though, price targets are just that. We can’t know exactly how things will pan out. However, PT is a key element in developing a strategy and exit plan. There’s an argument to buy and hold some Bitcoin forever, that’s also part of the strategy, but if you got into Bitcoin near the lows, you may soon be looking at a 7x return. Nothing wrong with taking some profit. Here are three indicators/strategies to consider when building your Bitcoin exit plan. Scale-Out At Key PT BTC PT Exit Strategy (TrendSpider) Using our PT from above, we can build a price range within which we want to begin selling. I personally like to scale out by having a few limit orders ready as we make our way up. For example, we could consider selling around 50% of our position Lastly, we can let our “core” position of 20% ride much higher or even hold it forever. This strategy is shown above with a sell-zone triangle, which illustrates how to slowly sell and de-risk your position Bail-Out As Momentum Fades Bitcoin EMAs (TradingView) Another option is to wait for a much more clear signal of momentum fading. For example, back in 2021, selling when the 20-week EMA crossed below the 50-week EMA would have saved a lot of pain. Notice also that this coincided with a huge divergence in the weekly RSI. Bitcoin RSI divergence (TrendSpider) We have a similar set-up today. This is another indicator that momentum is slowly waning, and often an early warning sign of a sell-off. Timing Is Everything BTC LT Cycle (TradingView) Lastly, if we look at Bitcoin’s history since its inception, we can clearly see that Bitcoin tends to top around 12-18 months after the halving event. The last halving took place on April 19, 2024, which means that, if history repeats, then Bitcoin would likely top between April and August of 2025. So, one could also commit to selling around this period. With that said, the fact that this is a well-known cycle means we could see it pre-empted to an extent, not unlike the pre-emptive rally we saw before the halving this time. Risks Bitcoin has a lot of tailwinds, with liquidity increasing and institutional adoption. But we still have to deal with a lot of volatility. Furthermore, if the economy enters a recession, I think Bitcoin will fall with the rest of the market. In this regard, higher inflation and possibly higher long-term rates could also derail the Bitcoin narrative. If we saw a bearish cross of the EMAs before our PT is reached, then we would have to reconsider our strategy. Final Thoughts In conclusion, I continue to be a long-term Bitcoin bull. However, we can’t deny that this is an asset that is volatile, moves in cycles and will sell off hard if liquidity conditions worsen. This is now a good time to begin taking some profits and think about an exit strategy, not the time to go all in. For this reason, I am downgrading from Strong Buy, to Buy, and will likely downgrade even further to a sell as we reach my price targets.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4736158-bitcoin-almost-time-to-sell-rating-downgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36138758.jpeg

36138203,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652503,1731364232,Dogecoin To As High As $23? This Pattern Could Hint So,"An analyst has pointed out a historical Dogecoin pattern that could suggest DOGE might see a bull run to as high as $23 this time around. Dogecoin Could Be About To Go Parabolic According To This Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about where Dogecoin could be going next based on the pattern that has been observed during previous bull markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holder Profits Now 121%: How Much Higher Can BTC Go? Below is the chart shared by the analyst, which shows how DOGE has recently once again been showing a familiar trajectory in its monthly price. From the graph, it’s visible that Dogecoin had been trading inside a Descending Triangle pattern during the last few years, but the coin appears to have found a break above it recently. The Descending Triangle is a pattern in technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, looks like a triangle slopped downwards. Generally, the bottom line of the triangle provides support to the asset’s price, while the top one can be a source of resistance. A break out of either of these lines can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. Thus, escapes out of the upper level, like the one that the memecoin has seen recently, can lead to a bullish outcome. As Martinez has highlighted in the chart, this isn’t the first time that Dogecoin has seen a long-term phase of consolidation inside a Descending Triangle. It would appear that the previous two such patterns also saw the cryptocurrency achieve breaks to the upside. Both of these breaks led to sharp bull runs for the coin, so it’s possible that the latest surge in the price is the start of something similar. As for how high DOGE might be able to go this time, the analyst has referred to Fibonacci levels. These levels are based on different ratios from the popular Fibonacci series. The first bull run topped out around the 1.618 Fibonacci level, which corresponds to the famous golden ratio that’s found in many natural formations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be Ready For ‘Phase 2’ Of This Historical Bull Pattern The second one saw the cryptocurrency go through a larger jump, with its top being situated around the 2.272 level as measured from the top of the last bull run (corresponding to 1.000). Based on these tops, Martinez believes that the top of the next Dogecoin bull run might lie somewhere between the two levels. Relative to the last bull run top, the 1.618 lower cutoff of the range translates to around $3.95, while the upper 2.272 one to about $23.26. If Dogecoin can manage to touch even the first of these targets, its price would have seen growth of over 1,310% from where it’s today. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.285, up 86% over the last seven days.

The latest surge in Bitcoin’s price follows former President Donald Trump’s recent election victory, which has ignited bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. With renewed optimism in the air, analysts predict that this could be the start of a significant upward trend, with Bitcoin potentially breaking the six-figure barrier before the end of 2024. The demand for high-risk assets like Bitcoin has soared post-election, as investors see it as a powerful hedge against economic uncertainty and an alternative to traditional assets. Trump’s victory is seen by many as a positive development for the crypto market, with expectations of more crypto-friendly policies and regulatory clarity that could pave the way for innovation and growth. This environment of optimism has led to increased buying activity and record trading volumes, pushing Bitcoin to new heights. According to Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, the recent price movement indicates that traders are positioning themselves for a major price breakout. Lee points out that rising volatility in the derivatives market, combined with the stablecoin market cap now hovering around $160 billion , has created conditions for leveraged investments, which could accelerate Bitcoin’s rise. This liquidity, paired with strong demand, might propel Bitcoin to $100,000 within months. Trump’s administration, combined with a Republican-controlled Senate, could also provide a supportive environment for cryptocurrencies. Many crypto advocates view this Senate as one of the most pro-crypto in U.S. history, with figures like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong calling it the “most pro-crypto Congress ever.” This political shift has led to optimism that regulatory measures will encourage rather than restrict the crypto industry, promoting blockchain innovation and providing a safer, more attractive space for U.S.-based crypto companies to operate. Andrey Lazutkin, Chief Technology Officer at Tangem Wallet, echoes this sentiment, stating that a Republican-led Senate could prioritize policies that encourage growth in the digital asset space, enabling companies to operate with more confidence and fewer regulatory constraints. Adding to this momentum, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. are seeing substantial inflows, contributing to Bitcoin’s recent price gains. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF alone recorded a remarkable $1 billion in trading volume within minutes of the election results. This strong inflow underscores the increasing demand for regulated investment options in Bitcoin, making it more accessible to institutional investors and retail traders alike. The convergence of these factors—political optimism , regulatory support, increased institutional interest, and the liquidity surge in stablecoins—suggests that Bitcoin’s path to $100,000 is becoming more realistic with each passing day. Many analysts believe that if the current momentum continues, Bitcoin could very well achieve this milestone before the end of the year, marking a historic moment in the cryptocurrency world. For investors and crypto enthusiasts, this period represents a potential turning point. The belief in Bitcoin as a reliable store of value and a hedge against inflation is strengthening, especially as global economic uncertainties persist. With mainstream adoption growing through vehicles like ETFs and the promise of a favorable regulatory environment, Bitcoin’s role in the financial system appears more secure than ever. As Bitcoin approaches $100,000 , this rally has become about more than just price. It signals increasing confidence in digital assets as part of the future economy. For the crypto community, the next few months could be pivotal, as Bitcoin’s upward trajectory hints at a transformative period for the entire industry.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-of-88k-,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36166030.jpeg

36134175,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652558,1731358804,Dogecoin Price To $1 Soon? Textbook Weekly Golden Cross Shows What’s Coming Next,"The Dogecoin price could be gearing up to reach the coveted $1 All-Time High (ATH) as the meme coin has just displayed a rare technical indicator known as the Textbook Weekly Golden Cross. Kevin, the crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) who identified this Golden Cross on the Dogecoin chart, predicted that the pattern could set off a price rally toward the $1 mark. Golden Cross Sparks $1 Target For Dogecoin Price The world’s largest meme coin, Dogecoin, has just completed the “Textbook Weekly Golden Cross“ for the first time in four years, signaling that higher prices are likely ahead. The Dogecoin price has been on a major bullish momentum this month, and recent price movements suggest that the cryptocurrency is poised for an even greater price rally. According to Kevin, a Golden Cross typically occurs when the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) crosses above the 200-day SMA on a chart. This 50 MA represents the average price of a cryptocurrency over a shorter term, while a 200 SMA indicates a price average over a longer term. More often than not, during a Golden Cross formation, the shorter-term average moves above the longer-term average, which is usually considered a bullish signal that indicates a possible price uptrend. For the Dogecoin Textbook Weekly Golden Cross, the analyst has suggested that the meme coin could see greater upward momentum to new highs around the $1 price target. Kevin shared a price chart Depicting Dogecoin’s steady rise to new ATHs. With the Dogecoin price currently trading around $0.28, the analyst has highlighted several bullish targets for the meme coin, with some even surpassing the $1 target. Currently, at the 0.618 Fibonacci level, the Dogecoin price is projected to surge to the 0.73838 Fibonacci level at $0.8. Additionally, the meme coin is expected to rise steadily towards the 1.0866 Fib between $0.95 and $1.1. Notably, the crypto analyst disclosed that the last time the Dogecoin price experienced a Textbook Weekly Golden Cross was in 2020, during the previous crypto bull run. Kevin revealed that Dogecoin experienced a dip for weeks during that time, followed by a substantial rally to new ATHs. As a result, the analyst has urged investors to stay cautious, especially in the short term, as Dogecoin could display some volatility or experience a dip before moving upwards. Analyst Says Golden Cross To Drive DOGE Even Higher In another X post, crypto analyst Milkybull Crypto also announced that a Golden Cross has occurred on the Dogecoin weekly chart. However, instead of a $1 price target, the analyst has set a bullish target between $2 and $4 for Dogecoin. The analyst is confident that this bullish price prediction is possible this cycle, as Dogecoin has historically undergone what he describes as ”life-changing rallies“ when this Golden Cross occurs. Currently, the price of Dogecoin is trading at $0.28, marking a 23.24% increase in just one day and an 84.66% surge over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap.

36130205,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652552,1731353434,Bitcoin Data Reveals Bulls Are Growing But Still Behind March 2024 Peak – Details,"Bitcoin has proven unstoppable, breaking all-time highs five times in six days and surging past the $82,000 mark. This latest milestone cements Bitcoin’s momentum as it pushes into uncharted territory, capturing the bulls’ attention and sparking new levels of optimism in the market. According to recent data from CryptoQuant, the number of bullish investors is growing rapidly, yet there’s reason to believe Bitcoin’s rally is far from over. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sees Altseason Potential As BTS Is Still Outpacing ETH – Time To Buy Altcoins? CryptoQuant’s insights indicate that BTC remains significantly below its March 2024 peak in several key metrics, which suggests that Bitcoin may still have room to climb within this cycle. This gap highlights that, despite the impressive gains, Bitcoin could still be building toward a true cycle peak, with potential gains yet to be realized. As investor sentiment strengthens and Bitcoin shows resilience at each new level, the market watches closely for signs of continued upward momentum. The next few days will be crucial in determining just how far Bitcoin can go as it solidifies its place in the next phase of this bull run. Bitcoin Bulls Enter The Room Bitcoin bulls have returned after eight months of sideways consolidation and significant selling pressure. With Bitcoin now trading 11% above its previous all-time high from March, market sentiment has turned decisively bullish, marking the start of a new trend. According to data from CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, the number of bullish investors in the market is steadily rising, signaling growing confidence. However, despite this uptick, the current rally lacks the frenzied demand seen during the March 2024 rally, when both retail and institutional interest reached euphoric levels. Adler’s data indicates that while bulls have a strong foothold in the market, the pace of accumulation by new retail and institutional participants is still relatively modest. This gap between the current market dynamics and those seen in March suggests that Bitcoin’s latest surge may be just the beginning rather than the end of its upward trajectory in this cycle. Related Reading: Cardano Skyrockets Over 40% – Funding Rate Suggests Further Upside The slower but steady rise in buying interest could indicate that Bitcoin is still in the early stages of this bullish phase, with room for further growth before reaching a cycle peak. For investors, this could present a promising opportunity. The subdued retail and institutional excitement level suggests that Bitcoin has yet to capture mainstream attention as it did during previous peaks. If demand rises gradually, Bitcoin may experience sustained growth over the coming months, potentially reaching new highs as momentum builds. BTC Setting New High Bitcoin recently set a new all-time high above $82,000, which many investors previously viewed as a likely local top. However, BTC’s price action remains robust, and it may be too soon to call for a definitive peak. Despite this upward momentum, a potential pullback to $77,000 could be on the horizon, as there is an unfilled gap in the CME futures market between $77,000 and $81,000—a technical level that often attracts price action as traders look to close the gap. This week will likely bring significant volatility as bulls control the market. With Bitcoin in uncharted territory, some investors may seize the opportunity to lock in profits, which could introduce selling pressure. Related Reading: Avalanche Nears Breakout – Top Analyst Sets $420 Target For AVAX This Cycle Nonetheless, the dominant trend is bullish, and a brief correction to $77,000 could provide a foundation for further upside. Bitcoin’s strength remains intact for now, but all eyes will be on how it responds to the volatility and whether it can maintain this high range or dip slightly before resuming its climb.

36126025,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652577,1731348005,"Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Set To Skyrocket 2,500%, Predicts Renowned Economist","Renowned economist Henrik Zeberg has released a technical analysis of Dogwifhat (WIF) on X, forecasting a massive 2,500% price surge for the memecoin. According to Zeberg’s analysis, WIF is poised for a significant rally, potentially reaching $78, driven by a larger ABC pattern and a series of smaller subwaves. How Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Could Hit $78 Zeberg’s weekly WIF/USDT chart illustrates a large ABC corrective pattern, a fundamental structure in technical analysis that indicates a retracement phase within a broader bullish trend. This ABC pattern, according to Zeberg’s analysis, could eventually culminate at point C around $78. This target is based on the completion of the larger ABC structure, with the price reaching new highs once the correction phase concludes which he describes with the words “economy catches up with bull market.” Within this larger ABC structure, Zeberg also maps out a series of five smaller waves, which are part of the overall upward momentum in the market. These five waves align with the principles of Elliott Wave theory, a method used to predict price movements based on market psychology. In Zeberg’s chart, the five waves (labeled 1 through 5) represent the early stages of the price rally, with the first wave being the initial breakout, and the subsequent waves following through with increasingly higher price points. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Shines With 15% Rally In The Past Week — Is $2.8 The Next Stop? The first wave drove the WIF price to a high of $3.04, followed by a correction in the second wave that brought it down to $2.00. With the correction now complete, Zeberg predicts that WIF could catapult to $6.59. For wave 4, Zeberg anticipates a dip to $4.59 before the memecoin takes off towards $15.24. The chart also highlights important Fibonacci retracement and extension levels, which Zeberg uses to project potential support and resistance zones as WIF progresses. The 2.618 Fibonacci extension level, positioned around $6.59, aligns with Zeberg’s immediate short-term target. Following this, higher extension levels at 3.618 and 4.618 ($11.96 and $21.69, respectively) suggest further upward momentum, which could take the price to the anticipated $78 target if the market continues to follow this trajectory. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Prepares For A Bullish Breakout – Analyst Sets $3 Target Zeberg’s prediction for the near term includes a price movement towards $6.3 by the end of this week, followed by a brief pullback. From there, he expects WIF to climb towards $13-$15 by late November or early December. These intermediate price targets are key milestones in the larger cycle that will eventually lead to the projected price of $78, marked by the completion of the ABC pattern. Zeberg writes via X: “Could we see ~6.3 USD by end of week. Then pullback before move to ~13-15 USD by end of November – early December? If WIF manages these steps – well then ~78 USD is a probable target. I’m extremely BULLISH!!!!” At press time, dogwifhat traded at $3.079.

Notably, Bitcoin has been up by about 20.8% from its November low of $67,690, which has allowed it to break into new all-time highs successively. Interestingly, technical analysis of the Bitcoin price suggests this uptrend isn’t stopping soon, and Bitcoin holders can continue to expect gains as the year draws to a close. According to crypto analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino, CMT, the SuperTrend indicator is now pointing to a bullish continuation for the Bitcoin price. What’s more intriguing is the fact that this marks the first time the indicator is rising after 34 weeks of sideways movement. SuperTrend Indicator Points To Bullish Continuation Crypto analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino has added further weight to this positive outlook surrounding the Bitcoin price. According to his analysis, the recent bullish price action has seen the SuperTrend indicator, an indicator often used to gauge market direction, trending upwards for Bitcoin on the weekly timeframe. Interestingly, technical analysis of the Bitcoin price chart on the weekly candlestick timeframe shows that the SuperTrend indicator had been moving horizontally since March 2024 up until recently. Throughout this period, the indicator held steady despite volatility, even during Bitcoin’s downward spike in August, when Bitcoin dipped to $49,600. Even then, Bitcoin managed to recover, finding support on the weekly SuperTrend line. Next Target For The Bitcoin Price Recent market dynamics have seen the Bitcoin price reeling in bullish sentiment. To put this in context, the Bitcoin price has been trading within a range of $78,649 to $81,800 in the past 24 hours, with a trading volume of $83.7 billion, according to CoinGecko. As such, Bitcoin now has an all-time high of $81,800 at the time of writing, although it has corrected a bit and is currently trading at $80,965. Now, with the SuperTrend indicator turning upward, there is a renewed sense of optimism for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. As noted by Tony Severino in another post on social media platform X, the recent uptrend has seen Bitcoin kicking off a new upside move within an uptrend channel that has been in formation since October 2023. Interestingly, the first guaranteed target in light of this upside move is in the middle of the uptrend channel, which Severino highlighted to be $100,000. With Bitcoin currently trading at around $81,000, this target represents a further increase of about 23.5%. However, if the Bitcoin were to reach the upper trendline of this uptrend channel, it would see it reaching the $170,000 price threshold, which would represent a 110% increase from the current price.

This surge comes in the wake of Donald Trump’s recent victory over Democrat candidate Kamala Harris in the US presidential election, with Bitcoin experiencing a 23% increase over the past week and a 5.5% rise in the last 24 hours. Optimism Grows For $100,000 Bitcoin Bloomberg reports that as Bitcoin hits a new record high, options traders are now targeting the $100,000 mark, speculating that it could be reached before the end of the year. Traders on options exchange Deribit are particularly active, with large bets being placed on Bitcoin reaching this milestone. A notable $100,000 call option set to expire on December 27 has garnered significant attention, with reports indicating that it has already increased in value by 30%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $82,500 As MicroStrategy Makes Major 27,200 BTC Purchase Nick Forster, founder of Derive, a decentralized finance protocol for options trading, commented, “We’re witnessing some significant movements in the wake of the US election.” As of Monday morning in London, there was approximately 9,635 Bitcoin—valued at around $780 million—in open interest tied to bets on Bitcoin hitting $100,000 by the December expiration. According to Bloomberg, this represents the highest amount of capital riding on any single trade for that expiry date, with Deribit estimating an 18.6% probability of this trade paying off. Uptrend Linked To Anticipated Regulatory Changes Under Trump Le Shi, managing director at market-making firm Auros in Hong Kong, noted that the current uptrend in the broader market is due to a number of promises made by Trump during the election campaign. These include making Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset for the US, firing the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on his first day in office and introducing a clearer regulatory framework to support the market’s growth. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Volume Hits $60 Billion As ETH Aims For Yearly Highs Shi believes that the combination of favorable market conditions, growing institutional interest, and a supportive regulatory environment under Trump’s administration could create a conducive backdrop for further price appreciation.

In the past week alone, bitcoin has added almost $20,000 from its Nov. 6 low of $66,700. It was trading recently at $84,255, having climbed as high as $84,989, according to CoinDesk Indices data. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, has climbed 29% since the election.  The interesting part is that the so-called magnificent seven tech stocks are underperforming.

However, this strategy has also had a notable impact on Microstrategy’s stock MSTR, which jumped 11% on Monday as the announcement was made and is currently trading at approximately $299 per share, up from $270 the previous week. Post-Election Bull Run The current uptrend in Bitcoin’s price also coincides with a notable shift in investor sentiment following Donald Trump’s victory in the recent US presidential election against Vice President Kamala Harris. According to CoinShares, digital asset investment products experienced inflows of $1.98 billion following the election, marking the fifth consecutive week of positive inflows and bringing the year-to-date total to a record $31.3 billion. Along with the largest cryptocurrency on the market, the overall global assets under management (AuM) in cryptocurrencies have reached an all-time high of $116 billion. The inflows were predominantly driven by US investors, who contributed $1.95 billion, while European markets also saw smaller inflows, particularly in Switzerland and Germany. Bitcoin alone attracted $1.8 billion of these inflows, reflecting a broader trend that has emerged since the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cut interest rates in September. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Soars 50% In a Flash: Is More Upside Ahead? Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, noted that the bullish momentum in the crypto market is fueled by a sense of “euphoria” following Trump’s election. Streeter commented that his pledge to ‘go all in on crypto’ has sent BTC to “new, heady heights,” and ultimately believes that Trump’s shift towards supporting the cryptocurrency industry has created a more favorable regulatory environment, boosting investor confidence. In further support of this sentiment, Citi strategists highlighted that cryptocurrencies remain one of the few Trump-related trades that have not retraced. They noted that his administration’s expected crypto-friendly policies could lead to greater regulatory clarity in the US, further encouraging investment. Overall, as Bitcoin continues its uptrend, some predict that BTC could reach the $100,000 milestone by the end of the year, driven by a combination of favorable market conditions and growing institutional adoption. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto is trading at $82,479, up 20% in the past week alone.

According to the Stock-to-Flow model, Bitcoin’s position in the red-orange zone after the halving is a historically positive signal. RSI nearing 70 suggests overvaluation, but historically for Bitcoin, it doesn’t signal a downward trend. BTC's overcapitalization and concentrated supply may limit gains, but $100K isn’t as far off as it seems. Here we go again, talking about the father of crypto, during an important phase of its momentum. The recent break of the all-time high (ATH) and surpassing the $80,000 mark could be a good moment to take a deep breath and start thinking deeply about what Bitcoin is aiming to do next. Where is the price of BTC/USD heading? Not really sure. Because despite various apocalyptic or conspiracy theories, is BTC/USD truly on its way to $100,000? Let's look at some statistical and on-chain data to see where we are and where Bitcoin might go next. What is happening in the crypto world? It may seem obvious to say now, but Bitcoin is currently in a bull market . However, what seems clear now was not so evident just two weeks ago, when there was fear in the market (neutral zone of Fear & Greed Index) and a potential distribution phase for BTC/USD. Something like this. BTC/USD (TradingView) Then, Trump’s unexpected win in the election , along with talk of a new wave of deregulation and his surprising alliance with Elon Musk , quickly shifted the mood in the crypto market. Suddenly, what felt like caution and fear turned into excitement. According to the CMC's Fear & Greed Index , we’ve moved into the ""greed"" territory now. And that’s worth discussing. In my view, Bitcoin breaking its recent all-time high, while the market is feeling optimistic, is a strong signal: it shows the breakout was welcomed with open arms and positive energy. CMC Fear & Greed (coinmarketcap) Additionally, there is still no sign of an altseason, because Bitcoin dominance is increasing, while altcoin dominance is decreasing. So, despite BTC/USD surpassing its all-time high (ATH), the market interest in buying Bitcoin has not faded. Bitcoin Dominance (coinmarketcap) This is also evident when analyzing Bitcoin's ""Long Term Holder Supply,"" which is decreasing, even though there hasn’t been a significant sell-off that would indicate whales are taking profits. Long Term Holder Supply (bitbo) This trend also seems to be confirmed by the derivatives market , with a strong growth in open interest among the largest crypto firms. BTC Open Interest Statistics (coinalyze) A significant short liquidation occurred just before BTC/USD touched the $80,000 mark, in the $79,000 zone, totaling around $300 million. Aggregated Liquidation (coinalyze) A Deep Dive into the Stock-to-Flow Model So, where is BTC/USD heading now? To answer this, I’d like to introduce the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) chart , which, in my opinion, is one of the best tools for navigating the complex world of Bitcoin. We are currently at a very interesting point because the halving has already taken place , and the chart's color has shifted into the red zone, moving towards the orange area. From a statistical perspective, this zone is worth paying close attention to. In previous bull runs, the breakout of the previous all-time high (ATH) always occurred within the red-orange zone after a halving. I’ve been in the crypto market since 2015, and every time we’ve reached this area, it seemed almost impossible for Bitcoin to find the momentum to push higher. Yet, each time, a strong catalyst emerged. But, returning to the thread, according to the Stock-to-Flow model, and backed by statistical evidence, the breakout of the previous ATH in the red-orange zone of the Bitcoin halving cycle is typically a good signal for Bitcoin. Stock to Flow (Bitbo) Technical Perspective What’s the target price for BTC/USD? That’s a great and intriguing question. If you have a definite answer, please let me know … But we can make some educated guesses. We are already said that, previous bull market was difficult to predict because it happened after BTC/USD had already risen significantly. This is evident when looking at a classic 14-period RSI on the 1-week timeframe. Each time the RSI entered the overbought zone and people started to believe that BTC/USD was overvalued, Bitcoin would counterattack and push higher. Ok … first thing to note: Currently, BTC is approaching the 70-point level on the RSI, which I find to be an intriguing signal. BTC/USD, 1W (TradingView) But if a new bull run is coming, where could it be headed? During the 2017 bull run, Bitcoin pumped over 8x, and in the 2020 bull run, it pumped 4x. Following this pattern, we might expect a smaller multiplier this time, indicating a potential contraction in the extent of the bull market. This trend can be explained by the increase in market cap and the growing supply of BTC, which have led to a decrease in Bitcoin's annualized volatility. Bitcoin Annualized Volatility (Dune (@21co)) In my opinion, we shouldn’t expect a bull run similar to those we’ve seen in previous cycles. The target set by the Stock-to-Flow model, which suggests a BTC/USD price of around $300,000, seems unrealistic at this point. However, I do believe that the widely anticipated target of $100,000, mentioned by many in the crypto community, is becoming far more achievable. RISK The risk remains the same as always, aside from potential issues like a U.S. political crisis or an economic recession : the extreme concentration of BTC supply in a few addresses. The table below illustrates this situation perfectly. It’s not just our capital at risk but also the decentralized nature of Bitcoin itself. For instance, if centralized exchanges (CEX) like Binance, with a CEO like CZ,well known for his ""playful"" control, hold more than 2% of the Bitcoin supply (based only on publicly declared addresses), a new risk emerges: a ""Binance risk,"" not just a risk to the Bitcoin network. Top 100 Bitcoin Holders (Dune (@21co)) The issue becomes even more pronounced when we consider another fact: over 82% of the BTC supply is held in fewer than 200,000 addresses. This could be alarming, as it’s often unclear who these holders are and what their intentions might be with their assets. It’s definitely something worth thinking about. Bitcoin distribution (bitinfocharts) Conclusion In conclusion, BTC/USD appears to be well-positioned at the moment. With a combination of strong technical momentum, bullish sentiment analysis, and a favorable statistical outlook, I believe a ""BUY"" rating for this crypto pair is well justified.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4736016-bitcoin-could-be-ready-for-the-next-step-100k?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36119283.jpeg

36121873,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101148,1731338810,"Seasoned Analyst Says Dogecoin to Surge 7,961% to $23.25","Dogecoin could surge 1,270% to $3.95 or skyrocket 7,961% to $23.35, according to analyst Ali Martinez's Fibonacci-based prediction. Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently been one of the hottest meme coins, driven by explosive price movements. Yesterday, Dogecoin nearly hit the $0.30 mark after surging 37% on Sunday from $0.2173 to $0.2966.Remarkably, considering that Dogecoin traded at just $0.1486 a week ago, the token has skyrocketed 99.6% in under seven days. During this time, Dogecoin has also improved its market ranking, now standing as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, surpassing XRP and the USDC stablecoin. Despite the recent gains, analysts like Ali Martinez believe that Dogecoin has not yet reached its full potential. In an analysis shared over the weekend, Martinez suggested that DOGE is on the verge of a parabolic run that could clear unprecedented price levels.Martinez’s optimism is grounded in historical patterns, citing past price movements and Fibonacci retracement levels. According to Martinez, Dogecoin’s potential peak could fall within the 1.618 to 2.272 Fibonacci levels, suggesting a price range between $3.95 and $23.25.Dogecoin’s Historical Pattern AnalysisThe accompanying chart shows that Dogecoin recently broke out from a long-standing resistance trendline, a pattern that has occurred during previous bullish cycles. In fact, a similar breakout in Dogecoin’s history saw the price explode by 16,000%.In the 2017–2018 cycle, Dogecoin broke its downtrend after 1,155 days of bearish performance. This breakout occurred when the price surpassed $0.0002, leading to a massive 8,933% surge by the end of the cycle in 2018, adding $0.01857 to the price, which was near the 1.618 Fibonacci level.Similarly, during the 2020–2021 cycle, Dogecoin saw an even more dramatic price surge, boosted by Elon Musk’s endorsements. Dogecoin had entered another 1,096 days of bearish performance before breaking out at around $0.003. Thanks to Musk's influence, Dogecoin experienced an astonishing 15,534% rally, bringing its price close to the 2.272 Fibonacci level at $0.734.Given that the 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci levels have coincided with Dogecoin’s peak prices in the past two cycles, Martinez suggests that the meme coin could either surge to $3.95 (at the 1.618 level) or $23.25 (at the 2.272 level). Price Target AnalysisCurrently, with DOGE trading at $0.2884, reaching the lower target of $3.95 would represent a massive 1,269% increase from current levels. On the other hand, the upper target of $23.35 would require an even more substantial rally, representing a 7,961% gain.",POSITIVE,DOGE | XRP | USDC,DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | USDC,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/11/seasoned-analyst-says-dogecoin-to-surge-7961-to-23-25/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=seasoned-analyst-says-dogecoin-to-surge-7961-to-23-25,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The market’s positive response to his election victory has fuelled an impressive 23 percent surge in the BTC price from the pre-election dip. Record-breaking ETF inflows, totalling $2.28 billion over three days, signal renewed institutional demand for Bitcoin. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF alone drew $1.1 billion in net inflows, reversing prior outflows seen during pre-election de-risking. This surge in demand marks a notable shift, with buying interest absorbing selling pressure at all-time highs and stabilising market dynamics. A marked increase in the Aggregated Spot Cumulative Volume Delta shows that there has been strong buying across major exchanges post-election. With open interest (OI) in Bitcoin futures and perpetual contracts also reaching an all-time high of $45.43 billion, the market signals heightened speculative activity, yet remains relatively stable as OI and price are in equilibrium at elevated levels. In addition, the current wave of profit-taking is comparatively modest , compared to the March all-time high, when realised profits peaked at $3.1 billion. We believe this reflects a maturing market that has recalibrated its fair value expectations. While the momentum is promising, the $82,000-85,000 zone could act as a psychological resistance point. We anticipate some consolidation or a potential pullback to $77,000 to close the CME gap before Bitcoin continues its climb on higher time frames. The market’s resilience, bolstered by institutional participation and newfound demand, sets a robust foundation for Bitcoin’s price discovery in uncharted territory. The US economy currently shows signs of strength, driven by strong consumer confidence, steady growth, and easing inflation pressures. Following Donald Trump’s election, markets are reacting positively , with optimism around his pro-growth policies, including tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. However, these policies bring inflation risks, especially if tariffs and stricter immigration rules are enacted, potentially increasing prices and wage costs. The Federal Reserve’s recent 0.25 percent rate cut, coupled with strong productivity and a stable labour market, reflects confidence in sustained growth. However the Fed has signalled caution about further cuts, and has indicated that it will remain flexible as it waits for clearer fiscal signals before making further adjustments. Consumer sentiment has also been at its highest since April, fueled by falling gas prices and diminishing short-term inflation concerns. This optimism supports consumer spending, suggesting robust economic performance in the coming months. However, inflation risks and policy uncertainties present potential challenges, making this an economically optimistic yet cautious period. For crypto, the Trump election victory has been perceived as very positive , sparking a surge in Bitcoin’s price and lifting crypto-centric stocks amid hopes of reduced regulations and the potential for a national Bitcoin reserve. This week, we also saw Tether expanding its use case through the successful financing of a $45 million crude oil transaction in the Middle East, marking its entry into the commodities market. Through its new Trade Finance division, Tether is positioning USDt as a transformative tool for faster, cost-effective global trade, with ambitions to extend into diverse sectors beyond energy. On the regulatory front, the SEC has again delayed its decision on options for spot Ethereum ETFs, citing concerns over investor protection and market stability. This cautious approach reflects ongoing scrutiny of crypto markets, even as Ethereum ETFs have gained traction since July. Have a great trading week!

After a strong upward push, the token has encountered significant selling pressure, raising concerns about the sustainability of its bullish strength. Now, all eyes are on the $0.00001152 mark to determine if it can support a rebound or if this is the beginning of a deeper pullback. This article aims to navigate PEPE‘s recent price action as it encounters resistance, causing the rally to stall and the price to fall toward the crucial support level of $0.00001152. Through technical analysis, this piece assesses whether $0.00001152 will serve as a reliable support zone for a potential recovery or if the bearish pressure will push PEPE further downward. Resistance Strikes: What Halted Momentum Of PEPE? Recently, PEPE’s price has turned bearish on the 4-hour chart, pulling back towards the $0.00001152 mark and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) after facing significant resistance at $0.00001313. This retracement signals growing bearish pressure, which could trigger a deeper correction for the cryptocurrency. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a decline from 77% to 60%, indicating a weakening of upbeat momentum. As the RSI moves closer to neutral, buying pressure has subsided, and the market’s confidence in the uptrend is fading. Specifically, this shift suggests that PEPE may be entering a correction phase, with the potential for further downward movement if the trend continues. Related Reading: PEPE Midterm Price Prediction: Is A 326% Rally To $0.00003474 Possible From Here? Although PEPE is trading above the 100-day SMA, the daily chart shows increasing negative sentiment with bearish candlesticks and a decline toward $0.00001152, reflecting rising selling pressure as the meme coin struggles to hold higher levels. If bulls don’t defend the current support, additional declines are possible, making the 100-day SMA critical to watch for a reversal or continued correctional movement. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI is declining from its peak of 69%, indicating a potential shift in momentum. As the RSI nears the overbought threshold of 70%, this shows that buying pressure is easing, and the recent uptrend may be losing strength. The drop could signal a pullback or consolidation, with PEPE possibly entering a correction phase before attempting to regain upside pressure. Can The $0.00001152 Level Hold As Support? The market is testing its strength as PEPE’s price approaches the key support level of $0.00001152. This level has become crucial in determining whether the current bearish momentum will continue or if the price can stabilize. Should $0.00001152 hold, it may provide a foundation for a possible rebound, allowing bulls to regain control and resume the upside trend.

36117811,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101142,1731336968,Legendary Analyst Brandt Confirms $240K Bitcoin Target with Rare Technical Indicator,"As Bitcoin has surged past $82K today, seasoned analyst Peter Brandt identified a bullish pattern that could drive Bitcoin beyond $240K. Bitcoin reached a historic milestone early Monday , trading above $82,000 for the first time. This surge follows a post-election rally driven by market optimism surrounding President-elect Donald Trump's commitment to supporting the cryptocurrency sector.Amid this surge, legendary trader Peter Brandt pointed to a rare pattern that could signal even higher Bitcoin prices. His analysis highlights a bullish ""Inverse Head and Shoulders"" (H&S) pattern, which typically indicates a reversal in price trends.https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1855959617051689293Bitcoin Inverse Head and Shoulders AnalysisBrandt’s chart analysis reveals the left shoulder forming in mid-2021, followed by the head in early 2022 when Bitcoin's price dipped to approximately $15,000. The right shoulder formed in 2024, completing this rare pattern. Historically, this setup suggests significant upward momentum, with Brandt projecting Bitcoin could surpass $240,000 if the pattern holds true.In a separate analysis, Brandt compared Bitcoin’s current trajectory to Gold’s rally in 2010. Gold's price surged past the $1,000 mark and eventually doubled, reaching over $2,672 after the inverse head and shoulders pattern formed. Brandt’s comparison suggests Bitcoin could follow a similar path, with the $200,000 target aligning with other bullish market forecasts.Analyst Warns of Short-Term 25% CorrectionsDespite the optimism, investor Alistair Milne anticipates a potential correction before Bitcoin reaches $100,000. He foresees a 20-25% dip, which could bring Bitcoin’s value back to the $60,000 range. Milne warns that sellers may capitalize on gains at levels above $95,000, temporarily slowing the rally.However, analysts point to sustained interest from institutional and retail investors as a crucial factor in driving long-term growth. This persistent demand could offset short-term corrections and ultimately propel Bitcoin’s price well beyond $100,000.On the other hand, crypto analyst Tuur Demeester has observed a notable shift in Bitcoin's relationship with the stock market, suggesting a potential decoupling. His analysis highlights Bitcoin's performance against the Dow Jones Global Index (DJW) from 2020 to November 2024. This move could signal its growing independence from broader financial markets and lead to further gains.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/11/legendary-analyst-brandt-confirms-240k-bitcoin-target-with-rare-technical-indicator/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=legendary-analyst-brandt-confirms-240k-bitcoin-target-with-rare-technical-indicator,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

EGRAG’s XRP/BTC Analysis The widely followed analyst recently took X to analyze XRP’s price action against Bitcoin, XRP/BTC. According to EGRAG, the XRP/BTC tested a crucial support zone labeled “YOLO” (You Only Live Once). In the October 21 tweet , EGRAG emphasized that the XRP/BTC pair attempted to close above the 0.000010 level but failed due to heavy sell pressure. This brought the pair to the ‘YOLO’ support level, highlighted in yellow in the chart. Citing historical trends, EGRAG suggested that the XRP/BTC pair requires an impulsive ‘megathrust surge’ to break above the 0.00001 territory. XRPBTC Pair Chart At press time, the XRP/BTC pair sits at 0.000007360, reflecting a decline of 0.4% in the past 24 hours. This indicates that the pair must surge by 35.86% to hit the 0.00001 range. XRP/BTC Historical Trends To forecast XRP/BTC's future movement, EGRAG first highlighted three previous cycles, which introduced massive spikes. The cycles and their years of occurrence include Cycle A (2014), Cycle B (2017), and Cycle C (2021). In these cycles, the XRP/BTC pair surged to 0.00007, 0.000245, and 0.00003909, respectively. Interestingly, EGRAG suggested that the current XRP/BTC pair is gearing up for a similar surge that could potentially take it to 0.0000221. Here’s XRP Price if BTC Surges to $70K, $100K, $130K, $160K, and $200K In the meantime, the expert highlighted 0.00017 as a crucial level in the XRP/BTC pair that could introduce a massive surge for XRP. At this level, EGRAG suggested that Bitcoin’s future price movements will determine XRP’s value against the USD. Per EGRAG, if the XRP/BTC pair surges to 0.00017 and Bitcoin trades at $70,000, XRP’s price would spike to $12. This represents an increase of 2,243% from the current price of $0.5120. In addition, EGRAG forecasted that Bitcoin’s climb to $100,000 would potentially take XRP to $17 so long as the XRP/BTC pair remains at 0.00017. XRP’s potential surge to $17 marks an increase of 3,220% from the current price. Furthermore, the expert projected that if XRP/BTC holds at 0.00017 and Bitcoin hits the $130,000 target, as predicted by leading asset manager VanEck, XRP would be priced at $22, reflecting an increase of 4,196%. Also, Bitcoin's surge to $160,000 would propel XRP's price to $27, representing a 5,173% surge. Lastly, EGRAG set a target of $34 for XRP should Bitcoin surge to $200,000 when the XRP/BTC pair is at 0.00017. While this prediction looks enticing, caution is advised. Notably, EGRAG warned that XRP could plunge into bearish territory if its BTC pair falls to 0.00000667.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/11/analyst-predicts-3-xrp-price-targets-if-bitcoin-hits-100k-130k-and-160k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-predicts-3-xrp-price-targets-if-bitcoin-hits-100k-130k-and-160k,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

42415543,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJuoo,1731333600,"Espresso, Project for Composability Between Blockchains, Pushes Main Product Live","Espresso, a closely watched blockchain project to coordinate cross-chain transactions and interactions, shared Monday that its main product, known as the confirmation layer, has gone live.  According to the team, the confirmation layer will be a critical piece of infrastructure for composability among rollups, allowing for two networks to read and trust each other's blocks of transaction data. A rollup is a type of auxiliary, or ""layer-2,"" network atop a main blockchain, providing a venue for cheaper and faster transactions.  Specific benefits of Espresso's new confirmation layer could include faster bridging of assets between networks, decentralizing a key component of layer-2 blockchains known as the ""sequencer,"" and providing a way for networks to stash reams of transactional data at a low cost, according to the project documentation.  “It's literally a protocol that a rollup sequencer publishes its blocks to, and once published on the confirmation layer, they can't be changed, even when that chain later settles to Ethereum,” Ben Fisch, CEO of Espresso Systems, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Essentially, this takes on the role of a sequencer today, and adds some security to it. Sequencers are a crucial piece of infrastructure in rollups, bundling up transactions from users of the layer 2 so they can be recorded on the layer 1, in this case Ethereum.  “Optimism, for example, takes seven days to settle on Ethereum,"" Fisch said. ""The confirmation layer enforces that whatever was published to the confirmation layer has to be what is eventually published and settled on the L1. And that means that any node that's reading from the confirmation layer’s published blocks, can just execute them and know exactly what the state of the rollup is.”  Centralized sequencers  The issue with sequencers is that they are typically run by centralized entities, and pose as a single point of failure.  ""As long as that sequencer is honest and doesn't get hacked or compromised, you can just confirm your transactions. That's actually how people use it primarily today – it just creates a massive security risk.” Fisch said. “So while users of the chain rely on it, bridge protocols and applications on other chains can’t. The more you create cross-chain dependencies on what a sequencer says, the more money a hacker can compromise.”  Not only does the confirmation layer add an extra level of security, but it also enables faster and cheaper bridging, according to the Espresso team. The composability of the confirmation layer creates interdependencies between rollups, allowing nodes to read the data and state of other rollups quickly, a press release stated.  Over time, the confirmation layer will begin to integrate with some of the major rollups in the layer-2 space, like Arbitrum’s nitro stack, Optimism’s OP stack and Polygon’s chain development kit.  In March, Espresso raised $28 million in funds to contribute to its products and help with research. The series B round was led by venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz's a16z Crypto and saw participation from many of the developer firms behind the leading layer-2 rollups like Arbitrum, Starknet and Polygon.  In addition to the confirmation layer, Espresso moving forward will focus its research and development in the field of composability and sequencing.

The rally may lose steam if prices reach those levels.  As bitcoin's {{BTC}} ongoing price surge gives off an aura of invincibility, one force threatens to slow the ascent above $90,000, potentially keeping the cryptocurrency rangebound above the said price level.  The force is of market makers or dealers – entities responsible for providing liquidity to the order book, profiting from the bid-ask spread while constantly striving to maintain a market-neutral exposure.  Those making the bitcoin options market on crypto exchange Deribit currently appear to have a significant positive ""gamma"" exposure at the $90,000 and $100,000 strike options. In simple terms, it means traders/investors have sold options at these levels, leaving market makers, who are always on the opposite side, with a large chunk of long positions.  When market makers have long or positive gamma exposures, they tend to buy the underlying asset when its price is falling and sell on the rise to keep their net exposure direction neutral. This hedging acts as a volatility dampener, restricting price swings.  In bitcoin's case, it means market makers will likely trade against the market direction between $90,000 and $100,000, thereby keeping prices rangebound, assuming other things being equal.  ""We see a lot of traders owning [buying] optionality up to the $90K handle for Nov 29th and Dec 27th. But the $90k-$100k+ range has been sold to dealers,"" Amberdata's Director of Derivatives, Greg Magadini, said.  ""Should the market get there, we might see prices struggle, unless sentiment shifts further bullish,"" Magadini added.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call gives the right to buy and the put option confers the right to sell.  Gamma is one of the critical options ""Greeks,"" measuring how much the price of an option accelerates when the underlying asset's price moves. The net gamma exposure determines how aggressively an options market maker needs to buy or sell the underlying asset to keep overall exposure neutral.

Investor sentiment is increasingly optimistic, driven by a surge in Ethereum’s on-chain activity. Key data from IntoTheBlock reveals that transaction volume on Ethereum’s mainnet has reached its highest levels since July, a bullish signal highlighting renewed interest and activity in the network. This surge in volume is often seen as confirmation of a breakout, aligning with expectations from investors who have anticipated a strong rally toward Ethereum’s yearly highs. Related Reading: Avalanche Nears Breakout – Top Analyst Sets $420 Target For AVAX This Cycle With momentum building, ETH now stands at a pivotal point: if it can maintain strength above these new levels, the stage may be set for further upside as the broader crypto market rallies alongside Bitcoin. The next few days will be crucial for Ethereum as traders watch to see if the bullish sentiment can sustain and propel ETH higher into new price territory. Ethereum Bullish Trend Begins Ethereum has entered a new bullish phase after eight months of consistent selling pressure and significant accumulation by smart money. Following a long period of subdued price action, ETH is finally rising, signaling a trend reversal many analysts and investors eagerly awaited. Data shared by IntoTheBlock on X shows that Ethereum’s mainnet transaction volume has surged significantly, with nearly $60 billion settled over the past week—the highest level since July. This spike in volume is a clear indicator of renewed market interest, and it suggests that more investors are actively trading and accumulating ETH. When transaction volumes rise alongside price increases, it often signals healthy demand and strong market confidence, supporting the likelihood of a sustained bullish trend. Related Reading: Cardano Skyrockets Over 40% – Funding Rate Suggests Further Upside The next few months are expected to be volatile as speculative interest and trading activity heat up, with many traders positioning for substantial gains. Despite the anticipated price swings, analysts agree that Ethereum’s next major target is its yearly high of $4,000. Breaking this level would confirm Ethereum’s bullish momentum and set the stage for potential new all-time highs, aligning with the broader market’s optimism. ETH Consolidates Above $3,000 Ethereum is trading at $3,180, following a recent push to a local high of $3,250. After a strong weekend rally, the price paused, hinting at the need for consolidation before another potential breakout. This period of sideways movement could be essential for ETH to establish support and prepare for further upside, as it allows buyers to gather momentum while absorbing any short-term selling pressure. Key technical levels show that bullish sentiment is likely to strengthen if ETH maintains its position above $2,950, aligned with the 200-day moving average (MA). Holding this critical support level would signal buyers remain in control, setting up ETH for a potential rally toward $3,500 soon. However, it’s also possible that ETH could take a few days to build up the momentum needed for its next substantial move as investors assess the recent rally and consider upcoming catalysts.

Positive changes are expected for crypto markets early in the new administration, the report said  Standard Chartered said we have now entered a crypto summer.  A Republican sweep would allow the new government to push through positive policies for the digital assets sector, which could lead to total crypto market cap swelling to $10 trillion by the end of 2026, investment bank Standard Chartered (STAN) said in a research report on Friday.  Standard Chartered said it sees a number of tailwinds for crypto markets early in the new administration including regulatory changes and a shuffle of positions at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that could lead to a more benign stance on digital assets.  The bank said these positive developments could see total crypto market cap grow fourfold from $2.5 trillion currently to $10 trillion by the end of 2026.  ""The rising tide should lift all digital assets; those most exposed to end-use cases are set to benefit most,"" wrote Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.  The new administration may also consider the formation of a bitcoin reserve, but this is viewed as a ""low-probability but high-impact event,"" the report said.  The bank reiterated its 2025 year-end target of around $200,000 for bitcoin {{BTC}} and $10,000 for ether {{ETH}}, and said it expected solana {{SOL}} to outperform the largest two cryptocurrencies.

Specifically, in the heat of the bull momentum, XRP broke to a six-week high above $0.616, staging an 11% rally from its low of $0.5562.However, XRP has struggled to maintain these gains, as it has not only lost the $0.60 level but also dropped back to near $0.56, settling at $0.5730. Nonetheless, the weekend price action triggered excitement in the XRP community. Meanwhile, analysts have stated that the real action for XRP has yet to begin, forecasting even more dramatic price moves.

In a follow-up post , 360Trader drew a connection between XRP and Cardano (ADA), noting that ADA’s recent momentum is prompting XRP to begin its own bull run. Over the weekend, Cardano surprised the market by breaking a seven-month high, trading above $0.65 for the first time since April.ADA Waking Up XRPADA surged by 33.14%, rising from $0.4899 to $0.6523 on Sunday, while XRP’s rally was more modest at 11%, though it was enough to push the price back into the $0.60 range. Notably, Cardano’s Sunday surge built on momentum that started on Wednesday when ADA was trading much lower at $0.326. Since then, Cardano has doubled in price, with cumulative gains of 101%.While XRP's momentum lagged behind Cardano’s over the weekend, analysts believe XRP’s turn is just around the corner.What an XRP Price Explosion Would Look LikeWhen asked what an XRP price explosion might look like, 360Trader explained that it would involve XRP rallying to $4 and then sustaining that momentum before doubling to $8. However, he noted that this would not happen in a single move. This would represent a massive 1,303% gain from XRP’s current price.https://twitter.com/360_trader/status/1855378859895693808Meanwhile, other analysts, like Egrag, have pointed out that if XRP successfully breaks above the psychological $1.10 threshold, it could set the stage for an even more explosive run, potentially reaching as high as $13. This would represent a colossal 2,180% gain from XRP’s current price of $0.57.",POSITIVE,ADA | XRP,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/11/top-analyst-tired-of-the-xrp-hype-but-the-current-xrp-price-squeeze-is-hard-to-ignore/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-analyst-tired-of-the-xrp-hype-but-the-current-xrp-price-squeeze-is-hard-to-ignore,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Farina made the assertion in response to questions from his X followers about whether it is appropriate to purchase XRP now or wait for a price retracement. Notably, he does not recommend waiting, as he thinks XRP might not see any major dip. The analyst claimed he had successfully predicted XRP’s downturn in the past, especially when the asset plunged to $0.20 after the SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple in 2020. https://twitter.com/edward_farina/status/1855788250322886800XRP Prowess for Strong Growth At the time of the analysis, XRP was priced at $0.60, which, in Farina’s view, is highly undervalued. He shared a similar sentiment for Stellar (XLM), which was trading at $0.11 at the time of the post. According to Farina, both XRP and XLM have strong growth potential, citing their relevance in the financial sector. The expert also provided insights into the historical performances of both cryptocurrencies during a bull run. He suggested that both cryptocurrencies are usually the last to surge in a bull run. Nonetheless, he said both assets end up with the biggest gains, as seen in 2018 when XRP’s price soared 36,000% to an ATH of $3.84. XRP Set for Major Rally The expert forecasted an imminent price surge for XRP, advising investors to acquire XRP immediately rather than wait for a retracement. He indicated that people could miss out on a potential rally if they choose to wait. According to Farina, people should acquire at least 10,000 XRP, which costs about $5,820. Afterward, he urged them to diversify their investments into other promising assets like XLM. No Regrets Furthermore, he suggested a long-term approach for XRP and other assets, which could help investors “beat the institutions.” He indicated that investors will have no regrets over the next five years when reflecting on their initial XRP investment. “It doesn’t matter, guys; I promise you will look back five years from now, and it will not matter at all if you bought XRP at $0.55, $0.60, $0.65, or even $1,” Farina remarked. XRP has witnessed slight gains amid the broader crypto rally driven by Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential election. The price of XRP surged above the $0.60 mark, hitting an intraday high of $0.6160. At press time, XRP is trading at $0.5820, reflecting a daily decline of 0.33%.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | ZRX,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/11/analyst-says-dont-wait-to-buy-xrp-instead-buy-xrp-and-wait/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-dont-wait-to-buy-xrp-instead-buy-xrp-and-wait,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

42435165,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLIWH,1731330368,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Hits $82K as Weekend Rally Extends,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,561.84 +2.14%  Bitcoin (BTC): $82,358.65 +3.65%  Ether (ETH): $3,201.51 +0.19%  S&P 500: 5,995.54 +0.38%  Gold: $2,659.68 -0.94%  Nikkei 225: 39,533.32 +0.08%  Top Stories  Bitcoin passed $80,000 for the first time on Sunday and topped $82,000 on Monday. BTC enjoyed an unusually busy weekend, rising over 4% amid trading volumes of almost $100 billion. Weekend pumps in the crypto market are seen as bullish indicators, given that professional traders and institutional investors are much less active. The positive sentiment extended into the new week, with BTC climbing as high as $82,394. Futures premiums on BTC-tracked products are soaring, indicating a bias for bullish bets. The popularity of the $80,000 call on Deribit points to potential dealer hedging around the key level.  Dogecoin and shiba inu led gains among major cryptocurrencies with price jumps of 22% and 12%, respectively, at the time of writing. DOGE flipped XRP and USDC to become the sixth-largest token by market cap. DOGE has jumped on renewed endorsements by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, pushing it 88% in the past 30 days. Over the weekend, ether climbed above $3,000 for the first time since early August in a sign it's set to break out of its range-bound price action. SOL has also registered healthy gains, climbing over 4.5% in the last 24 hours on the back of some ebullient memecoin activity in its ecosystem.  U.S.-listed crypto equities saw significant gains in pre-market trading following BTC's rally. MicroStrategy, which owns over 250,000 bitcoin, gained more than 11% to just above $300 per share. Copycat Semler Scientific surged 25% and is approaching a high for the year, while Coinbase added almost 17%. Marathon Holdings is leading advances among miners, rising almost 20%. The positive price action is helped by the 26,842 bitcoin held on its balance sheet, a level surpassed only by MicroStrategy. Other notable miner performances include Riot Platforms, Iris Energy and HIVE Digital Technologies, which are all up double digits.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the monthly stablecoin transfer volume on the Celo blockchain, which is designed to facilitate mobile-first financial services, allowing users to move cryptocurrencies using phone numbers.  The volume more than doubled to nearly $4 billion in October amid allegations of wash trading.

The repurchase was funded by Bankman-Fried's trading firm Alameda Research, but his second-in-command Caroline Ellison warned that “we don’t really have the money for this,"" according to a court filing.  Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has taken legal action against rival Binance and former Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao over an alleged fraudulent repurchase of shares by FTX's former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried.  Bankman-Fried negotiated to buy Binance and Zhao's stake in FTX in July 2021 using FTX's native token, FTT, and Binance-issued coins BNB and BUSD, which were then worth around $1.76 billion.  The purchase was funded by Bankman-Fried's trading firm, Alameda Research. Alameda, however, was insolvent at the time, and second-in-command Caroline Ellison warned that “we don’t really have the money for this, we’ll have to borrow from FTX to do it,” according to a Sunday filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.  The document alleges that FTX was already insolvent and the FTT tokens worthless at the time of the transaction, and therefore the transfer should be classed as fraudulent.  FTX entered bankruptcy in November 2022 following revelations unearthed by CoinDesk about balance sheet irregularities between the exchange and Alameda. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison earlier this year on numerous counts of fraud.  The exchange's dramatic collapse was in some ways hastened by Binance and Zhao selling their large holdings of FTT, which helped crash its value and worsen FTX's position.  FTX alleges that Zhao sought to harm his competitor by sending out a series of tweets about the company that were ""false, misleading and fraudulent,"" and destroyed value that would have otherwise been recoverable by FTX’s stakeholders, according to the filing.  In response to FTX's action, a Binance spokesperson said “The claims are meritless, and we will vigorously defend ourselves,"" in an emailed statement shared with CoinDesk.

According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, the trader raked in $3 million in an hour by monitoring Binance's new listings. This emerged as the ongoing bull run gained momentum, sparking several big-money gains in the market and attracting the attention of retail investors.Notably, listings on centralized exchanges are highly sought after by crypto traders, who aim to secure favorable entry positions. During a bull market, the prices of newly listed tokens often see rapid gains due to heightened market participation and the frenzy surrounding community interest. Binance, the largest exchange by volume globally, and Coinbase, the leading exchange in the U.S., have their listings closed and monitored.A Transaction That Shocked The Ecosystem The trader made swift moves when the ACT token was listed on Binance, with several users praising the speed of the trade. Upon the listing of ACT, the trader spent 1,558 SOL, worth approximately $318,000, to acquire the tokens.Remarkably, the 10.9 million ACT tokens purchased soon appreciated in value, growing to a worth of $3.4 million—a transaction that has been widely celebrated. This success adds another crypto millionaire to the list of those benefiting from the market's positive momentum.Inside Trading?After Lookonchain shared details about the trader's $3 million windfall, BWE News confirmed that the trader in question was part of their team. However, the firm clarified that the trade was executed 2.4 seconds after the listing went live, adding that they are not Binance insiders and dismissing any speculation about insider trading.https://twitter.com/bwenews/status/1855870606690172953In a related development on October 25, another trader made $140,000 in less than 20 minutes. Following Binance’s announcement of the MOODENG perpetual contract, this trader bought 2.7 million tokens with 1,300 SOL, netting a huge profit in just minutes.Bullish Outlook for Crypto MarketMany crypto traders believe the market rally will continue, especially with expectations of positive crypto regulation in the U.S. Additionally, rate cuts in various jurisdictions have driven capital toward riskier assets, benefiting meme coins and newly launched tokens rather than a scenario where funds flow out of the market.As of the last 24 hours, the crypto market has reached a $2.7 trillion market cap, with Bitcoin trading above $82,000.",POSITIVE,SOL,EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/11/one-smart-trader-nets-3m-in-one-hour-from-binance-new-listing-heres-how/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=one-smart-trader-nets-3m-in-one-hour-from-binance-new-listing-heres-how,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36110151,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652500,1731326428,"Bitcoin Price Blasts Through $82,000: These Are The Key Reasons","Bitcoin surged past the $82,000 mark on Binance, marking a substantial 17% increase since the public announcement of Donald Trump’s victory in the recent US presidential election on Wednesday, November 6. Over the past weekend, the BTC price staged a rare “weekend pump”, rallying by more than 6%. While there are several reasons for this move, one clear main reason stands out: The victory of Donald Trump. #1 The Bitcoin “Trump Pump” Donald Trump’s victory has significantly bolstered Bitcoin’s market sentiment, primarily due to his campaign promises and supportive legislative initiatives. During his election campaign, Trump pledged to establish a national Bitcoin reserve by retaining ownership of the 208,000 Bitcoins confiscated through various law enforcement actions over the years. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming often dubbed the “Bitcoin Senator” for her staunch advocacy, introduced the Bitcoin Act. This legislation aims to acquire 1 million BTC within a five-year timeframe. As Bitcoinist reported, the Bitcoin reserve could become a reality quite fast. BTC Inc. David Bailey, who is a key Bitcoin advisor to Trump, said recently that it could be done within the “first 100 days” of Trump’s term. In light of this, crypto research firm Matrixport writes in their latest investor note: “With expectations that Trump will transform US regulatory policies into a more pro-crypto environment, the bullish momentum appears difficult to halt. With his inauguration set for January 20, 2025, the market has several weeks to sustain this rally. Related Reading: How High Can Bitcoin Go In 2025? Legendary Trader Reveals Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, echoed this optimism on X: “Some of y’all don’t believe Trump is about to trash the $ and print money. BTC disagrees. Here is Bitcoin leading vs. my new money supply indicator US Bank Credit. The market is speaking, listen up.” Renowned crypto analyst MacroScope (@MacroScope17) further elaborated on the implications for institutional investors: “Very important for BTC traders to understand how the game has changed since the election. In the institutional world, investments are built around having a thesis It’s hard to overstate how much the thesis has now changed for BTC in terms of the policy/political element.” #2 Rumors About Bitcoin Nation-State Adoption The strategic plans to establish a national Bitcoin reserve under Trump carry substantial geopolitical weight, potentially igniting a global race to amass Bitcoin reserves. David Bailey remarked, “The Bitcoin Space Race has begun,” noting that “the game theory is playing out faster than anyone could have expected.” Mike Alfred, founder and Managing Partner of Alpine Fox LP, shared his excitement on X: “I just got a call out of the blue. It was someone important and they said someone huge is buying Bitcoin in size tonight. I almost couldn’t believe it when they said the name. Wild. We are going so much higher.” Related Reading: Economist Predicts ‘Blow-Off Top’ For Bitcoin At $123,000 Post-Trump Win Bailey commented on November 10, “There is at least one nation state that has been actively acquiring Bitcoin and is now a top 5 holder. Hopefully, we hear from them soon.” His assertion, accompanied by a meme suggesting certainty over speculation. He added on the size: “Top 5 holder of bitcoin across all users.” There is at least one nation state that has been actively acquiring Bitcoin and is now a top 5 holder. Hopefully we hear from them soon. — David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) November 9, 2024 #3 Short Squeeze A significant short squeeze has also contributed to Bitcoin’s price surge. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, commented on X: “Circa $1B of shorts squeezed! From the weekend move from $76 to $81K. Open interest at the same level as when BTC traded at $62K. Provided funding continues to settle down, a very healthy up move.” Data from Coinglass corroborates this, revealing that on Sunday, $133.15 million in BTC shorts were liquidated, with additional $33 million on Saturday. This substantial liquidation of short positions has reduced selling pressure, thereby fueling further upward momentum in Bitcoin’s price. #4 Retail Is Back The resurgence of retail interest has been another pivotal factor in Bitcoin’s recent rally. Cameron Winklevoss, founder of Gemini, observed on X: “The road to $80k bitcoin was paved with steady ETF demand. Not retail FOMO. Little fanfare. People buy ETFs, they don’t sell them. This is sticky HODL-like capital. Floor keeps rising. Where are we in the cycle? We just won the coin toss, innings haven’t started.” Google Trends data supports this narrative, indicating a 53% increase in Bitcoin-related searches since the first weekend of October. On November 10, Bitcoin web searches peaked at 95, up from 42 points at the end of October. This surge in search activity suggests heightened retail interest and potential influxes of new investors into the market. At press time, BTC traded at $81,259.

Its recent triangle breakout rally aims to push the price past the $1 psychological mark. The cryptocurrency is benefiting from positive market sentiment, especially with Bitcoin surpassing the $82,000 level, setting a new all-time high. Cardano has surged by 77% in just one week, climbing from an opening price of $0.334 to a closing price of $0.59.As Cardano breaks through a key resistance trendline, market watchers are anticipating that the bullish momentum could propel the price to $1. Let’s examine the likelihood of Cardano breaking the $1 barrier during this bullish cycle.Cardano's 87% Rise Targets New 52-Week HighOn the daily chart, Cardano is showing a high-momentum reversal with seven consecutive bullish candles. This rally has resulted in an 87% price increase, from a low of $0.32 to the current price of $0.595. Cardano Price Chart The bull run has surpassed the 67.80% level at $0.548 and has faced a higher price rejection from the 78.60% level at $0.69. As the falling channel breakout rally after a small consolidation period gains momentum, the bull run is teasing a new 52-week high formation for Cardano. With the surge in bullish pressure, the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have given a positive crossover, signaling further upward movement. Additionally, the 20-day EMA has crossed above the 200-day EMA, adding to the bullish outlook.Cardano Weekly Price TargetsOn the weekly chart, Cardano's price action formed a symmetrical triangle pattern during the recent pullback phase. Last week, a powerful bullish engulfing candle confirmed the breakout, signaling the continuation of the uptrend. Cardano Price Chart Although Cardano is currently struggling to break above the $0.60 mark, the daily MACD indicator has flipped to a positive crossover, suggesting that the bullish momentum is still intact.Using Fibonacci retracement levels, the next significant resistance level lies at the 23.60% level, around $0.729. A breakout above this level would signal a change in character for Cardano, boosting the chances of the price rallying to the 38.20% level at $1.45.On the downside, key support levels include the $0.50 psychological mark and the broken resistance trendline. A retest and bounce off these support levels would further reinforce the bullish thesis and could trigger a high-momentum rally for Cardano.",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/11/cardano-breakout-sprint-surpasses-0-60-now-targeting-1/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-breakout-sprint-surpasses-0-60-now-targeting-1,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Bitcoin reached a historic milestone this week , rising above $80,000 for the first time. The crypto’s surge came after Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election and as Republicans edge closer to securing control of Congress. This political outcome is influencing market dynamics, with analysts speculating on Bitcoin's next price trajectory. Some predict significant price corrections, while others see potential long-term growth fueled by increasing demand and the possibility of U.S. policy shifts favoring digital assets.Short-Term Bitcoin Corrections Before High TargetsAs Bitcoin crosses new thresholds, industry observers forecast further growth and market corrections. For instance, investor Alistair Milne expects Bitcoin to target $100,000 next. However, Milne warns of a potential 20-25% correction before reaching this level, suggesting that sellers at $95,000 and above may capitalize on the expected dip, leading to short-term price fluctuations. https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/1855650991003095238Analysts observe that despite corrections, continued interest from institutional and individual investors could ultimately push Bitcoin’s price past $100,000, potentially sparking what some call “generational FOMO,” or fear of missing out. At press time, Bitcoin was trading above $80,000. A 25% correction would drive its value back to the $60K range.Long-Term Price TargetIn addition to short-term speculation, some financial leaders are presenting even more ambitious long-term projections for Bitcoin.VanEck CEO Jan van Eck recently voiced his belief that Bitcoin could ultimately achieve $300,000. His forecast is based on Bitcoin’s growing role as “digital gold” and its potential to capture half the market share of gold.Meanwhile, Van Eck clarified that this projection is conservative, noting that some Bitcoin proponents anticipate an even higher valuation. He argues that Bitcoin’s trajectory might surpass his estimate, particularly as demand for Bitcoin-backed products grows.Interest in Bitcoin continues to surge, as indicated by a single-day inflow of $1.37 billion into Bitcoin funds last Thursday.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/11/top-analyst-warns-of-25-bitcoin-dip-before-generational-fomo-drives-btc-past-100k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-analyst-warns-of-25-bitcoin-dip-before-generational-fomo-drives-btc-past-100k,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Market depth remains low on all exchanges with further volatility expected.  A Solana-based memecoin called ""Act I : The AI Prophecy"" (ACT) has risen by more than 1,720% after being listed on Binance and Crypto.com.  The token was initially issued on Oct. 19 and has been languishing around a $20 million market cap over the weekend. The listing led to an explosion of trading volume with $293 million being recorded on decentralized exchange Raydium and $60 million on Binance, its market cap had increased to $422 million at press time.  The rally comes alongside a fresh record high for bitcoin {{BTC}} with the original cryptocurrency trading at $82,120 amid a period of renewed optimism after the U.S. elected crypto-friendly Donald Trump as president. Memecoins have led the market-wide surge this week with dogecoin {{DOGE}} and dogwifhat {{WIF}} rising by 21% and 22% respectively.

42435172,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLJ45,1731323819,Where the Demand Comes From as Bitcoin Breaks Through $82K: Van Straten,"Last week, bitcoin rallied 17%, its second-best week of the year.  Bitcoin's spot volume on Coinbase soared, nearing the March 2024 high.  Exchange balances for the largest cryptocurrency hit a year-to-date low, a sign of increased buying pressure, according to Glassnode data.  Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory sparked a roaring few days for cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin {{BTC}} surging to a record and total cryptocurrency market cap eclipsing $2.7 trillion, a high for the year.  Bitcoin, at $1.16 trillion, is now the ninth-largest financial asset by market capitalization. The biggest cryptocurrency registered its second-best week of the year, rising 17%. That's just shy of the 22% climb in the week ended March 3, according to Glassnode data.  To understand whether the bitcoin could theoretically climb higher or if this marks a local top, it's essential to understand who is buying bitcoin and whether it's a spot or leverage-driven rally.  Coinbase spot volume soars  First, let's consider the spot cumulative volume delta (CVD), which Glassnode defines as ""measuring the net difference between buying and selling trade volumes, specifically highlighting the difference in volume where the buyer or seller was the aggressor. It includes trades where USD or USD-related currencies serve as the quote currency, encompassing both fiat and stablecoins.""  Most of the spot CVD is coming from Coinbase, a crypto exchange widely used by U.S. investors and institutions, and coincides with a spike in the Coinbase Premium Index.  Zooming out over the past three years, it's apparent that when Coinbase CVD spikes, it tends to be near local highs and lows. In March, one of the highest CVD levels occurred as bitcoin broke its then-record high above $73,000. There were also high levels near cycle lows around the Luna and FTX collapse in 2022, which shows smart money buying near the bottom and others buying near the top.  Basis trade or true bitcoin buying  There's been much deliberation about whether inflows into U.S. listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are spot buying alone or if they're part of a strategy known as the basis trade.  The basis trade is a technique for profiting from the discrepancy between spot and futures prices. It involves an investor holding a long position in an ETF while taking a short position in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures market, capturing the price spread.  At the start of the year, when the ETFs were introduced, there were huge inflows. Since then, however, bitcoin has mostly held steady, showing that the ETFs didn't affect the price as much as investors thought, largely due to their operating a delta-neutral strategy.  Last month, the CEO of crypto index provider CF Benchmarks told CoinDesk that ""40% of the ETF inflows were directly down to the basis trade."" However, as the ETF inflows continued to set records, open interest in the CME exchange has not followed suit.  Bitcoin analyst Checkmate has also observed this trend:  ""Spot bitcoin ETF inflows have massively outpaced the growth in CME open interest last week. True directional spot buying has returned. Monday likely to see FOMO and momentum buyers as well,"" they said in a post on X referring to the fear some buyers have of missing out on a rally.  Exchange balance hits year-to-date low  Glassnode data shows that bitcoin on exchanges has hit a year-to-date low at 2.95 million BTC. Since the Nov. 5 election, there's been a reduction of some 40,000 BTC, and demand appears to come from multiple exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, and Bitfinex. Lower balances on exchanges indicate that bitcoin owners are looking to buy more bitcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/11/where-the-demand-comes-from-as-bitcoin-breaks-through-82k-van-straten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/565dbbac077410d37044d59cb4a1fdc4d6996263-1800x1013.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nansen, which allows users to see what's happening in blockchain networks in real time, aims to pave the way for more efficient decision-making in Bitcoin layer 2s empowered by the insights its data and analytics provide, according to an emailed announcement on Monday.  Bitlayer, which raised $11 million in funding led by Franklin Templeton in July, is based on the BitVM computing paradigm, aimed at facilitating Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin.  Provision for smart contracts, which are a key pillar of networks like Ethereum but have been largely absent on Bitcoin throughout its history, allows a network to support blockchain innovations in decentralized finance (DeFi) or decentralized apps (dApps).  BitVM would require a separate auxiliary network atop Bitcoin to handle the volume of transactions, while harnessing the main network's security.  Bitcoin accounts for nearly 60% of the total value of the digital asset market, meaning it is comfortably bigger than every other network put together. Thus, the possibility of Ethereum-style decentralized projects on Bitcoin could unleash liquidity value and liquidity that no other ecosystem can currently come close to matching.

At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $80,944.72, marking a 2.42% increase in the last 24 hours and a significant 17.43% gain over the past week. This price movement has been accompanied by a trading volume of $78.6 billion, further highlighting the strength of the rally.Bitcoin Decoupling from Stocks? Analyst Insights Point to a New TrendAmid this milestone, crypto analyst Tuur Demeester has noted Bitcoin’s shift away from its traditional correlation with the stock market. Demeester’s analysis compares Bitcoin’s performance to the Dow Jones Global Index (DJW) from 2020 to November 2024.The chart captures Bitcoin closing at 123.97 in the DJW index, a 13.32% weekly gain that positions Bitcoin near a long-standing resistance level at 124. Historically, this level has proven challenging to surpass, but Demeester’s insights suggest Bitcoin could be set for a breakout, distancing itself from traditional stock market trends.This trend signifies a potential ""decoupling"" of Bitcoin from the stock market, as noted by Demeester, aligning with the technical breakout seen on the chart.https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1855692180448297338 Bitcoin Attempt at Largest Weekly Candle Amid $81K Surge.Yesterday, as Bitcoin rallied to an all-time high of $81,000, market watcher BTC_Archive highlighted a historic development: Bitcoin was on track to close its largest weekly candle ever, following consecutive days of setting new peaks.Notably, Bitcoin traded as low as $66,000 last week before surging above $81,000. The weekly data shows Bitcoin opened at $68,742 and closed at $80,474.19, reflecting an $11,732 gain.While this is significant, it falls just short of the record set in 2021, when Bitcoin added more than $12,000 in a single week. Bitcoin historical data Historically, large candles with high trading volumes, as seen during the 2017 and 2021 bull cycles, signal heightened interest and sustained upward momentum. This week’s trading volume surge points to renewed buying enthusiasm and bullish sentiment, with volumes reaching levels reminiscent of prior market peaks.$1.29 Billion in Shorts at Risk as Price Nears $85,000Notably, the increased volatility in Bitcoin’s price has placed significant pressure on short positions. Data from Coinglass shows that $84.39 million worth of Bitcoin shorts were liquidated in the past 24 hours.In addition, analyst Ash Crypto highlighted the liquidation risk for short positions, with a potential short squeeze looming. If Bitcoin reaches the $85,000 mark, another $1.29 billion in short positions could be liquidated. This would likely trigger a major short squeeze, adding fuel to Bitcoin’s upward momentum.https://twitter.com/Ashcryptoreal/status/1855841931135275033",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/11/bitcoin-finally-decoupling-from-global-stock-markets-amid-record-weekly-gain-and-81k-surge/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-finally-decoupling-from-global-stock-markets-amid-record-weekly-gain-and-81k-surge,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Back on the campaign trail, now President-elect Donald Trump jumped on the crypto bandwagon, with promises to create a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, fight CBDCs, and defend the right to self-custody. However, the biggest catalyst seems to be his commitment to a favorable regulatory environment and vowing to eliminate ""unclear"" or ""tough"" laws that stifle the sector. Crypto First: Plans are underway to appoint a presidential advisory council to let the crypto industry ""thrive,"" and while there might be some legal tussling, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler may soon find himself out of the position (along with Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown). Trump's sweep in the seven battleground states and the coming ""red wave"" that's set to descend on Capitol Hill will mean that plans can be carried out, with many pro-crypto lawmakers soon to be found in the halls of Congress. The bullish sentiment has even propelled altcoins Cardano ( ADA-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ), as well as meme coins like Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB-USD ), in a broad boost to the entire crypto sector. It'll all translate into better policy certainty, especially for Tier-1 banks, which will be more inclined to integrate crypto services and platforms into their businesses. That should also help more institutional investors come aboard, which can push prices even further via direct buying and a broader range of crypto ETFs. Remember, volatility is always going to be present in the cryptosphere, but history has shown the need for diamond hands to really win in the asset class. Flashback: Trump wasn't always that friendly to bitcoin and was far from being an advocate. During his first term in office, he said crypto value was based on thin air, while connecting the digital assets to crime-riddled scams and threats to the U.S. dollar. Fast forward to the campaign cycle, and Trump was able to distinguish himself from the ""anti-crypto crusade of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris."" At the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in July, he laid out a plan to ""ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and bitcoin superpower of the world.""

Related Reading: Unstoppable Bitcoin: BTC Price Barrels Past $81,000 For New ATH — $82k Now Within Reach Shiba Inu City: An Ambitious Plan In a post, Kusama puts forward his audacious proposal to create the blockchain version of Silicon Valley to allow the blockchain ecosystem to thrive. Kusama called the new city the Strategic Hub for Innovation in Blockchain (S.H.I.B), which he claimed is aligned with Trump’s vision of establishing new technology-centered American cities. Well, would you look at that. Guess my S.H.I.B. proposal was ahead of its time… BY LESS THAN A WEEK. ICYMI https://t.co/pjUBcjgZJ3 A thread🧵 https://t.co/p8wRKhxThh — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) November 9, 2024 In 2023, Trump announced that once he got elected as US president, he will build 10 cities on federal land. He said these will be called “freedom cities”. These new US cities, he pointed out, would give the country a “new American future” after the nation, according to him, has “lost its boldness.” With Trump emerging victorious in the US election, the Shiba Inu creator saw this as an excellent opportunity to push for his proposed blockchain hub. Cost Effective Kusama agrees that transforming one of the American cities and making it a hub for the blockchain industry would be expensive in the short term. The meme coin developer said that establishing the SHIB would cost the US government around $1.3 billion to $2.35 billion and would require five to 10 years to build. However, he noted that the Trump administration should not focus on the short-term expenses but on the long-term economic and geopolitical benefits it will bring to the country. He said that SHIB’s outcomes would offset the cost of building it, explaining that in one to two years, he predicts that the blockchain hub would create 5,000 jobs. The crypto developer added that the project could bring around $500 million into the local economy. It would also attract more than 100 blockchain startups to establish their business in the hub. Kusama said: “By leveraging blockchain’s transformative potential, this S.H.I.B. initiative aims to stimulate economic growth, create high-quality jobs, enhance national security, and reinforce the United States’ leadership in emerging technologies.” Related Reading: $1,400 On The Horizon? Solana Breach Of $200 Excites Analysts A Strategic Investment Kusama sees S.H.I.B. as a project that is transformative for the country, saying that it is a step to allow the US to clinch a strategic advantage in blockchain technology. He predicted that the hub would become a self-sustaining ecosystem that could bring over $5 billion to the US economy every year, adding that it would also bring $500 million in tax revenues annually. The crypto market responded favorably to the plan, pushing SHIB price to hit the $0.00002727 mark — a 23% increase in 24 hours. Kusama believes that the project is a “strategic investment” essential for the country’s future since the proposal would generate significant economic returns and would make the country the leader in blockchain technology. “With the President’s support, we can embark on this transformative journey, ensuring prosperity and security for generations to come,” he concluded.

42435162,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLIJb,1731319950,"Humpy the Whale Cost FTX, Alameda $1 Billion in Losses, Lawsuit Alleges","Compound DAO governance exploiter Humpy the Whale was among the targets of lawsuits brought by FTX’s estate last week.  In 2021 and 2022 he allegedly bought massive amounts of illiquid tokens, pumping the price, and then used them to take out loans on the crypto exchange that were not repaid. He denies the charges.  His actions, which exploited a flaw in FTX's margin trading rules, led to $1 billion of losses for the exchange and Alameda Research, according to the lawsuit.  Among the lawsuits filed last week by the FTX estate is a 32-page document listing eight counts against Humpy the Whale, the crypto trader who earlier this year attracted attention for a governance attack on Compound DAO.  Naming him as Nawaaz Mohammad Meerun, a Mauritian citizen, the suit filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware alleges that between January 2021 and September 2022, Meerun “orchestrated a series of massive market manipulation schemes and defrauded hundreds of millions of dollars from FTX.” It also claims Meerun had connections to organized crime groups. Meerun dismissed the allegations.  “Debtors also have identified extensive ties to Polish, Romanian, and Ukrainian organized crime networks, including groups linked to human trafficking, as well as to Islamic extremist networks linked to terrorist financing,” the filing says.  “All told, FTX and Alameda suffered approximately $1 billion in losses due to Meerun’s crimes, and Meerun has used the proceeds of his exploits to fund a wide range of other criminal activity.”  Massive amounts of tokens  According to the filing, in January 2021, Meerun began accumulating a position in BTMX, an illiquid token, eventually holding around half the supply, and helping drive up the price by over 10,000% in three months. He then allegedly exploited a flaw in FTX's margin trading rules by using his stake as collateral to borrow tens of millions of dollars from the crypto exchange.  “Meerun knew that as soon as his manipulation stopped, BTMX’s price would crash and he would be required to return all of his 'borrowed' assets. But Meerun had no intention of complying with FTX’s rules,” the suit states.  Following failures on FTX's side, Meerun made off with over $450 million from BTMX, according to the filing. FTX personnel tried to cover it up using the “now-familiar course of action” of shifting the losses to sister company Alameda Research.  At the same time, the suit says, Meerun had built a huge short position in MOB, which Alameda also assumed. In an attempt to cover the short position, Alameda purchased significant amounts of the token.  “MOB’s price spiked by 750% during the course of Alameda’s weeks-long buying spree, forcing Alameda to pay significantly inflated prices, and then collapsed shortly after Alameda slowed its buying spree. By the time the dust settled on the BTMX/MOB situation in August 2021, Alameda personnel estimated that Alameda had already lost $1 billion as a result of Meerun’s actions,” the suit states.  Using new accounts and aliases, in August 2021 Meerun repeated the scheme with illiquid tokens BAO, TOMO and SXP, making off with nearly $200 million before FTX cottoned on, the filing says. An alleged attempt to have another go with a token called KNC was caught while still in progress.  The claims are baseless and unsubstantiated, Meerun told CoinDesk in a direct message on X.  ""I have always operated within the parameters set forth by FTX exchange,"" Meerun said. ""I didn't receive any preferential favor regarding my FTX account. It can be proven that deposits I made to my FTX account largely exceeded all my withdrawals. Thus I encountered losses whilst trading at FTX.  ""I have no ties to any organized crime networks, I’m not linked and never financed any extremist or terrorist network.""  Compound DAO  In addition to the supposed links to organized crime — which are not detailed — the filing also highlighted how, as “Humpy the Whale”, Meerun executed a “governance attack” on lending platform Compound Finance using its COMP token, which gives holders the right to vote of governance proposals for the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  “Meerun accumulated significant holdings of the protocol’s governance token and then sought to divert more than $20 million in assets from other protocol users,” the suit says. “Meerun then used his leverage to force a ‘peace treaty’ with Compound in which he received additional payments in exchange for not further seeking to exploit the protocol.”  As Humpy, Meerun submitted a DAO proposal to create a new yield-bearing protocol called goldCOMP using the backing of a group of COMP holders known as the Golden Boys.  Although they blamed a lack of activity and participation in the DAO for making their actions possible, critics dubbed it a governance attack due to the coordinated efforts between Humpy and the Golden Boys in pushing through the proposal. Concerns were also raised about vote manipulation by the proposers, the centralization of control and potential risks of mismanaging the $24 million COMP treasury funds.  Humpy and the collective ultimately agreed to a counter-proposal to create a staking product that distributes 30% of existing and new market reserves annually to staked COMP holders, proportional to their stake controlled by the Compound DAO.  Sam Reynolds contributed reporting to this story.

With the crypto market reaching the $2.7 trillion mark, Bitcoin created a new all-time high near $82,000, resulting in a new altcoin season. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $80,878 with a market cap of $1.6 trillion. With a weekly increase of nearly 20%, BTC's price trend teases a massive surge ahead. Bitcoin Price AnalysisLooking at the daily chart, Bitcoin's price action reveals a breakout from a falling channel, which acted as a flag pattern within the broader bull run of early 2024. Following the breakout, Bitcoin saw a post-retest reversal from the 78.60% Fibonacci retracement level at $67,690.Since then, Bitcoin has surged by nearly 20%, with seven consecutive bullish candles. The price is now heading toward the 1.272 Fibonacci level at $82,663, which could act as the next key resistance. Bitcoin price chart Analyst Warns of ~$1B in Liquidations as Open Interest Nears $50BAmid the bull run, the Bitcoin open interest has risen by 2.59% in the past 24 hours, reaching $49.06 billion. With the volumes crossing above $104 billion with a 53% surge, the broader market sentiments for Bitcoin are extremely bullish. Bitcoin Derivatives Data Over the last 24 hours, $121 million worth of positions in Bitcoin derivatives were liquidated. Short-sellers incurred $84.34 million in losses, while long positions were hit with $37.47 million in liquidations.On Binance, the top traders maintain a long-to-short ratio of 1.50 based on positions, which supports the bullish trend. However, the long-to-short ratio based on accounts is 0.73, suggesting a potential minor pullback.Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently tweeted that nearly $1 billion in liquidations could occur if Bitcoin's price falls to $77,250. This would trigger a cumulative long liquidation of approximately $999.67 million.Will Bitcoin Cross $90,000?As the bull market continues, technical indicators point toward further upside. The 100-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) are signaling a potential positive crossover, while the MACD and signal lines remain in a bullish trend, confirming a ""BUY"" signal.Institutional support is likely to increase, especially with potential U.S. Bitcoin Spot ETFs, which could fuel further bullish sentiment. The strong performance of crypto-related stocks, such as MicroStrategy, also adds to the optimistic outlook. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings are now valued at $20 billion, with MSTR stock climbing 17.42% last week, yielding 100% returns.With a breakout above the 1.272 Fibonacci level at $82,663, Bitcoin could continue its rally toward $90,000. By the end of the year, Bitcoin’s bull run could reach $94,119, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. However, a minor retest of the $80,000 mark is also a possibility.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/11/bitcoin-hits-new-ath-at-81888-market-eyes-94k-with-open-interest-near-50b/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-hits-new-ath-at-81888-market-eyes-94k-with-open-interest-near-50b,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Interestingly, this was only the trader’s first target, as they also provided higher targets that the foremost meme coin could reach in the short and long term. Dogecoin Price To Rise To $3.80 In The Long Term In the TradingView post, Melika predicted that the Dogecoin price could rise to $3.80 in the long term. The crypto trader gave these price targets back in October based on a cup-and-handle pattern forming on Dogecoin’s chart. This is a bullish continuation pattern in which the price rallies after a consolidation phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Enters ‘Second Breakout Of The Cycle,’ Analyst Puts Peak Above $150,000 Back in October, Melika stated that if the handle pattern completes and breaks upward, the Dogecoin price could reach $0.38 and $0.52 as immediate targets. He added that a breakout above the pattern’s neckline could lead to a long-term price target in the $3.80 area, which aligns with higher resistance levels, which he highlighted on the chart. In a recent update on the October post, Melika confirmed that the trade is still active and that the Dogecoin price is heading toward the target. As such, Dogecoin will likely rally to $0.52 soon enough and then $3.80 in the long term. Crypto analyst Dima James also recently highlighted a cup-and-handle pattern that was forming for DOGE, as he predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach $10. The analyst noted that the meme coin has formed this bullish pattern in every market cycle. Dogecoin rallied over 3,300% in 2016 and 12,000% in 2021 after this cup-and-handle pattern formed. DOGE Completes First Weekly Golden Cross In Four Years Self-acclaimed DOGE lead analyst on X Kevin Capital revealed that Dogecoin has completed the textbook weekly Golden Cross for the first time in four years, with the 50 SMA crossing the 200. The analyst noted that this signals that the Dogecoin price will likely rise soon enough. Related Reading: Can The Donald Trump Win Drive Bitcoin Price To $170,000 This Cycle? He further revealed that in 2020, when the Golden Cross happened, the Dogecoin price dipped for a couple of weeks before surging to new all-time highs. As such, he warned market participants to be slightly cautious in the short term since Dogecoin could again experience a correction, just like in 2020. However, he added that if the Bitcoin price decides to maintain its upward trend, then DOGE will also do so. Meanwhile, in another X post, Kevin Capital opined that a Dogecoin price rally to $3.90 in this market cycle looks unlikely. He added that a rise to $1.80 is also a stretch but can definitely happen depending on Bitcoin’s performance in this bull run. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.28, up over 25% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This rise follows a broader market rally, with many assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various meme coins, hitting highs not seen in months. The influx of new funds from institutional and retail investors has been a key driver behind this surge.Once considered a $40 billion ""joke"" project, Dogecoin has seen substantial inflows over the past day, placing it among the biggest gainers. The reasons for this surge range from macroeconomic factors to U.S. political developments and the continued influence of Elon Musk, a prominent Dogecoin advocate. While some analysts question whether the rally is sustainable, others predict a potential market correction once the election-related excitement dies down.Dogecoin Overtakes XRP and USDCDogecoin's meteoric rise has propelled its market capitalization to $41.8 billion, surpassing both XRP and USDC. Daily trading volumes have spiked and weekly metrics show a positive trend. Over the past seven days, DOGE has gained 86%, outpacing many top cryptocurrencies by market cap. Its monthly gains have exceeded 150%, signaling a sharp reversal in the past month.The token’s success has generated widespread attention on social media, with Dogecoin enthusiasts rallying around the asset. Its 24-hour trading volume has surged 192%, reflecting growing market interest.As a result of this rally, Dogecoin is now the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surpassing USDC and XRP, which had ranked higher just a week ago. USDC currently has a market cap of $37 billion, while XRP’s stands at $33 billion. Dogecoin surges 150%, overtaking XRP and USDC | CoinMarketCap Notably, Dogecoin's ability to overtake major projects like XRP highlights the growing influence of meme coins in the current market, which benefit from heightened speculative sentiment.Dogecoin Rally Linked to Elon Musk and U.S. ElectionsAfter trading sideways for several weeks, the “ Uptober” rally helped drive crypto asset prices higher in anticipation of a surge in November. This rally was partly fueled by the growing prominence of crypto in U.S. politics ahead of the presidential election. Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump had voiced support for potential crypto regulations, which many believe could foster innovation in the sector. However, a Donald Trump win resonated better with most market investors.Moreover, Elon Musk campaigned for Trump and planned to work with the administration in charge of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E).

42435168,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLIix,1731309311,Bitcoin Looks Ripe for Price Pullback as $80K Breakout Looks Overstretched: Godbole,"BTC's price rally looks overstretched according to the spread between prices and the 200-hour SMA.  The RSI has diverged bearishly suggesting the upward momentum has exhausted for now.  The broader outlook remains constructive.  Bullish but overstretched. That's how bitcoin {{BTC}} looks on short duration technical charts after Monday's breakout above $80,000.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization soared to nearly $81,800 during the Asian trading hours on Monday, marking a 15% monthly gain, the highest since March, according to CoinDesk data.  Since the recent U.S. elections, bitcoin has demonstrated a textbook ascent, with consistent upswings followed by consolidations, setting the stage for the next leg higher.  But now above $80,000, the rally looks overstretched, as the spread between bitcoin's price and its 200-hour simple moving average has widened to its highest level since early March, when prices suddenly corrected lower by 11% to $60,000.  In technical analysis, a significant gap between the price and the moving average typically indicates that the market has moved too quickly, prompting traders to reassess their positions and possibly take profits.  Further, the 14-hour relative strength index (RSI), a momentum oscillator used to confirm price movements, has shown bearish divergence, creating a lower high that contradicts BTC's new high above $80,000  This bearish divergence suggests that the bullish momentum may have been exhausted for the time being, raising the possibility of an impending pullback.  If prices rollover, the first key piece of support would be the 50-hour SMA at $78,400. Acceptance below the average could open doors to a deeper decline to $75,000.  Note that corrections are a part of a bull market and a potential price decline could recharge bulls' engines for a more long lasting rise to $90,000 and higher.  In other words, the broader outlook remains bullish, with possible resistance at $90,000.

A day after the elections, Bitcoin hit $75k, topping its previous high of $74,797 last March. Bitcoin’s early November price surge isn’t surprising, knowing how Bitcoin and crypto have become a hot election topic. While Democrat Kamala Harris pitched her support for new technologies like AI, Trump was seen as more receptive and favorable to the Bitcoin and crypto community. Bitcoin’s latest surge pushed the asset’s market cap to over $2.7 trillion, data from CoinMarketCap show. Bitcoin Inks Another ATH, Boosts The Crypto Landscape Bitcoin’s bullish price action started last November 5th, when Trump’s numbers showed a convincing win. Earlier Wednesday, Bitcoin’s price hit $75k and soon surged to new highs until, Monday. Bitcoin’s surge also benefited the rest of the crypto industry. For example, with Bitcoin’s price ascent, MicroStrategy’s share price increased, which was confirmed with Coinbase Global. Traders’ optimism is high; even the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 ended the week in black. Trump’s Change In Bitcoin Policy Interestingly, incoming President Trump wasn’t initially keen on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. During his first presidency, Trump labeled these digital assets as scams. However, with his recent public appearances and pronouncements, Trump changed his tune and now shows massive support. In one of his campaign speeches, Trump promised to make the US the Bitcoin and crypto capital of the world. He also enjoys the support of many famous crypto personalities, including Elon Musk.

The price is trading above the $0.2800 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.280 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could continue to rally if it clears the $0.3050 and $0.3120 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes More Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh surge after it reclaimed the $0.200 resistance like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE was able to gain pace for a move above the $0.2200 and $0.250 resistance levels. The pair even surged above $0.3000. A high is formed at $0.3036 and the price is now consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2013 swing low to the $0.3036 high.

If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.3050 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.280 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.2680 level. The main support sits at $0.2550 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2013 swing low to the $0.3036 high. If there is a downside break below the $0.2550 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.2420 level or even $0.2350 in the near term.

Dogecoin and Shiba Inu led the gains among major cryptocurrencies, with dog-themed tokens adding 30% over the past 24 hours.  Market moves follow Donald Trump’s presidential win and anticipation around a strategic bitcoin reserve as per a July campaign promise.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} zoomed above $81,000 late Sunday as a record-setting rally continued into its sixth day, boosting growth across all major and midcap tokens.  BTC added 5.6% in the past 24 hours, data shows, with trading volumes of nearly $100 billion over an unusually wild weekend session. Weekend pumps are generally considered bullish in the crypto market, as trading volumes typically decrease over the weekend when many institutional investors and professional traders are less active.  Futures premiums on BTC-tracked products are soaring, indicating a bias for bullish bets. The popularity of the $80,000 call on Deribit points to potential dealer hedging around the key level.  Dogecoin {{DOGE}} and shiba inu (SHIB) led gains among majors with a price jump of as much as 30%, with DOGE flipping xrp {{XRP}} and stablecoin USDC late Sunday to become the sixth-largest token. DOGE has jumped on renewed endorsements by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, pushing it 88% in the past 30 days.  Other majors took a breather following a Friday rally. Ether {{ETH}}, BNB Chain’s BNB and XRP added under 4%, while Cardano’s ADA saw profit-taking after a 35% move higher on Sunday.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, rose 4.5% in the past 24 hours.  Dog-themed memecoins led gains outside of majors with an average jump of 30%, CoinGecko data shows, followed by Solana-based memes and TokenFi launchpad tokens.  The weekend price action came on the back of a week that saw crypto-friendly Republican Donald Trump elected as U.S. president and a fresh round of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.  Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. recorded over $1.3 billion in net inflows on Thursday, breaking a March record of $1.1 billion, led by BlackRock’s IBIT.

My conviction is high that 2025 will be a year of falling Bitcoin dominance. In terms of financial conditions, there are striking similarities to previous crypto cycles, raising the possibility of a hard landing. The opportunity cost of missing the post-halving-year rally is too high to prepare for the pessimistic scenario. Investors are better off maintaining their bitcoin position. I expect altcoins to outperform bitcoin in 2025, but in the long run, Bitcoin remains the best-performing crypto asset. Bitcoin Hits New All-time-high After Midcycle Correction Since my last article on August 7th, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) seems to have completed its midcycle correction rather quickly and is now approaching the $80,000 mark. Altcoins are still underperforming. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is still well below the past all-time high at ~ $3,000. Current market dynamics are nothing new to seasoned crypto investors, as the cycle is very much in line with previous ones. The times of boredom are long gone. Chances are high for another potential mania phase in 2025. Data by YCharts Bitcoin dominance continued to rise above 60%, as I expected, in my last article. I believe the chances are high that the Bitcoin dominance has either already peaked for this cycle or will peak in November or December 2024. My conviction is high that 2025 will be a year of falling Bitcoin dominance after it rose for three years straight. Furthermore, there are striking similarities to previous financial cycles in terms of financial conditions. While these similarities indicate money printing—inherently bullish for crypto—they also increase the chances of an economic soft or even hard landing before the skies are clear. I argue that betting on a financial market meltdown may make sense at first glance. However, the opportunity cost of missing out on the post-halving-year rally is too great to reflect this view in one's portfolio. Investors are better off maintaining their Bitcoin position, and if their personal risk tolerance allows, increasing their exposure to Altcoins Again, for the sake of transparency—these are my current positions in my crypto portfolio. Positioning of Author (BTCUSD) (TradingView) I am adding ETH for the first time as Altcoin positions will become more important for my positioning for the last two months of this year and for 2025: Positioning of Author (ETHUSD) (TradingView) Mania Speculation Is A Long Way Off Although Bitcoin has hit new all-time highs and the great boredom of 2022 & 2023 is certainly over, I don't think we have seen any speculative mania yet. This is perfectly in line with prior halving-years. The number of unique addresses that were active has dropped in early 2024 and is just starting to turn around from lower levels. The data is polluted by the Bitcoin-ETFs launched earlier this year. However, it does show that the On-Chain movement remains muted. Off-Chain data, similar to the Social Risk Metric , shows similar results. Interest is picking up, but nowhere near the mania-phases that preceded the post-halving years of 2017 and 2021. The data suggests that speculation levels and retail interest will begin to turn around from multi-year weakness in the second half of this halving-year 2024—similar to the prior halving years of 2016 and 2020. Cycle Low Multiple (BTCUSD) (charts.bitbo.io) The current cycle (ERA 4) is pretty much in line with the last two comparable cycles of Bitcoin (ERA 2 and 3). The Cycle-Low-Multiple clearly shows diminishing returns from cycle to cycle which is to be expected for an asset class that is growing in size. In the past cycles mania phases typically began after passing the previous all-time high at ~ 200 days after the halving. They peaked just one year after they started, roughly around 540 days after the halving. If the current cycle were to follow the previous ones, the post-halving year of 2025 should continue to be positive for Crypto assets overall. Interestingly, the midcycle top of the last cycle (ERA 3—green) occurred 300 days before the halving after capitulating in March 2020. The current midcycle top happened much later at 50 days before the halving, similar to the ERA 2 cycle. But these are all nuances. The overarching message is the following: The current cycle is playing out very much in line with the prior cycle—disregarding all other (relevant) metrics discussed below. If history continues like the last 12 years, we have a positive post-halving year ahead of us. The Peak Of Bitcoin Dominance For This Cycle Other significant metrics show similarities too. Correspondingly to prior cycles, the multi-year bull market of Bitcoin Dominance has reached ~ 60%. Excluding Stablecoins Bitcoin Dominance has even reached ~65%. Similar to the stock market where lower risk / higher market cap companies have outperformed over the past three years, Bitcoin has significantly outperformed the average Altcoin throughout the mid-cycle. BTCUSD (orange) & BTC.D (blue) (TradingView) During the mania phases of 2017 and 2021 the Bitcoin dominance plummeted in a single year of speculative mania only to rise steadily for three consecutive years, until the next post-halving year occurred. I believe there are two main reasons for this recurring pattern: The halving and financial conditions. The mechanics of the halving put upward pressure on the price of Bitcoin because of the reduced supply from miners. A year later, with Bitcoin already at new all-time highs, retail steps in to buy the riskier Altcoins, only to get crushed the following three years. Speculation thrives when borrowing money is cheap, and it dries out when money gets tight. The riskier Altcoins underperform, when central banks tighten financial conditions, e.g. with quantitative tightening and restrictive interest rates—hence Bitcoin dominance rises. Typically, after financial conditions have been restrictive for a long-enough period, the market gives in and consolidates. Due to lower asset prices—and/or inorganic monetary easing by central banks—Bitcoin dominance collapses and the cycle begins anew. Of course, the price action of Bitcoin is multifactorial. However, the halving cycle and the financial conditions cycle are positively aligned for the following year of 2025. On the one hand, the halving took place in April 2024, and on the other, interest rates are already falling, and global central banks are discussing monetary easing to support the economy. The perfect breeding ground for a broad-based speculation mania phase, typical of a post-halving year, which would correspond to the halving cycle, falling Bitcoin dominance and easier financial conditions going forward. BTCUSD (orange) & FEDFUNDS (blue) (TradingView) Let's Not Forget The Turbulences Of The Halving-year 2020 While the first few rate cuts of 2019 indicated financial easing, the real stimulus came only after March 2020, when asset prices plunged, the world was in a Covid panic and there was sufficient reason to ease monetary policy significantly—e.g. to finance government handouts. During this time, Bitcoin fell by ~70% and Altcoins declined a bit more on average. Only after the capitulation did the real bull market begin. I believe there stands a good chance of something similar happening, catching many investors off guard. After the prolonged drawdown of 2022, sentiment was incredibly bearish heading into 2023. Despite (or rather because of) the market negativity, assets continued to rally in a near straight line to date, putting in new all-time highs consistently. At the time, talk of an inverted yield curve was the popular bearish narrative. However, after many months of recurring new all-time highs, these arguments have vanished just when they really mattered. It is the uninversion of the yield curve that almost has a near-perfect track record of predicting recessions and huge market drawdowns. SPX (grey) & US02Y/US10Y Spread (blue) (TradingView) Just when it matters most, investors turn their heads to their green screens full of new all-time highs—typical market behaviour. Implications & Positioning Ideas Should investors hedge their crypto portfolio against the scenario of a (hard/soft) landing mentioned above? The answer depends on the investment style, but probably not. The question that every investor needs to ask is the following: Am I willing to sacrifice returns in the crypto asset space during a post-halving year for the possibility of buying later at a lower price if a recession occurs before the bull run? The opportunity cost seems too high to me. The returns of the previous bull runs into the post-halving year have been too great to miss out on. The current market dynamics of falling interest rates, Central Bank easing, peaking Bitcoin dominance, and muted but rising positive sentiment align perfectly with the halving narrative and my experience in 2020. If investors want to hedge some of their risk, a position in leveraged long-term government bonds (e.g. TLT) seems like an acceptable strategy. In the event of a market crash, long-term government bond yields are likely to fall, resulting in greater purchasing power in times of low asset valuation. The risk of rising interest rates due to great fiscal spending and therefore elevated inflation remains. However, long-term government bond yields (and yields in general) appear to have topped out for this market cycle. Personally, I'm toying with the idea of such a hedge against a risky altcoin position, but I haven't implemented it yet. Partly because I don't want to overcomplicate things, partly because of the dangers of elevated inflation & interest rates for such a trade. The Time For Altcoins Is Coming Over the last three years, Bitcoin has been by far the best asset in the crypto space on a risk/reward basis. Altcoins have significantly underperformed, and the Bitcoin maximalist idea has gained a huge following—partly for fundamental reasons, partly because of the stunning effect of green candles. I believe the tide will turn in 2025. The post-halving year could be one of those years when the average altcoin outperforms bitcoin. Make no mistake: I am not arguing that Altcoins will outperform durably over the course of several years. If your investing style is buy & hold, Altcoins don't make sense. They are oscillators to Bitcoin (at best) and tend to outperform only for short periods of time. Additionally, Altcoins are at risk to be replaced by other Altcoins, they are centralized most of the time and vulnerable to human manipulation—all of which Bitcoin is not. However, they typically outperform by a wide margin in the years following a halving—when all the circumstances are right. During a mania phase, investors should remember: Over the long term, there is no better performing asset in the crypto space than Bitcoin. Never marry an altcoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4735952-the-peak-of-bitcoin-dominance-in-2024?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36090100.jpeg

42435157,vcdRFSInNZZ7jTkxATLHuF,1731295800,Ethereum's ENS Identity System Set to Launch Own Layer-2 Blockchain,"The company behind the ENS blockchain domain service has cinched a plan to build its own layer-2 blockchain, dubbed “Namechain.”  Namechain will be a zero-knowledge rollup, and will likely go live around the end of 2025.  ENS Labs, the company behind the Ethereum Name Service, is moving ahead with a plan to launch its own layer-2 network.  Namechain, as the new network is called, should go live around the end of next year, ENS Labs' chief operating officer, Katherine Wu, told CoinDesk. It will use zero-knowledge rollups, a scaling technology that speeds blockchain transactions and reduces the cost of executing them by compressing the amount of data published on-chain.  “This technology allows Namechain to process and execute transactions off of the main Ethereum network while still inheriting the full security of Ethereum, but at a fraction of the cost,” ENS Labs said in a press release Monday.  The new network will leverage the infrastructure of an existing zero-knowledge chain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Wu said. The team is in the final stages of choosing which zkEVM it will use, she told CoinDesk by Telegram.  ENS is blockchain's answer to the web's domain name service. Just as domain names (Amazon.com, WhiteHouse.gov) are human-readable and easier to remember than numerical IP addresses, ENS names are more relatable than crypto wallet addresses. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin's ENS handle, for example, is Vitalik.eth, which rolls off the tongue better than his address (0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045, should you be wondering.)  In May, ENS Labs proposed overhauling the project's registry system by transforming it into an L2. At the time, it had not yet committed to the ZK rollup model.  The overhaul, ENSv2, will see a complete re-architecture of the ENS protocol, as well as its extension onto a layer-2, Wu said.  ""The heavy technical lift here will be in making sure that Namechain is backward compatible with ENSv1 (the current set up on Ethereum mainnet) from day one of launch,"" Wu wrote. ""[To] a user, there should be no difference on the front end/user experience as we launch Namechain, except for lower gas fees.""  ENS’ decision to go ahead with ENSv2 follows a series of other announcements of major crypto firms coming out with their own layer-2 projects. Recently, teams behind decentralized finance project Uniswap, crypto exchange Kraken and Sony’s Blockchain Labs unveiled plans to launch their own rollup networks. Instead of ZK rollups, however, those projects use layer-2 Optimism’s technology, known as the OP Stack, which allows developers to clone its code to create their own blockchains.  “Namechain represents ENS' next evolution, and I'm excited for the huge improvements it will bring in scalability and cost, and the new applications it will enable,” said ENS Labs' co-founder and lead developer, Nick Johnson, in the press release.

36087507,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=652475,1731294978,Bitcoin Price Hits $80K Mark: The Crypto Bull Run Continues,"Bitcoin price is up over 5% and trading above $80,000. BTC is rising and might aim for a move above the $82,000 resistance zone in the near term. Bitcoin started a fresh surge above the $78,500 zone. The price is trading above $80,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $80,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise above the $81,500 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Sets Another ATH Bitcoin price started a fresh increase above the $76,500 level. BTC cleared the $78,000 resistance and traded to a new all-time high. It posted a high at $81,700 and is currently consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $81,500 level. However, the price is still well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $75,785 swing low to the $81,700 high. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $80,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading above $80,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $81,700 level. The first key resistance is near the $82,000 level. A clear move above the $82,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $82,500. A close above the $82,500 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $83,800 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $85,000 resistance level. Are Dips Supported In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $81,700 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $80,250 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $78,750 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $75,785 swing low to the $81,700 high. The next support is now near the $77,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $76,500 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $80,250, followed by $78,750.
