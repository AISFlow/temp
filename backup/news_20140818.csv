42397865,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQLr,1408398313,Coinbase Acquires Block Explorer Service Blockr.io,"Coinbase has acquired Blockr.io as part of an undisclosed deal.  With the move, the San Francisco-based bitcoin financial services startup will add a popular block explorer service to its list of assets. Coinbase already offers merchant processing, secure vault storage and consumer wallet hosting, and extends its presence to yet another vertical with Blockr.io.  In a blog post announcing the purchase, Coinbase cited Blockr.io's sleek, intuitive user interface and API as the chief motivating factors, writing:  ""We’re always keeping an eye out for other companies and individuals making waves in digital currency and helping make bitcoin easy to use. One such company is Blockr.io""  Coinbase adds to core team  Blockr.io  was created by a team of Slovenia-based bitcoin enthusiasts that included software developer Sašo Matejina and designer Samo Drole. Both will join Coinbase as a result of the acquisition.  Matejina and Drole will focus their efforts on further developing the Coinbase API and Coinbase’s own bitcoin node, the company said. Coinbase added that Blockr.io will continue to operate “for now”, though there is no word yet on future development.  Notably, Matejina has a background in automated functional and regression testing for banking software and developed a number of news platforms for Slovenian media. Drole previously worked as a freelance designer.  This is the latest in a series of acquisitions and hirings completed by Coinbase. For example, in May it acquired the development team behind content sharing platform Kippt, while it bolstered its team with industry veterans from Amazon and Facebook earlier this year.  Emphasizing ease of use  Launched last December, Blockr.io conducted extensive beta testing of its platform prior to the sale.  The service features integrated parsers for bitcoin and litecoin, and can be modified to parse any other coin running on a bitcoind fork. Blockr.io also supports automatic scripts using its own API.  The service is designed to allow for ease of use, highlighting the block chain and its data through a clutter-free interface. Users can quickly access addresses, see balances and bookmark or share any information they may find useful with the service.  Blockr.io even includes some fun features, such as a trivia section that lets users track accounts with the most coins or other outstanding characteristics.

42397854,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQD0,1408394143,Academics Call for Revisions to New York's BitLicense Proposal,"The 45-day window for public comments on the New York Department of Financial Services' (NYDFS) recent BitLicense framework continues to shrink, but the barrage of reactions from those with an interest in the industry has yet to lose its momentum.  Most recently, two research fellows from George Mason University's Mercatus Center co-authored a 14-page response to the BitLicense proposal, highlighting some of its most critical shortcomings.  Jerry Brito and Eli Dourado made a point to laud NYDFS Superintendent Ben Lawsky for his department's ""forward thinking"" in outlining rules and regulations specific to virtual currencies, but criticized many of the stipulations found in the BitLicense proposal.  Bitcoin's 'unique characteristics'  Lawsky has stated that the fundamental goal for the BitLicense framework is to ""strike an appropriate balance that helps protect consumers and root out illegal activity ... without stifling beneficial innovation"". Brito and Dourado commend this goal in their proposal, but argue that the BitLicense framework as proposed fails to strike such a balance.  Their response notes that through BitLicenses, the NYDFS aims to develop rules and regulations ""tailored specifically for the unique characteristics of virtual currencies"".  To this effect, BitLicenses mirror similar rules and regulations already in place for traditional money transmitting businesses, but Brito and Dourado say that the BitLicense regulations are often more strict than incumbent money transmitting licenses, defeating the purpose of accommodating to the ""unique characteristics"" of bitcoin and other virtual currencies.  Brito and Dourado argue:  ""The obligations faced by BitLicensees should not be any more burdensome than those faced by traditional money transmitters. Otherwise, the new regulatory framework will have the opposite effect of the one intended [...] If it is more costly and difficult to acquire a BitLicense than a money transmission license, we should expect less innovation.""  Before highlighting specific instances where the BitLicense framework is particularly onerous, the authors praise Lawsky's acknowledgement that the rules of BitLicenses should not be ""so burdensome or unwieldy that the technology can't develop"".  A need for more clarity  Part of the problem with the BitLicense framework as proposed, the authors argue, is that some of the definitions included are so broad that non-financial services like Namecoin would be unnecessarily subject to regulation.  They also highlight the distinction between a web wallet like Coinbase and a software wallet like Electrum; since a software wallet provider like Electrum never holds either the public or private key for its users' bitcoin wallets, they should not be subject to the same regulations as a wallet provider like Coinbase.  Citing the lack of clarity in the current BitLicense proposal, the paper suggests a revision to section 200.2(n)(2) to read:    (2) securing, storing, holding, or maintaining full custody or control of Virtual Currency on behalf      of others;    Brito and Dourado also point to further clarifications that are needed in regard to mining pools and operations, notably the ambiguous language classifying individual miners versus mining pool operations.  Unnecessary stipulations  A major problem with the BitLicense framework as proposed is the inclusion of regulations that puts BitLicensees at a disadvantage compared to traditional money transmitting licensees, the authors argue.  Pointing to examples like the requirement for all employees to submit fingerprints to the NYDFS (for traditional money transmitting licenses, only the applicant must submit fingerprints) and the requirement to collect physical addresses of all parties involved in any transaction, Brito and Dourado criticize the BitLicense proposal as ""impractical and counterproductive"".  They note:  ""As one commentator put it, requiring that Virtual Currency businesses identify all parties to a transaction would be much like requiring Gmail or Yahoo! Mail to identify and gather the physical address of the recipients of the emails their customers send.""  These stipulations neglect to consider the uniquely open nature of a decentralized currency like bitcoin, and as the authors mention, may very well result in stifling innovators who wish to explore the bitcoin market further.  An on-ramp for startups  Brito and Dourado continue to argue that many of the tedious and burdensome regulations that must be met by BitLicensees are more apt for traditional financial firms, not software-focused startup companies.  The authors point to the requirement that changes to business must be approved by the superintendent as particularly troublesome, as constant iteration is essential for startups and business model pivots are not rare for young companies:  ""Indeed, it is unlikely that Silicon Valley would even exist today if entrepreneurs had to receive written approval from regulators every time they wanted to make a material change to their business model [...] The industry has thrived on permissionless innovation.""  Brito and Dourado point out that traditional money transmitter licensees do not face the same requirements for changing their businesses, and that the NYDFS needs to take a more balanced approach in working with startups so that they ""do not have the same compliance expenses that the world’s largest financial firms have on day one of their existence"".  In conclusion, they explicilty commend Lawsky and the NYDFS for proactively approaching bitcoin regulation, but call for further revisions to be made to the BitLicense framework.  The authors suggest an additional 45-day comment window to be instated for final comments to be made on the new draft of the BitLicense regulations, in hopes of finding the right balance between preventing money laundering and fostering innovation in New York state.

42397871,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQQm,1408385158,Russian Tech Magnate's First Bitcoin Project Launches in Beta,"One of Russia's newly minted technology tycoons has unveiled his first foray into the bitcoin world, a bitcoin blockchain visualiser called BlockTrail, that opened for public access today.  Tech magnate Lev Leviev is co-founder of VKontakte, Russia's largest social network, which has 266 million user accounts and more active daily users than Facebook in the country.  He sold his stake in VKontakte last year in a deal that, together with larger chunk of equity from another investor, was valued at more than $1bn. With the proceeds of the sale in hand, Leviev turned his attention to bitcoin, which he discovered last year.  He said:  ""We both got started with bitcoin in 2013 and almost immediately were struck by the potential of this disruptive technology. It was clear that bitcoin needed better tools for its economy to flourish.""  Leviev started what he calls a ""holding company"" for bitcoin projects called BlockCorp along with Boaz Bechar, a longtime friend and technology entrepreneur based in Amsterdam, who is also BlockTrail's chief executive.  BlockCorp invested €500,000 euros in BlockTrail, its first project. The company has other projects in development too, including a mobile messaging application that relies on BitMessage – a decentralised and encrypted messaging protocol that uses a general public ledger similar to the bitcoin blockchain.  A holding firm for bitcoin projects  BlockTrail promises to be the average bitcoin user's 'dashboard' for keeping track of transactions. It also has a social component that links wallet addresses to websites that mention them, such as forums like Bitcoin Talk.  An example of BlockTrail's social dimension at work is the page for a wallet used by the US Marshalls Service to hold some of the bitcoin it confiscated from online black market Silk Road. Alongside the wallet's conducted transactions is a tab for 'mentions'.  The mentions tab reveals a page of links to web pages that have referred to the wallet address. This includes links to pages on Bitcoin Talk, for example. This particular US Marshalls wallet has 61 mentions, according to Blocktrail. The page is also structured with a Reddit-like voting mechanism that allows users to vote for the most salient links.  Crowded analytics space  BlockTrail is entering the increasingly heated space of bitcoin data and analytics startups, where firms are raising millions in funding to turn block-chain data into profits.  Last month New York-based startup TradeBlock, for example, raised $2.8m from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, SecondMarket and Bitcoin Investment Trust founder Barry Silbert, among others, announcing its mission to ""focus on data"" from the blockchain.  Another firm, Coinalytics, is using its backing from Silicon Valley incubator 500 Startups to try to become a ""Bloomberg for bitcoin"", a reference to the financial information giant's hugely profitable data terminal business.  Bechar admits that blockchain data firms aren't exactly an untapped market, but he believes BlockTrail addresses a niche in the market:  ""It is true that quite a few data providers have emerged, but if you look closer, each one is targeting a different niche: Chain.com is building an API for developers, TradeBlock is focused on economic data for professionals, others are working on 'institutional-level' reports for enterprises, banks and government.""  Bechar said his firm's focus is not on the specialised needs of other analytics startups, but on the mass market of bitcoin users. The idea is to offer free visualisation tools to make it easier for the average bitcoiner to make sense of cryptocurrency flows into his or her own wallet, or from major segments of the bitcoin economy like mining pools. This is an area that is currently dominated by Blockchain, the wallet provider that also offers a popular free blockchain explorer.  ""Our approach has been far more consumer-oriented, providing a free online site that enables anyone to view and analyse a bitcoin address, transaction, or other data from the network,"" he said.  Free to use  Bechar wouldn't say how he plans to generate revenue from BlockTrail, although he said he is committed to keeping the service free. Competitors like TradeBlock, for example, have said they plan to charge its users for access. Bechar said he aims for BlockTrail to become the ""authoritative"" source for information on cryptocurrency networks by the year's end.  For Bechar and Leviev, the long-term promise of bitcoin lies in its technology, not its potential as a currency, Bechar said. That's what their incubator, BlockCorp, will focus on in the coming months.  He added:  ""We are both excited to build services in this industry. As the African proverb says: If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.""

42397872,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQRl,1408380945,Price of Bitcoin Drops Below $400 in BTC-e Flash Crash,"The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) has declined more than $60 today (by the time of publication), falling to a low of $435.60. However, a more serious decline was observed at one major bitcoin exchange.  The development is the latest blow to the price of bitcoin, which had slumped to its lowest level since May late last week. The decline has since been largely attributed to a worsening short-term news outlook, as well as the industry's margin traders, though alternative theories have been proposed.  At press time, at least one notable industry analyst, along with a host of exchange users are suggesting that margin trading may have once again played a factor in today's decline, as a flash crash observed on popular bitcoin trading platform BTC-e caused the price of bitcoin on its exchange to decline sharply to a low of $309.  That price was observed on BTC-e at roughly 07:36 (UTC), and was followed by similar declines across other major bitcoin trading platforms including Bitstamp, Huobi and OKCoin, market analysis shows.  Notably, this is not the first time such a large flash crash has been observed on BTC-e. For example, this February, the price on the exchange declined nearly $500 in just over one minute.  Ripple effect  Data analysis shows other major exchanges soon responded to declining prices observed on BTC-e, with a sharp drop observed across their order books at roughly 07:37 (UTC).  By 07:46, the price of bitcoin on Bitstamp began its decline, landing roughly $20 below its starting point to touch $462.01 and hitting a daily low price of $442 at roughly 08:51.  Major China-based Huobi and OKCoin also recorded less notable drops during this time. For example, Huobi's price decline began at 07:37, dropping from ¥2880.1 to ¥2788.1 by 07:45. Likewise, OKCoin saw prices on its exchange fall from ¥2880.4 at 07:36 to ¥2785.3 by 07:45.  At press time, China's markets were down roughly 6% for the day to reach ¥2,832.27, according to the CoinDesk Chinese yuan BPI.  Link to margin trading  In a new post on his quantitative analysis blog Matlab Trading, margin trading critic Raffael Danielli was quick to assert that the practice was chiefly behind today's market movements. BTC-e began offering margin trading to its customers last November.  Danielli told CoinDesk:  ""We have seen crashes like this before and they follow a certain pattern, namely a sharp drop followed by a swift rebound to about a bit less than the previous level.""  Danielli has been vocal in his belief that margin trading contributed to last week's decline, and has been critical of major exchanges, which he claims have remained opaque about the internal safeguards they use to flag suspicious orders that could be influencing price.  Still, Danielli was quick to temper his comments by indicating that there is a lack of information available for the market to reach any conclusion, saying:  ""Just to be clear: the only people who really know what happened are the ones operating the exchange. What we observe here is only the tip of the iceberg and we lack many pieces of information that the exchange has.""  Other market observers suggested the overall weak market contributed to the situation on the exchange. Independent investor Tuur Demeester told CoinDesk:  ""I think BTC-e was the final drop, but the sell off would not have happened if the bidding on markets wasn’t weak either.""  Exchanges respond to critics  Major bitcoin exchanges have remained in favor of margin trading, suggesting they do their best to inform traders of the risks associated with the offerings and that they have internal safeguards to mitigate wider market damage that could result from the practice.  Notably, Bitfinex vice president of business development Josh Rossi took to Reddit on Friday to respond to user questions and give the exchange's official take on the day's events.  Speaking to CoinDesk, both Bitfinex and OKCoin responded to Danielli's criticisms, citing competitive interests as the motivating factor behind not being fully transparent about these policies.  ""If it becomes public knowledge traders can use it to their advantage and find out ways to get around our preventative measures,"" said OKCoin's manager of international operations Zane Tackett.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.

42397860,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQGw,1408376131,CFPB Warning Ignores Bitcoin’s Consumer Protections,"Last week's advisory from the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) warning consumers about the risks of virtual currencies such as bitcoin diligently listed several obvious risks, but simultaneously omitted the very consumer protections provided by certain cryptographic monies.  Citing malicious hackers, potentially high mark-up fees, exchange-rate volatility, lack of governmental insurance, and risk of private key loss is laudable given that so few market participants conduct proper due diligence before jumping in to a new alternative. The majority of companies involved in the bitcoin ecosystem have been highlighting these risks for years.  To be fair, the CFPB charter may not include stressing the particular benefits of some payment methods over others. However, when the words 'financial protection' are in your agency's official name, it appears disingenuous to intentionally omit features from what may be one of the world's most protective financial instruments ever designed.  Who benefits most?  Bootstrapping a competing free-market alternative in a field of national currencies with so many pre-existing and unfair legal tender advantages resembles the solving of the great chicken-or-the-egg debate: which came first, the merchant or the consumer?  A recent New York Times article on bitcoin merchants sparked an instructive debate about whether bitcoin was mostly a payment method benefiting merchants or if consumers also gained substantial benefits from the digital currency.  Merchants need an incentive to accept the new currency before consumers can spend the new currency. And similarly, consumers need reasons to hold the new currency before merchants can accept it. The CFPB advisory warning does little to instill confidence in the latter.  Therefore, in order to better assist consumers, I will describe some of bitcoin's superior attributes in the area of financial protection:  1. Protection from counterfeit bank notes  As the most counterfeit-proof currency in existence today, bitcoin protects consumers from the risk of accepting or receiving counterfeit bank notes in commerce, which continues to plague the world's fiat note issuers. By virtue of the innovative bitcoin block chain, transactions are chronologically recorded in a shared database preventing double-spending and it is computationally impractical to modify once recorded in the chain.  2. Protection from financial surveillance  Just as massive digital surveillance of our email correspondence, telephone conversations, instant messaging, and web surfing habits has escalated in the last 20 years, so has surveillance of our income, spending, and financial transactions. Individuals and corporations are under the financial microscope now more than at any time in history – a fact that has significantly eroded any remaining vestiges of financial privacy. As we move from a paper money world to a digital money world, maintaining our analog equivalent rights becomes a necessity.  Governments crave this information in the name of preventing money laundering, fighting terrorism, collecting taxes, and fighting the drug, gambling and pornography wars. Bitcoin restores the balance with financial privacy and financial sovereignty by placing responsibility for how transparent we want to be in the hands of the user where it belongs, hence user-defined privacy. This is also permission-less privacy and, if opted for, it includes total balance privacy in addition to transaction date, type, amount, and recipient privacy.  3. Protection from identity theft  Bitcoin provides excellent protection from both identity theft and fraudulent charges, primarily because it functions as a push-method rather than a pull-method for personal financial details. Since account details and identity are not transferred to the merchant for payment purposes, the potential for malicious hackers and internal corporate security breaches are reduced to zero. With current payment methodologies, however, identity theft and resulting consequences to the victims are significant negative issues.  4. Protection from physical loss of assets  In this sense, bitcoin is virtual, however the comparison is to trusting the safekeeping of your assets to a third party like a financial institution or wallet provider. Of course, when utilizing a third-party, a host of new risks is introduced which government regulation and government deposit insurance seek to address. But, not using bitcoin because it doesn't come with government assurances is like not flying because you might fall out of the sky.  Bitcoin possesses the option of simply not having to trust a third-party intermediary and, in this way, it resembles a digital bearer instrument such as gold or paper cash. However, bitcoin's unique exceptions include the ability to safely backup your assets multiple times and to transfer them digitally without sacrificing their bearer nature.  5. Protection from cross-border restrictions and excessive fees  Some money services businesses and financial institutions charge exorbitant fees just to execute a simple monetary transfer often preying upon those that are most financially vulnerable. Other countries severely restrict the amount and type of national currencies that may enter their borders causing hardship for many American citizens and residents needing to transfer living funds to family members overseas. Without requiring an intermediary, bitcoin insulates individuals and businesses from these detrimental restrictions and fees.  6. Protection from payment blockades  Blockades such as these are typically enacted in the name of 'political correctness' as witnessed by the aggressive payment blockade against WikiLeaks in 2011. As the US government leaned strongly on payment processors Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal to discontinue donations to the whistle-blowing site, donations in bitcoin continued to provide a valuable method for WikiLeaks to maintain an ongoing financial stream for operations.  7. Protection from government-sponsored inflation  As the so-called 'hidden tax', inflation represents one of the most insidious methods ever devised by governments to boost their wealth at the expense of the fleeced middle-class. Without significant assets to appreciate and keep pace with government-induced inflation, it is the poor and middle-class that suffer the most during inflation, despite the fact that the decline in purchasing power may only be noticeable over a longer time horizon. Bitcoin, with its fixed and predictable supply, provides a store of value alternative to the currency of nations with printing presses run amok.  8. Protection from confiscation  Arbitrary and capricious confiscation of assets has emerged as a new trend among debt-saddled countries in the euro zone. Cyprus and Spain are two examples, but any government with control over its banking system assets has the potential to enact a 'deposit levy' or a 'wealth tax' if revenues from taxation are insufficient to meet ongoing government obligations. The protections afforded by bitcoin in this area prevent loss of wealth due to random government asset seizures.  Let the buyer beware  Today, I was reminded that Confucius once said: ""The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name."" So, let's not forget the ongoing bitcoin word game played by governments and other wordsmiths.    Confucious said, “The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name.” - See more at: http://blog.gryfencryp.to/2014/08/17/cryptocurrency-and-the-return-to-free-markets/#sthash.v7h8EVMU.dpuf      Confucious said, “The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name.” - See more at: http://blog.gryfencryp.to/2014/08/17/cryptocurrency-and-the-return-to-free-markets/#sthash.v7h8EVMU.dpuf      Confucious said, “The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name.” - See more at: http://blog.gryfencryp.to/2014/08/17/cryptocurrency-and-the-return-to-free-markets/#sthash.v7h8EVMU.dpuf      Confucious said, “The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name.” - See more at: http://blog.gryfencryp.to/2014/08/17/cryptocurrency-and-the-return-to-free-markets/#sthash.v7h8EVMU.dpuf    While we should definitely heed the risks within a digital currency environment, just as we heed the risks inherent with physical money, we should be equally aware of the additional financial protections provided by bitcoin that are so critical for maintaining a free society.

42397852,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQB2,1408372513,Security Firm Claims New Leads in Search for Missing Mt Gox Bitcoin,"A Tokyo-based bitcoin security consultancy revealed today it has been actively investigating the disappearance of 850,000 BTC from Mt Gox ""for the past few months"".  Given full access to official records, it says, it could potentially reveal much more of what actually happened at the ill-fated exchange.  The company, Wiz Technologies, has been ""unofficially and independently"" analyzing data using a partially complete database of all Mt Gox's historical trading data that it reconstructed from various public and other available sources.  Wiz's founder and 'chief hacking officer' J. Maurice told CoinDesk that his team wished to present its preliminary findings to Mt Gox bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi, in the hope of being assigned an official role in the investigation.  He said:  ""We're the only exclusively-bitcoin security consultancy working in Tokyo, so we're the only ones really qualified to investigate this sort of case. We're in the right place, with the right people and the right skills.""  More information needed for full analysis  Although Wiz has spent months analyzing the ""ticker tape of Mt Gox trades"" in its unofficial database, it still needs access to the complete, official database that is currently only accessible to Kobayashi's team and the Tokyo Metropolitan police.  That database would include personally identifiable customer information and bitcoin addresses, allowing Wiz to reconcile their existing knowledge with the actual bitcoin block chain, and likely reveal more information about the missing 850,000 BTC that led to Mt Gox's abrupt shutdown in February.  Wiz's unofficial trading database was built from sources including trading data leaked after the shutdown, real name and account ID information leaked from an earlier Gox hack in 2011, lesser-known third-party sites that logged trading data, plus other, assorted pieces of data the team gleaned from sources via Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  Maurice added:  ""There's a lot of huge stuff that's going to come out, and this is just the beginning.""  The bitcoin security consultants  Maurice rose to prominence last May, when he played an essential role in defending Roger Ver against the infamous 'ransom' hack attack. The Wiz Technologies team also includes lead engineer Kim Nilsson, who heads the technical investigation in this case, and attorney Daniel Kelman, who takes care of legal matters and has been at the forefront of the Gox case on behalf of its creditors.  Although Tokyo detectives posses the official database and have been conducting their own investigation into the case, their more limited knowledge of and experience with bitcoin's inner workings could slow their progress, Maurice said.  Wiz has formed several theories about what happened at Mt Gox and how bitcoin's largest ever heist was executed, but all its findings remain unconfirmed until it can access all records.  Maurice stressed that Wiz would not charge a fee to Mt Gox creditors and would find external sponsors to finance any official investigation.  The return of Willy and Markus, the Gox trading bots  The most thorough records of Mt Gox's trading history were obtained when Japanese hacker 'nanashi' (Japanese for 'anonymous') posted trading data up to November 2013 on the homepage of CEO Mark Karpeles.  From this data, another anonymous researcher wrote the now-famous Willy Report. This report identifies the bizarre trading activity of two specific Mt Gox accounts, dubbed 'Markus' and 'Willy'.  Beginning Valentines Day 2013, Markus traded erratically at seemingly bizarre prices until September, when the account shut down. Seven hours later, the 'Willy' account was created.  Willy exhibited less attention-grabbing behavior, but was systematic and appeared to be a bot, or trading algorithm, always trading at market prices in random amounts within set limits. It would trade at regular intervals of a few minutes before going dormant.  The truth is already out there  Maurice said the information about the Mt Gox theft that this report reveals has been out in public for some time, but its complex and technical nature mean few have actually read the Willy Report completely or understood its true implications.  Both unusual accounts, he said, were likely created by someone associated with the disappearance of the 850,000 BTC. The hacker had access to Gox's inner workings and was able to compromise its database by creating new accounts and setting fake balances ""with money that didn't exist"".  Between them, the Markus and Willy accounts are shown to have 'bought' hundreds of thousands in bitcoin before November 2013, when the leaked data ends.  Wiz would have to see the full records to determine what happened to those bitcoins once Markus and Willy were finished. Whether it was later withdrawn, and where it might have gone, is yet to be ascertained. The first step of any official investigation would be to uncover those basic facts.  ""We can see every trade that happened within the Mt Gox system, but once it left we can't see where it went,"" Maurice concluded.

The exchange says the new pages offer a new way of donating money that allows charities to receive 100% of donated funds.  All donations show up in real-time in the transaction stream and the funding goal is updated automatically. Safello says the new service will enable small, local charities to create a global fundraising campaign in mere minutes.  Free fundraising tool  Frank Schuil, co-founder and CEO of Safello said the new donation pages demonstrate the power of bitcoin in a tangible way, as they allow people from all corners of the world to unite and fund various causes at virtually no cost.  Schuil explained:  ""Our goal is to make bitcoin fundraising a fundamental source of income for these and other charities by connecting them to audiences they may otherwise not reach. The variety in campaigns [shows] how widely applicable this is and we hope to spark a wave of pages to introduce a new way of donating to the charities we all care about.""  Charity experiment  Safello teamed up with three charities for the launch: LiveBuild, Shifo and the Lifeboat Foundation.  The Livebuild Ntisaw campaign aims to raise 25 BTC (almost $12,000 at the time of publication) for a local school in Cameroon. It will help the school fix its leaky roof and construct four additional classrooms, a library and new toilets.  Koen van Bremen, founder of LiveBuild, said he believes bitcoins will become an important method of payment in Africa in the future.  Shifo’s Every Child Countshttps://safello.com/donate/shifo campaign has a fundraising goal of 20 BTC, which will be used to vaccinate children in Uganda and help improve child health through systematic registration and vaccination follow-up.  “100% of funds raised [within the] bitcoin community will go to the cause, and for every bitcoin, Shifo will provide impact reports,"" said Shifo co-founder Nargis Rahimi.  The Lifeboat Foundation is also trying to raise 20 BTC, which will be used to provide bounties for developers who can come up with fixes for bitcoin-related bugshttps://safello.com/donate/lifeboat.  Safello said the pages are an “experiment” to see how quickly the funding goals can be reached. The service is currently in beta, but interested parties can sign up for early access.

42397870,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQPn,1408354632,"BTC China Launches iOS Apps, Reduces Fees","Exchange BTC China has relaunched the iOS version of its mobile exchange app, called simply 'BTC China', internationally on Apple's App Store.  Furthermore, an iOS version of the company's wallet and person-to-person bitcoin trading app 'Picasso' is also awaiting approval by Apple, and will feature lowered sending fees.  The new iOS exchange app is largely aimed at traders and has all the features currently present in BTC China's cross-platform HTML5-based offering, which was released in late July.  These include live candlestick, market depth and trade history charts, and user interface improvements including a redesigned trading interface and a dark, more eye-friendly theme. The app supports three currency trading pairs: BTC/CNY, LTC/CNY, and LTC/BTC.  Wallet app awaits approval  While the newer Picasso app awaits approval, the BTC China exchange app includes a link to the current version.  Picasso is the exchange's wallet app with a focus on regular spending. It also features an integrated 'sell for cash' feature that allows everyday people, business owners and shopkeepers to fulfil similar functions to bitcoin ATMs without requiring additional hardware.  The apps users have access to live price charts and can set their own trading commissions to sell bitcoins for cash.  It can take up to three weeks for a mobile app to be accepted for inclusion in the iOS App Store, with Apple also deciding in which countries' stores it may be sold.  Reduced fees and confirmation times  To coincide with the release of Picasso for iOS, BTC China has reduced transaction fees. Starting 11th August, the fee for sending bitcoin to an external address from a user's Picasso wallet has been lowered to 0.0001 BTC (about 5 US cents at time of publication) per transaction – down from 0.0005 BTC per transaction.  Sending bitcoin to other Picasso accounts remains free, with the funds being transferred instantly.  Additionally, to speed up the user experience, only two confirmations are needed for bitcoins to be sent to a user's Picasso address from an external address. Previously, the app required five confirmations.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/18/btc-china-launches-ios-apps-reduces-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/545732af93db9cbc58b6dca7c2e172f09c2c6b3d-1260x945.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
