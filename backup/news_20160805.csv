42426984,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyNlh,1470434513,What the Bitfinex Hack Means for Bitcoin Multi-Sig Security,"""With our BitGo wallet solution it becomes impossible for our users to lose their bitcoins due to us being hacked or stealing them.""  So wrote Bitfinex CFO Giancarlo Devasini about the bitcoin exchange's then-new multi-signature security architecture roughly a year before $60m was stolen in one of the industry's highest-profile hacks this week.  While we know that multi-sig accounts were impacted by the hack (which doesn’t look good for the security feature), it's still unclear exactly how this breach occurred. Still for many it begs the question, what does this breach mean for multi-sig technology, an innovation often heralded as the future of bitcoin security?  Thursday, the co-founder and CEO of the industry's largest multi-sig provider BitGo, Mike Belshe, provided an update on the situation, explaining that his startup's software ""functioned correctly"" during the incident. Further, both companies in the partnership have now said that BitGo, and its multi-sig solutions, were not at fault.  But for many, that answer isn’t enough. In the court of public opinion, the verdict as to who – or what – should carry the blame is still out.  Those working closely with multi-sig technology argue it shouldn't be the scapegoat, and that it still should form a core part of exchange security.  Former BlockTrail business development lead Jop Hartog, whose firm offered multi-signature wallets prior to its acquisition this year, said he believes exchanges should still consider the technology, but that they need to understand it's not a single solution.  ""Exchanges should [use multi-sig], and should look for a proper solution for their risks, once they know what they want to have, then go look for a partner,"" he told CoinDesk.  Hartog added:  ""Multisig is the only way forward with current exchanges, but it depends on the implementation to be secure.""  The argument is multi-signature offers a flexible security model with many different configurations, as funds cannot be spent unless two or more users sign the transaction.  However, what the incident might have exposed is that this technology is only as strong as its supporting infrastructure. For Adamant Research's Tuur Demeester, the incident is a sign of the tech's maturation process.  ""You think you have the silver bullet and it turns out to be more complicated than you thought,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Multi-sig has gotten a blow, it has to be rethought.""  Secure multi-sig  In Bitfinex’s case, two particular configurations were used.  Users who were lending or borrowing for the purposes of margin trading had three keys distributed, with one to Bitfinex, one to BitGo and one to the user. Users who were trading had a different arrangement, where two out of three parties needed to sign to release the funds. BitGo had one of the keys and Bitfinex had two.  As previously profiled, it appears that Bitfinex's key was compromised, but that BitGo didn't necessarily detect the unusual actions that would have been required to drain the exchange of nearly one-sixth of its monthly volume with speed.  According to Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at non-profit advocacy group Coin Center, Bitfinex could have used multi-sig in a way that didn’t expose this vulnerability. (BitGo is among Coin Center's public donors).  In a detailed blog post yesterday, Van Valkenburgh described one secure scenario where every customer is given ""unilateral ability"" to access their funds, but that in the event that the customer loses one of the private keys, the exchange, or other service-provider, has a recovery key available.  ""If the service provider is hacked, the only keys compromised are the single backup keys,"" he wrote. ""To actually steal the bitcoins, the hacker needs to also target and compromise every individual customer — a substantially harder task than compromising one server.""  Despite some concerns that cold storage (where bitcoins are kept offline and not in wallets connected to the Internet) was a better option, Van Valkenburgh writes that multi-sig offers a different type of security.  One isn’t necessarily superior, he asserts.  ""I could put keys to a pooled wallet on a USB drive and hide it in my five-year-old niece’s dollhouse. That storage is cold (the dollhouse doesn't have Wi-Fi) but it's also a terrible idea,"" he wrote.  Still, Demeester noted that multi-sig has inherent limitations as well.  ""The problem with multi-sig is you can have insiders steal, and you can have people be imposters who pretend to be one or multiple of the multi-sig parties,"" he said.  Combined solutions  On the other hand, the security technologies aren't mutually exclusive.  Demeester suggested older solutions like cold storage, and bleeding-edge technologies like the Bitcoin Lightning Network, are likely to gain more attention in the wake of the attack.  Former Blocktrail CTO Ruben de Vries told CoinDesk that the most secure option is to combine multi-sig with cold storage:  ""Obviously a combination of cold storage and a multisig wallet is superior to just either one of them. It's unfortunate that Bitfinex made the choice not to have any cold storage for unknown reasons.""  Bitfinex moved away from a cold storage model last year, and some have speculated that this change could have been triggered by an enforcement action from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in which it was forced to change how it ""delivered"" customer funds.  It's notable that exactly how this changed the exchange's infrastructure is not known, and that it's also the matter of a petition from a prominent law firm seeking for the CFTC to disclose this information.  Rodolfo Novak, CEO and founder of the multi-sig wallet Coinkite, contends that hardware security modules, or devices that store the digital keys, could have mitigated the issue.  ""The employment of HSMs is the only sane way of managing funds. If Bitfinex had an HSM on their end, [they] would probably have been able to stop the transactions much sooner,"" he said.  Impact unknown  The consensus seems to be that while multi-signature adds security, it’s best used with other technologies and secure equipment.  On that note, Belshe said yesterday that BitGo’s other exchange partners – including major exchanges Kraken and Bitstamp – are using different implementations of its software.  ""Fortunately, the Bitfinex configuration was unique and other BitGo customers do not need immediate changes,"" he said.  Belshe writes that the hack should be seen as an opportunity for exchanges to carefully inspect their security models, so that the ecosystem can move forward from this latest step back.  However, whether multi-sig solutions offered by BitGo or others will be a part of that strategy, remains to be seen.  Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

42427000,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyOFh,1470431680,Deloitte Imagines Bitcoin Betting in Stadiums of the Future,"A new paper from Deloitte re-imagines the sports stadium concept in light of a number of developing technologies.  Notably, Deloitte gives the example of a fantasy sports-style interaction — a ""game within the game"" — where bets are placed using bitcoin ""on in-game events, or use stadium-provided technology for other micro-transactions"".  The consultancy sees the sports stadium experience as one ripe for technological innovation, building on what's already taking place on the court or field.  The paper explains:  ""While a team is focused on delivering the best possible game experience to its fans, it can’t be all things to all people. Giving developers access to stadium infrastructure allows the team to benefit from the creativity of many.""  The authors propose the development of a sports stadium that is more than a “concrete donut”, but rather a technology stack comprised of an experience layer, an enabling tech layer and a technology infrastructure layer.  By opening the stadium’s technology infrastructure to third-party developers, according to the paper, new services could be offering using blockchain and other nascent technologies.  Deloitte compares the idea of building a wide range of applications for stadiums to Apple’s development of its own hardware-as-a-platform for software products, which last year was a $6bn-a-year business in net revenue for the technology giant.

42426988,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyNth,1470426102,"With Socialized Loss Proposal, Bitfinex Enters Uncharted Waters","The Bitfinex hack appears to be forcing the exchange to consider unconventional measures as part of a bid to relaunch after last week's $60m hack.  The Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange announced last night that it is ""leaning towards"" a scenario that would see it socialize losses among bitcoin users and margin traders with BTC/USD positions. While not ""set in stone"", the idea that users could potentially share losses equally has nonetheless prompted speculation given the perceived impact the exchange's ultimate closure could have on both the price of bitcoin, and its perception as a technology among the general public.  In the wake of the statement, market observers are attempting to assess the nature of the approach and whether it will be enough to resolve the issues at the exchange, one of the largest on the bitcoin network by volume prior to its shutdown.  Speaking to CoinDesk today, representatives of the ecosystem's trading and exchange communities agreed that this would mark one of the first times, if not the first time, a socialed loss proposal would be implemented in the wake of a hack at a major digital currency exchange.  Michael Moro, CEO of OTC trading firm Genesis Trading, told CoinDesk:  ""I can’t think of another situation in which something similar has been proposed in digital currency.""  While the idea appears to be in its early stages, market observers did emphasize that by taking funds from all its bitcoin users – even those whose funds are potentially still under the exchange’s control – and redistributing them, Bitfinex was moving into territory that was largely without past precedent.  Experienced market observers as diverse as Whale Club community admin BTCVIX, HaoBTC director of marketing Eric Mu and blockchain consultant Antony Lewis, for example, struggled to recall another similar instance, as did others when reached.  Still, some suggested such a scheme may be the only path forward for keeping the exchange online.  ""I think it may be necessary evil to avoid a Mt Gox-style shutdown,"" Mu said.  Indeed, at press time, there remains a lack of clarity as to what the exchange means by ""socialized loss"", whether it could be legally implemented or if Bitfinex would face any potential liability should certain aggrieved parties take action if it pursues the plan.  Past precedent  Still, others noted that similar actions have been taken by smaller exchanges in the past on rare occasions, and that some, have even been successful in efforts to relaunch.  Adamant Research's Tuur Demeester noted that, while the definition was not used at the time, the situation bears a resemblance to actions taken by digital currency exchanges like Poloniex and Bitfloor in the past.  For example, Poloniex moved to pay back exchange users in 2014 after it lost 12.3% of all its bitcoins in a hacking incident. In this case, Poloniex would go on to repay customer claims in a matter of months, eventually rising from a relatively unknown platform to the largest ethereum exchange by trade volume.  Of note, is that Poloniex, however, does not offer fiat currency trading, while Bitfinex does.  Another reference point was an incident on China-based exchange Huobi’s margin trading platform, BitVC, in 2014, when it garnered criticism for socializing user losses.  But for some, this comparison doesn’t describe the current situation at Bitfinex given that, in this instance, users were opting into an agreement and accepting the risk of a socialized loss in exchange for the potential gains offered by higher margins.  ""This is completely different than the high leverage socialized loss futures contracts,"" BTC VIX said. ""[These firms] have an insurance fund that buffers those times they incur a loss and that often covers the system loss.""  Legal uncertainties  Still, many market observers have questions about whether the exchange could legally implement such a measure. Legal experts suggested that, while the market may be looking for easy answers, these may be speculative at best for now.  For example, Bitfinex's terms of service state that it was formed under the law of the British Virgin Islands, meaning any lawsuits could take place in this jurisdiction. At press time, Bitfinex's terms of service were no longer available online, though a cached version can be found here.  One legal expert, speaking on background, said that while it remains to be seen whether Bitfinex or its security partner BitGo will be sued, both could face liability even if it’s not immediately clear who would sue or where the lawsuit would be filed.  ""BitGo’s terms of service have a mandatory arbitration clause, Bitfinex has a class action waiver, there are all sorts of impediments to bringing claims,"" he said, adding:  ""But, just because you have terms doesn’t mean they will be enforced.""  Digital currency advocate and trial lawyer Drew Hinkes emphasized that the terms of service for the companies would be of key importance.  He noted Bitfinex's terms of service call for mandatory arbitration and feature a broad definition of loss and force majeure.  ""This would create some challenges for a party wanting to bring a claim,"" he said.  'Wild West' return  Most respondents interviewed had a number of unresolved questions about how the situation would develop going forward, though there were some commonalities.  For instance, there was uncertainty as to whether authorities would get involved, and if they did, whether they would allow the exchange to continue operating and move forward with a repayment plan.  The exchange is said to be in contact with authorities, but at press time, representatives of Bitfinex haven't offered clarity as to which are involved.  Indeed, commentary often devolved into some of the more existential questions facing the bitcoin ecosystem, those related to the intent of the technology and its ability to succeed on the vision for finance it has popularized.  Indeed, the irony that bitcoin’s technology is facing security concerns due to the use of traditional financial models by its startups was not lost on market observers. Financial Times writer Izabella Kaminska, for example, used her particular acerbic brand of reporting to raise these pertinent questions.  However, it seems even bitcoin entrepreneurs are finding overlap with her insights.  Andrea Medri, CFO of bitcoin exchange The Rock Trading, said he is still wondering why so much bitcoin was being kept on the exchange.  ""The beauty of this technology is that you can be your own bank and leave your assets with an intermediary such as an exchange for few minutes only,"" Medri said, concluding:  ""People need to realize that they don’t need custodians any longer.""

42426985,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyNnh,1470414940,Singapore Central Bank Adds Blockchain CEOs to Advisory Panel,"Some of the most recognizable leaders in the blockchain industry have agreed to participate in a newly launched advisory panel organized by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).  Included on the regulatory authority and central bank's 15-person International Technology Advisory Panel (ITAP) is CEO of Digital Asset Holdings, Blythe Masters; CEO of SolidX, Daniel Gallancy; and managing director of R3CEV, Tim Grant.  ITAP met for the first time this week to discuss a wide range of applications of blockchain, among other FinTech trends, at an event attended by Deputy Prime Minister and chairman of the monetary authority, Tharman Shanmugaratnam.  In statements, MAS managing director Ravi Menon described the meeting as ""fruitful"" and framed it as the latest development in the city-state's emerging position as a global leader in financial technology innovation.  Menon said:  ""This in-depth discussion with global leaders in innovation marks another step in the ongoing journey by the MAS and the financial industry in Singapore to create a smart financial centre – one that harnesses technology to increase efficiency, manage risk, create new opportunities and improve the welfare of Singaporeans.""  Also represented in ITAP are chief innovation and science officers from global financial institutions, FinTech business leaders and venture capitalists.  Singapore push  As part of Singapore's efforts to develop into a global financial center, the nation’s Monetary Authority has set aside $225m as part of a five-year investment plan in financial technology.  Initially, part of those resources were used to fund a blockchain recordkeeping project, but since then, a wide range of efforts have unfolded.  Notably, in June, IBM opened an incubator at Singapore’s Marina Bay that is expected to eventually employ 5,000 computer scientists specializing in blockchain and other fields.  Though the Watson Centre opened with plans to rapidly build blockchain prototypes using IBM’s artificial intelligence tools, it was only a short time later than the company launched another blockchain project within the Singapore facility.  By mid-July, IBM had announced a collaboration with MAS and the Singapore Economic Development Board as part of a project within the centre that will focus on using blockchain tech to increase the efficiency of multi-party trade finance.  Members of ITAP engaged with industry professionals, academics, and students in four-panel discussions at the meeting on Tuesday that is said to have explored the potential impact of blockchains on domestic commerce.  The next ITAP meeting is scheduled for 2017.

42426998,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyOHh,1470408370,Mission Untraceable: How Zcash is Being Used to Obscure Ethereum Transactions,"Cryptographer Andrew Miller posed for a Snapchat selfie with one of his fans at an event earlier this week where he presented a paper on how to make ethereum smart contracts untraceable.  It was the third time during my attempt to interview him that he was approached by people who wanted to speak about his latest project, Hawk, which uses untraceable digital currency startup Zcash's underlying protocol to mask the sending and receiving addresses of ethereum transactions.  Speaking to a group of about 150 people at Microsoft's New York City headquarters, Miller delivered a detailed breakdown of his newly published white paper on the concept, a system of smart contracts that can be layered on top of any existing blockchain to hide not only a transaction's counterparty, but the amount of the transaction itself.  Miller argues that such a system could extend the usefulness of contracts running on a public blockchain where the code of the contract, data sent to the contract and money sent and received by the contract can be viewed by anyone. These factors, he posits, limit the technology's utility, enabling other parties to gain insight into a stock trader's activities and orders, should smart contracts be applied to such a use case.  An associate director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3) and an advisor to digital currency startup Zcash, Miller told CoinDesk after the lecture:  ""The goal of Hawk is to provide the programmability and expressiveness of ethereum while also providing the privacy-preserving nature of Zcash.""  The Hawk smart contract system begins with a simplified version of the open-source zerocash protocol, and it layers its smart contract system on top of that base.  In Hawk, a wide range of encrypted data — or digital currency — can then be used as the inputs and outputs of the smart contracts, ""so the blockchain can't see what the output values of the contract are,"" said Miller.  The contracts wouldn’t be implemented on every transaction, but rather used on a case-by-case basis when additional privacy is needed by users of a public blockchain.  Last week, Miller joined Casey Detrio of the Ethereum Foundation and other members of Zcash and Cornell University to build zero-knowledge proofs, known as zk-SNARKS, into a fork of ethereum's Parity client.  Zk-SNARKS have been heralded as an innovation in cryptographic privacy that could help move forward key ideas in the digital currency space, as they allow for a prover and verifier to share a common reference without exchanging data.  The event was hosted by the Foundation and Cornell.  Though Miller is currently focused on building zk-SNARKS into ethereum, he says they can technically be implemented on other blockchains and ledger systems. He listed Rootstock and Eris as examples of smart contract systems that might benefit from the privacy-enhancing implementation.  In fact, increasing privacy across blockchains is one of the goals for the project.  In interview, Miller reiterated the case for inclusivity made by his colleague at Zcash, engineer Sean Bowe, in a post last week about their work.  Miller said:  ""The ethos of Zcash is to be very inclusive and welcoming. What we care about is building privacy enhancing technology, full stop. Whether that's done through a sidechain, through an altcoin, whatever.""  For more details on the project, you can view the complete slideshow of his talk here.
