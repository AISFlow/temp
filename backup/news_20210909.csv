42411898,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgwPz,1631229656,What Is a Bitcoin Futures ETF?,"A bitcoin futures ETF is an exchange-traded fund that allows people to gain investment exposure to bitcoin prices without having to go out and buy the cryptocurrency directly. Exchange-traded funds are regulated financial products that can represent a wide range of different assets.  Investors can purchase and sell shares of the ETF just like they would stocks. But unlike mutual funds, ETF shares can be bought and sold at any time during market trading hours.  With a bitcoin futures ETF, investors are offered an alternative method of profiting off the future price movements of bitcoin. Instead of tracking a range of assets, each share of a bitcoin futures ETF is underpinned by bitcoin futures contracts.  What are bitcoin futures?  Bitcoin futures are a type of derivative trading instrument where two parties enter into a contractual agreement to buy or sell bitcoin at a predefined price at a later date, typically traded on a commodities exchange. A derivative is a term for any trading contract that tracks the price of an underlying asset.  In essence, you agree to buy or sell bitcoin at a particular price on a specific date no matter what the price ends up being. The agreed date when both parties must fulfill their obligations is known as the contract settlement date or expiration date.  Read more: CME Ethereum Futures, Explained  When a bitcoin futures contract expires, whichever party agreed to purchase bitcoin would have to buy it at either a premium or a discount (as it’s highly unlikely bitcoin will be exactly the same price upon expiry as it was when the contract was agreed). How much that person has to pay depends on the market price (also known as the spot price) at the time and the value of each of the futures contracts they have in their possession.  Below are some of the important details you need to know about bitcoin futures:  Note that there are two sides to each contract. If one person is making a profit, there is an investor on the other side incurring a loss.  Futures contracts always have an expiry date. Investors may choose to sell their contracts to another party before they expire or wait until the expiration date to settle the contracts.  The prices of bitcoin futures and the market price of bitcoin tend to diverge based on the prevailing settlement of futures traders. If more people are betting on the price of bitcoin to rise, the value of the contract would naturally be higher than the market price of bitcoin. The reverse is the case when more traders are projecting that the price of bitcoin will fall in the future. In most cases, the prices of bitcoin futures contracts and bitcoin on spot exchanges converge as the expiration date of contracts nears.  What is a bitcoin futures ETF?  An ETF tracks the price movement of an underlying asset. It provides a way to profit off the price trend of an asset without having to physically own it. In the case of a bitcoin ETF, the underlying asset tracked by the investment instrument is bitcoin. The price of an ETF will typically maintain a high correlation with the price movement of the underlying asset because investors theoretically would be able to arbitrage away the spread between the ETF and the underlying asset should it get too wide.  The same applies to a bitcoin ETF – a popular approach is to anchor the price of the bitcoin ETF to a stash of bitcoin. All the company needs to do is consistently ensure that it has enough bitcoin in its possession to back the value of its bitcoin ETF.  While this approach is widely considered one of the most effective systems for creating a bitcoin ETF, it seems that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not been too receptive to the idea of a physically backed bitcoin ETF. However, the chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, hinted that he might consider approving a bitcoin futures ETF, particularly one tracking bitcoin futures on Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).  What, then, is a bitcoin futures ETF? Well, exactly like a bitcoin ETF but one that mimics the price of bitcoin futures instead of the market price of bitcoin.  In essence, the value of the ETF is derived from the price movements of bitcoin futures. Here, the company issuing the ETF must hold positions in the bitcoin futures market and anchor the price of the ETF to those bitcoin futures contracts.  What’s the difference between the two?  Below are some of the unique traits of a bitcoin ETF and a bitcoin futures ETF.  As explained earlier, the bitcoin ETF is backed by real bitcoin, while bitcoin futures ETFs are backed by derivatives of bitcoin (futures contracts).  The price of bitcoin futures may diverge from the spot price of bitcoin due to the prevailing market sentiment so bitcoin futures ETFs might also occasionally track the price of bitcoin inaccurately. In the case of a bitcoin ETF, there is no risk of price divergence, thanks to the fact that the ETF is backed by real bitcoin.  What are the downsides of a bitcoin futures ETF?  The most notable issue associated with bitcoin futures ETFs centers around the accuracy of their price trackers. When the futures price of bitcoin is higher than its spot price, we can say the ETF is inaccurately tracking the price of bitcoin. This situation is known as “contango,” and it is detrimental to investors holding bitcoin futures ETFs. The opposite of this is known as “backwardation” and occurs when the futures price is lower than bitcoin’s spot price.  At the expiration of the bitcoin futures contracts, the company issuing the bitcoin futures ETF must roll the contracts over (that is, the process of renewing contracts by selling the almost expired ones and using the revenue to purchase new contracts with a farther expiration date). In a scenario where the prices of the bitcoin futures contract are lower than the price of the new contract, the proceeds generated for selling the contracts nearing expiration will not be enough to purchase the same number of contracts that would expire at a later date. This situation will adversely affect the performance of the ETF.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-bitcoin-futures-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df0abe1b493675714587a2797deeeb3b88622a4e-1885x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424594,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2utLh,1631219639,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Returns Above $46K; ‘Bored Apes’ Fetch $24M,"Bitcoin’s price is back above $46,000 on Thursday but the cryptocurrency is down about 4% over the past week, with some technical indicators suggesting bitcoin is oversold.  Some analysts view that selling as a temporary retracement and expect buyers to step in. “Leverage longs are flushed with funding rates reset and expect bitcoin to continue trading in an upward channel,” crypto investment firm StackFunds wrote in a report published on Wednesday.  “Bitcoin had seven consecutive weeks of positive upward momentum, which led to an overheated backdrop,” Ulrik Lykke, executive director of crypto hedge fund ARK36, said during an interview with CoinDesk.  “We managed to scale a little off some positions, but I expect upward momentum to keep going,” Lykke said. The fund is concentrated in bitcoin and ether and recently increased positions during the latest sell-off.  “The biggest upside potential is in the application domain of digital assets,” Lykke said, referring to the fund’s third-largest holding in the Polkadot blockchain’s DOT token, which rallied about 50% over the past month, compared to a 3% rise in bitcoin during the same period.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $46,598, +0.6%  Ether (ETH): $3,470, -1.3%  S&P 500: -0.5%  Gold: $1,792, +0.2%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.297%  On Thursday, the European Central Bank said it will slow the average pace of asset purchases but will keep the overall size of its quantitative easing program intact.  Cryptocurrencies and risky traditional assets like stocks have been major beneficiaries of the liquidity-boosting programs launched by global central banks, wrote CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.  Elsewhere, the market for non-fungible tokens (NFT) is heating up. A collection of 101 Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs sold for $24.4 million at a Sotheby’s auction Thursday.  Volatility returns  “Realized volatility is now on the rise and it’s very possible the market goes through a period of ranged price action,” crypto research firm Delphi Digital tweeted on Thursday. The chart below shows the increase in 10-day and one-month realized volatility for BTC and ETH during the crypto sell-off earlier this week.  Implied volatility, however, is still low compared to the sell-off in May, although some analysts don’t expect choppy trading conditions to persist this month.  “We are structurally short vega in both ETH and BTC,” crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram chat.  Short vega is an options strategy that becomes profitable when the implied volatility of the underlying asset decreases. The trader is essentially short further out of the money options and long front-month options.  QCP said it recently added to short vega positions and expressed uncertainty regarding short-term price direction.  Bitcoin supply slips from profit zone  During Tuesday’s sell-off, over 10% of bitcoin supply transitioned from holding an unrealized profit to now holding an unrealized loss, according to data from Glassnode.  This indicates an on-chain cost basis between $45,800 and $52,600 BTC, which is where the price is currently consolidating after the sell-off.  Bored Ape NFT collection fetches $24M at Sotheby’s auction  A collection of 101 Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) non-fungible tokens sold for $24.4 million at a Sotheby’s auction Thursday. The sale figure implies an average price of $241,515 per ape NFT and exceeded Sotheby’s initial estimate for the total collection of $12 million to $18 million.  BAYC NFTs are currently selling at a floor of 40 ETH on NFT marketplace OpenSea, or approximately $140,000. The sale did not appear to substantially impact the price of BAYC NFTs, which hovered around that level throughout the duration of the auction, which ran from Sept. 2 to Sept. 9.  The NFT space topped $5 billion in sales volume in August, completing its best month ever, according to a report by decentralized application (dapp) store and data provider DappRadar.  However, there are signs the NFT boom may be slowing in September. WuBlockchain tweeted, “OpenSea’s daily trading volume is showing a downward trend. The single-day trading volume on September 8 was below 100 million for the first time since August 21. Compared with the peak trading volume on August 29, it has dropped by about 3/4.”  Altcoin roundup  Solana-based game DeFi Land raises $4.1 million to teach users basics of decentralized finance: DeFi Land, which aims to gamify concepts in decentralized finance (DeFi), is set to launch later this year with a test version available to investors next week, reported CoinDesk’s Helene Braun. Over 40 investors participated in the funding round, including Animoca Brands, Alameda Research, Jump Capital and NGC Ventures. The round also included investments from the Solana Foundation, Gate.io and others.  FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried called Solana’s rally “decently organic”: Solana’s recent surge has seen its price increase by over 400% in the last 30 days, eclipsing XRP as the world’s sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Bankman-Fried said the coin’s growth despite little marketing could mean the crypto’s current price run is built on a sturdier foundation. He said it gave him comfort that the price of Solana was less likely to be the product of a “giant marketing push” or “multi-level marketing scheme-driven bulls**t.” “It is much more likely to be decently organic and that’s always been Solana’s calling card,” he said in webinar on Thursday.  Fintech company Rivetz sued by SEC over 2017 ICO: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing Rivetz, a now-defunct crypto payments startup, over its $18 million initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, which the SEC says was an unregistered securities offering. The SEC says Rivetz’s CEO used some of the money to award himself a bonus and buy a house in the Cayman Islands, reported CoinDesk’s Cheyenne Ligon. The SEC alleged Thursday that between June and September of 2017, Rivetz and its CEO, 58-year-old Steven K. Sprague, marketed and sold RvT tokens to over 7,200 investors around the world, including the United States.

42424611,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2utHh,1631219350,NFT Trading Volume Plummets but Analysts Say NFT Craze Is Far From Over,"Daily trading volume on OpenSea, the largest non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, has fallen dramatically from the $323 million peak in August to about $52 million Thursday, according to Dune Analytics.  The staggering drop could affirm thinking in some corners that the NFT market is a bubble that has popped. But several market observers say the market remains vibrant and far from finished.  “This doesn’t mean the NFT season is just over yet,” Ong Joo Kian, research analyst at Delphi Digital, wrote in a market commentary to clients. “There’s still a lot of attention on the space.”  Ong said that a few hyped projects such as Mutant Apes Yacht Club caused “a massive uptick” in NFT trading volume at the end of August and that a subsequent slowdown was not unexpected.  Others say the NFT market has merely hit a temporary plateau, as it looks for the next big project to generate more cash and new users.  “It’s possible we’re experiencing a top in certain NFT categories like PFP [profile pics] or avatar NFTs,” Messari Senior Research Analyst Mason Nystrom said. “But it only takes one new and exciting project to help the market reach a new top.”  But observers do not know what new NFT themes will spur a market resurgence. A number of recent projects have covered roughly the same ground.  “The number of projects with similar ideas – such as those Loot copycats – has increased, but we are not seeing more new participants coming into the NFT sector,” Martha Zhang, founder of NFT platform StarryNift, told CoinDesk.  The top NFTs by trading volume were Loot, CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club, according to OpenSea, which is a secondary marketplace for bidding on and trading NFTs. The daily trading volume for CryptoPunks declined by more than 90%. The floor price for CryptoPunks, according to NFT Price Floor, is currently at around 90 ether, down from an August peak of 132 ether. Floor price refers to the lowest price of any NFT within a certain category (in this case, the CryptoPunk collection).  OpenSea logged record-high trading volume a month ago amid the launch of Pudgy Penguins and a slew of other popular NFT projects. The hype around these projects dramatically increased activity on OpenSea.  Sales volumes of CryptoPunks, one of the most popular NFT projects, broke NFT daily sales records on Aug. 23, not long after credit-card giant Visa entered the market and purchased one.  Delphi’s Ong said that as the Ethereum blockchain has become congested, some NFT activities have spilled over to other layer 1 blockchains such as Solana. That trend could consequently slow NFT growth on the Ethereum blockchain. OpenSea continues to rank first with over 1,560 ether ($5,467,148) for gas consumption to pay transaction fees on Ethereum over the past 24 hours, according to Dune Analytics.  Many layer 1 blockchain projects such as Solana provide faster, lower-cost transactions compared to Ethereum, which can be attractive for the NFT market. Crypto exchange FTX’s U.S. version recently announced the launch of a minting platform for NFTs that’s built on both Ethereum and Solana.  “The NFT market will certainly continue to grow, [and] it’s just a matter of how fast and how volatile the growth will be,” Messari’s Nystrom said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/09/nft-trading-volume-plummets-but-analysts-say-nft-craze-is-far-from-over,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/167657f7e95cedd206c038cb9ec5609458f5e5dc-1198x552.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After falling 15.38 percent to $27.22 just yesterday, LUNA bounced straight back as soon as price fell below the key support level at $25. The token is up around 14 percent since then to rise back just above the $30 mark as it looks to consolidate there. The buyer push was initiated once support was breached and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell below 20 to indicate an extremely undervalued status. However, the current trend could prove to be temporary resistance against the fall as price continues to dwindle between a wide range of $25 to $38 over the past week. Hence, consolidation above support levels near the current price remains crucial. Price action for LUNA followed a largely positive 24 hours for Altcoins in the larger cryptocurrency market. Ethereum went back past the $3,500 mark by moving up 3 percent, whereas Ripple, Cardano and Dogecoin showed increments of around 1 percent each.

Bitcoin Spot Exchange Reserve Continues To Decline Despite The Huge Dip As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, the BTC reserve on spot exchanges has actually declined amidst the current price dip. The Bitcoin all exchanges reserve is an indicator that shows the amount of coins present in wallets of all the centralized spot exchanges. When the reserve&apos;s value moves up, it means more investors are sending their BTC to exchanges for withdrawing to fiat or altcoin purchasing. Similarly, a downtrend in the metric implies investors are withdrawing a net amount of Bitcoin from exchange wallets to personal ones for hodling them, or selling through OTC deals. Here is a chart showing how the value of the indicator has changed in the past year: The Bitcoin exchange reserve seems to be going down | Source: CryptoQuant Now, on examining the above graph, some interesting features can be seen. In the lead-up to the 2021 bull run, the exchange reserve was coming down from a very high value. This makes sense as a downtrend like that one means investors were accumulating more coins, which can help drive the price up. Then, around when Bitcoin hit its all-time-high (ATH), the metric started climbing back up quick, indicating a selloff, and thus the price crashed in response.

42424574,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2usjh,1631211943,Giancarlo on Coinbase-SEC Clash: ‘Don’t Apply 90-Year-Old Statutes’,"Coinbase’s tussle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) highlights the need for clearer rules for digital assets, according to former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Chris Giancarlo.  In an appearance on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” Thursday, the regulatory veteran, nicknamed “Crypto Dad” for his favorable views of the technology, described the current rules as anachronistic and unevenly enforced.  “The chairs [of regulatory agencies] have a fair amount of discretion in terms of applying rule sets,” Giancarlo said. “It’s important for this new innovation that we don’t apply 90-year-old statutes, which is effectively what we have.”  His comments come in the wake of Coinbase’s revelation that the SEC threatened to sue the cryptocurrency exchange should it introduce a proposed savings account-like product. Coinbase said it disagreed with the agency’s contention that the product would meet the definition of a security. Uniswap Labs, the development group behind a decentralized competitor to Coinbase, also is reportedly under investigation by the SEC.  “Ultimately, it will be the courts that will have to determine jurisdiction and apply the security laws to these asset classes, and I’m optimistic that Congress steps in,” Giancarlo said in response to a question about Coinbase’s situation. “Congress in the last few months has really recognized crypto [...] and has woken up to this technology and its power and potential.”  Coinbase also claimed that it had approached the SEC for feedback on the proposed product and never got any feedback until the agency opened an investigation.  Perhaps in reference to this, Giancarlo said Thursday that “dialogue is critically important.”  BlockFi and digital dollar  Addressing his recent departure from the board of embattled crypto lender BlockFi, Giancarlo explained that he simply had too many projects going on and needed a “portfolio rebalancing.”  He noted that he remains an adviser to BlockFi and said he will help the firm navigate the scrutiny it’s receiving from regulators.  Giancarlo has been one of the key directors for an Accenture-backed project advocating for a digital dollar and publishing white papers exploring the different design considerations since last year.  On Thursday, he reiterated that the United States needs to be thinking about a digital dollar, not just as a payment system but as a way of “ringing out costs from the U.S. economy.” It should be looking to stablecoin developers and learn from their years of experience, he added.  “Right now, the United States is leading from behind and there’s unfortunate ramifications that we continue on that course of being not a leader but a lagger in that development of digital money,” Giancarlo said.  Broadly, Giancarlo framed cryptocurrency as a salutary force in financial services.  “This innovation presents the opportunity to solve some of the worst elements of our existing structure […] its slowness, its expensiveness and, most unfortunate, its exclusiveness,” he said. “We need to see it as revolutionary and be willing to be flexible with our existing models and look to this innovation to modernize shortcomings.”",POSITIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | UNI,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/09/giancarlo-on-coinbase-sec-clash-dont-apply-90-year-old-statutes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/988494b47df70416ae858bac0dd1c36189927558-1500x1051.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a blog post Thursday, SZNS (pronounced “seasons”) announced a $4 million funding round led by Framework Ventures and Dragonfly Capital, with contributions from Pear.vc and Baller ventures, among others.  SZNS allows users to create “albums,” or collections of NFTs, that can be fractionalized as governance tokens and managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). (Roughly speaking, DAOs are internet communities with a shared checkbook.)  There are a swath of fractionalization services currently on the market, including NFTX and Fractional, but according to SZNS founder John Bisu, the new platform is aiming to expand functionality.  “There’s a limitation on what users can do with their fractionalized tokens,” Bisu said in an interview with CoinDesk. “It’s very buyout-based, where the only option for them is to buy out the NFT.”  He said that giving users access to the upside of non-fungible assets is a “very noble” thing; SZNS is aiming for a more fluid vault model that allows for easy entry and exit of assets based on governance decisions.  Read more: Why Everyone in NFTs Is Suddenly Talking About Price ‘Floors’  In July, PleasrDAO used four NFTs to obtain a $3.5 million loan from decentralized finance (DeFi) platform CREAM Finance’s Iron Bank; as the platform develops, SZNS albums could also be used to collateralize NFTs and vote to use funds in the DeFi ecosystem.  Album governance tokens will function as a fungible proxy for the NFTs in the album vaults, and will be listed on decentralized exchanges such as SushiSwap. Sushi core contributor 0xMaki is an adviser to the project.  The platform is aiming to launch in early October with a series of preset albums focusing on certain NFT projects, including CryptoPunks and Meebits.

The Palo Alto, Calif.-based team said Thursday the initiative, part of what it is calling a “full-stack ecosystem strategy,” aims to support 10,000 startups with bounties, grants and other sweeteners. It comes as competing base layers like Avalanche, Fantom and others pony up large funds to reward projects in an increasingly competitive space.  “We think that Harmony has the right vision for creating wealth together, for having the infrastructure and platform to do it,” Harmony founder Stephen Tse told CoinDesk.  The company will allocate $180 million over the next year with $50 million going to 100 decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that can then decide how to use the capital, including supporting smaller projects. There’s an additional $30 million going to partner organizations that have deployed on Harmony and can reach end-users.  The foundation will distribute most of the remaining funds, which it has built up in a reserve fund from investors and current network participants through different-sized grants, rewards and investments. Small groups of network participants will vote on individual projects.  “When we started this project, we allocated a token that network validators and investors would get a certain reward, but there are huge reserves,” Tse said.  Harmony is a proof-of-stake blockchain that claims to process transactions in two seconds at a low cost. It raised $18 million in an April 2019 token sale to strategic investors and the following month, sold an additional $5 million worth of tokens via an initial exchange offering on the Binance Launchpad.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/09/harmony-has-300m-for-projects-looking-to-expand-beyond-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b53f429408db36f2bbafeb982df38b09a190d36-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421741,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpJvB,1631208878,Are Central Bankers Ready for Payments Theater?,"It’s 2026, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has just sat down in front of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. Powell has spent the last few days preparing to be grilled by lawmakers about why the Fed recently raised interest rates.  But the questioning quickly takes a different tack.  “Why is FedSend being used by dangerous white supremacists for funding?” asks Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. She’s referring to the Fed’s central bank digital currency, FedSend, unveiled in 2024. “What sorts of controls do you have in place to prevent this?”  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.  The next question comes from Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho., who wants to know why FedSend is being used as a payment method on porn websites hosting BDSM and underage porn.  Another senator asks: “FedSend has become the most popular means of payment for fraudsters running tech support and IRS scams. How do you plan to protect seniors?”  Powell sighs. It’s going to be a long day.  Central bankers seem keener than ever to try their hand at issuing a retail central bank digital currency, or CBDC. Retail CBDC is a digital version of central bank money, one that everyone can use.  Retail CBDC mostly exists as a concept in central bank research papers and speeches, as well as the odd pilot program. Much of the CDBC research enterprise has centered on esoteric technical details such as: Should CBDC pay interest or not? How should it be distributed? Should it be hosted on a blockchain or a regular database?  But something has been missing from the discussion. After a CBDC has been built, it will have to be governed. The central bank will have to write out its terms of service, or TOS – a payments constitution that describes who can use it and how.  This TOS will become ground zero for all sorts of political disputes. Are central bankers like Jerome Powell ready to enter the messy politics of governing a retail payments system? They may discover that controversies over CBDC permissible use and accessibility end up hogging a much larger chunk of their time than they bargained for.  OnlyFans’s recent ban of explicit porn (which was rescinded after a few days) illustrates how divisive payments governance can be. We still don’t know why OnlyFans decided to hack off one of its own legs, but it may have had something to do with the rules of the underlying payments systems on which the site relies. The media fallout was a huge PR disaster for all involved, including Mastercard. If FedSend was part of the picture, it, too, would have been dragged into the controversy.  Say that a central bank like the Fed builds a CBDC. It decides to go with a very simple TOS, something like: “FedSend cannot be used for illegal activities,” and that’s it. Even this bare-bones payments constitution will open the Fed to attack. Fed officials will now have to arbitrate the line between legal and illegal, and that’s much trickier than it sounds.  For instance, a major porn clip site quickly adopts FedSend for payments. Not long after, critics demonstrate that this clip site is selling illegal content like porn involving children along with the legal stuff.  Confronted with a clear violation of its TOS, the Fed will now be forced to police its network.  Before disciplining the clip site, Fed officials will have to investigate whether it acted knowingly in hosting the material. Henceforth, they may have to devise rules that all clip sites must follow to stop illegal content. A Fed porn expert will be appointed to regularly check up on clip sites for compliance. But that sort of surveillance will be expensive.  The Fed may be tempted to summarily cut off all porn clip sites from using FedSend, even non-offending clip sites. But that also opens it up to charges of censorship – and lawsuits.  As you can see, retail payments governance quickly gets complicated, controversial and expensive.  Satoshi Nakamoto famously described another governance puzzle that central bankers will run into: Financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes.  People often make mistaken payments. We send money to scammers. Our accounts may be emptied after being taken over by fraudsters. Or maybe we buy a defective product and want our money back, but the merchant isn’t responding to our emails.  Read More: OnlyFans Shows How the Banking System Is Politicized | Nic Carter  The pressure to protect retail customers from these dangers means that central banks will probably have to devise ways to arbitrate disputed CBDC payments and subsequently reverse, or undo, them. But it won’t be cheap to arbitrate payments disputes. Central banks will have to set up tribunals, hire and train personnel, and so forth.  Complicating matters is that certain types of products (like virtual goods) are more prone to fraud and payments reversals than others (like restaurants), and disputed payments involving these high-risk goods will demand a disproportionate share of the Fed tribunal’s time. The Fed may decide to charge higher fees to higher-risk industries. Or the Fed may ask all industries to bear the same costs. Either way it’ll attract constant political flack for unfairness.  And maybe that’s fine. Maybe central bankers really do think that it’s important to get involved in all the thorny issues surrounding retail payments governance. Maybe they want to vet website content and arbitrate disputes. They may like the challenges of getting caught up in woke social media wars over platforming and deplatforming. Perhaps they think they can do a better job of writing a TOS than Visa and Mastercard.  But central banks already have responsibility for setting monetary policy, which is an incredibly important task. Many of them have financial regulation duties, too. Hopefully the demands of payments system governance don’t overwhelm them.  Outsourced governance?  Let’s zoom forward again to 2026. “There’s got to be a way around this,” thinks Jerome Powell as various Democrat and Republican senators tear into him about FedSend. “Can we at the Fed provide Americans with a CBDC without any of the controversy?”  One possibility is to offload some of the responsibility for running FedSend onto the private sector. That is, the Fed does the nuts and bolts of issuing and redeeming CBDC but commercial partners – Bank of America, Chase, PayPal – take care of all of the customer-facing duties. They onboard FedSend customers, check for money launderers, arbitrate disputes and deplatform anyone who is caught doing something illegal.  By taking on governance, the private sector thus absorbs the political risk.  This will be expensive, though, and the banks and fintechs will have to be compensated. That means giving them a bigger say in how FedSend user fees are set.  Read More: OnlyFans’ Porn U-Turn Is a Victory Against Banking Censorship | David Z. Morris  But even under this tiered model, Powell still won’t be safe from the controversies that flow from CBDC governance. As long as the Fed’s CBDC is offered through banks and fintechs but branded as a Fed product, FedSend, the politics will always lead back to the brand owner, the Fed. If it wants to be fully firewalled from payments theater, the Fed has to give up on CBDC branding.  But at this point FedSend would be like all of the other Fed products that are offered wholly through banking intermediaries, like FedACH or FedWire. The banks repackage them, or white label them, as they see fit and set the price.  At which point the Fed has become just another dumb pipe, one with no control over the final product. It’s not really a CBDC anymore. It’s just another bank product. What’s the point?  I’d suggest that there’s a trade-off between the effectiveness of a CBDC and the amount of sweat and tears a central bank is willing to put into ongoing governance. Going full CBDC means taking on a huge amount of work. Central bankers may choose to limit their involvement in governance (and the associated sweat and tears) but that means the product will not be as transformative as it would otherwise be.  To date, central banks have tackled retail CBDC as a technological problem. But I worry they are underestimating the challenges posed by governance. Hopefully, they get up to speed. The last thing they want is to build a fancy CBDC and then regret it because of all the political hassle it brings them.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/09/are-central-bankers-ready-for-payments-theater,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff78a99718d0320d3352412858c97de39cba4b27-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since earlier this year, Ukrainian legislators have been working together on a package of laws that would write crypto into the country’s legal system, open the banks for crypto startups and offer a simple procedure for tax reporting.

The SEC alleged Thursday that between June and September of 2017, Rivetz and its CEO, 58-year-old Steven K. Sprague, marketed and sold RvT tokens to over 7,200 investors around the world, including the United States.  While the SEC says that Sprague and Rivetz “used the funds raised primarily to capitalize” Rivetz’s business, the sale of RvT tokens was not registered with the agency.  According to the complaint, Sprague used a portion of the proceeds, collected in ether and sold for U.S. dollars, to award himself a one-time bonus of $1 million.  He also allegedly borrowed $2.5 million from the funds to “purchase a house in the Cayman Islands that he then leased back to Rivetz Int’l,” a wholly-owned international subsidiary of Rivetz.

42394455,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdZed,1631204834,The Burning Question Behind NFTs,"The other day I was walking through a flood-wrecked neighborhood when I found an interesting work of art on the ground. It was an original, signed and numbered (35/100) print of Theodoros Stamos’ famed Paris Review cover sold at the New York World’s Fair. Kept in near-mint condition since 1965 – probably unthinkingly cast aside with a number of household artifacts touched by the mighty Bronx River during Hurricane Ida’s storm surge – I was surprised to learn it was only worth a couple of hundred dollars. One man’s trash is another’s treasure, but this was clearly a gem.  But that’s less than the least expensive Weird Whale NFT (non-fungible token), or than a “Loot box” for a non-existent blockchain game. My first thought was to burn it, then mint the asset as an NFT to list on OpenSea. Although not a major trend yet, as more people begin to recognize NFTs as a viable (and easy to own) asset class it’s a question many may come to face.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news.  There’s precedent for burning art to create value. Last March, blockchain company Injective Protocol did just the same to a genuine Banksy. The “BurntBanksy collective” removed “the physical piece from existence” to make way for a smart contract that now stands for the memory of the original. (Banksy himself shredded a piece of his own work after it was sold at auction in 2018.)  To some extent, the BurntBanksy NFT is an entirely original work of art. It’s a conceptual piece that asks whether we should prefer physical items over digital, as Paul Dylan-Ennis put it. Plus, it literally has a new signature that lives on the blockchain.  Then there’s Damien Hirst’s “Currency,” a series that offers buyers the opportunity to own either a unique hand-painted sheet covered in colorful dots or one of 10,000 NFTs corresponding to them. In a year’s time, if a collector chooses to own the painting, the matching token will be destroyed and vice versa.  “It’s kind of this cynical choice,” Sarah Meyohas, a Yale-trained artist who broke into the blockchain space in 2015 with “Bitchcoin,” said in an interview. “He’s telling you, like, do you want the physical dollar bill or do you believe in the metaverse, because he doesn’t actually have a position on it.”  Read more: Do NFTs’ Crazy Valuations Make Them Art? A Leading Collector Says No  Sometimes the choice is destroying an original digital work to make an NFT. A few months ago, the creator of the popular meme “Charlie bit my finger – again!” removed the video from YouTube (where it lived since 2007 and earned more 883 million views) after it was tokenized and auctioned off.  More often than not, the choice to destroy an object in order to monetize it is simply performative, a way of telling the world you were the first to have the idea or apply it to a new context. It can signal to the world that this is something worth paying attention to, but it rarely creates value – especially as time goes on.  “This is basically like a short-term Band-Aid to deal with the complications of having an asset exist both physically and digitally,” Meyohas said.  Could the same be true of my Stamos print? Part of the post-war Abstract Expressionist movement in the U.S., Stamos’ entire body of work was one big question mark. What is art? For him, painting could be reduced to pure colors on canvas. Purposely destroying his work fits the theme, a way to bring his work into a modern context.  But in the end, the gas price is just too damn high.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING | INJ,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/09/the-burning-question-behind-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b3f22a4cc4e6d62236fc59ccd0d2a0dfefb01d3-2400x1334.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking in a webinar about Solana sponsored by FTX on Thursday, Bankman-Fried explained how one of Solana’s weaknesses may prove to be a strength amid the token’s current rally.  The technology of Solana “outstripped its marketing by a good solid year-and-a-half or so,” according to the FTX CEO.  Bankman-Fried said he regards this “mostly” as a downside, but it could mean the crypto’s current price run is built on a sturdier foundation as a result.  He said it gave him comfort that the price of Solana was less likely to be the product of a “giant marketing push” or “multi-level marketing scheme-driven bulls**t.”  “It is much more likely to be decently organic and that’s always been Solana’s calling card,” he added.  Solana’s recent surge has seen its price increase by over 400% in the last 30 days, eclipsing XRP as the world’s sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization  FTX this week launched a minting platform for non-fungible tokens (NFT) that will be built cross-chain on Solana and Ethereum.

The company announced Thursday that it hired Brian Shroder as president of the exchange and also made him a board member. Shroder was formerly a strategist and business development executive at Ant Group, an affiliate company of Chinese internet giant Alibaba.  The former Uber executive will oversee fundraising, business and corporate development, as well as manage the company’s human resources and legal matters, said Binance.US.  The positive spin for Binance.US is that this hire will carry on bolstering the firm’s recently announced intention to go public, which Shroder alluded to in a statement: “I look forward to sharing our exciting story with the broader investment community as we begin our journey towards IPO,” he said.  However, the harsh reality is that Binance.US’s star regulatory hire, Brooks, a former chief of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), departed the exchange after just four months, amid a global regulatory assault on parent company Binance.com.  Asia connection  Shroder’s brother Matt Shroder, also works for Binance, as a vice president heading up the global markets team for Binance out of Singapore.  According to Josh Goodbody, chief operating officer of crypto custody firm Qredo, Shroder’s appointment is a shrewd move by Binance.US to bring in an executive with experience in doing business in Asia. Another objective will be facing off stiff competition in the U.S. market, with firms like FTX aggressively winning market share, he said. Goodbody was formerly director of growth for Binance’s European and Latin American markets.  “Despite being an independent company, Binance.US’ success is inextricably linked to its relationships with the Binance Group, an organization with its leadership and deep roots in Asia,” Goodbody told CoinDesk via Telegram, adding:  “Knowing how to navigate this business culture, whilst building an increasingly regulated business in the U.S., is a key skill Shroder will need to exercise.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/09/binanceus-hires-ant-group-exec-to-succeed-ex-ceo-brian-brooks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/96975834bae9f1c263468720e1343876823c1a38-5000x3335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The sale did not appear to substantially impact the price of BAYC NFTs, which hovered around that level throughout the duration of the auction, which ran from Sept. 2 to Sept. 9.  The online sale at Sotheby’s saw over 40 bids placed from bidders from eight different countries, including a majority who were new to the auction house.  The sale drew largely positive support from the BAYC and broader NFT community on Twitter.  “Congratulations and THANK YOU to the whole ape community,” tweeted the BAYC in response to the historic sale. “To the buyer, I think we speak for everybody when we say: WELCOME TO THE CLUB.”  The million-dollar sale prices of NFTs such as BAYC and CryptoPunks have captured the attention of international auction houses itching to cash in on the boom.  “We actually have a number of other NFT auctions already in the works and have been developing a long-term NFT strategy since this spring,” said Bouhanna.  The auction house has also seen interest from traditional art collectors who are “eager to learn” about the new art category, he added.  The NFT space topped $5 billion in sales volume in August, completing its best month ever, according to a report by decentralized application (dapp) store and data provider DappRadar.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/09/sothebys-auction-of-101-bored-ape-nfts-fetches-24m-smashing-estimates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe075b58e5f626b6fecf1aabf4202a478907cc99-1858x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411925,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh5XO,1631198091,How to Set Up a Bitcoin Miner,"If you're asking how you can set up bitcoin mining hardware, you likely already understand how bitcoin works and what bitcoin mining means. But we need to get from theory to practice and start generating some digital cash. The first thing you need to do is decide on what hardware you’re going to use. There are two main things to think about when choosing it:  Hashrate: This is the number of calculations your hardware can perform every second as it tries to beat the target hash. Hashrates are measured in megahashes, gigahashes, terahashes and exahashes per second (MH/sec, GH/sec, TH/sec, and EH/sec). The higher your hashrate (compared to the current average hashrate), the more likely you are to solve a transaction block. The Bitcoin wiki’s mining hardware comparison page is a good place to go for rough information on hashrates for different hardware.  Energy consumption: When choosing your hardware, it’s worth looking at the device’s energy consumption. Bitcoin mining rigs have a healthy appetite for electricity, and that costs money. You want to make sure you don’t end up spending all your money on electricity to mine coins that won’t be worth what you paid.  To work out how many hashes you’re getting for every watt of electricity that you use, divide the hash count by the number of watts shown in the technical specifications of the hardware.  Read more:Can You Still Mine Bitcoin and Other Crypto From Home?  Read more: What Does Hashrate Mean?  For example, if you have a 500 GH/sec device, and it’s taking 400 watts of power, you’re getting 1.25 GH/sec per watt. You can check your power bill or use an electricity price calculator online to find out how much that means in hard cash.  There are three main hardware categories for bitcoin miners: GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs. We’ll explore them in depth below.  CPU/GPU bitcoin mining  The least powerful category of crypto mining hardware is your computer itself. Theoretically, you could use your computer’s CPU to mine for bitcoins, but in practice, this is so slow by today’s standards that there isn’t any point.  You can enhance your bitcoin hashrate by adding graphics hardware to your desktop computer. Graphics cards feature graphical processing units (GPUs). These are designed for heavy mathematical lifting so they can calculate all the complex polygons needed in high-end video games. This makes them particularly good at the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) - or SHA-256 in Bitcoin’s case - hashing mathematics necessary to solve transaction blocks.  One of the nice things about GPUs is they also leave your options open. Unlike other options discussed later, these units can be used with cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. Litecoin, for example, uses a different proof-of-work algorithm to Bitcoin, called Scrypt. This has been optimized to be friendly to CPUs and GPUs, making them a good option for GPU miners who want to switch between different currencies. However, similar to bitcoin mining, ASICs now dominate the litecoin mining landscape.  CPU and GPU mining are no longer viable these days. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has accelerated so much with the release of ASIC mining power that simple graphics cards can’t compete.  FPGA miners  A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured after being built. This enables a crypto mining hardware manufacturer to buy the chips in volume, and then customize them for bitcoin mining before putting them into their own equipment. Because they are customized for bitcoin mining, they offer performance improvements over CPUs and GPUs. Single-chip FPGAs have been seen operating at around 750 MH/sec, although that’s at the high end, although manufacturers could put more than one chip on a board.  They were a significant upgrade over CPU and GPU mining at the time. However, today FPGAs are no longer competitive in bitcoin mining due to their low performance.  ASIC chips  This is where the action is. Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are specifically designed to do just one thing: mine bitcoin at mind-crushing speeds as efficiently as possible. Because these chips have to be designed specifically for that task and then fabricated, they are expensive and time-consuming to produce – but the speeds are stunning. At the time of writing, units are selling with speeds anywhere from 7-14 Terahash/second (1 Terahash = 1 trillion hashes.) It will be interesting to see if there is more progress to be made past the 14 TH/sec point.  Before making your purchase to start your crypto mining business, calculate the projected profitability of your miner, using mining profitability calculators online like this one. You can input parameters such as equipment cost, hashrate, power consumption and the current bitcoin price to see how long it will take to pay back your investment.  Read more: What are Bitcoin Mining Pools?  One of the other key parameters here is network difficulty. This metric determines how hard it is to discover new blocks, and varies according to the network hashrate. The difficulty is likely to increase substantially as ASIC devices come on the market, so it might be worth increasing this metric in the calculator to see what your return on investment will be like as more people join the game.  You may well need crypto mining software for your ASIC miner, too, although some newer models promise to ship with everything pre-configured, including a bitcoin address so that all you need to do is plug it in the wall.  Now, you’re all set up. Good for you. But chances are you won’t stand much chance of successfully mining bitcoin unless you work with other people, by joining a bitcoin mining pool for example. Nowadays, the bitcoin mining industry primarily operates on a pool level rather than on an individual level. Some of the biggest bitcoin mining pools in the world right now are F2Pool, Poolin, Binance Pool and AntPool.  Further reading on bitcoin  What Makes Bitcoin Price Go Up ... or Crash Down?

42411917,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh5AF,1631198068,What Are Bitcoin Mining Pools?,"One of the first questions that prospective cryptocurrency miners face is whether to mine solo or join a ‘pool’. There are a multitude of reasons both for and against mining pools. Here’s what you need to know.  If you’re deciding whether to join a bitcoin mining pool or not, it can be helpful to think of it like a lottery syndicate – the pros and cons are exactly the same. Going solo means you won’t have to share the reward, but your odds of getting a reward are significantly decreased. Although a bitcoin mining pool has a much larger chance of solving a block and winning the reward, that reward will be split between all the pool members.  Read more: Can You Still Mine Bitcoin and Other Crypto From Home?  Therefore, joining a mining pool creates a steady stream of income, even if each payment is modest compared to the full block reward (which currently stands at 6.25 BTC). It is important to note that a bitcoin mining pool should not exceed over 51% of the hashing power of the network. If a single entity ends up controlling more than 50% of a cryptocurrency network’s computing power, it could theoretically wreak havoc on the whole network.  Why join a bitcoin mining pool?  Difficulty level is another factor to keep in mind when considering solo mining. It is currently so high that it’s practically impossible for soloists to make a profit mining. Unless, of course, you happen to have a garage full of ASICs sitting in Arctic conditions. If you’re a beginner, joining a bitcoin mining pool is a great way to reap a small reward over a short period of time. Indeed, pools are a way to encourage small-scale miners to stay involved.  One method of mining that bitcoin facilitates is “merged mining”. This is where blocks solved for bitcoin can be used for other currencies that use the same proof of work algorithm (for example, namecoin and devcoin). A useful analogy for merged mining is to think of it like entering the same set of numbers into several lotteries.  First-time miners who lack particularly powerful hardware should look at altcoins over bitcoin – especially currencies based on the scrypt algorithm rather than SHA256. This is because the difficulty of bitcoin calculations is far too high for the processors found in regular PCs.  What to consider when joining a bitcoin mining pool  When deciding which mining pool to join, you need to weigh up how each pool shares out its payments and what fees (if any) it deducts. Typical deductions range from 1% to 10%. However, some pools do not deduct anything.  There are many schemes by which pools can divide payments. Most of which concentrate on the amount of ‘shares’ which a miner has submitted to the pool as ‘proof of work’.  Shares are a tricky concept to grasp. Keep two things in mind:  Mining is a process of solving cryptographic puzzles.  Mining has a difficulty level.  When a miner ‘solves a block’ there is a corresponding difficulty level for the solution. Think of it as a measure of quality. If the difficulty rating of the miner’s solution is above the difficulty level of the entire currency, it is added to that currency’s blockchain and coins are rewarded.  Additionally, a mining pool sets a difficulty level between 1 and the currency’s difficulty. If a miner returns a block which scores a difficulty level between the pool’s difficulty level and the currency’s difficulty level, the block is recorded as a ‘share’. There is no use whatsoever for these share blocks, but they are recorded as proof of work to show that miners are trying to solve blocks. They also indicate how much processing power they are contributing to the pool – the better the hardware, the more shares are generated.  The most basic version of dividing payments this way is the ‘pay per share’ (PPS) model. Variations on this puts limits on the rate paid per share; for example, equalised shared maximum pay per share (ESMPPS), or shared maximum pay per share (SMPPS). Pools may or may not prioritise payments for how recently miners have submitted shares: for example, recent shared maximum pay per share (RSMPPS). More examples can be found on the bitcoin wiki.  Mining pools beyond bitcoin  There are many pool options available for mining beside bitcoin. You can easily find lists of mining pools for your cryptocurrency of choice, whether it’s zcash, litecoin or ether. Some popular ones are:  BTC.com  Slush Pool  AntPool  How to join a mining pool  Having decided which currency to mine and which pool to work for, it’s time to get started. You need to create an account on the pool’s website, which is just like signing up for any other web service. Once you have an account, you’ll need to create a ‘worker’. You can create multiple workers for each piece of mining hardware you’ll use. The default settings on most pools are for workers to be assigned a number as their name, and ‘x’ as their password, but you can change these to whatever you like.

42421048,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBLHp,1631197673,Do NFTs’ Crazy Valuations Make Them Art? A Leading Collector Says No,"Recent auctions of non-fungible tokens (NFT) at the Christie’s and Sotheby’s auction houses might give the impression the fine art world has embraced the new crypto-art trend with open arms. But that would be a mistake. According to one of the art world’s biggest players, the auction houses aren’t leading tastemakers and NFTs still have very little foothold in the broader fine art industry.  “The early signals we see in the art world are around what galleries, collectors and curators do,” says Scott Lynn, CEO of art investing service Masterworks, which fractionalizes blue-chip (physical) art to make the investment more accessible. “So far, it’s been pretty limited [for NFTs]. The Beeple sale [for $69.3 million], the people registered for that [auction] were crypto people, not art people. The Venn Diagram is pretty separate.”  As frenzied as activity around NFTs has been in recent months, that distance from fine art might be concerning to NFT investors, creators and platforms. Blue-chip fine art has been one of the strongest investment categories of recent decades, returning an average of 14% per year since 1995. But so far there’s no solid reason to assume NFTs will benefit from the same social and market forces that keep fine art prices moving steadily upwards.  NFTs are riding a hype train right now, but the market for high-end NFTs in particular is only beginning to spread beyond crypto insiders. The number of people who can or will pay multimillion-dollar price tags for digital collectibles is finite, and at the moment fine art is a major rival for their dollars. In 2018, art was the top unconventional investment for high-net-worth individuals, edging out wine, diamonds and stamps. Gaining a foothold in the fine art industry, then, could make the market momentum of NFTs more sustainable.  “We view [NFTs] more as an extension of crypto than we do as enthusiasm for art,” says Lynn. He should know – he says he’s been an art collector since the 1990s and his collection is now one of the largest in the world. Masterworks itself, acting on behalf of its clients, is now the largest buyer in the art market, according to the company.  Fine art is indeed an industry – and a big one. Fine art sales generate about $60 billion in transaction volume a year. According to Deloitte, the total value of blue-chip fine art – the asset’s market cap, if you will – is $1.7 trillion. For scale, that’s not far short of the current $2.3 trillion total market cap of all cryptocurrencies.  Returns on fine art investments have also been huge. Blue-chip art – paintings by big, recognizable, often dead names like Van Gogh – beat the S&P 500 by 180% from 2000-2018, according to Artprice. Those might be modest annual returns by NFT standards, but as any half-decent investor will tell you, it’s the long run that usually counts. Without that kind of track record, NFTs are still highly speculative from a finance and investing perspective.  NFT valuations would be reinforced by better integration with the complex taste-making apparatus of the fine art world. The art industry’s big numbers are supported by a humming and many-layered web of commercial galleries, nonprofit museums, curators, critics, dealers, art handlers and hopeful interns. And just as adoption and hype in the blockchain world is largely a matter of what people are talking about on Twitter and Telegram, the value of art pieces is set in large part by the constant conversation and debate within that world.  That conversation is especially important because art, and the quality thereof, is so subjective, according to a 2018 statistical study of art valuation.  “Art appeals to individual senses, pleasures, feelings and emotions,” wrote the research team, led by Samuel Fraiberger, a former Harvard researcher now at the World Bank. “Recognition depends on variables external to the work itself, like its attribution, the artist’s body of work, the display venue and the work’s relationship to art history as a whole. Recognition and value are shaped by a network of experts, curators, collectors and art historians whose judgments act as gatekeepers for museums, galleries, and auction houses.”  The study assembled a dataset of art pieces and followed their prices over long time spans. The conclusion, broadly, was that an artist’s association with high-profile institutions, particularly galleries, had a huge impact on the long-term value of an artist’s work.  “The lasting success of an artist depends on where she gets exhibited,” says Marcus Resch, one of the study’s co-authors. “Translated to the NFT world this means that only NFT art that gets exhibited in a few selected galleries/museums will enjoy lasting value.”  Of course, that doesn’t mean the same Paris and New York galleries and museums that dominate the mainstream fine art world will become gatekeepers for NFTs – in fact, they’ve shown little interest so far. A few New York galleries have held NFT shows, but they’ve largely been upstart players like Superchief, a gallery that has a strong “cool factor” but is well outside the orbit of star-making powerhouse galleries like Gagosian, David Zwirner, Anton Kern or White Cube.  Whether or not the established art world or physical galleries are involved, the subjective nature of art and culture suggests that some similar ecosystem of culture-industry tastemakers and gatekeepers will almost inevitably come to influence what NFTs are more highly valued than others. That influence will grow slowly, just as today’s fine-art powerhouses grew. But over time, it would help NFTs lock in the kind of long-run growth that mainstream fine art has shown.  “How does what we define as cultural significance impact the investment profile of an object?” Lynn asks. “What we see is that cultural significance is important to how an object increases or decreases in value.”  Lynn thinks this is a possible future for NFTs, even if it hasn’t happened yet. He has some concerns about the intellectual property and legal dimensions of NFTs as investments, but he allows they have potential as fine art. He particularly cites NFTs that leverage the truly unique technological features of the medium, such as interactivity or automation.  Others in the fine art establishment are definitely curious about the medium. Damien Hirst is probably the most famous artist to dabble in NFTs, with his series “The Currency.” It’s notable, though, that Hirst has spent his career flirting with mockery of art’s commercialization, so the series isn’t necessarily meant as a vigorous endorsement of the technology. New York Magazine art critic Jerry Saltz also seems pro-NFT, writing recently that “someday, there may be a Francis Bacon of NFTs,” referring to one of the greatest (and most valuable) contemporary painters. Saltz is arguably the most prominent working art critic (though perhaps not the most nuanced), and even sold his own NFT for charity.  But Saltz has also referred to Beeple, one of the most prominent NFT artists, as “just really really derivative Sci-Fi and Conan and Star Wars crapola as far as imagery and imagination go. Whatever the medium, they’re just bad kitsch.”  Most NFT artists are working in a similar popular vein, and have little to add to the artistic conversation taking place in critical venues and important tastemaking institutions (all of which, remember, are key to investment returns). If an NFT-focused artist started trying to penetrate the fine art world today, it would take that person years, if not decades, to build a career: Fine art offers huge rewards, but only at the end of a relentless and nebulous hustle. Crucially, this is not an industry that has made much progress in going online, and a serious art career still more or less requires living in a handful of art capitals.  But even if established artists truly embrace them and NFTs become a viable medium for younger artists, Lynn thinks NFTs still have to pay some dues as an investment before they can compete for the same buyers as blue-chip fine art. “A strategic asset class beats inflation and lacks correlation to other assets,” says Lynn. “I just don’t see any way that NFTs, with their volatility and short track record, fit that. It doesn’t feel like an investment to me.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,David Z.

42411911,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh4qP,1631195796,Riccardo Spagni,"Riccardo Spagni, also known by his internet handle “fluffypony,” was the lead maintainer of Monero, a privacy-centric cryptocurrency project that aims to obfuscate the linkability of transactions across source, quantity, and destination. Spagni is an entrepreneur who started his career in software development, and upon discovering the Monero project in 2014, dedicated his professional work to the community. He stepped down as its lead maintainer in December 2019.  Spagni entered the crypto space in 2011 by mining bitcoin, previously having success with an import/export business he started with his wife. The success provided him with the flexibility to explore mining, and he later began building and selling GPU mining tools. His exposure to the GPU mining community, which focused mainly on coins other than bitcoin, led him to discover Monero at its inception.  The Monero whitepaper was released by an anonymous person utilizing the pseudonym Nicholas van Saberhagen, who later vanished and never contributed to the project’s launch. “Bitmonero,” the project’s initial title, was launched by someone with the pseudonym “thankful_for_today.” This character went on to demand changes that caused tension within the community, therefore Spagni and six other core developers forked to Monero, the well-known privacy project utilized today.  In 2018, Spagni launched Tari with cofounder Naveen Jain. Tari is a merge-mined sidechain of monero, which is intended to support non-fungible tokens (NFTs), representing unique digital assets such as tickets, loyalty points, and video game items.  A year later, Spagni stepped down as the lead maintainer of Monero citing the move would “better streamline developments and collaborations.” Another long-term contributor to Monero known as “Snipa” was announced as the successor, though Spagni confirmed he would remain available to help out during times when Snipa was away.  In 2021, a warrant for Spagni’s arrest was issued by South African police over allegations the former Monero lead developer had stolen $100,000 from a previous employer. Brian Klein, a leading crypto-focused attorney who had previously represented Erik Vorhees and Charlie Shrem, was hired by Spagni a month after the warrant was issued to defend him.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | XMR,Matthew Kimmell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/riccardo-spagni,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b635f26c00a8017ab4b42e0ea0308ced3a84aad6-1200x569.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42415203,Qdxg6jMEJ6GhmjUz49WjpS,1631195782,ECB Signals ‘Moderate’ Slowdown in Asset Purchases; Bitcoin Rises,"Bitcoin was higher Thursday after the European Central Bank (ECB) said it would reduce the pace of asset purchases “moderately” under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) program for monetary stimulus.  “The Governing Council judges that favorable financing conditions can be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases,” the ECB said in a statement.  Cryptocurrencies and risky traditional assets like stocks have been major beneficiaries of the liquidity-boosting asset-purchase programs launched by the ECB, Federal Reserve and other major central banks following the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020. So any reduction in the pace of these “quantitative easing” programs, known as QE, might prove a headwind for the bitcoin market.  But the limited scope of the ECB’s latest move shows the level of caution monetary policy makers are taking as they unwind the approach.  Bitcoin rose 1.8% Friday to $46,990.  The ECB snaps up assets worth €20 billion per month under its regular asset purchase program. Further, it has been purchasing government bonds worth €80 billion ($94.7 billion) a month under the PEPP scheme for over a year to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. According to Reuters, analysts expect the central bank to dial back purchases to €70 billion or €60 billion in the coming months.  While the announcement suggests a move away from the pro-easing bias, the details show just how accommodative the ECB remains.  The central bank said it will continue to conduct PEPP purchases in a total envelope of €1,850 billion until at least March 2022 – indicating that the overall size of the program hasn’t changed – while maintaining the deposit facility rate, main refinancing rate, and marginal lending facility rate unchanged at historically low levels of -0.5%, 0.00%, and -0.50%, respectively. Further, it will continue to buy €20 billion under the asset purchase program.  “The optics may suggest a more hawkish tilt, but essentially this will be balanced out by continued (and likely higher) regular APP [asset purchase program] once the PEPP envelope expires in March next year,” ForexLive’s Justin Low noted.  So bitcoin could recover lost ground during the day ahead, as investors dig deeper into the data. The euro is struggling to rise despite the hawkish ECB. The euro-dollar exchange rate saw a minor pop from 1.1824 to 1.1840, in a knee-jerk reaction, only to fall back to 1.1810.

The surprise acquisition announced Thursday by the companies in a press release gives Mastercard the ability to track over 900 cryptocurrencies. Details of the acquisition were not disclosed.  The deal is the latest sign of robust activity in the crypto tracing sector as governments and banks look to ramp up monitoring and compliance.  Earlier this year, Daniel Loeb’s Third Point Ventures led a $27 million investment in CipherTrace. That round was on the heels of a $100 million Series D that valued competing firm Chainalysis at $4.2 billion.

Larimer is the creator of the delegated-proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus model, in which elected delegates validate transactions and create blocks. He is also the former chief technology officer of EOS.IO creator Block.one.  In 2013, Larimer co-founded Bitshares, a decentralized exchange integrating a technology Larimer invented, Graphene. Bitshares uses a native token, BTS, and is structured as a decentralized autonomous corporation, in which there is supposedly no central authority. The goal of this project is to become an e-commerce platform that allows merchants and customers to trade and to minimize the costs providers and consumers incur every time a service is performed. Larimer has highlighted the losses both parties incur when converting bitcoin to dollars to explain the project's aims.  In 2016, Larimer co-founded Steem, a decentralized social networking platform, which rewards content curators, publishers and user attention with STEEM tokens. Steem’s most popular app, Steemit, allows users to post blurbs and articles, and, depending on ""upvotes,"" distributes tokens to the creators of popular content. Steemit is comparable to Twitter and Medium in design and function, but it differs as content is published to the immutable Steem blockchain and accounts receive payouts in cryptocurrency.  In 2017, along with the developers at Block.one, Larimer created EOS, a smart contract platform for building decentralized applications and facilitating decentralized storage. The blockchain, which was designed as an Ethereum competitor, aims to eliminate transaction fees while scaling to millions of transactions per second. Block.one raised $4 billion through a yearlong initial coin offering (ICO) to develop the project.  At the start of 2021, Larimer announced his departure from Block.one after almost 4 years as the company’s Chief Technology Officer.  “I will continue on my mission to create free market, voluntary solutions for securing life, liberty, property and justice for all.

42411926,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh5ah,1631193015,How To Buy Bitcoin,"So you’ve learned the basics of bitcoin, now you’re excited about its potential and want to buy some. But how?  Compared with when Bitcoin first launched in 2009, buying cryptocurrency has gotten easier by the day. Today, you can purchase bitcoin directly on crypto exchanges, mobile payment apps, peer-to-peer marketplaces, Bitcoin ATMs and even on some traditional brokerage platforms. Bitcoin ETFs are also a viable option for those hesitant to hold actual bitcoin. The list is quite elaborate.  You can also opt to use hard cash, credit or debit cards, or wire transfers, depending on whom and where you are buying from.  Now, before you buy your first bitcoin, you must decide how you want to store it. Think of this as having a bank account or physical wallet to keep your money.  In the case of bitcoin, you can use an online wallet in the form of an exchange platform or an independent provider, a mobile wallet, a desktop wallet or an offline wallet such as a hardware device or a paper wallet. You can find more information on bitcoin wallets and tips on how to use them here.  That being said, here’s a quick rundown on how you can buy the leading cryptocurrency.  Cryptocurrency exchanges  One of the easiest ways to buy bitcoin is via cryptocurrency exchanges. As the name suggests, a crypto exchange is a platform that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies using different traditional fiat money options or other digital currencies.  To buy bitcoin on a crypto exchange, you will need to open an account on the exchange platform. Chances are that you may also be required to go through some know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) procedures – these are just basic background checks so that the crypto exchange knows you are who you say you are. This typically entails submitting your official ID and sometimes your proof of address. On the flip side, some exchanges give you restricted access and benefits when you sign up with just your email without verifying your identity. This is a perfect option if you wish to stay anonymous and don’t plan to buy a large amount of bitcoin.  Speaking of crypto exchanges, while there are hundreds of them to choose from, as a beginner, it is recommended that you stick with popular high-volume exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Houbi and Kraken. However, it’s always advisable to conduct your own research before selecting a particular exchange to use. Some are available only to people from certain countries, while others are geared toward more experienced traders.  Once you’ve picked an exchange to use, the next step is to fund your account in order to purchase bitcoin. Most exchanges would allow you to fund your account through bank transfers, credit cards or PayPal.  Keep in mind that most platforms will charge fees for certain funding options, such as credit card deposits. In addition to charging deposit fees, you will also need to pay a fee for every transaction, to incentivize a bitcoin miner to process your transaction.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  Once your account is funded, you can then proceed to buy bitcoin on your chosen exchange.  Note that the exchange will automatically generate a wallet for you. The downside of this is that you don’t have control over your private key – the key that determines who the true owner is of the cryptocurrency stored in the wallet – and could potentially lose some of all of your bitcoin if the exchange is hacked. This, however, is a great option if you plan on exchanging your bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies and taking small profits from price swings.  If you plan to buy a significant amount of bitcoin without a plan to sell any time soon, you are better off moving your funds to an offline or hardware wallet.  Bitcoin ETFs  For investors interested in bitcoin but hesitant to engage directly with cryptocurrencies, a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) presents an attractive alternative. A spot bitcoin ETF tracks the price of bitcoin and allows investors to gain exposure to its price movements without owning bitcoin directly.  Read More: Bitcoin ETFs Explained: What Are They & How Do They Work?  Unlike traditional ETFs that might invest in a range of assets, spot bitcoin ETFs directly track the price of bitcoin. They hold actual bitcoin, and their shares are traded on traditional stock exchanges. You can also gain exposure to bitcoin’s price movements by buying bitcoin futures ETFs, which may be more easily available in different jurisdictions.  Investors interested in gaining exposure to bitcoin via ETFs should conduct thorough research to find the ETF that suits their investment goals and risk tolerance. Consider factors such as management fees, the track record of the ETF provider and how closely the ETF tracks the price of bitcoin.  If you already have a brokerage account, you can simply buy shares of a spot bitcoin ETF just as you would with any other stock. If you don’t have an account, you’ll need to set one up and fund it.  Mobile payment apps  Bitcoin's rise in popularity has significantly impacted the financial technology sector. Mobile payment apps such as Venmo, Cash App and PayPal have adapted to this trend by integrating services that enable users to buy, sell and hold bitcoin directly within their platforms.  These apps offer a convenient and accessible way to purchase bitcoin quickly from a mobile device. This approach may be suitable for individuals with limited knowledge of bitcoin who still seek exposure to it.  However, there are drawbacks to this convenience. Like crypto exchanges, when you buy bitcoin on mobile payment apps, you don’t own the private keys to your bitcoin wallet, meaning less control over your cryptocurrency. Transactions may also incur fees that can be higher than those on dedicated crypto exchanges. However, most of these apps charge nothing if moving bitcoin to another account on the platform.  Peer-to-peer bitcoin markets  While crypto exchanges may have grown to become the de facto way to buy bitcoin, you can also purchase the digital asset directly from other bitcoin owners via peer-to-peer platforms like Paxful, Binance P2P and NoOnes. This is also known as over-the-counter (OTC) trading.  Buying bitcoin directly from individuals can be extremely risky. Meeting a complete stranger face to face to privately exchange money for cryptocurrency doesn’t always work out for the best. Platforms like Paxful, Binance P2P and NoOnes offer a much safer solution and use an in-house escrow service to ensure the exchange process runs smoothly.  Peer-to-peer bitcoin markets may not be available in all countries. Geographic regulations can significantly impact the availability of peer-to-peer bitcoin exchanges. Regions with strict legal frameworks, stringent KYC and AML policies, complex taxation or onerous payment service laws can hinder the operation and accessibility of these platforms.  Bitcoin ATMs  Bitcoin ATMs operate similarly to regular cash ATMs. The main difference is they allow you to buy and sell bitcoin, as opposed to just withdrawing fiat. These devices will send bitcoin to your wallet in exchange for cash. All you need to do is feed in the bills, hold your wallet’s QR code up to a screen and the corresponding amount of bitcoin is beamed to your account.  Several Bitcoin ATM companies have struck deals with third party ATM providers to make it possible to buy bitcoin in convenience stores, gas stations and on city blocks. Coinatmradar can help you to find a Bitcoin ATM near you.  A similar option to buying bitcoin via a Bitcoin ATM is to purchase gift cards like Azteco or similar vouchers designed to buy and spend small amounts of crypto.  Although Bitcoin ATMs are typically safe to use and a legitimate way to purchase bitcoin, they are unfortunately being taken advantage of by scammers. The United States Federal Trade Commission has stated that scammers are impersonating legitimate government organizations or authorities and demanding payment via bitcoin purchased at Bitcoin ATMs, claiming it’s for taxes, fines or other official expenses. Victims believing they are dealing with a legitimate entity use the ATM to transfer bitcoin to the scammer. Never make a bitcoin purchase unless it is of your own volition. Never transfer bitcoin to a wallet that you do not have control over or access to, unless you are making a payment for goods or services.  Traditional stock brokers  Thanks to the growing popularity of bitcoin, several traditional brokers and FinTech brokerages now allow customers to buy and sell the digital asset on their platforms. Robinhood is a pioneer in this regard. It is the first mainstream investment broker to allow customers to purchase bitcoin on its platform, along with a selection of other cryptocurrencies. Its crypto arm, Robinhood Crypto, is also available in most states in the U.S. Similarly, you can also buy bitcoin on broker platforms such as eToro and TradeStation.  Several banks as well have begun offering crypto trading desks, often for their high net worth clientele. Likewise, financial advisers and wealth managers may also be able to buy and hold bitcoin on their clients’ behalf.  How to securely store purchased bitcoin  Transferring purchased bitcoin to a personal wallet is vital for ensuring security and control over one’s assets. Crypto exchanges and mobile payment apps, while convenient for trading, can be targets for hackers and may also face regulatory or internal issues, risking asset accessibility.  Read More: Your First Crypto Wallet: What Is a Crypto Wallet and How to Use It  Personal bitcoin wallets grant users full control over their private keys, diminishing the threat of theft or loss due to a failure on the part of a crypto exchange or money transfer app.  Securing bitcoin in a personal wallet involves several key steps.  Choose a reputable wallet: Choose a well-known and secure bitcoin wallet. There are two main types of wallets: hot wallets (online wallets) and cold wallets (offline storage).  undefined  Transfer your bitcoin: After purchasing bitcoin through an exchange or app, transfer it to your wallet by following the prompts on the exchange or app. You will send the bitcoin from the crypto exchange or app to your personal bitcoin wallet using the public address of your wallet. Ensure the public address is correct. It is impossible to reverse a bitcoin transaction. This public address will be generated automatically when you set up your bitcoin wallet.  Keep your private keys safe: Having ownership of your own private keys allows you to access and control your bitcoin. Never share them with anyone and ensure they are stored securely. If using a cold wallet, make sure to keep it in a safe place where it will not be lost or stolen.  Use strong passwords and 2FA: For any online wallet or exchange, use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security.

42411927,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh5hJ,1631192438,How Does Blockchain Technology Work?,"As stated in our guide “What is Blockchain Technology?”, there are three principal technologies that combine to create a blockchain. None of them are new. Rather, it is their orchestration and application that is new.  These technologies are: 1) private key cryptography, 2) a distributed network with a shared ledger and 3) an incentive to service the network’s transactions, record-keeping and security.  The following is an explanation of how these technologies work together to secure digital relationships.  Cryptographic keys  Two people wish to transact over the internet.  Each of them holds a private key and a public key.  The main purpose of this component of blockchain technology is to create a secure digital identity reference. Identity is based on possession of a combination of private and public cryptographic keys.  The combination of these keys can be seen as a dexterous form of consent, creating an extremely useful digital signature.  In turn, this digital signature provides strong control of ownership.  But strong control of ownership is not enough to secure digital relationships. While authentication is solved, it must be combined with a means of approving transactions and permissions (authorisation).  For blockchains, this begins with a distributed network.  A Distributed Network  The benefit and need for a distributed network can be understood by the ‘if a tree falls in the forest’ thought experiment.  If a tree falls in a forest, with cameras to record its fall, we can be pretty certain that the tree fell. We have visual evidence, even if the particulars (why or how) may be unclear.  Much of the value of the bitcoin blockchain is that it is a large network where validators, like the cameras in the analogy, reach a consensus that they witnessed the same thing at the same time. Instead of cameras, they use mathematical verification.  In short, the size of the network is important to secure the network.  That is one of the bitcoin blockchain’s most attractive qualities — it is so large and has amassed so much computing power. At time of writing, bitcoin is secured by 3,500,000 TH/s, more than the 10,000 largest banks in the world combined. Ethereum, which is still more immature, is secured by about 12.5 TH/s, more than Google and it is only two years old and still basically in test mode.  System of record  When cryptographic keys are combined with this network, a super useful form of digital interactions emerges. The process begins with A taking their private key, making an announcement of some sort — in the case of bitcoin, that you are sending a sum of the cryptocurrency — and attach it to B’s public key.  Protocol  A block – containing a digital signature, timestamp and relevant information – is then broadcast to all nodes in the network.  A realist might challenge the tree falling in the forest thought experiment with the following question: Why would there be a million computers with cameras waiting to record whether a tree fell? In other words, how do you attract computing power to service the network to make it secure?  For open, public blockchains, this involves mining. Mining is built off a unique approach to an ancient question of economics — the tragedy of the commons.  With blockchains, by offering your computer processing power to service the network, there is a reward available for one of the computers. A person’s self-interest is being used to help service the public need.  With bitcoin, the goal of the protocol is to eliminate the possibility that the same bitcoin is used in separate transactions at the same time, in such a way that this would be difficult to detect.  This is how bitcoin seeks to act as gold, as property. Bitcoins and their base units (satoshis) must be unique to be owned and have value. To achieve this, the nodes serving the network create and maintain a history of transactions for each bitcoin by working to solve proof-of-work mathematical problems.  They basically vote with their CPU power, expressing their agreement about new blocks or rejecting invalid blocks. When a majority of the miners arrive at the same solution, they add a new block to the chain. This block is timestamped, and can also contain data or messages.  Here’s a chain of blocks:  The type, amount and verification can be different for each blockchain. It is a matter of the blockchain’s protocol – or rules for what is and is not a valid transaction, or a valid creation of a new block. The process of verification can be tailored for each blockchain. Any needed rules and incentives can be created when enough nodes arrive at a consensus on how transactions ought to be verified.  It’s a taster’s choice situation, and people are only starting to experiment.  We are currently in a period of blockchain development where many such experiments are being run. The only conclusions drawn so far are that we are yet to fully understand the dexterity of blockchain protocols.

Not just Bitcoin, major altcoins, including Ether, Binance Coin, and Solana, etc., took a hit, which resulted in a significant amount of crypto liquidations in the derivative market. Reasons Bitcoin flash crash on Tuesday The price of Bitcoin dropped by over 11 percent from a high of $51,101 to $45,299 according to Coingecko. However, major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase recorded as low as $42,900. Overall, the Bitcoin flash crash resulted in an 11.6 percent drop in whole crypto market capitalization, to $2.16 billion. Firstly, it&apos;s worth noting that the incident came as a reminder of how volatile Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are.

42394449,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdZEz,1631190600,5 Ways Bitcoin Can Play a Role in a Portfolio,"Recently, a well-known bitcoin writer tweeted, “If your financial advisor hasn’t recommended bitcoin yet, fire them.” A tweet like this gets polarizing quickly. Right or wrong, there is greater nuance to the role of bitcoin in portfolios.  As a fiduciary, you cannot disregard an asset that is the best-performing asset of the 21st century. Whether that sits well with you or not, bitcoin is not going anywhere. So what are some of the ways bitcoin can fit into the portfolios of the future? Below, I’ll guide you through some of the main narratives for incorporating bitcoin into a portfolio.  This column originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here.  Digital gold  I have used the “digital gold” narrative early in my bitcoin journey, but cryptocurrency is far more than a gold replacement. The role that gold has historically played is protecting wealth: An ounce of gold in Roman times bought you a nice tunic, and an ounce of gold today buys you a nice suit. The idea of maintaining your purchasing power has been gold’s appeal. The inflation rate of gold is below 2%, so you can store wealth over generations as its devaluation happens slowly versus a purely fiat-backed currency. So if you only see bitcoin as a commodity holding to replace gold, then a weighting like Ray Dalio’s risk-parity recommendation to allocate to gold would make sense. A 7.5% weight for bitcoin then would be the recommendation under this type of approach.  Growth sleeve  If you like the idea of a core and satellite approach, you may want to allocate to thematic growth themes. The concept of core and satellite is to own the broad market, but to complement that with a 10%-20% allocation in opportunities you view as being able to outperform. Bitcoin is the fastest-growing asset of the past decade, so it fits into that narrative.  You can also look at the network effects of big tech, such as Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook – once a dominant digital network surpasses $100 billion market cap, it’s here to stay. Bitcoin today has crept right back under the $1 trillion market cap. Venture capital has historically looked at where the demand curve is today versus where opportunity via adoption cycles is going, and network effects are powerful. People usually learn and share a tool or technology and then need to see a massive 10x or greater improvement to then move and “upgrade” to what’s better. A maximum of 10% weight would be the recommendation under this approach.  Credit insurance (bonds)  Greg Foss, a veteran trader with more than 30 years of experience in high-yield credit markets, is whom I credit with the idea of bitcoin being default insurance for fixed-income investors. In a recent piece, Foss articulated the contagion and cascading risk in the credit markets for bond investors, claiming that today the biggest risks are in credit markets, where risks can get hidden from the average investor.  Think of collateralized debt obligations in 2008 – the lessons from that period were not learned and are being repeated via looser and looser credit ratings on bond holdings as everyone is chasing yield in a world of low rates. The counterparty risk is usually unknown until it is too late – but bitcoin, when self-custodied, has no counterparty risk. This peace of mind and security is undervalued in today’s market.  Foss doesn’t claim that bitcoin’s price wouldn’t be affected in a credit meltdown, but that event would be a buying opportunity as more and more investors learn the merits of counterparty risk. The recommendation here for the client with a 60/40 portfolio, which has 60% in equities and 40% in bonds, is a 5% weight from their bond exposure.  Dragon portfolio  Chris Cole of Artemis Capital Management wrote a research paper titled Rise of the Dragon: From Deflation to Reflation. He advocates that everyone construct a portfolio that can last 100 years regardless of what the markets do over any given cycle. The Dragon Portfolio is constructed to be resilient and offer actual diversification; the allocation includes equities, bonds, commodity trend, gold and long volatility. Each is between an 18% and 24% weight, so it’s almost an equal-weight approach. All of these holdings counterbalance each other to allow for a unique, independent return generator.  By avoiding large corrections, the compounding over years leads to a better 100-year portfolio that Cole argues cannot be beat. If you believe in his detailed research, it makes sense that bitcoin will replace gold given that we are moving from an analog age to a digital one. Gold has passed the baton to bitcoin, and it slides into that allocation for this portfolio style. It does not correlate with any other of the allocation weights and provides an independent return stream. A 19% weight would be the recommendation in this approach.  Equity exposed companies  I can hear you now: What if your client won’t own bitcoin directly, and you don’t like the idea of paying 2% for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the main way investors have sought exposure to bitcoin without their own wallets? (Disclosure: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.) I’d suggest adding the stocks of bitcoin miners and others that hold bitcoin on their balance sheet.  The most well-known company with a bitcoin balance sheet is MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor. An allocation to an index-style approach here provides exposure, allowing an equity weighting versus owning bitcoin directly. I would not say this is a 1:1 replacement, but it could be a solution for you today. This then allows you to get up to speed on the proper way to help clients own the asset directly. The recommendation here is of no more than a 5% weight for one company, and a basket approach is best.  Moving forward: Bitcoin as a problem solver  All of the above narratives give you various rationales and different conclusions on the appropriate weight to hold in bitcoin for clients. When looking at the risk of owning bitcoin, even a “Mark Yusko position” of getting off zero and holding 1% is far less risky in the long run than owning 0%. Yusko is the founder, CEO and chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management and the managing partner of Morgan Creek Digital. He has worked in the endowment space for years and worked with some of the largest allocators in the U.S.  When you run a financial plan for clients, for instance, how often do you run a scenario of the U.S. dollar losing its reserve status? When do you run the consistent and accelerating devaluation of the U.S. dollar in a plan? Never? The facts are that bitcoin, even in a small amount, allows you to solve this what-if for clients. You can run a scenario of a small allocation of bitcoin going to $0 and the client still having a successful outcome.  The role of a financial plan should be to provide peace of mind and certainty. We’ve all seen clients become too conservative too early and jeopardize their future success – the same can be said for advisors who refuse to review the merits of bitcoin in a financial plan.  Bitcoin helps solve a real issue for clients trying not to outlive their money. Only you, as the partner to your clients, can know what the right fit is for bitcoin, but the evidence is clear that it does belong in everyone’s portfolio.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | ZRX,Isaiah Douglass,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/09/crypto-for-advisors-5-ways-bitcoin-can-play-a-role-in-a-portfolio,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a162c5ff3d6a20c25569a25ab416d8bab4d6758d-5428x3619.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394456,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdZot,1631190600,How Do You Value Digital Assets?,"When I was first asked to write this column for CoinDesk, I called an old acquaintance, financial advisor and OnRamp Investing CEO Tyrone Ross, who has channeled his exuberance into proselytizing and teaching the benefits of cryptocurrency investing to financial advisors.  I wanted to pick Ross’ brain on what he thought our industry most needed to know about digital assets – and one of the first things out of his mouth was valuation.  This column originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here.  “As far as literacy is concerned, the biggest trip-up for advisors is still the valuation methodology for crypto assets,” Ross said. “There is no way to discount cash flows for crypto assets. You need to embrace new valuation methodologies like daily active users or network access. If you’re still talking about price-to-earnings ratios, discounted cash flows or the capital asset pricing model, you need to realize that those terms do not apply here. The old models don’t fit.”  Most advisors are well versed on valuation methodology for traditional assets like stocks, bonds and real estate, though these asset classes have their own unique characteristics and there are ongoing debates about the best way to value them and how to use that information.  For example, many professionals have abandoned the once widely practiced method of using a ratio of a stock’s current price to the book value of its business as a measure of whether it is expensive or not. Still others contend that in a world full of intellectual and virtual property, the discounted cash-flow methodologies of venerated investors like Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett are no longer as relevant to a company’s value as they once were.  If we can understand how technology and digital breadth can make a company worth more than its tangible parts, maybe we can understand how an entirely digital asset could retain value without any of those tangible parts.  What are digital assets worth?  The fundamentals of fiat currencies are founded upon their utility as stores of value, units of measurement and mediums of exchange. Most cryptocurrencies have similar characteristics, but because much of the trading thus far has been speculative, they’re an asset class where technical analysis reigns supreme. The actual fundamentals of cryptocurrencies are still being explored by technologists and academics alike.  “In many cases, it’s the hands-on users who know more about what is going on with the technology and understand these business models and the ‘tokenomics’ of their projects more than any advisor would,” said Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research for VanEck, a traditional asset manager that was an early entrant into the digital assets space. “That’s why I look at Reddit and see who is trading code on GitHub. These are open-source technologies, for the most part; no company is building them, so you can go read what developers are building and what participants expect as far as the economics around a token and its features.”  In my previous column, Sarson Funds Chief Marketing Officer Jahon Jamali told us that most cryptocurrencies can be valued based on the size of the network participating in their underlying blockchain.  That sounds great, but what does it mean, exactly? Goldman Sachs published a note in July confirming that the free-float market capitalization of major cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, litecoin and XRP, actually does correlate to the network size. We can use network size and Metcalfe’s law, a mathematical principle that the value of any network is the square of its number of participants, to figure out what these tokens are worth.  Of course, that means we have to find true and relevant methods of measuring the size of a network. Just as price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios may not tell the whole story about the values of today’s stock market leaders, we need to find the right metrics to uncover the size of a cryptocurrency’s underlying network.  Key metrics  On-chain metrics give us information about the activity across a blockchain, including transaction count over a set period, or the total value of transactions over that period, active addresses, hashrates and fees paid.  Project metrics tell us the thinking behind a cryptocurrency, the technology it uses, its use cases and the supply and distribution plan for tokens. Finally, financial metrics tell us the market capitalization of the asset, its liquidity and its volume.  With some metrics in hand, it’s up to us to use them in meaningful ways to describe the value of a digital asset. One proposed method is the network value-to-transaction ratio, or NVT ratio, calculated by dividing the market-capitalization of a digital asset by the transaction value over a set period. Another method, market-value-to-real-value ratio, or MVRV, is the ratio between the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency to the value of tokens stuck or abandoned in inactive wallets. MVRV is an expression of relative value that may indicate whether a token is overvalued or undervalued.  Why it matters  “Trust officers and estate attorneys need to make decisions on digital assets, but there’s no industry standard yet,” said Whitney Solcher, chief investment officer of Ulrich Investment Consultants, a registered investment advisor (RIA) with $2 billion in assets under management. “How do you value them? How will they be taxed? How do you transfer them on to the next generations?”  There are some advisors who understand full well some of the valuation techniques behind digital assets, but are still hesitant to embrace them. Ulrich, for example, runs most of its investments in-house and follows the cryptocurrency space closely, but has decided to hold off on investing in digital assets.  “Broadly, as financial advisors, we have a hard time assessing actual cryptocurrencies as true money, and we don’t feel they are really a store of value now given their volatility,” said Solcher. “We do, however, believe in the technology, and that’s the place we’re more comfortable putting our investment dollars.”  Solcher said that Ulrich accesses the blockchain technology world through investments in companies such as PayPal, Amazon and JPMorgan Chase.  But the prevailing trend is that fewer advisors today spend their time valuing their clients’ stocks and bonds than in the past, investment management is more often than not outsourced, and thus, it’s less important that advisors know the intricacies of cryptocurrency valuation. Instead, they should be able to translate these fundamentals to their clients in a digestible way while being able to access digital assets through a variety of products and strategies.  So yes, moving forward we will need to know why a digital asset like bitcoin or ethereum has intrinsic value, but we probably won’t be called to calculate that value in real time.",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/09/crypto-for-advisors-how-do-you-value-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f23040769446b4ba5c5f3ece0619054762658a8-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415210,Qdxg6jMEJ6GhmjUz49Wjwo,1631177591,SOL Tops $200 as Google Search Data Shows Peak Retail Interest,"Solana’s SOL went above $200 on Thursday, the fourth straight day the smart-contract blockchain’s token reached a record high.  The cryptocurrency has chalked up a fivefold rally in the past 30 days, courtesy of renewed interest in Ethereum alternatives amid the explosive growth of non-fungible tokens (NFT). Money has been flowing into Solana and other Ethereum alternatives capable of handling a much larger volume of transactions for lower fees compared to Ethereum, the world’s largest smart contract blockchain.  SOL’s rally, however, may cool because web search figures show the peak popularity of the token in the general populace. That’s often observed at major price tops.  Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge general or retail interest in trending topics, is currently returning a value of 100 for the worldwide search query “how to buy solana” over the past 12 months. The worldwide search query for the term “Solana” is also returning a value of 100 at press time.  A score of 100 represents peak popularity – the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time frame. It means more and more people are scanning the web for information on how to buy SOL, which has outperformed market leaders bitcoin and ether by leaps and bounds in recent weeks.  Google Trends provides access to a mostly unfiltered sample of actual search requests made to Google and scales their searches on a range of 0 to 100, according to the company. The search value represents the search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the selected region and time.  General interest began rising with Solana’s launch of the NFT project Degenerate Apes on Aug. 15. The token also began its near-vertical rise around the same time.  Peak popular interest does not necessarily imply an increase in actual buying pressure from retail investors. Often, investors search for information but don’t act. That said, a value of 100 for the search query “how to buy solana” does show retail investors are eager to step in (or some may have already bought).  Retail investors have a reputation for being the last entrants in a bull run, and their entry often coincides with the exit of large investors and major market tops. Bitcoin’s 2017 bull run peaked with the Google search value for the term “bitcoin” rising to 100 in December. Similar web search values were observed in January and April this year, signaling a retail frenzy. Bitcoin peaked above $64,000 in April.  Peak general interest in SOL is accompanied by an above-70, or overbought, reading on the relative strength index, a widely tracked technical analysis. The above-70 reading indicates the rally is overdone, and the asset could see some consolidation or correction.  SOL’s social volume, or the number of mentions of the coin on crypto social media channels, including Telegram groups, and crypto subreddits tracked by analytics firm Santiment, reached a record high of 8,802 this week before decoupling from the rising price on Wednesday. High levels of crowd chatter often work as a contrary indicator.  Investment banking giant JPMorgan has warned of froth and retail investor mania in SOL, Cardano’s ADA and crypto exchange Binance’s BNB token, according to Forbes.  “The August rally in non-fungible tokens and the pickup in decentralized finance activity have helped not only ethereum but also alternative cryptocurrencies that facilitate or plan to facilitate smart contracts,” such as SOL, Binance coin and ADA, JPMorgan said. “The previous phase of retail investors’ mania into cryptocurrency markets was between the beginning of January and mid-May … and retail investors are making cryptocurrency markets look frothy again.”  Most NFTs on Solana, including the Degenerate Ape Academy, have seen a drop in volumes in the past 24 hours, according to Solanalysis.com. While collectibles on Solana have generated $95 million worth of trading volume over the past seven days, the week-on-week growth rate is pretty flat.  The broader NFT boom is also showing signs of cooling. OpenSea, the world’s largest NFT marketplace, registered a trading volume of less than $100 million on Wednesday, the lowest since Aug. 21, per Dune Analytics. Other popular NFTs like Loot and CryptoPunk have also seen a sharp drop in trading volumes in the past 24 hours.  All things considered, SOL’s bullish momentum may slow and the cryptocurrency could see a price pullback.

At ISW’s POD CITY facility in Georgia, the Antminers will be operational with 20 megawatts of power by October of this year, according to a Wednesday press release. ISW plans the facility to run at 200 megawatts by October 2022.  For the entire 200 MW, ISW expects to shell out $62 million, of which It has so far paid $6 million, according to the press release.  The deal is one of many moves this summer by Chinese miners to move out of China, with North America being a particularly attractive destination. Even before the latest China crackdown started in May, many rig manufacturers had their books full of orders from North America due to increased investment in the U.S. and Canada.  Nevada-based ISW Holdings puts in funding, access to electricity and public markets, while Bit5ive is bringing electricity power. Both of them will provide hosting services for Bitmain’s rigs. The deal was first revealed in July.  ISW currently operates 700 rigs, S19s, S17s and Canaan’s Avalons in a mine managed by Bit5ive in Pennsylvania.

They are often used as a tool for ownership and identity verification in the blockchain ecosystem. NFTs can also be used to represent physical assets, such as collectibles, artworks, or even shoes. In recent years, NFTs have gained traction among non-traditional investors and blockchain enthusiasts. This is due in large part to their unique attributes: they are more scarce than fungible assets like fiat currencies and stocks, which makes them enticing investments for those who prefer something unique and one-of-a-kind. The use cases for NFTs extend far beyond investment vehicles and into the realms of art collecting, gaming economies, virtual land ownership, and more. One example is Next Earth, which recently ran the world&apos;s first Initial Tile Offering, selling over $1.3 million of virtual real estate NFTs. In the future, Next Earth plans to release &apos;pixel art&apos; features that let users not only buy one-of-a-kind virtual land, but create land art on it as well. Collectibles featuring rare skins or other digital enhancements have become increasingly popular as well. Why NFTs Are Needed One of the main reasons NFTs are gaining traction is because people want to prove ownership digitally. For example, a digital artist or game developer may choose to release their work as an NFT, in order to show proof of ownership and prevent people from pirating the work.
