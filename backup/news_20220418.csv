42374909,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw3W9B,1650325448,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Minnows Have Pushed the Whales to the Side; Bitcoin, Ether Steady","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin dipped to a five-week low around $38,547 early Monday before bouncing back up above $40,000 later in the day.  Insights: The size of the main swimmers in the crypto sea has changed.  Technician's take: BTC appears to be oversold on intraday charts.

All in all, though, the price action looked pretty tame – just another day spent in a now months-long range between about $36,000 and $48,000. As of press time the largest cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands around $40,800.  ""In digital assets,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at the crypto fund manager Arca, wrote Tuesday in his newsletter, ""a boring market is often viewed as a weak market, because if it’s not going up, it must be going down.""  ""Bored traders in digital asset markets become impatient traders, which leads to a lot of pushing on a string,"" Dorman said.  Ether (ETH) briefly dipped below $3,000, reaching a low of $2,880 earlier in the day before recovering back over $3,000.  Traditional markets were pretty anemic on Monday as well. See below.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,392, -0.01%  DJIA: 34,412, -0.1%  Nasdaq: 13,332, -0.1%  Gold: $1,981/ounce, -0.3%  Insights  Bitcoin Whales Are Out, Minnows Are In  Bitcoin critics often accuse the world’s largest digital asset of being too centralized and controlled by a cabal of elite “whales” much like the traditional financial system.  But data from Glassnode shows that throughout 2022 this has become less the case, with the mid-tier whales (holding 100-1,000 BTC, or less than around $40 million) trimming their exposure and the “minnows” picking it up.     Late January was a rough time for crypto. Meta (FB), the entity formerly known as Facebook, released rough earnings, making many investors question the firm’s metaverse shift and weighing down heavy on metaverse majors. Concerns at the time over the year’s first U.S. Federal Reserve meeting also brought down stocks, which in 2022’s narrative also means crypto. Weak demand from Asia, then shut down because of the long Lunar New Year holiday, didn’t help much.  All of this is normal, Morgan Stanley (MS) wrote at the time, pointing out that dramatic slides were nothing new for crypto.  Prices were naturally compressed and the whales took this as a chance to sell. The supply of bitcoin held by addresses that have between 100-1,000 BTC fell off a cliff, while the supply of bitcoin held by wallets with 0.1-10 bitcoin dramatically increased.  Almost in parallel, the number of short-term holders increased showing that this was new money flowing into bitcoin.  This correction gave retail investors a good chance to get into the market while distributing the holdings of bitcoin across many, not few, hands. It also shows that retail investors continue to have confidence in bitcoin and used this chance to augment their holdings.  The same was happening with equities; retail participation increased during the turbulent first few months of the year. The Financial Times newspaper reported that retail continues to buy the dip.  Now here’s the exception: Retail investors also say the market is rigged against them. Is there a similar survey for crypto investors?  Technician's take  By Damanick Dantes  Bitcoin Holding Support Above $37K; Resistance at $45K  Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be stabilizing after a 15% decline over the past two weeks. So far, the cryptocurrency is holding support above $37,000, similar to what occurred in early March.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is rising from oversold levels despite the recent downtrend in price. That could signal bullish activity toward the $45,000 resistance zone.  Still, BTC has remained in a tight trading range around the $40,000 price level over the past few months. A positive momentum signal on the daily chart is needed in order to signal a price recovery outside of the current trading range.  On the weekly chart, BTC is holding long-term support above its 100-week moving average at $35,700. Positive momentum readings remain intact over the intermediate term, albeit with bearish signals on the monthly chart.  Imortant Events  10 a.m. HKTSGT(2 am.

It had risen to its all-time high back in 2021 when the bull market was in full bloom. It then continued to maintain on the high spike, spiking at various intervals to high points. At its highest, average ETH gas fees were as high as $69. However, with the recent downtrend and the market losing momentum, the gas fees have crumbled and the recent decline has seen its near six-month lows. Ethereum Fees Are Down Ethereum gas fees for the last three months showed a consistent downtrend that saw average gas fees decline as low as $5.98 in early March. This had been the lowest that gas fees had been in seven months at this point. However, a spike in gas fees in early April would quickly put an end to this sending gas fees as high as $43 once more. This would prove to be only temporary given that the sharp downtrend that followed has sent ETH gas fees to plummet towards six-month lows.

42417139,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcSK3Zt,1650318017,Matthew Ball: Metaverse Man,"Metaverse, metaverse, metaverse! You hear it everywhere. It’s mainstream, it’s a trendy buzzword, it’s even corporate strategy du jour.  But that wasn’t the case in early 2018. And this is when Matthew Ball, a former head of strategy at Amazon Studios, began writing a series of metaverse-themed essays – long, lucid, influential essays – that are almost uncanny in their prescience.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  “Even if the metaverse falls short of the fantastical visions captured by science fiction authors, it is likely to produce trillions in value as a new computing platform or content medium,” Ball wrote in January 2020.  It’s a topic he had been chewing on for years.  “I’ve been familiar with the concept of the metaverse for decades,” Ball told me over the phone. “The literature surrounding that topic spans as far back as the 1930s.”  Ball’s metaverse education? Video games. He’s been an avid gamer for years, and he’s been paying close attention.  “Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Epic, has talked about the fact that they built metaverse-style functionality in the first Unreal Tournament in the late '90s for ‘unstructured non-game socializing and world creation,’” Ball says.  So the idea of the metaverse was not new. But in 2018, Ball noticed something different. He felt a shift.  “You saw an exponential increase in the number of engaged users,” he says in his precise and crystal-clear voice, noting that whereas Second Life had a few million users in its heyday, Fortnite swelled to 100 million each month.  “This behavior of unstructured socializing and creation – rather than playing a game – had gone from fringe and incidental to central to the experiences,” Ball says.  Now the venture capitalist (he's managing partner at Epyllionco) has updated and expanded these essays into a new book, “The Metaverse: And How it Will Change Everything.”  In a wide-ranging conversation, Ball opens up about his personal research habits (“I play a lot of video games”), his metaverse investment principles (think different, not the same), what he looks for in a founder and why the metaverse might not be exactly what you think.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Let’s start with your habits. You’re known for having very “Big Picture” thoughts on tech. What types of habits, or structure, do you maintain to keep such a wide perspective, and not get overwhelmed by all the constant news and noise?  Matthew Ball: I don't know the answer to that question. My days are very unstructured. What I can tell you from a pattern behavior is the following: I read a ton on Twitter and in the papers. I actually don't subscribe to any newsletters.  This is probably the most important thing: I spend a tremendous amount of my time – and I'm very privileged – participating in portfolio company Slacks or Telegrams or Signal Messengers. The wisest people in this space tend to be early-stage entrepreneurs. Reading their rants and having them explain what they think are the misunderstood narratives is really hard to replicate. There's probably two, three hours of my day that are relatively unstructured conversations with founders, entrepreneurs and business partners that develop and crystallize that understanding.  The other thing is, I play a lot of video games.  How much is a lot?  On average, probably between an hour and two every day. I really think that one of the biggest challenges for those investing in the space is that they actually don't play video games. I think that the space is so sophisticated, so nuanced and so quickly changing, that without having pretty constant exposure to it, it's hard to really have a grasp. The best part is that [playing video games] has become such a social medium that often I'm playing with founders and business partners, and so part of that rant/discussion/investigation discovery of news happens inside Fortnite or Call of Duty, rather than just during working hours.  You’ve just made thousands of gamers – maybe millions of gamers – very, very happy with this piece of advice. All of the gaming is “investment research”! What titles are you playing most these days?  I just finished Horizon Forbidden West. I'm in Fortnite, but then I'm cranking out Elden Ring.  Nice. On an adjacent question of personal habits, you mentioned that your life is very unstructured. But is there anything you do to put yourself in a space to think clearly? Such as meditation or naps or whatever?  Yeah. Not actively, but I think it's an inevitable byproduct. I run five to 10 kilometers a day. I'm usually watching or catching up on television during that time, but sometimes doing work or thinking. And then I'll usually hike for 60 to 90 minutes a day with my dog. And that's just fully off in the woods. So that's usually where I'm having a conversation, passively writing in my head, sometimes jotting things down, but often reflecting on work.  I’m glad you mentioned writing. You’ve spent so much energy writing long, thoughtful essays and then posting them for all to read. It almost feels like a throwback, as opposed to just sharing thoughts on Twitter. What drew you to that particular medium?  It's a good question. I've always just been drawn to it. I mean, I never wrote originally for an audience; I like to think I still don't. I wrote because I had something to say. I found the process illuminating. And I was fortunate to find an audience.  In general, and sometimes at the cost of my sanity, I feel a real compulsion to write, to get a piece out. It's actually very distracting to have it half-written, or 80% written or even 10% written. And so I'm just drawn to do that, to release it to get the feedback.  You’re known for your thoughtful essays, but also, of course, for your investments. At a high level, do you have any investment principles, or key questions you ask, when you consider an investment in the metaverse space? An investing prism or framework?  No, but I'll say the following. Generally, I like to bet that more things are going to be different than stay the same. Which is to say, we often see versions of “Uber for this” or “Airbnb for that” for the metaverse, right? It's going to be “dating, but for the metaverse.” Or “banking, but for the metaverse.”  I don't find that super-interesting. I usually look for people who say, ""Actually, we're going to date entirely different. It's not Tinder in 3D, it's something altogether dissimilar."" And you'll find that that's actually pretty well-established.  What’s an example?  Take a look at eHarmony or Match.com. The mobile versions of those are entirely different. Match or eHarmony said, “Spend two hours filling out 300 questions.” And Tinder says, “Spend three to seven seconds looking at a photo and swipe.” So I generally look for pitches that basically say that what we're going to do in 3D is gonna be very different than what we did in 2D.  Interesting. What do you look for in a founder?  I've personally found the most success with founders who often spend five to 10 years in today's [tech] giants being frustrated, not because the companies were wrong, but that the technology wasn't ready or the priorities were elsewhere.  And therefore, now they’re looking at the same problems a decade later, relatively unbridled with resources, and with a ton of learnings and frankly, a little bit of a chip on their shoulder, right? Because they've been trying to do this for a decade, and they really want it to come to fruition. That is by far my favorite founder.  Let’s get into the metaverse itself. How do you define the metaverse these days?  I try to describe it rather than to define it. The reason is that if you were to “define” the internet, you would basically say it's TCP/IP or the internet protocol. A very helpful definition to some, but it's not very good at describing the internet.  But more importantly, you'll find that even a description of the internet, “a network of networks that allows for the seamless, safe, secure, coherent, comprehensive transmission of data across networks, supporting images and emails,” isn't that helpful, either.  Right. So how do you describe the metaverse?  As a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds, which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users.  What you'll find is, definitions for the metaverse vary. In fact, there are disagreements as to whether or not the metaverse is here. John Carmack (chief technology officer at Oculus VR) and Mark Zuckerberg (CEO of Meta Platforms, Facebook's parent company) talk about how it's over the next five to 10 years. You'll find that Bill Gates, Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft) and Reid Hoffman (partner at Greylock, a venture capital firm) say that it's already here or it will be here within the next few years.  Tim Sweeney (CEO of Epic Games) and Jensen Wong (CEO of Nvidia) talk about how it's emerging over the next coming decades. They don't think it's started. I disagree with the use of the term metaverse as in singular, which is to say, “a metaverse” or “metaverses.” I think that that's akin to saying the Facebook internet, or the Google internet or the Microsoft internet.  And then lastly, I think you'll find a lot of people who conflate it with Web 3, I would say that those are related but distinct. And certainly, there are still a number of people who think that it's virtual reality.  More from 'Road to Consensus'  Sam Bankman-Fried: The Man, the Hair, the Vision  Cathy Hackl: The 'Godmother of the Metaverse'  Michael Levy: How to Turn Your NFT Into a Loan  Jeff Kauffman: DAOs Will Own Big Brands  You mentioned 3D in your description. Does that mean that for you, 3D is almost a necessary component of the metaverse?  I would say so, yeah. I think it's essential to differentiating it from the internet we've experienced for the past 40 years. It's also critical to many of the capabilities that we need and currently lack.  Give us a metaverse prediction. How could our lives be different once the metaverse matures?  Well, I'd say a few things. Firstly, we can absolutely predict some sort of “trough-to-metaverse” pipe. I think one of the challenges with how hot the theme has become over the past year is that our lives are not remarkably different. And there's going to be a period of time in which so many people say, ""We keep hearing about the metaverse, some people tell us it's already here, companies are investing billions. One company changed its name. Where's the fit?""  And that's going to lead to the traditional trough of disillusionment. We may go through that twice before we actually find that some version of the metaverse, as we envision, is actually realized.  That’s a good reality check. What else?  We'll also potentially find an outcome where the term is different. Tencent, for example, talks about “hyper-digital reality” rather than the metaverse. It may be that the term metaverse, defined as in singular, does [end up catching on]. So maybe we will end up using the phrase “a metaverse,” so “Roblox metaverse,” “Microsoft metaverse,” the “Epic metaverse,” in which case we'll devise a new term for that wrapping experience.  How about the experience of the metaverse itself?  I think there are a few different things that we can understand. First, the metaverse does not mean that all of the devices, and all of the interfaces, and all of the behaviors and practices of today go away. Consider the mobile era. Fifty-five percent of [internet] data starts and ends on a mobile device. And yet by that same token, nearly half isn't using a mobile device. And when you use a mobile device, as I'm using right now, almost all of the data transmission is happening on fixed-line infrastructure, even though we use the term mobile.  We're still mostly using TCP/IP, largely unchanged. That's the traditional internet from the 1980s. In the future, you'll find that in many instances, we'll still use the devices we use today. We'll still even use PCs. We'll still be using 2D interfaces. I struggle to believe that we’ll always, or we'll mostly want 3D to write an email. And in many instances, all we will want for a phone call is audio, least of all an augmented reality projection.  So how should we think about the metaverse, in that context?  Complementing some use cases, such as holography for a phone call. Or substituting for other use cases. There may be instances in which training, which used to be via digital PowerPoint, is now done in 3D, and that creates a new experience altogether.  A lot of that new experience is really interesting. I tend to be intellectually curious about two categories that are unique. They're extraordinarily large. They’re extraordinarily inefficient by most measures. And they’ve largely resisted disruption for the past four years.  These would be education and health care.  Why do they have so much potential?  If you take a look at the cost of education since 1983 when the internet began, it's up 1,400%. We have long been expecting the internet to disrupt those traditional services categories. You can go back any number of years and find futurists or media strategists talking about, ""College will forever change … Harvard will start issuing an online-only degree … Employers will consider it as valid as the in-person experience. And all of a sudden college tuition will drop!”  None of those things have really manifested. If you take a look at anything that's happened over the pandemic, it's reiteration of how awful Zoom school is.  So I'm really interested in the question of, how does immersive VR (virtual reality) or AR (augmented reality), and how does 3D real-time rendering and event simulation actually allow us to disrupt those categories? Can you actually feel like you're in the classroom? Rather than watching the YouTube stream or clicking the multiple-choice question, can you actually be in a science experiment in 3D? Can you dissect a virtual cat? All those things are fascinating to me. And we'll see those over the coming decade.  In your mind, what’s the biggest risk, or constraint, for the metaverse achieving mainstream adoption and maturation?  That's a good question. I have absolute faith that essentially, in perpetuity, an ever-growing share of our time – labor, leisure, wealth and happiness time – will be spent inside virtual worlds. And that, over time, will see the establishment and formulation of interoperability that produces the metaverse.  What's important to recognize is how many enormous technical constraints we have in front of us. Networking infrastructure is already a challenge to the ability to watch high quality or high-definition video. More than 75% of broadband homes in the Middle East can't reliably play a high-fidelity video game. Most devices globally, still don't have the requisite computing power for rich 3D virtualization.  And to the extent in which one believes in AR and VR as important device form factors, it's really difficult to express how extraordinarily limited those devices are and likely will be. I know many people deep in the field who believe staunchly that failing the establishment of quantum computing, or unprecedented innovations in battery power, we simply cannot have the VR or AR wearables that we envision.  See also: 'Crypto-States' Will Compete With Corporates in the Metaverse | Opinion  When the metaverse dust settles, do you think that things will tilt toward centralization or decentralization?  I think one thing that's important is to recognize that centralization is, in some regard, the inevitable outcome. The question is not decentralization or centralization, but to what degree on the spectrum?  Most of us recognize that the past 15 years was excessively centralized. But let's also note that the growth in the internet came from centralized services such as AOL and Yahoo. And the growth in the mobile ecosystem was doubtlessly boosted by the iPhone and its rich vertical integration.  We see many forms of centralization. Some of that is walled gardens. But other times it's a disproportionate accumulation of data, of revenue, of R&D budgets, of talent evaluations. Another reason is that it’s purely habit and brand. Very few of us ever think to try Bing or any substitute search engine. And our habit is really powerful. Think of how much better Bing would have to be for you to choose to even try it.  I literally haven’t thought of Bing in years.  When you take a look at OpenSea, OpenSea's brand – and now some of its enforcement of fraud – makes it a more reliable marketplace, even though it's running purely on decentralized blockchain networks. This, incidentally, is one of the reasons why you'll see that these companies are still venture-backed and worth in excess of $12 billion to $15 billion.  Because even though there's no technical centralization – that is to say they're not locking in developers, users or data – some form of habits, brand, IP (intellectual property), R&D, technical, machine learning, feedback loops occur that tends to centralize. I'm hopeful that we'll see significantly less centralization and healthier competition forward in this next year.  Thanks for your time.

But that can change the bigger that stablecoin's market cap gets.  UST is now the third-biggest stablecoin on the market after Tether's USDT and Circle's USD coin (USDC), which are still significantly larger in terms of market cap. However, the native stablecoin of the Terra ecosystem has grown rapidly, from $180 million at the beginning of 2021 to over $17 billion in market capitalization as of April 18.  Terraform Labs is the organization behind the UST stablecoin and its LUNA token.  UST keeps its $1 dollar value by using a smart contract-based algorithm to keep the price of UST anchored to $1 by permanently destroying LUNA tokens in order to mint create UST tokens.  As Ardoino sees it, “If you have a liquidation [with an algorithmic stablecoin of UST's size] with this market, you can still handle that. But imagine if you have a $80 [billion] or $100 billion market cap stablecoin like tether that’s [primarily] backed by digital assets. It’s really hard to predict what will happen and [know] if there will be enough liquidity to backstop that immense cascade.”  Why is he even noticing UST considering USDT and USDC are so much bigger, at a market cap of $82 billion and $49 billion, respectively? Maybe because UST has been quickly gaining on the stablecoin leaders, growing 138-fold in 2021.  But with the rewards come risks. Researchers have noted their concerns about algorithmic stablecoins, and some in the crypto community are particularly worried about LUNA. Because of the way the Terra ecosystem is designed, strong market volatility poses a major threat to UST's peg, these researchers say.  Another concern could be that over 67% of the demand for UST comes from Anchor Protocol.  The Anchor protocol, a decentralized savings protocol based on the Terra blockchain, offers a comparably high yield of 19.5% on UST deposits. Terra must therefore maintain that yield. If it doesn’t, UST holders could rapidly try to sell their tokens. In turn, that could raise the risk that there’s not enough liquidity in the market for everyone to exit at the same time, some analysts and traders have argued.  Terra did not immediately respond to a request for comment by CoinDesk.  Read more: What Is LUNA and UST? A Guide to the Terra Ecosystem  UST is not the only stablecoin that concerns investors. Ardoino’s own company, Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin by market cap, has been the subject of questions about whether it has enough collateral to back the 1:1 dollar peg of USDT.  UST’s growth has also left some crypto traders worried about the future stability of the stablecoin and the risks it poses to the whole crypto market.

It appears that buyers are starting to return, which typically occurs during the second half of the month – a pattern observed by some analysts this year. Further, historical data suggests stocks and cryptos are entering a seasonally strong period in April and May, which could encourage short-term price rises.  Still, geopolitical and regulatory risks remain. For example, fighting between Russia and Ukraine intensified over the past weekend, which kept some investors on edge. And in crypto markets, new evidence of money laundering and hacks could trouble policymakers around the world.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  For now, some alternative cryptocurrencies outperformed bitcoin on Monday, indicating a greater appetite for risk among traders. Terra's LUNA token and Monero's XMR token were up by 8% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 2% rise in BTC over the same period.  Meanwhile, stocks wavered on Monday, while traditional safe haven assets such as gold and the U.S. dollar rose. That suggests global investors remain cautious despite short-term price jumps in speculative assets.

Bitcoin neutral despite volume uptick  Bitcoin's price bounce over the past 24 hours coincided with a small uptick in trading volume, according to CoinDesk data.  Still, buy volume and sell volume were balanced on Monday, suggesting indecision among buyers and sellers. Traders will need to keep BTC above $40,000 with higher than average volume in order to sustain the recovery phase.  So far, technical indicators are neutral. Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies, noticed a false breakout in BTC on the charts, which suggests resistance at $48,000 could stall a price bounce.  ""Long-term momentum has weakened notably, so a confirmed breakdown would increase risk, noting secondary support is near $27,200 BTC in our work,"" Stockton wrote in a Monday report.  Crypto security concerns  On April 14, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) attributed the $620 million cryptocurrency hack from Axie Infinity-linked Ronin bridge to North Korea’s hacking group Lazarus Group and APT 38.  The FBI said in a press release last Thursday: “The FBI, in coordination with Treasury and other U.S. government partners, will continue to expose and combat the DPRK’s use of illicit activities – including cybercrime and cryptocurrency theft – to generate revenue for the regime.”  “The magnitude of this one (hack) shows things have moved from small exploits to true national security concerns,” Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at blockchain research firm TRM told Business Insider. “It’s staggering - bank robbery at the speed of the internet,"" Redbord said.  According to CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De and Danny Nelson, the Treasury Department added an Ethereum address to its sanctions list on Thursday. Wallet profiler Nansen had labeled the sanctioned address as a “Ronin Bridge Exploiter” when checked by CoinDesk on April 14. It held 148,000 ETH at publication time. CoinDesk independently confirmed that the wallet is tied to the Ronin exploit.  Here is a rundown.  Hack confirmed: Crypto analytics firm Chainalysis tweeted that the address “was involved in the Ronin hack,” saying that it has received 173,600 ETH and 25.5 million USDC from the Ronin Bridge smart contract during the attack.  Record thefts: Chainalysis also released a report on April 14 demonstrating how hackers are stealing more from DeFi platforms than ever before. Tracing firm Elliptic estimated that 14% of the stolen funds had already been laundered by April 14.  Laundering continues: The sanctioned wallet appeared to “keep laundering” its stolen money on Friday even as the U.S. Department of Treasury put it on the OFAC's SDN List, according to CoinDesk's findings.

42394224,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaT9N,1650309563,The Right Tax Treatment of Staking Rewards Is Clear: Taxation Only After Sale,"Now is the time to call the question on staking taxation, and the answer is clear: Block rewards received by stakers should be taxed only upon sale.  In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service declared that virtual currency is property. In the very same policy decision (made in guidance document IRS Notice 2014-21), the agency gets it wrong on how to tax proof-of-work block rewards. It considers these new tokens immediately taxable “gross income.”  Like all federal agencies, the IRS is compelled to apply federal statute when forming its tax policies. In this case, that is the Internal Revenue Code, or “IRC.” Section 61 of that code defines what is to be considered gross income. Surprising to no one, this section doesn’t specifically address block rewards, nor do any U.S. Treasury regulations.  Bill Hughes is the senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters at ConsenSys Software. He was formerly a senior official in the Department of Justice and White House. Greg Stephens is a third year student at the University of Virginia School of Law.  The IRS had little to go on when taking a position on block reward taxation nearly a decade ago that still impacts a growing industry today. It might not deserve too much scorn for getting it wrong, but it’s time to fix the mistake.  The reason staking rewards ought to be taxable only upon sale, and not before, is clear when scrutinizing existing rules. The IRS has said little relating to cryptocurrency tokens, but affirms that virtual currencies are property and traditional property taxation principles apply.  In that context, there are really two types of property: income that’s taxable when you get it and the type that is not. Property received as payment or compensation is income and taxed based on the fair market value of the property when received.  See also: A New SEC Definition for ‘Exchanges’ Has Big Implications for Crypto | Bill Hughes  Created property  Property you purchase or create is not. Instead, for this category of assets, you are taxed on any gains you realize when you sell it.  This treatment is intuitive with respect to created property. We paint pictures, grow crops, mine raw materials, process raw materials into useful commodities, write essays and engage in countless other creative processes, knowing and expecting that, should our creations actually have some monetary value, they are not taxed unless and until we sell them.  In the world of blockchain, staking is a prerequisite to validation. Validation entails running code that verifies new transactions do not violate rules of the blockchain protocol and are consistent with its transaction history.  By running this code, validators create new tokens for themselves. The rewards that stakers create are not compensation.  A staker never receives the tokens from another person in exchange for goods or services (setting aside transaction fees, which is a topic for another day). There is no accounting ledger under the arm of some other party showing the expense of sending the staker reward tokens.  To say the protocol compensates the validator would be akin to saying the field compensates the farmer with crops or the mine compensates the miner with ore. It is nonsensical.  Staking rewards are, instead, created property. They are a product of validating transactions, just as crops are a product of a farmer’s labor. Created property has a widely applied and time-tested treatment of taxation. Created property isn’t taxed until sale.  Taxing at 'creation'  That the tax system has taken this approach is no big mystery because there is no workable alternative. Taxing assets at creation is rife with serious problems.  For instance, it may be hard if not impossible to know the fair market value of the creation at genesis. The complexity and seriousness of these problems only multiply in the context of staking rewards.  The fair market value of the rewards may not be possible to ascertain when created. A staker’s gain would likely be overstated, both due to costs associated with maintaining a stake and the effects of token dilution.  The number and timing of rewards over a calendar year, as well as having many stakes on many protocols with many different dollar-denominated token values, would make compliance with a taxing-at-creation approach nearly impossible for most taxpayers to comply with.  And where would the average taxpayer look for help? Technical differences among the protocols in how new tokens are created would be daunting to manage, requiring tax advisers to have the technical savvy outpacing many experienced blockchain developers.  See also: Why We Still Need Guidance on Staking Rewards Taxation | Opinion  Such a rule makes broad-based tax noncompliance a certainty. The IRS should favor rules that enable tax compliance. Indeed, they proclaim “our job at the IRS is to help taxpayers.”  Taxing at sale  Taxing staking rewards at sale is the most sensible approach because it is easier to comply with, easier to police and fairer because gains can be more reliably set off by actual costs. It also requires us to apply existing law as we are used to applying it.  Taxing staking rewards only after sale avoids discriminatory tax treatment in relation to other forms of created property. The societal and economic costs of wrong or unclear policy includes staking migrating en masse to overseas jurisdictions that have codified more reasonable tax treatment.  That’s bad for the U.S. in many respects – including in terms of tax revenue, serving as a hotbed of innovation and as an economy that values everyday people improving their lot through their diligence and ingenuity.  Time is of the essence for the IRS to get this right, and for Congress to take a more active interest in this precise question.  Ethereum, the most-used blockchain, will migrate fully to proof-of-stake later this year, and it is expected that hundreds of thousands (and rising) of validators will be supporting the network. U.S. taxpayers control many of those validators, and they deserve certainty and fairness with respect to tax treatment of their rewards. Validators on other consensus networks deserve fair tax treatment, too.  See also: What's at Stake as Josh Jarrett Sues the IRS | Opinion  Moreover, as the community of taxpayers creating virtual currency property becomes more significant, the number of impacted taxpayers rises commensurately. To date, the IRS has not faced a significant volume of challenges to taxation of block rewards, but the case litigated by the Jarretts should make the IRS think twice.  If the IRS thinks crypto is generally property, then the solution here is straightforward. At the very least, if the IRS believes staking rewards are compensation and not newly created property, then it must state unequivocally who is doing the compensating and how one accurately accounts for the gain realized.  Hand-wringing about virtual currencies and taxation noncompliance is overdone. An overwhelming number of stakers seek to pay exactly what they owe. Updated and clear guidance that delivers fair and consistent tax treatment will better enable that outcome.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,"Bill Hughes, Greg Stephens",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/04/18/the-right-tax-treatment-of-staking-rewards-is-clear-taxation-only-after-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92a8395d2ee254be1724b8988e18f1881cad59b9-2048x1364.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394225,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaTJd,1650309227,Moonbird NFTs Are a Bet on Kevin Rose's Rep,"In crypto, being “early” is everything.  Investors repeat it like a mantra: “We’re still early,” or, “It’s so early,” the idea being that it’s far from “too late” to get in on the crypto gold rush. You can see it in Twitter posts and subway advertisements, hear it in podcasts and pitch decks. The promise of early adoption is that you, too, can be ahead of the curve. Buying in now can feel like owning a piece of on-chain history, something that’s bound to appreciate once everyone else catches on.  And while the ethos of the “early” meme is mainly about price appreciation, it’s also about reputation. It’s those first investors – the ones who bet it all on new, unproven ideas and came out with unfathomable riches – whose example we’re meant to follow.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Enter Kevin Rose, co-founder of the news aggregator Digg. The site brought him a decent amount of press in the late aughts: in 2006, a Businessweek cover story declared him the leader of a “new brat pack of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.” Digg eventually imploded and was sold to the startup incubator Betaworks for almost nothing. Rose went on to found a couple other internet companies, but for the past decade he’s mostly been an investor.  Now a partner at True Ventures, he works with companies in crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), where his status as an “early” internet entrepreneur has given him a real reputational head start. Never mind the fact that he once uploaded a video of himself throwing a live raccoon down a set of stairs – the crypto community remains decently confident in Rose’s ability to pick winners.  That confidence was on full display this past weekend when a new NFT project called Moonbirds made its public debut. The tokens – 10,000 pixelated images of owls – initially sold for 2.5 ether (ETH) each, and are already being traded for tens of thousands of dollars. As of this morning, the cheapest Moonbirds will cost you around 20 ETH, or $58,000.  Rose was “early” with Digg – Moonbirds’ backers seem to think he’s still got some of that intuition.  It’s one of the clearest examples to date of the way in which crypto can assign a monetary value to reputation and social clout.  The collection is also the product of an online social club called Proof Collective. Rose and two other crypto investors, Ryan Carson and Justin Mezzell, founded Proof Collective late last year as a way to monetize the community around Rose’s crypto podcast. It now bills Moonbirds as the “official PFP [profile picture]” of the group, a way for adherents to express their allegiance online.  In a short video message on Saturday, Rose said the Moonbirds sale made $58 million for an entity called Proof Holdings Inc. – money he sees as a “capital raise” for Proof Collective. (Per the Moonbirds FAQ, Proof Holdings is backed by True Ventures.)  Membership in Proof Collective is limited to 1,000 slots, and guaranteed through a separate collection of 1,000 NFTs (they debuted at 1 ETH each and now go for an eye-popping 98 ETH – $285,000).  It’s essentially the Bored Ape Yacht Club playbook: NFT ownership makes you a part of the community, which gets you special perks and early access to new crypto projects down the line (ka-ching!).  Read More: Can Crypto Put a Price on Community? | Opinion  Moonbirds are also built around a special investment mechanism, whereby holders can effectively lock up their tokens in exchange for additional perks. Proof calls this process “nesting,” and claims it will incentivize long-term holding as opposed to day trading and flipping.  Crucially, though, there has been less talk around what Proof actually intends to build beyond the VIP social club framework it's already established. Proof has promoted a few NFTs in the past and runs a small Discord server, but its plans for future projects still lack specificity. Among those plans, so far: a series of real-life community meetups and a dedicated metaverse platform called “Project Highrise.”  ""We like to under-promise and over-deliver,” Moonbird's website reads, perhaps a tacit admission that they're building on the fly.  Proof has only been around for a few months and has gained about 1,000 members (many members own multiple NFT passes). The fact that it managed to raise $58 million in an unstable market speaks to that sense of trust in Rose. (And also, perhaps, to an element of mercenary opportunism.)  Read More: Moonbirds Fly on Debut, Clocking $200M in Sales  At least one prominent Twitter account has alleged that Proof members may be “wash trading” their NFTs – selling them back and forth between wallets controlled by the same trader, in an effort to pump up prices – but traders don’t seem fazed. Yes, Kevin Rose once threw a wild racoon several feet in the air; yes, he has experienced his fair share of business failures but he also seems to know where the money is. At least, that’s what the market appears to have decided.  It speaks to a larger dynamic around buzzy NFT projects and token launches, many of which operate around similar cults of personality. The success of Gary Vaynerchuk’s NFT collection, VeeFriends, has a lot to do with the fact that Gary Vaynerchuk is who he is. Same goes for the MyBFF collection, founded by the entrepreneur and investor Jaime Schmidt (she sold a startup to Unilever in 2017, and now runs a VC firm with her partner Chris Cantino).  In an industry rife with anonymous traders, projects tied to famous investors often have a leg up. And connections in the VC world probably don’t hurt either.

Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Show High Value Suggesting Whale Activity As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC exchange outflows have registered a large spike recently. The &apos;exchange outflows&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin currently exiting wallets of all exchanges. When the value of this indicator is high, it means investors are withdrawing a large amount of coins at the moment. Especially large values can imply whales have been buying. Such a trend, when sustained, may be bullish for the price of the coin as investors usually transfer their crypto out of exchanges for accumulation purposes. On the other hand, low outflow values suggest there isn&apos;t much buying going in the market right now. This could either be neutral for the price, or if selling is going on, then it may be bearish.

42394221,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaSz7,1650305675,"Ethereum’s Dark Underbelly Shows That Even in Crypto, Trust Matters","When it was released last month, “The Cryptopians” caught some buzz for a handful of juicy revelations about behind-the-scenes conflict during the development and launch of Ethereum. But the book, written by longtime crypto reporter and podcaster Laura Shin, has a lot more to offer than dirty laundry. It may be the best book about the crypto industry by a journalist so far.  I say that with apologies to Jeff Roberts, whose “Kings of Crypto” is similarly excellent and arguably written with a bit more outward verve. Shin takes it by a nose simply because her iconoclastic subjects keep your attention better than a corporate cipher like Brian Armstrong. And while the book is written in an understated tone, that serves Shin’s absolutely incredible reporting effort: She’s uncovered so many shocking, intriguing and surprising new details about the early history of Ethereum that there’s no need for extra mustard.  Those details, it should be said, will for now mostly interest crypto insiders or other business types looking for deeper insights into specific people or organizations. The book also offers a rich window on the realities of running a project structured along the loose, arguably democratic lines that many crypto projects aspire to. The book offers a functional introduction to what Ethereum is, what it can do and why it might matter, but that’s not the main focus. Those just starting their crypto journey should probably look elsewhere.  But for those with a knowledge base in place, the book will deepen your technical understanding of Ethereum and blockchains through endless real-world examples. Shin’s attention to detail is ferocious, and her accounts of specific incidents include things like long lists of transactions between specific addresses. Her descriptions of especially arcane events, such as the effort to recover The DAO’s funds or unlock the infamously lost Parity funds, will help focus your basic comprehension into true understanding.  They also occasionally make the book ever so slightly a slog, and I did find myself skipping past some of the more granular sections. But that detail also ensures that “The Cryptopians” will be a vital point of reference for years, possibly decades, to come.  And now, the juicy bits  The team that coalesced around Vitalik Buterin after he introduced the Ethereum concept clearly got the job done, but they were just as clearly a bowl of mixed nuts. Shin gives rich and nuanced pictures of effectively all of the Ethereum co-founders, and the word “spectrum” is apt in a couple of senses.  At one end of that spectrum is Amir Chetrit, who got bounced early because the rest of the team didn’t think he was doing enough work. Anthony Di Iorio emerges somewhat scuffed, seemingly regarded by the other Ethereans as too focused on profit and control. At the other end are Joe Lubin and, above all, Vitalik Buterin himself, who consistently come across as thoughtful and levelheaded, and the only two Ethereum co-founders who appear to remain close today.  It must be acknowledged, however, that it seems they were also the two who were most available to Shin: Some of the book’s most damning assessments of the various players appear to come from Buterin, even when he’s not quoted directly. That being said, Shin is clearly an independent thinker, and doesn’t hesitate to put Lubin or Buterin in the dunk tank when it’s their turn. While it’s a truth constantly evaded by bad actors of all stripes, people with less to hide simply have more leverage for defining their own narrative than those trapped in a web of lies and delusions.  And boy, the lies and delusions.  “The Cryptopians” puts real substance behind the crypto community’s longstanding antipathy for Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IOHK and founder of Cardano and Ethereum who was voted out of the Ethereum founding team at the same time as Chetrit. Hoskinson is convincingly depicted as a liar and manipulator of staggering boldness, bordering on sociopathy. This has allegedly included various false claims about his education and, according to Shin’s sources including Joe Lubin himself, claiming to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. In crypto, sins don’t come much more cardinal than that one.  (By way of disclosure, I’ve had my own unpleasant brushes with Hoskinson: After I wrote a 2018 profile and interview focused on his various clashes (unfortunately now offline), he recorded a lengthy YouTube video warning the rest of the crypto community that I was a bad journalist and not to talk to me.  Being attacked by Hoskinson has had, if anything, a positive impact on my career. I highly recommend the experience.)  The book does have something of a secondary villain, former Ethereum Foundation head Ming Chan. The book spends a lot of time recounting her immense self-regard, apparent emotional instability and what occasionally looks like scheming for power. Some of the book’s most tense moments come when the Ethereum Foundation team reach the end of their rope and move to replace her.  Shin makes the counterintuitive but obviously correct decision to write about this craziness with a deadpan tone and meticulous attention to detail. A lesser writer (myself, for instance) would have had a hard time resisting taking egotistical pot shots at the various clownish figures and embarrassing behaviors sprinkled throughout.  A favorite example comes late in the book when Lubin’s ConsenSys buys the asteroid mining company Planetary Resources, at the height of the 2017-2018 crypto mania. Lubin at the time issued a laughable statement about how important “deep space capabilities” were to his cryptocurrency company.  Shin, with the discipline of an endurance athlete refusing a single delicious M&M, simply lets the self-evident absurdity stand without comment.  People always matter  Ming and Hoskinson, according to Shin’s reporting, were detrimental to Ethereum in fairly subtle ways, mostly emotional. Ming was an occasional roadblock or hassle, but by Shin’s telling she also did a lot of vital work. Hoskinson was out before the bulk of real work even began.  But their stories, along with the dozens of smaller conflicts and blowups chronicled in “The Cryptopians,” nonetheless drive home an important broader takeaway. In crypto, “trustlessness” is a technological term of art that has been widely misperceived as some sort of moral carte blanche, a sense that anything goes because blockchain somehow protects you from bad actors. It has even cropped up in the bizarre viewpoint that it’s okay if known criminals are running your project.  But the truth is that in crypto development and investment, people arguably matter more than in more formal or traditional settings. Open leadership structures leave bigger gaps for people with Machiavellian personalities to sow distrust or put their own interests ahead of the project’s. In developing fields, there’s far more leeway for individuals to pitch bad ideas to underinformed and greedy audiences, proactively fudging the line between failure and fraud.  Those technological bells and whistles, jangling on a yard-long line of horse pucky spun by someone who insists he nearly graduated from MIT, are often an intentional misdirection. Understanding the technical or financial claims being made by a new project is often less important than understanding the people behind it, their character, their past behavior and their present motivations.  There’s no better example of this than Buterin himself. He’s often hailed as a technical or systems genius, but what’s less often noted is his apparently strong moral and intellectual center. The key conflict in Ethereum’s history was the decision over whether to organize the projects on for-profit or nonprofit terms. Buterin was the most influential single person in that conversation, and his insistence on the nonprofit setup contributed to the alienation of Di Iorio in particular.  Buterin broadly believed the nonprofit setup was important because it aligned with the crypto and cypherpunk values of open protocols and public infrastructure. It’s too much to say that has been a crucial decision for cryptocurrency in general – the nonprofit structure pioneered by Ethereum has been abused at least as often as it has served to make projects more public-spirited.  More important is what it says about Buterin himself, and ultimately about Ethereum’s incredible success. His early insistence on a degree of selfless public-spiritedness has made Ethereum a comfortable home for all sorts of outside-the-box thinkers, people genuinely interested in much more than just money. And here’s the kicker – as it turns out, generosity is wealth-creating. It’s secretly true everywhere, but especially true in crypto.  That’s seemingly a hard lesson to absorb, even for full-grown adults. In a space where bitcoiners constantly bang on about “low time preference,” the reality is that most projects have extremely short-term viewpoints. Scammers are the most obvious examples, but you can also include trade-offs made to compromise security for throughput, or really any project where profit crowds out other priorities.  As those projects come and go, reaching or missing their confined, self-interested little metrics, Ethereum is still here. To a degree that’s rarely acknowledged, that’s because Buterin, even in the very early days, insisted on principles of openness, accessibility and fairness. Moreover, it seems clear he understood his power and didn’t hesitate to flex it (in his understated way) toward those unselfish goals.  That’s a truly remarkable set of ethical choices for someone who was not even old enough to drink in the U.S. when he started Ethereum. It’s far more impressive than how many languages he speaks or his command of crypto economics and incentive design.  I’m no fan of the great man theory of history, but in this case, I might be ready to make an exception.",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,David Z.

A high volume close above $1.12 may be the foundation for another leg up, supportive of buyers. What to Expect from FTM? Fantom is a well-developed DeFi protocol and one of the top performers year-to-date. Nonetheless, FTM is under pressure, sliding 68 percent from 2022 lows.

Key technical points: The RSI indicator shows a bearish divergence. The LUNA coin price sustains above the 100-day EMA. Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of Terra is $2.34 Billion, marking a 190% rise. Past Performance of LUNA LUNA coin price fell by 34% within a fortnight after forming a morning star pattern near the $120 level. The downfall cracks under multiple support levels and the 50 and 100-day EMAs before finding support at the $75 mark.

Source-Tradingview LUNA Technical Analysis LUNA coin price action forms a bullish engulfing candlestick after a short-period downfall from the $120 mark. Hence, the possibilities are inclined to a trend reversal teasing a potential price jump in the upcoming week. The crucial daily EMAs (50, 100, and 200) maintain a bullish alignment as the price resurfaces above the 100-day EMA. However, the minor retracement in the 50-day EMA can provide resistance to the reversing trend.

""After careful consideration and evaluation of the company structure, we arrived at a conclusion that serving Russian and Belarusian clients will prevent us from maximizing our strengths and performing better. In this current climate, which is highly uncertain, we must prioritize our adaptability by following a more rigid strategy,"" the blog post reads.  The announcement goes on to say that EXMO ""decided to sell the digital assets business in Russia and Belarus.""  EXMO is also giving up its users in Kazakhstan since the new owner is based there. The structure of the deal is unclear, as EXMO hadn't been operating as a separate legal entity in Russia. Maria Stankevich, EXMO's chief business development officer, told CoinDesk that what's being sold is ""around a million users, software, intellectual property and [much] more.""  A Kazakhstan-based EXMO RBK LTD. will pick up serving the users in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, according to the announcement, on a separate website, EXMO.me. At this point, the interface of EXMO.me fully replicates that of EXMO.com.  The buyer, whose name EXMO didn't disclose, is ""a Russian-based software development company, which was one of the vendors to provide engineering services to EXMO during the last three years,"" according to the blog post.  EXMO will stop on-boarding new users in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Russian ruble trading pairs were disabled on EXMO.com on Apr., 15, the company said.  In addition, Edward Bark, one of EXMO's founders with Russian citizenship, is leaving the company and transferring his stake to Serhii Zhdanov, EXMO.com's current CEO. Bark used to own 37.51% of the company, and so now Zhdanov owns a share that is ""slightly"" bigger than other shareholders, Zhdanov said. (EXMO Group operates several legal entities in Europe and the U.S., each with its own set of shareholders.)  Difficult decision  The decision was tough, ""however, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, EXMO.com as a global group wishes to avoid risking our global expansion plans by operating in such high risk markets,"" the blog post reads.  EXMO'sexpansion plans include securing a distributed ledger technology provider license in Gibraltar, as well as Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) authorization in the U.K. and money service business (MSB) licenses in 40 states in the U.S., Zhdanov told CoinDesk.  ""By the international standards of assessing risks, Ukraine is less risky for us than Russia,"" Stankevich said.  EXMO isn't the first crypto exchange to distance itself from Russia since the war began. Since February, several cryptocurrency platforms have followed the lead of mainstream companies such as Visa, Mastercard, Western Union and others. They include crypto exchanges Binance, which stopped accepting payments via Russian bank cards; CEX.io, which suspended deposits and withdrawals for Russian and Belarusian users; and CoinZoom, which paused registration of new accounts from Russia.

The collection of 10,000 PFPs (profile pics) has racked up 69,000 ETH (roughly $207 million) in total sales, boasting a floor price of 21.3 ETH (roughly $64,000) at the time of writing.  The debut put Moonbirds on top of OpenSea’s volume leaderboard not just for the week, but for the last 30 days, ahead of Azuki (50,000 ETH) and Bored Ape Yacht Club (35,000 ETH).  The historic hype for owl pictures came with some precedence – the project is the first from PROOF Collective, a private NFT community led by entrepreneurs Kevin Rose and Ryan Carson.  The group has marketed Moonbirds as “the official PROOF PFP,” with holders of the PROOF Collective membership pass (the cheapest currently listed at 99 ETH) being granted early minting privileges.  Controversy  The project’s mint came with some controversy, from complaints of a hefty 2.5 ETH (roughly $7,500) mint price to raffle manipulation and concerns of rarity sniping (project leaders buying up rare editions using insider knowledge) by its developers.  More generally, the project’s meteoric rise comes in contrast with an otherwise downtrodden NFT market, in which many top projects have seen a lull or sharp drop in sales over the past few weeks.  Moonbirds' road map  Moonbirds' holders are given access to “Moonbird-related drops, Parliament meetups and IRL events” as well as the private PROOF Discord channel, according to the project’s website.

Economists say this might make certain commodities or products more expensive on a regional basis, pushing up consumer prices at a time when U.S. inflation is already running at a four-decade high.  Bitcoin is seen by some investors as a hedge against inflation, so traders might see deglobalization as a fresh reason to bet on the largest cryptocurrency by market value.  What is deglobalization?  In the past few decades the trend toward globalization ushered in an era of governments and corporations promoting free trade and greater offshoring of labor. A relevant economic principle is “comparative advantage” – the idea that a country might be able to produce goods and services cheaper than its trading partners.  As a result, people enjoyed lower costs of imports.  More recently, however, the trend appears to have reversed, prompting some pundits to predict a new era of deglobalization. The trend started several years ago when the U.S.-China trade war broke out, worsened with the global coronavirus pandemic and recently pushed into a new level with the Russia-Ukraine war.  Global supply chains have been disrupted, exports have been choked off in some cases and now, due to the U.S. financial sanctions, Russia is cut off from the dollar-dominated global payments system.  ""Russia’s invasion will have direct impacts on the global economy due to the contraction of Ukrainian and Russian exports, particularly energy, food, fertilizer and other commodities,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a speech on April 13. “When Russia made the decision to invade Ukraine, it predestined an exit from the global financial system. Russian leaders knew that we would impose severe sanctions.""  What would be the economic impact of deglobalization?  As global trade in many goods and commodities gets disrupted further, end-product prices could rise and contribute to inflation.  “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is causing shortages of oil and gas, wheat, nickel, neon and all sorts of other goods,” Erica Groshen, a former Federal Reserve Bank of New York researcher who's now senior economics adviser at the Cornell University school of industrial and labor relations, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Those kinds of shortages lead to price spikes, and at the same time we have supply issues that were from the pandemic.”  Deglobalization also creates uncertainty, which has a depressing effect on economic activity, Groshen said.  Despite the U.S. Federal Reserve’s newly hawkish stance – fighting inflation by raising interest rates and potentially shrinking the size of its balance sheet – it's unlikely that higher prices will go away soon.  “Long-term inflationary forces are building,” the Wall Street Journal columnist James Mackintosh wrote on May 5.  The increasing fragmentation could also shake up the U.S. dollar's dominance in global commerce.  “The dollar would remain the major global currency even in that landscape, but fragmentation at a smaller level is certainly quite possible,” Gita Gopinath, the International Monetary Fund’s first deputy managing director, said in an interview with the Financial Times’ Jonathan Wheatley and Colby Smith. “We are already seeing that with some countries renegotiating the currency in which they get paid for trade.”  U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said March 30 that the U.S. must shift the focus to rebuilding domestic manufacturing industries and lessening ties with “unfriendly” economies, according to the Wall Street Journal. Presumably those domestic costs would be higher in the short term.  “The problem that we are confronted with today – after two years of [COVID-19] and also Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – is that this version of globalization that we are living in has not taken us to a place where we feel more secure,” Tai said, “We are feeling increasing senses of insecurity in terms of our supply chains, and our reliance on partners who (sic) we aren’t comfortable relying on.”  Says Larry Fink, founder of BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset management firm, in his annual investor letter: ""While dependence on Russian energy is in the spotlight, companies and governments will also be looking more broadly at their dependencies on other nations.""  ""This may lead companies to onshore or nearshore more of their operations, resulting in a faster pullback from some countries,"" Fink said. ""A large-scale reorientation of supply chains will inherently be inflationary.""  What would be the impact on bitcoin's price?  Many analysts say bitcoin can serve as an inflation hedge, like gold. So the current inflationary economic environment is a testing ground.  On the one hand, higher consumer prices – or, flipped around, any increases represent a reduction in the dollar's purchasing power – could strengthen bitcoin's appeal because the cryptocurrency's ultimate supply is fixed. Some investors argue that bitcoin is ""harder"" money than the dollar because the Federal Reserve can always print more dollars.  On the other hand, the Fed also might move to tamp down inflation by tightening monetary policy, which could crimp economic growth and put downward pressure on stock prices and, lately, bitcoin has been unusually correlated with stocks. The last time the U.S. saw inflation at the current, elevated levels was in the early 1980s, and the Fed, then led by Paul Volcker, raised the benchmark interest rate to nearly 20%.  “How the price of bitcoin performs in an inflationary environment is untested,” said Garrick Hileman, blockchain technology researcher at London School of Economics and Political Science. “We don't have thousands of years in history like we have with gold to look back on. This is the first time bitcoin [has] ever gone into a kind of broad inflationary cycle.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Angelique Chen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/18/what-would-deglobalization-mean-for-bitcoins-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7646e9e928da30b09db4b5cc2211c27b3aaee0ec-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423517,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aWLh,1650298869,"Crypto Proponents Fear SEC 'Backdoor' Regulations on Exchanges, Dealers","Two recent, highly technical proposals could solidify the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) grasp on the U.S. crypto market, leading the industry to take another stand against what it sees as the wrong approach to government oversight.  Chairman Gary Gensler has argued the SEC should be the lead regulator of the crypto world because of its role as the top cop for the U.S. securities markets. But lobbyists and lawyers for digital assets firms and their trade groups oppose a February proposal they believe may expand how the SEC defines ""regulated exchanges"" in such a way that it encompasses a wide swath of crypto platforms. In the meantime, the SEC announced another proposal that seems to follow the same pattern: potential oversight of the crypto industry without making that intention explicitly clear.  For the initial rule proposal, which would reset the SEC’s regulations for so-called alternative trading systems and expand the definition for what makes an exchange, the agency set a brief, 30-day window that closes Monday. The crypto industry’s growing Washington, D.C., contingent is arguing this February policy would be a harmful overreach into interactions between people rather than just their transactions and – as it stands – it’s too opaque for crypto businesses to know where they may run afoul of the agency.  “We think that there’s a potential threat to the industry if this rule were enacted,” said Sarah Milby, a senior policy manager for the Blockchain Association in Washington, arguing the proposal is bad policy that crypto firms see as a “backdoor route to regulation.” She said the agency should be “more forthright” in the rules it’s developing.  The SEC did not respond to a request for comment.  “The central question this proposal raises is whether the SEC can and should regulate platforms where buyers and sellers only talk about trading,” said Bill Hughes, senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters at ConsenSys, who also criticized the way the agency seems to be approaching the industry.  Hughes helped draft ConsenSys’s comment letter on the proposal, which was published Monday.  “There is no mention of crypto, blockchain or [decentralized finance] in the 654 pages of the rule, but whether this proposal applies to crypto is very much an open question given how broadly it is written,” Hughes said. “That sort of transparency is precisely what the federal rule-making procedures are intended to provide.”  'Retail investors'  However, in recent remarks Gensler suggested that alternative trading platforms are more typically used by institutional investors, not the individuals more likely to be involved in crypto trading. Gensler said he told his staff to weigh whether investor protections “on exchanges with which retail investors interact should apply to crypto platforms.”  That’s signaling he’s thinking of crypto platforms as national securities exchanges, according to a recent note from law firm Sidley Austin.  Whatever category the SEC eventually decides is right for digital assets firms, Gensler said it’s almost certain his agency will have a say because, “with so many tokens trading, the probability is quite remote that any given platform has zero securities.”  The second, more recent rule, proposed March 28, would redefine what it means to be a securities dealer, including people and businesses using automated and algorithmic technology to execute trades. Unlike the first proposal, this one did nod toward the industry once, saying in its 36th footnote that, yes, the SEC had its eye on “any digital asset that is a security.”  “This follows very quickly on the heels of the [alternative trading systems] rule,” Milby said, which she argued makes it seem as if “the SEC is hastily trying to make regulations without fully understanding the effects and costs of those potential rules.”  Bill Hughes said he expects the industry will take the agency to court if a final version of the exchanges rule looks much the same as the proposal. Legal challenges have sometimes been successful in reversing policy efforts from the securities watchdog.  “These rule changes have the potential to capture a vast array of new technologies, and the persons who develop and advance those technologies,” said Michelle Bond, the chief executive officer for the Association for Digital Asset Markets in Washington. “This has the potential to chill further development in the United States of digital asset technologies.”  Key Republican lawmakers have also criticized the proposed rules.  ""The rule makings fail to define the SEC’s statutory authority,"" Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina – the ranking Republican on the House Financial Services Committee – and Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) wrote to the SEC. They argued the regulator ""fails to identify the problem that the rulemakings are intended to solve, particularly as it relates to requiring certain market participants facilitating digital asset transactions to register with the SEC.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/18/crypto-proponents-fear-sec-backdoor-regulations-on-exchanges-dealers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a187e885e4cbfbea23c7d77d80232f2da7463e87-4000x2979.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A new protocol doesn’t hang around for a big-time data company to integrate its API into its feed, meaning there’s demand for a data provider that can produce insights about current market trends on the fly.  Dune Analytics, a site that lets anyone publish and access crypto dashboards driven by blockchain data, has filled that gap. The 3-year-old company, which in February 2022 raised $69,420,000 in a Series B funding round, lets you query blockchain data for free.  Like most crypto protocols, the source of Dune’s power is its community. Popular dashboards created by its users track anything and everything, with queries as diverse as trending yield farms on Ethereum and the non-fungible token (NFT) collections bought by top OpenSea traders.  Read more: What Is Yield Farming?  Of course, specialist data sites like Nansen also publish similar insights, but the advantage of Dune is that it’s free. It’s also very easy to spin up one of their dashboards and publish your own datasets or view the work produced by others at no additional cost.  Dune is particularly useful when you want to find the answer to a niche question that has fallen through the cracks of other data services. One popular dashboard, for instance, queries Ethereum Name System domain names with five letters, then sorts them by expiry dates.  Another sifts through blockchain data produced by MakerDAO, the protocol that powers the decentralized U.S. dollar stablecoin, DAI, to trace the flow of the money.  How do you use Dune Analytics?  To view blockchain data, head to dune.xyz.  You can view popular dashboards through the “discover” button or hunt for specific data in the search bar. Data could be presented as lists or visualized into bar charts and graphs. Most queries are sorted into dashboards – groups of queries presented on a single screen.  There are limitations to the data you can find. As of April 2022, Dune supports Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Optimism and Gnosis Chain. It also supports any smart contract created on those blockchains.  To view a dashboard, simply click on it. Dune doesn’t store the blockchain’s state data itself – it just displays the data produced by the Structured Query Language (SQL) query the last time that someone requested data.  Read more: How to Use DeFi Data to Make Smarter Investment Decisions  All queries are refreshed whenever you view them. However, refreshing can take a while – you’ll be added to a queue. As a result, your data might be a couple of minutes or hours out of date.  You can also create queries by hitting “new query” and entering SQL code. Remember that Dune data is only as reliable as the coder who created the query.  Dune Analytics offers a paid service, too. As of April 2022, it costs $390 a month. The premium version lets you skip the query queue and run parallel queries, meaning that your analytics can be processed faster than they are for non-paid users, keep dashboards and queries private, and export your data to comma-separated values (CSV) files.  Who created Dune Analytics?  Dune Analytics was created in March 2019 by two founders from Oslo, Norway: Fredrik Haga and Mats Olsen.  Haga’s background is suitably esoteric for a tech unicorn: He’s an economics graduate from elite universities in Australia and the U.S., and loves hip hop and freestyle skiing. Olsen studied in Norway, and after graduation stuck to software engineering and data science.  The pair built smart contracts together at a Norwegian media company, but quit once they realized the corporation was too large to take a serious bet on crypto. “Over a beer that summer Mats told me ‘I quit my job yesterday.’ It then took me about half a second to realize I would have to do the same,” wrote Haga in a blog post. Shortly after, they created Dune.  The company set out to work on Ethereum data first of all, but it was a small shop, and for months they only had a handful of paying customers. The duo struggled to get funding for months until Binance took a chance on them, and invited them into their accelerator.  A seed round of $2 million came over a year later in August 2020. When “DeFi Summer,” the few months that followed the yield farming craze, was in full swing in 2020, Dune Analytics became popular with those eking out crazy percentage yields on experimental finance protocols.  Since then, Dune has grown and grown. Now it counts top crypto companies and protocols, such as Argent, Uniswap, Compound, Messari and ConsenSys, among its many customers.  Dune plans to use its $69 million Series B to keep on growing, and “educate, reward and empower a new generation of on-chain analysts.”",POSITIVE,BNB | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB | DAI,Robert Stevens,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-dune-analytics-and-how-does-it-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/412c75f43bfb23d05dd4c939744696ea5bd7bf67-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422835,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qLvh,1650295790,France's Crypto Industry Fights Institutional Caution,"To visit Paris Blockchain Week is to see the contradictions faced by those attempting to grow France’s crypto sector.  Modish purple-and-pink lighting rigs shine alongside the ornate painted ceilings of the city’s former stock exchange as attendees in hoodies slump on beanbags next to 17th century tapestries originally intended for the king’s palace at Versailles.  Web 3 seems to be having just as hard a time fitting into France’s cautious political and financial institutions – though some are optimistic that is about to change.  The mood at the Paris summit was buoyed right from the get-go when Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao reconfirmed his commitment to invest 100 million euros ($108 million) in the country, including a partnership with local incubator Station F.  That announcement was a “good signal,” French lawmaker Pierre Person told CoinDesk, saying that the country could soon become a local hub for what he calls the “Google of crypto.”  But Person, about to leave his five-year term at France’s National Assembly, also warns there’s a long way for the country to go if it’s going to avoid missing out on the next round of digital innovation as it largely did with Web 2.  His greatest ire is for EU lawmakers in Brussels, who he said are in the middle of an “act of folly” in passing controversial regulations to prevent crypto money laundering and license stablecoins. If they don’t get it right, the next six months could prove “fatal for the internet” in Europe, he said.  Read more: EU’s Crypto Activism Gets Mixed Reception at Paris Blockchain Week  But Person also sees a conservatism in the traditional financial sector, which he reckons simply uses the lack of regulation as an excuse to not bother doing any due diligence on a sector which he is convinced will transform society.  “The banks say ‘we don’t want to open a bank account for a startup which does brokerage or crypto-fiat conversions because we don’t have the rules or the framework,’” he told CoinDesk in an interview.  “That’s totally false,” he said. “They just don’t want to trouble themselves to figure out how Coinanalysis or Scorechain work,” citing two companies that can allow users to spot financial and regulatory crypto risks.  Banks like BNP Paribas or Société Générale “just don’t want to adapt themselves … but these young people won’t wait” for them to do so, he warned.  That skepticism about the conventional financial sector is shared by Viktor Fischer, managing partner at the Rockaway’s Blockchain Fund.  He has around $123 million to splurge on the sector, of which half goes into Europe, but he acknowledges there is a major task in educating easily frightened investors.  “I could never speak about bitcoin” while seeking financial support, he told CoinDesk in an interview. “Often when I was fundraising, if I used the word bitcoin in the meeting, it was over.”  Unlike U.S. pension and endowment funds, Europeans aren’t ready to dedicate a portion of their assets to the technologies that are perceived as a higher risk, which he blames on their mindset.  “If you're pessimistic, you sound smart; if you're optimistic, you make money,” he said, citing an oft-quoted dictum of the startup world. “Europeans are very good at being pessimistic.”  Reputation  The complaint that Web 3 is undermined by a negative reputation was heard repeatedly in Paris.  “We’re still debunking many of these myths ... [such as] that this stuff was just a giant Ponzi scheme,” Nicolas Cary, co-founder and vice-chair of blockchain.com, said during an on-stage interview, shortly before calling on “every single person in this room … to help five other people get into crypto.”  Yet the sector, once dominated by full-time specialists, is starting to change, with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) offering a wider appeal to Paris Blockchain Week, the summit’s co-host Michael Amar told CoinDesk.  “To be honest, if you're not in tech or law or finance, it's hard to really get into the crypto space,” he said. “With NFTs, you're talking emotions, marketing, branding: everyone.”  He believes that France’s talent pool and existing economy, with strengths in the arts and high-end companies like Louis Vuitton and Kering, make it well-placed to capitalize.  “We have amazing engineers … they're much more entrepreneurial: They take more risk,” he said. “NFT is really good for luxury; we have an amazing luxury ecosystem.”  But he acknowledges that there have been problems for French companies finding the funding that could let them exit their startup phase – and, as it stands, 70,000 French innovators have fled the country for Silicon Valley.  Read more: France's Presidential Candidates Ignore Crypto Issues  But a clutch of as many as 20 unicorn successes alongside deals that “might be a bit cheaper than the U.S.” was now starting to tempt financiers back, he said.  Sometimes that financing comes from an unlikely source – not private sector banking or venture capital giants, but the French state.  Bpifrance, an investment bank mainly funded by taxpayers’ money, “took its time” to decide to invest in the world of blockchain, Pascal Gauthier of French crypto hardware specialist Ledger previously told CoinDesk.  But now they need no convincing, Bpifrance’s Managing Director for Investment and Development Yoann Caujolle said in an interview.  “Technology is in our DNA,” he said, citing hundreds of millions of euros invested last year into tech startups, and 1 billion into other tech funds. “If we decided to expand [in Web 3 investment] it’s because top management is totally convinced.”  “We were probably one of the first institutional investors to invest in the theme” of Web 3 technology, he said, saying Bpifrance was “maybe a bit more agile” than classic banks or sovereign funds.  Investing in decentralized architectures has its own set of logistical questions, like how to divest from something that isn’t even a legal entity – but the attractive returns and range of real-world applications mean it’s worth it, he said.  “We don’t invest in bitcoin: We invest in projects and products with a business model that uses this decentralized technology,” he said. “We are past the time where people say it’s a pure scam.”  He cites investments in Lightning-focused bitcoin startup Acinq and Arianee, an Ethereum-based project for tracking the provenance of luxury brands, such as high-end watches and handbags, using blockchain-based watermarks, but to offer new after-sales services if watches or handbags change hands.  And he is, in his own words, “chauvinistic” about what France can achieve in this space.  “We have all the pieces of the jigsaw that are on the table,” he said, citing capital, talent and pro-innovation regulations. “There’s an alignment of planets which we’ve never had.”  Editor's note: Some comments have been translated from French.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/18/frances-crypto-industry-fights-institutional-caution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de96e0b4bac691d0f6e5ad67d1ae84789be5acd7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423525,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aWbh,1650289081,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin's Exchange Balance Hits 3.5-Year Low,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin dips below $39,000 as bearish macroeconomic factors continue to overshadow bullish blockchain metrics.  Featured Story: Is bitcoin an aspirational store of value?  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Morgen Rochard, managing member, Origin Wealth Advisers  Austin Reid, chief of staff, FalconX  Jake Rapaport, head of digital asset index research, Nasdaq  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  With each passing week, bitcoin's blockchain metrics diverge from bearish macroeconomic factors, offering hope to long-term holders.  The number of coins held on exchanges declined by more than 20,000 BTC to 2,449,785 BTC last week, hitting the lowest since August 2018, data provided by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows. The tally has decreased by 138,266, or 5%, this year, indicating HODLing – a crypto slang for buy and hold – remains a preferred strategy in the market.  Investors typically take direct custody of coins when intending to hold them for a long term. A continued decline in BTC available on exchanges means fewer coins available for sale and the potential for an extended rally.  ""Underneath the surface, there is a heavy phase of accumulation on-chain,"" Blockware Solutions' market intelligence newsletter published on Friday said. ""Exchange outflows have reached a rate that has only ever occurred three times before in bitcoin's history: following March 2020, December 2020 (a lot of which was likely GBTC) and September 2021.""  Other metrics also paint a bullish picture. For instance, the percentage of bitcoin inactive for at least a year recently reached a record high of 63.7%. At the same time, whales (large investors) accumulated 1,000 BTC last week, registering the first weekly uptick since January, according to Blockware Solutions.  Even so, bitcoin fell to a one-month low of $38,577 during Asian trading hours, taking the year-to-date decline to over 15%. The selling pressure likely stemmed from tax issues and macro traders liquidating holdings, tracking a continued melt-up in government bond yields and likely tightening by the Federal Reserve.  Clearly, macro factors are in the driver's seat. ""For now, we'll continue to listen to every sound bite from Fed officials as they look to combat inflation via scare tactics,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, a crypto investment firm, noted last week. ""But one year from now, it's doubtful that the high correlation between rates, equities and digital assets will be anything besides another footnoted relationship that didn't hold.""  Bitcoin at key support  Bitcoin's three-day chart, where each candle represents price action for three days, shows the cryptocurrency is flirting with the 200-period simple moving average (SMA). That's a critical level to watch out for, given that bears have repeatedly failed to establish a foothold under the technical line since late January.  Should they succeed this time, more chart-driven selling may be seen. A breakdown would expose support at $30,000. The current three-day candle is set to close at 23:59 UTC on Monday.     Latest Headlines  Canada’s WonderFi Bulks Up Further With Planned $31M Acquisition of Coinberry Crypto Exchange  Bitcoin Slips Below Support Level to $38.5K as US Tax Return Deadline Approaches  Attacker Drains $182M From Beanstalk Stablecoin Protocol  Is Bitcoin a Risk-On or a Risk-Off Asset? Maybe It’s Neither  Why Crypto Isn’t Just the Great Financial Crisis, Part 2  Web 3 Gobsmacked as Meta Announces 47.5% Creator Fees  Sanctioned Crypto Wallet Linked to North Korean Hackers Keeps On Laundering  Is Bitcoin an Aspirational Store of Value?  By George Kaloudis  In times of high inflation and economic uncertainty, investors go risk-off, and there’s a “flight to quality.” In practice, when sentiment flips risk-off, investors sell their risky tech stocks and buy something like bonds, or if they really fear inflation, something sound like gold.  And you know what’s better than gold? Gold 2.0 of course. Bitcoin (or the Reserve Asset 3.0). We have high inflation, and so everyone piled into bitcoin and its price shot up, right? Not quite…  What gives? This is sound money, right? This is a store of value with a known current supply and emissions schedule, right? Isn’t bitcoin provably scarce? I thought the emissions schedule of bitcoin didn’t change as demand for the asset increased?  That’s all true: Bitcoin has a known monetary policy with a hard cap and a predetermined minting schedule; anyone with a full node (a basic computer with some software) can tell you how many bitcoins are in circulation and if the price of bitcoin went to $1 million tomorrow, the coins wouldn’t be mined any faster than they are today.  But there’s one thing missing. Narrative.  On a 60-day lookback, bitcoin’s price has been somewhat correlated (> 0.20 correlation coefficient) with the technology stocks in the Nasdaq for about 50% of trading days in 2022.  I think the reason for that is quite simple. While bitcoin’s hard money properties make it a risk-off asset for its supporters, investors see a risk-on asset because of its volatility and technology-like asymmetric price upside. When investors want to cut risk, they sell stocks alongside bitcoin. So bitcoin isn’t a risk-off or risk-on asset yet. Instead, I think it’s better to call it “risk everything.”  As such, it is probably more accurate to refer to bitcoin as an aspirational store of value.

42423521,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aWVh,1650287546,"Shiba, Dogecoin Among Biggest Losers as Macro Fears Lead to Market Fall","Poor macroeconomic sentiment and increasing fears of a recession in the West laid the backdrop for cryptocurrencies to lose 4% of their market capitalization in the past 24 hours, with several major tokens taking hits of up to 8%.  Analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note that the Federal Reserve's aggressive measures to control inflation could result in a recession. The investment bank put the odds of an economic contraction – a phase of the business cycle in which the economy as a whole is in decline – at about 35% over the next two years.  Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to under $38,500 during trading hours in Asia to change hands at its lowest point in over a month. That is despite April being a seasonally bullish month for the largest cryptocurrency when prices have risen seven times in April in the past 10 years, data shows.  Ether (ETH) lost the $3,000 mark, falling 10% in the past week. In the past 24 hours, Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA fell 6.6%, while meme coins Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) fell as much as 7%, leading losses among major cryptos.  DOGE prices fell after a sudden rally last week buoyed by positive sentiment as speculators bet on Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s intended takeover of social media giant Twitter (TWTR). Prices crossed $0.15 at the time, but fell to support at the $0.13 mark over the weekend.  Global markets affecting bitcoin recovery  Analysts said the slide in global markets contributed to a fall in bitcoin and crypto prices.  “Bitcoin declined for the second week in a row under negative stock market performance. Last week’s noticeable decline in bitcoin occurred amid a significant drawdown in US stock indices,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Global markets, however, would have to severely underperform if bitcoin were to fall further, analysts added.  “A consolidation scenario below $30K would require an absolute disaster in the financial markets,” Kuptsikevich said. “We have seen steady and impressive demand from long-term buyers as we have fallen into this area.”  Asian markets and U.S. futures fell on Monday amid concerns of faster policy tightening by the Fed. India’s Sensex ended 2.01% lower, and Singapore’s stock index lost nearly 1%. In the U.S., S&P 500 futures opened 0.26% lower, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 0.37%.  Gold reached five-week highs to just under $2,000. Natural gas prices surged to the highest intraday level in more than 13 years.  Bitcoin previously saw the $30,000 mark last July. It then erased losses over the following months to set a lifetime high of nearly $69,000 in November. Profit-taking and falling macroeconomic sentiment have dented grandiose price targets for bitcoin since then, with prices dropping 43%.  Meanwhile, tokens outside the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization saw even bigger losses. Chainlink’s LINK tokens dropped 9%, Bitcoin Cash’s BCH fell 10%, and Filecoin’s FIL fell 11%.  Among the handful of outperformers were Chain’s XCN and Stacks’ STX with upward of 6% in gains in the past 24 hours.",NEGATIVE,BCH | DOGE,BCH | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/18/shiba-dogecoin-among-biggest-losers-as-macro-fears-leads-to-market-fall,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65558fabb2c71a7a1465e8279801bc82c2bcab26-1440x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The takeover will begin with billboards showing an environmentalist call to action before going dark for an hour starting at 8 p.m. ET. The ad spending is pegged to Earth Day in the U.S.  The move comes as crypto’s carbon costs remain a lightning rod as the sector expands into the mainstream. The energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism employed by the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains differs from the proof-of-stake approach used by newer blockchains, including by Algorand.  Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden told CoinDesk via email that the event aims to both debunk myths about the carbon impact of blockchain technology and bring awareness to the environmental costs of Times Square billboards themselves.  “We wanted to make a bold statement on a large platform to educate the general public that advances in blockchain technology like those employed at Algorand have made it more green and sustainable than the first generation proof-of-work blockchains, and definitely more green than traditional banking and finance rails,” said Warden, a former executive director at J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM).  Times Square going dark for one hour saves 6,500 kilowatt hours of electricity, according to Algorand. Warden said that figure is equivalent to 350 million transactions on the Algorand blockchain.  “We want to set the bar for other projects to follow,” Warden said. “We want them to see that a blockchain can be energy-efficient and powerful enough to handle complex transactions at scale with finality and security.”  Plans to further Algorand’s carbon-negative pledge, made last Earth Day, are in the works, she added.",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/18/algorand-rents-times-square-billboard-to-tout-green-cred-ahead-of-earth-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74bea65ef186791174dcbd7cb577ebfea35b48b6-2048x1036.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A: Coinhako was founded in 2014 in Singapore, and the platform&apos;s mission is to be the go-to gateway to the crypto economy, providing easy access to digital assets and connecting users to the crypto space.

Will the downtrend reach the $0.044 mark? Key technical points: The MACD and signal lines continue a downtrend below the zero line. The VET coin price has descended by 25% within two weeks. Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of VET is $220 Million, marking a 25% rise. Past Performance of VET VET coin price fell by 33% in the past three weeks after facing immense supply pressure at the $0.085 mark resulting in fallout of multiple support levels. The altcoin failed to sustain above the 200-day EMA resulting in a fall under the 50-day EMA. The downtrend retests the 50-day EMA to continue the downtrend and approach the $0.055 level. Source-Tradingview VET Technical Analysis VET coin price action shows a breakout of the low formed at the $0.057 mark indicating a potential downtrend continuation to $0.044. However, safe traders might want to wait till the price crosses the $0.055 to avoid speculative risk. A grouping of EMAs (20, 50, 100, and 200) keeps a bearish pattern on the daily chart, including the 50-day EMA acting as dynamic resistance, forcing the price down. Hence, the 50-day EMA plays a crucial role in sabotaging bullish growth.

Investor interest has fallen significantly and this is clearly seen in the trading volumes. However, there was still hope for a bright future. Why? Buyers controlled the main trend line, below which the ONT price has not fallen since March 2020. https://www.tradingview.com/x/HJkfj3yk/ During the trading week of 17 January, this trend line was won by sellers. Looking at the trading volumes and the fullness of the weekly candle, there was no struggle. Since then, the ONT price hasn&apos;t been able to grow above the $0.63 mark. In fact, the ONT price has been trading below the global trend line for 4 months in the form of correction. At the same time, trading volumes are the lowest for the last year. This position of buyers clearly shows at least the unwillingness to form a new wave of growth. While the $0.63 mark is under the control of sellers, we expect the ONT price to continue falling with the first target of $0.35. This mark is the previous local low from December 2021.

Violation does not mean a change of initiative. However, the first steps to weaken the trend of sellers were taken. From 14 March, on a weekly timeframe, buyers managed to form a three-week growth wave. In the weekly timeframe, this is not at all reminiscent of a strong trend, but rather a small rebound from the liquidity level of $1.25. The rebound was stopped by sellers near the local mark of $2. The trading volumes during the local rebound of ENJ price was ridiculous and did not predict the formation of a powerful growth wave. However, it is worth focusing on the events of the ENJ market on 4 April. https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xb4oTgT0/ As early as the third week, sellers are trying to put pressure on the price and continue the downward trend. Thus, the chart no longer has such aggressive weekly candles that were in January 2021. Although buyers have not shown enough initiative and strength, sellers are also not surprised by the power. Their three-week attack is as insignificant as the 14 March buyers&apos; attack. So in the ENJ market there are competitions on the insignificance of price movements.

The Vancouver-based WonderFi recently closed its $162 million acquisition of Bitbuy, a crypto trading platform in Canada with over 400,000 users. Coinberry currently services more than 220,000 registered Canadian clients. WonderFi expects the all-stock deal for Coinberry to close in Q2.  Canada’s crypto market remains fragmented, thus consolidation is key for WonderFi, according to CEO Ben Samaroo. WonderFi is also planning to expand globally this year while diversifying its offerings of digital asset products.  Samaroo noted that WonderFi is in the process of expanding Bitbuy’s brand into Australia, while “actively looking” at U.S. expansion later this year.

That deal is also expected to close during Q2.  “It’s really another stream to acquire users,” Samaroo said of the Sun Machine deal, noting its potential to reach users who aren’t focused on crypto trading. In turn, those gamers can earn NFTs and claim them through WonderFi’s combined platforms.  The company counts O’Leary and FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried as strategic investors.  “Compliant access to crypto is what matters and WonderFi has quickly established itself as a leader in Canada.

42423527,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aWdh,1650272891,Bitcoin Slips Below Support Level to $38.5K as US Tax Return Deadline Approaches,"Bitcoin (BTC) has breached critical price support to hit one-month lows as the U.S. tax season draws to a close.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell to $38,577 during the Asian hours, a level last seen on March 15, according to CoinDesk data. Per analytics firm IntoTheBlock, $40,000 was important support, as significant buying activity has happened around that level in the past. The latest decline means the cryptocurrency has lost over 17% since testing waters above $48,000 three weeks ago.  The weakness appears to have stemmed from tax-related selling and a murky macro environment. For U.S. investors, the deadline to submit 2021 tax returns or an extension to file and pay the tax is Monday, April 18, 2022. Last year, market players sold digital assets during the tax season, between Jan. 1 and April 15, Coinbase's David Duong said in a recent weekly email.  ""Tax-related selling has definitely played a role in recent weeks,"" Jeff Anderson, CIO at the quantitative trading firm and liquidity provider Folkvang Trading, said in a Telegram chat. ""However, it's difficult to say exactly how much of the weakness has been due to the impending tax deadline.""  Anderson added that ""people were positioned for an end of tax selling Monday and the [continued rise] in yields has scuppered that.""  The U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yield rose to a 2.88% early on Monday, the highest level since December 2018, per data provided by charting platform TradingView. The nominal and real or inflation-adjusted U.S. bond yields have been on a tear in recent weeks, thanks to high inflation and the Federal Reserve's plans to deliver rapid-fire rate hikes. So risk assets, including technology stocks and cryptocurrencies, have come under pressure.  According to George Liu, head of derivatives at Babel Finance, bitcoin's strengthening correlation to stocks could be the more dominant reason behind the dip below $40,000.  ""The tax issue has been known and anticipated in the markets already, so we don't see that as a decisive factor for the current price dip,"" Liu said. ""Basically, the short-term correlation between bitcoin and U.S. stocks has reached a new peak.""  Crypto services provider Amber Group voiced a similar opinion, saying, ""a lot has to do with the poor macro conditions... look at equities and Nasdaq [tech-heavy index] and the rise in the real yields.""  The rolling 90-day correlation between bitcoin and the Nasdaq Composite recently broke above 0.6, according to institutional bitcoin broker NYDIG.  Who is selling?  Blockchain data shows the selling pressure is likely coming from short-term traders with significant holdings.  ""Checking on the overall Bitcoin network movement from spent output age band USD and spent output value band USD, it seems like the cohort most active during the price change seen a few hours ago was mostly 0~1 week aged coins + UTXO volume in 1M+ USD,"" Chan Chung, head of marketing from South Korea-based analytics firm CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  The spent output age band is a set of all spent outputs created within a specified age band that flowed into exchange wallets. As Chung said, mostly 0-1 week aged coins were in action on Monday, meaning the selling pressure likely stemmed from short-term traders.  Further, the spent output value band, which shows the distribution of all spent outputs according to their value, shows most of the coins that moved into exchanges early today were from 10-100 BTC and 100 BTC and 1,000 BTC cohorts.  However, the data is subject to different interpretations; given blockchain metrics have their limitations. A whale, or large coin holder, can hold its stack in multiple addresses for years. ""Whales might have split their wallet yesterday, which makes it look like 0~1 day UTXO; in reality, it could have been aged for more than three years,"" Chung noted.  Bearish derivative market flows  Derivative traders seem to be positioning for an extended decline in bitcoin, as evidenced by the rising put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls.  According to Babel's Liu, open interest in the cash-margined perpetual futures market is increasing alongside the demand for downside hedging. In other words, traders appear to be betting on a downward move.  That could be the case because funding rates, or the cost of holding long or short positions in the perpetual futures market, have turned negative, according to data from Coinglass.com  ""Selling pressure resurfaced in the perpetual market as bid transactions surpassed the ask side,"" said Glassnode's Uncharted newsletter, dated April 17. ""The number of perpetual contracts with negative funding rates increased, reinforcing the downward pressure.""  A negative funding rate implies traders have a strong belief that the market is going down and they are paying a cost to shorten it.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/18/bitcoin-slips-below-support-level-to-385k-as-us-tax-return-deadline-approaches,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6a9d8ffe943a3743339a36223abfdb3e0d0a885-1722x840.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
