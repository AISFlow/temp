During an hour-long question-and-answer session, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis – one of 12 regional banks that make up the U.S. central banking system – answered questions on Twitter with economist David Andolfatto, who is a vice president in the bank's research division.  During the session, one user asked whether cryptocurrencies can be used to solve the 50-year-old Triffin Dilemma, which refers to the conflicting interests between national and global monetary policy for a country whose currency is used as the world's reserve.  Specifically, it refers to the U.S. dollar, which has been considered a world reserve currency for decades. In order to maintain this role, the U.S. must incur a trade deficit.  When posed the Triffin Dilemma question, Andolfatto responded:  ""The Triffin Dilemma refers to the double-edged sword of possessing a currency that serves as the world reserve currency. If a private cryptocurrency were to replace a given world reserve currency, this would eliminate the dilemma for that currency.""  Other questions asked during the session ranged from whether Andolfatto thought a cryptocurrency could replace the U.S. dollar or whether the Federal Reserve is likely to ever consider monetary policy in terms of cryptocurrencies.  The economist demurred on both counts, noting that cryptocurrencies are essentially private monies, and therefore not something that would fall under the central bank's purview.  Moreover, because there is ""no need for decentralized consensus based record keeping"" for the dollar, he does not see it being replaced with a cryptocurrency.  Andolfatto also does not see the demand for cryptocurrencies supplanting the demand for existing reserve currencies, he added.

42381318,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Zed,1538510739,'Bitcoin Bug' Exploited on Crypto Fork as Attacker Prints 235 Million Pigeoncoins,"A severe bug discovered just weeks ago in bitcoin's code has been exploited – albeit on a lesser-known cryptocurrency.  The developers behind the pigeoncoin cryptocurrency confirmed the exploit to CoinDesk on Tuesday, reporting that an unknown attacker successfully took advantage of the bug on September 26th, showcasing in the wild how it could have been used on bitcoin by printing 235 million coins worth about $15,000.  That's because while the severe inflation bug was patched on bitcoin, other coins that have borrowed bitcoin's public code over the years are still vulnerable (if they haven't corrected their code). If exploited, the bug gives an attacker the ability to print as many coins as they want, going even above the hard-coded limitations on supply cryptocurrencies often have and decreasing the value of all the other coins investors hold.  Set apart by its X16r mining algorithm, pigeoncoin is not exactly a big cryptocurrency, not even ranking in the top 1,000 in terms of how valuable it is compared to others on CoinMarketCap. Still, the attack may be no less impactful on its efforts to use a blockchain to ""end abusive data collection.""  With a total supply of 970 million pigeoncoins, the attacker was able to print an amount equal to one-fourth of all publicly traded pigeoncoins, prompting one of the only exchanges to support the currency, CryptoBridge, to temporarily suspend trading while developers moved to enact a fix.  After the inflation was detected, developers of the coin quickly released a software fix borrowing from the code bitcoin developers put out a couple of weeks ago. ""Pools and exchanges must upgrade immediately to resolve a double-spend exploit derived from bitcoin source,"" the notes for the fix explain.  But while users might not particularly care about what happens to the little-known coin, the exploit has wider implications for the cryptocurrency world.  Cryptocurrency developer Scott Roberts argued that the main takeaway from this event is that the bitcoin bug was really as bad as it sounded:  ""Mainly it's just nice to know for sure by this example that coins in the wild were really vulnerable. It was not just some vague theoretical problem.""  What's next  Now the bug is fixed, observers are wondering what the attacker will do and whether he or she will successful be able to trade their gains for fiat money. In order to do so, the attacker most likely will need to convert their pigeoncoin into another cryptocurrency that's more widely accepted.  ""Many of us are now waiting to see what happens with the hacked coins and if there's going to be a dump soon,"" pigeoncoin developer Michael Oates told CoinDesk.  The community is following the events closely in the pigeoncoin Discord chat channel. ""My guess is the funds won't move for a few days. It would be stupid to try and move them all at once,"" Oates added on Discord.  The other big concern is, if pigeoncoin was attacked, what about other coins that have cloned bitcoin's code?  ""It would be interesting to see how many coins suffered an attack due to [the] bug,"" Roberts told CoinDesk, adding that pigeoncoin is the only one he knows has been exploited so far.  Still, Roberts added that many cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin gold and litecoin, have now upgraded, so hopefully the same attack won't be executed on other coins.  He concluded:  ""It looks like most coins have already updated, so it's not likely to be a problem.""

The browser-based wallet was launched earlier this year in an effort to enable instant bitcoin cash transactions. At present, Telescope can operate on Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, according to a press release, though the team it plans to expand to other platforms following the acquisition.  Supported by BitPay and moneybutton.com, the wallet stores cryptographic keys within a browser extension, meaning transactions are signed by the user's browser directly. The project says that storing funds in this way offers users similar security to standalone wallets.  Nishant Sharma, head of international press relations and communications at Bitmain, said in the release that Telescope brings a ""simple but key innovation"" to the bitcoin cash ecosystem.  He added:  ""Browser-embedded cryptocurrency wallets are a promising technology. The Telescope development team is doing some very interesting work and we look forward to working together with them on the Telescope project and future bitcoin cash projects.""  Bitmain holds nearly 6 percent of the total bitcoin cash in existence, as previously reported. The company has faced some controversy for this decision, given that its holdings have devalued through the 2018 bear market and that it's planning a Hong Kong IPO.  Specifically, while Bitmain held nearly $900 million in the cryptocurrency at the beginning of 2018, its value has depreciated roughly 20 percent in the last 10 months.

42381314,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94ZYL,1538492662,South Korea's Policy Chief Calls for Legalization of ICOs,"The chairman of Korea's National Policy Committee has called for the legalization of initial coin offerings (ICOs), provided that a regulatory framework is put in place.  According to a report from CoinDesk Korea on Tuesday, Min Byung-Doo, who is a member of the country's governing Democratic party, said that, with token sales becoming a global trend, ""I do not want the ICO door closed completely ... The state should not ignore [the issue].""  The policy chief spoke earlier Tuesday during 8th plenary session of the National Assembly, at which lawmakers posed questions to the administration.  In order to create trust in the industry, ICOs should also be regulated, Min stressed. However, the official pointed to reluctance on the part of the government to draw up new rules as a prevailing issue.  Specifically, he said that ""fraud, speculation and capital laundering must be strictly prohibited,"" and the crypto industry would need to self-regulate and introduce safety standards as well.  The country's financial watchdog, the Financial Services Commission, announced a ban on ICOs in September 2017, although the law has not yet been enacted, according to the report.  The lawmaker pointed to the economic advantages of token sales, saying that while there is a pessimistic view of cryptocurrencies in some quarters, many token projects are seen as having a viable future.  Raising the vast sums of money that have been raised in some token sales, Min said:  ""We can see that the flow of investment is clearly changing compared to ICO and angel fundraising. The ICO has raised $1.7 billion for Telegram and $4 billion for Block.One, It is getting bigger and bigger.""  Efforts thus far  Several bills seeking to provide a legal framework for cryptocurrencies have already been proposed to the National Assembly in South Korea, with such legislation coming under the jurisdiction of the Political Affairs Committee, CoinDesk Korea previously reported.  With Min being chairman of the committee and now strongly expressing his belief that ICOs should be allowed in law, the odds of regulations being passed in the near future may have just increased. However, any legal measures must pass a vote of the Politburo Committee at a future plenary session.  Further, while Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon is a supporter of blockchain technology, he has said that the government banned ICOs over concerns about ""side-effects and market overheating.""  In separate statements today, Min told a panel discussion with the Korean government's science chief, ""Let the government, the National Assembly and the blockchain association quickly create a working group to block fraud, speculation, money laundering and develop the block-chain industry.""

42381313,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94ZX5,1538488811,Crypto Mining for Political Campaigns? A US Elections Agency Is Considering It,"The U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) is considering a request that, if approved, would allow people to volunteer for political campaigns by lending some of their computing power to mine cryptocurrencies.  The request  from OsiaNetwork LLC, quietly published in late September, is the first of its kind, and if given the thumbs-up would represent a new way for cryptocurrencies to be used to support political efforts in the U.S. The request is currently subject to a public comment period.  In May 2014, the FEC gave its approval for bitcoin donations as a form of in-kind contribution to campaigns.  The company wants to serve as the platform through which would-be ""volunteers"" can give up their devices' processing power to mine, effectively serving as a mining pool but with a decidedly political bent.  ""OsiaNetwork would allow volunteers to support federal political committees by 'pooling' the processing power of their internet enabled devices to mine cryptocurrencies. OsiaNetwork believes that enabling individual volunteers to so 'pool' the processing power of their internet enabled devices would allow individuals to support their preferred candidates, which they would not otherwise be able to do,"" the request states.  According to the document, volunteers would designate which devices they want to use, and as long as they're actively signed into OsiaNetwork's website, their computing power would be used to generate new cryptocurrency.  ""Mining rewards will be allocated among OsiaNetwork's clients proportionately to the number of hashes that each committee's volunteers generate in order to solve the block that generates the mining reward,"" the company explained. ""OsiaNetwork will maintain a separate account for each of its clients that reflects on an ongoing basis the number of hashes generated by the individual volunteers of that particular client.""  OsiaNetwork goes on to clarify that it, not the volunteers themselves, will receive the generated coins. Volunteers ""will not have ownership interest in or any rights to the mining reward at any point.""  Notably, the request seeks to allow political campaigns themselves to solicit such a donation option, with OsiaNetwork connecting to their websites and enabling contributors to sign up from that point.  As OsiaNetwork explained:  ""If a federal political committee would like to allow their individual supporters to volunteer the processing power of their internet enabled devices, OsiaNetwork will provide the tools necessary to create a webpage on that committee's website that provides the methodology to pool the processing power of these volunteers' internet enabled devices.""  In return, OsiaNetwork would take a share of the mining rewards earned, ""and the percentage will not change based on how much cryptocurrency is mined.""  ""This fee will include a reasonable profit,"" the company added.

While one of the firms has a native token (DFINITY), the rest represent equity investment, says Diar.  Explaining why it believes VC has seen a sudden spike in popularity among startups seeking funding, Diar says that 70 percent of ICO tokens are now valued lower than during their respective sales. Further, ""the majority of tokens have dropped in price by more than 90 percent from their all time highs,"" it said.  The research company also cites regulation and issues with the ICO projects themselves as further reasons for a drop in popularity of token-based fundraising, saying:  ""Non-equity ICOs are not only scrutinized by the regulators but the founders also have very misaligned incentives as there is no contractual obligation to deliver a product – a reality that to date seems to be the case with few launches, and even less adoption.""  The amount being raised through ICOs, as well as the number of projects successfully completing token sales, ""is now approaching a one year low,"" according to the report.

42381327,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94Zpx,1538478011,50-Day Moving Average Is Newest Hurdle for Battered Bitcoin Price,"Bitcoin's price looks vulnerable to modest slippage in the next 24 hours, as its persistent failure to pass a key moving average hurdle could embolden the bears.  The leading cryptocurrency has been in a narrow sideways drift in recent days, with the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) proving a tough nut to crack since Saturday.  BTC's inability to cross the 50-day hurdle indicates that the bullish move from the Sept. 19 low of $6,100 has lost momentum. As a result, the door is now open for the bears to make their presence felt over the next 24 hours, and prices could be forced down to $6,300.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,580 on Bitfinex, having faced rejection at the 50-day EMA level of $6,649 earlier today.  Daily chart  As seen on the daily chart, the 50-day EMA has been capping the upside in BTC since late September. It is worth noting that BTC is trading below all three major moving averages – 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMA – which could be considered a bearish sign.  However, these averages are flatlined, which indicates that BTC has lacked a clear directional bias for far too long. As a result, a big move in either direction is overdue.  4-hour chart  Over on the 4-hour chart, BTC is trading just below the lower edge of the ascending triangle, meaning the bull failure at the 50-day EMA is beginning to prove costly.  Furthermore, the relative strength index (RSI) has fallen back below 50.00 in bearish territory.  A downside break would be confirmed if the current or the next 4-hour candle closes below the triangle support. In that case, BTC could fall quickly to $6,328 (Sept. 28 low).  View  BTC's persistent failure to move past the 50-day EMA could end up yielding an ascending triangle breakdown on the 4-hour chart.  An ascending triangle breakdown, if confirmed, would open up downside towards the immediate support of $6,328 (Sept. 28 low). A violation there would expose the next support, lined up at $6,100.  On the higher side, acceptance above the 50-day EMA of $6,649 would put the bulls back in a commanding position.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42381295,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94XB9,1538474407,Google Moves to Protect Chrome Users From Cryptojacking and Hacks,"Google is bringing in stricter rules for Chrome extension developers, a move should reduce the risk of crypto hacks and mining malware.  Announced Monday, the web and technology giant is planning a series of changes to the way Chrome handles extensions that request extensive permissions, and is also tightening the rules for developers distributing extensions via the Chrome Web Store.  Google said in a blog post:  ""It's crucial that users be able to trust the extensions they install are safe, privacy-preserving, and performant. Users should always have full transparency about the scope of their extensions' capabilities and data access.""  From Chrome 70 (currently in beta), users will have the ability to restrict an extension's access to a custom list of sites, or to set extensions to require permission each time they need to gain access to a page, the company explains.  Google adds that extensions that request ""powerful permissions"" will be subjected to ""additional compliance review.""  ""We're also looking very closely at extensions that use remotely hosted code, with ongoing monitoring,"" the post states.  The firm explains the move, saying ""While host permissions have enabled thousands of powerful and creative extension use cases, they have also led to a broad range of misuse – both malicious and unintentional ... Our aim is to improve user transparency and control over when extensions are able to access site data.""  Google also said that, from Monday, Chrome Web Store will no longer allow extensions with hidden, or obfuscated, code. Existing extensions with obfuscated code have 90 days to comply with the new rule, it adds.  According to the post, more than 70 percent of ""malicious and policy violating extensions"" that Google blocks from the Web Store contain obfuscated code. Further, as obfuscation is ""mainly used to conceal code functionality,"" it greatly adds to the complexity of the Google's extension review process.  ""This is no longer acceptable given the aforementioned review process changes,"" Google stated.  And in a final security measure, in 2019, all extension developer accounts must be protected by 2-step verification to lower the risk of hackers taking over an account.  In the past, Chrome extensions have been used by cyber-criminals to provide access to victims machines.  For example, just a month ago, hackers uploaded a malicious version of the Mega extension to the Web Store. People who used the official installer over the next few hours had their accounts compromised, according to ZDNet – including users of the MyEtherWallet and MyMonero crypto wallets, and decentralized exchange IDEX.  Google has also been forced to crack down on extensions that used downloaders' devices to mine cryptocurrencies without their knowledge. In April, the Web Store blocked extensions that mine cryptocurrencies, whether or not mining was a deliberate feature.

42381292,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94X8d,1538470853,CryptoKitties By the Dozen: OpenSea to Bundle Collectibles for Easy Sales,"Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs – the cryptographically rare digital items CryptoKitties made famous – are so new, they're challenging for prospective sellers to price.  That's according to Devin Finzer, co-founder of OpenSea, a startup billed as an ""eBay for CryptoKitties,"" but that is aiming to stake its claim more broadly as a platform for blockchain-based collectibles.  This issue in mind, the company, backed by investors like Founders Fund and Coinbase Ventures, is announcing a new feature Monday called ""bundles,"" which allows users to sell multiple NFTs at a single, fixed price.  Finzer told CoinDesk:  ""We think sellers often struggle to accurately price their items, and bundles allows them to price a bunch of items together when the value of each individual item is unclear.""  Like sales of individual items, bundles can either be sold at a fixed price or auctioned.  In a blog post, the OpenSea team highlighted how the feature will add to the maturing ecosystem surrounding crypto collectibles, one of the more new and still experimental use cases for the technology.  ""At OpenSea, we believe a big driver of these new economies is a robust, easy-to-use toolset for buyers and sellers,"" the blog post continued. ""Bundling is one of those tools.""  Gas problems  Bundling – through bulk sales, grab bags and other types of collections – has existed for a long time in markets for analog collectibles.  For instance, on eBay, collectors can sell more than one comic book at a time, since if bundling wasn't available, it wouldn't be worth it to try an offload anything except the most popular issues. Owners can then recoup some value from the less sought-after items by selling them in batches.  Similarly, Finzer told CoinDesk that he's spoken to users who have crypto collectibles that aren't even worth the ethereum gas it would cost to sell them individually. As such, the ability to sell groups of items is helpful.  Further, some new crypto projects are generating categories of NFTs that might only make sense to sell in bundles. For example, Finzer told CoinDesk how the bundle feature could help one of its partners, Etheremon, which recreates the Pokemon Go experience.  ""Users can earn special crystals and power-ups by going on quests,"" Finzer said. ""Since each user might have a ton of those items, bundling is really helpful.""  Any new ERC-721 project will be able to sell bundles on OpenSea. For companies using OpenSea's API to put items into its marketplace, bundles will work through that interface as well.  Plus, OpenSea respects custody; users can play with bundled items on sale up to the moment they transfer ownership.  User enthusiasm  Since late September, some users have actually been able to list bundles. (During this beta phase, OpenSea users made 137 such listings).  MLB Crypto Baseball, a version of fantasy baseball where players own NFTs representing real-world players that they assemble into teams, is a prime example of where bundles could be beneficial. In that way, sellers can make bundles that will allow newbies to get started easily.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Finzer said, ""There's also recently been a lot of excitement about the bundling feature in the MLB Crypto Baseball Discord. There's already a bundle listed with three entire MLB baseball teams in it.""  Plus, this decentralization of game pieces can open up even more possibilities.  In fact, a user can now sell a selection of NFTs from across multiple games. As of this writing, there is a bundle on sale mixing NFTs from decentralized applications CryptoKitties, ETHTown and War Riders.  In this way, OpenSea expects users will explore even more strategies, like including one slightly more valuable item in a group to entice people to buy a whole group of items.

The company announced Monday that it was looking for legal counsel in the U.S., which 1Broker hopes to do within the next few days. Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused the company of violating federal law by allowing U.S. investors to trade on its platform.  That process aside, 1Broker's lawyers are said to have granted the company permission to set up the read-only version for customers to view their balances and transaction history. This site should be up by Wednesday, according to a tweet.  The company is emphasizing that customers' funds remain safe, saying:  ""Currently, our top priority is to allow customer withdrawals. The company holds enough funds to cover all withdrawal requests, of course. Before we can take the required steps to do that, we have to seek permission from the authorities.""  The FBI seized the 1broker.com domain in the wake of last week's charges, causing the company to suspend transactions, 1Broker said in a statement. A post to its parent company 1Pool's website notes that ""the trading panel is not accessible anymore.""  CEO Patrick Brunner told CoinDesk that the company is asking for patience from its users.  ""Unfortunately, such matters take some time – from our point of view, we are ready to process withdrawals right now,"" he said in an email.

Announced Tuesday, KIP is investing an undisclosed amount of money into Temco, a blockchain-based startup that aims to revolutionize supply chain management systems for small- to medium-sized businesses (SMEs) using blockchain technology. Specifically, according to Temco's website, vendors can track the movements of products from distribution to eventual consumption on a blockchain, and then share the data as well.  ""Temco is more than prepared to disrupt contemporary supply chain process,"" Jong Hyun Kim, the fintech investment board member of KIP, stated in the official press release, adding:  ""Not only does Temco exceed existing business solutions, but also is a prime example of the potential of blockchain technology.""  KIP is widely regarded for investing in major billion-dollar Korean enterprises such as the country's largest web search engine, Naver, and Kakao, the operator of the country's dominant mobile messaging app Kakao Talk.  The news further signals a thawing of some resistance to the still-nascent blockchain industry, after domestic financial regulators in South Korea laid down strict restrictions for the sale and other operations of cryptocurrency about a year ago. Since then, there has been considerable renewed support for friendlier policies toward blockchain.  For instance, in early August, the governor of Jeju province, Won Hee-ryong, proposed allowing South Korea's Jeju Islands to become a so-called ""free zone"" for crypto startups that want to conduct initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Plus last month, the South Korean government was reported to be investing over $880 million in 2019 to boost technological innovation in the country, with a portion of that fund going into developing blockchain technology for ""data management security and boosting the sharing economy.""

An unnamed agent with the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Intérieure (DGSI) was indicted last Wednesday and taken into custody two days later after allegedly peddling economic information and potentially falsifying administrative documents, according to Le Parisien.  The agent had been working with members of an organized crime group, as well as specialists in economics, according to the report. However, it does not appear that the suspect has worked with any terrorist groups.  Members of the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police, another crime-fighting unit in the country, first discovered the leaks, according to the news outlet. DGSI members then used the agent's personal code to track his online activities.  Specifically, the agency's internal security service traced ""the origin of file queries"" during the investigation.  Le Monde further reported that after the agent's arrest, L'Office central pour la répression de l'immigration irrégulière et de l'emploi d'étrangers sans titre, or the agency in charge of monitoring ""irregular immigration,"" dismantled the criminal network with which the suspect had been working.  It is unclear how much information was sold or how much the agent made in bitcoin. If convicted, the agent faces seven years in prison and a potential 100,000 euro fine.

42381306,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX94XQF,1538445610,IOTA Ends September With Steepest Decline Among Top Crypto Assets,"Down 23.21 percent, MIOTA, the cryptocurrency that powers the IOTA software, has officially ended September's trading period as the biggest loser among the largest 25 crypto assets by market capitalization.  Data reveals MIOTA limped across the finish line as the month came to a close, expending declines that began with highs set in late August when the crypto asset traded as high as $0.79. September, however, saw an unsuccessful effort by IOTA bulls to stem what would ultimately prove to be a sizable sell-off, with the cryptocurrency reaching a low of $0.50 according to exchange data from Binance, the world's most active trading platform.  Still, this may say more about the market itself than the performance of MIOTA.  Overall, September had been dogged by a larger bitcoin sell-off that dragged down prices in the broader cryptocurrency market, creating a lot of ""chop"" but little in the way of substantial moves.  Adding credence to this assessment is that the cryptocurrency's market capitalization has largely recouped losses, rising from a September 12 low of $186.3 billion to $223 billion by September 30. Further, the loss of liquidity during the first half of the month meant that price action on some lesser known cryptocurrencies stalled, leaving them caught between various ranges or channels before falling victim to the larger sell-off in major cryptocurrencies.  MIOTA  Monthly performance: -23.21 percent  All-time high: $5.23  Closing price on September 30: $0.56  Current market price: $0.58  Rank as per market capitalization: 11  As shown above, MIOTA's downward move began at the start of the month, accelerating on September 1 when prices dipped by 12 percent and continued to be held under as the markets took a turn for the worse.  September 5-6 saw MIOTA suffer the greatest losses, shedding 16 cents. The rest of the month didn't fare better either as bulls attempted several small recovery bounces, but were held back by the tight grip of bitcoin's daily sell-pressure.  MIOTA made a final attempt to surpass $0.65 on September 22 but was swiftly knocked down after it failed to produce any significant higher highs to break the downward trend.  Still, MIOTA's 30-day volatility was 33.71% on the month, an average figure for a top 25 crypto.  Daily chart  The chart above shows MIOTA has the potential to break out from its bearish September conditions as prices seem to have found a short-term bottom around the $0.50-$0.51 range.  Volume has also begun to pick up in October, most notably during the second half of the month when IOTA went into consolidation and recovery mode. Indeed, confirmation from increasing total growing volume is a positive sign when stacking the odds in favor of a bullish breakout as the ranging channel begins to narrow once again.  Speaking of volume, patterns generally require a substantial amount to back what you are seeing as a valid formation.  The ascending triangle on the daily chart for MIOTA shows potential for a break above the previous daily high of $0.60 should a large injection of volume make its way onto the charts, just prior to the breakout.  A large rally and close above $0.65 (the 55-day Fibonacci exponential moving average) would signal a long-term bear-to-bull trend change aided by the breakout from the ascending triangle formation.  Dropping below the heavily defended $0.50 zone would entrench the greater bear bias that has continued to grip the markets since January of this year.
