42398639,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdAx6,1441229796,Bitcoin Exchange itBit Hires NYDFS Lawyer for Compliance Role,"ItBit has hired former New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) general counsel Daniel ""Danny"" Alter as its general counsel and chief compliance officer.  The three-year veteran of the NYDFS was involved in the formation of the New York BitLicense, the controversial licensing regime for digital currency businesses seeking to serve consumers in the US state, before departing in February. The move is perhaps surprising given the originally skeptical outlook on the technology Alter voiced at the New York BitLicense hearings in early 2014.  At the two-day event, Alter was perhaps the most outspoken of NYDFS representatives on the potential downsides of digital currency regulation, arguing that the state's money laundering obligations should take priority over innovation and that the decentralized payment network's mining community represented a ""systemic threat"" to its operations.  In interview, Alter indicated that his opinion on the technology has since evolved as he became ""incredibly fascinated"" with developments in the field. Today, he finds that bitcoin and the blockchain could offer solutions for the very challenges it seemed to initially pose.  Alter told CoinDesk:  ""At NYDFS, I had a special focus on anti-money laundering and economic sanctions enforcement. I thought [blockchain technology] had incredible applications and if it grows and is adopted more broadly could ... reduce regulatory costs. There's substantial time and effort that goes into compliance and this may provide an important answer to that problem.""  Alter framed his interest in a position at itBit as an extension of his interests in compliance and regulation.  ""Over the months it came to pass I had this opportunity with itbit and thought this was a tremendous opportunity to pursue that,"" he said.  As for any potential conflict of interest from the appointment, Alter stated his position that he did not participate in the granting of itBit's New York banking charter. The approval, secured at the time of the company's $25m Series A in May, grants itBit the ability to serve customers in 50 US states and to hold customer deposits.  The comments position Alter in contrast to former NYDFS superintendent Ben Lawsky, who has previously indicated that he is unable to work with bitcoin industry firms as a private consultant.  ""I had no discussions about ever going to work with itBit, that didn't come up until months after I left NYDFS,"" Alter said. ""My ethical requirements are defined by NY state law, and I'm sure there isn't the conflict of interest for me that a superintendent would encounter.""  Alter's appointment coincides with the hiring of CFO Kim Petry, who formerly served as CFO and vice president of global commercial and corporate card payment at American Express.  New responsibilities  In regards to his new role at itBit, Alter indicated that he would play an ""active role"" in working with regulators as they seek to inform their positions on the technology.  ""I understand the benefits of the platform and can accommodate their concerns, adjusting the business and the message of doing business in a way that will give regulators security that it is being done right,"" he continued.  Alter suggested that within the next three to six months he will be working with itBit to develop strategic relationships with investors, while also attending to the company's compliance efforts.  He further suggested that he would be uniquely suited toward helping others understand the potential of blockchain technology in financial transactions and settlement, while dissuading concerns similar to his own after first learning of the technology.  Alter said:  ""Coming from where I come from, I have a sense of what those concerns are.""  At press time, the NYDFS had not responded to requests for comment.

42398631,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdArC,1441225096,Proposed California Bitcoin Bill Adds New Reporting Requirements,"The California Senate Appropriations Committee has voted 6-1 to advance a bill that would create a licensing regime for bitcoin companies in the state.  The bill moved forward on 27th August, with Senator Jim Nielsen, a Republican from California's Fourth District, casting the lone dissenting vote. The bill received a second reading on Monday, with a third reading set for a later date.  AB-1326's movement through the California Senate – it passed the lower chamber in June – comes as groups supporting and opposing the measure spar over the law's wording. The bill, introduced by Assemblyman Matt Dababneh in February, was amended earlier this summer to include a provisional regulatory on-ramp for nascent companies.  The latest version of the bill, amended as of 18th August, includes a passage that would add new reporting requirements to licensed businesses beyond existing language that mandates annual and quarterly financial audits.  The bill reads:  ""Each licensee shall file an annual report with the commissioner, on or before the 15th day of March, providing the relevant information that the commissioner reasonably requires concerning the business and operations conducted by the licensee within the state during the preceding calendar year. Each licensee shall also make other special reports to the commissioner that may be required by the commissioner from time to time.""  New language was also added to a passage that outlined how the state would evaluate companies seeking provisional license.  ""The bill would authorize the commissioner to request reports and documents, to examine the provisional licensee, and gather information regarding the business and operations of provisional licensees,"" the text reads. ""The bill would require reports and documents concerning the business and operations of provisional licensees to be kept confidential.""  If passed and signed into law, the bill would take effect on 1st July 2016.

42398638,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdAv8,1441212375,Paymium Raises €1 Million to Boost Bitcoin Merchant Onboarding,"Bitcoin payments services startup Paymium has raised €1m in new seed funding from investors including Newfund and Kima Ventures.  Founded in 2011, Paris-based Paymium, while not a marquee name in its sector, has so far garnered notable partnerships with online fashion retailer Showroomprive – then the largest merchant in Europe – and point-of-sale solution provider Ingenico.  Despite the success in its home market, however, Paymium president and co-founder Pierre Noizat suggested the funding round was perhaps lower than it would have been if the company had been focused on the US market.  Noizat told CoinDesk:  ""In the US, bitcoin awareness and venture capital funds are much more available. I think there is a tendency in the press to overestimate bitcoin awareness outside English speaking countries. There's a lot to be done in Europe.""  Noizat said Paymium intends to spread awareness in major European economies by expanding its payment, exchange and application services to more regional markets.  As part of the expansion, Noizat said Paymium will likely grow its team to 12 members by the end of next year, up from eight today. Noizat added Paymium believes it's too early to concentrate the efforts of these workers on one specific service, however.  ""It's hard to say which is our primary business, we don't know yet whether bitcoin will be a mass market payment method for individuals or blockchain tech applications,"" he continued. ""We want to be full-service.""  The news comes amid an increasingly active time in the European bitcoin payments sector, following the 12th August announcement Denmark-based Coinify had acquired rival Coinzone.  By far the largest startups serving the European merchant market, however, are based in the US, with Coinbase and BitPay having both expanded to the market in the last year.  Still, Noizat said Paymium is interested in collaborating with these groups, and believes it will have a competitive advantage given it is headquartered in Europe.  He concluded:  ""We feel good because the ground is very vast, tens of thousands of merchants have yet to adopt bitcoin, so we welcome big players pushing bitcoin to more merchants.""

42398653,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdAu9,1441200059,Coinbase Expands to Asia With Singapore Market Launch,"Coinbase is now offering consumers in Singapore the ability to buy and sell bitcoin using Singapore dollars, a move that marks its formal introduction to the Asian market.  The announcement follows on the heels of the news Coinbase would launch services in Canada following a partnership with bitcoin compliance firm Vogogo. Coinbase, which has raised more than $100m in four venture rounds, is now open to consumers in 28 countries globally.  Coinbase suggested the announcement is reflective of what it called a welcoming environment for bitcoin in Singapore as well as the region's strong interest in the technology.  In statements, the company sought to further describe Singapore as a market where bitcoin had ""already gained traction"" among users including consumers, developers and traders.  David Farmer, international expansion lead at Coinbase, said:  “Singapore represents an important market for us. To date, more than 15,000 people in Singapore have signed up for a Coinbase wallet, and by extending our buy and sell service to the country, we’re helping to make their on-ramp to the bitcoin world as simple and as safe as possible moving forward.""  The news comes amid increasing signs that the industry is taking hold in the city-state, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore recently announcing it would invest in a blockchain initiative as part of a wider investment in financial technology.  The company did not comment as to whether its Singapore operations could allow it to expand to other Asian markets or how it would augment the service to appeal to a new demographic of users.  However, Coinbase is not without local competition in the market, as Singapore ranks 11th among global nations when it comes to investment in industry startups.  According to CoinDesk's Q2 State of Bitcoin report, $3.4m has so far been invested in startups in Singapore, with notable companies including CoinHako and Tembusu.

42398634,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdAsB,1441198866,BitFury Completes 16NM Bitcoin Mining ASIC Tape-Out,"BitFury has announced it has completed the tape-out for its 16NM ASIC bitcoin mining chips, which were first revealed to be in production in February.  The chip will achieve energy efficiency of 0.06 joules per gigahash, compared to the 0.2 joules per gigahash of its 28nm predecessor. BitFury suggested the chip will deliver ""four times the compute power"" of its previous 28NM chip.  The startup, which has so far raised $60m in VC financing, used the announcement to tout its commitment to green energy, the strength of its immersion cooling process and what it called an ability to compete in a ""new era"" of bitcoin mining, in which the total computing power of the network exceeds 1,000 petahash.  BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov said:  ""All told, BitFury is leading the development of environmentally-responsible infrastructure for the next chapter of the Internet based on the bitcoin protocol and blockchain technology.""  BitFury further suggested the new technology would likely be deployed in data centers that could be located in North America – a potential first for the company.  In the past, the company has faced criticism for basing its mining operations outside the US, though it has maintained it is primarily concerned with the cost of data center development in places where energy and building costs are beneficial.  The announcement comes amid a continued push for efficiency in the bitcoin mining space, following KnCMiner's June news that it had released the 16NM KnC Solar chip.

The company announced the outage at 20:22 UTC yesterday. By 03:02 it said the service was ""back up and running"", though it appears some site functionality – including user logins – is still problematic.  LocalBitcoins community manager 'Max' told Reddit the problem was related to the company's servers:  ""It seems a server got hung up ... We're about to move to new equipment as the current servers are quite old, sad that they had to crash before we moved.""    Two weeks ago, the Helsinki-based site announced upgrades to its servers that would log users out. It is unclear if the two events are linked.    Founded in 2012, the peer-to-peer marketplace matches local bitcoin buyers and sellers across 246 countries. Users have the option of transacting online or in person.
