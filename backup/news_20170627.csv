42400088,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzawK,1498591511,Bitcoin Exchange Operator Sentenced to Five-and-a-Half Years in Prison,"The former operator of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Coin.mx has been sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison.  The sentencing of Anthony Murgio comes months after he plead guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmission business in January. Murgio, along with alleged co-conspirator Yuri Lebedev, was first arrested and charged in the summer of 2015. Federal prosecutors later unveiled new charges against Murgio in November of that year  Coin.mx  was a Florida-based bitcoin exchange that federal prosecutors alleged acted as a financial conduit for the laundered proceeds of online criminal activity. The government sought as many as 10 years in jail for Murgio, a figure that the defense pushed back against earlier this month.  Ultimately, US District Judge Alison Nathan opted for a sentencing term of roughly half that amount.  Brian Klein of law firm Baker Marquart, one of the attorneys who represented Murgio, told CoinDesk in a statement:  “The judge dramatically departed from the government's requested sentence of over 10 years of prison time. Although we had hoped for an even lower sentence, we are pleased she made such a dramatic departure, and in so doing, we believe she validated points we raised in our sentencing submission and at the hearing today.”  The exchange was tied to a broader cybercrime scheme that infamously targeted companies like JPMorgan Chase, resulting in the theft of data from tens of millions of the bank's customers.  Another element of the case involved a New Jersey-based credit union, which prosecutors argued in court was used to transmit cybercrime-related funds overseas. That credit union was later shut down and its former chief executive was charged with aiding Coin.mx in exchange for accepting bribes.  According to a report from Bloomberg, a follow-up hearing is set for 1st September, with Murgio remaining out on bail.

42427638,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWwhh,1498584641,Asus Announces New Graphics Cards Focused on Cryptocurrency Mining,"One of the world's largest technology hardware makers has announced new graphics cards (GPUs) aimed at the cryptocurrency mining market.  Taiwan-based manufacturer Asus revaeled the Mining RX 470 and Mining P106, which were designed to handle the energy and heat intensive process of mining. Though not expressly pitched as such, the release is undoubtedly aimed at capturing some of the interest in mining ethereum. Bitcoin mining, by comparison, has evolved to a stage in which application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, are required to compete.  Cryptocurrency mining is a process by which new transaction blocks are added to the distributed network. When this happens, new blockchain tokens are introduced to the system and awarded to the miner as compensation – in this case, a profit is achieved when the cost of electricity and the operation itself is lower than the revenue generated by selling those tokens.  According to today's Asus announcement, the new cards are ""engineered especially for coin mining, positioning the products as capable of providing ""maximum mega hash rates at minimum cost"".  Interest in cryptocurrency mining has led to reported shortages of GPUs in the global market. One hobbyist miner recently told CoinDesk that local tech stores have run low on the cards, adding that online marketplaces like Newegg, Amazon and eBay, among others, are also largely out of stock.  It's a situation that echoes the earlier ""GPU rush"" from 2014, when mining activity around alternative cryptocurrencies like dogecoin and litecoin led to similar price increases and a decline in available inventory.  Shortages aside, ethereum network data suggests that more hash rate is coming into ply as time goes on.  According to etherchain.org, the mining difficulty – which rises as more hashing power is brought online – nearly tripled from 27th April to 27th June.  The RX 470 will be available worldwide, according to Asus, while the Mining P106 card will be available in China and Eastern Europe only, beginning in July.

Regional news source The Economic Times reports that the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are both exploring the use of the tech to digitally rework their land registries. In Telangana – with support from the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) – state officials are looking to apply blockchain to the revenue department as well.  Notably, the land registry project there – aimed at boosting transparency and reducing the incidence of document forgery – is expected to reach full production stage sometime in the next year.  In a similar capacity, across Telangana's southern border, Andhra Pradesh is also working to integrate the tech into its civil supply database.  According to the report, these databases store information of public subsidies and land records that often become targets of cyberattacks. Andhra Pradesh officials are said to be working with local startups in the country to build blockchain-powered services.  Recent statements from an Andhra Pradesh government official suggest that there are some potential barriers to further adoption, however.  NT Arunkumar, special representative for IT and Innovation for Andhra Pradesh's IT, took the stage during CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 blockchain conference last month.  During a panel appearance, he called for more collaboration between authorities, especially in cases where national boundaries are involved.

42427620,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWwDh,1498568451,The Risks of Segregated Witness: Possible Problems Under US Contract Law,"UPDATE 28th June 2017, 14:50 BST: This opinion piece has attracted a significant critical response. Critiques to its technical and legal presentations can be found here.      Jimmy Nguyen is chief intellectual property, communications and legal officer for nChain, a research and development firm focused on blockchain technology that is developing an alternative bitcoin software client.  In this opinion piece, Nguyen offers a critical take on the proposed SegWit scaling solution for bitcoin, arguing that the technical changes could raise legal issues under electronic contract law in the US and elsewhere.    -----For bitcoin, a vital question is how to increase the network's scalability to achieve faster transactions and greater use.    The Bitcoin Core development team's proposed scaling solution, called Segregated Witness (SegWit), would separate signature data (""witnesses"") from transaction data, and a new solution, Segwit2x, builds upon that proposal.  Most debate over SegWit centers on questions about technical impact and risks.  Given my legal background, I want to raise a significant risk that SegWit (if activated) will create in the legal system: by separating and discarding signature data, SegWit would make the legal proof and authentication of electronic contracts and transactions significantly more difficult.  This legal issue could create major practical problems in the business world.  If companies and individuals are moving to a world where they engage in electronic contracts and transactions on the bitcoin network, what happens if they cannot easily prove and authenticate those transactions later in cases of legal disputes or to satisfy regulatory compliance?  How SegWit separates signature data  Today, a standard bitcoin transaction records both transaction and signature data together, with the signatures accounting for approximately 60% of the data size.  The transaction data conveys what value is sent or information is recorded in the bitcoin transaction. The signature (witness) data is important because it verifies the persons involved, and authenticates that they in fact sent or received the transaction. But SegWit assumes that signature data is only needed when transactions are being validated, and can thereafter be discarded as unimportant.  Rather than directly raising the 1MB block size, SegWit would indirectly increase the block's capacity to store more transactions by separating the signature data from the transaction data. It then creates two hashes:  A ""regular"" hash of just the transaction data  A ""witness hash"" consisting of a hash both of the transaction data and the signature data.  How is this data stored in a block? The bitcoin protocol already uses a Merkle tree (a heretical data structure composed of hashes of information) to efficiently store transaction data, and places the Merkle root into the block header of every mined block. SegWit proposes creating a second Merkle tree to separately store the witness hashes, but does not keep the actual signature data.  As SegWit’s inventor Pieter Wuille explained, ""These signatures are only needed at time of validation."" Once a given transaction is validated contemporaneously, SegWit retains only the witness hash (in the second Merkle tree) and defaults to discarding the full digital signature.  While some nodes could elect to retain the full digital signatures, this creates three possible scenarios:  Some nodes in the network maintain digital signatures  No nodes maintain digital signatures  The majority of digital signatures will be discarded (the most likely scenario).  Consider how this would operate in the world of paper contracts. Once parties sign the hard copy of a contract, the signature block is cut off from the body (where the terms are written). The signature block is then converted to an identifier for indexing and that identifier is placed into a filing cabinet with hundreds of other signature identifiers. The actual signature block itself is discarded in most instances.  Years later, if you want to prove that you signed (or did not sign) a specific contract, you could find the signature block identifier, but you may not able to retrieve the physical signature block itself.  The end result of SegWit would be unreliability: you could find the witness hash, but it's not certain that you could find the digital signature.  Why signatures matter  In 1996, the American Bar Association reviewed the need for electronic signatures to facilitate online transactions. In its Digital Signature Guidelines, it identified two attributes that were key to replicating physical signatures in a digital environment:  Signer authentication: a digital signature should demonstrate who signed, and it should be difficult to reproduce by an unauthorized party  Document and transaction authentication: a digital signature should identify what is signed, to make it hard to falsify or alter the signed matter.  Most digital signature regimes, including the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) standards and eIDAS in the European Union, follow similar principles. Indeed, bitcoin's signature method satisfies these digital signature principles by using the public-private key approach to signing transactions.  The original bitcoin white paper (in section 2) even defines an electronic coin ""as a chain of digital signatures,"" and notes that a payee can ""verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership."" Thus, the bitcoin system relies on the ability of digital signatures for verification.  In contrast, SegWit favors transaction authentication over signer authentication, with little thought to the havoc this might cause when transactions are later disputed.  Implications under the e-SIGN Act  SegWit could make it very difficult for parties to a transaction or electronic contract to later prove its authenticity.  In the US, electronic contracts (and digital signatures) between businesses and consumers are generally valid under the federal e-SIGN Act. That law defines an ""electronic signature"" – a more flexible concept than a digital signature such as those used by bitcoin – to be something ""attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.""  This requirement provides the basis for authenticating that a contract has been signed and authorized by all parties, much like a physical signature on paper can be used to show later that the parties actually signed the contract.  But under SegWit, can it really be said that the electronic signature is ""attached to or logically associated with"" the transaction data in a manner sufficient to show intent to approve, given the segregated data trees and the possibility for signature data being discarded?  Moreover, the federal e-SIGN Act indicates the legal validity or enforceability of an electronic contract record ""may be denied if such electronic record is not in a form that is capable of being retained and accurately reproduced for later reference by all parties or persons who are entitled to retain the contract or other record.""  That is a key provision of the statute – an electronic contract may be denied validity or enforceability if it is not kept in a form that can be accurately reproduced later.  Yet, as we have seen, SegWit is not concerned with maintaining digital signatures, only with validating transactions as they occur. The SegWit approach creates significant uncertainty as to whether only a hash of signature data can meet the e-SIGN statutory requirements to prove a digital signature.  Thus, under SegWit, a business or consumer wishing to definitely prove a transaction could, at most, re-associate the witness hash with the corresponding transaction data. However, there will likely be no way to recover the digital signature itself, which means the electronic contract or record may be denied legal validity or enforceability under the e-SIGN Act.  Digital signatures could only be recovered if some node chose to retain all full signature data. Yet a node only has economic incentive to do so if it acts as a commercial archive service, charging fees to retrieve and authenticate full digital signatures. This would create a new form of intermediary needed for digital signatures, which is antithetical to bitcoin’s decentralized nature.  Implications under US state laws  Similar problems would arise under US state laws.  The vast majority of US states (47, plus the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands) have codified a version of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), which also recognizes that electronic transactions are valid.  Similar to the federal e-SIGN Act, the UETA defines an electronic signature as an ""electronic sound, symbol or process attached to or logically associated with a record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.""  New York state’s version goes even further, stating that an electronic signature is considered to be ""attached to or logically associated with an electronic record"" if the electronic signature is ""linked to the record during transmission and storage.""  But with SegWit not requiring the signature data to be transmitted and stored, a party seeking to repudiate a transaction might argue that SegWit signatures generally cannot meet the New York definition of an electronic signature.  The question of whether an ""electronic sound, symbol or process"" is ""attached to or logically associated with a record"" is often a complicated factual question.  For example, in Young vs Rose, an Arizona court of appeals explained that whether a ""thank you"" email sent in response to an email with an agreement attached was an ""electronic signature"" was not clear, and required a review of facts outside the court pleadings and the agreement.  SegWit threatens to further complicate this type of factual inquiry about what constitutes a satisfactory ""electronic signature.""  Certainly, laws can be updated to address these questions in a world of bitcoin transactions and contracts. For example, in March 2017, the state of Arizona passed legislation (HB 2417) to amend its version of the UETA to confirm that electronic signatures, records or contracts secured through blockchain technology are valid under the state law.  It also recognizes that smart contracts are valid. However, the law requires that qualifying blockchain technology be ""immutable and auditable and provides an uncensored truth."" In a SegWit world where signature data is pruned off, will blockchain records truly be auditable and provide an uncensored truth?  Furthermore, the Arizona bill does not address whether transactions, smart contracts or blockchain signatures must be recorded fully intact (with transaction and signature data together), or if they are no longer presumed valid if signature data is discarded.  If SegWit is activated, the validity of such contracts may become unclear under Arizona’s new law, as well as other state laws.  Facing the legal risks  Can the US legal system solve these problems? That's always possible, but law is always slow to catch up with transformative tech. And SegWit makes the challenges harder by pruning away a key element of any contract or transaction – embedded proof that the parties authorized the transaction to happen. Nor does it provide any easy mechanism for signature data to be “attached to or logically associated” later with transaction data.  That would contravene the US legal framework for electronic contracts, could scare businesses from operating more on the blockchain, and impedes the greater vision of a bitcoin network powering all kinds of transactions and smart contracts of the future.  This legal uncertainty is a significant risk of SegWit that bitcoin community members have not weighed – but definitely need to consider – before they decide whether to support SegWit (or Segwit2x).

Announced yesterday  via the project's public mailing list, the release effectively moves the software, one of several separate enterprise distributed ledger code bases being incubated under the Hyperledger umbrella, one step closer to a formal version 1.0 launch.  Jonathan Levi, founder of blockchain startup HACERA and a release manager for the project, sought to portray the announcement as a call to action to those seeking to leverage the software, framing it as evidence that Fabric is ""getting serious"" and moving steadily and pragmatically toward launch.  Levi explained the software is now entering a state in which it could be set live barring any significant issues with the code and documentation.  Levi told CoinDesk:  ""If you are heavily invested in proofs-of-concept, this is the right time to make sure that Fabric does what you need.""  The announcement also finds Hyperledger Fabric moving forward from a beta release, announced in June, that saw APIs and project code frozen as a method for testing the stability and usability of the software.  Going forward, Levi said the aim is for this release candidate to be thoroughly assessed by startups, enterprises and other potential users, so that they can best input feedback on the software development prior to its forthcoming launch.  Announced in December 2015, Hyperledger has so far signed up more than 130 members to its consortium effort.  Adding importance to the quality control push, however, is that the software is already being used by these members, which include some of the world's largest businesses as well as startups like HACERA.  In recent weeks, IBM has revealed it will use Hyperledger Fabric to power a trade finance platform for seven European banks, as well as a stock exchange pilot in South America – announcements that speak to the demand for future forthcoming versions of the software.

42427629,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWwRh,1498561253,ASIC on Blockchain: Australia's Securities Watchdog 'Unlikely' to Regulate ICOs,"Australia's top securities regulator believes central bank-issued cryptocurrencies could one day throttle illicit bitcoin use, and that initial coin offerings (ICOs) will remain largely outside the scope of global regulators.  In interview with CoinDesk, Greg Medcraft, chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), spoke openly about the state of blockchain technology and its impact on international regulators. Perhaps most notable are Medcraft's comments on the idea that centrally-issued cryptocurrencies present an attractive way to thwart illicit cryptocurrency use, a comment that came in response to questions about the rise of ransomware attacks leveraging the technology.  ""Depending on the type of centrally-issued digital currency, the ability to deal with the black economy and money laundering, etc, is dramatic,"" he told CoinDesk.  By replicating the utility of bitcoin as a payments channel within a centralized scheme, Medcraft said, there would be fewer non-nefarious reasons for individuals to use bitcoin or other decentralized currencies.  Medcraft explained:  ""I tend to think that will be the great motivator of the issuance of digital currencies by central banks, because it does allow you to deal with the abuse of things like bitcoin. The attraction to policymakers is probably going to be removing the anonymity part, which will be very attractive in terms of dealing with the black economy and money laundering.""  The ASIC chairman went on to emphasize that he still sees promise in bitcoin as a store of value and payment system, particularly in the developing world and in unstable monetary environments. Yet, he argued that underbanked populations in more developed nations would reap more benefit from centralized cryptocurrencies.  ""They could essentially change the landscape dramatically because they would allow for a pretty amazing revolution for the non-banked,"" he said. ""There would probably be a massive expansion around that, and it would change the shape of banks quite dramatically.""  In particular, he pointed to central banks experiments currently underway in Sweden, Singapore and Senegal as harbingers of what might become a global phenomenon in the coming years.  Under Medcraft's guidance, ASIC has become a leader in promoting the development and advancement of blockchain and fintech. It has cut red tape by offering waivers and exemptions to small businesses, and has offered clear guidance on the technology's usage. In March, the agency published an information sheet aimed at helping businesses discern whether their use of blockchain would bring them under ASIC's regulatory scope.  ICO uncertainty  Medcraft also responded to questions about so-called initial coin offerings, or public sales in which blockchain contracts are sold to investors as a means of fundraising.  Here, he noted that ASIC and other global securities regulators are closely tracking the rapid growth in ICOs, while admitting there are jurisdictional limitations as to how involved they can be at this time.  ""It's certainly on the radar. We're watching,"" Medcraft said, referring to his colleagues in the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the global association of securities and futures regulators.  ICO regulation is potentially a billion-dollar question for the cryptocurrency industry, but Medcraft said that the question of how they should be regulated is still up in the air, because many do not possess the characteristics of traditional securities and therefore fall outside the mandate of traditional securities regulators.  He said:  ""They’re a very interesting concept. An ICO is not equity – you're offering basically something that is the product of the entity that is doing the launch. You're taking a bet on getting that product early. How different is that if I go to Kickstarter and I buy something – a watch – and then I get that watch and sell it in the future? It's no different, is it?”  If securities regulators follow the same definitions and guidance they’ve previously used when approaching cryptocurrencies, Medcraft said, then ICOs, as they are typically structured, probably do not fall under their purview.  ""If we assume that our approach to cryptocurrencies is that they are a commodity as opposed to a currency, and we said that bitcoin is not a currency and therefore it's not a financial product, it seems to me that the product itself, strictly speaking, I don't think we would actually be regulating,"" he continued.  All in the structure  Yet, that's not to say there aren't instances where ASIC could be involved. It's just that to be officially deemed a security, an ICO token must be tied to certain financial obligations in the future.  He said:  ""To be classified as a security it would have to have some sort of financial conditions attached to it. Financial obligations have to be offered in relation to it, either it's equity or it's a debt-like instrument or principal instrument or a derivative on that.""  While only a handful of ICOs have launched in his jurisdiction, Medcraft said the ICO tokens that other securities regulators around the globe have looked at have generally fallen outside of this definition.  ""I think the ones they’ve looked at have been more cryptocurrency-type ICOs rather than debt or equity-like,"" he said.  Adding that his regulatory colleagues around the world remain largely in the information-gathering phase, he noted that tackling ICOs would be on the agenda of future IOSCO meetings.  Notably, the SEC is reportedly taking hard look into the recent explosion of ICOs, with a particular focus on investor protection.  Should Medcraft come across an ICO that does meet the criteria to be considered a security, he indicated ASIC's approach to regulating the offering would follow the same guidelines that it applies to any other financial instrument.  ""In principle, what we're looking for is that the consumer can have trust and confidence in what they’re buying, and that the risks are properly disclosed,"" he said.  He continued:  ""If [ICOs] do come within our mandate, we would essentially take a technology neutral approach and say, 'Alright, how can we get comfortable about the disclosure of the party issuing the coins? Have the risks been properly disclosed that are related to it? Are there particular conflicts of interests by the issuer?'""  Still, Medcraft also warned against any premature moves to regulate such offerings without a comprehensive understanding of their value propositions, the underlying technology and the benefits and risks to they pose to consumers and markets.  ""The important thing is that you don’t rush in and pre-bake stuff until you really have a clear view as to why the market needs to be regulated,"" he said, concluding:  ""I see this sort of stuff as market development. Our mandate is to make sure the markets can actually fund the real economy and therefore drive economic growth.""

The report grew out of a months-long process within the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which first revealed it was researching blockchain and its impact on the global financial system in February 2016. The board is composed of central bank governors and financial regulators from nations in the G20 group, as well as its predecessor Financial Stability Forum, and the European Commission.  Though the study states that ""there are currently no compelling financial stability risks from emerging fintech innovations,"" it outlines 10 potential issues that regulators should focus on. In the context of blockchain, the FSB report identifies the implications of the technology's cross-border nature and legal uncertainty around smart contracts.  The authors go on to note:  ""These and other legal issues could be even more prevalent when considering cross-border activities. For example, blockchain has raised questions, such as data privacy concerns across jurisdictions, and identifying the location of an asset when no one bank or entity is the custodian of the record.""  That said, the report also dives into the potential contributors to financial stability stemming from blockchain, including improved access to technology-driven financial services.  ""Innovations such as digital identity and DLT-based applications could support improved quality and accessibility of, or financial services for, end-users,"" the report's authors wrote.  Ultimately, the report itself doesn't call for any concrete policy recommendations on the regulatory front. Rather, it echoes other international bodies in its advocacy for greater cooperation between countries.

Given these figures, Bitspark and the UNDP are proposing a pilot that would enable migrant works and their families to send and receive payments via smartphone devices.  ""People are familiar to sending and receiving cash and this proposal seeks to streamline that process ... Instead of calling a taxi and handing over a bag of cash ... Bitspark's digital payments app Sendy [can be used] for instant, verifiable, trustless payments cash in cash out,"" the post reads.  For the UNDP, the proposal finds it building off efforts to use blockchain to better distribute aid to refugees, while embarking on a broader effort to find possible ways to improve UN operations with distributed ledger technologies.  Noting this mission, Bitspark concluded:  ""The application of new financial technologies like blockchain can assist in increasing the number of people with access to the financial system at less cost and at a scale necessary to make an impact and ultimately improving economic opportunities for people in Tajikistan and around the world.""

42427630,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWwPh,1498554098,Blockchain Payments Startup Veem Integrates with Intuit QuickBooks,"Intuit QuickBooks customers can now send international payments via blockchain payment provider Veem as an alternative to traditional wire transfers.  Announced yesterday at Money2020 Europe, the integration is aimed at helping accounting professionals streamline operations, while reducing fees. Veem claims users of the service will now be able to obtain such services at a reduced cost, as opposed to paying $40–$50 through alternative payments providers.  According to its website, the spread between buying and selling a currency via Veem ranges from 1.5% to 1.9%, based on the transaction size.  Users can currently send and receive money from 24 countries via the service, leveraging the ability to transact in multiple currencies. As reported by CoinDesk previously, Veem recently rebranded as part of a $24m Series B funding in March.  The move is also that latest that finds Intuit experimenting with how blockchain-based services could improve its product line.  As far back as 2014, Intuit has been experimenting with enabling merchants to leverage the bitcoin blockchain, first through R&D efforts and later adding Coinbase as a payment option for its merchant network.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase and Veem.
