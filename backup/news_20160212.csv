42398890,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8lG,1455312678,SEC Seeks $10 Million Default Judgment Against GAW Miners,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking more than $10m from the cryptocurrency mining firms GAW Miners and ZenMiner in connection with its ongoing securities fraud suit.  The agency filed suit against the firms and former CEO Homero Josh Garza in December. The SEC sought a motion for entry of default against the firms last month.  Garza and the companies are accused of defrauding investors, and operating a Ponzi scheme in connection with its now-defunct mining service by selling more mining power than it actually possessed.  The SEC argued in its motion for default judgment, filed on 12th February, that Hashlets – mining contracts sold by GAW in 2014 through an internal market it maintained – constitute securities under the Securities Act and Exchange Act.  The filing states:  ""The Commission respectfully requests that this court enter final judgment against defendants GAW Miners and ZenMiner and that that judgment permanently enjoin those entities from future securities law violations and order them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $10,384,099 and an appropriate third-tier civil penalty.""  The agency further alleged that GAW and ZenMiner made material misrepresentations to its customers, resulting in more than $19m in revenue tied to the sale of Hashlets. These sales, the SEC said, were buoyed by public statements made by Garza.  ""In addition, GAW Miners obtained money, in the form of additional Hashlet investments, as a result of public statements made by its CEO that the company knew or should have known were false,"" the agency said.  Notably, the SEC did not name Garza as one of the parties in the filing, in light of a recent court approval for an extension of time to response to the suit.  Marjorie Peerce, the defense attorney representing Garza, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Collapse fallout continues  GAW Miners collapsed last spring amid the market decline of its alternative cryptocurrency, paycoin, and growing scrutiny of its business practices.  At the time, the firm was sued by a Mississippi electrical utility that provided power to its mining operation in the state, a suit that ultimately resulted in a default judgment after GAW and Garza failed to respond.  Details of the SEC's investigation of GAW were first reported by bitcoin news blog Coin Fire. The company denied the existence of the suit, but information was disclosed following the release of GAW staff emails and, later, a lawsuit filed by the agency against Garza’s brother, who acted in a senior sales capacity for the company.

42398885,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8fM,1455307319,One of South Korea's Biggest Banks is Developing Blockchain Remittances,"South Korea's KB Kookmin Bank is developing a blockchain solution for international remittances with the aim of ushering in ""safer and faster"" foreign exchange services.  For the initiative, the commercial bank said it is partnering with local bitcoin startup Coinplug to utilise patents the firm holds in the field.  In statements, KB Kookmin Bank explained that banks currently send overseas remittances via the SWIFT network, which sends payments through an intermediary before they arrive at the beneficiary institution.  However, utilising blockchain technology avoids the intermediary, and could reduce costs and result in possible savings for the customer, the bank said.  A bank spokesperson remarked:  ""Blockchain technology is a new trend and we are trying to adopt this technology in a low level of data integrity platform. We are planning to escalate our services further to provide more secure and comfortable financial services for our customers.""  KB Kookmin Bank is the largest subsidiary of KP Financial group, which according to KB's 2014 annual report, it earned KRW 1.4tn ($1.16bn) in revenue from more than 30 million customers, an amount it estimates is more than half the population of Korea.  Blockchain verification  In the same announcement, Kookmin also announced plans to develop an ""overseas fund transfer and data storage service"" that can be used for verification when opening online bank accounts.  This new offering will also be based on distributed ledger technology, the bank said.  According to the company, the move follows a shift in stance by Korea's Financial Service Committee that has enabled online verification to be used for this purpose, a new policy it said aims to promote online financial services and encourage financial start-ups.  Coinplug provides Koreans with a variety of bitcoin services, such as in-store card schemes and digital currency purchases via standard ATMs. The company has closed a number of funding rounds which have raised at least $8m since late 2013.

42398886,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8iJ,1455303656,Ripple Settles $1 Million Lawsuit With Former Executive and Founder,"UPDATE (12th February 19:52 BST): This report has been updated with comment from Ripple.      A months-long legal dispute involving distributed ledger technology startup Ripple and its co-founder Jed McCaleb has come to an end.  Though the settlement was announced in an 11th February post on the main Ripple forums, the dispute dates back to last spring when digital currency exchange Bitstamp filed suit over dueling claims on nearly 100m XRP – the native token of the distributed Ripple network – an amount worth just over $1m when the suit was filed.  At the time, Ripple alleged that McCaleb had violated a 2014 agreement governing the sale of his XRP holdings, numbered at 9 billion tokens at the time. The startup further alleged that McCaleb, in conjunction with members of his family, sought to circumvent the agreement in order to sell the XRP beyond its contractual controls.  In turn, McCaleb disputed the allegation in court, and the case ultimately grew to include the Stellar Development Foundation, the organization overseeing work on the Stellar network, a fork of Ripple that McCaleb launched as a separate company and technology provider in July 2014.  According to the new agreement, Ripple has released all claims to the dispute XRP, and will pay legal fees incurred by Bitstamp during the proceedings.  The disputed funds, which were deposited with the US District Court for the Northern District of California during the course of the trial, will be released to Stellar.  As part of the settlement, McCaleb has sold his equity in Ripple, and has agreed to sale controls on 5.3bn XRP owned by him and his children. An additional 2bn XRP will be donated to an as-yet-undisclosed charitable fund.  The sale controls are tied to daily volume in XRP markets. For the first year, according to Ripple, McCaleb will be unable to sell more than 0.5% of average daily volume ""for each day of the week, including weekends and holidays"".  During the second and third years of the agreement, this amount grows to 0.75%, while it accounts for 1.0% in the fourth year. Beyond the fourth year, the amount is set to 1.5%.  ""The results of this settlement agreement show that I fully complied with the terms of the previous agreement. Personally, I am excited to see the conclusion of these baseless allegations,"" McCaleb wrote in a blog post following the announcement of the settlement.  In its announcement of the settlement, Ripple wrote that it was ""pleased"" with the outcome, going on to say:  ""It provides predictability and clarity about distribution of the largest individual holding of XRP in a way that fosters good health and growth in the Ripple ecosystem.""  Ripple, which declined to comment further when initially reached, later told CoinDesk in a statement: ""We think this is a positive development that allows all parties to move forward with final resolution.""

42398891,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8mF,1455300944,Nasdaq to Launch Blockchain Voting Trial for Estonian Stock Market,"Global stock market giant Nasdaq has announced it is developing an electronic shareholder voting system based on blockchain technology.  According to Nasdaq representatives, the trial marks the first steps in a project that would allow shareholders of companies listed on the Nasdaq OMX Tallinn Stock Exchange – Estonia's only regulated securities market – to more frequently participate in voting processes.  Currently, they suggested, these processes are out of touch with the needs of the market.  In comments to CoinDesk, officials connected to the project cited statistics that show shareholder engagement in public company voting is low, with roughly 1% of shareholders participating in acts of governance such as general meetings.  Representatives said Estonia’s market is ideal for testing the system, as Nasdaq will have access to investor data through the country's e-Residency platform, meaning it will be able to create voting accounts for users. They further cited the country’s love of IT innovation as a sign it would potentially gain support, and upon completion, wider use.  Nasdaq president Hans-Ole Jochumsen said in a statement:  ""Estonia’s robust information society and forward thinking coupled with the agility its size affords, creates a unique opportunity to premiere the e-voting pilot in Estonia.""  The announcement marks the company's second formal blockchain project, following the debut of Nasdaq Linq, a product that seeks to ease the issuance and management of shares in private companies, and that is currently open to a small group of initial test users.  Details scarce  Apart from the broad vision of the project, however, Nasdaq was not forthcoming with design details.  Company representatives did not disclose the type of blockchain technology they are seeking to leverage as part of the process, nor if they were engaging with any service providers from the industry on the trial.  Neither did they comment as to how any end product might look, though statements hint at the desired functionality for users.  For example, the representatives said the goal is for users to be able to identify themselves for purposes of shareholder voting from their home or office, suggesting there may be a mobile aspect to the project.  Today, they also expressed their belief that the company is using a platform which offers limited functionality due to the need for voters to be physically present, or otherwise appoint a proxy to facilitate this execution of their rights.  Nasdaq said it hopes to complete the project sometime in 2016.

42398889,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8jI,1455295716,UN Paper: Pushing Bitcoin for Third World Issues Can Be 'Techno Colonialism',"A new UN working paper argues that the bitcoin community has a tendency towards ""techno-colonial solutionism"" and ""techno-libertarian evangelism"" in proposing the digital currency as a solution to issues in the developing world.  Authored by independent researcher and consultant Brett Scott for the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, the paper provides a primer on the basics of bitcoin and discusses the technology’s potential applications for remittances, cooperative structures and micro-insurance systems.  However, it also flags potential ""points of concern and conflict"", such as a tendency for the bitcoin community to promote tech-from-above “solutionism”, and to ""evangelise"" libertarian political ideals.  By contrast, the paper further considers blockchain 2.0 technologies with ""more overtly communitarian ideals"" and their potential for creating “cooperation at scale”.  Disconnected from 'gritty social reality'  That cryptocurrency is based on collaborative open-source principles and peer-to-peer networks suggests a commitment to social solidarity and mutual aid, says Scott.  However, citing Yelowitz and Wilson's 2015 paper ""Characteristics of Bitcoin Users"", he says bitcoin’s image has become associated with ""speculators, profit-driven entrepreneurs, market-fundamentalist libertarians and technology fetishists"".  While bitcoin has been touted as a solution for the unbanked of the developing world, there remain doubts as to the viability of the digital currency within countries with limited access to internet services and infrastructure, he says.  Besides the issue of establishing trust in a poorly understood technology, bitcoin usage needs consistent availability of both Internet and electricity.  Scott concludes that, in not understanding these issues, the bitcoin community has ""little connection to the gritty social reality of many in poorer countries"".  He added:  ""The frequently aggressive rhetoric within the community, as well as the inequality of access and wealth within the system, seems – at first glance – to clash with the ideals of those in social and collaborative economy movements.""  Internet may not be a solution  Scott also takes the opportunity to offer a more political critique, saying that those that tout bitcoin as a ""life-raft currency"" seem to suggest that it is ""desirable to 'escape to the Internet' rather than seek more fundamental solutions to a country’s underlying problems on the ground"".  Advocating that the adoption of bitcoin by ""vulnerable"" nations is, at best, probably a short-term solution, he says it ""distracts countries from strengthening already fragile institutions"".  He goes on to write:  ""It is one thing to use bitcoin to provide a counter-power to the powerful cartels of banks in nations like the United States, but in a country like Zimbabwe the real need may be to strengthen the integrity of the banking system, something that can only be achieved by hard, long-term political battles.""  The author further cites the emergence of ""techno-libertarian evangelism"" and ""blockchain missionaries in developing countries articulating a technology-as-saviour and markets-as-saviour gospel alongside an anti-state message"".  Technology does not operate in a vacuum, he says, and similarly, bitcoin systems do not just ""descend on impoverished countries for the empowerment of all"".  Potential in some areas  Concluding, Scott concedes that there are potentially empowering uses of bitcoin and blockchain technology in certain contexts, yet he warns:  ""[W]hile the community around this technology is enthusiastic and experimental, it is still prone towards the elitist, tech-centric outlook of disruptive technology start-up culture.""  For the future, he suggests further research into how the technology could be implemented with sensitivity to the ""real struggles people face in implementing technology within diverse cultural and political contexts"".

42398888,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8gL,1455293838,Why Bitcoin Governance is a Competition (And That's a Good Thing),"A few weeks ago, in a post entitled, ""The Politics of Non-Political Money,"" I talked about the bitcoin block size debate as surfacing ""politics"" in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Important protocol and software development projects require people of disparate views and plans to come together over common standards and code. My thesis in that post was simply that good behavior is good politics because it builds credibility.  Some differ, and many – it should be no surprise – aren’t taking my advice. But the precedents set in the block size debate are important for the future of bitcoin, for other cryptocurrencies, and for similar projects that may offer alternatives to governmental monetary and administrative systems.  The politics are intense, there are ways that bitcoin governance is like government, and proposals to fork the software are kind of like constitutional amendments. But I'm increasingly comfortable thinking of bitcoin governance as a market phenomenon.  Specifically, groups with differing visions are competing to win the favor of bitcoin miners and nodes, so that their vision, if it prevails, can carry the bitcoin project forward.  Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, has stepped forward recently as a strong advocate for Bitcoin Classic and a 2MB block size. He cites four competitors to the current dominant coding team in this slide deck. Miners and nodes will choose one software version or another. It makes no difference whether we characterize their decisions as ""voting"" or ""buying.""  Bitcoin may have some of the strongest network effects possible because incompatible versions of the software won't recognize each others' blocks, transactions, or mined coins.  A miner on the ""minority"" side of a hard fork will mine bitcoins that are incompatible with the majority side, so those coins will be less useful and naturally worth less. And as more move to the majority side, ""minority"" coins will rapidly approach zero value, making switching a rational imperative, to be executed quickly.  These dynamics make for a ""winner-take-all"" bitcoin software market, and they make it very unlikely that bitcoin will ""split"". (The Verge isn’t the only news outlet to get things precisely wrong.) If a split were to happen, it would be because the cryptocurrency market was big and diverse enough for two coins, fairly seamless exchange among the two coins existed, or both of those things.  That would be a little more complicated, and it’s a little ways off, but it would be the opposite of fatal.  Coke vs Pepsi  Rancor aside, all of the things in the bitcoin world are as they should be. The virtuous incentives that are in place are part of bitcoin’s genius.  In saying all this, I don't think I’m breaking any new ground, and I may be stating the technical details imperfectly, but using a ""market"" frame of reference is different from the norm in open-source development. Open-source typically draws everyone together to work on a cooperative basis.  Many of the big, important open-source projects happen in standards bodies, or sometimes they operate under a benevolent dictator who makes the hard calls. And forks matter less.  A watchword in traditional open-source development is ""consensus,"" but that word does not offer a way to administer decision-making when there substantial, deep-running disagreement. It simply gives every participant a veto – and there are lots of vetoes out there right now.  Rather then hewing to a ""consensus"" norm and fretting about its violation, the competitors in the block size debate might think of themselves as competitors, like Coke and Pepsi. In product meetings and the boardroom, they might mutter oaths about your competition – ""Vile peddlers of swill they are!"" But publicly, they should be the cryptocurrency that refreshes or the bitcoin generation.  Their job is to code a great product and sell it. Probably with more merits arguments than slogans, of course. And some of the difficulty of this debate exists because customers—particularly many miners, but not only them—lack the technical and economic sophistication to know decisively what protocol and code they most want to run.  Cooperative open-source development has produced many incredible products, but the spur of competition is well known to wring the very best work from people. Platform competition and a winner-take-all market is no exception.  There are good arguments why bitcoin development should happen in the same way as most other open-source projects, I’m sure, but I’m inclined to prefer a level of antagonism and distrust among coding teams, because they will be the best watchdogs for the errors of each other.  Competition works. Markets are more decentralized than standards bodies.  Moving toward compromise  The choice is not one product or the other, of course, but among features such as block size limits.  Here the ""politics"" frame seems to serve well again. The dominant Bitcoin software provider, Core, could easily use a technique that US political parties use to undercut third parties: cooption.  When a third party appears to be gaining a foothold, stealing the lesser party's ideas is a perfectly legitimate method of dissipating its support. Failing to do so risks splitting the dominant party’s constituency, losing it votes and elections.  Bitcoin Core could pretty much kill off Bitcoin Classic by adopting the 2MB block size, and it could ensure its continued dominance. But that means withdrawing from what appears to be a rock-solid, imovable principle held by the Core team. Indeed, at times, certain writings have sounded like Core might conduct their own ""whiny ragequit"" if the Bitcoin block size changes.  Since I wrote about bitcoin’s ""politics,"" Core and its members have taken steps to be more communicative, which is great. One of the most recent communications is a conciliatory post from Matt Corallo characterizing the community as agreed upon a capacity increase in Bitcoin.  His post equivocates between a block size increase and the capacity increase available through Segregated Witness, a technique that debuted at the Hong Kong Scaling Bitcoin conference for sharply reducing the content blocks must include. But, by all appearances, this is a group working through the difficulties of compromise under growing pressure from a competitor.  Markets. Politics. Who knows? A little of both.  Learning from history  But I’ve recently been reviewing the history of the US Constitution and thinking in terms of parallels. When the Framers met in Philadelphia in 1787, they placed themselves under a strict rule of secrecy so that their deliberations could be orderly and frank.  They debated through the hot summer, and there was lots of give and take, even on principles of the highest order, such as the rights of certain classes of humans to life, liberty and property. Imperfect though it was, what emerged from the constitutional convention was, I think, the greatest charter for government yet devised.  The bitcoin block size debate is a little like that. While creating an incredibly valuable, fully decentralized monetary system, bitcoin and the blockchain may allow fully equal self-government across large swaths of human activity—a vast improvement on political democracy (credit: Samuel Patterson).  So it’s a debate of constitutional significance, and greater-than-constitutional proportion. The difference is that this debate is being held online in 2016. It's radically transparent, and authority to build this system of self-government is not reserved to the wealthy, well-educated, or well-connected.  It’s decentralized and available to all. So the bitcoin block size debate is just like the US Constitutional Convention of 1787, except it’s market-based – with trolls!

42398879,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8ZS,1455287726,ASX Details Blockchain Strategy in Financial Update,"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has revealed new details about its effort to innovate in the Australian equities market with blockchain technology.  The ASX is now actively working on a technology transformation programme that will employ blockchain (distributed ledger) technology to potentially replace its equities settlement systems.  In its half-yearly results, the group said it incurred AU$18.7m on capital expenditure during the period ending 31st December 2015, compared to $13m in the previous period.  That expenditure was primarily spent on the technology transformation program – which will see a replacement developed for the ASX's futures and cash market trading platform – as well as the enhanced risk management platform. These are expected to be completed during 2016.  The next phase of the exchange's technology transformation program will focus on its equity post-trade platforms based on blockchain tech.  Elmer Funke Kupper, ASX managing director and CEO, said in a statement:  ""We believe that distributed ledger technology has the potential to change the way our market operates end-to-end, reduce risk and costs for our clients, speed-up the settlement process for investors, and support new services for listed companies.""  Buying into blockchain  As part of that plan, the ASX invested in blockchain technology startup Digital Asset Holdings in late January.  The New York-based firm, which is led by ex-JPMorgan exec Blythe Masters, seeks to use private or permissioned blockchain technology to streamline financial processes such as syndicated loans.  Digital Asset recently also engaged with JPMorgan on a similar blockchain initiative that aims to make the trading process more efficient and cost effective.  The ASX said it has invested $14.9m to acquire a 5% stake in the company and fund an initial phase of development for its blockchain project.  ""The initial development will take place over the next six to 12 months and will bring to life the benefits and implications of a new post-trade solution for the Australian equity market. The development will take place alongside CHESS [the ASX's current Clearing House Electronic Subregister System], which will continue to operate as normal,"" the stock exchange said.  Both firms will engage with regulators and government agencies to ensure compliance with the regulatory, operational and security standards that apply in Australia’s financial markets.
