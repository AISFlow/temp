42398572,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbaDJk,1438898519,TØ Co-Founder Talks Overstock's Wall Street Strategy,"Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne brought new attention to potential applications for blockchain technology on Wall Street earlier this week when his company's long-awaited blockchain trading platform debuted at Nasdaq's New York headquarters on Tuesday.  The unveiling of tØ, covered by news outlets including Wired and The Wall Street Journal, was broadly focused on appealing to attendees with expansive rhetoric and a sweeping vision for how trading could be improved with blockchain technology while leaving some questions as to the market strategy and technical design of its products.  In a new interview, tØ co-founder John Tabacco opened up about the company's offerings and its working relationship with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's (ICBC) US capital markets division. At launch, he explained that tØ offers a private equities trading platform and a ""preborrow assured token"", with the goal of opening up its public equities trading platform pending regulatory approval.  Tabacco suggested more information on the collaboration with ICBC, the world's largest bank by total market cap, would potentially be forthcoming, but added new details to the record on this development:  ""ICBC is being very cooperative. They're some of the brightest and most innovative minds, and they're helping and assisting us as a correspondent clearing firm to have all the parts of our system automated and demonstrable for the regulators.""  Tabacco explained that tØ is using the blockchain and its in-house matching engine to transact ""digitized representations of existing legacy securities"".  ""We've married the traditional legacy systems for public securities to the crypto ledger and what we've done is automate a process where we can preborrow shares and know they are in our custody. They're untouchable to anyone else, and once we know they're in our custody, we will issue digital representations of that in the form of a token.""  Each token, he continued, equals 100 shares of a security that he emphasized would allow ""real-time price discovery"" upon wider use. Today, Tabacco said tØ's platform can borrow, segregate and create digital representations of shares.  Tabacco notably has a long and controversial history in securities lending, having been an outspoken critic of traditional practices in the industry in the wake of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Further, he has taken sometimes extreme means to voice his beliefs, starting an anti-Occupy Wall Street protest in 2011.  He perhaps best known, however, as the founder and CEO of Locatestock, an electronic platform for trading securities lending that sought to help users locate legal traders, experience he suggested makes him well-placed to help carry out Byrne's vision for the platform.  Private securities  To date, tØ's private equities trading platform is the company's most active proof of concept, as it recently faciliated the issuance of a $5m ""cryptobond"" to New York trading firm FNY Managed Accounts.  Tabacco explained the company's private and public securities platforms as ""similar products with significantly different regulatory hurdles"". Overall, he framed this initiative as comparable to an effort launched by Nasdaq to use the blockchain in its Nasdaq Private Market, an exchange for pre-IPO company shares.  ""We're trying to address an area of the market that is underserved if not unserved, in that private securities and people who invest in VC securities. They make an investment into a Series A round or Series B round with the hope of a public offering or otherwise that will offer liquidity and an exit,"" he explained.  He acknowledged that the product is also similar to one formerly offered by New York-based SecondMarket, which prior to 2011 had offered a pre-IPO securities marketplace. SecondMarket was notably founded by Barry Silbert, who has since become one of the most active venture capital investors in the bitcoin and blockchain industry.  ""I think SecondMarket was a fantastic innovation,"" Tabacco added. ""What we're doing at tØ is like SecondMarket 3.0.""  Building a private market  Tabacco declined to elaborate further on how tØ would seek to bring liquidity to its private market, a challenge SecondMarket cited in its decision to terminate its pre-IPO market. He did, however, explain how the pipeline for shares issuance is expected to work at scale.  ""What would happen is an issuer would come to us and contract with us to put together their offering documents, and we have broker-dealers who we've engaged for strategic relationships who can handle the subscription process KYC/AML,"" he said. ""The broker-dealer would handle the subscription process to see if they're a qualified buyer and institutional investor.""  The offering documents would be handled by Entrex, a capital market system with which Overstock has an established relationship.  Tabacco further cited its strategic relationships with FNY and brokerage-as-a-service provider DriveWealth as ones that would help drive interested participants to the new service and ensure participants are eligible to invest using its platform.  Public securities market  Tabacco suggested that the path toward the launch of a public version of this platform was less clear, but spoke at length about Byrne's vision for the system.  ""Patrick feels that retail investors are not fairly treated in the current capital market system,"" he said. ""There are multiple layers of intermediaries that add friction and cost.""  He explained that this version of the product would ""push past limits"" imposed on its private equities market, allowing a new class of investors the ""transparency and efficiency"" of its blockchain-based platform.  At issue is how regulatory agencies will allow consumers to engage with the platform, though Tabacco suggested the firm's legal efforts, spearheaded by Jones Day and Perkins Coie, were making headway on this goal.  ""The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been working with us and they're aware this is a novel idea and they want to know more about it. We've been granular in our explanations to them we want to make sure that the regulators regulate what they feel needs to be regulated,"" he said. ""We want to open tØ up to all investors.""  Preborrow assured token  In Byrne's speech, a particular emphasis was placed on the company's preborrow assured token, which was unveiled at the Tuesday event.  Building on this idea, Tabacco spoke out about a lack of transparency in the securities lending space, relating the developments in this part of the industry in terms of the financial crisis. Ultimately, regulators banned all methods of short selling stock following the event, allowing the excepting when stock was ""preborrowed"".  ""In the old days, if you wanted to short a stock, you'd call up a friend at another firm and say I'm shorting this stock and in three days I may need you to deliver it over to me, and you had to have reasonable grounds that that person would make good on his progress,"" he stated.  This reliance on verbal assurances, he suggested, meant in an instance where users defaulted on these products, many short sales were subsequently never settled.  Here, Tabacco reckoned that tØ would be able to solve a market inefficiency by taking the human element out of helping traders prove they are conducting short sales according to the rules.  ""What the blockchain gives us is the opportunity to basically segregate shares on every trade date, lock them in a segregated account where we know no one has access and create a digital representation of that in 100 share units,"" he remarked. ""The blockchain allows us to sell a digital token, which we're calling a preborrow assured token.""  Tabacco called his former venture Locatestock as a ""1.0 version"" of the preborrow assured token, which sought to use unique ID codes to establish records of such trading.  ""I think today most firms have a rudimentary internal messaging system that allows them to communicate where they believe shares may be available, and who they've given reasonable representation that they can lend it to them,"" he said, adding:  ""The innovation here is mind-boggling to people who understand it. There is a tremendous gap thanks to the lack of transparency in pricing for securities lending liquidity.""  Far-reaching implications  Tabacco suggested that, while a small innovation in the entire trading ecosystem, the impact of the use of the blockchain in this area would be beneficial to investors in pension plan and non-profit groups through endowments.  ""Using blockchain technology, we can zero in on a place in the market where there is no transparency so the good folks from say, the New York teachers' pension plan or city retirement system can benefit if their custodian chooses to use a securities lending strategy,"" he said.  TØ, he said, would ""level the playing field"" by allowing such entities to compete on the same plane as more established trading firms, who he says have better access to price discovery.  He said this might lead to better returns to those engaged in these types of trades.  ""Many of the US pension plans have been seeking anyway possible to enhance their returns, and by giving them an opportunity for them to access 1,000% price discovery, Patrick feels that we've created a product that will be greatly, greatly received by the retirement systems of America,"" he said, concluding:  ""If they're getting 40 cents and they should have got $10, this will have a significant impact.""

42378266,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgFF,1438889117,Market Research Giant Qualtrics Adds Bitcoin Reward Option,"Online survey giant Qualtrics has added bitcoin as a rewards option for consumers who respond to surveys and research requests issued by its enterprise clients.  The Utah company, which is valued north of $1bn following a $150m Series B in 2014, boasts more than 700 employees and investors including Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners. The offering was made possible by bitcoin payments processor SnapCard's recent integration with digital rewards platform Tango Card.  Consumers who want to access the platform to obtain rewards points must first sign up to the service to begin taking surveys. Once Qualtrics users earn 50 points for their participation, they receive a Tango Card gift code, which can then be redeemed for Amazon and Target gift cards as well as bitcoin.  Qualtrics head of strategy and research Mike Maughan indicated that by offering bitcoin as a rewards option, he believes the company's clients will be more easily able to reach the increasingly important millennial demographic.  Maughan told CoinDesk:  ""Millennials are most familiar with and most likely to be part of the bitcoin movement. A lot of millennials are more on the cutting edge of bitcoin, and those are among the people that are most sought after for their insights right now.""  Maughan went on to explain that Qualtrics saw little downside in adding the digital currency as a rewards option given that consumers have a choice of whether to redeem points for bitcoin.  ""It's not a compulsion,"" Maughan said. ""If they have any concern about bitcoin, they can then cash out for gift cards.""  With the decision, Qualtrics has become the latest company to offer bitcoin rewards through Tango Card, following last week's announcement by Microsoft's search engine product Bing.

42378265,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgGV,1438884620,G7 Pledged Support for 'Appropriate' Bitcoin Regulation at June Summit,"Representatives at a Group of Seven (G7) meeting in Germany this June announced support for ""appropriate regulation"" of virtual currencies.  A global organization comprised of the heads of state from some of the world's largest economies including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, the G7 met in Bavaria on 7th and 8th June.  According to the group's summit statement  , the G7 is looking to oversee digital currency activity through the lens of terrorism financing, which it deemed ""a major priority"". Part of this process, the statement read, includes regulating emerging payment methods.  The group stated:  ""We will take further actions to ensure greater transparency of all financial flows, including through an appropriate regulation of virtual currencies and other new payment methods.""  The group pledged its support to the efforts of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which in late June recommended that digital currency exchanges be monitored and required to hold licensure prior to operation. The G7 also indicated that it would be ""actively contributing"" to efforts to develop and deploy oversight standards.  ""We will strive to ensure an effective implementation of FATF standards, including through a robust followup process,"" the group said.

A recent CoinDesk study of bitcoin users highlighted the lack of diversity in the digital currency space, with fewer than one in 10 bitcoin owners (8.2%) stating they were female, and over 72% describing their ethnicity as “white”.  The Media Lab's DCI will work with local groups like Girls Who Code, the Microsoft-sponsored TEALS programme, CODE2040 and the National Center for Women and Information Technology to encourage applications for the scholarships.  Consensus Scholars will attend the digital currency summit on 10th September in New York City and a mentorship session with leaders in the industry. Mentors will be drawn from the high-level technologists, financial executives, public-sector officials, global aid workers and entrepreneurs speaking at the event.  “Our hope is to expose more young people, from a diverse set of backgrounds to the powerful potential of digital currency. The Consensus Scholarships will allow young people to ask questions, gain unique insights and meet with leaders in the digital currency movement,” said Brian Forde, director of the Media Lab’s DCI.

42378261,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgAD,1438862295,Tokyo Court: Bitcoin Not Subject to Ownership,"Tokyo's District Court has ruled that bitcoin is ""not subject to ownership"", with a judge informing a plaintiff he could not claim for bitcoins lost in the Mt Gox collapse.  Judge Masumi Kurachi stated that, due to their intangible nature and reliance on third parties, bitcoins cannot be covered under existing law.  Kurachi's comments, reported by The Japan Times, came during a lawsuit bought against bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt Gox by an unnamed Kyoto resident.  Representing himself in court, the plaintiff had demanded repayment of 458 bitcoins, today worth $128,144, that were held in his account when the exchange shuttered last year.  It is unclear what impact this ruling will have on other Mt Gox claimants, as thousands of creditors undergo a lengthy process to divide up the exchange's remaining assets, last valued at $11.5m.  They've been told by Payward CEO Jesse Powell, who is assisting the claims process, to expect only a fraction of their original funds back.  Vanishing act  Once the biggest bitcoin exchange in the world, Mt Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan and the US in February 2014 after claiming 750,000 BTC had vanished from its customer wallets.  Though CEO Mark Karpeles maintains the missing coins were targeted by hackers following a transaction malleability bug, others suggest evidence points to insider involvement.  Five days ago, Karpeles was arrested by Tokyo Metropolitan Police on suspicion of manipulating trades on the exchange and misappropriating customer funds.  A police official at the arrest said some of the lost bitcoins may have never existed. Unofficial reports even claim the exchange ran out of money six months before its collapse.  In an Reddit AMA on Saturday, a user claiming to be the first employee of Mt Gox, Ashley Barr, claimed his statement – alongside other ex-colleagues – had lead to the arrest:  ""We learned that Mark only had one bank account, shared with Mt Gox's customer deposits. That was the nail in the coffin.""  The 30-year-old denies the allegations against him.

42378279,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7YgVb,1438856922,Inside Barcelona's Bitcoin Drug Lab,"At the headquarters of Energy Control in Barcelona, Northern Spain, a nondescript envelope arrives. Hidden inside, between layers of cardboard and tape, are two fluorescent pink pills purchased from one of many eBay-style marketplaces on the dark web.  For €50-worth of bitcoin, the non-profit provides anyone in the world with a breakdown of the substances contained in their drugs – and the quantity – no questions asked.  Energy Control has been carrying out drug checking in raves and at its labs since 1998. Its dark web service, introduced in April 2014, operates under the same premise: to reduce harm among users by arming them with facts.  The idea for the project can be traced back to a family physician named Fernando Caudevilla, commonly known as Dr X. Following his first post to the Silk Road forum in April 2013, six months before the market's FBI shutdown, he became a trusted source of guidance on drug safety across many dark markets.  Up until this point, Energy Control, which is over 90% government funded, had only offered services inside Spain. However, Caudevilla – who has worked with the organisation since 2000 – saw the potential for a drug checking service for the dark web – completely anonymous, of course.  Mireia Ventura, Energy Control's drug checking co-ordinator, who took over the project now Caudevilla has moved up the ranks of the organisation, explained:  ""We wanted to be inside of the dark web with this type of strategy because we really believe that it is necessary for risk reduction inside there.""  While there are other harm reduction projects, such as Wedinos in Wales and DanceSafe's DIY testing kits, nothing matches the scale and speed of Energy Control – which aims to return users' results in seven to ten days.  Running costs  Ventura says her lab receives between five and 10 deliveries a week from drug users as far afield as Australia, China and the US.  The service doesn't come cheap. Ventura's lab was gifted its first machine – a liquid chromatograph – by a donor. However, it is still paying off the high-spec gas chromatograph it bought specifically for its international testing. Ventura estimates this may take up to six years.  ""You need a lot of money to maintain these machines during the year because you need to pay maintenance contracts to make sure if you have a problem you have a technician to solve it in two or three days.""  Timing is also crucial. While samples may only take 30 minutes to process on average, there is often a large backlog – with the machine running non-stop Monday evening to Sunday evening.  ""Depending on the substance, you need to do further analysis. For example, for LSD it is necessary to use liquid chromatography to quantify the exact amount of LSD,"" Ventura said.  The backlog is also due to the rising number of new substances the lab is seeing, last year 266 samples it processed were found to be new psychoactive substances, also known as 'legal highs'.  Delays also mean people are more likely to take risks, which is an added problem with the influx of new adulterants, such as the anaesthetic metoxetamine, and entirely new substances – such as 'date rape' drug Scopolamine – the lab is seeing.  Bitcoin's grey area  Energy Control does accept funds via bank transfer and PayPal, however national coordinator Núria Calzada said bitcoin – the de facto currency of the dark web – is by far the most popular payment method for its privacy-conscious users.  Since its inception in April 2014, the project's bitcoin proceeds haven't moved from the Blockchain wallet owned by Energy Control.  The notoriously volatile currency that it is, bitcoin has halved in value within that time.  It's not that Energy Control doesn't want to access the funds, Calzada said, but the regulatory uncertainty around bitcoin is a ""headache"" for its parent organisation, ABD, which values transparency above all else.  ""As an NGO you have to justify everything. You have laws to follow and lot of regulation and so on ... It [bitcoin] is very difficult to justify financially for the audits.""  Calzada said Energy Control was likely the first NGO is Spain to use the cryptocurrency, with another ""to do with kids and clowns"" also in the mix.  Spain has issued little official guidance on cyptocurrencies such as bitcoin to date, which means handling the cryptocurrency in a business capacity requires a lot of guesswork on issues such as VAT.  Despite bitcoin's grey area, Ventura said the project has strong ties with the government, acting as eyes on the ground for the Ministry of Health and further up the chain in Europe.  ""The thing is that we have their respect and we are really very important for them for identifying all the new substances and all the new trends,"" she said.  Driving purity  The service is vital to check not only the kinds of adulterants present in the sample but also the dosage of the drugs.  Just as strains of marijuana have been getting progressively stronger, the EMCDDA and Europol have issued an alert warning of health risks linked to the consumption of very high-purity MDMA products.  In Energy Control's 2014 annual report, released this month, the organisation revealed the three most common street drugs, MDMA, speed and cocaine, were at their highest purity in the last five years.  In fact, 84% of the MDMA samples the lab received were pure crystal. This, Calzada told a press conference, could be a result of the eBay-style seller ratings on the Deep Web, where sellers face public scores on their quality and service.  Ventura said:  ""I think the best example is cocaine, here in the street sometimes it's difficult to find cocaine without adulterants and in the dark web it's the most frequent result.""  ""In the street level there are a lot of hands moving that cocaine so it's easier to polute and add other substances,"" she added.  Professor Fiona Measham, an expert in UK drug trends, told the Guardian last year she had witnessed nine MDMA-related cardiac arrests at one festival alone due to the strength of the drug.  Quality control  Due to the small sample size Energy Control takes – between 30 and 100mg – it is not always possible to detect all substances that might be present in the larger batch that particular sample came from. Ventura said:  ""Our system is not a quality control, that's for sure. We are always repeating this message. If a vendor has a kilo we cannot assure that the samples which we tested are the same.""  ""We advise that this is a validation of this sample and not the validation of the dealer that sells this sample. We certificate sample to sample, not a batch or vendor,"" she added.  But are sellers using this purity rating as a stamp of approval from the lab? Nathan Jessop, an analyst at Elliptic who specialises in dark markets, said in his experience this isn't a standard practise:  ""Sellers sometimes publish this [the rating] on their vendor pages. Although, this is rare and there is nothing to stop sellers falsifying this information.""  Alongside feedback ratings, sellers are far more likely to promote their products via reviews on the so-called 'clearnet' via forums such as Reddit, he said.  Affiliate marketing – a term to describe customer referral schemes – and banner ads are also in play on sites like Grams, the 'Google' of the dark net.  ""If vendors are using our service ... they are not in our target group but we think that there is a type of risk reduction. But we don't want them to use our name as validation,"" Ventura said.  Bigger and bolder  Since Silk Road, the dark web – accessible via anonymous browser Tor – has been populated by marketplaces offering a smorgasbord of drugs in exchange for bitcoin. Statistics suggest they are both bigger and bolder since Silk Road's demise.  Academics  have made the case that, by reducing the amount of face-to-face interaction down the supply chain, dark web marketplaces have reduced drug-related violence, for example territorial disputes between low-level dealers.  The judge in Ross Ulbricht’s trial, Katherine Forrest, dismissed this as an argument of privilege, describing the site and Caudevilla's role in it as ""breathtakingly irresponsible"".  Families of two young men who died after ingesting substances from the marketplace, including Australian Preston Bridge, testified to Forrest that Ulbricht should be held responsible for their deaths.  ""Ulbricht’s plan was not simply a plot to disintermediate local drug dealers. It was Ross Ulbricht’s plan to rapidly expand the market for illicit drugs, and in the process, dramatically enrich himself without any regard for the lives of others,"" wrote the father of ‘Brian B’, a 25-year-old who died after overdosing on Silk Road heroin.  Forrest would later hand down a sentence of life in prison.    While some argue the best way of avoiding the fate of Bridge and Brian B is to steer clear of drugs altogether, the people behind Energy Control realise not everyone will do so. There will always be people who want to take drugs, and Energy Control seeks to make it that little bit safer for those who do.
