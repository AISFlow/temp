In a March 19 update to its FAQ on sanctions compliance, the department's Office of Foreign Assets Control notes that cryptocurrencies are treated the same as fiat currencies when it comes to Specially Designated Nationals ‚Äì a list of people affiliated with the governments of sanctioned nations, terrorist organizations or narcotics trafficking.  ""To strengthen our efforts to combat the illicit use of digital currency transactions under our existing authorities, OFAC may include as identifiers on the SDN List specific digital currency addresses associated with blocked persons,"" the agency said.  Doing so would ""alert the public of specific digital currency identifiers associated with a blocked person,"" OFAC said. However, the address listings ""are not likely to be exhaustive.""  The regulator advised:  ‚ÄúParties who identify digital currency identifiers or wallets that they believe are owned by, or otherwise associated with, an SDN and hold such property should take the necessary steps to block the relevant digital currency and file a report with OFAC that includes information about the wallet‚Äôs or address‚Äôs ownership, and any other relevant details.‚Äù  OFAC even indicated there would be a field on the SDN list for digital currency addresses, with room for up to 256 alphanumeric characters and the name or ticker of the currency (it listed as examples bitcoin, ether, litecoin, neo, dash, XRP, iota, monero and Venezuela's petro).  Marco Santori, president of wallet startup Blockchain.com and a longtime industry lawyer, tweeted that the move was ""good news"" for bitcoin in a broad sense, though he said it may have some unintended consequences:    This could create perverse incentives to use @zcashco or other privacy coins: Presumably OFAC will be able to ID bitcoin and non-private blockchain addresses but not private ones. Therefore, companies for whom it's difficult to comply will just support private chains instead.        ‚Äî Marco Santori (@msantoriESQ) March 21, 2018      The update came the same day U.S. president Donald Trump issued new sanctions against Venezuela after the latter launched the petro.

Members of the Chelan County Public Utility District (PUD)'s board of commissioners¬†voted unanimously to stop reviewing applications for mining facilities and similar data research projects on Monday, following a review of the current impact by existing operations. Chelan County has some of the lowest electric costs in the nation thanks to its hydropower resources, making it attractive to cryptocurrency mining companies, as previously reported.  The current load from the operations already set up are beginning to impact the county‚Äôs overall electric grid capacity, said General Manager Steve Wright, according to the release. This is resulting in public health and safety concerns, as well as possible threats to the district‚Äôs planned growth.  ""Rogue cryptocurrency operations"" are also taking power which the county could be using elsewhere, according to the release.  Commissioner Randy Smith said in a statement:  ""We do need time to take a deep breath and work through the issues and this may be the best approach.""  There will be a public hearing on the moratorium on May 14. Before the moratorium can be lifted, PUD staff members will review the cost carried by mining operations, the consequences for unauthorized firms, and establish how best to serve the unique demands of the industry.  The moratorium comes days after the city of Plattsburgh in upstate New York implemented a similar measure. Plattsburgh officials also cited the power demands commercial mining operations produce, noting that it had caused residents‚Äô electricity bills to spike.

Firoz Patel received a three-year sentence, while Ferhan received an 18-month sentence. The Department of Justice's press release was changed to remove references and allegations related to child pornography.      Digital payment processor Payza has been charged by the U.S. government with running an unlicensed money services business.      One of the founders of the firm, Ferhan Patel, has been arrested, while his brother, co-founder Firoz Patel, remains at large. On Tuesday, the Department of Justice unveiled the charges and accused the Patels and Pazya of facilitating as much as $250 million in money laundering on behalf of Ponzi schemes and child pornography sites, among other enterprises.      The court filing lists several charges: conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, conspiracy to launder money, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business in the District of Columbia.    While the government's statements and accompanying indictment make no mention of cryptocurrencies, the firm has been operating in the space for some time, offering buys and sells of bitcoin since 2014. The company expanded to other cryptocurrencies last year, when it said in a press release that it would offer exchange services for XRP and ethereum, among others, and more recently announcedhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/payza-partners-with-blockcypher-to-launch-dash-cryptocurrency-payments-300615602.html that it was integrating dash.    Per the U.S. government's court filing, which was released Tuesday but is dated Nov. 3, 2016, the Patels ""operated a money transmitting business that operated without the necessary state licenses and knowingly transmitted funds that were derived from illegal activity.""      ""Defendants ... knew that many of co-conspirator Payza's customers transmitted criminally derived proceeds via co-conspirator Payza. The transmission of these funds promoted the continuation and operation of these underlying criminal schemes,"" the filing states. All told, Payza allegedly transmitted more than $250 million over the course of six years.      The filings also make mention of two other firms, AlertPay and EgoPay, which the Patels were said to have owned and managed. EgoPay froze customer funds in early 2015, later claiming that it had been the target of a hack. The service closed down that year, as noted in the Department of Justice's document.      Court documents indicate that Ferhan Patel was arrested in Michigan and will be transported to Washington, D.C.

42428694,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdVbh,1521659157,Startup EverMarkets Aims to Shake Up Futures Trading With Blockchain,"Blockchain startup EverMarkets wants to take away Wall Street's edge in the crypto futures trading market.  The company announced today that it is building a blockchain-based trading platform that will aim to support the peer-to-peer trading of futures contracts on both ""real-world"" and crypto assets. It will also allow users to utilize cryptocurrency to post collateral, pay fees and settle contracts.  ""It's akin to what bitcoin has done, peer-to-peer transfer of funds,"" EverMarkets CEO and Co-founder Jim Bai told CoinDesk in an interview, adding:  ""We're trying to create a market where we can disintermediate some of these centralized players and allow for a peer-to-peer trading of futures.""  Major financial markets companies CME Group and Cboe Global Markets¬†initiated bitcoin futures trading in December of 2017.  But unlike these traditional platforms, which according to Bai reward speedy trading, the EverMarkets Exchange (EMX) will operate an auction system that will collect all buy and sell offers, then match them according to price and size within several minutes.  In this way, the system is intended to level the playing field between regular traders and high-frequency traders employed by hedge funds.  Likewise, Bai claims it could also reduce volatility in the marketplace and create a more equitable means of price discovery.  The platform's design has earned the EverMarkets team comparisons to the protagonists of Michael Lewis' 2014 book ""Flash Boys.""  Lewis examined high-frequency trading in the U.S. equity market and told the story of trader Brad Katsuyama's Investor's Exchange (IEX) - also intended to create fairer trading, but with stocks rather than futures contracts.  Bai, a former futures/options trader for Citigroup and Graham Capital, agreed that there are similarities between EverMarkets and IEX.  ""We've gained a lot of inspiration from what they've done at IEX ‚Äì and they are also trying to disincentivize speed in the marketplace.""  Traders of the EMX platform will carry out transactions with ERC-20 tokens that can also be withdrawn into a private wallet, avoiding ""lengthy approvals or a prolonged waiting period,"" and can also act as collateral.  Bai told CoinDesk that company hopes to work with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to become a licensed exchange, and that it plans to primarily court institutional clients in addition to crypto traders.  More broadly, the EverMarkets founders envision their exchange as contributing to the maturation of the crypto industry. Bai commented,  ""This will really help legitimize the use case for crypto, so people can buy it not just for a store of value, but they can actually use it and put it to work.""  The company also announced on Wednesday that traders will soon be able to test the platform in a pilot that's set to take place within the next several months.  Bai estimated that the public version of the platform would be released during the second half of 2018.  The founders also include¬†Mark Pimentel, the president and a former quant trader and market-maker at Citadel and Knight Capital, and Craig Austin, chief technology officer and a former head of asset allocation research engineering at AQ.

In an interview with¬†The Times¬†published Wednesday, Dorsey, himself a noted bitcoin investor, said he believes the cryptocurrency will take over the U.S. dollar's dominant place in world finance and become the primary global currency for payments.  Suggesting the shift could happen in 10 years or perhaps less, the entrepreneur said:  ""The world ultimately will have a single currency, the internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be bitcoin.‚Äù  While conceding that bitcoin is faced with scaling issues right now, making it ""slow and costly,"" Dorsey nonetheless argued that new solutions will ease that difficulty in the end.  ‚ÄúAs more and more people have it, those things go away. There are newer technologies that build off of blockchain and make it more approachable,‚Äù he said.  In fact, Dorsey is putting his money where his mouth is in an effort to bring about faster, cheaper bitcoin transactions.  Last week, CoinDesk¬†reported that Dorsey had participated in a funding round that raised $2.5 million for¬†Lightning Labs. The startup has notably just launched its beta version of the Lightning Network, a protocol layer built above the bitcoin blockchain to speed up the transaction process, as well as lower fees.  The investment followed Square's¬†trial, announced last November, which allowed limited users to buy and sell bitcoin over its payment application, Cash App.  Following the test, Square is now offering the bitcoin service in the U.S. state of Wyoming, and is reportedly seeking for a so-called ""BitLicense"" to extend the option to New York.

In a data report released¬†Wednesday, the government agency said the number of blockchain patent applications from the five most advanced countries and regions ‚Äì the U.S., EU, China, Japan and South Korea ‚Äì totalled 1,248 in 2017.  Although the number may not be as high as those seen in other fields of industry, the KIPO drew attention to the notable growth rate of blockchain applications in recent years.  In comparison, the agency indicated that the yearly filing totals from 2013 to 2016 were 27, 98, 258 and 594, respectively. Combined, that's less than the applications filed in 2017 alone.  Also notably, there's a significant skew towards the U.S. and China, with data showing that the two nations account for 78 percent of all the 1,248 applications last year.  While the KIPO did not disclose the exact breakdown for each country, it said the U.S. currently ranks first in cumulative numbers. China, though, has been surpassing the U.S. since 2016 in annual patent applications.  ""It is expected that China will take the first place in cumulative number of cases soon,"" the report states.  Also apparent in the data, is that the U.S. is seeing keen patenting efforts from major financial institutions such as banks, which lend a 16.3 percent weight to the country's filings in total.

42428687,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdVLh,1521640822,Ethereum and Stellar? Kik's Kin Token to Use Two Chains,"One crypto token on two different blockchains?  While it might sound unlikely, social messaging app Kik has announced it'll be doing just that with its ""kin"" token, which allowed the company to raise $98 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in September. After some back and forth about which blockchain the company wanted to host its crypto token on, Kik has decided to use ethereum (on which the tokens were first launched) for liquidity and stellar for transactions.  The decision comes only a few months after CoinDesk reported that Kik was thinking about moving its crypto token fully off ethereum and onto stellar due to high transaction fees and slow confirmation times plaguing the ethereum network.  At the time,¬†Kik CEO Ted Livingston referred to the ethereum as ""the dial-up era of blockchain,"" but today the company has pulled back a bit from its complaints about the second largest blockchain by market capitalization.  As such, users can imagine their kin token being split into two equal parts ‚Äì one that runs on stellar and one that runs on ethereum. Using¬†atomic swaps, an in-progress technology that allows cryptocurrencies to be traded across blockchains, the company will lock up a kin token's stellar half when its ERC-20 (the ethereum standard for crypto tokens) half leaves the app, and vice versa.  ""Creating a bi-directional blockchain with stellar will drive mass adoption of kin by providing faster confirmation times, low transaction fees and scalability,‚Äù Livingston said in a press release.  Stellar founder Jed McCaleb seconded that, telling CoinDesk:  ""Kik will be one of the first mainstream projects that uses cryptocurrencies in a meaningful way. It will bring millions more people to this technology and we are super excited to be the platform this will be done on.""  As previously reported, Kik saw participation from 10,000 people in 117 countries in its token sale. By popularity, the messaging app ranks No. 15 on Mac iOS in the social networking category and No. 14 on Android in the communication category, according to SimilarWeb, a third-party app usage tracker.  For Kik, the crypto token is about allowing users of its platform to purchase digital goods and in the future, even physical goods more easily, and according to many industry stakeholders, the launch of kin will be an early test of whether this pans out.  ""Users that have a medium of exchange do have a better user experience overall,"" Tanner Philp, director of corporate development at Kik, said.  Lock it down  To make this two blockchain system work, Kik is employing atomic swaps, a technology that's been a hot topic this year as developers look for ways to make it easier for users to trade tokens across blockchains.  The technology involves basically locking tokens on one network and creating tokens on the other. As such, every ERC-20 kin token ‚Äì the total supply is 10 trillion tokens ‚Äì that Kik created in its ICO will have a corresponding stellar token.  If some of those ERC-20 kin tokens never make it to the Kin app, the equivalent amount of stellar kin tokens will never be unlocked, either. In that way, the new stellar tokens should not have an effect on kin's price.  Yet, committed to using whichever blockchain is the best, Philp said, kin could be moved fully back onto the ethereum blockchain should the protocol scale up.  He told CoinDesk:  ""There's the flexibility to use the best protocol that's available.""  But at this point, according to McCaleb, the stellar protocol was specifically designed to represent non-native assets and conduct exchanges with other protocols, ""so it is¬†super fast and efficient."" Plus, stellar is in the middle of implementing Lightning Network, which moves transactions into payment channels off-chain and is touted as a way to scale blockchains without increasing the burden or fees.  Yet, both Philp and McCaleb said current demand for kin transactions ‚Äì a report from January showed that 18,000 crypto transactions were made (either through earning kin through surveys or spending it on sticker packs) during the initial product tests ‚Äì should be no problem for Stellar to handle as it's built today.  Beyond stickers  As mentioned, currently select Kik users can earn and spend kin tokens, the latter only on sticker packs or digital art that people can use within chats, so far.  But Kik expects more digital and even physical content will be available in the future.¬†For instance, eventually, there could be games, private chats and/or collectable digital art (along the lines of CryptoKitties). And on the physical goods side, sunglasses manufacturer Shivas announced in February that it¬†would accept kin as payment.  Although, scaling challenges have prevented Kik itself from developing more complex applications for the token so far.  While Kik's crypto token wallet is available for use, it doesn't activate beyond a preview until kin is loaded into it for the first time. According to Philp, the company has opted not to draw too much attention to the new feature as it works through technical limitations.  Still, Philp said, ""We're going to continue to develop more experiences on the platform to act as a lighthouse.""  Kik has committed to complete integration by the second or third quarter of 2018, which will take place in two phases. First, 900 billion stellar-based kin tokens will go live that Kik users can earn and spend, then during the second phase, users will be able to move those stellar kin tokens off the Kik app to create ERC-20 kin tokens, which can be traded on secondary markets for other cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens.  Summing up his thoughts on what kin tokens will eventually provide for the messaging app, Philp concluded:  ""Overall we see that Kin is a great force multiplier as a strong product experience for users in these experience driven digital service.""

Asia's Token Economy Is Charging Full Speed Ahead,"Far East dealers in crypto assets have been on the receiving end of severe regulation and yet the region appears undaunted ‚Äì at least, that's if the Token 2049 Hong Kong conference is any indication.  Indeed, at day one of the event Tuesday, there wasn't much evidence of the so-called ‚Äúcrypto winter‚Äù being mooted in the west. In fact, China‚Äôs ‚Äútokenomics‚Äù movement appears to be in good health, even with the¬†outright ban on ICOs and trading on exchanges.  That's not to say that the market hasn't been affected, though.  On the contrary, one of the big concerns the Chinese government had about ICOs to begin with was the ease with which crypto tokens might facilitate money laundering, and since the ban, there's been a lot of underground, modified ICO activity in China, said Jack Lu, founder and CEO of Wanchain.  ‚ÄúIt may have increased tenfold since the ban,‚Äù he said.  According to Lu, the result is that China now has a credibility crisis. While the government recognizes that blockchain technology in some form or other could provide a solution, it is left with a proliferation of the very activity it intended to stamp out.  How all this plays out is anyone's guess. But blockchain technology in the form of private, tokenless deployments is welcome in China, said Lu, whose firm is working on interoperability between such networks.  Then there‚Äôs the large amount of money and effort that Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have channelled into the blockchain space. Lu even went so far as to mull a future where the two trends might have come to a head.  He asked:  ""Then there is traditional enterprise, private blockchain space ‚Äì will the two cross over and come together at some point?""  Pump and dump  Elsewhere, a panel entitled ""Post ICO ‚Äì the future of venture capital"" took a brazen look at the more unique dynamics of the crypto-investing universe: namely, how investors manage active portfolios that influence the public market.  Peter Vessenes, former founder of the Bitcoin Foundation and managing director at New Alchemy, which only invests in tokens, talked about the immediate liquidity in crypto markets, as opposed to VC investments.  ""There are a maximum number of trades a VC can do,"" said Vessenes, adding that his firm takes positions, but that trading in and out of tokens was something portfolio firms have shown a greater preference for.  Paul Veradittakit, partner at Pantera Capital, said his firm‚Äôs policy was generally to buy and hold, stating: ""We do trade, say if something has gone up like 1000x, we will take some off the table.""  Details were also provided on each firms' strategy.  David Chang, managing partner at MindWorks Ventures, for example,¬†said his maxiumum exposure to tokens would be between 10 to 15 percent, with an average investment horizon of about seven years.  However, Jason Fang, managing partner, Sora Ventures, said it depends on the jurisdiction: Chinese deals are very different from US deals, he said, which tend to be longer term.  ‚ÄúChina, you try and get the best deal and when it‚Äôs listed you just dump it. If you don‚Äôt dump it someone else will dump it,"" he said, speaking again to the region's gray market dynamic.  Turning Japanese  But if China was the focus for much of the day, talks also focused on a very different narrative in Japan.  Mike Kayamori, CEO at Quoine, the exchange group and regulated ICO platform, was perhaps most vocal in speaking to the country's vibrant crypto economy.¬†Prior to holding his own ICO (with $105 million raised in November last year), Kayamori claims he sat down with Japan‚Äôs watchdog, the FSA, in what was a collaborative engagement.  ""What China has banned, Japan has embraced,"" said Kayamori.  Since regulation was passed that enables token issuers and exchanges to receive official licenses, there have been¬†90-plus applicants waiting to register, he said.  However, he noted that gaining a licence involves KYC/AML checks, segregation of customers‚Äô assets and employing an independent auditor.  And Japan is not without its growing pains.

In a report sent to financial ministers and central bank regulators of the G20 member countries on Tuesday, the¬†OECD said it is looking to develop practical tools and build cooperation in ""examining tax consequences of new technologies,"" such as cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology.  The new effort, the organization said, will start immediately as part of a wider Inclusive Framework that the OECD is developing. The framework will receive another update in 2019, before being introduced by 2020, the OECD said.  The OECD, which primarily works towards stimulating economic development across regions, acknowledged that new technologies like blockchain brings significant technological advantages, yet they also bring uncertainty around tax liabilities ‚Äì an area which the agency seeks to address via standardization in its framework.  ""Technologies like blockchain give rise to both new, secure methods of record-keeping while also facilitating cryptocurrencies which pose risks to the gains made on tax transparency in the last decade,"" the report argued.  The area of cryptocurrency taxation is somewhat contentious topic across diffeent regions.  While there's currently no global standard in defining whether gains from cryptocurrency trading are subject to tax, several countries, such as the U.S. and Japan, have already started applying existing tax laws to the nascent technology.

42428699,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdVjh,1521629147,Bitcoin Returns Above $9K But 'Death Cross' Still a Risk,"Bitcoin's (BTC) three-day winning streak is encouraging for the bulls, but only a quick move above $10,500 would negate the risks of the so-called ""death cross.""  Having bottomed out at $7,335 on Sunday, prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) rose to $9,127 today ‚Äì the highest level since March 14. As of writing, the BPI is seen at $9,074. The retreat from the intraday highs could be associated with the signs of bearish relative strength index divergence seen on the hourly chart.  The 22.7 percent recovery from $7,335 suggests the bulls have regained control, at least for the time being. However, the cryptocurrency is not out of the woods yet, the long duration technical studies indicate.  To start with, the cryptocurrency is still in a downtrend as indicated by the trendline sloping downwards from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high is intact. And furthermore, the imminent and scary-sounding ""death cross"" ‚Äì when the 50-day moving average (MA) will cut the 200-day MA from above ‚Äì could throw a spanner in the works.  Daily chart  The above chart shows (prices as per Bitfinex) that bitcoin will encounter a number of points of stiff resistance in the $9,180‚Äì$9,470 range:  The 200-day moving average is seen at $9,181.  Double top neckline resistance (former support) stands at $9,280 (Feb. 25 low).  The 50-day moving average resistance is seen at $9,449.  50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent drop is $9,470.  A clear break above $9,470 would provide more power to the bulls. That said, the weekly chart indicates a bullish trend reversal only above $11,700.  Hence, the bulls require at least a quick and a convincing break above $10,500 (long-term descending trendline resistance).  Failure to do so will likely result in the 50-day MA cutting the 200-day MA from above (the death cross¬†mentioned above). As discussed on Monday, the death cross is not a reliable indicator, as the major portion of the sell-off has already happened (RSI shows oversold condition) by the time the crossover is confirmed.  However, the death cross could bring a sell-off in this instance, given the RSI is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but holding well above 30.00 (oversold territory).  View  A quick break above $10,500 would open doors for a bullish trend reversal (move above $11,700).  Consolidation around $9,000 could end up triggering another sell-off. In such a scenario, prices could revisit the February low of $6,000.  The longer it takes for BTC to take out $9,180‚Äì$9,470, the higher will be the risks of the ""death cross,"" given the weekly chart is biased to the bears.

According to a letter issued¬†Tuesday, the SZSE is requiring a healthcare device maker called Lifesense to provide details over its Monday announcement that it will partner with a blockchain startup to launch a research lab, purportedly aimed to boost blockchain adoption in the healthcare sector.  Soon after the firm's announcement, its stock price surged by 10 percent and reached the SZSE's daily limit. That drew attention from the exchange, which not only lists public stocks, but also self-regulates public firms to comply with securities law in China.

42428698,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdVhh,1521619205,The 'Crypto Bubble' Is About More Than Market Mania,"Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.      I was at Token Fest in San Francisco last week. It was truly a ""Fest.""  The cocktails flowed at a VIP party the evening before opening. The next morning a band of mariachis and an elaborately costumed troupe of dancers led the first waves of a total of 1,800 attendees into the theater. There, they heard accounts of how, despite regulatory risks and a serious correction in most crypto-asset prices, token projects and ICO fundraising events are still booming.  It all had a very late-1990s feel to it.  And, in case you‚Äôre wondering, I mean that in the very best of ways.  You see, although people who lost their shirts during the dot-com bubble might disagree with me, I regard that end-of-millennium ""Pets.com"" phenomenon as a constructive event. And I apply the same positive mindset to the current crypto bubble. (Yes, this IS a bubble. People will lose money. Many coins will die. This isn‚Äôt FUD.)  One way to look at the current bubble is through the lens of Carlota Perez, the Venezuelan theorist who wrote about the interplay between technology and capital markets in an influential book called ""Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital: The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden Ages."" She concluded that bubbles ‚Äì and their inevitable collapse ‚Äì are an integral, in fact necessary, part of the economic dynamics through which transformational technologies take root in society.  Speculation is an unavoidable accompaniment to periods of technological transformation. Whenever a new technology contains a wide-enough accepted promise that it can redefine core aspects of how our economy functions, people start throwing money at it.  It was the same with the advent of railroads, of electricity and of the internet ‚Äì the latter manifest as the dot-com boom. This happens because no one yet understands how the new model of doing things will play out, and they don‚Äôt yet have any idea who the winners will be. What they agree on is that something big is happening. So society collectively engages in this wild, scattershot speculation.  That, I believe, is what‚Äôs happening now.  The good news, then, is that the crypto bubble is in some respects an affirmation that the technology we‚Äôre all so excited about it does indeed have huge potential even if it is still too nascent for major, disruptive deployment in the mainstream economy.  The bad news, for those heavily invested in speculative tokens ‚Äì many of you readers, no doubt ‚Äì is that the bubble may have to burst, even more painfully than it has, before we can properly unlock this technology‚Äôs profound potential.  Here, the dot-com bubble is informative. The more sophisticated analyses of that otherwise painful event recognize how much the boom contributed to the development of the Internet.  New infrastructure  All that cheap capital, initially invested in underdeveloped projects and a lot of vaporware ‚ÄìPets.com, Boo.com, Webvan and so forth ‚Äì helped pay for the infrastructure upon which the future internet was built.  That money paid for the rollout of fiber-optic¬†cables, went into R&D in 3G mobile technology and funded massive data centers. All of that ""stuff"" was then available, at deeply discounted rates, for developers to work with after the bubble burst. It enabled everything that came afterward: smartphones, social media, algorithmic search, cloud computing, e-marketplaces, Big Data, etc. The sharing and platform economies were made possible by this infrastructure.  I think something similar is going on now. It‚Äôs just that we‚Äôre not building physical infrastructure. It‚Äôs social infrastructure.  The tokens that are part of this current investment mania for ICOs are incentivizing the formation of collaborative networks of developers and entrepreneurs. Together they are coming up with new ideas, each one iterated on top an earlier one. These ideas will shape the decentralized economy of the future.  Importantly, these ideas are being codified in open-source software that everyone can access. Just as Satoshi Nakamoto built bitcoin upon a series of pre-existing technologies ‚Äì public key cryptography, Merkle trees, Hashcash and peer-to-peer system design ‚Äì so, too, will future developers be able to take the pieces of this open-source code that they like and devise new composite technologies.  The code is public scaffolding. And a lot of it is being constructed right now.  Few people would have predicted the business models that gave rise to the post-dot-com titans: Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Uber and so forth. That‚Äôs the beauty of open-source, extensible platforms. They are the base upon which new second- and third-layer technologies can be implemented and flourish.  Well, now that we‚Äôre laying so much more of that open-access platform, we can apply boundless imagination to what may lie ahead. We can imagine a decentralized super-structure in which those centralized internet behemoths become the next in line for disruption, that their data-hogging models become redundant.  I have no idea who or what will be the winners in the decentralized economy of the future. But the framework for those ideas is being laid right now.  And that‚Äôs worth celebrating.

42380486,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8fmOv,1521605723,How Much Should a Blockchain Cost? The Compelling Case for Higher Fees,"According to a group of researchers, cryptocurrency users are a bunch of freeloaders.  Well, maybe they wouldn't go that far, but they argue users aren't paying for certain data they should be paying for, and in turn, are putting the growth of blockchain networks at risk.  At least that's the finding put forth by a¬†new paper¬†that outlines a system for how higher fees could be charged based on the amount of data users need to store on a blockchain and the amount of time their data needs to be stored.  It's a controversial finding since rising transaction fees have set many cryptocurrency communities into infighting as various stakeholders debate the solutions for scaling blockchains and pushing fees down.  For instance, bitcoin's notorious scaling debate many times circled around growing transaction fees, which hit an average of $52¬†at their highest but have since fallen significantly to $1.30, according to BitInfoCharts.  Still, IOHK research fellow¬†Alexander Chepurnoy believes part of the problem is that miners just don't have good ways of pricing their services accordingly.  Chepurnoy told CoinDesk:  ""Miners are judging fees on bitcoin for bandwidth consumption, so for transaction size, and that's it. The idea of our research is we have few a different things we need to charge for.""  Indeed, because of the way transaction fees are decided in most cryptocurrencies today, Chepurnoy said, users are incentivized to overuse some data, making blockchain full node software grow and become more cumbersome to spin up and run ‚Äì which he argues is a bad thing, since full nodes are the most secure way to interact with the bitcoin network.  The pool of data tracking who owns which cryptocurrency is called ""state,"" and this is the data the researchers propose users pay for. (State is typically stored in a special corner of computers called RAM, a type of storage that allows for the easy retrieval of the data, but it also makes that data more expensive to store.)  Blockchain states tend to grow larger and larger over the years as more people adopt these systems and use them more for transacting. Bitcoin's state, for example, has increased by¬†about five times since 2014, while ethereum's is growing even faster.  But by slapping a fee on this data storage, Chepurnoy's hope is that users will be more cognizant of only storing what data is a must, in turn, shrinking the rate at which the state grows.  Why pay more?  For some, paying extra fees would seem to make cryptocurrencies less attractive (as they've generally been touted as less costly ways of transacting), but actually,¬†Chepurnoy's goal is the exact opposite: to make cryptocurrencies easier to use.  At least, easier to use in their most secure form ‚Äì by running a full node.  As mentioned previously, this becomes an issue as adoption and the number of transactions increases. Already, it can take anywhere from a few days to weeks to get a bitcoin full node up and running, and the size of the state takes up roughly the amount of data a normal laptop holds.  And this isn't just a problem for bitcoin, ethereum's state is about three times as big.  Chepurnoy sees these fees as an ""economic solution"" to ""unreasonable"" data growth, slashing transaction data would make it easier to run a full node.  He continued, telling CoinDesk:  ""If cryptocurrencies are for people, not just for banks, then it should be possible to run full nodes on normal laptops today.""  While many blockchain¬†developers are working on solutions to this problem, Chepurnoy believes increasing fees could be a secondary measure for limiting the amount of data stored on the blockchain.  Keeping crypto alive  But coming up with a sensible fee scheme is easier said than done. Chepurnoy admits it's ""trickier"" to put into practice.  Because one way of solving this issue is to make users pay for how long they'd like their state to survive on the blockchain. But this would require users be able to predict¬†exactly how long their state will exist in advance ‚Äì which they many times can't do.  ""Usually you don't want to think about how long your money will be alive,"" Chepurnoy admitted.  As such, the researchers propose an algorithm, what they call ""scheduled payments,"" which allows users to add more fees to a transaction over time, in this way, extending the life of the transaction's state.  Yet, another hurdle that the scheme might face is the grueling process of adding new mechanisms to cryptocurrency systems. For instance, Bitcoin Core developers are more choosy when it comes to updating bitcoin with new features in an effort to protect the integrity and security of the cryptocurrency.  There was a little pushback at the Financial Crypto 2018 conference, where one member argued that adding fees on RAM would introduce ""perverse incentives,"" prompting miners - who are rewarded these fees - to censor the state for their own financial gain.  Still, Chepurnoy believes the proposal might get more attention from ethereum developers, who have considered a similar mechanism called¬†""state storage rent,"" and are dealing with a node state that's growing at an exponential rate.  He stated:  ""We need to avoid this infinite growth.""

The letter advises the IRS to provide guidance ""that offers a temporary rule, in the form a safe harbor"" for affected taxpayers.  Hawkins wrote that such guidance would mean that taxpayers who owned coins created by hard forks in 2017 would be treated as having received the coin from a taxable event. However, the coin would have a value of $0 at the time of the fork.  Under these provisions, the holding period of the forked coin would start at the time of the hard fork. Such guidance would allow taxpayers opting to follow the safe-harbor guidance to be safe from understating their federal tax liability due to their forked coins.  The letter reads:  ""This temporary rule has the benefit of encouraging consistency among taxpayers with respect to 2017 hard forks, avoiding difficult timing and valuation issues (including the ability of tax payers to benefit from hindsight depending on how the values fluctuated during 2017), and providing information to the service regarding holders of the original forked cryptocurrencies.""  The letter also notes that adopting the recommended guidance may mean that capital gains taxes, rather than income taxes, would apply to the forked coin holdings, but ""it preserves the full value of the forked coin for taxation when the taxpayer sells it.""  The taxation of cryptocurrencies has been something of a point of contention since the IRS first announced that it would treat cryptocurrencies as property in 2014.  In January, major exchange and wallet provider Coinbase began reminding its customers to fulfill their crypto tax obligations and subsequently unveiled a tax calculator tool.
