42379444,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882cp,1494764126,Crypto Utopia? Defining the Greater Good in a Blockchain World,"Cecile Baird and Simon Chan are founding partners of Blockchain For Good (BC4G), a think tank that aims to bring together minds from around the world to explore and debate the development of blockchain, for the greater good of humanity, society, economy and the environment.  In this opinion piece, Baird and Chan argue that we need a duty of care today, for a humanised blockchain future tomorrow.  Blockchain’s public interface, at its most basic, is a string of shared data made up of a series of uniquely ordered alphabetical letters and numbers, timestamped and immutable.  Yet, through this, blockchain can fundamentally change existing organisational structures, not merely as an evolutionary development, but potentially as a transformational technology. While it continues to develop, we need explore the opportunities that blockchain technology can offer and the consequences of not getting it right.  To do this, we believe we should zero in on one area that has not yet received the same level of attention or investment: the human aspect of the blockchain, and how it could underpin the technologies that impact our everyday lives.  Together, we need to identify some guiding principles on how we can shape an underlying duty of care, bringing together great minds in the fields of entrepreneurship, investing, academia, sustainability, charities and policymaking to tackle this challenge.  Defining 'good' in an age of new value  We are living in a world where ‘for good’ has become zeitgeist and is often interpreted as 'social good'. However to set the scene of the discussion it is really important to note that 'for good' is not limited to non-profit activities or the third sector.  There are incredibly varied views of what 'for good' means – for creative industries, it is transparency and fair distribution of royalties; for refugees, it is establishing or protecting identity; for charities, it is about accountability; and for government, it is about delivering better services to the public.  But what was interesting is the commonality between the interpretations of 'for good' – the notion of creating new value, under a framework of ethics and clear moral intentions. When considering how blockchain can be used for good, it is important that we look at its relationship with creating new value.  Businesses that will continue to thrive tomorrow, will be those with a clear purpose underpinned by a commitment that balances the triple bottom line of people, profit and planet.  Blockchain dystopia  Where there is a vision of utopia, there is an equal possibility of dystopia. We have already seen cases where bad actors have manipulated projects based on blockchain technology quicker than the community can prevent attacks.  There is a second way where we do not get blockchain right, which can be equally systemic. Unless there is an unambiguous and clearly defined ethical system, there can be no ethics.  A lack of an ecosystem and, perhaps worse still, a manipulated ecosystem, would fundamentally undermine the principles on which blockchain has been built: a transparent, immutable and distributed ledger.  The best-case scenario is that we end up with a large number of unconnected, private blockchain networks. But the worst-case scenario is that see the emergence of monopolies that shape the development of blockchain technology that benefit the privileged few at the cost of others.  Recasting trust  Blockchain can recast trust relationships between government, people and business. As the Edelman’s Trust Barometer, a survey of over 30,000 individuals globally, suggests, there is a widening trust gap between these three groups. Blockchain technology offers a new model that can help solve this point of crisis.  We believe we have distilled five areas that should be considered when developing a duty-of-care manifesto:  Distributed power  Blockchain technology does not allow vested interest in any one individual and power is given by consensus. As such, this creates network integrity and enables transparency by design. The principle of users being able to use, but not to manipulate, the system should be an underlying principle for enabling the technology to be used for good.  Authentication and new trust  One aspect that needs to be considered is how a distributed ledger would impact data privacy, data ownership and misuse of data.  Transparency and balance  How can these functionalities be used to enable good? There must be balance and compromise. There is no point using blockchain with the same frame of mind as with our existing economy and system.  Incentivised and accelerated value  The decentralised structure of blockchain technology passes value through to individuals. As such, there is no central authority setting economic policies or regulating the distribution, the incentive for action is open and put in the hands of everyone as there is a fair value exchange.  The role of communications  If we’re integrating blockchain technology into government infrastructure, it is essential that we focus on deployment in places where it is needed most. It is important that decision makers and policymakers are properly engaged. To safeguard the future of blockchain technology, ensuring it is being used for good and trusted, there is an onus for everyone – industry and government, and those communicating on its behalf – to do so responsibly.  What is clear is that we do require a federated model – a guiding hand, to set the vision and principles to enable its success, for the greater good – whilst allowing verticals or countries to govern their specific areas. To be clear, this is not a government, a centralised organisation or even regulation, but policy and principles that document a duty of care for blockchain technology.

42379451,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX882kN,1494761441,Traditional IRAs Are Coming to the World of Bitcoin,"New consumer interest in bitcoin is trickling up into traditional retirement savings products and tax-advantaged vehicles like Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).  But while a new phenomenon, cryptocurrency IRAs are no different than IRAs invested in more traditional options like stocks and bonds. Holders of IRAs can deduct contributions from their income tax every year until the commencement of disbursements, currently at 59.5 years old in the US.  However, while there is no legal difference in an IRA account's status based on the investment, most popular IRA providers only allow pre-approved investments, not more unusual options like cryptocurrencies or private equity and property.  According to data from Greene IRA, 38% of Americans use IRAs as a type of retirement savings.  New options  Currently, the firm BitcoinIRA is the only option for investors who wish to hold cryptocurrencies in their IRAs directly, using Kingdom Trust and Palo Alto-based BitGo for storage. BitcoinIRA took its first accounts in June 2016, and just recently began offering ethereum IRAs as well. (The firm even boasts former US Mint director Ed Moy as an advisorhttps://bitcoinira.com/about-edmoy).  Investors with 401ks through their employers can transfer those funds into such IRAs under certain circumstances.  Damon Smedley, a BitcoinIRA investor, who lives in Portland, Oregon, opened an account with BitcoinIRA last year. A former manufacturing engineer for a major technology company, Smedley bought his first bitcoins in 2013 and has monitored the price since.  That's a typical profile for early BitcoinIRA investors, said Chris Kline, chief operating officer of BitcoinIRA. But increasingly, Kline said, he has seen inquires from people who were less interested in the technology and were instead motivated by the uptrends in digital currency prices.  Kline told CoinDesk:  ""We've had experts and novices, 25–75 age range, an even mix of gender and a blend of reasons for looking at bitcoin.""  BitcoinIRA charges a one-time upfront fee of 15% on deposits of $15,000–$100,000; 13% on $100,000–$200,000 placements and 11% on those $200,000 and above.  Kingdom Trust, a self-directed IRA provider and BitcoinIRA partner, also charges a custodian fee for holding bitcoins in a multi-signature wallet, enabling investors to verify funds in real-time.  Uptick in interest  Kline said BitcoinIRA has seen a surge in interest as bitcoin prices have skyrocketed. To date, the price of bitcoin has almost doubled this year: from just under $1,000 at the end of 2016 to nearly $2,000 today.  Considering this growth, Kline expects cryptocurrencies to one day be as commonly held in IRAs as stocks or bonds. Indeed, if there is one asset class well suited for retirement savings products like IRAs, it might be deflationary cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which increase in value over time. (It's important to note, however, not all cryptocurrencies are deflationary by design).  Notably, too, ethereum has climbed 900% since the beginning of the year, and the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies has spiked 80% over the last month alone.  Another option for some IRA investors, who would like to benefit from the price increases without holding cryptocurrencies, is private placement with products offered by Grayscale Investments, a digital currency startup providing products for high net-worth investors and that works with IRA administrator The Entrust Group.  For its products, investors must be accredited, which means a net worth of over $1m or income over $200,000 in each of the last two years.  Both BitcoinIRA and The Entrust Group administer 'self-directed' IRAs, which means the account owner is responsible for their investments, including understanding the tax consequences.  That's why the Government Accountability Office issued a report in January calling for more clarity on the tax consequences of less-common IRA investments so that investors are aware of the risk.  For example, the IRS classifies virtual currencies as property today.  Officials with the IRS have started compiling data on alternative investments in IRAs, including cryptocurrencies, and said in statements they plan to release findings sometime this year.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Grayscale Investments.
