42390782,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdJr4b,1718668795,PoliFi Tokens Down Double Digits on Claims DJT Token Has Trump's Backing,"DJT skyrockets on Trump rumors.  PoliFi tokens that share the former president's name dropped over 10%.  DJT, a crypto token minted two months ago on the Solana blockchain, rallied as much as 180% Monday on an unconfirmed report that former U.S. president Donald J. Trump is behind it.  If the report is true, this would be the first time a presidential candidate from a major political party has created a cryptocurrency – but as of press time, that appears to be a big ""if.""  ""Per conversations, Trump is launching an official token — $DJT on Solana,"" Pirate Wires, a maverick media outlet, posted on X (formerly Twitter).  Trump's son Barron is ""spearheading"" the project, said the publication, which is known for its critical reporting on San Francisco Bay Area politicians, irreverent voice and optimistic stance about technology.  Mike Solana, the CMO of venture capital firm Founders Fund and editor-in-chief of Pirate Wires, posted a smart contract address in a reply to his publication's tweet ""for visibility.""  The token in that contract had a $177 million market capitalization at press time.  Meanwhile, PoliFi tokens that share the former president's name were down double digits on the news, according to CoinGecko data.  The Trump token, the first PoliFi token with a market cap of over $370 million, was down 30%, while Tremp, another token that's a cross between the former President and Doland Duck – a bastardized version of Donald Duck with an attitude problem – is down over 40% while the Joe Biden-themed Boden token is down 30%.  ""They’re targeting us, putting us in the red. Literally seems like a greedy psy op,"" Steven Steele, marketing director of the PoliFi Trump token, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  Pirate Wires' Mike Solana later clarified that he ""didn't speak with Trump directly,"" and said it was possible that the Republican presidential candidate ""could rug pull, or pivot, say it's not true.""  ""Just reporting what I know via sources,"" said Mike Solana (his sharing a name with the blockchain is coincidental).  The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. As of press time, Trump had posted nothing on his TruthSocial platform mentioning a token.  Crypto community members' reactions to the report were largely skeptical. Ryan Selkis, founder of data provider Messari and a vocal Trump supporter, said he guessed the odds were ""50-50"" that the token is legit or an act of deceit.     On Polymarket, the crypto-based prediction market platform, bettors gave only a 7% chance that Trump would launch a token by Friday.  Shkreli Denies Involvement  Crypto Twitter sleuths had quickly put together a connection between the coin and convicted pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli, noticing that the admins of the $DJT Telegram group were also admins of a token supported by Shkreli.  On a late night X space Shkreli denied involvement in the token, but claimed to know that it was an authentic project from the campaign and may be listed on exchanges in the near future.  ""I can confirm that this is an authentic Trump token. I'm familiar with the situation, but it's not my token—it's Trump's. It's up to you to decide what you believe, but I'm 100% certain it's an official Trump token,"" he said on the X space. ""It's not my project. I can't guarantee anything. I don't speak for it.

If this price surge occurs, XRP’s current modest value could skyrocket to an impressive $500 during this bullish cycle, albeit under certain conditions. Analyst Foresees XRP Surging By 102,590% In an X (formerly Twitter) post, on June 10, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Egrag Crypto,’ shared a detailed price chart depicting when XRP will surge to new all-time highs this bullish cycle. The analyst projected an astonishing price increase for XRP, revealing that the cryptocurrency could witness a 102,590% surge to a price peak of $500. Related Reading: Bernstein Analysts Revise Bitcoin Target, $200,000 And $1 Million Become Main Focus In his price chart, Egrag Crypto revealed that XRP could see a gradual price increase to $500. He pinpointed several price targets using different trend lines, highlighting a potential price surge to $6, $20, 60, $180 and then a $500 top. The analyst also disclosed a slight catch in his ambitious price forecast. From his analysis, he unveiled two major timelines for XRP to reach his predicted price target, emphasizing the possibility of the cryptocurrency following two distinct cycles – the Blue Cycle and the Green Cycle. Egrag Crypto indicated that if XRP follows the Blue Cycle, then it could potentially witness a price increase to its cycle top by July 2024. The Blue Cycle represents the 39-month period (1,186 days) during which XRP climbed to a cycle top of $1.96 in April 2021, following its all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. In contrast, if XRP follows the Green Cycle, its price could potentially witness a breakout to the $500 cycle peak by May 2025. In this instance, the Green Cycle refers to the 49 months (1,492 days) between the December 2013 peak of $0.0614 and the XRP’s January 2018 all-time high. Egrag Crypto has based his predictions on the patterns generated from XRP’s price movements across different price cycles over the previous years. He disclosed that the duration of XRP’s rise to $500 was measured from cycle top to cycle top, utilizing this approach to determine his ambitious price target for the cryptocurrency. Momentum Suppressed By The SEC? Crypto analyst, Levi Rietveld indicated in an X post that XRP’s momentum has been suppressed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for too long. The analyst refers to XRP’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, which started in late 2020 when the regulator filed a lawsuit against Ripple, claiming that the crypto payments company was selling XRP in an unregistered security offering. Related Reading: Ethereum: 200,000 ETH Options Expiry Spurs Demand – How Far Can Price Go? Despite Ripple’s partial victory after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that programmatic sales of XRP were not considered securities, the cryptocurrency’s price remains on a downward trend. Since the beginning of the year, XRP’s value has stagnated while other altcoins in the market have surged considerably. With the lawsuit still ongoing, XRP’s price still maintains a sluggish momentum, trading under $1 for years now. As of writing, the price of XRP is $0.49, reflecting a 1.29% decline over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. Crypto analyst, Egrag Crypto has also confirmed that the results of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple will be a determining factor in his bullish $500 price target for XRP. He has urged the XRP army to remain patient and prepare for July 2024 or May 2025, highlighting that these key dates could change the lives of XRP investors.

42390784,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdJr9j,1718662027,"Trump and Biden Likely Won't Shake Hands at Debate, Prediction Market Says","This week in prediction markets:  Polymarket bettors doubt Biden and Trump will shake hands at debate.  Manifold forecasters expect a correction from the Guardian.  Prediction markets don't see an Edmonton Stanley Cup victory, nor do sportsbooks  The handshake has long been a key component of U.S. presidential debates. It's a gesture of civility and mutual respect, despite opposing ideas, and has been the ""first scene"" (and last) of presidential debates for the last four decades (though it was absent from the first televised one in 1960).  But Polymarket bettors doubt there will be one during the first 2024 presidential debate, scheduled for June 27.  ""This market will resolve to 'Yes' if Donald Trump and Joe Biden shake hands at any point immediately before, during, or immediately after the first in-person presidential debate in the 2024 election cycle,"" the market contract reads, with ""yes"" shares currently trading at 32 cents.  For the uninitiated, in prediction markets, individuals who predict the correct outcome are rewarded with $1 per share, whereas those who guess incorrectly earn nothing. The price of a share indicates the perceived probability of an event; for example, a share priced at 32 cents implies a 32% likelihood of that event occurring.  The break in handshakes started during the 2016 election cycle, when debates began to get particularly acrimonious compared to the past.  Biden and Trump didn't shake hands during the 2020 debate cycle, not because of hostility and acrimony between the candidates – there was plenty of that – but rather Covid protocols.  Former President Trump's claims that the 2020 election was stolen will likely come up during the debate, as well as his mounting legal troubles. Trump will likely respond with Hunter Biden's legal woes as well as make comments about President Biden's mental agility.  Does this sound like the sort of environment where two people will shake hands before or after?  Meanwhile, the rumor mill is playing a guessing game as to whether the Biden campaign will accept cryptocurrency donations, following a move by Trump to do so.  Don't bet on it, Polymarket bettors say, giving it just a 14% chance of happening by June 21.  Betting on a Correction  The Guardian published an article Sunday depicting prediction markets and their supporters in an unflattering light, associating them with convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried and with ""scientific racism."" Now there's a prediction market on whether the U.K. newspaper will correct the story.  Forecasters on Manifold.markets see an 84% chance that the Guardian will correct at least one of the factual statements in the article. The contract will resolve to ""yes"" if the publication acknowledges an error in an editor's note, makes a ""stealth edit,"" or removes the piece entirely.  Unlike Polymarket, where bets are settled in cryptocurrency, Manifold is a self-described ""play money"" market. Bets are made in a digital (not crypto) currency called mana. Users start with 200 mana for free and can buy more. They can't cash out. The pitch for betting on Manifold is that it allows participants to build a reputation as accurate forecasters.  The Guardian article claimed that former FTX CEO Bankman-Fried ""funneled"" nearly $5 million of the crypto exchange's customers' funds to a nonprofit called Lightcone Infrastructure. Lightcone, the piece said, used the money to buy a former hotel in Berkeley, Calif. FTX trustees are seeking the return of the allegedly misappropriated funds, according to the Guardian.  Last week, the former hotel was the venue for the Manifest 2024 conference on prediction markets and forecasting hosted by Manifold and Manifund. The latter organization is a nonprofit that helps fund charitable projects (the Guardian misdescribed it as a prediction market). The piece highlighted controversial statements some of the conference speakers have made about topics unrelated to prediction markets.  On X (formerly Twitter), Oliver Habryka, Lightcone Infrastructure's CEO, identified five factual errors with the piece (including the mischaracterization of Manifund).     Habryka said he isn't considering legal action against the Guardian, posting on X that ""U.K. libel law is pretty insane, and I would feel terrible wielding it against anyone.""  No such puck  The Stanley Cup finals looked like a sure thing for the Florida Panthers until this weekend's game—the fourth in the series—when the Edmonton Oilers demolished the competition, winning 8-1.  But this momentum didn't do much for Edmonton's chances at winning the Stanley Cup, according to prediction markets, only resulting in a three percentage point gain, from 7% to 10%, putting Florida's chances of victory at 90%.  Sportsbooks are giving Edmonton a slight edge when compared to Polymarket, but not by much: BetMGM's book is giving the Oilers 8.25 over the Panthers' 1.08, which converts to the Oilers having a 12% chance. Other sportsbooks are giving similar odds, with Oilers coming in at 12% to 13%.  Florida just needs to win one more game to finish the series and take home the Stanley Cup. That next game is back on home ice, where the Oilers have consistently lost.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/17/trump-and-biden-likely-wont-shake-hands-at-debate-prediction-market-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9682b083c37725a5c2b54a547535acbc2b58320c-1920x1281.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After a period of consolidation between $1 and $2 since 2022, TON’s price has surged to reach a record high of $8.25 on June 15. This achievement is accompanied by a significant increase in the TON blockchain’s Total Value Locked (TVL), doubling from $300 million. TON Blockchain’s TVL Hits $600 Million According to technical analyst Kyle Doops, the TON blockchain’s TVL has experienced an unprecedented surge, reaching $608.65 million and doubling its value within three weeks. For Doops, this increase can be attributed to TON’s integration with Telegram, leveraging its broad consumer base of over 900 million users. Furthermore, protocols such as DeDust, bemo, and Stakee have seen significant increases in their TVL, contributing to the growth of the TON ecosystem. Related Reading: This Altcoin Gem Will Overtake Solana, Predicts Arthur Hayes As reported by NewsBTC, Telegram introduced a new advertising feature allowing users to promote their channels through ad placements. To facilitate fast and secure ad payments and withdrawals, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov has exclusively chosen the TON blockchain. Pavel explained that users can now purchase ad space with Toncoins, and revenue generated from ads will be shared with channel owners in Toncoin. According to the social media platform’s CEO, this approach creates a “virtuous cycle,” allowing content creators to reinvest revenue into channel promotion and upgrades. In addition, daily active wallets on the TON network have reached over 388,000, with monthly active wallets surpassing 5.5 million. Crypto researcher Leon Waidmann notes that TON’s increase in active wallets surpasses even Coinbase’s Layer 2 (L2) BASE, setting a new standard for growth and adoption in the crypto industry. Analyst Forecasts 40% Potential Breakout For Toncoin Although TON has experienced a slight decline of 1.2% over the past 24 hours, trading volume has increased by 22%, indicating strong investor interest in the token, according to CoinGecko data. Despite short-term corrections, TON has shown significant gains over various time frames, with increases of 11%, 18%, and 22% over the past seven, fourteen, and thirty days, respectively. Related Reading: Metrics Signal Bitcoin Price Increase – But When Is Anyone’s Guess In a bullish projection for the Toncoin price, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests that TON may be gearing up for a potential 40% breakout, targeting a price of $11. Nevertheless, the analyst added that the TD Sequential indicator suggests a potential dip to $7.2 to gather liquidity before an upside move. In the near term, key support levels include $7.78, which has prevented a deeper retracement for the token and the $8.17 resistance.

Last week, digital asset investment products saw substantial outflows, which CoinShares attributed to several key economic updates. These included the release of US CPI data, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, and Producer Price Index (PPI) figures. These events seemed to spark a rapid surge in Bitcoin price, pushing it briefly towards the $70,000 mark before a swift downturn adjusted the valuation back to around $65,000. Related Reading: Metrics Signal Bitcoin Price Increase – But When Is Anyone’s Guess Market Shifts: BTC Faces Major Outflows While Some Altcoins Attract Investment So far, this fluctuation in Bitcoin’s price is part of a broader pattern of volatility that has characterized the digital currency market. Just last week alone, institutional and retail investors pulled back approximately $600 million from crypto funds, marking a significant retreat. CoinShares suggests that this could signal a growing trend of caution, amplified by a “hawkish stance” at the recent FOMC meeting, which may have encouraged investors to reduce their exposure to volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, notably the most impacted, faced outflows totaling $621 million. Despite this, there was a silver lining as altcoins like Ethereum, Litecoin, and others saw minor inflows. Ethereum led with a $13 million increase, suggesting divergent investor confidence in altcoins compared to Bitcoin. This scenario presents a mixed view where Bitcoin struggles under selling pressure while select altcoins gain marginal traction. Meanwhile, the overall impact on the market has been palpable, with total assets under management dropping from over $100 billion to $94 billion within a week. Trading volumes also dipped significantly from their annual average, indicating a cautious approach by traders across the board. Regionally, while the US experienced the brunt of the outflows, countries like Germany saw inflows, suggesting a varied global response to the current economic climate. Bitcoin ETFs See Mixed Fortunes Despite a steady increase in the overall net inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which reached $15.11 billion in recent weeks, the sector experienced a downturn last week with a net outflow of $190 million per day, based on data from SoSoValue. In terms of market performance, Bitcoin’s value sharply declined, hitting a low of $65,398 last Friday. However, as of today, Bitcoin’s price has slightly recovered to $65,552, though it still shows a decline of 1.1% in the past day and 5.5% over the week. Speaking on Bitcoin spot ETFs, BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer, Samara Cohen, has observed a gradual but steady interest in them despite their slower-than-expected uptake. According to Cohen, currently, the majority of Bitcoin ETF transactions, approximately 80%, are conducted by “self-directed investors” using online brokerage platforms. Cohen added that the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is one of the ETFs launched this year, attracting attention from individual investors and hedge funds and brokerages, as indicated in the recent 13-F filings.

The ZKsync Association, a non-profit created and launched last week by the development firm behind ZKsync, Matter Labs, is in charge of the airdrop claims. The team tweeted that 45% of tokens were claimed by users in under two hours.  “It's a Monday, don't you have work?” the ZK Nation X account wrote.  The ZK token opened at $0.31 and is down about 31% since then, trading at $0.22 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko. The market capitalization stands at about $800 million, based on the circulating supply, with about 3.7 billion tokens eligible to be distributed. On a fully diluted basis, the market cap would be $4.5 billion.  Cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, Bybit and KuCoin have currently listed the ZK token, even though Binance had announced earlier that it would postpone the listing on its platform after experiencing tech issues with their node.  “Our tech team is fixing it urgently, and will be recovered before trading starts. Deposits will be credited once the block height catches up,” Binance wrote on X.  Last week, the Matter Labs team shared with CoinDesk how the ZKsync Association plans to distribute the tokens.  Some users were upset with the design of the airdrop, which led the team to acknowledge their ""unconventional design.""  According to their plans, 89% of the airdrop can be claimed by ZKsync users, which includes anyone that transacted on the ZKsync blockchain and met an unspecified threshold of activity. The remaining tokens go to ecosystem contributors including: ZKsync native projects (5.8%), on-chain communities (2.8%) and builders (2.4%).  Matter Labs also shared that employees will get 16.1% of ZK tokens, and investors 17.2%, which will be locked for a year and then released over three years.  The rest of the token supply will be split and go to ZKsync’s Token Assembly (29.3%), which will use it for new governance purposes, and the rest to Ecosystem Initiatives (19.9%).

29608565,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625037,1718652610,"Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Sees Triple-Digit Surge Across Major Metrics, What’s Going On?","Key Shibarium metrics suggest the Shiba Inu ecosystem might be gearing up for a push to the upside. Notably, Shibarium’s transaction data has seen triple-digit percentage jumps in transactions and fees paid in BONE over the past week. This suggests Shiba Inu might be receiving increased attention from traders, a scenario that may result in SHIB rebounding at a crucial support level during the course of the week. Shibarium Sees Massive Surge In Activity Over the Weekend According to the latest data, transactions on the Shibarium network exploded over the weekend, soaring a whopping 441% on Saturday. Over 13,190 transactions were recorded on Shibarium on Saturday, up from just under 3,500 earlier in the week. The massive surge in activity led to higher fees on the network as it strained under the increased load. Related Reading: Spot Ethereum ETFs Expected To Begin Trading On July 2, Can This Propel ETH To $10,000? Consequently, the average fees paid in BONE on Shibarium transactions jumped 176%. Furthermore, data from Shibariumscan indicates that 154 new accounts were created on Sunday, a 1,600% increase from 9 new accounts created on Monday, June 10. Interestingly, these numbers are small compared to metrics recorded on Shibarium earlier in the year. However, their increases have come during a particularly bearish period for the Shiba Inu community. This is a positive sign for SHIB price, as the increase in transactions increases the amount of gas fees, which in turn increases the number of SHIB tokens to be burned. Current State Of Shiba Inu At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002013 and is currently down by 2.21% in the past 24 hours. Notably, SHIB has declined for the past seven days amidst a wider market price drop led by Bitcoin. Consequently, SHIB has lost 13.11% of its market cap in the past seven days as traders continue to exit their long positions. SHIB now finds itself trading around the psychological $0.000020 price zone and could even break down further despite Shibarium’s transaction surge over the weekend. According to data from IntoTheBlock, only about 3.97 trillion SHIB tokens purchased by 5,270 addresses serve as resistance at this price level. If SHIB fails to defend this support and breaks below, the next key level is at $0.000190, where 4,310 addresses are currently holding 6.21 trillion SHIB tokens.

Lucie, Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, recently hinted at an airdrop for everyone who bridged to Shibarium in the first year, sparking interest from Shib enthusiasts. Nevertheless, Lucie provided clarification and noted that this is merely an imaginary scenario and does not guarantee anything. “THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION PROMISING NOTHING.

42390767,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bdJpkX,1718650411,Cryptocurrencies: The Key to Financial Sovereignty,"The interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial. Authors' views and opinions are their own and not associated with CoinDesk Indices.  What inspired you to found Hyperion Decimus, and what sets it apart from other investment firms?  We founded the firm for three main reasons. First, to offer investors a way to derive alpha from the rapidly growing and complex digital asset market from institutional-level investing, portfolio management, and advisory services. Second, to provide investors with an alternative to the inefficient, outdated, and crisis-prone centralized financial system. And, third, we built Hyperion Decimus to capitalize on the rise of digital assets and decentralized finance, which heralds a significant shift in how people view and interact with financial systems.  What draws you to the world of cryptocurrency, and how do you envision its role in the future of finance?  Cryptocurrencies offer an alternative financial system providing greater freedom, control, transparency, and security. They empower individuals by reducing dependence on central banks and traditional financial institutions. Key to this is financial sovereignty: crypto-currencies allow individuals to fully control their financial assets. This marks a significant departure from the traditional banking system, where access and usage of funds can be restricted. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies are revolutionizing the future of finance by promoting decentralization, enhancing efficiency and transparency, expanding financial inclusion, and driving innovation. As technology matures and regulatory frameworks evolve, cryptocurrencies will become an integral part of the global financial system.  Can you provide insight into the philosophy behind your strategies and your approach to navigating the volatile crypto market?  Our philosophy emphasizes diversification, sophisticated quantitative analysis, and a deep understanding of the digital asset space to generate non-correlated alpha and returns independent of traditional market movements. We use advanced quantitative models and extensive data analysis to identify investment opportunities, enabling informed decisions based on trends traditional analysis might miss. We mitigate risk by diversifying investments across various digital assets and strategies, minimizing the impact of adverse price movements. Astute asset managers can use market-neutral strategies like arbitrage to exploit price discrepancies and view volatility like a “friend,” because when prices go up and down it creates opportunities.  Can you tell me a little about your new fund, the HD CoinDesk Acheilus Fund?  We launched the HD Acheilus Fund in mid-May to leverage CoinDesk Indices’ Bitcoin and Ether Trend Indicators. This actively managed, single-strategy fund targets institutional investors, aiming to profit from crypto market uptrends while avoiding drawdowns. We use a combination of quantitative and macroeconomic signals to shift between crypto tokens and cash, delivering a disciplined, outcome-driven cryptocurrency investment strategy.  How does Hyperion Decimus navigate compliance and regulatory challenges in the crypto investment space, given the evolving regulatory landscape?  Our dedicated compliance team continuously navigates compliance and regulatory challenges in the crypto investment space through a comprehensive and proactive approach, ensuring adherence to all CFTC and SEC regulations while anticipating future changes. Also, we have established robust internal policies and procedures that meet or exceed regulatory requirements, covering areas such as anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), data protection, and risk management. All of this speaks to a forward-thinking compliance culture that governs all our activities.

As the cryptocurrency market experiences volatility, Solana’s price has encountered resistance levels that pose challenges to its bullish trajectory. Investors and analysts are closely watching these developments, trying to gauge what lies ahead for SOL. This article explores the current price hurdles facing Solana, delves into future outlooks, and offers predictions on how these obstacles could impact its market performance. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors seeking to navigate the uncertain terrain of Solana’s price movements. As of the time of writing, SOL has a market capitalization of over $67 billion, a trading volume of over $1.3 billion, and a price drop of 5.40%, trading at around $146 over the past 24 hours. Despite the price decline, its market capitalization and trading volume increased by 0.64% and 40.90%, respectively. Current Market Analysis For Solana Currently, on the 4-hour chart, the price of SOL after attempting to move upward has begun to drop again with two bearish candlesticks dropped. Also, Solana is trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicating that the price might remain bearish. Although the composite trend oscillator indicator on the 4-hour chart indicates that SOL’s price may move upward as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are heading toward the zero line, it should be noted that this is only a short-term measure because the price will eventually drop even further. Meanwhile, on the 1-day chart, it can be observed that Solana is bearish as it is trading below the 100-day SMA and also attempting to drop a bearish candlestick with strong momentum. Also, the signal line and SMA of the 1-day composite trend oscillator have broken below the zero line and are moving toward the oversold zone, which suggests that the price of SOL may move very bearish. Expert Opinions On SOL’s Price Outlook As of right now, Solana’s price is moving downward toward the $140 support level. If SOL breaks below this level, it will continue to move downward to test the $118 support level and may move on to challenge the $99 support level if it breaks below the $118 level. Nonetheless, prices may begin to increase in the direction of the $160 resistance level if it is unable to cross any of the previously mentioned levels. If it breaks above this $160 level, it will continue to rise and challenge the resistance level at $188. Furthermore, should SOL break above this level, it can also see a higher price move to challenge the $205 resistance level on the chart.

42408062,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga90xU,1718644646,Telecom Giant and T-Mobile Parent Deutsche Telekom Plans to Mine Bitcoin,"Bitcoin mining might soon gain a new player: telecommunication giant Deutsche Telekom, the parent company of one of the largest U.S. telcos, T-Mobile.  ""We will engage in digital monetary photosynthesis soon,"" Dirk Röder, Head of web3 infrastructure and solutions of T-Mobile's Telekom MMS, said during the BTC Prague conference last week. When asked by the conference host if T-Mobile is mining bitcoin, he answered, ""We will.""  The announcement comes as the mining sector has experienced a tremendous roller-coaster ride, with 2021's bull market, subsequent crypto winter and the latest halving, which lowered the bitcoin rewards by half.  Röder didn't specify where or at what capacity his company will be mining bitcoin, but the entrance of such a large corporation has both positive and potentially negative implications for the industry.  Deutsche Telekom has been very active in the digital assets sector for years. It has been running validators on networks such as Polygon, Q, Flow, Celo, Chainlink and Ethereum. The telecom giant also started Energy Web Chain last year, which the company said was ""the world’s first public blockchain designed explicitly for the energy sector"" and will help to create a ""more decentralized, digitalized, and decarbonized energy system.""  Röder also said during the conference that his company has been running a Bitcoin node and Lightning nodes since 2023.  The move has given the sentiment of the bitcoin mining community a boost, as T-Mobile (TMUS)—which has more than $200 billion market cap—participating in making Bitcoin safer is positive for the network. However, it also poses the question of whether such a large player entering the arena will ramp up the competition for the incumbent miners who are already facing tougher competition.  T-Mobile's Web3 journey has previously seen some controversy, as the company faced several lawsuits after customers of T-Mobile, along with its competitor AT&T, had been victims of ""SIM swapping"" attacks.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/17/telecom-giant-and-t-mobile-parent-deutsche-telekom-plans-to-mine-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dca4621fc7abba50cfcb243638d6b1762383c952-5990x3369.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

29603181,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624993,1718641812,"Bitcoin Mining Cost At $86,700: Price To Surpass This Soon?","Data suggests the average cost of mining Bitcoin is standing around $86,700 right now. Here’s what history suggests could happen next for BTC. Bitcoin Average Mining Cost Is Currently Notably Higher Than The Price In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how the average mining cost of BTC is looking like right now. The Bitcoin network runs on a consensus mechanism based on the “proof-of-work” in which validators called the miners compete against each other using computing power to get to hash the next block on the chain. This computing power naturally has its running cost, with electricity being the most notable expense that the miners have to pay, given that it’s a perpetual cost. The incentive for spending capital on mining operations lies in the block rewards that these validators receive upon successfully adding the next block. Obviously, mining expenses are different depending on location, as electricity prices aren’t the same everywhere. As such, the chart that Ali has cited from MacroMicro uses data provided by the Cambridge University on BTC electricity consumption to find out an average value. Related Reading: Bitcoin FOMO: Social Media Users Calling To Buy Sub-$66,000 Dip Below is the chart in question, which shows how the average mining cost on the Bitcoin network has changed over the past few years. As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin average mining cost (colored in blue) had been below the price of the cryptocurrency earlier in the year, but recently, the former’s value has spiked and has surpassed the latter’s. The reason behind this sudden increase is that there is another variable at play when calculating the average cost of mining Bitcoin: the Issuance, or the number of tokens that the miners are minting daily. In general, the block rewards stay fixed both in value and frequency, so the Issuance of the network, which is nothing else than the sum of the block rewards mined in a day, more or less remains fixed as well. Specific events, however, don’t abide by this. They are the Halvings. These periodic events that take place approximately every four years permanently slash the block rewards in half. The latest such event, the fourth ever in the cryptocurrency’s history, occurred back in April. Naturally, the Halvings mean that the cost of mining 1 BTC drastically goes up, as miners only get half as many rewards as before after doing the same amount of work. Thus, it’s not surprising that the cost of production for the coin observed a sharp increase coinciding with the latest Halving. At present, this metric stands at $86,700, meaning that according to MacroMicro’s model, the average miner would be underwater. Related Reading: Dogecoin Plunges 11%, But This On-Chain Cushion Could End Decline Based on the past trend of the indicator, Ali has identified a pattern that Bitcoin has always followed. “Historically, BTC always surges above its average mining cost!” notes the analyst. As such, if this pattern continues to hold for the current cycle as well, then it may only be a matter of time before Bitcoin surges past the $86,700 mark. BTC Price Bitcoin has gone through a drawdown of more than 5% recently, which has brought its price under the $66,000 level.

The company is enjoying a temporary surge from elevated Q1 volatility, stemming in large part from the January release of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Over the long run, Coinbase faces stiff competition from Binance as well as brokerages like Robinhood, and its revenue exposure to altcoins may also cause it to trip. With the stock already trading at ~10x projected FY25 revenue, it's best to steer clear here. Stocks aren't the only asset class that have soared this year: cryptocurrencies are also experiencing a huge surge, with anchor currency Bitcoin (BTC) up more than 60% year to date. The rise isn't attributed simply to increased investor appetite for risk-taking, however; it's also due to U.S. regulators' approval of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which saw nearly $5 billion in inflows on the first day of trading . Partaking in the upswing as well is Coinbase ( COIN ), one of the world's best-known cryptocurrency exchanges and crypto wallets. Year to date, shares of Coinbase have also leaped ~55%, nearly mirroring the performance of Bitcoin. Data by YCharts To be transparent: I have embraced cryptocurrencies as a diversification tool, and allot a single-digit percentage of my portfolio to large, stable coins including Bitcoin. I'm not, however, as sanguine about Coinbase's prospects in 2024 and beyond. For investors who are relatively newer to the space: Coinbase was an early mover in the crypto space, opening its doors in 2012 (three years after the launch of Bitcoin). While it is the only pure-play crypto exchange, it's also far from the largest; as rival Binance supports nearly double the variety of coins versus Coinbase and has nearly 10x the trading volume (according to CoinMarketCap ). Broadly speaking, while Coinbase is known to be more beginner-friendly, Binance is better-known among diehard crypto enthusiasts and offers more advanced trading functions. Broadly speaking, I see a number of major risks for Coinbase moving forward: The Q1 trading surge may be temporary. Volumes were elevated in Q1 as volatility peaked with renewed interest in Bitcoin following the launch of spot ETFs in January. Competition. ETFs themselves may prove to be a competitive driver versus Coinbase, as more inflows flow in through ""regular"" stock market exchanges and take trading volume away from coins themselves. Most of Coinbase's trading revenue is derived from smaller altcoins. I'm of the belief that the crypto market will eventually converge to a few top coins, on which Coinbase makes a lower spread. Against all of these risks, Coinbase is also quite expensive, even if we judge the stock's current valuation against the peak results it generated in Q1. All in all, I'm pegging Coinbase at a sell rating: steer clear and invest elsewhere. Q1 trading volume may be a fluke We'll acknowledge one thing: Coinbase saw phenomenal results in Q1. Coinbase Q1 revenue trends (Coinbase Q1 shareholder letter) Total revenue grew more than 2x y/y to $1.59 billion, driven by a near-tripling of transactional revenue (Coinbase generates roughly two-thirds of its revenue from trading spreads, while the remainder comes from subscriptions and non-trading fees). This wasn't all a bitcoin ETF story, however. The company notes as well that performance was driven by ~30% growth in the market cap of USDC, the largest ""stablecoin"" that is tethered to the U.S. dollar. The company also grew subscription and services revenue by 41% y/y to $510.9 million, which it attributed in part to growing membership of Coinbase One, the company's consumer subscription plan that starts at a $29.99/month (offering zero trading fees and higher staking rewards, or interest rates, on USDC held in Coinbase accounts). Coinbase One subscribers surpassed 400k in the first quarter. The company also believes that it's helping crypto move beyond just a speculation asset and into a utility. It notes that its new platform Base helps to improve transaction speed and lower costs. Per CEO Brian Armstrong's remarks on the Q1 earnings call highlighting boosted developer activity on Base: Next, let's move on to utility. First, I'd like to spotlight our Layer 2 solution Base. As a reminder, Layer 2 solutions help blockchains scale, similar to when the internet moved from dial-up to broadband. And we believe this scaling will drive many new use cases in the crypto economy. Base has helped dramatically reduce transaction fees and confirmation times, getting us closer to our goal of having the average crypto transaction take less than one second and cost less than $0.01 anywhere in the world. Developer activity on Base increased eight-fold in Q1. In the last 30 days, Base has processed over two times as many transactions as the entire Ethereum network on Layer 1. Base is now the number-one Layer 2 solution by the number of transactions processed, a huge accomplishment. We've made Base faster and cheaper to use with fee reduction by about 80% through protocol upgrades, and our fees are now often below $0.01."" In spite of the organic strength that Coinbase can claim in Q1, we do have to worry about the risk of trading performance - still responsible for the lion's share of the company's revenue - if crypto assets fall. In my view, Q1 saw heightened trading activity from the ETF launch, and crypto has been falling from recent peaks over the past month as ETFs have also seen outflows . Competition from many angles To me, Coinbase has very little moat for preserving either its trading volume or its user base. First, consider ETFs themselves. The entire reason that bitcoin ETFs saw such aggressive inflows when they launched earlier this year was that ETFs make it easier for everyday investors to participate in bitcoin's upside, bypassing crypto wallets and exchanges altogether (which still have an aura of lacking safety, despite years of smooth operations). In my view, bitcoin ETFs - and the potential ETFs of other coins that follow - have the potential to draw trading volume out of exchanges like Coinbase and into ""regular"" brokerages. We should also consider the fact that standard brokerages are also gaining a leg up on Coinbase. Robinhood ( HOOD ), in particular, reported 232% y/y growth in direct crypto trading revenue in Q1. And we note that with Robinhood's ability to support both direct crypto trading as well as ETFs, it may be the biggest beneficiary of this year's renewed interest in crypto. And among more hardened traders, Coinbase has always faced competition from a much larger exchange, Binance. Coinbase may end up getting stuck in the middle as a platform that isn't as ""vanilla"" as Robinhood, but isn't sophisticated enough to support professional traders like Binance. Concentration risk in altcoins Altcoins, or essentially smaller-cap cryptocurrencies, have so far been a very speculative realm. Because of higher spreads on these assets, Coinbase generates the majority of its trading revenue on altcoins. Coinbase Q1 trading share (Coinbase Q1 shareholder letter) In Q1, 55% of the company's transactional revenue was generated from non-Bitcoin, non-Ethereum trades. 43% of trading volume, meanwhile, excludes these assets plus USDT. Many investors, including myself, are of the viewpoint that cryptocurrencies will eventually converge into a smaller pool of ""winners"" rather than continually support hundreds of speculative altcoins. In a longer-term future in which altcoin speculation recedes, spreads earned by exchanges like Coinbase may also correspondingly falter. Valuation, upside risks, and key takeaways We also shouldn't ignore the fact that Coinbase is incredibly expensive after this year's run-up. At current share prices near $245, Coinbase trades at a market cap of $60.0 billion; and after netting off the $7.1 billion of cash and $4.2 billion of debt on Coinbase's most recent balance sheet, the company's resulting enterprise value is $57.1 billion. Meanwhile, for next fiscal year FY25, Wall Street analysts have a consensus revenue target of $5.96 billion for the company, or a -2% y/y decline (essentially betting that this year's heightened trading activity will recur and be sustained). Against that estimate, Coinbase trades at 9.6x EV/FY25 revenue. We note as well that in Q1, Coinbase generated $1.0 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Even if we assume Q1 trading volumes are sustained, and we annualize the company's EBITDA to $4.0 billion, the stock would trade at 14.3x EV/adjusted EBITDA. Either way: there's already a lot of strength priced into Coinbase's stock. To me, there is one significant upside risk to consider, and that's institutional participation in cryptocurrencies. In Q1, institutional revenue made up only 8% of the company's overall revenue (but 82% of trading volume). Coinbase continues to develop its institutional trading platform, Coinbase Prime, which saw record inflows and active clients in Q1 driven by the boosted proliferation of USDC. Prime now offers a more complete suite of custody, trading, financing, and staking services (versus just custody, or wallet, services during the last crypto bull run). A greater feature set and further de-stigmatization of crypto assets may eventually pull more institutional funds into the fold. Still, I view Coinbase as having far more risk than opportunity especially at current share prices.

The non-profit organization’s Ethereum transactions are always significant, considering the impact they usually have on the second-largest crypto token. Ethereum Foundation Transfers $64.4 Million Worth Of ETH Crypto journalist Colin Wu revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that a wallet (0x8e…D052) linked to the Ethereum Foundation transferred 18,089 ETH ($64.4 million) to a new address (0x87…D812). On-chain data shows that the new address has yet to transfer these funds and that the ETH holdings have yet to be offloaded on the market. Related Reading: Solana Whale Shakes Market With $372 Million Transfer, Where Are The Coins Headed? Transactions involving the Ethereum Foundations are always concerning because the non-profit organization has a reputation for selling at the top. As such, the transaction of these funds is one to keep an eye on, considering that the potential sale of these tokens could mean that the Ethereum Foundation is again looking to catch ETH at the top. It is worth mentioning that the Ethereum Foundation has already sold over 1,700 ETH since the start of 2024 with on-chain analytics platform SpotOnChain, noting that these transactions have always occurred ahead of a price drop. Therefore, a potential price drop if these 18,089 ETH are eventually sold is a huge possibility. Despite this development, Ethereum’s outlook is very bullish, especially with Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas stating that the Spot Ethereum ETFs could begin trading by July 2. These funds are expected to spark a significant rally for the second-largest crypto by market cap, with crypto experts like Ash Crypto predicting that Ethereum could rise to $10,000 thanks to these Spot Ethereum ETFs. ETH To $10,000 Is The Most “Asymmetric Bet” Crypto analyst and trader Tyler Durden mentioned that the most asymmetric bet in crypto today is ETH reaching $10,000. He also highlighted Ethereum’s chart against Bitcoin and suggested that ETH was ready for that big move, considering it has traded sideways for eight months. The analyst also suggested that the Spot Ethereum ETFs will play a massive role in Ethereum’s rise to this price level. He stated that Wall Street went through a lot of effort to get the Spot Ethereum ETFs approved and that they would ensure that they make money from ETH while pumping its price. Related Reading: Bernstein Analysts Revise Bitcoin Target, $200,000 And $1 Million Become Main Focus Meanwhile, Durden boldly asserted that money would exit the Solana ecosystem and rotate to Ethereum. He claimed that Solana has lost its “main character and driver of liquidity”, which is why the money will flow into ETH. Interestingly, he mentioned that celebrities have “cannibalised,” which is why he believes that the capital rotation cannot happen the other way around with money moving from Ethereum to Solana. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at around $3,500, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

I expect Coinbase Prime to be a significant revenue driver, focusing on institutional clients. Stablecoins play a big role in this growth phase too. Coinbase's valuation indicates potential upside, with expected revenue growth and strong EBITDA margins, indicating expansion in valuation multiples. Investment thesis ""When life gives you lemons, you make lemonade."" This metaphor aptly describes the second generational opportunity that Coinbase ( COIN ) sits on today as institutional investors have joined retail investors on the bullish bandwagon for seeing enough appeal in cryptocurrency as an alternative asset that justifies capital allocation towards this emerging asset class. While many bitcoin ETFs began trading on exchanges this year, Ethereum ETFs are close to being approved as they reach the final stages of SEC approval . So far, this has drawn record interest in alternative assets , as Bitcoin led the charge in the rally seen in the crypto markets this year. Interest in capital allocation towards alternative assets and digital currency among institutions remains elevated, with data pointing to continued momentum throughout the year . At Morgan Stanley's recent FPC Conference last week, Coinbase's head of institutional product, Greg Tusar, went deep into detailing how Coinbase's institutional product serves as a solid base for the company's strategy for the next leg of growth. In my personal opinion, I strongly suggest investors read the transcript, where management has some astute views on how Coinbase plans to grow the institutional side of the business. I believe Coinbase is positioned yet again at an inflection point where it has built and is continuing to build the required products and infrastructure that will allow it to reap the benefits down the centralized crypto market road. Despite the massive run-up in shares, I still recommend a Buy on Coinbase. The growing significance of Coinbase Prime Coinbase has historically recognized the bulk of its revenues from its trading products on the consumer side as well as on the business side. Revenues collected from trading products are generally trading fees based on take rates collected from participants trading cryptocurrency on Coinbase's platform. Coinbase also later added subscription services, such as Coinbase One, that gave traders additional benefits. During bull markets, an expansion of trading activity meant Coinbase stood to immensely benefit from their fee collection, as noted below in the bull markets during the pandemic years, as noted in Exhibit A. Exhibit A: Coinbase's revenue growth returns to re-acceleration mode in the last two sequential quarters (Coinbase filings via Statista) However, in bear markets, such as the one that followed in 2022, it became clear to management that depending solely on trading revenue, especially for a crypto market that still did not have a wider adoption curve, posed headwinds for Coinbase. The company started doubling down, deploying internal company resources on developing and shipping products for its customers, and getting into ancillary markets that eventually proved to be accretive for the company. In the Q4 earnings call , management continued to talk about the three organizational priorities that they were leaning on to build a solid foundation for their business. First , capitalizing on the current tailwinds that Coinbase was benefiting from due to bullish momentum will always be a mainstay of their business, as Coinbase collects rent at the gateway of trading transactions on its platform. Growing their international markets as well as other trading products, such as spot trading and derivatives, were pivotal. Management also shared how the company maintains a 70% market share in the crypto futures market. Second , it is management's priority to drive utility around crypto to foster the applications of crypto assets and digital currency. In my view, this is going to be a pivotal area for growth as the adoption of crypto assets expands beyond the realms of trading activity as crypto gets more accepted as a medium of payment, store of value, etc. Coinbase Wallet and Base are some of the products and platforms that Coinbase currently offers to its users. While Wallet can be used as more than just a store of value while also being used as a way to facilitate payments for transactions, Base is an on-chain scaling solution built on the Ethereum network meant to build Layer 2 applications, another way to facilitate end-user transactions. But most importantly, the culmination of these two priorities has also led to the Coinbase Prime product, allowing management to scale the volume of transactions and services onto the institutional side as well. Coinbase Prime. This can be seen in Exhibit B below, which illustrates how the Subscription & Services segment has added some stability to the volatile revenue volume of Coinbase, which changes based on market volatility. Exhibit B: Subscription and services becoming an increasingly relevant segment to Coinbase (Company sources) The biggest revenue driver in the Subscription & Services segment is the revenue that the company generated from stablecoins, which was not as meaningful earlier but has almost tripled in 2023 and now accounts for almost half of the Subscription & Services revenue segment, as seen in Exhibit C below. Exhibit C: Coinbase's Subscription & Services revenue segment by sub segments (Company sources) This is important because most traders, especially institutional participants, use stablecoins such as USDC ( USDC-USD ) for moving digital assets or for other trading purposes, solidifying the management's three priorities that I talked about earlier, where utility was the second priority. Here is an excerpt from the FPC conference held last week: Stablecoins are one of the most interesting use cases outside of crypto as an investment. And what we see are a lot of funds, professional traders, others that want to need the ability to move crypto 24/7 around the clock from Exchange A to Exchange B preferring to use USDC rather than trying to move through bank wires and those sorts of things. And so, it's for institutions probably the single most important utility use case aside from investing that we see. In the same conference, management also mentioned that of the ~$330 billion in assets held by Coinbase, around $170 billion was due to institutional clients. ETF issuers were also an example of those institutional clients that moved their assets into Coinbase and used Coinbase's various products, such as its custodial services. According to its Q1 shareholder , Coinbase was the custodian for 8 of 11 Bitcoin ETFs. The crypto asset management market, where Coinbase offers its Prime product, is estimated to grow at ~22% CAGR . This is much faster than the midteens compounded growth rates that its crypto exchange market is expected to grow at. I believe Coinbase Prime looks poised to propel Coinbase into its next phase of growth. Coinbase's valuation indicates upside potential Coinbase management pointed to Q2 revenues being in the range of $525-600 million. With the ~1.6 billion worth of revenues already recorded in Q1, the company is on track to report H1 2024 revenues in the range of $2.1-2.2 billion, implying a 60% surge in revenue compared to the same period last year. I expect the SEC to approve the spot Ethereum ETFs within the next 1-2 months, which should point to the general availability of spot Ethereum ETFs on the markets in Q3 of this year. This should again give a significant boost to Coinbase's trading volume, especially from its institutional clients. Based on these assumptions, I expect Coinbase to report revenue growth of ~60% in 2024 over the previous year. Over time, I expect Coinbase to grow its revenues at ~27% CAGR growth rates. This is based on the growth rates I noted in Coinbase's two end markets I alluded to earlier. In terms of EBITDA margins, Coinbase demonstrated strong growth through last year on an adjusted basis, with the company reporting adjusted margins of ~33%. I expect these margins to dip this year as management sees more expenses in product development, client support, and regulatory requirements. But over time, I expect the company to scale margins higher on the back of an expected deployment of its institutional product portfolio. I will take a ~2.5% share dilution rate, while the WACC rate will be ~11.5%. This includes its current beta and other estimates that can be viewed here to calculate WACC. Coinbase has a favorable capital structure, with ~$6.6 billion in cash and ~$4.2 billion in debt. Exhibit H: Valuation model for Coinbase (Author) Based on the earnings growth rates and after comparing this to the S&P 500's long-term growth rates , I estimate ~15% upside to Coinbase's stock. Risks and other factors to consider I had earlier talked about management's three core priorities, where I mentioned how trading revenue and utility were the top two priorities for the year. The third priority that management has been and will continue to focus on is its regulation. Coinbase is one of the primary participants within the crypto regulatory framework, and the SEC has a history of litigation against Coinbase and other crypto participants on a broad range of policies in this space. Management has and continues to emphasize regulation as a priority to work with the SEC over policy work to bring more structure to the industry, which should aid its earlier two priorities. Takeaway Coinbase now sits at another inflection point as it turns its attention to acquiring institutional clients as part of its Prime portfolio and delivers progress along its three core priorities that I mentioned earlier. The company has already invested in building out its institutional capabilities, and 2024 was a promising head start that the company demonstrated in taking advantage of the momentum due to general bullishness in the crypto markets as well as optimism due to bitcoin ETFs. This again shows the ramp in revenue Coinbase has due to the opportunity that it has already taken advantage of. Keeping these perspectives in mind, I recommend a Buy rating on Coinbase.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4699615-coinbase-squeezing-lime-with-coinbase-prime?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29599733.jpeg

The fund primarily acts as a 'feeder fund' employing a passive management strategy, the product disclosure statement said.  The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), which accounts for 90% of Australia’s equity market, has approved its first spot-bitcoin {BTC} exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to a blog from the issuer VanEck.  ""The fund primarily acts as a 'feeder fund' employing a passive management strategy, the product disclosure statement said. The fund will provide investors exposure to bitcoin by investing in the VanEck Bitcoin Trust ('HODL') which is a United States ETF listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc (Cboe).  Earlier this month, Australia-based Monochrome Asset Management’s Monochrome bitcoin (BTC) ETF (IBTC) won approval from Cboe Australia exchange, the smaller rival of ASX. The company said that the product was the first and only ETF that holds bitcoin directly in Australia.  “A Bitcoin ETF being available on major Australian stock exchanges is a great movement forward for the crypto-space,"" said Blockchain Australia Chair and Digital Assets Lawyer Michael Bacina. ""It’s important to note the key differences between the products, as only one of the ETFs has direct Bitcoin holdings and can offer holders a redemption in Bitcoin.”  The blog said VanEck is ""launching the first bitcoin ETF on the ASX on 20 June"" and that it would be the ""lowest cost bitcoin ETF in Australia."" VanEck resubmitted an application for the product in February.  Reports in April said DigitalX Ltd. applied for approval to ASX in February, and Sydney-based BetaShares said it was working toward launching a product on the ASX. Bloomberg had earlier reported that the first batch of spot bitcoin ETFs could be approved by ASX before the end of 2024, making this an earlier-than-expected development.  Unlike in the U.S., in Australia, firms require the approval of the regulator, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC), and then the exchange listing the product. In May, ASIC told CoinDesk via an email that DigitalX Ltd., VanEck and BetaShares either had ""the relevant licence themselves or are working with another firm that has the requisite licence.""  ""Despite hurdles to clear in Australia, including regulatory and exchange framework challenges, along with ASIC approval, VanEck intends to lead the way in bringing the first Bitcoin ETF to ASX investors,"" the blog said.  After the U.S. approved spot bitcoin ETFs in January, expectations have been high for nations in APAC to approve such products as they continue their efforts to be seen as major crypto hubs.  VanEck also said that, given that it was one of the approved spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and had similar products in Europe, it plans to leverage its global expertise and infrastructure to offer Australian investors a best-in-class cryptocurrency solution.

""Alloy by Tether is an open platform that allows to create collateralized synthetic digital assets and will soon be part of the new Tether digital assets tokenization platform, launching later this year, Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether,"" said in an X post. The platform may potentially offer yield-bearing products in the future, said Tether in a press release.  The first asset available on the platform is aUSDT, whose price is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Investors can mint aUSDT by depositing Tether's XAUT as collateral. XAUT has a $570 million market capitalization and is backed by physical gold stored in Switzerland, according to Tether.  The aUSDT token is targeted for users who want to use crypto for payments and remittances without selling their gold-backed tokens, the press release explained. The position needs to be overcollateralized, meaning that the amount of new tokens users can mint is maximized at 75% of the collateral value.  Moon Gold NA, S.A. de C.V., and Moon Gold El Salvador, S.A. de C.V. will handle the asset issuance, which are regulated under El Salvador's National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD).  Tether's new offering followed Tether's efforts to expand its services beyond issuing USDT, the largest stablecoin by market value and a backbone of the digital asset market.

BITX ETF is not suitable for long-term buy-and-hold strategies due to significant contango and volatility decays. The Bitcoin halving event has come and gone, with little change in Bitcoin prices, as investors appear to have front-ran the event. With the Fed likely on hold for the foreseeable future, Bitcoin prices lack a meaningful catalyst to rally. The BITX ETF will likely continue to decay in a sideways Bitcoin market. The biggest digital currency news in the past few months has been the rather disappointing price of Bitcoin since the much anticipated 'halving' event. Since the April 19th halving, Bitcoin has been flat, leading to disappointing returns for Bitcoin-related investments like the 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ). Should long-term BITX investors buy the lull in Bitcoin prices in anticipation of another leg in the Bitcoin rally? In my opinion, the BITX ETF is not suitable for long-term buy-and-hold strategies because of its significant contango and volatility decays. Furthermore, with no immediate catalysts to drive Bitcoin prices higher, the BITX ETF may continue to decay over the coming weeks and months, as Bitcoin digests its strong move since last year. I initiate on BITX with an avoid (hold) recommendation. Fund Overview The 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF seeks to provide daily returns that are twice the return of the S&P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index (""SPBTFDUE Index""). The SPBTFDUE Index measures the daily performance of a rolling position in front-month Bitcoin futures and is rebalanced on a daily basis between the front contract and the next month's contract. The BITX ETF's current holdings are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 - BITX holdings (volatilityshares.com) Investors should note that BITX's 2x returns are achieved by holding 200% of the notional value of the fund's assets in the form of Bitcoin futures contracts. For example, the fund currently holds $3.06 billion in notional Bitcoin futures against $1.53 billion in AUM. BITX is basically a 200% leveraged version of the highly successful Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ), but BITX charges a peer-leading 1.85% expense ratio (Figure 2). Figure 2 - BITX charges a 1.85% expense ratio (Seeking Alpha) Beware Contango & Volatility Decay As I have written in multiple articles on leveraged ETFs, the main problem with the BITX ETF, and all futures-based ETFs, is that futures prices tend to be in contango , where prices farther out in maturity are more expensive (Figure 3). Figure 3 - Illustrative Bitcoin futures contango (cmegroup.com) So every day, the BITX ETF must sell expiring front-month futures and reallocate to the next-month future contract in a mechanical 'roll' process. For example, in the figure above, the BITX ETF must sell June futures at $65,945 and buy July futures at $66,460. This constant 'sell-low/buy-high' leads to a gradual decay in value for the BITX ETF. Compounding the issue is BITX's leverage, with 200% exposure to Bitcoin futures prices. Levered ETFs have 'positive convexity' in the direction of their exposures. For example, assuming an investor bought $100 of BITX. If Bitcoin returns 5% in a single day and Bitcoin futures are 100% correlated to Bitcoin prices, then the BITX position will grow to $110 (2 times 5% return). If Bitcoin futures return 5% on day 2, the position will grow to $121. This is more than twice the theoretical 2-day compounded return of 10.25% or $120.50. However, if the return experience is +5% followed by -5%, investors will end up with $99.00, significantly less than twice the 2-day compounded loss of 0.25% or $99.50. This loss in value is due to 'volatility decay'. While 'volatility decay' may seem insignificant on a daily basis, over the long run, volatility decay can turn into very significant slippage, especially for extremely volatile assets like Bitcoin futures. The combination of 'contango' and 'volatility decay' means that since its inception in June 2023, the BITX ETF has only returned 162.3%, compared to 94.9% for BITO and 119.8% for Bitcoins themselves (Figure 4). Figure 4 - BITX vs. BITO and Bitcoin prices (Seeking Alpha) The difference between BITO and Bitcoin returns is 'contango decay' (24.9%) while the difference between BITX and twice Bitcoin returns is the combination of contango and volatility decay (77.3%). Traders considering the BITX ETF should ensure they fully understand the tracking error risks involved with levered and futures-based ETFs by consulting these FINRA and SEC warnings. What Happened To The Halving Rally? In February, I wrote a bullish article on the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), noting that the upcoming 'halving' event could be a major catalyst for Bitcoin. For those not familiar, having refers to the fact that the reward of mining Bitcoins decreases as the number of Bitcoins mined increases. Original Bitcoin miners were paid 50 BTC per block when Bitcoin was first established in 2009. However, the reward rate is halved for every 210,000 blocks mined, and the 'fourth' halving event occurred recently on April 19th. Historically, Bitcoin prices tend to rally significantly around halving events (Figure 5). Figure 5 - Bitcoin prices tend to rally around halving events (techopedia.com) However, the current halving has been a dud so far. Since the halving event on April 19th, Bitcoin prices have been flat, and BITX and other Bitcoin-related investments like BITX and ARKB have done little in the past two months (Figure 6). Figure 6 - Bitcoin and related investments have done little in the past few months (Seeking Alpha) Bitcoin Prices Front-Ran The Halving Of course, two months is a relatively short period of time and the rally may still occur in the coming months and quarters. However, one reason for the weak performance so far could be that the recent halving event was well anticipated by investors, and Bitcoin prices may have front-run the event. For example, Figure 5 above shows that in the year prior to the previous halving in 2020, Bitcoin prices only rallied 37%, which set up a strong 538% rally in the year after the event. However, this time, Bitcoin prices rallied 134% in the year to April 19, 2024, driven by speculation about the introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming halving (Figure 7). Figure 7 - Bitcoin prices rallied strongly into halving (Seeking Alpha) So a lot of the typical post-halving rally could have been pulled forward to the months before the halving. Bitcoin Also Driven By Loose Financial Conditions Furthermore, while Bitcoin's perceived scarcity (i.e., halving events increases Bitcoin's scarcity) is a large driver of its valuation, I believe there are other factors in play as well. For example, I believe Bitcoin is also heavily dependent on financial market conditions and liquidity. Historically, there is a strong negative correlation between Bitcoin prices and the Chicago Fed's Financial Conditions Index (Figure 8). When financial conditions tighten, like they did sharply in 2020 and 2022, Bitcoin prices tend to weaken. Figure 8 - Bitcoin prices negatively correlated to financial conditions (Author created with data from StockCharts.com and Chicago Fed) The most recent up impulse in Bitcoin prices coincided with the Federal Reserve's dovish pivot at the end of 2023, when they hinted of multiple 'insurance' rate cuts in 2024. This led to a wild rally in all risk assets, culminating with investors expecting the Fed to cut interest rates 7 times in 2024. However, with inflation readings staying elevated, the Federal Reserve has been pushing back on rate cut expectations in the last few months, such that the market is currently only pricing in 1 or 2 rate cuts for the rest of this year (Figure 9). Figure 9 - Markets only expecting 1 to 2 rate cuts (CME) This modest reduction in risk appetites and 'animal spirits' could be another reason why Bitcoin has not been able to continue its rally. Looking forward, I believe the Fed is likely on hold for the foreseeable future, which means Bitcoin is likely 'stuck' around current levels as well. Technicals Suggest Caution Warranted Technically, Bitcoin spot prices have a negative divergence on the PPO Indicator (a measure of momentum), suggesting caution is warranted (Figure 10). Bitcoin prices are also close to breaking a steep uptrend, in place since October 2023, with a potential double-top pattern forming. Figure 10 - Technical picture suggests caution warranted (Author created with StockCharts.com) Conclusion The 2X Bitcoin Strategy ETF is a levered bet on Bitcoin Futures prices that suffer from strong contango and volatility decays. Due to the decays mentioned, the BITX ETF is not recommended for long-term investors. Back in February, I noted that the outlook for Bitcoin looked bright, as an expected halving event would increase Bitcoin's scarcity value. However, the actual halving event has come and gone with little movement in the price of Bitcoins. The issue could be that the current halving event was widely expected and prices have already front-run the event. Furthermore, Bitcoin prices are very sensitive to financial conditions and market liquidity. With inflation still elevated, the Federal Reserve has been reluctant to cut interest rates and further ease already loose financial conditions. With the Fed likely on hold for the foreseeable future and the major halving catalyst come and gone, I am turning more cautious on Bitcoin and its related investments. I rate the BITX ETF an avoid (hold) for now.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4699604-bitx-bitcoin-front-ran-the-halving-now-waiting-for-the-next-catalyst?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29598197.jpeg

29597613,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624981,1718631039,Metrics Signal Bitcoin Price Increase – But When Is Anyone’s Guess,"Bitcoin has been on a bumpy ride in recent days. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency has seen its price steadily decline, raising concerns about a prolonged bear market. However, beneath the surface, some analysts are detecting faint bullish whispers that could signal a potential reversal. Related Reading: XRP Whale Goes On Shopping Spree: 27 Million Coins Snapped Up As Price Dips Buying Pressure Emerges, But Can It Overcome The Downtrend? One glimmer of hope comes from the Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a metric that tracks the balance between buy and sell orders on exchanges. According to NewBTC’s analysis, this ratio has recently dipped below one, indicating a bearish sentiment. On several exchanges, the ratio is rising back above one, suggesting that the trend is recovering. This indicates a change in the psychology of the market, as more buyers than sellers are making orders. This is a positive development, the data shows. It indicates that some investors are seeing the recent price drop as an opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at a discount. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one metric, and the overall trend remains bearish. Exchange Inflows: The Other Narrative Another interesting wrinkle in the story comes from Bitcoin’s exchange netflow. This metric measures the difference between Bitcoins entering and leaving exchanges. A positive netflow indicates more Bitcoins flowing into exchanges, which is typically seen as a bearish signal because it could signify investors preparing to sell. However, the current inflow seems relatively low compared to past outflows, suggesting that the overall trend of accumulation might still be intact. This is the other part of the narrative, analysts said. On the one hand, increased exchange inflows could lead to selling pressure. On the other hand, the relatively low volume compared to past outflows suggests that some investors might be transferring their holdings to private wallets for safekeeping, which could be a bullish indicator in the long run. A Cautious Outlook Despite the emergence of these bullish whispers, the overall sentiment surrounding Bitcoin remains cautious. The price continues its downward trajectory, with the current support level of $65,000 under immense pressure. If this level breaks, it could trigger a further sell-off and exacerbate the bearish trend. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Struggles Near $6.30 – Is Now The Time To Accumulate? Bitcoin is at a critical juncture, and the recent signs of buying pressure and exchange inflows are encouraging, but they need to be backed by a sustained price recovery. Until then, investors should adopt a cautious approach and be prepared for continued volatility. The coming days will be crucial in determining the fate of Bitcoin’s current price movement. Whether the bullish whispers can transform into a resounding roar or get drowned out by the bearish undercurrent remains to be seen.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The biggest cryptocurrencies fell during the European morning, extending the subdued mood after the Federal Reserve trimmed interest-rate cut expectations on Wednesday. Bitcoin and ether both fell by around 1% over 24 hours, CoinDesk Indices data show. Bitcoin dropped to just below $66,000 – near the low end of the $72,000-$65,000 range it's been trading in for the past month – and ether was quoted around $3,500. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a measure of the broader crypto market, fell about 1.8%. Markets in many countries are closed for Islam's Eid al-Adha festival. Meme coins led declines, with SHIB losing 3.5% and DOGE dropping 1.7%.  U.S.-listed bitcoin miners reached a record market cap of $22.8 billion on June 15, JPMorgan said in a report. The bank noted that almost all the companies outperformed bitcoin in the first two weeks of June, with Core Scientific the best performer, adding 117%, and Argo Blockchain the worst, dropping 7%. The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell 3% in the same period. Bitcoin mining stocks gained in the first half of the month as investors reacted positively to news of Core Scientific’s deal with artificial intelligence firm CoreWeave, the report said. Mining difficulty also extended its fall since April's reward halving.  The Financial Stability Board (FSB) said it will undertake further work on the challenges posed by stablecoins in emerging and developing economies. The decision was taken during a meeting in Toronto of the FSB's plenary, the sole decision-making body of the standard-setting and advisory organization, according to a Friday statement. The FSB has been one of the main architects of global crypto policy. Last year, along with the International Monetary Fund, it framed a joint policy paper on crypto, warning against implementing blanket bans to mitigate risks associated with the sector. At last week's meeting, FSB members discussed areas that ""warrant further attention"" in the industry.

29594861,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=625017,1718625624,"This Altcoin Gem Will Overtake Solana, Predicts Arthur Hayes","Arthur Hayes, co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, has predicted that the blockchain Aptos (APT) is poised to surpass Solana (SOL) in prominence and utility in the race for the second largest Layer 1 (L1) blockchain behind Ethereum within the next two to three years. Hayes conveyed his thoughts during a detailed interview with macro analyst Raoul Pal. Aptos Could Overtake Solana Hayes indicated that the potential for Aptos to outperform Solana and ascend as the second-ranking L1 protocol after Ethereum is significant, but did not delve into the specific catalysts behind his assertion during the conversation. He promised a more detailed exposition of his views in September. The emergence of Solana in March 2020 marked a significant milestone in the blockchain landscape. Solana was heralded as a solution to several limitations of Ethereum, particularly concerning scalability, speed, and cost-efficiency. These attributes were crucial as the Ethereum network grappled with severe congestion issues during the DeFi boom, prompting the search for viable alternatives. Related Reading: Analyst Calls Buy Signal As Solana Hits Key Support At $141 Solana’s ascent in the crypto hierarchy was notably accelerated with the launch of the memecoins BONK in December 2022 and dogwifhat (WIF) in November 2023, both pivotal moments that marked the first major departure of memecoin activities from Ethereum’s ecosystem. Both memecoins not only boosted Solana’s visibility but also attracted an array of memecoins and innovative DeFi platforms, drawn by lower transaction costs. However, similar to Ethereum, Solana faced its own challenges at the beginning of the year with network congestion as its popularity surged, demonstrating the persistent scalability issues within current blockchain infrastructures. Aptos, on the other hand, has maintained a record of zero downtime since its inception, positioning it as a robust and reliable alternative within the digital currency ecosystem. Its foundation rests on the novel smart contract programming language “Move,” developed by engineers formerly associated with Meta Platforms Inc.’s Diem project. Related Reading: Solana Whale Shakes Market With $372 Million Transfer, Where Are The Coins Headed? Although Diem was ultimately shelved, the expertise and technological advancements have been redirected into Aptos, emphasizing its suitability for commercial use and potential for widespread adoption. However, Aptos has not yet been widely adapted. The blockchain currently has neither a popular DeFi ecosystem nor any major memecoins. APT Price Analysis This is reflected in Aptos’s market performance. Currently, Aptos (APT) has retreated 63% from its January 2023 high of $20.39, trading at $7.50 after experiencing a significant downtrend from its March peak of $19.48. The decline has taken APT below the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $8.39. The cryptocurrency’s trajectory has also seen it falter below the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA), now at $9.25, which has emerged as a major resistance level. APT has faced multiple rejections at this threshold, underscoring its importance for any potential reversal to bullish momentum. Moreover, maintaining a position above the year’s lowest price of $7.39 is critical to stave off further losses.

I am indifferent about the bitcoin debate, and I see the long-term potential of blockchain technology. But my focus as an investor: make money, don't lose big. I use ETFs like BITO and BITI to try to make money over different time frames, using my 44 years of risk management via technical analysis to make investment decisions. People love bitcoin...or they really dislike it. Few are in between. I am one of the in-betweens. While I see massive potential in the blockchain, as many investors do, I still fail to see cryptocurrencies as a long-term buy and hold asset. That doesn't mean bitcoin won't skyrocket in price at some point, and I would not be the least bit shocked to see it plunge to and through its depths of the past several years. So, I am indifferent on the aspects of bitcoin that so many investors debate endlessly. I just like finding ways to make money over multiple time frames. I chart 12 different time frames for many stocks and ETFs. And the range of ETFs I track is only limited by what 3,400+ such listed securities allow me to own. Or, rent, as is the case with anything crypto-related. I am an ardent risk manager, a conservative investor to the core. My number one investing rule is ABL: Avoid Big Loss. And so when first bitcoin proxies like BITO, and then spot bitcoin ETFs hit the market over the past several years, I was happy to check them out and figure out if and how they fit into my overall approach. And since BITO also has a fairly active, though not very tight (spreads) options market, I have dabbled there as well. But the other thing BITO has, as many macro-style investments I track do, is an inverse ""cousin."" BITO aims to track bitcoin moves. And BITI aims to track the opposite of what BITO does. And frankly, the ability to play offense or defense as I wish when it comes to this specific asset class makes me very happy that bitcoin exists. The type of volatility relative to the stock market exhibited by BITO and its peers versus, say, the average S&P 500 stock (RSP) makes BITO and BITI very ""useable"" tools to me. BITO and BITI: opposites attract me One thing I like about these ""pairs"" of long and inverse ETFs is that I can see the relative asset bases, and it adds another element to my sentiment analysis. Simply put, BITO's assets under management dwarf those of BITI. It is 24 times the size! Or put another way, if this were an election between 2 candidates with opposite platforms, BITO would be getting 96% of the vote. The contrarian in me sees this, as I have with other asset classes in the past (TLT and TBF for long US Treasuries, QQQ and PSQ for the Nasdaq 100, etc.) and thinks, ""There's an opportunity to potentially profit at some point in time by going against the crowd."" Seeking Alpha BITO's dividend yield: don't believe it! I was surprised when I first saw that BITO and BITI pay a dividend. Dividend on what? Bitcoin doesn't have a yield. This is a great example of when it comes to dividend information on ETFs, don't believe everything you read! Technically, it is a dividend, but is really just the mandated distribution of profits on the underlying futures contracts that power much of BITO's assets. Those contracts don't last forever, and when they expire, there is a settling up process. And so the profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends. Seeking Alpha So, a higher dividend yield on BITO and BITI (which works the same way) is that the more bitcoin goes up, the more BITO's dividend will be. I show the difference here, with the bottom of the chart showing the amount of BITO's gain that was technically a dividend distribution. Note that the dividend was zero for the ETF's first year, since there were no contracts settling and/or the price of BITO did not go up. Data by YCharts How I fit bitcoin ETFs into my overall investment process To be clear, while I don't buy and hold bitcoin-related securities, I track them continuously, but with a focus on price, since I am a technician primarily. As I've written here many times, my security selection process starts with scouring ETFs and stocks for the fundamental and quantitative characteristics I like. That leads to a watchlist of names I am willing to own ""at a price"" which includes inverse ETFs. From there, the ongoing ""blocking and tackling"" effort takes over, and I am willing to hold something for years. But much more likely, I will own it (or perhaps better stated, ""rent"" it) several times over the course of a few years. That is NOT speculation or day-trading. It is my proprietary process of risk management. And it worked well for me for 27 years, managing other people's money, building a firm around that process, and selling it to semi-retire at age 56. None of this is intended to be a ""brag."" I've made about every dumb move an investor can make...but always learn from it. And so when a new asset comes along, and the investment world is split on whether it is digital nirvana or an elaborate scam, I ignore both sides of the argument. All I care about it making money during the time I own something, and not losing big. No ""style points"" here. Now, to the charts! BITO is one of many ways to use bitcoin in my portfolio. But to consider it more than something to rotate in and out of takes more risk tolerance than I want to have. Oh, I will dance around BITO with very small put option and call option positions, but those might account for maybe 1/10 of 1% of my wealth. If the option went to zero, it would be like losing 1% on a 10% position in, say, an S&P 500 ETF. This is something I think too few investors think about. Position sizing. So when I see BITO with a habit of swinging 50% in either direction in a 3-month period, versus the average S&P 500 stock ((RSP)) fluctuating a fraction of that during the same set of 3-month time frames, I have to position size BITO and BITI (its inverse ETF) much, much lower. Data by YCharts BITO is not my ideal ETF when it comes to how it gets at tracking the price of bitcoin. But beggars can't be choosy, and this is a listed fund investing in an asset that isn't a business, can't be touched with our hands and which has attracted all types of players, from uber-wealthy professional investors to 2-bit scam artists. So to me, it is another reason to keep position sizes low. I know the swaps and futures industry fairly well as a former Wall Street broker and investment advisor who started in New York City back in the 1980s. And they have come a long way, and I realize they are necessary to create many of these vehicles so we can try to make money with them. But I tend to focus more of my attention on stocks of companies, and options on long-established indexes and ETFs. And I prefer this to a structure like that of JEPI, where the exact contracts used to provide covered call income are not fully disclosed. I prefer, and in most cases insist, on knowing exactly what I own. That's the whole advantage of ETFs in the first place. ProShares.com BITO versus Bitcoin price BITO did a fine job of tracking bitcoin before spot bitcoin ETFs came along. In fact, when the first 12 of those spot ETFs debuted back on January 9 of this year, I was like ""OK, whatever."" I have used iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), but BITO remains on my watchlist in large part because I can use it in rotation with BITI when bitcoin gets very ""whippy"" in its price action, and it has options listed on it, which the spot ETFs do not at this point. Data by YCharts Since IBIT debuted more than 5 months ago, BITO has trailed a bit, but not enough for me to take it off of my watchlist, for the reasons cited above. IBIT is also on my list, and I have bought and sold it twice this year. Data by YCharts BITO: Technical charts - this is where it gets interesting For those who think of technical analysis as voodoo, as many did for decades after my late father (a self-directed investor) taught me starting back in 1980 (with pencil and graph paper!), what I've written so far was the technical ""background"" I try to do with every security before it makes my watchlist. I need a fundamental understanding of what something is, and before I chart it for decision-making, I do the type of quantitative assessment of correlation, price pattern, volatility, and evaluating the alternatives. Now, it is time to get to the good part: am I going to rent BITO, or do something else? This daily price chart has a very strong pattern. Some call it a triangle or a wedge, but I try to minimize the lingo and just say what I see. I see a pattern I've seen thousands of times with many securities and asset classes. It tells me that the chances are strong that BITO is going to move sharply in one direction or the other. TC2000 (SunngardenInvestment.com) Before you say ""duh, of course,"" see how its volatility has been declining for months, and it is now reaching a point so narrow, it is bound to get more volatile soon. In which direction? Most likely in the direction it is currently going. I initiated a position in BITI recently (small, of course) because I saw the price of BITO break down through that lower line, albeit just slightly. But the indicator on the bottom, my favorite momentum indicator, also cross below 0.00, which means falling upward momentum. Put those 2 pieces of evidence together, and I saw a modest-risk situation to try to profit from BITI (lower bitcoin price), maybe for weeks or months, or maybe longer. I won't know until the chart tells me more. That's how I do things. But with bitcoin, I have seen it to be far less reliable in chart form, so I tread lightly, and don't try to overthink it. Below is a weekly price chart, and it looks a lot like the daily chart above. That doesn't always happen, and that it is the case here increases my chances of being able to hold BITI longer and make a bigger profit. I also will be considering increasing the position, if (big ""if"" with crypto assets) I can make a decent unrealized gain to start. That gives me the financial ""permission"" to try to take some of that profit and put it at risk by owning more shares of, in this case, BITI. But I'm not there yet. TC2000 (SunngardenInvestment.com) Here's a snapshot of the BITO put options market as of last Friday. Those are some big spreads, but I'm ok navigating that with, as noted earlier, a small position. I own a tiny amount of those July 19 expiration, $22.00 puts. Sometimes, I do this simply to have it on my screen in case it gets more interesting. I prefer not to ""paper invest"" because it just isn't the same as having some capital at risk, even if it is something akin to a nice steak dinner for 2–4 people. TC2000 I've owned BITO, but currently I own BITI. Here's why. I guess I could just say the charts told me so. And if the BITO chart looks good enough to try to make money on from its decline in price, that means BITI is a buy, at least tactically, and in small size to start. Here is the BITI chart. I'd call this early stage, but that 20-day moving average turning slightly up is my cue to take a shot at this early on. As we can see, it is coming off a fake breakout that did not last long in April. But to be clear, that fake out could have produced a buy of around $8.20 which sprinted up 10% to over $9 a share in just about 2 weeks. Again, this article is NOT about trading bitcoin ETFs. It is about reward and risk over different time frames, and how I apply this approach to everything I consider and own. So with perfect hindsight here, if I were up 10% in 2 weeks, I'd already be thinking about de-risking a bit because as I say all the time in my articles for Seeking Alpha, these markets are not like they used to be. Until a true up market that is more inclusive and less gyrating comes along, it is more likely one makes 10% in a short amount of time than makes 20% over a year or two. That's my strong belief. TC2000 (SunngardenInvestment.com) One knock on inverse ETFs, whether they be single inverse like BITI is to BITO or something derived from stock or bond market assets, is that the math works against you if you hold them too long. My response: don't hold them too long! With any pair like this, I expect that over time, the amount of weeks/months I will hold BITO will dwarf that of BITI. Inverse ETFs fade sharply if the asset goes up at a fast pace and/or over time. This is a basic element of ""playing offense and defense at the same time"" that every investor should learn if they want to invest this way. I've been investing in inverse ETFs since they first came onto the scene, so I have seen this in play for a long time. Data by YCharts At the same time, the basic role of inverse ETFs is under-appreciated by investors. The goal is not a perfect inverse. It is to have a way to profit from declines in an asset. And as shown here, if you owned equal parts BITO and BITI (""arbitrage"") so far in 2024, you actually made money on the ""spread"" between them. I am not telling anyone to do it, just pointing out that inverse ETFs are not as bottom-line as many views them. I see many uses for them in my own work. Data by YCharts Conclusion: I own BITI, but I am always looking to own BITO I've covered a lot here. And this article was part BITO and part using BITO as an example of how long and inverse ETFs can be used together, though not necessarily at the same time. As I see it, why settle for only trying to increase my liquid net worth on one side of the market? Every asset class goes up and down, sometimes for months, quarters and years at a time. Since the late 1990s, well before it was fashionable outside of hedge funds, this type of modernized ""long-short"" investment approach has served me well, first as a manager of other families' money, and now for my own. I'm holding BITI shares and BITO put contracts in small size now, but if that potential breakdown I see in the daily and weekly charts as noted above go from a hint of a big move south to much more than that, I am open to increasing my stake.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4699574-bito-bitcoin-etf-may-be-breaking-down-at-critical-price-point?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29594829.jpeg

Crypto markets have been laid low by a hawkish stance on interest rate cuts by the FOMC.  Bitcoin investment products saw a total of $621 million in outflows last week following mixed economic signals from the U.S, according to asset manager CoinShares.  Across the broader digital asset ecosystem, investment products saw net $600 outflows of $600 million, entirely driven by BTC's losses. This was the largest figure since March 22.  Grayscale's GBTC was the worst affected, as it often is, experiencing $273 million of outflows.  The outflows offset minor inflows for a broad selection of altcoins, including ETH, LIDO and XRP, CoinShares said on Monday.  U.S. inflation data for May, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), beat expectations when it was reported flat for the month. However, the good news was soon tampered by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve holding its benchmark rate range at 5.25%-5.50%. Its economic outlook called for just one 25 basis point rate cut this year.  Bitcoin was laid low by this hawkish stance, tumbling to its lowest point in four weeks on Friday at $65,100.  At the time of writing, BTC was flat at $66,000. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which measures the performance of the broader digital asset market, is 1.75% lower.

The bank noted that miners outperformed bitcoin on news of Core Scientific’s deal with AI firm CoreWeave.

The total market cap of the 14 U.S.-listed bitcoin {{BTC}} miners followed by JPMorgan hit a record high of $22.8 billion on June 15, the Wall Street bank said in a research report on Monday.  The bank noted that almost all the companies outperformed bitcoin in the first two weeks of June, with Core Scientific (CORZ) the best performer, adding 117%, and Argo Blockchain (ARBK) the worst, dropping 7%. The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell 3% in the same period.  Bitcoin mining stocks gained in the first half of the month as investors reacted positively to news of Core Scientific’s deal with artificial intelligence firm CoreWeave, the report said.  Mining difficulty also extended its fall since April's reward halving.  “The network hashrate, a proxy for industry competition and mining difficulty, declined ~7 EH/s (1%) since May,” analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote.  U.S.-listed miners have increased their share of the network hashrate and, combined, the 14 companies now “accounts for ~23.8% of the global network hashrate,” a gain of almost 1% on the previous month.  This was the second month of network hashrate gains for U.S. miners, the bank noted, and an encouraging sign that “inefficient private operators scaled back operations post-halving.”  Read more: Bitcoin Miners With Attractive Power Contracts Are Potential M&A Targets, JPMorgan Says",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/17/us-listed-bitcoin-miners-reached-record-total-market-cap-of-228b-in-june-jpmorgan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48eec5591e7c9011e7fb7d82ded673507d291273-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It will also consider the challenges emerging from higher levels of stablecoin adoption in the crypto sector.  The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which monitors the global financial system for systemic risk, said it will undertake further work on the challenges posed by stablecoins in emerging and developing economies.  The decision was taken during a meeting in Toronto of the FSB's plenary, the sole decision-making body of the standard-setting and advisory organization, according to a Friday statement. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the dollar or gold.  The FSB has been one of the main architects of global crypto policy. Last year, along with the International Monetary Fund, it framed a joint policy paper on crypto, warning against implementing blanket bans to mitigate risks associated with the sector. At last week's meeting, FSB members discussed areas that ""warrant further attention"" in the crypto sector.  ""In emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), crypto-assets pose particular challenges for monetary policy and capital flow management,"" the FSB said. ""Members discussed the challenges posed by the relatively higher levels of adoption and risks of global stablecoin arrangements in EMDEs. The FSB will undertake further work to consider how these challenges can be addressed.""

29586491,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624971,1718609405,Bitcoin Price Faces Crucial Test: Here’s What At Stake This Week,"As Bitcoin enters a pivotal week, market participants are closely monitoring several key indicators and events that could determine its near-term trajectory. Renowned crypto analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) has provided an in-depth analysis, highlighting the critical factors at play. Weekly Bitcoin Preview Ted’s analysis begins by contextualizing the broader macroeconomic environment. Last week’s US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) data were optimistic for risk assets, highlighting a continued disinflationary trend. “Both CPI and PPI data were optimistic for risk assets, with each showing that the disinflationary trend remains,” Ted noted. However, he cautioned that the Federal Reserve’s communication suggested that the market should not be overly enthusiastic about imminent rate cuts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $65,000, Expert Unpacks Drivers Of Crypto Market Bloodbath The focal point for this week is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and its revised dot plot. In March, the dot plot indicated potential rate cuts of 2-3 times in 2024. However, the June dot plot revision suggests a more conservative outlook, indicating only 1-2 cuts. Ted explained, “The March dot plot indicated cutting rates 2-3 times in 2024, but June’s dot plot suggests only 1-2 cuts should be expected.” This alignment between the Fed’s projections and market expectations likely provides the central bank with greater flexibility in future communications about interest rates. For Bitcoin, maintaining the $66,000 support level is crucial. Ted emphasized the importance of this threshold, stating, “It’s critical that Bitcoin maintains its support at $66,000. If broken, sellers could take a stronghold on the market and force quick liquidations out of the bulls.” This support level is seen as a critical threshold, with potential implications for broader market sentiment. The implied weekly ranges for Bitcoin and Ethereum reflect the cautious optimism among traders. Bitcoin is expected to trade between $65,100 and $74,100, while Ethereum is projected to fluctuate between $3,388 and $4,025. Ted highlighted, “This week is crucial for maintaining BTC’s (and by extension, the broader crypto market’s) short-term trend.” Related Reading: Financial Giant AllianceBernstein Predicts Bitcoin At $1 Million, Here’s When Ted also pointed out the performance of US tech stocks, particularly the NASDAQ, which has recently hit new all-time highs. “US tech stocks are certainly feeling the disinflationary vibes, with the NASDAQ breaking out to new all-time highs in anticipation of easier central bank policy to come,” he noted. This disconnect shows that something could be cooking for Bitcoin. Ethereum’s performance relative to Bitcoin is another area of focus. Ted suggested that Ethereum could begin to “play catch up versus Bitcoin,” particularly with the anticipated launch of spot Ethereum ETFs on Wall Street. This potential for Ethereum to close the performance gap with Bitcoin is an important dynamic to monitor in the coming days. Additionally, rate decisions from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) are on the radar. While no rate cuts are expected from these central banks, their decisions will be scrutinized for any indications of future monetary policy shifts. Ted mentioned, “It’s not expected that the Australian or Swiss Central Banks cut rates at this week’s meeting, but rather remain on hold.” ETF flows, which slowed last week due to market jitters ahead of key macro events, are also expected to play a critical role. Ted noted, “Last week saw slowing ETF flows on Wall Street for Bitcoin. Likely owed to jitters ahead of key macro events, it will be key for BTC strength that flows return in the week ahead.” Strong ETF flows are essential for maintaining liquidity and supporting Bitcoin’s price. In conclusion, this week is set to be pivotal for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. The interplay of disinflation trends, Federal Reserve communications, key support levels, and external economic factors will shape the market’s direction. Ted concluded, “The data is clearly pointing towards a shift to more accommodative monetary policy—and potentially sooner rather than later.

The token has dipped below the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a clear downtrend. Adding to the bearish outlook, both the conversion line and the baseline of the Ichimoku indicator loom above the current price, intensifying the negative sentiment. Related Reading: XRP Whale Goes On Shopping Spree: 27 Million Coins Snapped Up As Price Dips Polkadot (DOT) is entangled in a fierce battle with a relentless bear. Once soaring high with its promise of connecting different blockchains, the token now grapples with breaching the stubborn $7 resistance level. Over the past two weeks, it has slipped to as low as $6.16, stirring unease among investors. A saving grace might be found in the proximity to the lower Bollinger Band, which hints at oversold conditions. This could trigger a short-term bounce if buying pressure surges. Holding The Line: $6.20 Support Zone In Focus The next few days could be pivotal for DOT. All eyes are glued to the $6.20 consolidation zone, which will likely determine the course of the coming battles. If DOT can successfully hold this ground, it could establish a base for a bullish reversal, especially if it manages to breach past the resistance at $6.30. However, a breach of this critical support level could lead to a demoralizing plunge towards $6.00 or even lower, if the bears tighten their grip. Analyst Sounds Bullish Trumpet Despite Bearish Symphony While the current market sentiment surrounding Polkadot seems bleak, there’s a sign of hope on the horizon.. Prominent crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe sees a silver lining amidst the storm clouds. He views DOT’s descent towards the crucial support zone as a golden opportunity to accumulate the asset at a discount. $DOT reaching the crucial area of support and the area for accumulation.

Van de Poppe believes these factors, coupled with a potential breakout, could propel DOT towards significant growth in the years to come. Van de Poppe’s analysis identifies a critical support range for DOT between $5.67 and $6.11. He emphasizes the importance of establishing a higher low within this zone to maintain bullish momentum. The analyst also highlights two significant resistance levels that DOT must conquer for a triumphant breakout. The first hurdle lies around $9.30, while the ultimate test lies near $17.00, which would involve closing a price gap. Related Reading: Breakout Alert!

The $6.30 support zone will be the battleground where the fate of DOT will be decided in the coming days. If the bulls can successfully defend this territory, a potential breakout fueled by ecosystem growth and the RWA narrative could be on the horizon. However, if the bears breach this crucial support level, DOT might face a period of extended consolidation or even a deeper correction.
