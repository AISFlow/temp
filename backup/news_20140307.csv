42397397,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RqV,1394234682,$113 Million in Gox Bitcoins Believed To Be Moving Through Blockchain,"Large amounts of bitcoins previously handled by Mt Gox, which have lain dormant for years, have started moving on the block chain.  Since the exchange blew up at the end of last month, people have been wondering where the stolen coins went, and have tried to trace some movements between Gox addresses. One participant on the bitcoin talk forum recalled an IRC conversation between Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and various users, which allegedly took place on June 23, 2011.  During their conversation, Karpeles (a.k.a. MagicalTux) offered to demonstrate that the exchange owned large numbers of coins, by sending a uniquely identifiable amount to a given address. He sent 424242.42424242 bitcoins to a specific address beginning with 1eHhgW6vquBY. Sure enough, they showed up.  A few weeks later, that large amount of bitcoins was broken into two smaller amounts. Then, more transactions occurred, peeling off 50,000 bitcoins at a time into separate wallets, possibly as a means of moving them into cold storage.  Most of these 50,000 bitcoin wallets were recombined on 16 November, 2011, into two separate wallets. One of these contained 500,000 bitcoins, while the other contained 50,000.  The 50,000 bitcoin address was created on that date, and was then dormant until July, 2012, when it began receiving small transactions along with several other outputs. However, no coins left that wallet, until today, when its 50,000 bitcoins were sent to another address, as part of outputs from various bitcoin addresses totalling 180,000 bitcoins ($113 million).  Since then, these coins have been rapidly splitting, with coins being subdivided repeatedly. One branch was found to have been splitting every 30 minutes in what appeared to be an automated fashion. This suggests that there may be some code splitting the coins.  We don't know for certain that the 50,000-bitcoin address is indeed owned by Mt Gox, but it seems likely. The other, larger, wallet went through several transactions, with the bulk of the coins being sent to an address that was verified as Mt Gox-owned on the block chain.  The leaked Mt Gox crisis strategy document claims assets of 2,000 bitcoins, contained in a hot wallet, adding that the cold storage had been wiped out.  Why now?  So, why is this happening now? One explanation is that it makes the coins easier to use for a high volume of transactions. When bitcoins are sent, all the funds held in a particular address are sent, and the 'change' – the part that is surplus to requirements – is sent to a change address, usable by the sender. However, the block chain has to confirm that the change has been returned before it can be reused.  If you were to try and send bitcoins to lots of users very frequently from one address containing a lot of bitcoins, then you would have to wait 10 minutes or more for the block chain to confirm your returned change, before conducting your next transaction.  Core bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell also suggested that this was a Mt Gox transaction, based on interactions that he had with the Mt Gox API.  Maxwell also argued that the splitting behaviour is consistent with a function in the leaked source code from Mt Gox. This suggests that some of the coins have been dropped into the Mt Gox online wallet, and that the system is now automatically breaking them up, he said.

42397409,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RzM,1394230190,Bitcoin Payments Removed from Fancy's iOS App at Apple's Request,"New York-based social e-commerce website Fancy has removed bitcoin payments from its iOS app at the request of Apple.  The announcement was made in conjunction with its release of Version 3.3.0 of its iOS app on 5th March, and was visible under the ""What's new"" portion of the App Store where app updates are displayed.  Fancy has been accepting bitcoin since 23rd January, when it revealed the news to customers via email, thereby becoming one of the largest and most well-funded merchants to accept bitcoin.  The company announced that it would add a bitcoin payment option for both its Android and iOS mobile apps at the time of the launch, and had been enabling customers to make purchases for some time before the shutoff.  Fancy iOS app users confirmed to CoinDesk that BTC buying did function effectively prior to the update. Though, there had been hopes previously that the initial launch might represent a softening in Apple's stance toward bitcoin.  Wrote one interested bitcoin user in an email to CoinDesk on 4th March:  ""Either Apple's policy towards Bitcoin has changed [or] is changing, or they have made a special exception for Fancy.""  Fancy did respond to CoinDesk requests for comment, but did not elaborate on any interaction with Apple.  Apple's latest bitcoin snub  The action is unsurprising given Apple's notorious anti-bitcoin stance, one that was on display in February when it abruptly removed bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain's wallet app from its App Store.  That decision inspired the bitcoin community to erupt in a somewhat violent display of solidarity against the company's products, and led to accusations that Apple had abandoned its principles by turning its back on innovation.  Bitcoin wallet and merchant services provider Coinbase's iOS app was similarly removed on 15h November.  Community angered but unsurprised  The revelation sparked outrage on reddit, though users certainly found the company's decision consistent with its past actions.  However, Fancy is still accepting bitcoin payments on its e-commerce website for items such as artwork, clothing and furniture.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/07/bitcoin-payments-removed-from-fancys-ios-app-at-apples-request,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0cfe83b04940a69742a3cf15cdb42efe8b41a601-1025x722.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397405,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RyN,1394218928,Community Fundraiser Nets $7k and Counting for Alleged Bitcoin Creator Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto,"Noted security expert and bitcoin developer Andreas Antonopoulos announced a fundraising campaign on 7th March for Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, the 64-year-old California engineer who Newsweek has suggested is the inventor of bitcoin.  The funds, according to Antonopoulos, will serve as a small ""thanks"" from the community should Nakamoto turn out to be the founder of bitcoin. If not, Antonopoulos said the money could still be used by Nakamoto and his family to cover any legal or medical bills they are facing.  At press time, more than 12 BTC (nearly $7,500) had been sent to the wallet by more than 400 bitcoin supporters.    Standby, I’m setting up a donation address for Dorian and some parameters for how I will handle the funds.      — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) March 7, 2014    The news comes roughly a day after Nakamoto was singled out by a two-month investigation by the magazine, which is convinced it has found the reclusive inventor.  Late yesterday, however, in an interview with The Associated Press, Nakamoto denied any connection with bitcoin and marveled at the findings by the report author Leah McGrath Goodman.  More details  Antonopoulos suggested that donations will be open until the end of March, at which point they will be converted into USD and sent to Nakamoto. Should the funds be rejected, Nakamoto can elect to send the money to a charity of his choosing.  If no response is given, the funds will go to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit that protects technology rights and which is notably defending the MIT students behind Tidbit.  Antonopoulos indicated that he would personally see the project to the end, taking steps to verify to donors that moneys are handled appropriately along the way:  ""After the end of March, I will make my best effort to contact Dorian and deliver the donations in USD. I will document as much of that process as possible to prove the donations were delivered, as long as that documentation does not affect Dorian's privacy.""  Community reaction  Comments from the community were overwhelmingly positive, with many suggesting that this would be the right response regardless of the veracity of Nakamoto's alleged connection to bitcoin.  The project is not the only one that is aiming to raise awareness of Dorian Nakamoto.  Other projects include former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem's parody of the now-defunct mobile game ""Flappy Birds"", ""Satoshi Flight!"", and Bitcoin Financial Association member Bruce Fenton's offer to donate complementary plane service should it be needed by Nakamoto and his family.

42397402,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RvQ,1394216850,"Butterfly Labs Delays Continue, 28nm Monarch Delivery Pushed Back to April","Kansas-based bitcoin mining supply firm Butterfly Labs has announced that deployment of its 28nm Monarch mining ASIC will be delayed roughly four weeks.  The most recent setback means those who ordered units, some more than six months ago, will need to wait until April to receive their products.  Butterfly Labs informed the community of the news in a statement on 4th March, which explained that the delay is the result of an issue with the top metal layer of its chips.  Jeff Ownby  , the company's VP of marketing and corporate communications, elaborated on the problem in an interview, suggesting that this will be the last roadblock to delivery.  Said Ownby:  ""The metal [layer] as designed for [our] 65nm [unit] doesn't necessarily copyover to [the] 28nm [unit]. [...] Everything else that's depending on us putting together a final product is in stock and ready to go, it's just a matter of getting the chips back and putting them on the boards.""  Josh Zerlan  , the company's VP of product development, also moved to calm frustrated buyers, revealing they would ultimately receive a unit that boasts power consumption numbers that are ""better than anticipated"", and that some customers would be eligible for full refunds and delay compensation.  Announced in August  , the 28nm Monarch unit has been delayed since September when optimism was high that production issues would soon be ironed out. At the time, the company was already developing a reputation for delays and delivery issues, but said it expected the first run of shipments to begin in January or February.  The latest announcement will likely do little to quell concerns about further setbacks.  Performance upgrades  Though he acknowledged some consumers will be disappointed about the delay, Ownby moved to put the focus on the improved product Butterfly Labs' buyers will receive.  Ownby said Butterfly Labs expects the Monarch unit to consume 0.45W/GH, down from the 0.6W/GH originally announced. According to Ownby, this means the end result will be a chip that is less power hungry and more economical than those offered by competitors.  Explaining the significance of the change, Zerlan said:  ""To put this in perspective, this makes the Monarch chip nearly twice as power efficient as compared to our 28nm competition whose products operate between 0.9W/GH and 1.0W/GH at the wall.""  Delay compensation  In an attempt to assuage customers, buyers who ordered 600 GH Monarchs prior to a reduction in price on 28th November will be given the Imperial Monarch, a high-performance version of the card. The original asking price for the 600 GH Monarch was $4,680, but this retail cost has since been reduced to $2,196.  Individuals who have been waiting for less than six months for their order, but paid the full original amount will receive an Imperial Monarch, as well as a 50% off voucher for an additional standard Monarch unit to be delivered at the end of the current queue.  Those who have been waiting for their order for more than six months can elect to receive a full refund in US dollars or double the amount of hardware they ordered.  The post details:  ""This latter option will come in the form of (a) first shipping you the new Imperial Monarch, giving you an expected 160-175% of your ordered hashrate, and then (b) an additional Standard 600 GH Monarch at the end of the queue, giving you another 100% hashrate boost, totaling an expected 250+% of your ordered hashrate once all products have shipped.""  Customers who ordered the 300 GH Monarch at full price are now eligible for additional offers, though the full details of available compensation plans are not yet available.  Changing industry to blame  The news of yet another delay angered some customers, though others were less surprised by the announcement given the company's history of shipment setbacks.  However, Ownby suggested that these buyers should have patience with the company as it works through new issues. In his statements, Ownby evoked comparisons to Butterfly Labs' performance, which he suggested is on par with its competitors.  ""The only thing that you can do when you're talking about chip development in an industry that's unknown, is you give it the best case that you possibly can from experience. [...] I don't think it works out for anybody. Everybody who's tried to develop a chip has missed their target by some degree. You know it's just the nature of the way things are.""  Ownby said that his company has been under the microscope, but that this is due in part to the ""exaggerated timelines"" it works under.  When asked whether delays will become less regular soon, Ownby once again indicated that this would need to be the result of an industry-wide change.  ""The one thing that could come out of this at some point is if someone developed a chip and sold it off the shelf, but I don't see it happening.""

42397404,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RxO,1394214166,The 6 Best Pro-Bitcoin Festivals of 2014,"This is the year that bitcoin will really take off for lovers of fluorescent paint, camping in a field with thousands of smiling people dressed like Mad Max extras, and dancing until the sun comes up.  Festival organizers around the world are seeing that there is a demand for events to accept bitcoin as payments and, in 2014, they are starting to respond.  Here are six of the best festivals announced so far that will let you pay in bitcoin for your tickets.  Boom Festival  With a slogan: ‘No to corporate sponsors, corporate logos and VIPs, yes to independence, solidarity and creativity’, it is no surprise to learn that Portugal’s popular Boom Festival has decided to accept bitcoin.  The festival – which the organizers say over 100,000 people will attend – is to be held over the full moon from 4th to 11th August at Idanha A Nova Lake, Castelo Branco, Portugal.  As well as offering a plethora of rave dance acts – such as Juno Reactor and Carbon Based Lifeforms – along with performers, psychedelic art, gardens and healing workshops, Boom aims to be an eco event too, with the aim of having a minimal impact on the environment.  People wanting to pay in the currency will need to navigate to Boom’s website, head to the BTC payments page and fill in a form. Once completed, clicking the ‘submit’ button will take the purchaser to the BitPay payment page, where the transaction is finalized.  Lost Theory Festival  Keeping in the psychedelic vein, the Lost Theory Festival, taking place from 22nd-28th July in Deringaj, Croatia, promises “the finest installation art, visuals and decor” along with the “sonic experience brought by a fusion of hi-tech genres and alternative electronic music”.  Alongside dance and ambient acts, such as Justin Chaos and Chromatone, a ‘Dub Forest’ will allow festival-goers to “eat, dance, drink and relax to the vibrations of dub roots music”.  Those wanting to purchase tickets with bitcoin will need to email the organizers (bitcoin@losttheoryfestival.com) to arrange payment.  Lucidity  Lucidity is an “open-source transformational arts and music festival”, that will be staged from April 11th to 13th at the Live Oak Campground (see an interactive map), near Santa Barbara, California.  The festival offers seven distinct ‘villages’, each with a unique theme, and “a world class line-up of musical talent”, as well as local acts.  Paying for your tickets is simple: a button on the ‘buy tickets with crytpocurrency’ page directs you to the Coinbase website where the transaction takes place.  Vegas Loves Brazil  With a completely different vibe, in a radically alternative environment, the Vegas Loves Brazil festival is (surprise surprise) all about Brazilian music and culture.  Taking place in the Rio All Suite Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas, on the weekend of April 5th and 6th, this colourful event hosts Brazilian acts, such as Carla Visi and Banda Cine, along with Samba, funk and capoeira, and food and drink from the region (make ours a caipirinha).  How to pay for your tickets with bitcoin is a bit of a mystery, however. While there is a ‘bitcoin accepted here’ button on the ‘buy tickets’ page, the only payments offered at checkout are credit/debit cards and PayPal. We recommend contacting the organisers via the website.  Dig South  Part conference, part music fest, Dig South is “is the Southeast’s interactive festival celebrating innovation and the digital economy”.  The event is to be held from April 9th to 13th, in a variety of locations across Charleston, South Carolina, and the surrounding area.  The five-day festival will include a two-day interactive conference with “high-level presenters, innovative startups and the Wild Pitch event”, a two-day tech and creative industry expo, a one-day “Culturama” featuring the HACKCharleston Challenge, as well as national bands, comedians and more.  Dig South says: “The theme for 2014 is #mobilize. Conference presenters will explore the mobilization of digital tools, platforms and the global workforce. General tracks include technology, entrepreneurship, marketing, social media, gaming and ecosystems/culture.”  To pay in bitcoin, select the bitcoin registration tab from the festival website and follow instructions on the dedicated bitcoin page.  Porc Fest  Porc Fest, AKA the Porcupine Freedom Festival, is the flagship annual event of the Free State Project held at Roger’s Campground in Northern New Hampshire.  Over 1,500 people are expected to attend this “unique camping event” which takes place from 22nd to 29th June.  According to the organizers it is “a week long celebration of liberty” and includes campfires, panel discussions, presentations, movies, live talk shows, dancing, singing, music, food, parties, “all around liberty-loving good times”.  To register with bitcoin, simply fill out the form on the BTC registration page, fill in the form, and a bitcoin button will take you to Coinbase to complete the transaction.  With popular events like these now flying the flag for bitcoin, it seems it is only a matter of time before most music events and festivals will be accepting payments in the digital currency.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/07/the-6-best-pro-bitcoin-festivals-of-2014,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73fc6926f497d927221d8bd127c6bfa8ccb2957f-827x451.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397406,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4S0L,1394209847,"Hiding in Plain View, Too Much Secrecy, and Where Next for Space-Bound Twins?","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 7th March 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most thought-provoking and most controversial events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of scepticism and wonder.      Your host … John Law.    There’s a clue in the name  Even in the Internet hall of mirrors that has replaced much journalism, the story seemed too bizarre to be taken seriously. After years of rumour, speculation and answerless questions – could it really be true? Could this mysterious entity, known only from historical documents, claim and counter-claim, finally have stumbled into the light?  Yes. It is true. Newsweek really does exist.  That’s all that can be said for sure at the moment. Although Newsweek itself has made an equally incredible claim, that it traced Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto by looking up people called Satoshi Nakamoto, actual evidence is thin.  That the paper had found someone by that name living in southern California is undeniable, and he has led the sort of life that someone who invented bitcoin could have led. A 60-something model train obsessive who lives with his mother in secluded retirement after a career in secretive technical engineering? If it wasn’t for the fact John Law knows many equally qualified eccentrics – the tech world has no shortage of the species – it’d be a slam-dunk.  However, having made some initially ambiguous statements when doorstepped by the Newsweek reporter, Mr Nakamoto has most recently denied everything in exchange for sushi. Admirable man. It’s not really the action of someone sitting on a hoard of nearly half a billion dollars’ worth of early-mined bitcoin, which block chain analysis suggests belongs to the creator. But then, there are plenty of stories of threadbare recluses who die leaving enormous and unexpected wealth.  You can, in short, believe what you want to believe. And John Law believes that Newsweek’s mega-scoop falls some way short of sealing the deal it promises.  It would be entirely fitting if bitcoin, an anonymous system that works entirely in the open by hiding nothing, was created by an anonymous genius who lives the same way. But it doesn’t matter. Bitcoin as a once-in-a-lifetime invention stands apart, and it’s not as if there’s any reasonable expectation that its creator can come up with another; nor that, having invented it, the creator will have any particular insight into its subsequent career.  Like the admirable Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the web, the best that can be hoped for is a mild celebrity and a muted amount of influence in subsequent events.  Which means the converse is also true – there is no abdication of responsibility in choosing to exempt oneself, tick the ‘no-publicity’ box and vanish silently away. Privacy seems an awfully small price to ask in exchange for such a valuable gift, although fame rarely works that way.  If Satoshi Nakamoto really is Satoshi Nakamoto and not just Satoshi Nakamoto – or even if he isn’t – then he should be left alone unless he chooses otherwise.  Amid all this confusion, John Law trusts that this at least is clear enough.  That’s torn it  Further to privacy, there is news that a future version of bitcoin will use the Tor network for transactions. This will have the advantage, says the developer, that transactions will be not only encrypted but that their passage across the Internet will be untraceable and untappable – even by the NSA and GCHQ.  There’s a lot of truth in that: Edward Snowden’s copious notes from inside the heart of the NSA (themselves delivered to the Guardian and the New York Times via Tor) revealed that those organisations couldn’t crack Tor, didn’t expect to, and didn’t much like the fact. And Silk Road operated entirely inside the Tor network and proved untraceable – its demise came through poor security in the real world.  Although there have been various semi-successful attacks against elements of Tor, which works by shuffling messages between lots of nodes that only know about their immediate neighbours, it remains a very high quality guarantee of network privacy.  It may not, however, be a good fit for bitcoin. John Law has used Tor from time to time, not to evade detection or commit seditious acts, but by way of experiment. It’s not been a good experience. Despite much work by the Tor Project in building software that disguises the underlying complexity, it can be a frustrating business getting it going and quite slow in operation. You may have 120-Mbps broadband, but expect that to drop by 95%.  It’s also quite nerve-wracking. If you elect to become a node, which means your computer can be used by the network to relay packets, then you run the risk of being the point at which an anonymous, untraceable user’s requests finally decloak and hit the unprotected Internet. Which, if that user is transferring illegal images or other unmentionables, can lead the plod to your door with some awkward questions to answer. But without a lot of nodes, Tor doesn’t work well.  Bitcoin is already robustly secure, most certainly for the vast majority of users who aren’t up to anything interesting or dangerous and just want to use it in their everyday lives.  What it isn’t, yet, is particularly painless to use. It needs more simplicity before it gets more security: the two aspects must be in balance at each stage in bitcoin’s development to get the sort of widespread traction it needs to fulfil its potential.  Adding Tor right now, although John Law completely understands the reasoning, will not help the balance that’s needed right now.  In any case, if you want to use bitcoin via Tor, you can do so – just drop by the Tor Project and download some software. Give it a whirl. It will make your online life more private but – unless you’re a Chinese dissident or like annoying the NSA – not that much better.  As the Dead Kennedys said (ask your grandfather) – “Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death”. Human nature is as much a factor in network privacy as uncrackable encryption. It’s just much harder to engineer.  Space – not quite the final frontier  And further to human nature – it’s not that hard to see why the Winklevii twins attract so much opprobrium. Privileged, handsome and prone to grandiose claims that never quite got tested in court, their rebirth as bitcoin entrepreneurs can be seen either as far-sighted techno-economic acumen or another monstrous ego trip. Feel free to choose.  “I hope it’s one-way”, grumbled one of John Law’s less generous colleagues on hearing that the Winklevii had not only bought two tickets on Richard Branson’s “this year, I promise” Virgin Galactic space tourism plane, but they’d done so with the world’s favourite cyber-cash. Although he hates to disappoint the disaffected, John Law had to point out that since the craft wasn’t going into orbit, the one thing that is guaranteed is that it and all aboard will return to Earth quite swiftly – although in what state remains to be seen.  It’s a bit worrying, however, that the number of things one cannot buy with bitcoin is dwindling rapidly, which could lead to a price crash as the free publicity available to anyone in commerce in exchange for setting up a bitcoin wallet disappears completely. If you can buy cars, cannabis, politicians, plots of land, space trips, wine, women and song – what on earth is left in life?  So far, the only major asset not yet exchanged for the demon digital dosh seems to be companies. John Law ardently recommends this to Cameron and Tyler, once they return safely to land, as it may be their last chance to be really, really annoying in an innovative way. It’s probably best to pick an organisation beloved by the liberal chatterati: the Guardian newspaper, perhaps, or a micro-finance company working in developing nations with an explicit social remit.  The finder’s fee will be modest by Winklevossian standards – a mere handful of million dollars.  Bitcoin, naturally, is entirely acceptable.  John Law is an 18th Century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took 300 years off in a small cottage outside Bude.

42397390,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Rjc,1394204689,One Does Not Simply Find Satoshi Nakamoto,"Newsweek’s decision to out Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto as the creator of bitcoin appears to be backfiring spectacularly.  Nakamoto was quick to deny that he was the 'real' Satoshi Nakamoto and he attributed the misunderstanding to his less than perfect command of the English language.  He told the Associated Press that he refused to discuss his employment with Newsweek reporter Leah McGrath Goodman because he had signed confidentiality agreements, not because he was involved in the development of bitcoin.  If unfounded, Newsweek’s scoop could very quickly turn into a PR nightmare, as the magazine ran the report in its re-launched print edition. Perhaps Newsweek was simply too eager to get a scoop for the big day?  Back to the stone age  Newsweek is not the first publication to try and reveal the identity of the mystery man. What was so different this time around?  First of all, bitcoin is bigger and better-known, used frequently as headline 'link bait'. Secondly, this was not the work of blogger or a niche website. Newsweek has quite a reputation, or at least it used to.  Six years ago Satoshi Nakamoto was just another anonymous member of the P2P Foundation, so 2008 would be a good place to start. Back then nobody knew bitcoin would become a global phenomenon, so anonymity wasn't such a big deal.  Satoshi Nakamoto had a simple user profile and claimed to be a 37-year-old Japanese man. The community didn't exactly buy it, as certain details did not add up. His English was good and sometimes he used British English. Judging by the time he made his posts, the mystery man probably resided in the Americas, not Japan.  On the other hand, bitcoin.org was registered using a Japanese anonymous registration service and it was hosted by a Japanese ISP.  Several developers were working on digital currencies and e-cash technology even before Nakamoto published his bitcoin whitepaper. Most of them were not anonymous and even today there are people in the bitcoin community who claim that these crypto pioneers are the real Satoshi.  Nick Szabo  , Hal Finney, Wei Dai and several other developers were among those who were periodically named in media reports and online discussions.  They all insist they are not Nakamoto.  Media reports start to emerge  As bitcoin took off, the media started taking notice and another round of speculation ensued. In 2011 an investigative journalist identified three patent holders as Nakamoto. All three denied they were involved.  The same year, The New Yorker ran a story claiming that a few Dublin-based scholars including Dr Vili Lehdonvirta could be behind bitcoin, but once again the claim was followed by denials.  The list of potential Satoshis continued to expand. Eventually it started looking like the ""who's who"" of bitcoin. Founder of Mt. Gox Jed McCaleb was eventually named, along with several scholars, core developers such as Finney, crypto specialists and just about everyone else who could remotely fit the profile.  Interestingly, all 'suspects' were men – we're still waiting for the first female Satoshi.  Conspiracy theorists join the fun  Rampant speculation in a fact-free environment is an invitation to conspiracy theorists, thus a number of whacky and rather amusing theories have emerged over the years.  Some insist the DARPA is behind bitcoin, while others maintain it was created by the NSA, or any of a number of secretive government agencies that have the brains and resources to develop cutting-edge crypto technologies. One theory alleges the 'real' Satoshi is in fact NSA researcher Tasuaki Okamoto.  Since conspiracy theorists have a penchant for one-world governments and global domination, some claim bitcoin was in fact created by the IMF to serve as a global currency.  Others point to central banks, financial institutions or tech companies.  It doesn't really matter, does it?  Satoshi Nakamoto left the world of bitcoin in 2010, saying he is moving on to new projects. He handed everything over to the bitcoin community, the source code repository, the domains – everything but his bitcoins. Nakamoto is still believed to hold about one million coins, which would have made him a billionaire when bitcoin peaked.  A few hours after Newsweek outed Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, the 'real' Nakamoto logged into his disused P2P Foundation account and left a simple message:  ""I am not Dorian Nakamoto.""  Nicolas Mendoza from P2P Foundation took to reddit, saying the foundation is in the process of verifying whether Satoshi's post is legitimate. He said an official statement will be issued in the coming hours.  But in the grand scheme of things, does it really matter? The real Satoshi clearly does not want the attention – if he dropped everything in 2010, when bitcoin was still a geekish curiosity, he surely does not want it now.  The community loves the bitcoin mystique and if he ever comes forward, much of the romantic mystery surrounding bitcoin will be gone for good. Other than a few headlines, the world of bitcoin wouldn't gain much, yet Nakamoto would lose his privacy and peace of mind. In other words, it is not going to happen.  That said, he could make an appearance without revealing his true identity. After all, he seem to be pretty good at that sort of thing – and he wouldn't have to develop a proof-of-identity protocol to make it happen.

42397391,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4Rla,1394188530,"Japanese Government Says Bitcoin 'Not a Currency', Forms Investigation Committee","Japan's ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has launched an investigative committeehttp://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20140305/k10015738271000.html into bitcoin, and issued a statement saying it is ""not a currency, but taxable"".  In what has become a familiar refrain from authorities around the world in recent months, the government has also blocked related banks from ""brokering bitcoin transactions or opening accounts holding the virtual unit"". Exactly what constitutes a 'bitcoin account' remains unknown, but it presumably refers to one with a known bitcoin service like Blockchain.info or Coinbase.  This is likely a reaction to the international attention Japan has received after the collapse of Mt. Gox, which had its headquarters in Tokyo. Despite its hand being forced to make a statement by the Mt. Gox crisis, the Japanese government is generally curious about bitcoin and will not make any further statements on the matter until it has discussed matters with local bitcoin interests, a government representative said.  Representatives of the recently-formed Japan Digital Money Association, an advocacy group founded by Japanese bitcoin users and cryptocurrency miners, also consulted with LDP members with lawyers on Friday to present their case.  Obligatory statement  Bitcoin ""does not fall under the category of a currency"" as defined by Japanese law, Friday morning's statement noted.  ""Generally speaking it is subject to taxation if it meets conditions laid out in income tax law, corporate tax law and sales tax law, among others.""  Adding that there were no Japanese laws defining bitcoin, the statement concluded that if bitcoin was used for money laundering, ""that would constitute a crime"".  ""As a matter of common sense, if there are transactions and subsequent gains, it is natural... for the finance ministry to consider how it can impose taxes,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said.  Staying out of it  Prior to this, Japanese authorities and the nation's central bank had been silent on bitcoin, steering clear of the kind of warnings heard from other countries.  The LDP promised it would make a further statement on bitcoin and how the government intended to tax it in the coming week.  Bitcoin exchange Kraken also sent a message to the LDP's Chairman of Special Mission Committee on IT Strategy, offering to share the company's knowledge of bitcoin and the exchange business.  Japanese bitcoin users will have to sit patiently and wait to see what happens next. The government has not specified a timeframe for release of conclusions but will probably mull over the details for some time.

42397401,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RuR,1394179377,Satoshi Nakamoto Denies Being Creator of Bitcoin Amid Media Frenzy,"The man Newsweek named as bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto has denied any involvement with cryptocurrency.  Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese-American resident of Los Angeles, found himself thrust into the the limelight just a day ago when Newsweek reporter Leah McGrath Goodman claimed the anonymous, or pseudonymous, man who released bitcoin on the world had been found at last.  Newsweek ran the story on the front cover of its newly-relaunched print edition, but after being pursued through the streets of LA by reporters for a day, Nakamoto said: ""I got nothing to do with it"". Yesterday, Newsweek quoted Dorian Nakamoto as saying: “I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it ... it’s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.”  This matches closely what the 'real' Satoshi Nakamoto posted on the Bitcoin Talk forum in April 2011, when he claimed not to be involved in the bitcoin project any more and had “moved on to other things”. However, when Dorian went to lunch yesterday with a reporter from the Associated Press, he claimed his comments had been taken out of context:    ""I'm saying I'm no longer in engineering. That's it. And even if I was, when we get hired, you have to sign this document, contract saying you will not reveal anything we divulge during and after employment. So that's what I implied.""              ""It sounded like I was involved before with bitcoin and looked like I'm not involved now. That's not what I meant. I want to clarify that,"" he added.    Has the 'real' Satoshi spoken?  Earlier this morning (GMT), the simple denial ""I am not Dorian Nakamoto"" was posted as a reply on a P2P Foundation discussion thread by user 'Satoshi Nakamoto'. This user's email address supposedly matches that of the original Satoshi Nakamoto.  holy shit — i THINK the person who could be real satoshi just posted on how today’s satoshi is not the real satoshi — ಠ_ಠ‏ (@MikeIsaac) March 7 2014  Dorian's free lunch  Dorian was plagued by reporters yesterday, and when he emerged from his house he selected one reporter to take him for a free lunch and an exclusive interview.  hey @hunterschwarz pic.twitter.com/SQgRx1aoyU — Adrian Carrasquillo (@RealAdrianC) March 6, 2014  The two drove to a nearby sushi restaurant before driving to the Associated Press offices in downtown Los Angeles, all the time pursued by the media.  Does it even matter?  Whether or not Newsweek's man is indeed bitcoin's creator is unknown and will probably remain so, since he refuses to confess.  Many bitcoin users say the true identity of its creator is not even relevant. The concept of transmitting value via the internet has existed in theory since 1992 at least, when it was first mooted on the Cypherpunks mailing list.  Neal Stephenson wrote about cryptocurrency in detail in his 1999 novel Cryptonomicon. The issue remaining was how to solve what is sometimes called the ""Byzantine Generals' Problem"", or how to send a message over a link that cannot be trusted. Bitcoin's public ledger, or block chain, solved this. Users cannot spend the same coin twice and all transactions exist in public view to be scrutinized and analyzed by anyone with the time and nerve to do so.  'Satoshi Nakamoto' released what has become known as the Bitcoin White Paper (PDF link) in November 2008, engaging in a conversation with veteran cryptographer Hal Finney who received the first bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto and then went on to promote its use.

42397400,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb4RtS,1394179184,CoG Flies iOS Bitcoin Wallet Under Apple's Radar,"A Kentucky organization thinks that it has found a way to install fully-functional bitcoin wallets on Apple iOS devices, bypassing the infamously draconian vendor's app store.  The Cycle of Goodness (CoG) co-operative launched its iOS wallet, Pheeva, at the Texas Bitcoin Conference this week. The wallet, built using Bitcoinjs, is installed via a link mailed to users by the organization.  Apple is notoriously anti-bitcoin, having wiped several wallets from its app store, but Lamar Wilson, founder of LoveWill, a new software development firm affiliated with CoG which wrote the app, is confident that the co-operative will escape its wrath.  Wilson is a bitcoin believer. He even takes payment in the coin via his software development firm, 212ths. Now, he thinks he's found a way to install his bitcoin wallet without having to use the app store or jailbreak users' phones.  CoG, named after the management philosophy of a Japanese zipper manufacturer, gets around the app store restrictions using an Apple Enterprise Developer License. This license lets a company distribute an app to members of its own organization without going through the app store, for a relatively cheap $299 per year.  ""It's the same thing as us getting a standard Apple developer's license, but the enterprise developer's license enables us to distribute apps to people inside our organization,"" Wilson said. The app is installed using an enterprise certificate signed by CoG.  People have tried to distribute apps using the provisions of this agreement before. MacBuildServer used to compile apps on Github and let people install them, for example, which is how it got a Gameboy Emulator onto the iPhone. But then, Apple called it and said that it was violating the license. It pulled the certificate, and suddenly, there were a lot of dead Gameboy emulators out there.  Lamar hopes to avoid the same fate, because CoG is only distributing to members of its organization, he said, emphasizing that because members have to pay $10 per year to join the co-operative, the distribution is private.  ""We have talked to Apple about distributing as a co-operative. They said it's fine, it's ok,"" he said.  Did he tell Cupertino that the firm's single application was going to be a bitcoin wallet? No, he admitted.  ""If Apple reads it and then they change their terms of service, then they will have to change it for everyone,"" he said.  Wilson didn't provide a copy of the license's terms and conditions, and CoinDesk couldn't locate one online, although the description on Apple's enterprise development license site specifies that the license is intended for employees.  Wilson describes the CoG wallet as a minimum viable product, without any flashy features such as hierarchical deterministic addresses. One innovation it does have is Coin!D, a CoG mechanism to easily access bitcoins without handing over a bitcoin address. Another idea it's floating is redistribution of wealth.  Patronage points  Users of the wallet will earn 'patronage points' by spreading the wallet to their friends and family. They will then receive a dividend from revenues obtained by renting advertising slots in the wallet. CoG aims to distribute at least 50% of those funds to wallet users, based on their patronage points balance.  [post-quote]  Apple has a history of draconian unilateral action, however, and seems to have a deep resentment for bitcoin. Most recently, it deleted the Blockchain wallet. It's the money transfer part that it seems to have a problem with, having asked another vendor, Gliph, to delete that function from its own app.  Even the better-funded firms haven't escaped Apple's wrath. Coinbase's app was unceremoniously yanked, too.  What happens if Cupertino stamps on CoG? The co-operative will provide an 'exodus address' via email, which will enable people to forward their coins so they they don't lose them, Wilson said. And it has an Android app, a Chrome extension, and is mulling native apps for major desktop operating systems.  In any case, the app works as of today. CoG is providing free sign-ups, but the coins in your wallet will be sent to an exodus address if you don't pay the $10 co-op fee by March 21.
