42407055,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf99N8,1627686413,Kentucky Orders BlockFi to Stop Signing Up New Interest Accounts,"The Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions has become the fifth state regulator to claim that BlockFi's interest service violates state securities laws.      Kentucky's Division of Securities ordered the crypto lender to stop opening new accounts in the Bluegrass State. Kentucky joins Alabama, New Jersey, Texas and Vermont in alleging that BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIAs) violate state securities laws.      ""'BlockFi’s website offers cryptocurrency lending and borrowing services through ‘BlockFi Interest Accounts’ (BIAs) advertised on its website. Through these accounts, investors may deposit certain cryptocurrencies with the company in exchange for a specified interest rate.' The company has accepted nearly $15 billion in these accounts from investors,"" the regulator said in a press release.      In response, BlockFi announced it would ""immediately"" stop signing up new customers in Kentucky.      Existing customers remain unaffected. Kentucky joins Texas in filing for a cease-and-desist order, while Alabama, New Jersey and Vermont have filed ""show-cause"" orders.      The company has come under fire on allegations that BIAs violate securities laws because customers pool their funds with the company, which then lends them to generate profit.      BlockFi has maintained that in its view, BIAs don't violate securities laws in any of the states it operates in.      Many of the state regulators pursuing allegations against BlockFi have given the company an opportunity to provide evidence in support of its claim. New Jersey has given BlockFi until the beginning of September to respond, while Texas securities regulators have a hearing scheduled for early October.      Despite its regulatory woes, the company is still pursuing a $500 million Series E funding round ahead of a possible initial public offering, according to documents reviewed by CoinDesk. While the round was expected to close earlier this week, it's unclear whether it has done so.

During a panel discussion Thursday about the potential of the digital real organized by BCB, Mello stated that the move to digital payments will involve the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC), Valor Economico, a Brazilian financial newspaper, reported.      ""We understand that the use of CBDC will occur in situations where it is able to bring greater efficiency and transparency to transactions, whether from the retail perspective or its use by agents that make up the financial and payments industry,"" said Mello, director of the financial system organization and resolution division at BCB.      If they are designed well, official digital currencies can expand financial inclusion and reduce the cost and time of cross-border payments, Mello said, adding that the process requires ""extreme care in the choice of design and technologies"" to avoid violations of data protection laws, bank runs and cyberattacks.      Mello also argued that the use of digital currencies between different countries ""should be given special consideration"" to ""avoid unwanted substitutions of one country's sovereign currency for that of another.""      In June, BCB told CoinDesk that it was pushing for more time to roll out its CBDC.      “According to the current BCB assessment, the conditions for the adoption of a Brazilian CBDC will be achieved in two to three years,” the bank added.      Roberto Campos Neto, president of the central bank, said Brazil could be ready for a digital currency next year.

42407074,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf99fp,1627677301,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hits Two-Month High After Late-Day Surge,"After spending most of the day in negative territory, cryptocurrencies made a late surge on Friday with bitcoin hitting its highest level since mid-May. Bitcoin is currently trading above $41,000 at press time and is up more than 15% over the past week. Bullish sentiment has returned after a sharp sell-off in May and two months of consolidation above the $30,000 support level.      Some analysts are optimistic and expect buyers to remain active above the 50-day moving average, which is above $34,000 now.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $41,239.73 +3.66%  Ether (ETH) $2439.5, +4.58%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4395, -0.54%  Gold: $1813.5, -0.8%  10-year Treasury yield closed 1.236%, compared with 1.274% on Thursday.    “We have been talking about the market having lower liquidity during the summer for a few weeks now and we think this helps explain the sharp price action we saw that triggered the short squeeze of nearly $1 billion in futures liquidations,” David Grider, a strategist at FundStrat, wrote in a Thursday newsletter.      Grider stated that bitcoin’s spike could reflect a flight to safety from Chinese investors looking to “get out at any cost,” given the recent sell-off in Asian equities. “Bitcoin could have been trading as a proxy tool for investors looking for a hedge,” Grider wrote.    Next Fed rate-hiking cycle might be shallow    Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell assured markets this week that the U.S. central bank is considering when to start winding down its program of purchasing $120 billion in bonds every month, but Wall Street analysts are already wondering what will come after that.      According to Bank of America, the Fed may not get around to raising interest rates anywhere close to the levels that were considered normal historically, anytime soon. That implies that monetary policy could stay loose for years, even after the Fed stops actively printing money to pay for the purchases of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage bonds.      The dynamic might be bullish for bitcoin, because many investors see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against the inflation and dollar debasement that might come from easy-money policies.      A similar shallow tightening pattern was seen toward the end of 2018, when the Fed pushed the benchmark interest rate up to around 2.5%, traditional financial markets went into a swoon, and by early 2019, the central bank had reversed course and started cutting rates again.      According to the Bank of America analysts, bond market investors may already be anticipating the dynamic, which may explain why 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are at historically low levels of around 1.2%, well below the most-recent annual inflation rate of 5.4%      ""We think the level of rates in the U.S. reflects a market expectation that the Fed will produce only a shallow hiking cycle,"" the analysts wrote.    Bitcoin active entities    The active entities of bitcoin have surged over the last week, rising 30% to 325,000 active entities per day, according to Glassnode. The number has been in decline from January to mid-July.      Entities refer to “a cluster of addresses that are controlled by the same network entity and are estimated through advanced heuristics and Glassnode's proprietary clustering algorithms,” according to Glassnode. Active entities include those active either as a sender or receiver.    Ether resistance levels    Ether, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency, faces resistance near $2,500, where resistance is defined by the 100-day moving average. Ether is up about 10% over the past week and rallied nearly 30% after holding support at $1,720 on July 20. Lower support is seen at $2,000, which could stabilize a pullback.      Ether is consolidating relative to bitcoin and is on traders' watch for a potential breakout. The ETH/BTC ratio has initial support at 0.054, which must hold in order to keep ETH’s relative uptrend intact.    Altcoin roundup    Flow soars: Flow, a token powering a blockchain network focused on non-fungible tokens (NFT), surged in price after the big cryptocurrency exchange Binance said Friday it would list the project. Binance said at 7:00 UTC (3 a.m. ET) that it would list the FLOW token; since then, the price has rallied 61% to $29 from $18. On a 24-hour basis, the cryptocurrency is up 30%.      Framework to Regulate Crypto, Stablecoins: Legislation before Congress to provide a “comprehensive legal framework” to regulate the digital asset market and possibly grant the federal government the ability to ban some stablecoins was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday. According to sponsor Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), chairman of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee, the existing digital asset market structure and regulatory framework are too “ambiguous and dangerous for investors and consumers.”      Six Dapps to Go Live on SKALE: Ethereum scaling project Skale has announced which decentralized applications (dapps) will first go live on its network.

42407067,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf99Zv,1627676824,NYDFS Plans to Collect Diversity Data From Banking and Crypto Institutions,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is launching an initiative to promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the banking and crypto industries.      According to an industry letter published by NYDFS Superintendent Linda Lacewell on Thursday, under the initiative the department plans to collect and publish data from New York’s regulated banking institutions, non-depository financial institutions and virtual currency service providers that reflects the diversity of their corporate boards and management.      The issue of diversity in the crypto industry made headlines last year against the backdrop of nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, when the CEO of the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, announced the exchange was taking a stance against employee-driven social activism. Within a month, 5% of its employees accepted a severance package. Later in the year, the New York Times published a lengthy report revealing racist and discriminatory treatment of African American employees in the company followed by another report that claimed the company paid women and minorities well under the tech industry average.      Having considered a number of possible actions, the NYDFS determined that publishing management diversity data is the best way to support the finance industry’s diversity efforts, Lacewell explained in the letter.      “Given the limited availability of banking and non-depository financial institution-specific diversity data, making that information public will allow companies to assess where they stand compared to their peers and raise the bar for the entire industry,” Lacewell said.      The letter also said the data will be collected in the fall of 2021 via a survey, and its results are to be published in the first quarter of 2022, categorized by the type of institution and other factors.    NYDFS stepping in    In Thursday’s letter, Lacewell made it clear that applicable financial institutions will be required to participate in the upcoming NYDFS diversity survey.      “Under Banking Law §37(3) the Superintendent may require any banking organization to make special reports to her at such times as she may prescribe,” the letter said.      The letter explains the DSF will collect data from New York-regulated banking institutions with more than $100 million in assets and all regulated non-depository financial institutions with more than $100 million in gross revenue.      The revenue threshold does not appear to apply to crypto entities, but the diversity survey will also seek to collect data from all authorised virtual currency service providers including “BitLicensees” and virtual currency trust companies, according to the letter.      All qualifying institutions will provide data “related to the gender, racial and ethnic composition of their boards or equivalent body and senior management as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, including information about board tenure and key board and senior management roles.”      This includes Coinbase, Genesis Global Trading, Paxos and others. (Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.)    A timely response    The NYDFS letter, which included diversity statistics for institutions in the banking and crypto industries noted that female participation in the cryptocurrency community is very low.      “The percentage of women in the sector, including developers, investors and interested individuals, usually hovers between 4% and 6%,” the letter said, citing data from crypto statistics and services platform CoinDance from 2018.      That figure has since improved slightly: In 2020, engagement in the bitcoin community by gender was 86% male. The letter adds that 92% of venture-backed cryptocurrency and blockchain companies founded around the world from 2012 to 2018 had a founding team that was entirely male, compared to the tech industry standard of 82% for that same period.      On Thursday, as the NYDFS letter was published, the Black Women Blockchain Council (BWBC) a global benefit organization that aims to improve inclusion in the industry, announced it has partnered with ConsenSys to launch a global initiative to train 500,000 black female blockchain developers by 2030.      According to Olayinka Odeniran, founder of BWBC, of the small number of software developers who are specifically focused on blockchain, a smaller percentage are part of the African diaspora, and an even smaller percentage are females.      “We wanted to increase that number because we believe that being able to participate as a creator, as opposed to a consumer, is going to greatly benefit our community,” Odeniran said.      According to the new partnership, BWBC and ConsenSys will be launching specialized programming for black women in blockchain by 2022. The details of the training programs and courses are still in the works, Odeniran said.      Odeniran commended the NYDFS for taking steps to hold institutions accountable for what they say.      “While the public statements from Regulated Banking Institutions and Regulated Non-Depository Financial Institutions in support of DEI initiatives are significant and necessary, it is time to act on those words and make good on good intentions to begin to achieve real change,” the letter said.      As BWBC’s own initiative takes shape, Odeniran is not sure how the industry will respond to the diversity survey.      “I think it's a good attempt. Now, whether or not organizations will take it seriously, that's up to those organizations,” Odeniran said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/30/nydfs-plans-to-collect-diversity-data-from-banking-and-crypto-institutions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a5b9166bf3b1b6609ccedfd9e8c552e57f5b479-2510x1194.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Huge Bitcoin Inflows To Gemini As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, crypto exchange Gemini saw huge inflows earlier today resulting in a positive spike in the netflows. Before examining the data, here are some quick definitions for the relevant terms. The exchange inflow is the amount of BTC sent from personal wallets to the exchange platform. Similarly, the outflow is the BTC that was transferred out of exchanges to personal wallets. The netflow is just the difference between the value of the inflow and the outflow. When the value of the netflow is positive, it means more BTC is entering the exchange than exiting. Such a spike would mean that investors want to sell off their Bitcoin, and thus there is a selling pressure in the market. On the other hand, when this indicator is negative, it implies a buying pressure in the market as more BTC is traveling out of exchanges than in. Now, here is how the Bitcoin netflow chart for the Gemini crypto exchange looks like: The Gemini BTC netflow notices a huge positive spike | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph shows, Gemini has just witnessed a spike in the Bitcoin netflow.

42407069,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf99bt,1627670007,Fundamentally Incompatible: How the Proposed Crypto Tax Rules Miss the Mark,"In a potentially hugely disruptive move, a last-minute provision of a major bipartisan infrastructure bill moving through the U.S. Congress would impose stricter reporting requirements on cryptocurrency transfers, which the bill estimates would raise an additional $28 billion in tax revenue.      But the legislation, according to at least two crypto-regulatory experts, is so badly flawed it might be unenforceable. Specifically, the rule as written appears to define any actor who participates in a transfer of cryptocurrency as a “broker.” That could impose transaction reporting requirements on a strange array of players, including miners and decentralized exchanges.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The creators of software wallets could even be required to track and report user transactions, according to both crypto lobbyist Jerry Brito of Coin Center and Blockchain Association head Kristin Smith. Software and hardware crypto wallets, of course, do not record user information, which would make the law impossible to comply with.      The disconnect highlights the shaky foundations of U.S. attempts to tax or regulate crypto. There are at least two separate bills in the House of Representatives attempting to establish basic definitions, jurisdictions and standards for crypto regulation. Having those in place before trying to rush through a poorly conceived tax might have been a good idea.      The case of software wallets is illustrative. They’re fundamentally tools for interacting with a database, not tremendously different from a web browser. They are not services, any more than your leather wallet is a “service” for holding dollar bills. There is in fact no “service” managing bitcoin or any other legitimate cryptocurrency, a fact that fundamentally clashes with the regulatory framework legislators are trying to shove it into.      These flaws are particularly worrisome because the measure has been introduced as a revenue-generating element of the much larger bipartisan infrastructure bill, creating a rushed environment with little margin for subtlety or revision. On Twitter, Brito described the bill as “must-pass,” and said that Coin Center staff “worked all day [Wednesday] trying to fix” the measure, and continued into Thursday. The good news is the bill is still in process, so there’s at least the possibility for things to change.      Aside from their technical shortcomings, the new tax rules lean on near-universal monitoring and automated reporting, rather than on a privacy-protecting system of voluntary reporting, with investigation and enforcement for those who break the law. This potential law, much like the new European money laundering rules introduced this month, would likely create huge honeypots of personal and financial data to be targeted by hackers – including your data, whether you sought to evade taxes or not.

SHA-256 cryptography was developed by the National Security Administration. The internet itself was created largely by the Defense Department’s DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) program. David Chaum, one of the 10 or so most important pioneers of digital cash, earned a PhD at University of California, Berkeley in the 1970s, when public funding kept tuition costs to about $800 a year.      Most world-transforming innovations rely on a similar level of collective support, because basic or speculative research is usually not profitable fast enough for the private sector to invest in. So there’s nothing inherently objectionable about crypto being expected to give back to support the next generation of innovators.

42407072,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf99dr,1627669967,Money Reimagined: Can DeFi Stay Decentralized?,"How decentralized, really, is DeFi?      That’s a question sparked by Uniswap’s move to restrict investor access to certain tokens on its platform, seemingly in response to threats from regulators, and the topic of our column this week. We also explore the relationship between bitcoin difficulty and price and the meme fun that was had with Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) description of cryptocurrency developers as “shadowy super-coders.”      In our podcast this week, Sheila Warren and I were joined by my old friend and former CoinDesk colleague Noelle Acheson, who is now head of Markets Insights at Genesis, a CoinDesk sister company. The three of us picked apart a couple of prominent essays that were critical of Bitcoin and crypto assets. Have a listen after you read the newsletter.    The crypto founder’s dilemma – DeFi edition    It’s a question you hear a lot from crypto outsiders: Why did Satoshi Nakamoto choose anonymity? Why not write your name into the history books as a contributor to the march of progress?      I can’t answer the question definitively, of course. I don’t have Satoshi’s ear – not that I know of, at least. (He/she/they may well be among the many Bitcoin OGs (original gangsters) I’ve spoken to over the years.) But I do know this: If Bitcoin’s inventor was an identifiable human being or group of human beings, it would not have been able to grow as it has. In fact, it may well have died shortly after its birth, much like e-Gold before it or Liberty Reserve after it.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    One can imagine state or federal regulators knocking on the fully identified Satoshi Nakamoto’s door and hitting him/her/them with a cease-and-desist order for running an unlicensed money transmission business. The Bitcoin founder could have protested, “The network is decentralized”/“neither me nor my fellow node operators hold custody of customer assets”/“it’s code, protected by the First Amendment."" But the power of law enforcement at such times often means that nuances like that are lost.      There’s a lesson here for the folks who built automated money maker Uniswap as well as for other protocol developers in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry.      Uniswap is a decentralized exchange. Unlike centralized crypto exchanges and wallets, it takes no custody of customer assets. In theory, it’s governed by a decentralized community, whose members use its native token, UNI, to coordinate voting on financial conditions and other elements of the system.      But last week Uniswap Labs, the company that launched the protocol, announced it would limit trading in certain financial assets on its site. Citing “a shifting regulatory landscape,” the company restricted access to tokens that are synthetically linked to the value of stocks and other traditional financial instruments. The move came after U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler warned that stablecoin tokens pegged to traditional securities may themselves constitute securities that are subject to its oversight.      With this one outcome, DeFi is suddenly looking a bit less decentralized.      For some time, DeFi advocates speculated that regulators who’ve found ways to impose anti-money laundering, know-your-customer and securities rules on centralized, custodial crypto exchanges and wallets such as Coinbase would run into a dilemma with decentralized exchanges because, supposedly, there is no one in charge for them to go after. But Uniswap’s quick response to a regulator’s public comment is a reminder this was an overly optimistic view. The protocol might be distributed, but if there’s an identifiable, centralized entity running the interface with that protocol, and it can be pressured to block access to it, the distinction seems moot.    Regulatory test    It may still be that there’s a decentralization threshold beyond which regulators can’t or won’t intervene. Administration of a protocol’s governance could evolve to where it’s out of the hands of its founders and is guided by the decisions of its network, and so it escapes the scope of regulation. That’s kind of what SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman said in a much-cited speech about Ethereum in 2019.      If so, a big test of that idea may come with MakerDAO, the decentralized lending platform that runs the dai stablecoin. In a blog post last week, founder Rune Christensen said the MakerDAO Foundation, which runs the lending system, will hand over control entirely to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), also called MakerDAO.      As Christensen explained on our podcast recently, the founders quickly learned it was impossible to launch an entirely decentralized platform from the start. The decision-making of the foundation was needed for the system to run effectively at first, but the founders worked to build out the participation, liquidity and a structure that would eventually allow the protocol to run by itself.      Whether the formal move in that direction now is enough to protect dai from the stablecoin regulation that is also expected to be forthcoming is another thing. Legislation to provide a “comprehensive legal framework” to regulate cryptocurrencies and stablecoins was introduced in the House of Representatives Wednesday.      It does look as if DeFi is now very much in the U.S. government’s crosshairs.      Hot on the heels of Gensler’s message and the Uniswap response, a new infrastructure bill that’s looking to raise tax revenue from crypto traders included decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer marketplaces in its definition of the brokers from which information would be demanded.      As Anderson Kill lawyer and CoinDesk columnist Preston Byrne argued last week, the recent round of cease-and-desist actions by state-based securities regulators’ against centralized crypto lending platform BlockFi (see Relevant Reads below) may be a precursor to similar moves against DeFi. These agencies are viewing crypto interest-bearing products as investment contracts, and thus subject to securities laws, irrespective of whether they are offered by CeFi (centralized finance) or DeFi.       This is not to say DeFi doesn’t pose legal or even moral challenges for regulators. Many have argued that regulators are crossing some fat red lines by going after the developers of open-source code if those developers are making that software available to others in an open, token-regulated system and not taking custody of users’ funds or assets.      In other settings, software code has been recognized as a form of speech, protected by the First Amendment. And as Protocol Labs general counsel Marta Belcher has argued, some of these actions could constitute breaches of civil liberties based on invasions of privacy.      Still, law enforcement is coming. So, does that mean that the only solution is the Satoshi solution? Is the only way for a project to launch for the founder to use a pseudonym and stay in the shadows?      Sadly, that option may also now be unavailable.      As the Blue Kirby problem demonstrated, where a pseudonymous coder made off with investors’ funds, the market itself is now inclined to demand identity. It’s the best way for investors to protect themselves from a fraudulent founder.      Satoshi’s genius move to build something outside of the glare of public view may have been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, available precisely because so few people knew about it and because, to start with at least, there was not much at stake in the way of dollar value.      To me, DeFi founders capture the same inventive spirit that Satoshi embodied. It would be a pity if regulators quash their ability to turn it into something valuable and lasting.    Off the charts: diving difficulty    Bitcoin difficulty, a measure of how much hashing power is needed to mine a block of bitcoin transactions, underwent its biggest drop ever earlier this month. The cause: the massive reduction in hashing power brought about by China’s crackdown against bitcoin mining in what was once the world’s leading region for such activity.      The Bitcoin protocol automatically institutes an adjustment every 2,016 blocks, or roughly two weeks, to reflect changes in hashrate to maintain a more or less even spread of bitcoin issuance and reward distribution over time.      As the chart below shows, the recent massive drop in difficulty came slightly after the sharp decline in price from bitcoin’s mid-April all-time high of $64,829.       That’s a trend seen at other times of falling prices, as lower profitability can lead miners to shut down inefficient equipment, which lowers the hashrate, triggering difficulty adjustments. But if you look at the rising trend during the first part of the post-bubble price correction in 2018, you’ll notice that it’s not a lockstep function. It wasn’t until bitcoin took another leg lower in late 2018/early 2019, that miner profit margins were squeezed far enough to prompt hashrate and difficulty reductions.      In the latest case, despite the correlation, there’s also a strong case to be made that the price and difficulty adjustment relationship is at least partly coincidental. The China crackdown would have prompted a hashrate retrenchment regardless of price, though it’s also likely a decline in profitability accelerated the exodus by Chinese miners and dissuaded competitors from outside China from quickly jumping in to take their place.      The bigger question is: What now? Well, the lower difficulty rate makes existing mining less expensive, which means there’s a new profit incentive to offset the loss of a lower price. So with bitcoin back around $40,000 after dropping below $30,000 a week ago, and with Chinese miners starting to relocate to new locations, some could argue that the bottom has been reached.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Michael J.

The platform host some of the most important crypto trends, from decentralized finances (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and is currently in the process to migrate from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Ethereum has gone from process thousands of transactions to around 1.2 billion, according to data provided by Etherscan. The network settles trillions of dollars in value every year, said the co-founder of EthHub Anthony Sassano, who reviewed the platform&apos;s history to celebrate this major achievement. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $2,338 with a 636% profit in the 1-year chart.

Since last August, his company has financed its purchases of massive amounts of bitcoin using company cash flows, equity issuance, convertible debt, senior secured debt and a $1 billion shelf registration.      “Our point of view is being a leveraged, bitcoin-long company is a good thing for our shareholders,” he said.      Saylor also said that the notoriety that its bitcoin purchases have given the company has elevated its brand by a factor of 100.      MicroStrategy issued its second-quarter earnings report on Thursday, in which it said it planned to continue amassing bitcoin on its balance sheet. For the quarter, the company recorded an impairment of $424.8 million on its bitcoin holdings, since accounting rules force it to do so when an asset's price drops below its cost basis. But appreciation in an asset is only required to be reported once a gain is realized through a sale.      At the end of June, MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings were worth $3.65 billion, reflecting bitcoin's market price of $34,763 at the time. The non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) digital asset cost basis of those holdings was $2.74 billion, or $26,080 per bitcoin.

42407071,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf99au,1627663275,Did Laozi Dream of Blockchain?,"Much like modern-day, hardcore bitcoiners, the Daoist classic ""Daodejing,"" admonishes heavy taxes, strong governments and covetous leaders.      Laozi’s book, known in English as “The Classic of the Way and Virtue,” argued for a socio-political order that most closely resembles anarchism in the Western tradition: The best government is one that barely exists, a “shadowy presence.”      But Laozi wrote at a time when humanity’s organizational technology was fairly primitive. In the 6th or 4th century B.C., there were no tools to organize a society of free individuals without some type of government, ie. one group of people telling the rest what to do.    Eliza Gkritsi is a CoinDesk reporter based in Asia. Crypto Questioned is a forum to discuss the ideas and philosophies that drive the cryptocurrency industry.    “Governing a large country is like frying a small fish,” Laozi mused, perhaps as a concession. “You spoil it with too much poking.”      Today, we have blockchain, which might enable Laozi’s ideal system of governance to come to life.    Effortless action or anarchism?    The ideal ruler – and person – is one that embodies the ethical and political doctrine of wuwei, which roughly translates into effortless action, inaction or inexertion. It is a doctrine of doing without thinking, ridding one’s self of desire, such that one’s true nature can show itself.      Effortless action is the essential force of the universe, the Way or Dao. The world doesn’t strive with excessive force, it merely goes on. Similarly, each and every thing has its own way of being, its nature, its purpose, it can fulfill through wuwei.      The ruler who stops striving and sits still can “clear up muddied water.” When society is confused, muddied, with people not following their natural way, the government can clear things up by doing nothing. If the government is chasing its own deluded goals, individual subjects can’t find their own way to flourish as human beings.      Centralized authorities like governments can cause confusion by inflicting unnatural goals or expectations on people at a massive scale.      Not everyone is meant to run three startups while making gluten-free pasta from scratch every Thursday and hiking a mountain every other Saturday, meanwhile tweeting witty commentary and analysis every couple of hours. People often set these extreme goals because it is what our society reveres. And as we strive to achieve them we lose our ability to do what is actually in our nature.      Wuwei, an ethical and political doctrine, is about getting rid of this restless pace of living and unceasing desire to focus on what comes naturally. Perhaps that means fewer startups and more gluten-free pasta.    Read more: Bridging Cultural Gaps in 2021: Crypto in China and the US    The Daoist justification for minimal government is very similar to what 20th century anarchists such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Mikhail Bakunin argued: it is a prerequisite for the fulfillment of individual potential. Both streams of thought stand against intellectual and spiritual coercion.      Anarchists often predicate their arguments against government on the value of liberty. States and hierarchies are undesirable because they ultimately get in the way of individual freedom. For Bakunin, free markets constrained the peasantry, whereas socialism without freedom amounted to “slavery and brutality.”    Cryptodaoism    Cryptoanarchists and cypherpunks, the intellectual inheritors of the anarchists, have long looked to cryptography and decentralized technologies to achieve their ends. In his ""Cryptoanarchist Manifesto,"" Timothy May wrote about using technology to cut through “barbed wires.”      This attitude towards the emancipating potential of tech finds renewed vigor with blockchain. Crypto promises a future in which governments lose their coercive power because of a) cryptographically enabled privacy and b) decentralized tools that have rendered states redundant. In this future, the world is politically and ethically a-OK because individuals are free from oppressive hierarchies.      Under Daoist thought, decentralization gains new meaning.    Governing a large country is like frying a small fish. You spoil it with too much poking.    What better way to bring Laozi's dream to life than blockchain? This technology enables free individuals to come together and organize themselves under a set of rules, without a centralized authority setting them down the wrong, unnatural path.      But for the Daoists, decentralization is a metaphysical imperative. Its normative value isn’t simply emancipation. It’s the best organizational tool to stay true to the Way, and put wuwei on the wheel once and for good.    Two lessons    In my humble opinion, moving away from the ethical imperatives of liberty and equality offers invaluable grounding. It reminds us that decentralization has a fundamental purpose. It is meant to allow individuals to determine what is best for them and pursue it. It is a precious organizational tool that we must not take for granted just because it is ethically sound.      It is important to note that wuwei and Daoism later morphed into justifications for autocracy. Under the legalist strain of Chinese thought and particularly in the writings of Hanfei, wuwei was the doctrine of an absolute ruler without emotion. The internal stillness that Laozi advocated for was interpreted as unyielding strength.      Much like other political theories set on dismantling oppressive authority (you know who you are), Daoism eventually was used to justify exactly that. It is important that we don’t allow our thinking around blockchain and decentralization to devolve to the same point.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/30/did-laozi-dream-of-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57b95f50fd91d8db185585a249b53c4b5678c91c-1000x659.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407062,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf99U1,1627654377,US Stablecoin Regulation Could Lead to Geopolitical Competition,"Cryptocurrencies were created to become an independent financial system to counter the monopoly of nation-states. Trends such as decentralized finance (DeFi) have emerged as robust new offshoots to an industry that, until only two years ago, mainly offered only trading, investing and transacting. There are now a range of utilities around payments, digitally native financial services and financial inclusion that are moving from the abstract to very real in the crypto space. With the current fiat system of currency, underpinned by the Federal Reserve and the United States dollar, cryptocurrencies have started to separate state and money.    Tanvi Ratna, a CoinDesk columnist, is the founder and CEO of Policy 4.0, a research and advisory body working on new policy approaches for digital assets.    However, recent regulatory developments could push stablecoins closer to the existing fiat system, unleashing a competition among countries for control over a lifeblood of the crypto industry.      The current market cap of stablecoins has surpassed $108 billion as of July, representing ~7% of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Stablecoin providers are going beyond the utility of cryptocurrency trading. Their main benefits – namely, faster transaction speed, borderless payments, generally lower fees and eventually programmable money – already enable a multitude of other use cases today: remittances, micropayments, commercial payments, bank deposits and withdrawals, payroll, escrow, store of value, settlement, lending, wealth management, foreign exchange trading and powering decentralized applications. Being central to the development of DeFi, reserve-backed stablecoins such as tether and USDC currently dominate in most decentralized exchange (DEX) trading pairs and lending markets. Besides DEXs, lending platforms and other DeFi applications rely on stablecoins like dai and USDC to mitigate volatility in crypto markets and attract more investors.    Read more: India May Have Quietly Shown Its Hand on Crypto Regulation | Tanvi Ratna    The significance that stablecoins hold in the crypto economy cannot be underscored enough. If some stablecoin investments begin to lose their financial stability or value, that could cause considerable damage to the greater cryptocurrency market. We don't know if stablecoins would be able to liquidate enough investments rapidly to meet the unfavorable demand if a big group of stablecoin holders suddenly wanted to sell their tokens. A sudden lack of faith in stablecoins and issuers could cause the cryptocurrency market to experience a catastrophic liquidity shock.      Regulatory activity around stablecoins has intensified. In 2020, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) said stablecoins share the same potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks as other cryptocurrencies and called for revised AML/CFT standards. Later in 2020, the STABLE Act was introduced in the U.S. Congress, requiring stablecoin issuers and institutions to become licensed members of the Federal Reserve system and follow the appropriate banking regulations. The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) also met this month to discuss stablecoins – including their recent rapid growth, potential uses as a form of payment, and potential risks to end-users, the financial system, and U.S. national security, culminating with Treasury secretary Janet Yellen urging regulators to “act quickly” on regulating stablecoins.      The policy measures being considered for such regulation will bring stablecoins firmly under the monetary control of the Federal Reserve. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve co-authored a paper with Yale University proposing two major ways to regulate stablecoins. The first was to convert them into the equivalent of public money by either issuing them via FDIC-insured U.S. banks or backing them 1:1 with U.S. Treasury bonds. This is a similar system of oversight as with U.S. bank deposits. The other alternative suggested in the paper was to introduce an American central bank digital currency and taxing stablecoins, so called “private money” out of existence. This could essentially make a government-issued CBDC the de facto stablecoin of the cryptocurrency world.      Both these measures constitute a de facto “dollarization” of the stablecoins, especially the non-algorithmic coins such as tether and USDC, which dominate the space. Although stablecoins have always been measured in dollars, pegging reserves and compliances to the Federal Reserve will effectively tie down these global instruments to U.S. monetary oversight. This could reduce the cryptocurrency ecosystem to a shadow of the global fiat system today. Algorithmic stablecoins and DeFi might stay out of the regulatory loop for sometime but not forever. Whether they will be able to earn the trust of the average retail consumer remains to be seen. The collapse in pegs of algorithmic coins such as fei and iron have created doubts in recent times.    Read more: India’s Developers Are Web 3’s Sleeping Giant | Tanvi Ratna    Stablecoins might also not reduce to a monopoly of the Fed, if other countries retaliate. China, Russia and the European Union have all taken steps or voiced concerns to move past the dollar-dominant financial system. All three countries have also actively experimented with and regulated cryptocurrencies or built their own digital currency. It is very likely that if U.S.-bank or Treasurys-backed stablecoins emerge, these countries will issue stablecoins backed by their own currencies into the wider cryptocurrency market. Both CBDCs and private and public-private stablecoins denominated in different currencies could emerge as a counter to U.S.-centered regulation of stablecoins.      A critical component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem could, hence, either become a shadow of the existing system or a battleground of intense geopolitical currency wars. In either case, in remaining a pillar of an independent financial cryptocurrency-based system, stablecoins face a considerable challenge.",NEUTRAL,USDC,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | USDC,Tanvi Ratna,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/30/us-stablecoin-regulation-could-lead-to-geopolitical-competition,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3361047726a6af0fdb8d91d7f9826a8f648fb65c-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance said at 7:00 UTC (3 a.m. ET) that it would list the FLOW token; since then, the price has rallied to $29 from $18, a 61% rise. On a 24-hour basis, the cryptocurrency is up 30%.    The token began the day at $18.26 and climbed to $27.56 after the announcement from Binance, according to data from Messari.  FLOW's market value jumped to $1.23 billion.  Flow is a blockchain built to support gaming applications and digital assets.  The ecosystem is a product of Dapper Labs, the company behind the CryptoKitties blockchain game and NBA Top Shot, which allows fans to buy, sell and trade officially licensed video highlights of National Basketball Association moments.  Flow’s rally after Binance’s announcement could be a sign the market still sees the exchange as a major player, despite recent regulatory crackdowns.  Binance is still the leading crypto exchange in terms of spot and derivative market volumes and futures market open interest. So the listing could provide access for a larger swath of traders to buy or sell the FLOW token.

American crypto traders are getting round measures that are supposed to block them from using offshore exchanges such as FTX and Binance, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing research by data firm Inca Digital.  U.S.-based traders are able to use virtual private networks designed to mask the country where they are based. Or they simply lie about where they are from.  Inca's technology is used by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the body that regulates derivatives trading in the U.S. Offshore exchanges operate outside of the CFTC's purview and can avoid some of the rules relating to investor protection and market manipulation.  The research was conducted by scanning Twitter for exultant tweets about successful trades and so on.  Inca found 2,000 such tweets, of which 372 belonged to Americans. It is likely this represents only a tiny proportion of the total number, the Journal said.  Of the 372, 240 were using FTX, prompting the Hong Kong-based exchange to say it will tighten its procedures to block U.S. users.  Until this week, FTX users were able to gain entry-level access with a daily withdrawal limit of $9,000 without needing to provide identification documents.

42407053,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf96wb,1627643030,Bitcoin Drops After $1.6B Monthly Options Expiry,"Bitcoin faced selling pressure on Friday after Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange by volume and open interest, settled monthly options contracts worth $1.6 billion.      The cryptocurrency slipped from $39,800 to $38,500 after 08:00 UTC (4 a.m. ET), the designated settlement time on Deribit. A total of 41,000 contracts expired, of which 22,000 were calls options, and the rest were put options, according to Deribit data.      While the exact nature of the expiry-related flows is not known yet, prices frequently become more volatile after expiry.      Option expiries have gained prominence this year, with the cryptocurrency gravitating toward the so-called max pain point in the lead-up to settlement, and seeing notable directional activity post-expiry. That point is the strike price at which the most open options contracts expire worthlessly. Sellers, typically institutions, try to push prices closer to the max pain point to minimize their losses.      ""There is always additional activity before and just after the expiry, especially for relatively larger ones like the July expiry,"" Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, told CoinDesk.      During the bull run, bitcoin consistently saw pullbacks toward the max pain point ahead of expiry and resumed gains following settlement, as seen below.      ""When BTC was bullish, we'd see a sell-off & volatility increase during expiry week, then pump at expiry,"" an options and algo trader who goes as Altcoin Psycho tweeted Thursday. ""This time, it's been the opposite. If price dumps after expiry, that may be a sign that we go lower.""      The overall market mood has been bearish since the beginning of the month, and prices dipped below the critical support of $30,000 on July 20. The cryptocurrency bounced well above the July expiry max pain point of $35,000 earlier this week, and is again facing downward pressure after the expiry.      Data shared by analytics firm Laevitas via Discord shows there has been notable call-option selling at higher strikes after 08:00 UTC.      Investors typically sell calls, which offer insurance against bullish moves, when the underlying asset is expected to drop or consolidate.      A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option gives the right to sell.      Bullish flows may return if the cryptocurrency establishes a foothold above the 100-day moving average (SMA) of $40,000. The average has been capping gains since Wednesday.

Separately, the cryptocurrency exchange said it's planning to wind down futures and derivatives products across Europe, starting with Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.    Malaysia's Securities Commission (SC) issued a public reprimand against the company and ordered it to disable the website and mobile apps in the country.  According to the commission, Binance is ""illegally operating a digital asset exchange."" The country's laws demand that all such exchanges must be registered by the SC.  Binance also needs to halt marketing activities and prevent Malaysian investors accessing its Telegram group.  In Europe, Binance said users in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands will be unable to open new futures and derivative positions on the platform, effective immediately.  Existing positions will have to be closed by an as-yet undetermined date.  The decision is Binance's latest move to distance itself from products and services that have drawn the scrutiny from regulators in a slew of different markets.  Earlier this week, Binance announced it was stopping crypto margin trading involving sterling, the euro and Australian dollar. This followed just hours after CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted the company was reducing the maximum leverage users can use to trade futures contracts from 100x to 20x.  Binance has fallen foul of Malaysia's markets regulator in the past. Along with eToro, it was added to a list of companies not permitted to operate in the country in July last year.

Loda attracted more than 15 investors who poured $15 million into the lender's first of three completed institutional liquidity pools, according to a press release on Friday,      The two remaining pools, which are still live, will be completed once demand calls for it, Dion Dalton-Bridges, CEO and founder of Loda, told CoinDesk via Telegram.      Participation in the first liquidity pool came from Framework Ventures, Spartan Capital, One Block, Mechanism Capital, Liquefy Labs, Apollo Capital, Maven 11, Ledger Prime, Cluster Capital, Signum Capital, X21 and others.      Loda's initial iteration is one of the first of its kind in the country allowing users ""one of the only ways"" to borrow Australian dollars against crypto, Dalton-Bridges said.      The platform allows users to park their crypto assets on the platform in exchange for dollars as a means of accessing capital.      While banks don't accept crypto as collateral to borrow money for a home, car, boat or trip, Loda is attempting to provide its users the means to do just that.      ""An example of a traditional collateralized loan is when someone uses a house to borrow more money. All that is happening here is we are introducing a new form of collateral, which is the crypto itself,"" Dalton-Bridges said.      Those who believe in cryptocurrency as a long-term investment may borrow the cash in the short-term and still benefit, as the person who takes the loan ""still captures all the potential upside"" of an appreciating crypto's price.      ""This is appealing to crypto holders who want access to cash but don’t want to sell,"" Dalton-Bridges said. ""The benefits of borrowing against crypto are namely that you are not selling your crypto but are still able to access cash in the here and now, and at low-interest rates.""      The founder estimates a flat rate across all loans will be placed somewhere in the 5% range once the platform goes live in August.

ARK, which actively trades shares, is heavily invested in crypto and blockchain-centric businesses.  In April, the firm made a significant purchase in Coinbase's stock shortly after the crypto exchange made its Nasdaq debut.

Central Bank of Ireland Governor Gabriel Makhlouf said that although the eurozone has yet to decide on a central bank digital currency, the development is ""very likely"" to happen.  ""In my view, it's not a question of if but rather how and when,"" the governor wrote in a bank blog post on Thursday.  Introducing a digital euro would represent a ""fundamental shift"" in the financial architecture of the eurozone, Makhlouf noted.  The governor was less kind to cryptos, which he said were accompanied by an ""unhelpful and misleading descriptor,"" as they don't fall under the definition of a currency.  Some cryptos have no anchor to provide stability, Makhlouf wrote, but he added that ""on the other hand, on the evidence some people do like to collect them, just as some like to collect other things (such as stamps, for example). Buying such items can be profitable, but it can also be loss-making.""  Makhlouf also took aim at stablecoins, saying the cryptos that are pegged to a stable currency like the U.S. dollar were only ""as good as the governance behind the promise of the backing.""  The governor, who became governor of Ireland's central bank in September 2019, is a British economist. He was previously the New Zealand Treasury's secretary and chief executive, according to his LinkedIn page.  In March, Ireland's central bank warned that companies operating in the republic would have to comply with anti-money laundering rules, and in May, it warned investors about the risk of cryptos.
