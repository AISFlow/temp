42399746,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyboS,1492264893,Is Safe Haven Scarcity Becoming a Boon For Bitcoin?,"While the strict regulations that emerged following the 2007–2008 financial crisis drew fire from many industry participants, they may have had an unintended consequence: making bitcoin more appealing to investors.  Following the crisis, regulators created a complex framework of rules and regulations designed to ensure the continued stability of the global financial system. The new framework affected many different facets of the financial services industry, including financial institutions involved in trading.  Under the new rules, investors frequently need to deposit cash (known as 'margin') when making trades. This margin is often left at clearinghouses, which act as intermediaries and help ensure that trades still take place even if one party gets cold feet.  These clearinghouses then take this cash and lend it out for safe assets, such as German bunds or US Treasury bonds, through the repurchase agreement or 'repo' market, which enables them to make short-term loans.  This entire process has had the effect of making certain safe assets – specifically high-quality government bonds – increasingly scarce.  And this situation could potentially grow more severe, Yves Mersch, member of the European Central Bank's Executive Board, warned recently.  He stated during a January speech:  ""The requirements for trades to be centrally cleared are still being introduced, so the demand from market infrastructure to exchange cash for collateral will rise.""  While clearinghouses have been snapping up safe assets, they are certainly not alone in this respect. Central banks around the world have been acting similarly, purchasing trillions of dollars worth of bonds following the financial crisis.  One major objective of this quantitative easing (QE) was placing downward pressure on interest rates in an attempt to bolster lending and stimulate economic growth.  These efforts have been largely successful, as interest rates have stayed very low for several years.  The search for yield  While QE has helped create an environment of low interest rates (and therefore modest borrowing costs), it has had an unintended consequence of placing downward pressure on yields.  The current environment has caused many investors to embark upon a search for yield, which in turn has drawn investors to bitcoin, according to several analysts who spoke with CoinDesk.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, spoke to this aspect of the digital currency, saying, ""It's not so much a shortage of safe haven assets, so much as low yields in all asset classes"" that makes bitcoin appealing.  The low-yield environment is ""driving the appetite for crypto currencies across the board"", he added.  Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, also spoke to the key need created by the current lack of high-yielding investment opportunities, as well as how he believes the situation is fueling demand for bitcoin:  ""The search for yield has no such obvious answers and I expect that is driving some of the interest.""  Disaster hedge  Bitcoin prices have frequently enjoyed tailwinds during times of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. As a result, the capital markets have come to understand bitcoin's value as a ""disaster hedge,"" ARK Invest analyst Chris Burniske told CoinDesk.  Should the economy fall into recession, or the stock market decline, bitcoin prices could benefit significantly. While investors tend to seek out safer securities during times of economic turmoil, the general lack of such assets could prompt them to flock to bitcoin instead.  Harry Yeh, managing partner of investment manager Binary Financial, has been preparing for such an event, recently telling CoinDesk: ""Our new fund specifically targets high net worth clients and institutions so they can park their money in an alternative asset.""  He continued:  ""Cryptocurrencies are seen as a safe haven asset now from global macroeconomic events such as currency devaluation or even events like the 'Brexit'.""  Other analysts offered a more complicated assessment, with Eliosoff emphasizing that, while a downturn would ""likely"" provide bitcoin with tailwinds, it might depend on what factors caused the downturn to materialize in the first place.  Michael Moro, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, added further detail to the situation, emphasizing that ""safe"" is a relative term. He also noted that geography can play a key role in investors' decisions.  Moro stated:  ""If I am a US investor, I am sure that there are plenty of other assets that would be viewed as safe before getting to bitcoin. But if I am located elsewhere with more economic instability, bitcoin may very well be one of the first options.""  Historically, bitcoin prices have not correlatedhttps://ark-invest.com/thought-leadership with those of other assets – a point raised by Moro.  Should a recession or financial crisis take place, this is another aspect that could make the digital currency very attractive. During times of crisis, investors frequently panic, selling off many different assets and causing several different kinds of securities to lose value simultaneously.  Should such panic selling take place, investors may find that bitcoin, with its status as as a unique and uncorrelated asset class, is even more appealing than it would be otherwise.

42399744,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyblV,1492247311,Matchpool: The ICO 'Scandal' That Wasn't,"At the start of April, Matchpool, a new dating app that pays out cryptocurrency rewards to successful matchmakers, held a highly successful ICO.  In less than 48 hours, the company reached its target of 125,000 ether ($5.8m) and, after posting a celebratory thank you to their supporters, the team started to consider their next moves.  However, on April 5th, two days after the ICO concluded, warning bells were sounded.  A post on /r/Ethtrader and a tweet from cryptocurrency writer and former Coinbase staffer Nick Tomaino spelled out the concerns: the text of a post in the Matchpool Slack channel from co-founder Philip Saunders announcing his departure from the project and casting suspicion on the withdrawal of 37,500 ether ($1.7m) from the Matchpool ICO wallet by CEO Yonatan Ben Shimon.  Saunders wrote:    ""Yonatan keeps claiming he's working with Bitcoin Suisse and it's all okay, but so far I haven't seen any evidence of this. I suggest you all demand an explanation and keep a close watch. In all likelihood your guppies [Matchpool's currency token] are worthless.""    Redditors and Twitter users were quick to pick up on the thread, and the term 'exit scam' was thrown around, not just on forums but on cryptocurrency news sites.  Had the funds really disappeared? Was Ben Shimon more conman than CEO?  The short answer: no.  Currency hedge  Though it might come as a surprise to readers who heard of the story through social media, Matchpool had already announced plans to convert a proportion of the funds from ether into bitcoin prior to the supposed 'scandal' via the firm's Medium blog.  The rationale behind the conversion is that with ethereum's relative volatility – prices have fluctuated between $30 and $50 in the last month alone – could be mitigated with a conversion into the more stable bitcoin.  In a call with CoinDesk, the Matchpool team accepted that a greater effort could have been made to publicise the post at the time.  We also asked Ben Shimon to clarify the authorisation process for the movement of the funds – a contentious point since they were meant to be stored in a multisignature wallet as a guard against any single actor making the decision alone.  In fact, Ben Shimon held two signing keys to the wallet, requiring an additional signature from one of three other people in order to make the transfer. In this case, the third signature came from Stas Oskin, core developer of the Wings ethereum DAO platform.  Oskin confirmed that he had authorised the signature in an email to CoinDesk, adding:    ""[Hedging] seemed completely reasonable, in fact we advise a similar strategy to any project planning to launch on Wings.""    Moving on  Even if claims of financial mismanagement are unfounded, the dramatic exit of a co-founder is never something that reflects well on a company.  CoinDesk reached out to Philip Saunders for this article, but had not received a response by time of publication, meaning his perspective is absent from the narrative. Still, according to Matchpool's remaining team, he had not delivered on work that was expected from him ahead of the ICO.  In a blog post written after Saunders' exit, Ben Shimon accuses his co-founder of providing smart contract code that was rejected in an audit as having too many errors, and needed to be rewritten from scratch by Parity in order to be usable.  Parity did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment on the story, but until and unless more information comes to light, the onus is on Saunders to prove any further allegations of mismanagement on the part of the Matchpool team.  While any kind of scandal is damaging to a new company, and reputations can be difficult to repair once damaged, Matchpool now has the resources to move on into the build and prototyping phase. This process will be spearheaded by incoming CTO Or Demri, previously a software developer for the Israeli Air Force and a former consultant to various companies in the cryptocurrency space.  In his first public communication for the company, Demri laid out the development plan for an alpha launch of the product in Q3 of 2017 – an event that many investors will have their eyes on as a key indicator of the company's ability to deliver on its promises.  ""My mission is to give the community and all the contributors the best product, and deliver what Yonaton has promised – that's my target,"" Demri said.      CoinDesk also contacted Joe Shapira, founder of popular Jewish dating site JDate.com and a member of Matchpool's advisory board, who confirmed his active involvement and continued support for the project, adding:    ""I think that Matchpool will be a very beneficial venture for its founders and the investors in its currency.""        It's been a bumpy ride from the heights of the ICO to the allegations of a scam, but now the message from Matchpool is: we're here to stay.
