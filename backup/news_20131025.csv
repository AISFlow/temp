42425105,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwhh,1382719212,Silk Road's anonymity helped Feds bring it down,"It’s still mind-boggling to think that Silk Road, a supposedly anonymous black marketplace for illegal goods, could operate for such a long period of time without police interference.  New evidence has come to light, though, suggesting the Feds were actually involved in the operation for a long time before the website was taken down.  A recent document released by The Smoking Gun makes clear that Steven Lloyd Sadler - a top drug kingpin from Silk Road - was actively working with the Feds. The anonymity of Silk Road’s web presence actually made it easy for cops to make undercover drug deals and subsequent busts.  The sheer fact that Silk Road used government-supported institutions such as the US Postal Service to send black market items like illicit drugs to customers should be a red flag in anyone’s mind. One would have to consider that the seemingly enjoyable roller coaster of obtaining illegal items in relative anonymity would have to stop at some point.  But even with that in mind, many people still took the ride and it seems people are continuing to do so, despite the risks. But that doesn’t mean it will deter the overall growth of the bitcoin network.  Bitcoin’s bounce  There was a belief that the conclusion of Silk Road might result in a slow tapering off of bitcoin’s growth. But since the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, the alleged mastermind of the now shuttered online black market, the price of bitcoin saw a steady rise after a quick drop.  It’s bounced back up from a recent low of $99.81, the same day of the fed crackdown on Silk Road.  When is the last time we saw a $200 bitcoin price point? Back in April, when a huge run-up surrounding the restrictions around Cypriot banks caused a massive surge in speculative investing and media coverage of bitcoin.  Hopefully, this rise in price levels does not epilogue in a major crash, as previously the largest exchange, Mt. Gox, simply could not handle trading volume and halted operations for a period of time. Although, the price is no longer at the $200 mark it reached earlier in the week.  Regardless, the fact that the currency held its ground after the demise of Silk Road makes it clear that BTC does not depend on illicit goods to thrive.  The risky activity continues  Those who bought and sold drugs on Silk Road should realise that law enforcement does not take too kindly to boisterous criminal activity like sending narcotics through the mail.  Amazingly, there are still people who believe in the concept of selling illegal goods on anonymous sites and, for some reason, they continue to talk to the media. This was best exemplified when a large illegal goods broker going by the alias ‘Angelina’ made comments that no matter what drug enforcement agencies attempt to do, technology will still enable this type of criminal activity.  “It doesn’t matter who, or where or how exactly — as long as there are buyers there will be sellers,” Angelina recently told Mashable. And although these comments were before the demise of Silk Road, Angelina’s wares are still being offered on sites like Sheep Marketplace and Black Market Reloaded.  It’s fair to say that bitcoin has gained a bad reputation because there is a portion of the bitcoin economy that uses it to purchase illegal goods. But decentralized currencies don’t encourage people to buy drugs, they are bought because people want to purchase them, and they likely think that going online and using bitcoins is a better method of obtaining drugs than on the street, with cash.  This isn’t going to change, but bitcoin is not a reason to break the law, and this can undermine the good that it does represent.  It’s a tough balance: In the face of enormous positives, any news that paints bitcoin in a bad light will be highlighted, because that makes for a compelling storyline. At the same time, the fact that the price of bitcoin didn't crash post-Silk Road proves that it continues to be valuable, with numerous legitimate and innovative uses for it arriving on a consistent basis.  What do you think about the illegal use of bitcoin? Will it overwhelm the positives that it can bring to society?

42425102,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwfh,1382711411,"The downside of up, a miner problem, and robot overlords - ahoy!","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 25th October 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  The price of fame  There are many possible reasons why bitcoin's value has surged over the past week – China taking it seriously, the robust way it shrugged off the Silk Road shut-down, ever more bullish talking from venture capitalists and fund owners. (John Law covered most of those last week, so the real reason is probably investors hanging on his every word.)  Yet the price hike, whether it's just a spike or part of an unstoppable upward trend, is not particularly good news for bitcoin.  It is for those who have lots of bitcoins sitting around, of course; who doesn't like to see investments appreciate at breakneck speed?  But bitcoin's ultimate success cannot be as an investment vehicle. The world has infinite numbers of those: it doesn't have a serious independent way to move value across the Internet for ordinary people, which is where bitcoin's true potential lies.  There are two big drawbacks to a high price. The first is mostly an annoyance: nearly everyone selling goods or services via bitcoin also sells them in another, far more stable currency, and the bitcoin value of a transaction will be set at the time of the deal by converting the price in that currency to bitcoin.  Once the dosh is in the other chap's wallet, of course, they then have to deal with the volatility – you may only have one or two BTC in your spending wallet, but a vendor who's doing any appreciable business will soon accumulate a pile of the things which still have no particularly big market in goods or services that businesses themselves need.  Not a problem while the price is going up, but most businesses don't like having substantial holdings in a volatile commodity.  A bigger problem is the liquidity of the cryptocurrency. While you can easily spend tiny fractions of a bitcoin – 0.00005430 BTC is the limit, or around 1.1 cents at the moment, many people who want to sell bitcoin as bitcoin expect to deal in integers.  The number of normal people who want to drop $200 on an experiment – for that's what BTC is at the moment – is small. It feels a big number. It is a big number. It's a substantial barrier, perceived or actual, to mass participation.  This sort of problem is frequently encountered in equities, where a company's stock price builds and builds, hindering trades.  It's also the reason that most real-world currencies have a base value that's quite small: a dollar, a pound, a euro are basically just enough to buy a bar of chocolate. And while many currencies' base unit is much smaller than that – a yen is closer to a penny – there's not much that's more expensive than the pound sterling.  What happens when things get out of hand is a revaluation, or in the case of companies, a stock split. You have one $500 share; it gets exchanged for ten $50 shares – although this is less common in markets dominated by institutional investors, as today.  Currency revaluations have a lot more implications, but the principle is the same – if your base unit has become nearly worthless, you chop some zeros off the end or create a new one with a fixed (and very temporary) exchange rate to the old.  Bitcoin will have to do the same at some point if it is to fulfil its potential – a situation made more pressing by the very limited number of total BTC that can be created.  The alternative, and one that John Law suspects will be more likely, is that a new BTC-like cryptocurrency with a great deal more liquidity baked in will catch fire.  The most intriguing manifestation of this idea will be if the new system is publicly backed by a large organisation or group, whether that's trade, government or financial in nature. That could be a trading bloc, an ad-hoc coalition of mobile technology companies, even someone like Amazon – or its Chinese equivalent.  This could happen out of the blue, although it's more likely once BTC itself has got a longer track record, survived a few more fight-backs from the old order, and become more important.  Bitcoin may be a digital currency, but it for one could do with fewer zeros.  Monsters from the scrypt  Of course, there are already many other cryptocurrencies out there in contention for the 'better than bitcoin' crown. They all face substantial challenges: getting noticed, getting traded and getting mined.  The mining aspect is getting some attention. Too easy, and you get dramatic inflation. Too hard, and nobody gets to play: the idea of matching the amount of work to do to the number of miners worked well for bitcoin, ensuring that there was a large supply of cheap coins at the time things got serious, but preventing a sudden surge once the market was established.  You can only do that sort of soft start while nobody's looking, though: now, everyone's looking and the dangers of an immediate arms race are high.  That may already be happening with scrypt, an alternative proof-of-work algorithm used by altcoins such as litecoin, which is experimenting with the idea of having much larger numbers of coins potentially in circulation.  There are already companies in the ASIC/custom miner market, which means that you're not going to get much joy running software on your PC. You'll have to invest in hardware, and that's going to be a gamble if you're mining an un-established currency with little exchange potential and a sliding price.  There are also questions about power efficiency – spending tons of real-world currency on electricity when you could just buy BTC and have done is a hard course to justify – and whether the algorithm scales well with more powerful hardware.  What's needed, and what John law has not yet seen, is a decent way to model all these factors. That in itself is a complex task, as it would have to include population sizes, power pricing, the unneduate economic environment, the technical attributes of algorithms, chip creation and manufacturing costs and long-term market factors.  That is what modelling experts call one hell of an equation to optimise, and probably one that isn't amenable to cleverness. Brute force, and lots of it, will be needed to go through various combinations of all those variables.  The good news is that there are ways to do this. The bad news is that they're expensive.  This may be another pointer to the idea that the next big cryptocurrency will come from somewhere with a lot of resources – something which will also help sort out the other problems of getting known and getting exchanged.  It may be more sensible to skip the initial private mining and create a large pool of the cryptocurrency in secret and then distribute it, thus emulating bitcoin's own semi-stealth years.  After all, not that much of the world's gold comes from whiskery individuals up to their bony knees in mountain streams these days, even if they were first to the scene.  Bitcoin's role for our new robot overlords  Take a look at this short video with Richard Brown on Finextra. He's an executive architect – whatever that may be – for IBM in matters of finance and markets. He's also, John Law is pleased to note, one of the few people thinking ahead about cryptocurrencies, and is quite the fan to boot.  One of the ideas he floated in the interview was seeing bitcoin as a global asset tracking system.  A bitcoin may be worth so many hundred dollars in general, but there's nothing stopping a company saying that a particular bitcoin also represents something entirely different: the example he gave was it might be a hundred shares in a company.  Because any bitcoin can be followed through the system forever and can't be forged, that company could just say that 'whoever has this bitcoin on the day the dividend is paid, gets it', which would change the entire infrastructure of share ownership, and potentially uproot the stock markets altogether.  And it may be something that escapes the current universal fact about assets that they must be owned by someone or a corporation.  Brown brought up the idea that it may be a very good fit to the 'internet of things', the idea that all our stuff will be connected to the Internet and talk to each other.  [post-quote]  A classic – and easy to understand – case is smart meters, which can already report back on usage to a central billing agency, as well as find out when cheap rates are available and switch on heating, washing machines or other large loads.  But if the fridge and the washing machine and the central heating have their own stash of bitcoins, they can not only find out when the best source or time for electricity is, they can negotiate between themselves who gets the power when, for maximum efficiency, and swap money between themselves.  A vending machine, John Law supposes, wouldn't have to report back to its owners when its coin box is full or it has run out of Coke; it could directly order and pay for a refill from whichever warehouse is offering the best price, and pass on the profit directly to its owners – who'll end up having to do far less work.  You can't do that efficiently with card-based systems: it's a no-brainer with cryptocurrencies.  It is hard to see where this sort of thinking might end. With more and more of the daily financial underpinning of a technologically advanced industrial society taken out of the hands of people and handed over to the robots, the role of mere humans becomes increasingly unclear –something that may already be happening on the original Internet, with things like Google News replacing a whole raft of what newspapers used to do and Amazon nipping at the heels of retailers.  Dust off those Golden Age science fiction stories, people. Utopian leisure or dystopian wretchedness awaits.  John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude. He has returned to write for CoinDesk on the foibles of digital currency.

42425085,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwBh,1382700438,Old meets new: New Orleans antique shop accepts bitcoin,"An antique shop in New Orleans is welcoming the bitcoin community, trading precious vintage goods for the digital currency.  The store, which is called David's Antiques, Jewelry, Collectables Old & New is in the French Quarter of the city and is run by husband and wife team David and Ester Edry.  Ester said she first became interested in bitcoin a year ago having read an article about it.  ""I enjoy and appreciate the community it creates, connecting us to clients and friends around the world. Bitcoin is bringing everyone together, free from exchange rates and red tape,"" she said.  [post-quote]  Ester and David started accepting bitcoin in their store in early April, but said they wish they had done so earlier. ""As a high-end retailer, we found that bitcoin is really the ultimate way for us to accept payment – no high percentage charges, no additional equipment, no opportunity to lose bitcoin like you can with cash, and no such thing as a 'bad bitcoin'.""  Ester said she would prefer it if all her customers paid in bitcoin so her business can contribute to the bitcoin network rather than putting money in the pockets of credit card companies.  ""While we wish there were more everyday transactions, there is definitely a buzz building. We are in the heart of the French Quarter, and as such, we meet many amazing people from all over the world who come to inquire about and discuss bitcoin,"" she explained.  Instead of a traditional credit card sticker in the window of the store, the couple opted to promote the community with a large 'we accept bitcoin' sign on the door, which customers enjoy being photographed with.  The business' first bitcoin transaction was filmed by customer Paul Snow and his wife, who purchased some cufflinks and, rather ironically, a money clip.  Paul said the payment process was extremely easy and that Ester gave him an extremely favourable bitcoin rate.  ""The bitcoin world is just getting off the ground. No, you can't just walk into any store today and buy something with a bitcoin. But every day, more companies are coming online. And when you get to be a store's very first bitcoin customer? That is truly priceless,"" he said.  Ester hopes to start receiving more bitcoin transactions in the near future and said she'd love it if more businesses in the area started accepting digital currency.  Do you know of any businesses in your area that accept bitcoins? Let us know in the comments.

42425093,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHqwJh,1382675441,Bitcoin Core Development Update #5 brings better transaction fees and embedded data,"Bitcoin is about to get two significant updates: a way to embed information about ‘smart property’ into transactions, and a better way to calculate transaction fees. Bitcoin’s lead developer Gavin Andresen made the announcement yesterday in his fifth Core Development Update.  The latest update uses a new type of transaction to give people the chance to associate their own data with their bitcoin transactions, which is something that wasn’t explicitly allowed before. The team is doing this by enabling OP_RETURN, a transaction parameter that will let people embed a tiny 80 bytes of data into a blockchain transaction record directly.  80 bytes may be tiny, but it is enough to create a hash. Hashing is a way of producing a unique output that can be proven to represent a much larger piece of data, and it is one of the basic techniques in the bitcoin protocol’s toolbox.  Core developer Jeff Garzik says that this could be a good way to enable smart property in the bitcoin network. “The hash is a hash of an ownership token representing a car, or a house, or a stock or bond,” he says. “Using the blockchain, you may securely exchange these tokens for payment (bitcoins), or exchange them with another user, without involving a third party.” This sounds a lot like colored coins, doesn’t it?  There is clearly a demand for embedding data in transactions, because as Gavin Andresen says in the Core Update document, people already use all kinds of bizarre hacks to tie data to their bitcoin transactions.  For example, some may send money to a bitcoin address that isn’t complete or accurate, and which doesn’t actually exist, explains Mike Hearn, another of the core developers. By sending money to a malformed address, they force clients to register it in a part of a transaction known as an unspent output set (UTXO). The bitcoin network has to keep UTXO data immediately available to everyone, because it is an important item when checking that transactions are valid. It has no way of knowing when UTXO data is a malformed address, so it keeps it in fast, quickly-accessible storage.  Hearn said:  “OP_RETURN allows people to get data into the blockchain without it entering the UTXO set, which is a side-effect of the hacks a few people are using today.""  That’s a good thing, because the UTXO data set currently constitutes about 250MB, compared to the blockchain’s entire 10GB now, according to core developer Pieter Wuille. The UTXO set may only be a 40th of the blockchain’s size, but that’s still significant.  “Access to the blockchain doesn't need to be particularly fast or indexed – it just needs to be available,” he says. “The challenge is the database of unspent transaction outputs. It must be accessible in a fast way for any fully validating node, forever. So the more data that can be offloaded from the unspent transaction records to the rest of the blockchain, the better.”  Some (including Wuille) worry that people will use this new transaction type for storing messages or memos. This isn’t what it should be used for, but we have already seen people using bitcoin transactions where possible to send messages to others. Blockchain.info’s wallet has a special feature (non-standard to the bitcoin network) that allows people to attach messages to transactions being sent to blockchain.info bitcoin addresses. When the FBI nailed Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, it was used to taunt the FBI by sending tiny transactions with abusive messages.  There’s a chance that users could start trying to use OP_RETURN type to send messages and other data that it wasn’t intended to be used for. But given that people are doing it anyway, it’s best to try and limit the effect of it, Garzik says, calling it a ‘lesser of two evils’ approach.  The other big announcement was around smarter transaction fees. The network uses a set of heuristics that have evolved over the last four years to determine how much is charged (if the user opts to pay a transaction fee at all).  This means that the network can start doing strange things. “The current fees are hard coded,” said Hearn. “When the value of BTC/USD went up by 20x, so did the transaction fee, for no real good reason.”  Andresen calls it a ‘complicated mess’ and he has vowed to replace it with a better system. He is teaching the bitcoin wallet software how to estimate how low a fee a transaction needs, so that it can be accepted by miners when a transaction is sent. This will make it far more dynamic than the current method for charging fees.  Brian Armstrong, the co-founder and CEO of web-based wallet and bitcoin payment system Coinbase, liked the idea. Transactions between Coinbase users are all conducted off-chain, and fees are only applicable when payment is made from a Coinbase wallet to an external wallet. Coinbase pays those fees, which costs it 50 BTC each month, he said, adding:  “We're glad to see these changes since it means Coinbase's cost of paying miner fees won't continue to rise along with the price of bitcoin, but it instead will be subject to regular market forces that maintain a fair price over time.""  Stephen Pair, co-founder and CTO of payment processor BitPay, said that the current design of the bitcoin network hasn’t allowed for efficient fee discovery. “An efficient market for the work of transaction processing and security will eliminate the guesswork in applying a transaction fee. It will allow the parties of a transaction to determine fees that are appropriate for the nature of the transaction,” he said.  There were several other announcements in the Core Update, including a faster way to get the important information from a blockchain node when downloading the blockchain for the first time, and a way for bitcoin clients to function in no-wallet mode, making startup faster.  When will it be released? “When it’s ready,” said Andresen. It’s the testing which takes a long time, and they don’t want to cripple the network with a critical bug. If you can code well in C++, and you’re good at testing, they want you as a volunteer.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | ZRX,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/25/bitcoin-core-development-update-5-brings-better-transaction-fees-and-embedded-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70ed32ab607c1b702932750f7df87605eb82f920-1024x766.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
