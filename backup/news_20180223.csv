42428592,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9HRh,1519423203,Video Game Giant Ubisoft Is Exploring Blockchain Use Cases,"French video game publisher Ubisoft is exploring potential applications of blockchain in its Strategic Innovation Lab, which studies emerging technologies and their use cases.  Lidwine Sauer, the Lab's director of trends and insights, told the gaming news site IGN that Ubisoft is particularly interested in the blockchain's ability to offer unique ownership over digital items.  The technology presents the opportunity to ""finally have real digital collectables that cannot be replicated by anyone and can be 100 percent owned by you,"" she said.  As a result, Sauer explained, the blockchain also provides more protection over creative property:  ""Thanks to the blockchain, we can now have the equivalent of a digital Picasso, with the advantage that it's a lot more difficult to steal something on the blockchain than to steal a Picasso.""  One use case Ubisoft is particularly keen on is related to one-of-a-kind downloadable content (DLC), which is distributed by a game's publisher and typically includes add-ons such as aesthetic changes and new gameplay features.  However, Sauer said the Lab has ambitions for blockchain applications beyond DLC.  ""We want to go further than that,"" she said. ""We feel there's something even more interesting to find [through the blockchain], and we're in the process of trying to find that interesting thing.""  Ubisoft is not the first gaming developer to explore applications of blockchain technology.  CryptoKitties  , a game where users can buy, collect, ""breed"" and sell unique digital cats also puts to use blockchain's ability to facilitate unique digital content.  Likewise, the short-lived Crypto All Stars took a similar approach, allowing users to trade digital cards depicting major figures in technology like litecoin creator Charlie Lee and AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant.

42428586,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9HHh,1519419643,New York Lawmakers Open to Revisiting the BitLicense,"""Anyone in the crowd that does not think the BitLicense needs to be reformed?""  Not a word from the audience. Then, a few seconds later, laughter at the awkward silence.  But the question itself, posed by New York state senator Jesse Hamilton at a roundtable Friday, hinted that the controversial 2015 regulation may soon be revisited.  A bill to reform the regulation could be introduced ""very soon,"" State Senator David Carlucci told CoinDesk. ""That’s why we wanted to do this hearing, to get some views before we propose legislation.""  Speaking after the two-hour event, Carlucci said that a report will be prepared cataloguing the problems identified during the roundtable he hosted with Hamilton, as well as some of the solutions that were proposed.  Carlucci added:  ""We want to put that out there, circulate it and really figure out how we can make this license in New York state something that works for the residents of New York state and the state economy.""  And while the hearing didn't produce any guarantees of reform, both senators expressed an openness to continue the dialogue, with more events of this kind planned for the coming weeks.  ""We're going to do this again in a month, month and a half from now,"" Hamilton said.  But what is likely to remain is the animosity toward the BitLicense, as evidenced by the small but dedicated protest gathering outside just before the roundtable began, not to mention the grievances aired by the two dozen or so attendees.  Threatening to leave  ""Abolish the BitLicense!""  That was Theo Chino, who has waged a years-long campaign against the regulatory framework, at the outset of Friday's roundtable.  His sentiment – while perhaps not stated in the same terms – was nonetheless shared by the group of witnesses brought together to discuss the BitLicense, which was crafted by the New York State Department of Financial Services under former superintendent Benjamin Lawsky, and the subject of regulation of cryptocurrencies in the Empire State more broadly.  The department, which is now led by Lawsky's successor Maria Vullo, was not invited to participate in the meeting, a spokesperson for the regulator said by email.  Among those taking a negative tack toward the BitLicense during his testimony was Will Martino, one of the co-founders of distributed ledger startup Kadena. He suggested that because of the particulars of the BitLicense, his company faces challenges that might eventually drive it out of the state altogether.  ""We don't transmit or exchange real digital currencies for our customers,"" he remarked. ""Kadena is a tech startup company. We're not a financial institution. We don't do [anything with money]. Because of the BitLicense, we might leave New York.""  Indeed, the argument that the BitLicense is overly burdensome for small companies including those with limited access to capital and legal resources – that want to work with the tech.  ""For large [firms], the costs are coffee money, for a small business the costs are crazy,"" said software developer Steve B. ""The requirements are not practical.""  Lower the burdens, attendees say  Gilles Gade, chief executive of the New Jersey-based Cross River Bank, called for a kind of split between those working in the realm of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings and those working on broader applications.  ""We need to divide bitcoin and crypto, the ICOs, the tokens, from blockchain,"" he remarked. ""There's no reason the technologists need to be subject to overbearing licenses and that's what's hindering innovation."" That said, Gade conceded that ""eliminating the BitLicense is not an option.""  Kevin Batteh, chief policy advisor for the Chamber of Digital Commerce, commented that it makes sense for some types of businesses – namely exchanges – to fall under a framework like the BitLicense. But he echoed that a one-size-fits-all approach is hampering the work of other companies that, in his view, are being overburdened.  ""When you blanket it across the entire industry, that's where you have a problem,"" he said.  ""It's too early"" to write new rules for the space, Llew Claasen, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, argued at one point, later stating: ""The point is that current regulatory frameworks are sufficient to cover in specific use cases, rather than [the technology] having its own regulation.""  Next steps  That said, Friday's event highlighted the potential for some kind of common ground to be found – especially if such conversations continue between lawmakers and stakeholders working in the state.  Chino, commenting after the event, pointed to the need to ""define the terms before [states] regulate"" and called for community members to play a more active role in this process.""  ""It's happening at a state level in Tennessee and Nebraska and New York,"" he told CoinDesk, concluding:  ""Bitcoiners need to show up.""  Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.

The technology could hamper the second-largest U.S. bank's ability to comply with anti-money-laundering regulations, pose a competitive threat and force the company to spend more money to keep up with the times, the bank said in its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  ""Cryptocurrency"" is mentioned three times in the annual report, all in the section on risk factors.  The first reference is in the discussion of AML, know-your-customer, sanctions and foreign corruption laws in the U.S.  ""Emerging technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, could limit our ability to track the movement of funds,"" the filing says, explaining further:  ""Our ability to comply with these laws is dependent on our ability to improve detection and reporting capabilities and reduce variation in control processes and oversight accountability.""  Competitive threat  Yet perhaps more notable is the acknowledgement that cryptocurrency poses competitive risks to the bank.  In a passage about new competitors in the financial services industry, Bank of America expressed caution about how client preferences could lead them to use products like cryptocurrencies – for which, as it stands, the bank does not offer any support.  Bank of America notes in the filing:  ""Clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky, such as cryptocurrencies.""  Indeed, the mention of cryptocurrency as an outside risk is taken one step further, with Bank of America stating that rising adoption would result in it having to dedicate more resources – that is, spending money – to stay competitive.  ""[T]he widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services,"" the bank said.  Bank of America is one of several U.S. banks that recently banned credit card purchases of cryptocurrency. The bank did not restrict crypto purchases using debit cards, however.  Based in Charlotte, N.C., Bank of America is also a prolific filer of patent applications for blockchain technology concepts.

The government's central concern is curbing the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering, Bloomberg reports. Likewise, it wishes to extend oversight measures for traditional financial products to crypto assets.  ""Cryptocurrencies are significantly gaining importance in the fight against money laundering and terrorism financing,"" Finance Minister Hartwig Loeger was quoted as saying.

The finance minister's statements come on the heels of a report that the Austrian government is seeking suspects in an alleged bitcoin scam by a company called Optioment, which may have resulted in investor losses of up to $115 million.

42421894,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwp9Z,1519410604,Can the Bitcoin Network Scale?,"You have some bitcoins in your wallet and want to spend them on your daily purchases. What would that look like in a world where Visa, Mastercard and other financial services still dominate the market?  The ability of bitcoin to compete with other payment systems has long been debatable in the cryptocurrency community. When its mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto limited Bitcoin’s block size to 1 Megabyte (MB) in 2010 to prevent people from spamming the network, he also limited Bitcoin’s scalability.  Since each block takes an average of 10 minutes to process, only a small number of transactions can go through at a time. For a system many hoped could replace fiat payments, this presents a significant hurdle. An increase in demand would inevitably lead to an increase in fees, and bitcoin’s utility would be limited even further.  The scaling debate has unleashed a wave of technological innovation in the search for workarounds. While significant progress has occurred, a sustainable solution is still far from clear.  The Bitcoin block size debate  A simple solution initially appeared to be an increase in the block size. Yet that idea turned out to be not simple at all.  Increasing the block size could weaken the protocol’s decentralization by giving more power to miners with bigger blocks. Plus, the race for faster machines could eventually make bitcoin mining unprofitable. The number of nodes able to run a much heavier blockchain could also decrease, further centralizing a network that depends on decentralization.  Second, not everyone agrees on this method of change. How do you execute a system-wide upgrade when participation is decentralized? Should everyone have to update their bitcoin software? What if some miners, nodes and merchants don’t?  And finally, bitcoin is bitcoin, why mess with it? If someone didn’t like it, they were welcome to modify the open-source code and launch their own forked coin.  The arrival of SegWit  One of the earliest solutions to this issue was proposed by developer Pieter Wiulle in 2015, called Segregated Witness (SegWit.)  This process would increase the capacity of bitcoin blocks without changing their size limit by altering how the transaction data was stored. More specifically, SegWit involves removing signature data (the witness information) from the base transaction block (the main 1MB block) and adding it to a separate block, known as an “extended block.” This allows more transaction data to be added to the main block.  SegWit was deployed on the bitcoin blockchain in August 2017 via a soft fork to make it compatible with network contributors that did not upgrade. A soft fork is a change to the software protocol that makes previously valid transaction blocks invalid. While many wallets and other bitcoin services are gradually adjusting their software, others are reluctant to do so because of the perceived risk and cost.  Several industry players argued that SegWit didn’t go far enough. It might help in the short term, but sooner or later bitcoin would again be up against a limit to its growth.  In 2017, coinciding with CoinDesk’s Consensus conference in New York, a new approach was revealed: Segwit2X. This idea combined SegWit with an increase in the block size to 2MB, effectively multiplying the pre-SegWit transaction capacity by a factor of 8.  Far from solving the problem, the proposal created a further wave of discord. The manner of its unveiling (through a public announcement rather than an upgrade proposal) and its lack of replay protection (transactions could happen on both versions, potentially leading to double spending) rankled many. And the perceived redistribution of power away from developers towards miners and businesses threatened to cause a fundamental split in the community, despite being ultimately avoided.  Alternative bitcoin scaling solutions  Other technological approaches are being developed as a potential way to increase capacity.  Schnorr signatures: These offer a way to consolidate signature data, reducing the space it occupies within a bitcoin block (and enhancing privacy). Combined with SegWit, this could allow a much greater number of transactions, without changing the block size limit.  The Lightning Network: A second-layer protocol that runs on top of bitcoin. The Lightning Network opens up channels for fast microtransactions that only settle on the bitcoin network when the channel participants are ready.  Adoption of the upgrade is slowly spreading throughout the network, increasing transaction capacity and lowering fees. To date, more than 74% of bitcoin transactions use SegWit. Up from 44% last year.  Progress is accelerating on more advanced solutions such as Lightning, and the potential of Schnorr signatures is attracting increasing attention, with several developments working on detailing functionality and integration.  While bitcoin’s use as a payment mechanism has been superseded by its value as a speculative investment asset, the need for a greater number of transactions is still pressing as the fees charged by the miners for processing are now more expensive than fiat equivalents. Enhancing scalable functionality is crucial to unlocking the potential of the underlying blockchain technology as it continues gaining traction as a viable form of currency.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,"Eli Tan, Noelle Acheson, John Biggs, Hoa Nguyen",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/can-the-bitcoin-network-scale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07246b95bdd82d4e8dc2f4bd70069a731eeb4d26-1885x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42428595,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9HXh,1519408802,Ethereum Governance 'Not That Bad' Says Buterin Amid Fund Debate,"Ethereum's governance model isn't flawed, it's just badly communicated, the cryptocurrency's creator Vitalik Buterin said in a developer meeting Friday.  Coming amidst a heated debate over a proposal that seeks to standardize a method by which changes to the ethereum software would be considered as a way to retrieve lost funds, developers discussed how to clarify their process for accepting code changes and whether they should move to resolve perceived issues.  Since the proposal was submitted in January, hundreds of community members have come forward against the proposal – the core of which stems back to the decisions made during The DAO hack in 2016. One of coding team's veteran members even resigned from his post amidst concern about the process and the resulting backlash.  As such, Buterin's comments, made to the open-source project's top contributors, addressed what have been perceptions among users that ethereum's team of core developers hasn't been quick or authoritative enough in acting to resolve the dispute.  Buterin said:  ""I actually personally think that, in general, our governance mechanism as it is de-facto is really not that bad. Probably the main flaw is not so much what the mechanism is, as how we communicate it.""  According to Buterin, this is due to a lack of clarity on the process proposals such as the controversial EIP 867 undergo before they are merged with the platform's live code.  ""The impression that a lot of community members got from the outside is that [EIP 867] is a lot closer to being merged, than from being actually implemented, or actually finally accepted, that anyone involved in the decision-making process actually intended to signal that it is,"" Buterin continued.  Instead, EIP 867's status is as an unaccepted draft, a status it has remained at for three weeks, even though the bitter commentary on its thread has escalated.  Greg Colvin, who is leading an effort to improve ethereum governance, reflected on this, arguing that the developers could do more to make the early-stage nature of the proposal understood.  ""There really shouldn’t be a huge debate on whether we should assign this EIP a number and call it a draft. That's a technical, editorial question. It should not be so hard and so contentious,"" he said.  But since it has become combative, Alex van de Sande, a developer of ethereum's mist browser, suggested that another proposal, the Immutability Enforcement Proposal (IMP), which sprung up in response to EIP 867, should be merged as well.  This proposal provides a standard for rejecting fund recovery proposals, and according to van de Sande, could demonstrate to the community ""that you can have controversial standards, and one standard engaging the other, and both can be approved as a draft.""  Buterin took note of the idea, saying:  ""I agree that's definitely a clever way of undoing the signal.""

42428591,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9HPh,1519400731,Georgia Becomes Latest State to Consider Bitcoin for Tax Payments,"Two state senators in Georgia have proposed a bill that would allow citizens to pay their tax obligations in bitcoin, marking the second legislative effort of its kind to emerge this year.  Public records  show that the measure submitted on Feb. 21 by senators Michael Williams and Joshua McKoon would, if passed, tweak the rules governing the state's Department of Revenue, letting it accept both bitcoin and other as-yet-to-be-defined cryptocurrencies.  ""The commissioner shall accept as valid payment for taxes and license fees any cryptocurrency, including but not limited to bitcoin, that uses an electronic peer-to-peer system,"" the bill states.  The proposed law largely tracks with another bill that is currently moving through the Arizona legislature. That measure, filed in January, has thus far attracted support by lawmakers in the state, setting up the possibility that Arizona could become the first U.S. state to accept bitcoin for tax payments.  Like Arizona's bill, the one submitted in Georgia also mandates that tax officials convert those payments into U.S. dollars within a day of receiving them.  ""The commissioner shall convert payments made in cryptocurrency to United States dollars at the prevailing rate within 24 hours of his or her receipt of such a payment and shall credit the payor's account with such converted dollar amount,"" it explains.  Despite the encouraging signs out of Arizona, there's no guarantee that the measure in Georgia will succeed given past opposition to such proposals in other states.

Menendez further raised the issue during a hearing on Feb. 6 of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. During that hearing, neither Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Jay Clayton nor Commodity Future Trading Commission chairman J.

The figure hit a low of $422 billion Friday as bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell to an eight-day low of $9,593.  Meanwhile, the total market capitalization stands at $445 billion – still down 8.26 percent from last Friday's high of $485 billion. Further, the total value has dropped 14.32 percent from the weekly high of $519.42 billion (seen on Feb. 18).  Out of the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, the majority are reporting losses on a weekly basis. That said, small caps like nano, ethereum classic and vechain have managed to etch out gains.  Top performers  Nano  Weekly performance: +9.02 percent  All-time high: $34.40  Closing price on Feb. 16: $9.64  Current market price: $10.51  Rank as per market capitalization: 23  Nano (formerly known as raiblocks) is a bitcoin competitor claiming infinite scalability and no fees. The cryptocurrency clocked a 10-day high of 0.00010955 BTC today. Nano wallet for Android went live in beta this week, although it's unclear if the news has driven prices higher.  Ethereum classic  Weekly performance: +6.88 percent  All-time high: $47.70  Closing price on Feb. 16: $35.03  Current market price: $37.44  Rank as per market capitalization: 14  ETC, the native currency of the ethereum classic blockchain, rose to $42.85 on Bitfinex earlier this week – its highest level since Jan. 15. The cryptocurrency fell to $29.95 yesterday, amid a general market drop. However, the dip was short-lived, and ETC has appreciated by more than 10 percent in the last 24 hours.  An ethereum classic hard fork called ""callisto"" (CLO) is reportedly due next week and holders of ETC at the time of the fork will receive CLO coins at a ratio of 1:1.  Thus, the lure of making free money just by keeping the cryptocurrency in a blockchain wallet could keep it solidly bid in coming days.  Vechain  Weekly performance: +2.64 percent  All-time high: $9.45  Closing price on Feb. 16: $5.69  Current market price: $5.84  Rank as per market capitalization: 15  Vechain's VEN token is the third biggest gainer among the top 25 cryptocurrencies for the second week. It was also the best performing cryptocurrency in January.  A look at the VEN/BTC chart shows, the cryptocurrency is beginning to capitalize on the bull flag breakout witnessed on Feb. 15.  Bottom performers  Lisk  Weekly performance: -30.52 percent  All-time high: $39.30  Closing price on Feb. 16: $32.01  Current market price: $22.24  Rank as per market capitalization: 17  Lisk (LSK) topped out at $33.79 on Feb. 17, according to Bittrex, and fell sharply after the team behind the blockchain relaunched the project on Feb. 20.  The cryptocurrency had rallied sharply in the run-up to the relaunch date, and the losses may be merely part of the wider market dip.  Bittrex data shows the cryptocurrency is currently trapped between the 50-day moving average ($24.89) and the 100-day moving average ($18.96).  NEM  Weekly performance: -23.12 percent  All-time high: $2.09  Closing price on Feb. 16: $0.568887  Current market price: $0.437345  Rank as per market capitalization: 13  NEM's XEM token is trading below the 200-day moving average on Bittrex and ranks second on the list of losers among the top 25 cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency was also the second biggest loser last week.

42428590,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9HNh,1519392628,High Stakes: Ethereum's Fight Over Lost Funds Explained,"The ""world computer"" is ensnared again in a heated debate.  Sparked by a controversial code proposal called EIP 867, ethereum's development forums have become something of a battleground, crowded with bitter commentary, snide pull-requests and coordinated attempts to erase the idea from the platform's repository.  For those unfamiliar, the conflict surrounds an effort to make it easier for ethereum users to reclaim lost ether (ETH), the network's cryptocurrency (now valued at $870), outlining a process by which such requests could be submitted in a clear and executable format to those who maintain the technology.  No small problem, fund losses on ethereum have become frequent.  High-profile cases, such as the deletion of a code library from leading software company Parity Technologies saw 513,774.16 ETH or $421 million rendered inaccessible last year. And just months before, the same company lost 150,000 ether, or $123 million, due to a code error.  But it's not just Parity. Last year, a faulty ethereum address generator saw Kraken exchange and wallet provider MyEtherWallet lose hundreds of thousands of customer funds. And many more, whether due to glitchy software or simple typos, have lost money on platform — one address even holds a total of $6.3 million in ether because it too closely mirrors a call code that automatically locks up funds.  But while some users think refunding the lost ether is acceptable, a side effect of enabling digital fund ownership and the accountability that entails, others are vehemently opposed, believing that such efforts threaten the integrity of the ethereum platform, while raising potential legal liabilities.  Indeed, one core developer even stepped down from his role as code editor citing legal consequences that might ensue down the line.  Still, the conflict is nothing new, harkening back to a controversial decision enacted on the platform in 2016 — in which ethereum refunded 3.6 million in hacked ether in a system-wide upgrade, or hard fork.  Founder of ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, wrote on Twitter:  ""To those who thought that the DAO fork set an unbounded slippery slope and lasting precedent, I encourage you to see the reactions on this thread.""  In this way, the conflict emerging from EIP 867 shows the two sides of this debate have yet to reconcile, and that there's subtleties at work within each subset. Broadly, each side can be understood as having a differing interpretation of ethereum.  What is EIP 867 anyway?  In ethereum software development, an EIP, or ethereum improvement protocol, is the process by which code changes get accepted onto the platform.  To add new features to ethereum, software changes are executed in the form of platform-wide upgrades (sometimes called hard forks), but to get to this stage, proposals are subject to a rigorous acceptance process, consisting of roughly four steps:  First, if a developer has an idea for a software change, it should be presented as a pull request. As a pull request, changes can be easily made onto the proposal, and community feedback is welcomed. Here, it also falls under the scrutiny of the EIP editors.  If the EIP editors find the request to be technically correct and in tune with the ""ethereum philosophy,"" they can ""merge"" it as the draft into the next stage.  Once merged, software implementations, in the form of various ethereum clients such as Geth and Parity, can occur, and if they work, the proposal can be finally ""accepted.""  Once accepted, the platform can be updated with the EIP— providing the various nodes running ethereum software decide to upgrade.  However, in this process, EIP 867 is a little different. For one, it doesn't propose any software changes in itself, but simply documents a framework for proposals to follow.  In this, it falls into another category, called a ""meta EIP,"" which is a way to collect and formalize EIPs that fall within a certain category — in this case, recovery proposals. Because of this, the developers of EIP 867 have given the meta EIP a unique name: Standardizing Ethereum Recovery Proposals, or ERPs.  There have been a few proposals of this type.  Following the $421 million fund freeze last year, Parity Technologies drafted up several options to recover the funds – all of which were harshly rejected at the time. There is also an EIP named EIP 156, which, written by Buterin, details a method to return funds lost by Kraken and MyEtherWallet, as well as some other popular cases of lost funds.  According to EIP 867, the failure of such proposals is due in part to ""the relatively ad-hoc nature of such requests and the subjectivity that is often required to evaluate the merits."" As such, the EIP provides ""a standardized format for fund recovery EIPs and an objective standard by which to measure future proposals.""  Finally, if accepted, the class of EIP named ethereum recovery proposals (ERPs), would be subject to the same evaluation process of any code proposal on the platform.  Currently, EIP 867 is stuck in phase two of the EIP acceptance process — it is an unmerged draft. Former EIP editor Yoichi Hirai initially rejected the proposal on account of its failure to align with the ""ethereum philosophy""— one of the categories of judgement in the formal EIP process.  Hirai later stepped down from his position as EIP editor, citing legal concerns that may result from permitting the draft to continue.  And due to its divisive nature, ethereum developers have said that prior to any further action, the EIP process itself needs to be further reevaluated, to clarify whether things like subjective judgement can come in to play.  View 1: ""Code Is Law""  When ethereum upgraded to restore funds lost in The DAO hack of 3.6 million ether — now valued at over $3 billion — a portion of the community abandoned the platform to create a new cryptocurrency named ethereum classic.  On ethereum classic, which is now valued at just under $1 billion, the ethereum platform exists as if The DAO fund recovery of the 3.6 million ether never occurred, but instead, remain permanently lost on the platform.  Influencing this decision was the belief that ""code is law,"" which means that on a blockchain, all executions and transactions are final and immutable and cannot be overwritten or corrected, especially when regarding real money. In this perspective, code errors, like software faults that can be hacked or broken, are painful but necessary lessons for development.  Because EIP 867 could make such corrections more frequent, hundreds have stepped up to voice their opinions on Github — with some threatening to migrate to ethereum classic.  ""If you don't like the possibility of recovering funds use [ethereum classic]. This debate was settled two years ago,"" blockchain architect Cody Burns tweeted.  Because The DAO was largely led by ethereum developers with ties to the Ethereum Foundation, many saw the 3.6 million refund as a ""bailout,"" an allegation of developer corruption that persists in the EIP 867 debate.  ""If you want bailouts you should stick to fiat,"" leading voice on the opposition, Marius Kjærstad, wrote on the thread.  Arguing that such changes damage the incentive to maintain decentralized ledgers, software developer Charles Cooper wrote:  ""If this process exists then ethereum can no longer be called a blockchain, it is just a central bank which happens to use miners to validate the majority of transactions.""  Shadowing this, is the concern that EIP 867 would give developers too much power over the ethereum platform. Citing a Japanese law, Hirai argued that the movement of funds, especially in the case of unclear ownership, was beyond the capacity of developers and could make them liable to corruption, coercion and bribery.  ""I want to be a software developer, not a lawyer,"" Alexey Akhunov posted on the thread.  On the more moderate side, other voices on this side of the debate argue that The DAO was a one-off, and software-wide upgrades for fund recovery should be ""rare and increasingly exceptional"" as the platform matures — a position which Buterin himself has supported.  Toward this, developer of ethereum's Mist browser Alex Van de Sande has proposed a system whereby fund recovery could be possible without software upgrades, but instead by setting up an insurance pool for ether refunds.  View 2: ""Code is a process""  On the other side of the debate are some of ethereum's top developers, who argue that, in cases which fund ownership is clear and indisputable, recovery should occur.  ""It really seems to me that the case for recovering lost ether where it's easy to identify the true owner, and recovering it imposes a low burden on everyone else, ought to be fairly clear and uncontroversial,"" ethereum core developer, Nick Johnson, wrote on Twitter.  And such cases are relatively common.  In the examples cited in Buterin's EIP 156, funds lost in certain cases could be redeemed, and according to some, rightfully so.  Jesse Powell, the CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, wrote in response to EIP 156 two years ago:  ""Speaking on behalf of Kraken, I would characterize this more as recompense than rescue. We did take on some not insignificant losses as a result of the mentioned bug in the old ethereum javascript library. At the time, losses were covered out of Kraken's pocket to protect our clients.""  And Kraken isn't alone. Indeed, EIP 156 is littered with commentary from others who have been impacted in various ways, each appealing to the community for justice regarding funds lost at no fault of their own.  ""MyEtherWallet just burned me for 121 ETH,"" an infuriated user wrote on Reddit.  According to some, ethereum has a responsibility toward its users in these cases. Plus, by providing protection for lost funds, the risk of using the platform would minimize, leading to increased adoption.  And while community consensus is essential for changes to occur on the platform, concern has been expressed that the strong opposition to EIP 827 isn't representative of the wider set of ethereum stakeholders.  Speaking to CoinDesk, James Levy from Taptrust, one of the developers leading the proposal, said, ""One of the tricky things now there's a vocal minority, I don't take it for granted that the public response was totally representative.""  Levy added:  ""The large silent minority want the network to function, and the value of ether to grow. They don't have a dog in this race.""  Finally, because EIP 867 isn't a lost fund proposal in itself, but rather, a standard with which to formalize lost fund proposals, there's the argument that the current EIP in itself won't necessitate any controversial changes at all.  Instead, if accepted, ethereum recovery proposals (ERPs) would go through the same rigorous vetting process as standard EIPs. In the end, if a controversial proposal is implemented, users could choose not to update their software – thus falling out of sync with the dominant chain.

According to a document released on Feb. 23 by China's State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), the application was first submitted on Sept. 28 last year and invented by Zhao Shuxiang.  The application details that, instead of letting a new block store transactions from its previous one, a data compressing system could be used to pack transactions from multiple blocks into what the patent calls a ""data block.""  For instance, as the patent application describes, once the system receives a request to compress transactions from block 1 to 1,000, it causes a new data block to be formed and temporarily hosted on a different storage system. The system will then run the packed data through a hash function with a hash value.  Further, the compression system will give labels to identify blocks on the blockchain, newly formed data blocks and the compression event. The corresponding relationship among the three labels is also recorded on the blockchain.  Using this method, the patent claims a reduction in the amount of the data stored in new blocks as transactions mount in a blockchain, while ensuring that data from all previous transactions will still be tamper-proof and traceable.  While the patent is currently in the review process and is yet to be granted, it comes as part of a wider effort by the country's state-owned commercial bank in advancing its businesses through using distributed ledger technology.  As reported by CoinDesk last year, Bank of China has already partnered with China's internet giant Tencent to trial blockchain in financial applications.

CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) fell to $9,592.96 at 01:59 UTC – the lowest level for one week. As of writing, the BPI is seen a little higher at $10,090.  It is worth noting that the global average price calculated by CoinMarketCap is holding around $200 higher, largely due to the ""Kimchi premium"" – that is, BTC is changing hands above $11,000 on Korean exchanges Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone. Meanwhile, across western exchanges, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading closer to $10,000.  The cryptocurrency has depreciated by 1,86 percent in the last 24 hours, CoinMarketCap indicates.  So, it appears a relief rally has gathered pace, a move indicated by the bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence seen on the chart (prices as per Coinbase) below.  1-hour chart  BTC is stuck inside a falling channel, creating lower lows and lower highs. However, the RSI continues to diverge in favor of the bulls, so the corrective rally could be extended further towards $10,250 (falling channel resistance).  However, only a daily close (as per UTC) above $11,228 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the record highs), would signal a revival of the rally from Feb. 6 lows below $6,000.    Moreover, the odds are stacked against the bulls as, with the backdrop of the bearish ""gravestone"" doji reversal on the daily chart reported yesterday, BTC is more likely to extend the decline towards $8,800 (1-hour head and shoulders breakdown target as per the measured height method).    Additionally, as seen in the chart above, the 50-hour moving average (MA), 100-hour MA and 200-hour MA have topped out in favor of the bears. The chart also shows a bearish 50-hour MA and 200-hour MA crossover, as well as a bearish 50-hour MA and 100-hour MA crossover.  View  12-hour view: BTC could rise to $10,250 (falling channel resistance) and possibly to $10,300 (head-and-shoulders neckline resistance), courtesy of the bullish RSI divergence.  Longer-term gains appear unlikely, though, and BTC looks set to test $8,800 over the weekend.  A daily close above the 10-day moving average (currently seen at $10,378) would signal bearish invalidation.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) above $11,228 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the record highs) would signal a bullish reversal.

According to Japan's Nikkei Asia Reviewhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Policy-Politics/669-cryptocurrency-money-laundering-cases-suspected-in-April-December, the country's National Police Agency (NPA) released a report on Thursday indicating the cases were reported from April to December of that year.  As reported by CoinDesk, Japan passed a law in April of last year that recognizes bitcoin as legal payment method and requires cryptocurrency exchanges to be licensed. The obligatory reporting of transactions suspected to be part of money laundering and drug trafficking was also made part of the legislation in an effort to crack down on use of cryptocurrency as a medium to facilitate illegal financial activities.  While the NPA has not revealed the exact criteria used by exchanges to filter suspicious transactions, the data comes as part of a wider effort by Japan's regulators in probing cryptocurrency exchanges following the heist of over $500 million-worth of NEM tokens from Coincheck in late January.  Japan currently still has 16 cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coincheck, that are yet to be fully approved by the country's financial watchdog. Japan's Finance Ministry said last week that it has ordered the agency to conduct on-site inspection over these unlicensed platforms.

42428596,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9HZh,1519376402,Why Venezuela Should Worry About a National Crypto,"While not many things are clear about Venezuela's new state-backed cryptocurrency, the petro, what is apparent is that many think it's potentially harmful for the country's people.  Hard and fast details have been sparse about the crypto token launched by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Feb. 20. But, from its inception, the cryptocurrency was touted by the leader as a way to bypass financial sanctions (last month alone, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned four Venezuelan generals for corruption).  Amid those concerns about the oil-backed crypto, which supposedly raised $735 million on the first day of its pre-sale, many former and current government officials are uneasy about the thought of a potential Orwellian disaster that it might bring, too.  ""Cryptocurrencies combine convenience and freedom of cash with the potential of total control of all operations,"" according to Artem Duvanov, the director of Moscow Exchange Group's National Settlement Depository, which is experimenting with blockchain for a number of use cases.  ""If the government wants to introduce some control on operations done via crypto on its territory, it does make a lot of sense to issue its own cryptocurrency,"" he said.  These fears of a crypto-powered Big Brother are notable, since the original cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was heralded as a way for anyone to anonymously transact and sidestep government scrutiny.  But as the industry has matured, some blockchains – the permanent records of transactions that cryptocurrencies are built on – have started to conflict with that notion.  And what's so concerning to some about the petro's blockchain is that it's been instigated by one man, Maduro, and his party, who have a long history of corruption and human rights abuses, as well as a track record of stoking hyperinflation.  Yaya Fanusie, the director of analysis at the Center of Sanctions and Illicit Finance within Washington, D.C.-based think tank, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy (FDD), told CoinDesk that cryptocurrency in the hands of Maduro's regime should be worrisome.  ""With the Maduro regime’s record of corruption and abuses, this is something to be really concerned about,"" he said.  Fanusie, who is a former CIA analyst, went on:  ""Assuming people really do use the petro for daily transactions, it would give the government an acute awareness of citizens’ personal finances.""  Double-edged sword  The FDD is so concerned about the potential nefarious uses of cryptocurrency by nation states that a new joint research project has been launched within Fanusie's department to better understand how Maduro's petro could undermine democracy.  The new project, which is being conducted in partnership with the FDD's Latin America project and the Cyber-Enabled Economic Warfare project, is starting its work by using the same transparency that threatens Venezuelans.  While it's still unclear exactly which blockchain the petro is being built on top of – the petro's white paper states ethereum, but the buyer's manual claims NEM – both of those cryptocurrencies have public ledgers that FDD researchers can watch.  Specifically, the project will employ a combination of open-source blockchain explorers, data analysis tools and custom built tools to look for what Fanusie calls ""aggregate"" patterns in the flow of data.  ""What we're setting up is a way for when those coins start moving to see how many petro coins are being used,"" said Fanusie.  And with this research, Michaela Frai, a research associate for the Latin America project, who is now helping manage the petro-focused project, hopes the groups can glean insightful data that can be used to fight corruption in Venezuela.  She told CoinDesk:  ""My concern is that the petrol is going to continue to perpetuate this fake democracy, and only support the authoritarian dictatorship, and Big Brother the people around the country.""  Skipping sanctions  On the other hand, some actors are very keen on the prospect that Venezuela will be successful in circumventing sanctions with the petro.  Just a few blocks from the DFF, another think tank, the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), is paying close attention to Venezuela in that regard.  ""We are engaged in active research projects on these topics,"" said Edoardo Saravalle, a researcher for the CNAS Energy, Economics and Security Program, who co-authored a report last year on the use of bitcoin by terrorists.  Saravalle explained that his organization has been soliciting the knowledge of cryptocurrency experts and those in the know about how the technology could be used for nefarious activity.  While still in the earliest stages of that work, there's already a number of concerns he's identified. For instance, even if Venezuela's efforts to avoid sanctions end up failing, he believes other countries are watching, in an effort to learn how to adapt the model to succeed.  Already, a number of nations who have recently been issued sanctions have begun to explore state-backed cryptocurrencies. As recently as yesterday, a senior member of the Iranian government floated the same idea, following the People's Bank of China and the Russian deputy prime minister announcing similar endeavours.  Saravalle told CoinDesk:  ""If it doesn't work in Venezuela, someone in another country might make it work, and that is very disconcerting. It creates an incentive for countries to look around at cryptocurrencies in case they are ever sanctioned.""

In the end, Shock wrote that ""cryptocurrencies may be today's shiny, new opportunity but there are serious risks involved"" – and as a result, investors should tread lightly before putting their money into the market.

42428583,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9HBh,1519362021,Report: Mutual Funds Could Save Billions With Blockchain,"A new report argues that switching to a distributed, blockchain-based infrastructure could bring significant financial benefits to the asset management industry.  The release from Calastone, a transaction network for the mutual funds industry, predicts that such a move could slash costs for the global mutual funds market by over $2.5 billion a year.  According to an FT report, Calastone's deputy chief executive, Ken Tregidgo, said that using a distributed market infrastructure would avoid different companies having to input the same data, thus saving time and reducing errors.  For the research, Calastone used data from a 2016 Deloitte study and calculated the potential basis point (BPS) savings in key global markets including the UK, Ireland, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Australia.  Julien Hammerson, Calastone's CEO, said the results highlight the benefits of using blockchain to automate the full life-cycle of mutual fund transactions, from order placement through to the settlement and payment process.  Work in bringing mutual fund transactions onto a blockchain is already underway.

Though the technical specifics remain unclear, the lawmaker touts that Turkcoin would aim to tokenize asset-backed securities for the issuance, which he argued would yield lower risks than existing cryptocurrencies.  The report said such asset basket would include large public companies in the country's wealth fund such as Turkish Airlines, the Istanbul Stock Exchange and Turk Telekom.  He told Al-Monitor:  “The world is advancing toward a new digital system. Turkey should create its own digital system and currency before it’s too late.""

42401176,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLoe2,1519349416,Bitcoin Fees Are Down Big: Why It Happened And What It Means,"$26 down to $3.  The average cost of sending a bitcoin transaction is cheaper than it's been in a year and a half, showing the price isn't the cryptocurrency's only unpredictable metric these days.  But with all the debate about growing fees, this might come as a surprise. After all, it wasn’t so long ago that fees were so high a group of prominent investors and miners created a whole new version of bitcoin mostly to keep fees lower.  Backing up a bit, much of the conflict centered on the fact that while called “fees,” these expenses are best considered as transaction costs that are necessary to the network, as necessary as paying for someone to deliver a protocol service, be it SMS, VoIP or email, or even a pizza.  This is because bitcoin is a software that requires all of the many thousands of computers that run it to stay in sync. To do so easily, there’s a limit on how much data the network can process at intervals, and users need to pay more to get their transactions in at times of congestion.  So, as bitcoin grew more popular in the last year, fees skyrocketed to over $25, according to a graph from data website Bitinfocharts.  Bitcoin users, those who truly rely on the protocol for essentials, have been affected by this, as were those who believed bitcoin could be competitive with legacy payment systems.  But, bitcoin fees have fizzled out, declining since the end of December.  So, why did fees take a nosedive? The simple answer is users are making fewer transactions right now. In December, there were roughly 400,000 transactions per day, while today bitcoin is seeing only 200,000, according to data from Blockchain.info.  ""I think its really simple,"" BitGo CEO Mike Belshe told CoinDesk. ""There is substantially less transaction demand.""  The question, he added, is why has there been a decrease in transactions?  SegWit and beyond  If Twitter and Reddit are any indication, sentiment on the matter tends to be influenced by personal politics, in this case, where users stand in bitcoin's long-standing block size debate, which, at its core, was about network economics.  Popular Twitter figure “Armin van Bitcoin” cheered that the low fees mean the ""scaling debates are now a thing of the past,” pinning the development partly on growing adoption of Segregated Witness, a scaling feature at the center of bitcoin’s long-raging fee debate.  And there is truth to the claims. SegWit reduces transaction fees and adds more space to the blockchain, but it still isn't widely adopted, so it's hard to say how much it actually helped. There hasn't been much of a recent increase in SegWit use either. For the past several months, only about 10-14 percent of transactions, according to SegWit tracking site SegWit Party.  Plus, SegWit doesn't reduce the number of transactions, it makes each one cheaper.  Another possibility, according to Belshe, is that fee prices ""finally forced"" some large transaction processors to implement a technology called ""batching,"" rolling many transactions into one, to leave more space on the blockchain.  Indeed, exchanges like Coinbase have said they were working on implementing the feature in the past. And Thursday, cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift announced it now batches transactions, making a point that it makes up 2 percent of all the transfers that occur on the bitcoin blockchain.  However, it’s a theory that's difficult to get hard data on, unless an exchange were to formally announce that they were using this technique. ""This is hard to confirm with 100 percent certainty,"" Belshe said.  Still, he argued that even if just one large exchange started batching transactions, it could have a huge impact on the overall transaction load.  These sorts of technical theories add to the idea that developers and those building services on top of bitcoin can make optimizations in order to free up space on the blockchain, without compromising on some of its core features.  ""This is why Bitcoin Core worked so hard to get 'layer-two solutions' working, and why they focus so much on optimization of the size of transaction through various things like Schnorr and Bulletproofs,"" XO Media CEO John Carvalho said, adding:  ""They are doing everything to minimize the footprint of every type of transaction attached to bitcoin because they are all stored forever.""  Ditching bitcoin  Others, especially those critical of how bitcoin developers favor a smaller blockchain and limited transaction space, argue the lower fees are a consequence of people that are sick and tired of the high fees leaving bitcoin.  ""Bitcoin isn’t useful for anything that involves low fees so people are migrating to alternatives. this has the consequence of lowering the fees on bitcoin,"" said Ryan X. Charles, founder of Yours, a media startup building on bitcoin cash.  Charles notably moved his startup off of the bitcoin blockchain last year, migrating to alternatives before building on bitcoin cash.  It's possible that some users are doing the same. Payment processor Stripe stopped accepting bitcoin in January payments due to the high fees, and BitPay, a startup that offers payment services over bitcoin has differentiated into supporting multiple protocols for its merchants.  Yet, if they are pushing users elsewhere, it's not clear where they're going. Bitcoin cash, the cryptocurrency created as a cheaper alternative to bitcoin, still has about 10 percent the number of transactions bitcoin currently does.  ""Apparently [high fees] don't incentivize folks to switch to bcash,"" BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp said.  Bitcoin developer Meni Rosenfeld doesn't think so either. In fact, he disagrees with both of the above theories.  ""The main reason for the drop in [bitcoin transaction] fees is not SegWit adoption, and it's not people moving to [bitcoin cash]. It's simply that the craze for buying cryptocurrencies in general has calmed down,"" he tweeted.  Indeed, there's been a downtick in outside interest in bitcoin. A lower price has less new investors searching for bitcoin on Google and coming in to buy and trade the cryptocurrency.  This view seems supported by the fact that the second most valuable blockchain by market cap, ethereum, has also seen a dramatic drop in fees in recent months. The same goes for litecoin, clocking in at number five, and XRP, at third place.  Charles also argued it's possible crypto's waning hype cycle has contributed to lower fees.  ""I wouldn’t be surprised if ethereum is also lower due to the decline in market value,"" Charles said, adding:  ""There may simply be less demand for sending transactions across all blockchains. We went through a hype cycle.""  And it's always possible the low fees were caused by a mix of the factors described above.  Fees forever  What do lower fees mean for users? In short, it shows that under the current setup, fees might fluctuate over time.  The hope is that - eventually - fees will always be “low,” with the word low having somewhat of a relative definition. After all, a low-cost airline flight may be better than an expensive bus ride.  In this way, supporters hope that bitcoin will one day offer the best of both worlds, supporting high demand and ""low"" fees that reflect the quality of service, while also supporting miners, computer operators who devote real-world costs to securing transactions.  “The fee market is necessary as a counterweight to market price. [Theoretically,] demand for blockspace is infinite, so there must be levers to manage it,” Carvalho said.  In the meantime, fees could continue to decline, creating a new standard of “low” that might be friendlier to today’s internet users. Carvalho and Rosenfeld, for instance, think the much-touted Lightning Network will help get bitcoin to that point, as it moves more transactions off of the main bitcoin blockchain.  If Lightning really takes off, then low fees may become another problem, as they might not be enough to defray mining costs when the network finally produces all 21 million bitcoin.  For this reason, developer Greg Slepak had an almost ominous-sounding view of the future, arguing that users should ""take the opportunity"" of today's lows fees, adding:  ""It might not come again.""
