42383482,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w3K9,1585088736,Judge Halts Telegram Token Issuance in Injunction Requested by SEC,"A U.S. judge ordered messaging platform Telegram to refrain from issuing its gram cryptocurrency next month as planned, granting a request by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      In a preliminary injunction dated March 24, U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel, of the Southern District of New York, said the SEC had demonstrated a plausible case that Telegram had sold unregistered securities. The regulator sued Telegram in October 2019, alleging the company violated federal law when it raised nearly $2 billion in a 2018 token sale.      “The Court finds that the SEC has shown a substantial likelihood of success in proving that the contracts and understandings at issue, including the sale of 2.9 billion Grams to 175 purchasers in exchange for $1.7 billion, are part of a larger scheme to distribute those Grams into a secondary public market, which would be supported by Telegram’s ongoing efforts,” the judge wrote.      He pointed to the $1.7 billion proceeds from the sale in his 44-page opinion, writing that Telegram created a project to “maximize the amount initial purchasers would be willing to pay” for tokens by building a structure to maximize the purchasers’ profit upon resale.      See also: Russia Seeks to Block ‘Darknet’ Technologies, Including Telegram’s Blockchain      ""Considering the economic realities under the Howey test, the Court finds that, in the context of that scheme, the resale of Grams into the secondary public market would be an integral part of the sale of securities without a required registration statement,"" the judge wrote.      In his Howey analysis – the securities assessment named after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case – the judge wrote that purchasers would expect a profit, and while Telegram may have claimed it would not be the guiding force behind further development of the Telegram Open Network (TON) blockchain, “as a matter of fact,” it would be.      The judge did draw a distinction between the gram tokens when they eventually come into existence, and the securities Telegram’s customers allegedly bought during the initial coin offering in his ruling.      “The Court rejects Telegram’s characterization of the purported security in this case,” he wrote. “While helpful as a shorthand reference, the security in this case is not simply the Gram, which is little more than [an] alphanumeric cryptographic sequence.”      The judge previously told attorneys for both parties not to get hung up on labels during a February hearing over the case.

42383477,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w3Dr,1585086471,8 US States Follow DHS in Naming 'Blockchain Managers' as Essential Employees in Coronavirus Crisis,"A growing chorus of U.S. states have directed “blockchain managers” in food and agriculture to keep working through their states’ respective COVID-19 shutdowns.      The governors of Michigan, Massachusetts, Delaware, Ohio, Louisiana, California, Indiana and Washington state had all issued stay-at-home exemptions for blockchain managers by Tuesday afternoon, covering some 88 million residents currently or soon to be sheltering in place.      The orders by governors and their public health officials add legal heft to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) March 19 recommendation that blockchain managers be considered critical infrastructure. CISA is a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, and its memo, a fleshing out of U.S. President Donald Trump’s March 16 “Coronavirus Guidance for America,” was non-binding in nature.      “If you work in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the DHS, such as healthcare services and pharmaceutical and food supply, you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule,” the president’s directive read.      See also: Users See ‘Buying Opportunity’ in Coronavirus Market Downturn, Says Crypto.com      CISA followed up with an extensive nine-page list of “critical infrastructure industries” that included blockchain managers in food and agriculture.      “Employees and firms supporting food, feed and beverage distribution, including warehouse workers, vendor managed inventory controllers and blockchain managers” must not let the crisis stop their work, the memo advised.      Eight states have used that section verbatim or referenced its umbrella memo in their respective stay-at-home exemption actions, CoinDesk found.    What’s in a job?    What the memo did not specify is what a blockchain manager is or what these apparently critical workers actually do. Neither CISA nor any of the states that have taken action so far responded to requests for comment.      Allen Gulley, a research fellow at Auburn University's RFID Lab, said the CISA memo likely targets a small cadre of systems engineers working at the administrative level. They’re the ones “making sure that things aren’t going up in flames” across the supply chain.      He pointed to IBM Food Trust, one of the industry’s largest enterprise blockchain platforms and a partner of massive supermarket chains from Walmart to Albertsons, both of which track lettuce on its blockchain. They would need a blockchain manager, he said.      ""You need to have a blockchain manager behind the scenes making sure that everything's going according to plan,” Gulley said.      The Consumer Technology Association (CTA), a standards and trade group for the tech industry, believes that blockchain can play “a critical role in national manufacturing.” The group hailed the CISA memo in a tweet last week.      See also: The CFTC Just Defined What ‘Actual Delivery’ of Crypto Should Look Like      CTA’s state and local tech policy director Nathan Trail said blockchain managers keep everything moving.      “One thing that we forget with [internet of things], blockchain, algorithms and so forth is there's still a very human element that’s necessary in tracking and monitoring the systems to ensure they’re maintained as they should be,” he said.    Experimental tech – for now    Gulley has worked at the forefront of manufacturing and supply chain blockchain systems, most recently in an RFID Lab trial for Nike. He says the tech is still too new to have much of a presence across major supply chains – food, manufacturing, pharma or otherwise.      “There are some production grade networks out there where companies are really running their operations on some sort of blockchain platform,” Gulley said. “But there’s far more people that are just playing with it right now.”      Stay-at-home orders are therefore unlikely to kneecap that handful of companies, he said. Plus, their blockchain managers can easily do the job from home.      Even so, Gulley said CISA’s recommendation and the states' subsequent orders could validate a profession still in its infancy. There’s a certain pride that comes with being labeled “critical infrastructure,” and he said players in the industry are taking note.      “I think that’s why people have been excited about it,” he said. “It's crisis time and people are recognizing that there’s a blockchain role critical to keep everything functioning.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/24/8-us-states-follow-dhs-in-naming-blockchain-managers-as-essential-employees-in-coronavirus-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4793ed9b8822abfbb9cfd573b7cd056d1e7a6ec-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383491,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w3UD,1585082334,"Stocks, Bitcoin Rally on Prospects for US Senate Stimulus Bill","Financial markets rebounded Tuesday after prospects for a stimulus package out of the U.S. Senate improved.      The upswing started with Japan’s Nikkei 225, which closed its trading day at 5:00 UTC up 7 percent. European stocks were bullish as well, with the FTSE 100 index gaining over 8 percent.      As for U.S. markets, the S&P 500 index rallied 9 percent. It’s a respite from Monday when the American markets officially wiped away all gains since 2016. The Federal Reserve’s announced easy money policy of using lower rates and quantitative easing (QE) to boost the coronavirus-plagued economy wasn’t able to staunch the bleeding in the equity markets.      However, judging by the way U.S. markets closed, the promise of fiscal stimulus from the Senate — once agreement is reached between Republicans and Democrats — is helping the market stop the bleeding more than the Fed's monetary policy.      Bullishness extended to large parts of the crypto markets. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 6 percent as of 20:00 UTC. Notable gainers in crypto over the past 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC include monero (XMR), up 10 percent; NEO (NEO), in the green 6 percent; and bitcoin cash (BCH), up 4 percent.      “As central banks take on more risk with unlimited QE, the 'credibility risk' rises accordingly. This credibility risk is positive for alternative currencies such as bitcoin and gold,” said Denis Vinokourov of London-based digital asset firm Bequant.      Indeed, gold is also up today, with the yellow metal shining in the green, with gains of 4 percent as of 20:00 UTC.      Cryptocurrency traders have been pointing to retail purchasers, those casual buyers of crypto, to help digital assets continue recovery from a bloodbath that occurred March 12. That’s when bitcoin prices plunged as low as $3,850 on exchanges including Coinbase.      “We’re seeing a ton more retail buying at these levels, which is great,” said Ryan Salame, head of over-the-counter trading for Alameda Research.      “Over-the-counter demand in both gold and bitcoin is strong. However, deals are harder to do with travel restrictions and all,” noted Sweden-based crypto trader Henrik Kugelberg.      As BTC traded in a $6,400-$6,800 range Tuesday, a fundamental event for crypto approaches regardless of coronavirus-related lockdowns. The bitcoin halving, expected in mid-May, will reduce miner reward. In the two previous times this has occurred — 2012 and 2016 — bitcoin prices eventually went up.      However, it’s important to note that while prices did dramatically rise after previous halving events, it took some time to happen.      The upcoming halving means reward in new bitcoin generated will be slashed to 6.25 BTC from 12.5 BTC for miners. Some suggest bitcoin’s prices will continue to rise as more retail investors become informed of when and how the halving happens.      “This action is expected to remain intact, especially as the market heads into the block reward halving event,” noted Bequant’s Vinokourov.",POSITIVE,BCH,BCH | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/24/stocks-bitcoin-rally-on-prospects-for-us-senate-stimulus-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0becf8d16fc777ab864226238d8bad5c502295f8-1274x799.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Early Friday morning, the bank was unable to process wire transfers for clients because of an outage at bank payments processor Finastra. Silvergate, like many community banks, uses Finastra’s cloud data centers as opposed to hosting those centers on the bank’s premises. When Finastra detected anomalies in its systems as a potential cyberattack, the service provider shut down its system, cutting off wire transfers for Silvergate’s customers.      According to Lane, the La Jolla, Calif.-based Silvergate was one of the first banks on Finastra’s network that became fully operational. Finastra did not respond to request for comment. The bank is one of the few banks in the U.S. totally focused on the cryptocurrency industry, with 804 clients in the digital currency space.      The Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) was uninterrupted and customers that had funds already on the platform were able to trade, Lane said.      By Thursday, the bank was already 90 percent remote, but the wire desk and technology support team were in the office when the outage occurred. (Bankers are still considered essential workers under California’s statewide shelter-in-place order. Nearly all of Silvergate’s staff is now working from home.)      Any of the large crypto exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks that had integrated with Silvergate through an application programming interface (API) came online early yesterday morning.      “We have been working on updating our SEN portal so that ultimately at some point this year all of our customers will be able to access the API version through a portal without having to go through online banking,” Lane said.      The outage on Friday had some worried about how Silvergate was faring after the market downturn.      Despite a crash in both equities and bitcoin, Silvergate remains well capitalized. At the end of 2019, its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 11.4 percent, double the 5 percent ratio that regulators require, according to its fourth-quarter earnings report. The bank’s total risk-based capital ratio is 26.5 percent compared to the 10 percent required.      “Silvergate is very strong, liquid and well capitalized,” Lane said. “The issue we experienced was with a third-party service provider who worked with us around the clock, and everything is working again and we’re open for business.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/24/silvergate-bank-resolves-wire-transfer-issue-that-kept-transactions-in-limbo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed481aed61cabec751eb80eaf6ab0d1ffdca7a5b-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383478,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w3F7,1585078896,The CFTC Just Defined What 'Actual Delivery' of Crypto Should Look Like,"The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) published its final guidance on ""actual delivery for digital assets"" Tuesday, seemingly settling a longstanding question on when a cryptocurrency can be ""delivered"" from one party to another.      The CFTC shared a 35-page document stating that in its view, ""actual delivery"" occurs when a customer has complete control over the asset and the offeror no longer has any control over the asset by the end of 28 days after the transaction. The publication comes following several years of public input from exchanges and other stakeholders.      The regulator approved the draft on March 23, according to the document.      How ""actual delivery"" is defined has long been an open question. In 2016, law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP petitioned the CFTC after the federal commodities regulator settled charges with crypto exchange Bitfinex on trading violation allegations.      The charges stemmed from CFTC allegations that Bitfinex maintained control over cryptocurrency private keys after delivering funds tied to margin trading, and therefore the funds weren't actually delivered. The charges were settled, with Bitfinex paying $75,000.      Steptoe filed a petition shortly after, claiming the settlement did not provide any clarity to what ""actual delivery"" looked like. The petition argued that the definition of custody was unclear, which could be harmful to the crypto industry.      Tuesday's filing might settle some of this gray area.      ""However, the Commission notes that it does not intend to create a bright line definition given the evolving nature of the commodity and, in some instances, its underlying public distributed ledger technology,"" today's document said.      CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert said in a statement he does not believe the agency will conduct enforcement actions for the next 90 days around potential delivery violations to ""prevent any potential market disruptions"" as firms abide by the new guidance.      According to Tuesday's document, the CFTC defines ""actual delivery"" as having occurred when:    ""(1) A customer secures: (i) possession and control of the entire quantity of the commodity, whether it was purchased on margin, or using leverage, or any other financing arrangement, and (ii) the ability to use the entire quantity of the commodity freely in commerce (away from any particular execution venue) no later than 28 days from the date of the transaction and at all times thereafter; and (2) The offeror and counterparty seller (including any of their respective affiliates or other persons acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty seller on a similar basis) do not retain any interest in, legal right, or control over any of the commodity purchased on margin, leverage, or other financing arrangement at the expiration of 28 days from the date of the transaction.""

42383493,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w3Wj,1585077079,BitMEX Open Interest Collapses After Controversial Long Squeeze,"While bitcoin’s (BTC) price is rallying, traders have scaled back their open interest positions in bitcoin perpetual contracts listed on the crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX.       The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to $6,863 early Tuesday, representing a 77 percent gain on the recent low of $3,867 registered on March 12, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.       Meanwhile, open interest, or outstanding positions, in XBT/USD (bitcoin) perpetual contracts fell to 55,000 BTC. That’s the lowest figure in at least 18 months, which is when crypto derivatives research firm Skew began tracking BitMEX’s data.      A perpetual contract resembles a futures contract as it offers high leverage and is a margin-based product. However, there is no expiry or settlement and thus it trades close to the underlying reference index price. The exchange uses the term ""open value"" for open interest in its perpetual contracts when measured in bitcoin terms.      Open interest in XBT/USD on BitMEX has crashed by over 50 percent from 115,000 BTC to 55,000 BTC over the past 12 days.       Activity has cooled significantly following bitcoin’s sudden drop from around $7,300 to $3,867 during a 16-hour period from 10: 00 UTC on March 12 to 02:00 UTC on March 13.      “Markets in general – both traditional and cryptocurrency – have seen volumes hit as traders figure their way through the uncharted waters of recent weeks. Open interest on the BitMEX XBTUSD market, which remains the most liquid globally, has been impacted in line with what we have seen across the entire market,"" Greg Dwyer, head of business development at BitMEX told CoinDesk.       “Open interest is falling because the market is full of uncertainty,” Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, told CoinDesk. “Traders in all fields, whether traditional or crypto, are simply unsure of where the market is going. Therefore they are being cautious and want to sit on the sideline to observe the market, until a clear entry signal appears.""      See also: Bitcoin’s Approaching ‘Halving,’ Explained      While the market sentiment was bearish to begin with, the downside move was exaggerated by forced liquidations of long positions on BitMEX.       The “long squeeze” reportedly occurred between 02:16 and 02:40 UTC on March 13, when the exchange was down for maintenance. During that time, bitcoin’s price volatility spiked with prices dropping to $3,867 for just five minutes before quickly recovering above $4,000.     Open interest is falling because the market is full of uncertainty.    As a result, some in the crypto community suggested possible price manipulation on BitMEX. Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of Alameda Research and BitMEX’s rival exchange FTX, published multiple tweets, wondering out loud if there really were hardware issues, and saying the exchange’s unwillingness to address the market situation promoted the price slide.       BitMEX dismissed Bankman-Fried’s argument as a conspiracy theory. However, the controversy seems to have led to a slowdown in the activity, as represented by the drop in open interest.       While open interest has declined from $1.2 billion to $500 million on BitMEX since the big long squeeze, it has skyrocketed for their rivals. On FTX, open interest has increased from $68 million to $128 million in the past 12 days. Similarly, for Bybit it has risen from $35 million on March 14 to $100 million on March 22.    Global slowdown    Nonetheless, overall activity has slowed significantly across the globe over the past five weeks.      “Markets in general – both traditional and cryptocurrency – have seen volumes hit as traders figure their way through the uncharted waters of recent weeks. Open interest on the BitMEX XBTUSD market, which remains the most liquid globally, has been impacted in line with what we have seen across the entire market.,”      Aggregate open interest has declined by 50 percent from highs witnessed in mid-February, Skew’s CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk.      Global open interest had risen above $5 billion in mid-February when bitcoin’s price was trading near $10,500. At press time, total open positions were around $1.6 billion.     Spot-driven rally    Given the decline in the institutional activity, bitcoin's recent recovery rally looks to have been driven by the spot market, which is mainly dominated by long-term holders and retail traders.

42383483,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w3LP,1585071024,The Pandemic Gives Digital Currencies Another Chance to Shine,"Marcelo M. Prates is a lawyer at the Central Bank of Brazil and holds a doctorate from Duke University School of Law. The views expressed here are his own and do not reflect the position or policy of any of the institutions with which he is affiliated.      In times of crisis and radical uncertainty, the search for alternatives that can improve everyday life intensifies. The Bitcoin project was launched in October 2008, just six weeks after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and the financial crisis went from bad to dreadful. Since then, many other private cryptocurrencies have sprung up, and even central banks have began contemplating digital currencies of their own. None of these digital currencies became widely available or adopted, though.      The coronavirus pandemic and its severe social, political and economic repercussions give digital currencies one more chance to shine. Unlike cash, digital currencies would not be a potential source of virus transmission or require persons to overlook social distancing when making payments. A central-bank digital currency (CBDC) available to the public could, moreover, allow the government to send money directly to the population as part of a stimulus plan without having to mail checks.      But can digital currencies, private or public, finally deliver on their promises and change money for the better? It does not seem so.      First, cryptocurrencies are an elitist type of money. Bitcoin (BTC), the reigning cryptocurrency until these days, may be attractive to the tech savvy and wealthy, but fails to meet the needs of people fighting for survival. As bitcoin enthusiast Peter McCormack reports from a recent visit to Venezuela, the persons who could benefit the most from bitcoin cannot use it. The poor and the less educated, who rely on cash and are the most affected by surging inflation, don’t have regular access to smartphones, connectivity or even electricity.      See also: 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital Currencies      Here lies a lesson for central banks. If they plan to issue a digital currency that can be used by banks and the public alike, they’ll need to adopt an all-or-nothing approach. Either everyone – no matter how poor, uneducated or old they may be – will have full access to the CBDC or it isn’t ready for launch.      Instability is the second reason why cryptocurrencies still fall short of revolutionizing money. Even if people from a country facing monetary disarray could flight for bitcoin to seek protection against hyperinflation, they would continue to face price instability. During the coronavirus outbreaks, bitcoin lost half its value in dollars in a matter of weeks – not what is expected from “digital gold.” As usual, liquidity and safety were only found in U.S. bonds and dollars.      So, the issuer or the people behind the currency still matter. Facing doomsday scenarios, both sophisticated investors in Tokyo and regular people in Harare trust the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve above all. Does that mean governments are more reliable than private money issuers? Not necessarily.    Bank deposits are the closest we have to a digital sovereign currency – and they’re privately issued.    As Argentinians and Brazilians can tell, some governments will not think twice before freezing bank accounts and limiting withdrawals during a crisis. Imagine what they could do with a CBDC! More than that, about nine in 10 dollars in circulation are already created by private parties: commercial banks. Bank deposits are the closest we have to a digital sovereign currency – and they’re privately issued.      To be sure, as Cornell law professors Robert Hockett and Saule Omarova well underscore, the modern financial system is a public-private partnership, in which a sovereign government takes a privately issued liability (bank deposits) as a liability of its own (money). This franchise-like arrangement also means that, when things go wrong, the sovereign government has to provide support in the form of liquidity assistance and bailouts. After all, it’s “the sovereign’s full faith and credit” that are at stake.      A privately issued digital currency could only present a credible alternative to this public-private model now in place if it could avoid bitcoin’s shortcomings. Global technology companies, like Google or Facebook, are the most favorably positioned to come up with an option in the short run. They can take advantage of their extensive user base and geographical dispersion to quickly provide the public with a digital currency that would facilitate not only local transactions but also cross-border payments.      See also: The US Should Use Stablecoins for Emergency Coronavirus Payments      Facebook’s libra was the initial step in this direction. However, as I argue in another post, libra looks more like a security than a currency and may well be a short-lived project because of its flawed design. To avoid this fate, the Libra Association should shy away from the stablecoin model, which requires the digital currency to be backed by a basket of sovereign currencies. This feature may be useful to help the digital currency keep its value stable. But it also turns the currency into a digital claim on a portfolio of assets, much like shares in a money-market fund.      If the Libra Association wants to create a truly digital currency, it should move libra closer to the bitcoin model. Libra could still have an identified issuer, but it should also have its own unit of account and not rely on sovereign currencies to be created, transferred, or valued. In this case, libra could deliver the benefits of both the public and private monies without the hassles.      Because of Facebook’s 2.4 billion user base, a revamped libra would be readily available to more than 1/3 of the world’s population. Rich or poor, old or young, educated or illiterate, if these users can already access Facebook, they could easily use libra, too. Also, with a known and reliable issuer behind it, libra could gain the public’s confidence – as long as the Libra Association can overcome Facebook’s complicated history with privacy protection. And the more trustworthy the issuer, the more stable and safe the currency.      Against this backdrop, Facebook seems to be the only institution ready to launch an alternative currency in the digital format that could be widely available and potentially stable. In any case, finding the money of choice eventually comes down to answering one salient yet old question: Who do you trust the most (or the least) to take care of your money? Your government, bitcoin’s developers and miners or Facebook?      For comments, please contact marcelo.prates@bcb.gov.br",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Marcelo M.

The bill echoes language from a pair of draft U.S. House bills aimed at stimulating the economy during the coronavirus outbreak.      The bill, introduced by Ranking Member Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), is not proposing a crypto dollar but a digitized version of the existing dollar, a process advocates including former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Chris Giancarlo have called for to maintain U.S. financial hegemony.      According to the draft, the digital dollar will be “dollar balances consisting of digital ledger entries recorded as liabilities in the accounts of any Federal Reserve bank.”      The bill even notes that such wallets should be branded as “FedAccounts.”      Like a pair of draft bills in the U.S. House of Representatives, the proposed digital dollar would be operated and maintained by the Federal Reserve (the U.S. central bank). The Fed would be responsible for maintaining the digital wallets to support the funds, on behalf of individuals.

States might also designate some non-member banks to offer these wallets.      The House draft bills mentioned a digital dollar as one potential method for distributing relief funds to U.S. residents during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

42383487,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w3Rh,1585063207,"Russian Prime Minister Introduces Bill to Allow Fintech Sandboxes, Blockchain Included","The Russian government may soon allow the creation of regulatory sandboxes for companies working on cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and distributed ledgers.      Introduced in a new bill on March 17 by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, the plan does not directly mention blockchain or cryptocurrencies, but an explanatory note mentions distributed ledger as one of the technologies that could be explored in the new “experimental regulatory regimes.”      Such regimes can be established to live-test the new technologies in medicine, transporation, distant learning, financial markets, online commerce and other sectors. The bill gives Russia’s regulators scope to deal with novel tech in a more flexible way, the document says. It’s also suggested that the country’s regions would be able to set up their own local sandboxes.      The Bank of Russia, the central bank, will be supervising the sandboxes related to fintech. Representatives of the Economic Development Ministry, which initiated the bill, told the Russian newspaper Izvestia that fintech projects operating within sandboxes would be subject to lighter regulation regarding cash reserves, financial reporting and foreign currency controls.    Real cases, real clients    Olga Shepeleva, a senior expert at the Center for Strategic Research, a Moscow-based think tank that helped draft the bill, told CoinDesk the law should have already been passed as a part of the government’s program on developing the digital economy in Russia. However, there were concerns that such a law would excessively skew the power balance in favor of the executive branch.      “The main idea is that the government can choose to make a temporary exceptions from laws and regulations” for the sandboxes, Shepeleva said.      The Bank of Russia has already been running a regulatory sandbox for fintech projects, and has even reported successfully testing a blockchain-based tokenization pilot by the mining and smelting company Nornickel.      However, the central bank’s sandbox only helps to model the possible uses of the new technologies, but does not allow businesses to test their use cases on real clients; neither does it provide the means for expert and public control over such experiments. The new bill will allow the creation of sandboxes in which real businesses will be working with real customers, Shepeleva explained.    No crypto    Russia’s central bank has consistently maintained a skeptical stance towards cryptocurrencies and has recently said it's involved in drafting legislation that will block crypto marketplaces from operating in the country, though ownership would likely be tolerated.      Mikhail Komin, research director at the Center for Advanced Governance in Moscow, said Russia is unlikely to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies anytime soon, saying: “For sure, the [coronavirus] pandemic and the financial crisis makes the government look for unorthodox solutions, but crypto is not a part of that.”.      “The Bank of Russia is interested in lowering uncertainty in the financial and foreign currency markets caused by the volatility of the Russian ruble, and it believes cryptocurrencies would add even more uncertainty,” Komin said.

42383489,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w3QR,1585059325,'Digital Dollar' Stripped From Latest US Coronavirus Relief Bill,"Mentions of a ""digital dollar"" in a coronavirus-related relief bill before the U.S. House of Representatives – one of the two chambers of Congress – have been scrubbed.      House Democrats' latest version of the ""Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act,"" revealed late Monday, does not contain any language around a ""digital dollar"" in its section on direct stimulus payments.      The lawmakers introduced the bill last week, envisioning a digital payment system organized by the Federal Reserve and its member banks to directly send these funds to U.S. residents to assist them with expenses during the COVID-19 mitigation measures, which have already resulted in massive unemployment and a potentially severe recession.      In the latest 1,404-page draft, U.S. residents would receive $1,500 per person, though individuals with an income greater than $75,000 and couples with an income greater than $150,000 would have to repay the funds.      The section detailing the payments, which starts on page 1,090, appears to be less specific on how these payments would be sent to individuals than previous versions have been.      While the draft bill introduced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Monday no longer includes any language around a digital dollar, a separate bill introduced by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), titled the ""Financial Protections and Assistance for America’s Consumers, States, Businesses, and Vulnerable Populations Act,"" still mentions the digital dollar.

In emergency motions for release to the U.S. District Court covering New Jersey, Matthew Goettsche and Jobadiah Weeks argue they should be temporarily released from an Essex County (N.J) Correctional Facility as the chances of contracting coronavirus are higher in an enclosed jail environment.      ""While the harsh realities of COVID-19 affect the world at large, the risks presented by the virus are particularly acute for inmates. Conditions of pretrial confinement have proven time and time again to create the ideal environment for the transmission of contagious disease,"" Goettsche says in a letter to the federal court.      See also: The US Should Use Stablecoins for Emergency Coronavirus Payments      Goettsche and Weeks founded the BitClub Network, a bitcoin mining pool that claimed to have multiple mining operations, in 2014. U.S. authorities accused them of falsifying earnings figures to defraud investors out of a total of $722 million and formally charged them with committing wire fraud and conspiracy to offer unregistered securities in December.      In their submissions this month, Goettsche and Weeks argue they are unable to follow medical advice in jail because hand sanitizer is a controlled substance, and inmates are frequently in close proximity to one another. Weeks added that Essex County already has an ""exceptionally poor record of maintaining detainee health"" and that its measures to prevent a coronavirus outbreak did little to protect the health of inmates.      Confinement in these circumstances will place greater restrictions on contact with their legal team, which could severely hamper their ability to prepare a defense ahead of trial, they add.      Being accused of non-violent crimes, both Goettsche and Weeks say they would not pose any risk to society for the duration of their release. The pair also say they are unlikely to flee justice due to international travel bans and the fact their passports have already been confiscated.      Further reading: House Stimulus Bills Envision ‘Digital Dollar’ to Ease Coronavirus Recession      Last week, a New York judge granted a motion for temporary release for another individual on the grounds that crowded detention centers allowed the virus to spread more easily.

42431672,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4qdh,1585048872,Bitcoin Marches on $7K as Traditional Markets Cheer Fed’s QE 'Bazooka',"View  The U.S. Federal Reserve's open-ended easing program is a long-run positive for bitcoin's (BTC) price, according to analysts.  With stocks flashing green and technical indicators pointing to a strengthening of upward momentum, bitcoin looks set to test resistance at $7,000.  Monday's low of $5,686 is the level to beat for the bears.    Bitcoin is marching northwards as the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary economic measures boosts risk appetite in the traditional markets.      The top cryptocurrency by market value rose as high as $6,863 early Tuesday, having jumped from $5,700 to $,6600 on Monday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      A major part of Monday’s double-digit price rise came after the Fed announced its ""bazooka"" move to expand asset purchases by as much as needed (that is, with no upper limit) to help the economy absorb shocks arising from the coronavirus pandemic.    Good for bitcoin?    There's now a general consensus in the analyst community that the unconventional policies adopted by the Fed and other central banks could bode well for bitcoin.      “We foresee increasing capital deployment into bitcoin as a result of a ‘lack of confidence’ across central banks and governments during this volatile period,” Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack, provider of cryptocurrency trackers and index funds.      Central banks from New Zealand to Canada have reduced rates to zero and announced bond purchases over the last two weeks to counter the coronavirus-led economic slowdown. The likes of the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank have instigated negative interest rate policies.      See also: House Stimulus Bills Envision ‘Digital Dollar’ to Ease Coronavirus Recession      With central banks running out of steam to battle the virus jitters, there's scope for bitcoin to fulfill a non-correlated and decentralized value proposition, according to Neo.      Similar sentiments were echoed by popular analyst Joseph Young and Genesis Node’s co-founder David Parkinson.      Some observers are also of the opinion that the ongoing crisis will strengthen bitcoin’s appeal as ""internet money.""      Major cities across the world have been put into lockdown to stall the virus outbreak, causing a shutdown of most commercial activities. So a prolonged crisis could push people toward bitcoin as a decentralized cryptocurrency without a central bank or administrator that can be sent and received anywhere in the world at any time.      “The longer the people can’t go outside to conduct their business, the more useful the cryptocurrency should become as it can be sent and received from the safety of one’s home,” Justin Gillespie, CEO of Titus Investment Advisors and bitcoin trader told CoinDesk.      Charlie Morris, head of multi-asset management at London-based Atlantic House Fund Management said, “The crisis highlights the importance of the internet, and bitcoin is internet money. Gold lives in the real world and the refiners have shut down due to the virus. Bitcoin remains unscathed, which will broaden its appeal and lead to network growth.""      ""Bitcoin will emerge from this crisis in better shape, with more credibility than it has ever enjoyed before,” Morris said.    Not there yet    While the long-run prospects look bright, the cryptocurrency’s immediate trajectory will likely be heavily influenced by action in the stock markets.      The 90-day correlation between bitcoin’s price and the S&P 500 recently rose to 0.52, the highest level on record, according to Arcane Research.      Global equities are flashing green at press time, possibly in response to the Fed’s all-out effort in combating recession fears. The Euro Stoxx 50 – Europe’s benchmark equity index – is currently up 5.5 percent on the day, while futures tied to the S&P 500 are reporting a 5 percent gain. Stocks in Asia also put in a positive performance.      What’s more, gold, the classic haven asset, has added 4 percent and trading near $1,600. The metal rose by 3 percent on Monday.      As a result, bitcoin could challenge the psychological resistance of $7,000 in the next 24 hours or so. Technical studies, too, are painting a bullish picture.    Daily chart    Bitcoin jumped 11.7 percent on Monday, engulfing Sunday's negative price action and signaling a continuation of the recovery rally from recent lows below $4,000.      The 14-day relative strength index has breached the descending trendline in favor of the bulls, while the MACD histogram has crossed above zero, confirming a bullish reversal.      Next, resistance at $7,139 (March 20 high) could come into play.      “With the price now making higher highs and higher lows in the short term, this suggests we could get back to $7,000 in the coming days,"" Simon Peters, analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro told CoinDesk. ""However, we'll have to see if the markets have enough momentum to break and importantly stay above this level, or if we see the $7,000 level hold as resistance and the price retreat, as we saw March 20.”      See also: Unlimited QE and Why Markets Can’t Price In COVID-19      A failure to make a sustained move above the resistance of the descending 5-week moving average at $6,910 could yield a drop to $6,500.      The outlook, however, would turn bearish only below Monday's low of $5,686. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $6,720, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.

The contracts, going live Wednesday, will use the world's largest stablecoin by market cap as both the quote and settlement currency for two-way trades, enabling traders to hold both long and short positions at the same time and with different levels of leverage.      All profits, losses and account balances will be denominated in USDT, making it clearer and easier for traders to make investment decisions using USDT, the firm says. Using a stablecoin also removes the volatility brought by non-pegged cryptocurrencies.

Similar to Bybit’s existing perpetual contracts denominated in bitcoin, the USDT contracts will have no expiry date, and the price will be attached to the underlying index.    With other contracts, a trader must hold account balances in multiple currencies because profits and losses are denominated in the currency underlying the contract. If they receive a margin call, it means filling their margin using the relevant asset underlying the contract.      With the new USDT perpetuals, the process is more simplified for traders wishing to utilize cross-margin to make use of unrealized profit on their account. That profit can be used as a top-up margin for other existing positions as well as across other contracts, Bybit says.

42431668,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4qVh,1585040400,Emin Gün Sirer's AVA Labs Seeks Wall Street Business After Open Sourcing 'Avalanche' Protocol,"AVA Labs, the first project building on the “Avalanche protocol” blockchain network, is looking to modernize financial infrastructure.      As first envisioned in a 2018 white paper by the pseudonymous “Team Rocket,” Avalanche protocol uses random network sampling to reach consensus. But it is AVA Labs' ambition in building new infrastructure for the financial markets thatnow drives the firm forward.      The new platform could have special value for financial infrastructure and applications, not just in decentralized finance (DeFi) but for Wall Street firms, too, said AVA co-founder Kevin Sekniqi. That’s why the team decided to base itself in Brooklyn, N.Y., instead of the more tech-savvy Bay Area in California, where Sekniqi admits AVA Labs’ “hackers and engineers at heart” might fit in more naturally. AVA open sourced its initial codebase on March 11.      See also: Long-Festering DeFi Dapp Bug Still Not Fixed by Industry      AVA is now looking to move even closer to New York’s financial gearworks. Sekniqi has tentative plans to abandon its current Brooklyn HQ in favor of offices within striking distance of the Financial District in lower Manhattan, where physical proximity to banks, brokers and firms can raise awareness of the product.      “We’re going to have a big push in the financial sector, so we’re going to need to meet with a lot of people in that area, downtown in FiDi,” Sekniqi said.      He said those meetings could go a long way to getting institutions to take blockchain solutions more seriously. Too often there’s a breakdown in messaging in which institutions do not see the value of blockchain because they do not see how it solves their business “pain points” in digitizing assets.      “Everything is lacking right now, primarily in technology,” Sekniqi said.    The open-source Avalanche    AVA is still in the process of building its first network. To that end, it released the codebase for the Avalanche protocol earlier this month, fleshing out the technical elements for an ecosystem AVA’s founders hope will challenge the supremacy of other leading consensus families.      The launch gives the developer community a look at AVA Lab’s multiyear effort to piece together a workable source code for Avalanche.      Avalanche’s random sample method presents a significant break from two popular consensus families: Nakamoto, the proof-of-work model behind Bitcoin, and “classical,” which uses majority vote. Proponents say Avalanche takes the best of both protocols while detractors scoff at what they deem a lesser derivative.      See also: Why Polynomial Commitments Might Be a ‘Breakthrough’ for Ethereum 2.0      “We’ve been hearing from people that they want much more scalable, much faster consensus protocols,” Sekniqi said, comparing Avalanche’s protocol to Cosmos.      For its part, AVA’s leaders are betting Avalanche has the potential. Running on $6 million funding from a 2019 venture capital round, the 30-person team has been building out their mainnet backend, developing a system Sekniqi says could be the “seed” for a new generation of projects and dApps.      “It's a much better foundation for building blockchain platforms,” Sekniqi said. He admits his pro-Avalanche bias.      “Our end goal here is we want to be the platform on which all assets are issued, we really want to encompass DeFi and much more broadly alternative assets,” he said. “We’re taking a very long-term approach to this.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/24/emin-gun-sirers-ava-labs-seeks-wall-street-business-after-open-sourcing-avalanche-protocol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9f8d538406bf95405a2d2b546d33a911dc68f2f6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The deal represents an about-face for Chainalysis, one of the industry’s most prominent crypto surveillance developers and regular partner of exchanges, governments and private companies. It had never signed on a peer-to-peer client because these firms were seen as too risky to conduct business with, said John Dempsey, Chainalysis’ vice president of Product.      “I think previously we categorically viewed P2P exchanges as a high-risk category,” he told CoinDesk.      In a P2P model parties move cryptocurrency directly between their wallets with no financial institution processing the trade. That represents a purer form of crypto dealmaking: bitcoin was envisioned as a decentralized P2P network, after all.      But P2P exchanges often play it fast and loose on the regulatory compliance front, said Chainalysis’ Marketing Director Maddie Kennedy. Some flout know-your-customer laws by allowing their users to work without an account, let alone identification required by law.      That tainted the category’s reputation and made Chainalysis hesitant to partner with any P2P exchange. “This is a reputational risk for us,” said Dempsey, the Chainalysis exec.      Dempsey said Paxful came to Chainalysis looking for investigative tools. The company agreed to a partnership after seeing Paxful had “transformed its business model to prioritize compliance,” according to Kennedy.      Paxful Chief Compliance Officer Lana Schwartzman told CoinDesk the exchange began pivoting in “early 2019” after it realized its future depended on toeing the regulatory line. She joined the company in late 2018.      Earlier that year, Paxful co-founder Ray Youssef had told CoinDesk his exchange was “redoing our entire KYC [know your customer] process.”      The biggest playmakers in crypto are centralized exchanges.

42431664,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4qPh,1585022400,Yale Researchers Turn to Hyperledger to Track Carbon Emissions,"In our current state of lockdown, it may sound facile to say technologies like blockchain, IoT and AI can protect us. But it’s a combination of those tools that software architects think will help mitigate the largest known existential threat we face today: climate change.      A team from Yale University’s Open Innovation Lab (OpenLab) has been exploring how distributed ledgers, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and other data-science tools can be used to measure and track carbon emissions.      It’s a gargantuan task, but Yale’s Open Climate project has been laying the foundations for a global carbon accounting mechanism that can be compatible with the Paris Agreement, the United Nations framework for holding the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.      “I understand climate change as a big picture, managing our global planetary carbon budget,” said Martin Wainstein, the founder of the Yale OpenLab. “To me, that translated into an accounting problem.”      One of Open Climate’s recent collaborative forays has been within the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger blockchain greenhouse, where Wainstein now co-chairs a climate action and accountability working group.      Following Open Climate’s work with identity-focused Hyperledger projects Indy and Aries, Wainstein said a climate change focus could be in the cards, similar to the Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain’s focus on supply chain, known as Grid.      “I do think that eventually, it would make sense to have a domain-specific framework similar to HL Grid for climate,” Wainstein said. “We will have a more consolidated development and announcement probably in the next couple of months.”      The BC approach    Wainstein’s climate accountability group has been working with the government of British Columbia (BC) on a project to use Hyperledger’s digital identity domains to track and verify oil wells in the Canadian province.      Attributes of an oil well such as its GPS location and the like can be viewed in the form of a verifiable credential, issued by BC’s digital identity system, which incorporates DLT within its architecture. The idea is to be able to track the carbon footprint of wells.      “We are very interested in BC’s work around verified credentials for oil well permits,” said Wainstein. “The way that they are designed, you have a verified credential for an oil permit and the same architecture for the credential for an IoT device that is reporting on how that oil well is being used, and a verified credential of the company operating that. So you go all the way up until the sub-national level accounting using its own verified credential.”      Verifiable credentials are a way of establishing trust relations between entities. Like digital versions of physical credentials (such as passports or credit cards), they can be presented and verified on a peer-to-peer basis. A strong digital identity uses cryptographic signatures derived from public key infrastructure (PKI), but is decentralized.      Rather than centralized checking authorities (the way browsers work on the internet), a blockchain can be used as a kind of “public keyring,” so issuers of verifiable credentials can make their public key(s) globally discoverable and available via the DLT.      It’s a much “lighter” way to use a blockchain than, for example, writing transactions to the chain or storing transaction data there.      “We don’t frame our work as ‘blockchain,’ nor do we face issues about blockchain adoption,” said John Jordan, the Province of British Columbia’s executive director of emerging digital initiatives. “Yes, there is a blockchain involved but it is deep down in the technical layers and is not relevant to the end user, nor the services that will be able to issue, verify and revoke credentials.”      Another Open Climate collaboration involves incorporating digitally verifiable credentials into Verses Labs’ “spatial web” protocol, a virtual mapping of space using IoT sensors and artificial intelligence. It’s a way to “express actions in the real world but manage them in the digital world,” said Wainstein.    Auditing opportunity    Accurately accounting for carbon using new digital protocols also presents “a huge opportunity” to the tech-savvy “big four” accounting firms, said Wainstein.      Deloitte, KPMG, EY and PwC jointly released a paper at this year’s environmentally focused World Economic Forum in Davos titled “Toward Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation.” But none of the four were immediately available for comment on the subject of carbon accounting.      “I have been having talks with some of the Big Four [accounting firms], explaining how carbon accounting is going to be a huge part of their business in the future,” said Wainstein. “I think they are starting to understand. We have been focusing on the tech side of the design and then hope to incorporate them at a later track, in which they can start working at consortium level.”      When it comes to consortia building, the lesson from previous years is to take things in stages, as opposed to breathlessly adding big names, first and foremost. Open Climate, for instance, is currently in the first stage, which involves gathering philanthropic capital and an association of nonprofits, particularly universities and high-level institutions to work together. Getting a base layer of entities in place that don't necessarily have a vested interest is important, Wainstein said.      “Around early next year, if everything goes well, we will create the model for funding in a consortium where you bring in corporate assets. But that is only after you already have the governance mechanism,” he said.      The next immediate step is the Open Climate Collabathon, which takes place in April. Last year’s Collabathon was organized by the Yale lab alone and brought together some 400 developers and climate researchers, with two-thirds located onsite in various campus nodes.
