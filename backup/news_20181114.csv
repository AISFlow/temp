42402189,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3deU,1542235293,The Crypto Market Just Fell to a New 2018 Low,"Bitcoin sank to its lowest price in over a year on Wednesday, with the prices of other major cryptocurrencies falling alongside it.  As of press time, bitcoin is trading at $5,525.92 – a more than 12 percent decline on the day – in the latest sign that volatility around the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has returned with a vengeance.  Indeed, bitcoin's collective market cap dropped below the $100 billion level for the first time since November 12 of last year, according to CoinDesk’s Crypto-Economics Explorer (CEX).  In the past 12-hours alone, the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market fell from roughly $210 billion to where it stands now, $180 billion. Today's 15 percent depreciation has led the market to its lowest value since Oct. 31 of last year, CoinMarketCap data reveals.  Other major cryptocurrencies are reporting declines in excess of 10 percent on the day, including ETH, XRP and bitcoin cash – the latter of which is gearing up for a contentious hard fork on Nov. 15.  Notably, market data indicates that in light of today's market drop, XRP (as of the time of this writing) has the second-largest market capitalization for cryptocurrencies, surpassing ETH.  USDT, the stablecoin known more commonly as tether, saw a notable drop in its price to a low of $0.95 on crypto exchange Kraken, which offers one of the few trading pairs of the token against the U.S. dollar.  Tether, among other stablecoins, is intended to hold parity against the U.S. dollar, and data from CoinMarketCap shows that the token is trading in the $0.96-$0.97 range.  Because of the dip in USDT, the BTC premium on exchanges like Bitfinex, which trades against USDT, has risen to over $300. In other words, a single unit of bitcoin can now be purchased for $5,557 on Coinbase (a regulated exchange trading against USD) while the same unit costs $5,870 USDT on Bitfinex.

42402193,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3dhR,1542225624,How to Watch the Bitcoin Cash Fork As It Happens,"The most contentious hard fork in bitcoin cash’s one-year history is happening Thursday.  So contentious, in fact, that this one holds the potential to split the blockchain into two separate iterations of the bitcoin cash protocol – one led by developer group Bitcoin ABC and the other, Bitcoin SV, led by blockchain research company nChain.  The process itself is expected to begin at 16:40 UTC on November 15 – though whether one dominant chain will emerge will be determined in the hours that follow.  As such, cryptocurrency observers and stakeholders worldwide are lining up to watch the looming bitcoin cash hard fork, a process that will play out as miners aim their hashing power at one chain or another, as node operators update their software, and as investors and traders decide which coins to hold (and which to potentially sell).  Still, there's a lot up in the air at this point – which implementation the majority of users will support, which implementation the majority of miners will support and whether or not the main proponents of Bitcoin SV will act on threats to attack the opposing chain  With the situation still very much in flux, here's a guide for how to watch the action unfold.  Twitter chatter  In all likelihood, a good portion of the cryptocurrency community will be watching and live-tweeting how events unfold in the coming days.  If commentary leading up to the bitcoin cash hard fork is any indication, the following individuals are likely to continue offering their insights as the situation unravels:  Team ABC  Roger Ver (@rogerkver) – bitcoin angel investor since 2012 and early bitcoin cash proponent  Amaury Séchet (@deadalnix) – lead developer for Bitcoin ABC  Peter Rizun (@PeterRizun) – chief scientist for Bitcoin Unlimited  Chris Pacia (@ChrisPacia) – lead developer for e-commerce platform OpenBazaar  Jihan Wu (@JihanWu) – co-founder of crypto mining giant Bitmain  Team SV  Craig Wright (@ProfFaustus) – chief scientist of blockchain research and development firm nChain  Jimmy Nguyen (@JimmyWinMedia) – nChain CEO  Calvin Ayre (@CalvinAyre) – founder of cryptocurrency media publication and mining pool CoinGeek  Cobra (@CobraBitcoin) – co-owner of bitcoin information site bitcoin.org and discussion forum bitcointalk.org  Eli Afram (@justicemate) – writer for crypto news publication CoinGeek and founder of Bitcoin Cash Australia  Observers  Marcel Pechman (@noshitcoins) – founder of RadarBTC, a Brazilian site that provides cryptocurrency analysis and commentary for traders in Portuguese  Ryan X Charles (@ryanxcharles) – CEO of online payments tool Money Button  Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) – co-founder of cryptocurrency investment firm Altan Digital Currency Fund  In addition, it’s worth highlighting the equally popular social media platform, Reddit. The main channel to watch for bitcoin cash-related developments is /r/btc.  Fork execution  Onlookers will also need some way of affirming that the hard fork has actually been executed.  One platform, Fork Monitor, will alert users once the hard fork goes live on the bitcoin cash blockchain.  Once the hard fork is executed, Fork Monitor's sponsor, BitMex, stated that the exchange will feature settled prices for the Bitcoin ABC compatible blockchain and exclude ""the value of Bitcoin SV.""  Other exchanges haven’t been so quick to take sides, especially given the ongoing threats of chain sabotage that may result in a prolonged struggle between the two bitcoin cash networks.  Yet, many are hoping that a clear winner will be undeniable.  ""If there's a split with an ambiguous, unclear winner where one side is slightly ahead of the other, that's a really bad situation because ... it creates tremendous confusion for people,"" Ryan X. Charles, CEO of Money Button, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Bitcoin cash is already difficult enough to understand. The split would be a problem.”  Who's got the nodes?  Finally, the progression of the hard fork once implemented can be gauged by watching the numerical estimates of node distribution.  CashNode  indicates the proportional and geographical spread of computer servers running Bitcoin ABC software and Bitcoin SV software, among other compatible bitcoin cash implementations such as Bitcoin Unlimited.  Similarly, data tracking site Coin Dance also relays information about what nodes are operating on the blockchain. Among other details, the site displays which implementations are being used both at present and historically.  All of these platforms will provide useful insight into the bitcoin cash debate both before, during and after, which according to some, such as Bitcoin Unlimited chief scientist Peter Rizun, isn’t just a technical debate but a “political battle.”  “I see this fork more as a social or political battle playing out but it's disguised as a technical debate,"" he told CoinDesk.  Correction: Ryan X Charles CEO of Money Button is in the observers camp and Peter Rizun chief scientist for Bitcoin Unlimited is in the Team ABC camp.

42376263,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWx9jxl,1542212735,"CoinDesk Launches the Crypto-Economics Explorer, A New Way to Visualize Crypto","How do you measure a crypto asset? For years, the easy answer has been to look at its price.  When we launched the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) — the world’s first index for bitcoin – in September 2013, we were at the forefront of creating an average price using multiple exchanges. The goal was to create a reference rate for a new form of asset, one that would help it be better understood on its way to greater adoption.  Since then, the BPI has established itself as a gold standard for journalists (our own and others), researchers and investors, while bitcoin, the world’s oldest and most valuable crypto asset, has birthed a new economy.  But the market for crypto assets has expanded dramatically and it is no secret this growth has outpaced understanding of what remains a novel technology phenomenon.  As the market has grown in complexity, there’s been no shortage of data providers rushing to market. But how sound were their insights?  Often excluded in available tools are many of the essential elements that we know have propelled the growth of crypto assets — developer interest, social activity, even the use of a crypto asset’s blockchain.  At CoinDesk, we believe we’ve created a more comprehensive way to view cryptocurrency market data, a one-of-a-kind product that, for the first time, let’s anyone visualize a complete picture of a crypto asset market.  Rather than price alone, our tool relies on the full range of data now being assessed in the field of crypto-economics, a word that while perhaps unfamiliar, has come to describe the study of crypto asset economies.  Since its advent, the discipline has been developed and refined by industry leaders. Now for the first time, we’re putting these factors at your fingertips, for your exploration.  A measuring tool  The CoinDesk Crypto-Economics Explorer is a tool designed to offer a more complete picture of the economic activity for crypto assets. With our new data insight product, you can explore the extent to which exchanges are supporting their economics and if developers are actively working to improve their core code.  The result of our work is a suite of 28 factors related to price, exchange, network effect, developer base and social data that allows you to measure crypto assets against each other and against bitcoin.  To normalize our data, we created the Bitcoin Benchmark, which makes it easier to compare bitcoin and other crypto assets.  You can read the full breakdown of the Crypto-Economics Explorer here.  The benchmark is a proprietary volume-weighted price index that draws from market prices across 16 different exchanges. We take these prices, as well as the market cap, and compress that information into a single data point.  This takes the form of a percentage that can be used to compare the price activity of any asset relative to bitcoin.  Beyond prices  But as we’ve said, looking at the price is just one way to measure a network’s health – one that doesn’t exactly indicate if a crypto asset is actually being used.  Our Exchange Benchmark looks to expand on what is currently tracked by including factors such as the total value transacted at crypto exchanges and trading volumes.  However, we ask a variety of other questions. How many exchanges list the crypto asset? How many trading pairs does that asset have across exchanges? And what volume of fiat currency is it exchanged for — a good indicator of the amount of liquidity moving in and out of crypto exchanges.  Our Network Benchmark looks at data points specific to the blockchain in question like the number of on-chain transactions, mining profitability and how many nodes are running the software. The combination of these data points can show us how the network attracts miners, merchants and other key economic actors.  Our Developer Benchmark looks to measure how active the developer base of an asset is, answering questions such as, How many developers are working on the protocol? How much code is being proposed, tested and committed on GitHub?  Our Social Benchmark demonstrates a unique phenomena in crypto: that discussion, debate and even governance predominantly take place on social networks. This data point measures how many followers and subscribers a project has across several platforms and seeks to indicate how much interest there is in the network.  These five scores, when combined, provide the first Crypto-Economics Explorer rankings benchmarked to bitcoin.  To be clear, an asset can have benchmark scores that are higher than bitcoin’s and we fully expect to see this as we observe their growth and development in the years to come.  Getting involved  What you’re seeing today is just the first version of what we hope will become the industry standard for visualizing the health and growth of the world’s major crypto assets.  Already, we’re developing new ways to examine and explore the vast amount of data produced by cryptocurrency networks – and we’ll be shipping those features as part of our broader developmental roadmap for the Crypto-Economics Explorer.  Simply put, the tool you see today will change, evolve and grow along with the ecosystem itself – and we’re hoping that you, our users, can be a part of that process.  If you work with a project that is not represented in the Crypto-Economics Explorer and want to see your data represented, we’re excited to work with you to collect this data and add it to the Crypto-Economics Explorer.  Please email our research team  to share more information.  We encourage you to use the tool, compare various assets and tell us what you think.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Nolan Bauerle,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/14/coindesk-launches-the-crypto-economics-explorer-a-new-way-to-visualize-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88f6acbe39c3c78be759f09d00ee588ae59fae9e-2440x1278.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402182,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3brJ,1542212132,Crypto Traders Now See No Winner in Bitcoin Cash Fork,"Early trading indicates crypto investors may no longer believe Bitcoin ABC, today the dominant software used to run the bitcoin cash blockchain, will hold on to its leading position following an expected fork tomorrow.  At press time, exchange markets set up in advance to offer traders a choice between Bitcoin ABC and its expected challenger, Bitcoin SV, show Bitcoin ABC has lost its early edge. After trading for more than $300 above the price of Bitcoin SV, data shows Bitcoin ABC, represented by the ticker symbol BCHABC, is now nearly trading at parity.  Data shows coins on a hypothetical BCHABC blockchain are now trading at $253, while those on a BCHSV blockchain are priced at $216, according to Poloniex.  At 9:00 UTC, BCHSV was even briefly the price leader, a significant development considering the price of BCHABC was 10 times higher than BCHSV on Nov. 9th, when they were trading at $540 and $55 respectively.  In fact, BCHABC was able to maintain a price nearly four times higher up until yesterday, when BCHSV's investor interest started to significantly increase.  BCHSV has amassed nearly double the 24-hour trading volume as BCHABC on Poloniex, registering over $3 million in volume while BCHABC is recording just $1.23 million.  All of this follows the decision by popular cryptocurrency exchange, Poloniex to launch an experimental market they termed ‘pre-fork trading’ where placeholder token for BCHABC and BCHSV could be traded in order to allow the community to decide which blockchain it will support.  Bitfinex launched a similar market yesterday, which introduced Chain Split Tokens (CSTs) that allow traders to trade tokens representing value on each of the competing blockchains that could result from tomorrow's fork.  Mining moves  A key drive of this change is that more mining pool operators are supporting Bitcoin SV, meaning that its blockchain could have more dedicated computing power securing transactions.  As seen on CoinDance, the two major mining pools in support of Bitcoin SV – SVPool and CoinGeek – currently hold roughly 60 percent of the total hash power now dedicated to bitcoin cash. Plus, other mining pools that support Bitcoin SV bring the total hash power towards that implementation to a little over 78 percent.  This number is up from 76 percent yesterday and 73.6 percent earlier in the week.  The numbers suggest those supporting Bitcoin SV could even have enough computing power so as to launch attacks on a Bitcoin ABC, should a minority of computers continue to support that network. Such a move has been suggested by Bitcoin SV project leaders, including Craig Wright, the Australian cryptographer who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto and who is leading development of Bitcoin SV.  That being said, Peter Rizun, chief scientist at Bitcoin Unlimited, another implementation for bitcoin cash, believes the hash power numbers may look different after the hard fork is actually activated and those dedicating computing power to the network are forced to actually allocate resources.  Rizun told CoinDesk:  ""I think their estimate is probably reasonable for right now ... There is a huge pool of hash power mining [bitcoin] that can come over to [bitcoin cash] when the time is right. Don’t read too much into the [percentages] right now.""

42402175,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3bjR,1542208508,Kik Selects Stellar Over Ethereum for Token Launch,"Messenger app maker Kik is quitting ethereum for good as it continues to develop its cryptocurrency, dubbed kin.  Launched on ethereum early in the ICO boom, Kik has now announced that it will close kin's atomic swap with ethereum. Without specifying a date, the Kin Ecosystem Foundation said Wednesday that it would soon release a tool for kin holdings off of ethereum.  Kik's token has had several homes in its short life.  The company raised just shy of $100 million in crypto during a September 2017 initial coin offering. By November, ethereum scaling issues resulted in talk that kin could find its way onto an alternative blockchain – something that Kik founder and CEO Ted Livingston later confirmed that December.  By March, Kik had developed a two-chain strategy slated for stellar, with ethereum for security and stellar for speed; the plan was that users could switch back and forth.  Then, in May, Kik determined that even stellar's extremely low transaction fees were too much at scale, so it decided to fork stellar so it could eliminate transaction costs entirely. Kik's Ory Band recently gave a talk on the advantages to kin with pursuing a federated consensus model.  Now, Kik is breaking away from ethereum entirely.  Reiterating his goal to make kin the most used cryptocurrency in the world, Livingston said in a release:  “One Kin on one blockchain. That’s our vision, and our strategy continues evolving as we work toward building an infrastructure that supports this.”  Flown the coop  Kik isn't the first company to start building on ethereum only shift away to alternative platforms. Indeed, ethereum has served as an incubation hub of sorts for a number of tokens that later broke away.  For example, EOS and Tron both migrated their tokens off the original blockchain that made their fundraising possible.  For the Kin Foundation, the network's limitations hit home especially hard when some of its early network testing in December became impossible due to the growing activity around the CryptoKitties app.  The matter has since become more urgent as the team rolls out new mobile products designed to give users ways to both earn and spend kin.  A spokesperson for the Kin Foundation explained that it has been making arrangements with exchanges, ensuring that as users move their tokens onto exchanges, they will make a one-way move onto the kin blockchain – burning the original ERC-20 token in the process.  There's no deadline for users to make the move, however. The spokesperson said that existing users can sit on their tokens on ethereum as long as they like.

42402167,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3bbZ,1542207675,Bitcoin Veteran Jameson Lopp Named CTO of Crypto Startup Casa,"One of the bitcoin community’s most beloved veterans just got a promotion.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Casa has elevated Jameson Lopp to CTO eight months after he joined the crypto custody solutions startup as an infrastructure engineer. In this newly-created position, Lopp will focus on making sure the company's products complement its annual $10,000 premium vault service with a waiting list that already includes hundreds of bitcoin users.  For example, the startup has sold more than 500 Casa Lightning Nodes, a device introduced in early September which taps into a second-layer scaling solution for bitcoin transactions called the Lightning Network.  ""We’ve only shipped our first batch, but it’s actually conceivable that if our current sales continue at the pace that they have been, by the end of the year Casa nodes could make up 20-25 percent all the Lightning nodes on the network,"" Lopp told CoinDesk.  Already, Casa nodes constitute roughly 12 percent of the 4,000-or-so nodes operating on the Lightning Network. The device allows users to just plug in, sync up the full bitcoin node that's included inside, and start operating a Lightning channel within minutes if the user has some bitcoin. Without such products, operating a Lightning node requires an unusually high level of computer literacy, the type that restricts its use to programmers and tech-savvy hobbyists.  For Lopp, the node is more than just a way to facilitate small everyday transactions in bitcoin through lightning. Rather, it's a way to help make good on the cryptocurrency’s liberating promise.  He said:  ""This is the ultimate level of self-sovereignty where you are yourself validating everything yourself on the device sitting there in your house.""  Walking the walk  Indeed, a fervent desire to make self-sovereign technical solutions more accessible was precisely what inspired Lopp to leave the institution-centric custody startup BitGo, where he was a backend engineer, to join Casa in March.  Lopp is perhaps best known in the community for going ""off-the-grid"" earlier this year to live with his guns, Tolkienesque beard, an arsenal of wilderness-friendly gadgets. He applies the same homesteader mentality to managing financial assets as well.  ""It’s perfectly fine if people choose to trust a third party. But the whole reason we got into this system in the first place is that people don’t have to do that if they don’t want to,” Lopp said. “Having a non-custodial wallet where each user is their own bank is the first step of that.”  In Casa’s vault service, which launched this past summer, includes a mobile app that works with the client’s own Trezor or Ledger hardware wallets, creating a multisignature storage system where Casa holds just one out of five keys as an emergency backup. The mobile app hosts yet another set of keys and the client can keep others elsewhere.  Completing a transaction will require three out of the five keys, so if, say, the hardware wallet is stolen, the user’s money is still safe. Subscribers also have various alerts and notifications to help keep their devices and systems up-to-date.  As a service-oriented startup, Casa will focus on tricks and tools to help such subscribers manage long-term bitcoin storage, including inheritance planning and protecting their hardware wallets. In addition to upkeep on the bitcoin-centric node product and key management service, Lopp will help develop complementary products and investigate how to keep all these devices safely up-to-date when Casa adds support for other blockchain-based assets beyond bitcoin.  “I do see complexities and trade-offs coming in to play as we become an organization that supports a wider variety of systems,” he said. “So it will be fun to tackle that.”  Speaking to his broader vision for Casa hardware products, Lopp concluded:  “I’m just trying to merge together best practices that are hard to understand or create a huge learning curve, and package them in a way that’s simplified….you want to get a kit that includes everything you need and follow some simple instructions.”  Image via Jameson Lopp",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TRADING | WALLET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/14/bitcoin-veteran-jameson-lopp-named-cto-of-crypto-startup-casa,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39aed002f4f0b11372eed3f828c1318edb685805-1500x860.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402170,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3bfV,1542204011,The $799 Coinmine One Will Look Like an Xbox and Mint Crypto Money,"Try as startups might, crypto mining hasn't yet had an everyman device.  Smart money, however, is betting that will change at the hands of a new company called Coinmine. Announced Wednesday, the startup is revealing its first product, the Coinmine One, a hardware device aimed at crypto enthusiasts who'd like to earn rewards for mining blockchains – without the need to learn a new technical skill set.  Backed by investors including Coinbase Ventures and Arrington Capital, angel investors Balaji Srinivasan (now CTO of Coinbase and a former mining entrepreneur), Morgan Creek partner Anthony Pompliano and Product Hunt co-founder Ryan Hoover also participated in the undisclosed funding.  The Coinmine One will retail for $799 and start shipping in mid-December, though the company declined to give a precise date or name a specific goal for sales. Still, CEO Farbood Nivi told CoinDesk in interview that the company believes its mining product has mass-market appeal.  Nivi explained:  ""We think there's a market for millions, if not tens of millions.""  One investor, Chapter One Ventures, explicitly backed the project because it wants to see more ways for everyday people to get involved in supporting cryptocurrency infrastructure.  ""Coinmine will democratize access to becoming a miner in a fun and approachable way that almost feels like playing a video game,"" its founder, Jeff Morris, Jr., told CoinDesk.  Digging into the details  For $799, the Coinmine One will sport a miner that can generate any one of the following out of the box: ether (ETH) at 29 Mh/sec, monero (XMR) at 900 h/sec, zcash (ZEC) at 320 h/sec and ether classic. With updates next year, it also expects to be able to run a stake for a Bitcoin Lightning node, Dfinity or Filecoin.  It uses roughly as much power (120 watts) as a PlayStation 3 during game play and runs at 40 decibels (quiet compared to the cacophony created by other mining products). With a profile like the one above, most people probably wouldn't be horrified about it being visible in a room that a guest might visit.  More importantly, in an effort to make the product as user-friendly as possible, the system will be automatically updated as changes are made on the protocol and as more coins become available. Users will be able to monitor their earnings and manage them using an Android or iOS app (seen below).  If the company is right and consumers love it, don't look for today's mining hobbyists to agree. There's nothing about its specs that compares to other miners sold on the market today that those much more tech savvy users are using. Coinmine One's hash rate is much lower than those devices, and the price for its hash rate is higher.  But these issues, Nivi argues, miss a larger point.  Even if the current miners cost a third as much, he says they would still be out of reach to normal people: the ones who don’t know how to set them up or lack a place to store and operate hardware heats up quickly and generates a lot of noise. And they won't know how to update them when protocols change, either.  Nivi and his company are betting, therefore, that there are people who want a way to participate in mining but want a lower path of entry. Another way to think of Coinmine is that it’s building on the market concept proven by what Honeyminer runs on PCs.  The CEO emphasizes the fact that the Coinmine One will remove some of the hardest work from users. He said: ""The one thing that's consistent in crypto is that it's constantly changing and evolving. Coinmine is the only solution that makes it possible to continually be a part of that.""  Home mining is hard  That said, the business of selling home miners has not gone well historically.  Names like Butterfly Labs, Alpha Technology and GAW Miners comprise just part of a long history of mining product makers that didn’t stand the test of time (or didn’t devolve into outright fraud).  Other companies failed to balance the production-intensive process of making hardware with the demands of retail customers – particularly when the making of that hardware didn’t go according to plan. Even those that played the game by the book were unable to survive for the long-term, especially when contending with the downturn in cryptocurrency prices in 2015.  Case in point: a little piece of home mining history wrapped up this year when Josh Garza was convicted of wire fraud.  Garza's company, GAWMiners, first made its mark by reselling imported mining equipment, and later expanded its business by hosting miners and then, later, offering so-called “virtual miners” that were later deemed securities.  Ultimately, it was Bitmain – with its economy-of-scale, access to cheap power and operation of mining services on both the hardware and software side – that came out on top, though other companies have emerged with possible competitive edges. And to this day, Bitmain still makes budget miners that could be affordable for a middle-class American consumer who owns a big garage (and a patient family tolerant of noise).  And yet it only takes a glance at any of these products to see an immediate difference from Coinmine One. ASIC miners look like enormous shoe boxes with a fan in a cage stuck to one end, like something that really doesn't belong anywhere but a garage (unless someone wants to try to use one as a way of providing electric heating, an approach CoinDesk once proposed).  More importantly, the prior generation of miners look like companies took their pro versions and scaled them down a bit in price, noise and voltage, without fundamentally rethinking the design or user experience.  ""If you go and buy these crypto devices online they sound like there is a vacuum cleaner running constantly,"" Nivi said.  At 40 decibels, the Coinmine One shouldn't even be noticeable, and, with its low electricity consumption, a user’s utility bills shouldn't jump aggressively. Which isn't to say that the business will be any easier, but it does support their case that the devices exist in a new category.  The HODLer Argument  The evolution of miners from home-based enthusiasts to industrial-scale behemoths highlights the fundamental business model of a miner: a kind of arbitrage where profits are made when the cost of energy is lower than the return on the cryptocurrencies mined and sold.  But Nivi argues that the Coinmine One is intended technology enthusiasts rather than profit seekers – as in, people who want to try out different protocols and interact with the communities behind them – while also having some skin in the game. More broadly, it's for people with a long-time horizon who aren’t focused on making enough cash to keep the lights on and miners humming.  The Coinmine One isn’t single-use hardware, either. That said, it can only run one of a few proof-of-work tokens at a time. With forthcoming updates, it will also be able to run one of several proof-of-stake tokens as well.  This differentiates it from most other miners, built to mine as much as possible of just one coin. Take for example these two ETH miners. They cost twice as much but they also deliver about six times more hash power.  That might make it sound like Coinmine One is a bad deal, but that depends on a person's situation. Someone living in an urban apartment, for example, could never run one of those miners, even if they could afford it.  The startup appears to be aiming to create a new product category in the mining sector.  ""The real magic of the product is the software and hardware compatibility, which reminds me of Nest or Ring,"" Morris told CoinDesk, referring to the unicorn startups that built mobile-enabled home thermostat and home security devices. Each were subsequently acquired at unicorn valuations, by Google and Amazon, respectively.  Even still, is the Coinmine One worth it?  One danger some users might foresee is that lots of people will buy it making the tokens it mines less lucrative for each miner. Nivi points out that they will keep adding new tokens, giving users options. Furthermore, though, he also contends that more miners means more value for what miners do earn.  ""While more people mining a coin can decrease the amount of coins you earn, it also increases the value of the network,"" he said.  Normally, in discussion of mining equipment, users calculate how long it will take them to recoup their capital expenditure in fiat from earnings in crypto. In conversation with CoinDesk, Nivi rejected that short-term analysis.  He said:  ""If you're doing this from home, it's bad advice to buy and sell. You really should hold. You're holding and waiting for it to 10X, 100X or 1000X.""

42402184,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3bsI,1542196802,Bitcoin Price Charts 'Death Cross' In First Since 2014,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price woes may not be over just yet, as a key technical indicator is about to turn bearish for the first time in four years.  On the three-day chart, the 50-candle simple moving average (SMA) looks set to cut the 200-candle SMA from above, confirming what is popularly known as the ""death cross."" This specific bearish crossover was last seen in December 2014.  The onset of a death cross can be a warning that a bear market is looming, according to technical theory. In reality, however, it is the result of a prolonged bear market – i.e., it's a backward-looking indicator. As a result, the oversold market usually sees a bounce after a bearish crossover is confirmed.  In this case, the crossover looks likely to occur in the next few days. The bulls, however, are cautioned against betting on a follow-up price jump immediately, as prices dropped 50 percent in the four weeks following the death cross confirmation in mid-December 2014.  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,185 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.8 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  3-day chart  On the three-day chart, the impending death cross can be seen as the confluence of the 50-candle and 200-candle simple moving average (SMA), which have closed sharply in the last three months.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) of 41.00 is biased toward the bears and holding well above the oversold territory (below 30.00).  Therefore, prices could be in for a deeper drop in the short-term, possibly to levels below the June low of $5,774.  It's worth noting that the sell-off witnessed after the death cross seen in December 2014 ended up carving a long-term bottom at $152 in January 2015. On similar lines, the impending crossover and the resulting slide in prices, if any, could turn out to be the final leg of the bear market.  As for today, the cryptocurrency is looking weak, having found acceptance below the trendline connecting the Oct. 11 and Oct. 31 lows.  Daily chart  Over on the daily chart, the violation of the ascending trendline support is backed by the downward sloping 5- and 10-day SMAs. This backs up the view that deeper losses toward $6,000 could be in the offing in the next 24 hours.  View  The upcoming death cross on the three-day chart could push prices below the June low of $5,774 but might mark the final leg of the current bear market.  The long-awaited bullish reversal is seen gathering steam above the 50-candle SMA on the 3-day chart, currently at $6,629.  A move above $7,400 (September high) would signal completion of the bullish reversal.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

In a prepared speech for the Singapore Fintech Festival on Wednesday, Lagarde said:  “I believe we should consider the possibility to issue digital currency. There may be a role for the state to supply money to the digital economy.”  Various central banks around the world are ""seriously"" considering the issuance of digital currency, including Canada, China, Sweden and Uruguay, she said. ""They are embracing change and new thinking – as indeed is the IMF.""  Lagarde noted that major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum and XRP, are also ""vying for a spot in the cashless world, constantly reinventing themselves in the hope of offering more stable value, and quicker, cheaper settlement.""  However, at the same time, the IMF has also again criticized the view that public cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to CBDCs.  In a new report, titled ""Casting Light on Central Bank Digital Currency"" and revealed Wednesday alongside Lagarde's speech, the IMF said ""cryptocurrencies are different along many dimensions and struggle to fully satisfy the functions of money, in part because of erratic valuations.""  When evaluating different forms of money in the report such as cash, cryptocurrencies, private e-money and commercial bank deposits, the IMF concluded that ""cryptocurrencies are the least attractive option.""  The organization went on to say that cryptocurrencies received a low score in settlement speed due to ""current technological limitations,"" though it acknowledged they do offer the advantage of anonymity, while tech limitations may eventually be overcome.  Yet, the IMF says that research on digital currency should continue “resolutely” given that the questions to be answered are “deep and difficult and have far-reaching implications.”  While there seems to be a move towards digital currency, it is not without its risks. Lagarde said in her speech that digital currency offers “great promise” in terms of financial inclusion and also provides privacy in payments, but at the same time it could also pose risks to financial integrity and stability.  There is a trade-off between privacy and financial integrity too, she said, adding that central banks might design a digital currency, but ""anti-money laundering and terrorist financing controls would nevertheless run in the background.""  Lagarde said:  ""This setup would be good for users, bad for criminals, and better for the state, relative to cash. Of course, challenges remain.

42402173,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3biS,1542171625,Bank of America Wins Crypto Storage Patent,"A patent awarded to the Bank of America outlines how enterprise-level institutions may be able to store cryptocurrencies owned by their customers.  The filing, awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Tuesday, contends that large companies – specifically enterprise-level institutions – may want to store cryptocurrencies for customers should they see wider adoption.  There is an increasing number of enterprises which may transact with cryptocurrencies or offer services related to them, including crypto exchanges and custodians, according to the patent – and some of these businesses may be required to convert a deposit of some currency into a cryptocurrency to then hold.  In order to securely hold these funds, a business may therefore wish to use a single enterprise-level account capable of storing cryptocurrencies.  The document suggests that a customer account may be credited with an equivalent value to their cryptocurrency deposits, though the funds themselves would be stored in an aggregated enterprise account.  As the patent explains:  ""Enterprises may handle a large number of financial transactions on a daily basis. As technology advances, financial transactions involving cryptocurrency have become more common. For some enterprises, it may be desirable to aggregate cryptocurrency deposited by customers in an enterprise account.""  To that end, the bank’s system includes a processor and memory to store a private key associated with some cryptocurrency holdings. The patent goes on to describe how this system would be able to both store the holdings, as well as facilitate transactions when authorized.  This sort of system brings a number of benefits in terms of using less bandwidth and memory, as well as requiring fewer computational and power resources, according to the document.  To allow customers to conduct transactions with their funds, the system would grant the customer access to their specific account. They would then be able to execute a transaction with their cryptocurrency directly through the account.  The patent award is the latest to emerge for Bank of America in recent days. In a patent award issued late last month, Bank of America hinted at a means for storing cryptographic keys – including those tied to crypto assets – on a hardware device.
