With over 32,000 ETH burned in the space of seven days. The fee burn rate fluctuates given the network traffic, but the burn continues regardless. Depending on network traffic going forward, the burn rate is predicted to hit 4 ETH per minute very soon. Related Reading | Ethereum Set To Explode According To Market Dominance, Crypto Analyst The rate at which the ETH is burned currently sits at around 3.38 ETH per minute. This puts the current burn rate at over $10,000 burned per minute. The burn shows that the EIP-1559 upgrade is working as intended, which in the long run will hopefully make the nature of ETH deflationary. But that is not happening just yet. The burning of the base fee is still in its early stages, although it is working smoothly. It will take a while for the rate at which new ETH is burned out of circulation to be high enough that ETH&apos;s supply becomes deflationary. But that remains to be the end game here. And this is why the burn is so important to the network.

""There just isn't much of an appetite right now for bitcoin above $46,000, but you're not seeing a massive sell-off either,"" Matt Blom, head of trading at the digital-asset firm Eqonex, said Thursday in a Zoom interview.      Prices for ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest crypto overall by market cap, were also down, holding just above the $3,000 mark as of press time.      ""The crypto market is taking a breather after a week of positive price performance,"" investment-research firm FundStrat wrote in an emailed note.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $44475.6, -4.54%  Ether (ETH) $3063, -6.04%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4460.8, +0.3%  Gold: $1753.5, +0.15%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.372%, compared with 1.341% on Wednesday.    Developments on the regulatory front continued Thursday as U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to amend the crypto tax provision that was in the Senate’s infrastructure bill in an open letter.      Eshoo, described by Politico in 2014 as “Pelosi’s closest friend in Congress,” wrote that the current definition of the term “broker” for crypto tax reporting purposes is too broad and may be difficult for some entities to comply with, CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De writes.      Under the current terms of the provision, any entity that facilitates a crypto transaction on behalf of another person would be treated as a broker, meaning they would have to file specific tax information reports that would include know-your-customer details. Industry proponents are concerned that the definition of brokers would include miners and other network validators and hardware developers who don’t typically have access to customer information.      Some observers have argued that the crypto industry's pushback against the legislation shows the growing clout of a fast-developing industry that's accumulating power with growing wealth.      ""We expect investments in legal, compliance and government relations to increase and for innovation in decentralized platforms to accelerate following this battle on Capitol Hill, as crypto further entrenches itself into the mainstream consciousness,"" FundStrat wrote this week.    Crypto investments accelerate    According to a report by the accounting firm KPMG, investments in blockchain and crypto reached $8.7 billion this year through June 30. That amount already exceeds the $7.2 billion put into the industry in all of 2020.      One of the big winners of new funds is crypto-focused regulation technology, according to the report.      TaxBit, a startup that provides reporting software to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a bevy of institutional clients, said Thursday it had raised $130 million in a Series B round of funding that values the company at $1.33 billion, as reported by CoinDesk's Danny Nelson.    Intrigue deepens after Poly Network exploit as attacker returns funds    More than half of the over $600 million drained from decentralized finance platform Poly Network earlier this week has now been returned, CoinDesk's Jamie Crawley writes. Some $342 million had been returned as of 08:18 AM UTC Thursday, according to a tweet by Poly Network.      The hacker or hackers began returning the funds on Tuesday to wallet addresses across the three blockchains. The amount returned includes $4.6 million on Ethereum, $252 million on Binance Smart Chain and $85 million on Polygon. The $268 million still outstanding is on Ethereum.      In messages posted within transaction data on the Ethereum blockchain, the purported attacker or attackers wrote that they carried out the exploit ""for fun.""      “I am not very interested in money!"" according to the message posted by the Ethereum address now identified as ""Poly Network Exploiter 1."" ""I know it hurts when people are attacked, but shouldn’t they learn something from those attacks?”      Read More: DeFi Needs Hackers to Become Unhackable    Are cryptocurrency miners betting ETH 2.0 still a ways off?    Major bitcoin (BTC, -5.43%) mining firms and miner manufacturers are increasing their investments in ethereum (ETH, -8.19%) mining despite Ethereum’s impending switch to proof-of-stake, CoinDesk's David Pan writes.      Public bitcoin mining companies Hut 8 and Hive are increasing their capacities to mine ether. In the meantime, makers of mining machines like Bitmain and Innosilicon are set to release new ethereum mining machines later this year.      That investment may seem strange, given that the Ethereum system is scheduled to migrate from proof-of-work (POW) to proof-of-stake (POS) in five months, and POS mining does not require such advanced machines. The rising demand might be attributed to expectations that the migration will be delayed, industry pros said.      “We were told mining was going to end four years ago and it is still going,” said Mark D’Aria, CEO of Bitpro Cryptocurrency Consulting, which focuses on brokerage and management of Ethereum mining hardware. “It has always been a wait-and-see approach – things tend to take longer than everyone expects.”      Read More: Ethereum Miners Make Multimillion-Dollar Bet on Upgrade Delay    Money keeps pouring into crypto industry    KPMG's report showed that investments in blockchain and crypto in the first half of 2021 exceeded the total for each of the previous three years. The ""Pulse of Fintech H1'21"" report published Thursday said that the $8.7 billion in investments for the six months ended June 30 compares with whole-year totals of $7.2 billion, $5 billion and $4.3 billion for 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively.      Read More: Blockchain, Crypto Investment in H1 Topped 2018-20 Full-Year Totals, KPMG says    ""Persistent"" inflation is the opposite of ""transitory""    In the wake of Wednesday's U.S. government report showing moderating consumer prices in July, some economists are worrying aloud that some increases may be enduring – a signal that faster inflation might not be as temporary as top Federal Reserve officials led by Chairman Jerome Powell have predicted.      Inflation is a topic that's relevant to bitcoin investors who argue the cryptocurrency's price should rise as the U.S. dollar's purchasing power declines.      According a Bank of America report on Thursday, ""transitory"" drivers of inflation ebbed in July as used-car prices slowed to a 0.2% increase from June, while airline fares edged down 0.1%. Both came in below the 0.3% increase in the core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices.      But the bank's economists went on to note that ""stickier and more persistent components of inflation were solid."" Those included owners' equivalent rent and medical-care services, which both rose 0.3% month-over-month.      ""In other words, both transitory and persistent inflation are running at historically elevated levels,"" the Bank of America economists wrote.      Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the German financial giant Allianz, wrote in a column for Bloomberg Opinion that ""the heightened inflation watch is far from over."" One possibility is that employers could be forced to pay higher wages to attract and retain workers, and that they would eventually try to pass through those higher labor costs to consumers.      ""It would be better to tilt toward what company after company has been saying about cost and price pressures rather than rely on macroeconomic models that inevitably struggle to capture pandemic-related changes,"" El-Erian wrote.    Altcoin roundup:  DAO Maker losers over $7M: DAO Maker, a fundraising platform for upcoming crypto projects that has no relation to the more widely known MakerDAO, was hacked on Thursday, resulting in a loss of more than $7 million, according to China-based blockchain security analysis firm PeckShield. A total amount of 7.4 million of the dollar-linked stablecoins USDC were transferred from an Ethereum address associated with the DAO Maker attacker to decentralized exchange Uniswap in exchange for 2,261 ETH, according to PeckShield.  Chainlink Oracles Become Available on Arbitrum One: Oracles from Chainlink, a provider of data feeds to smart contracts, have been integrated into Arbitrum One, an Ethereum scaling product. Chainlink's U.S. dollar-denominated price feeds are available now, with support for new price pairs to follow, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk Thursday. Arbitrum says it is addressing a common request from smart contract developers, who require high-quality data from financial markets to power decentralized exchanges, futures and options platforms and algorithmic stablecoins.

The Bitcoin inflow is an indicator that shows the amount of BTC transferred into exchange wallets. The opposite metric is called the outflow. The difference between the inflows and outflows gives the exchange netflow. When this indicator&apos;s value is positive, it means inflows are outweighing outflows. While on the otherhand, if the netflow is negative, it implies more Bitcoin is moving out of exchanges than in. Now, here is a chart for the BTC Gemini netflow: Gemini received huge inflows shortly before the price dip | Source: CryptoQuant As the graph shows, the BTC price started moving down as soon as Gemini started noticing negative spikes in the netflow.

42424719,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWGzh,1628792431,How Crypto Can Help Nigeria's Economy,"Nigeria – Africa’s leading crude oil exporter and largest, most populous country – has about 40% of its population living below poverty levels.      The COVID-19 pandemic caused falls in the output of goods and services, which negatively affected the economy and caused thousands of jobs to be lost.      It is estimated that Nigeria's unemployment rate will reach 32.5% this year and rise even more next year.    Olumide Adesina is a Nigeria-based certified investment trader with more than a decade experience.    That's where Nigeria’s emerging crypto economy comes in.      To strengthen the development of Africa's largest economy, Nigerian regulators and stakeholders must tap into the potential inherent in crypto to improve such unimpressive economic data. We spoke to several experts from the Nigerian crypto scene to explore some of the potential benefits.    Get around the ban    A crypto economy can help Nigerians who lack bank accounts deal with many of the challenges of international trade. Crypto transactions are growing rapidly in Nigeria, which already embraces the internet. The crypto ban issued by the Nigerian central bank, prohibiting commercial banks and payment providers from dealing with crypto entities, is encouraging a young, tech-savvy population to embrace crypto for the first time.      Chartered financial analyst Temitope Busari notes that blockchain technology allows people to conduct transactions without middlemen. “Cryptocurrency obviates the bureaucracies and high charges associated with bank transfers. The African economy has benefited from digital solutions for e-payments and transfers, and new players are leveraging financial technology to provide enhanced banking solutions,"" she tells me.    Anti-inflation    In an economy riddled by hyperinflation, investment in cryptocurrencies means preserving wealth.      “Nigeria's crypto market boom is driven by the depleting value of the naira, which has seen the local currency depreciate by over 100% since 2015,” said Anthony Okafor, an adjunct professor of finance at the University of Louisville. “In an economy mired by hyperinflation and a high unemployment rate, investment in cryptocurrencies is emerging as a leading investment outlet, and a means of preserving wages and wealth.”    Read more: ‘They’d Rather Buy Bitcoin and Take That Risk’: An Interview With Paxful’s Nena Nwachukwu    Abiodun Keripe, managing director at Afrinvest Research, said crypto assets are fast becoming as an easier option for many young Nigerians looking to preserve their wealth. A large number of crypto enthusiasts have taken to digital assets as a store of value to prevent the negative impact of inflation. For context, bitcoin in 2020 returned 302.8%, while headline inflation (Nigeria CPI) stood at 15.75% year-over-year in December.      Significant numbers of Nigerians are already feeling the negative effect of the recent ban on crypto trading, which has led people have to go through third parties because traditional bank channels are barred from dealing with crypto transactions. The number of individuals exposed to questionable entities has increased.      Still, over $400 million worth of crypto assets has been traded in Nigeria this year, Statista, a market data tracker, said. Market pundits attribute that growth to the way cryptocurrency limits central banks from imposing monetary controls.      Crypto also greases the economy by offering greater liquidity, helping Nigerians move money around.      “Cryptos have provided a sufficiently liquid fiat alternative for naira holders looking to exit the local currency,” said Uwa Osadiaye, a senior vice president at FBNQuest Merchant Bank.    Remittances    The high cost of cross-border payments has prompted Nigerians in the diaspora to send money back home using digital assets.      In the first half of 2021, Nigeria led Africa’s peer-to-peer (P2P) trading volume reaching $205.7 million, with Paxful accounting for 77.2% of that and LocalBitcoins accounting for most of the rest (22.8%).      “Cross-border transfers have been expensive and unreliable. With over 3000 mobile money transfer platforms, only 3% can do cross-platform transfers. Crypto has been the best alternative so far for such transactions. The freedom that comes with it has also propelled adoption,” said Kabi Hillary, the lead of LunarCRUSH/Africa, a fast-growing real-time cryptocurrency social media analytics company.    Read more: Thriving Under Pressure: Why Crypto Is Booming in Nigeria Despite the Banking Ban    Blockchain technology can further ease numerous challenges for Nigerians when it comes to international trade, especially those who do not have bank accounts, Busari, the financial analyst, said.      According to the World Bank, there are about 350 million unbanked adults in Sub-Saharan Africa. But crypto assets can help to increase financial inclusion, allowing for fast and accessible transfers, which in turn stimulate economic growth and improve livelihoods.      “With poverty, inflation and unemployment levels at an all-time high, made worse by the outbreak of the pandemic, cryptocurrencies have presented a different opportunity for some Africans looking for an alternative source of income and protection against the economic downturns,"" Keripe of Afrinvest Research said.      Unemployed Nigerians can generate income using blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, as traditional jobs steadily become obsolete as a result of new technology. There are jobs available for those who can create crypto/blockchain products for businesses, develop crypto-related products, audit smart contracts, perform crypto forensic audits and manage projects.    Regulation needed    But crypto assets by themselves will not have an all-encompassing impact on the Nigerian economic challenges. Better regulation is needed, said Osadiaye of FBNQuest Merchant Bank. “Questions remain around transparency and crime prevention. My view is that these challenges are solvable but would require regulatory interest.      ""The approach has varied widely across countries, but I think in Nigeria's case, it might help to create a structure where the regulator has clear oversight of end-to-end crypto-based transactions. This will enable the continued crypto user adoption and increasingly divert demand from the nation's foreign exchange reserves,"" he said.      Still, a post-pandemic Africa must begin to develop its blockchain industry. The technology will adapt to meet our unique Nigerian market niche, including financial inclusion.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Olumide Adesina,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/12/how-crypto-can-help-nigerias-economy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46bda1a2ec43d134e172cf832ee9b165bdfb6e2a-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The first cryptocurrency by market still has profits in higher timeframes, but in the short term, it seems at risk of another correction. As trader Bob Loukas claimed via his Twitter account, Bitcoin is approaching a &apos;Bull trap target&apos;. Over the past two weeks, BTC&apos;s price moved relatively quickly from the low $30,000s after trading at that level since the market made a 50% correction during May 2021. Thus, the Fear and Greed Index flipped positive for the first time in that period, as investors expected further gains while Bitcoin moved into the low $40,000s.

They identified a bug – or rather, a part of the code that enabled them to transfer money to themselves – and acted on it. The developers didn’t intend to put in a “free money” button, but it was there ready to be exploited. And praise be it was: It’s one more mistake that (hopefully) won’t be repeated.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    ""I am not very interested in money! I know it hurts when people are attacked, but shouldn't they learn something from those attacks?"" the exploiter posted Wednesday in Ethereum blockchain data. At press time, approximately half of the stolen funds have been returned.      It’s not really my place to say whether they’re genuinely a “white hat” hacker or a black hat that realized it would be impossible to cash out. For what it’s worth, Tor Ekeland, an attorney who built a career out of defending computer miscreants, said: “Hacking is often more about the thrill of the hack than any object obtained in the hack.”      Hacks and exploits are not uncommon in the growing, multi-billion dollar decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, of which Poly Network was a part. Often the result of hastily designed scripts or deeper flaws in at the protocol level, attacks are also an important part of how any computer network grows more secure. That’s doubly true in the world of blockchain.      In fact, some would say hacks lead to unhackable code. It’s a controversial point, especially because hackers don’t always return the stolen funds, and undoubtedly people are harmed in the process.    Read more: An Extortion Gone Bad: Inside Binance’s Negotiations With Its ‘KYC Leaker’    “In the world of blockchain, when somebody deploys a smart contract – like on Ethereum – that has a vulnerability, hundreds of millions of dollars disappear overnight and there’s no recourse,” legendary former Google computer scientist and founder of Agoric, Mark Miller, said at a Foresight Institute conference in 2018. “There are these huge bug bounties, effectively. And when one of these things gets collected, the software with these vulnerabilities dies.”  In other words, blockchain-based systems face evolutionary pressure. Weak projects face “an early death” so the entire system becomes populated by secure code.      Blockchain technology has only been around for a little over a decade. DeFi, as we know it, is even younger. There’s a case to be made we’re just at the beginning stages of adoption, with many more mistakes likely along the way.      Hacks aren’t the only way for projects or protocols to evolve. People can build simple things slowly, as in the case of Bitcoin, which has only ever been down twice over its 12-year lifespan. There are external audits and a potential role for policy-makers or government regulators to play.      But searching for flaws in a codebase or finding exploiters after the fact is like “hunting the wolves,” Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, computer security specialist and brainchild behind Zcash, said in a direct message, borrowing a line from Vitalik Buterin.      He should know. In 2015, his auditing company, Least Authority, was hired by a group of devs to do a security audit of the soon-to-be-launched Ethereum network. Many of the vulnerabilities they found were fixed, but not the one having to do with “reentrancy,” which enabled people to deploy smart contracts that could be exploited.      Just years later that same vulnerability was exploited in “The DAO hack,” a $55 million headache that led to the contentious fork between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. At the time it filed its report, Least Authority even provided a hypothetical example of a smart contract that could be exploited: a crowd-funding smart contract, like The DAO.    Read more: The $55M Hack That Almost Brought Ethereum Down | Matthew Leising    As more money piles into smart contracts, it’s going to become harder and harder to “hunt the wolves” or individual exploiters. With hacks entire communities learn together what should and should not be repeated. Over time this leads to more “reliable” code. It’s one way to “armor the sheep.”      “If we as humans are going to rely on computers to do important things for us — and we are! — then we really require those programs to be unhackable. And despite the cynicism and despair among my fellow security experts, it is actually achievable!” Wilcox said.      “For every program like The DAO and Poly that got exploited because it had a vulnerability, you can point to another program that did the same thing but did not have that vulnerability.

42424740,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWGdh,1628786025,Ethereum Miners Make Multimillion-Dollar Bet on Upgrade Delay,"Major bitcoin mining firms and miner manufacturers are increasing their investments in ethereum mining despite the second network's impending switch to proof-of-stake.      Public bitcoin mining companies Hut 8 and Hive are increasing their capacities to mine the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. In the meantime, miner makers like Bitmain and Innosilicon are set to release new ethereum mining machines later this year.      This investment may seem strange, given that the Ethereum system is anticipated to migrate from proof-of-work (POW) to proof-of-stake (POS) in five months, and POS mining does not require such advanced machines. The rising demand might be attributed to expectations that the migration will be delayed, industry pros said.      “We were told mining was going to end four years ago and it is still going,” said Mark D’Aria, CEO of Bitpro, a New York-based consulting firm with a focus in brokerage and management of Ethereum mining hardware. “It has always been a wait-and-see approach – things tend to take longer than everyone expects.”      While last week’s London fork brings the network one step closer to Ethereum 2.0, significant upgrades throughout Ethereum’s six-year history have a track record of multiple delays.      For example, the Constantinople upgrade – which was a key step toward Ethereum 2.0 – was originally slated to launch as early as July 2018; however, a bug in its code delayed its deployment until February 2019, creating more delays for the migration.    Freezing mining with the Ice Age    Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 3554 introduced the difficulty bomb that adds artificial miners to increase mining difficulty, making mining operations less profitable. This period has been referred to as the “Ice Age.” Ethereum developers initially presented this EIP in 2015, but it has been postponed to December 2021.      As ether's price rises, it may become more difficult to transition the network to proof-of-stake, said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer of Seattle-based mining company Luxor.      “We have seen ether running up to $3,000, decentralized finance (DeFi) is built on top of the network and [non-fungible tokens] have taken off,” Vera said. “Even those that are bullish on Ethereum’s transition to POS still want to go slowly to make sure that things are being done correctly and there is not any potential doubt, pitfalls or blindspots that the developers are missing.”      Besides technical challenges and security issues for assets on Ethereum, potential resistance from the ethereum mining community could be another factor that slows the network’s migration to POS.      “One thing that has not been really appreciated is how much resistance there is going to be to that proof-of-stake migration,” D’Aria said. “To think that they are just going to flip a switch and turn off billions of dollars of miners, that’s crazy, that’s not going to happen.”    Institutional players    Ethereum mining has more individuals and fewer large-scale miners than bitcoin mining.      Relatively low energy consumption compared to bitcoin miners combined with the small amounts of heat and noise from ethereum mining rigs make it possible to mine ETH on graphic processing units (GPU) at home, Vera said.      More than 90% of ethereum mining machines are based on GPUs, which is also a common hardware used by gamers, D’Aria said.      However, crypto mining heavyweights are on the move to break into the industry and make profits that are bigger than they would be from bitcoin mining.      Public crypto mining company Hive Blockchain claimed it has become the largest public ethereum miner in the world with 3,383 gigahashes per second (GH/s), which was 1.3% of the total hashrate for the Ethereum network at the time, according to a financial report by Hive on Oct. 15, 2020.      The Vancouver-based company aims to raise its ethereum mining hashrate to 5,500 GH/s, which is a 62.5% increase compared to that level by the end of this year. Hive acquired a 50-megawatt (MW) data center in New Brunswick, Canada, from data center colocation services provider GPU One in February.      Another public crypto mining company, Hut 8, purchased $30 million worth of specialized Ethereum miners from GPU maker Nvidia in May. The company said all miners are expected to be delivered and installed into its Alberta facilities by the end of August. It plans to have 1,600 GH/s hashrate with a 4MW power usage.    “This transaction serves to strengthen Hut 8’s objective of increasing revenue diversification and to drive immediate short- and long-term revenue growth objectives forward in FY 2021,” the company saidhttps://hut8mining.com/faq-hut-8-expands-mining-capacity-with-30-million-usd-purchase-of-nvidia-cmps.    Unlike pure-play bitcoin mining companies such as Marathon and Riot, companies like Hut 8 have a mandate to utilize stranded or underutilized energy and turn that into compute power and reward, according to Vera.      “I think the companies that are going into ethereum mining right now this late in the game are looking at a bigger picture of how they can capitalize on their computing power,” Vera said. “Crypto is one vertical of many that they would pursue.”    Faster pay    More powerful ethereum miners, which shorten the payback period on such mining operations and increase profits, are coming to the market.      The specialized ethereum miners, also called application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), are designed by miner makers such as Bitmain specifically for mining, whereas most GPU miners are made by repurposing graphic cards for gaming.      Nvidia unveiled its first ethereum miner in early 2021, while Bitmain and Innosilicon are set to deliver their latest model to mine ethereum by the end of this year.      Miner manufacturer iPollo has raked in over $200 million in revenue from pre-orders of its latest model of ethereum ASICs, which will be delivered by the fourth quarter in 2021, said Paul Yao, vice president of global business development at iPollo. It aims to increase its production when the company reaches a higher capacity and is able to make miners all year round in 2022, according to Yao.      The Singapore-based company will set up an office in the U.S. in the coming year and shift its focus from the Chinese market to North America’s, “We are seeing growing demand in North America and some of the Asian markets,” Yao said.      “With an ASIC/GPU ROI (return of investment) of five to six months, and ETH 2.0 being very likely more than six months away, I can understand how most would accept the risk especially with prices looking strong,” said Azam Roslan, senior sales associate at Wattum, which is a New York-based crypto miner brokerage and management company.      Vera estimated the payback period for Ethereum mining could be as short as four months if miners use the latest generation of ASICs. “For bitcoin mining, depending on the price they are paying for the operations, the public companies are looking at a year’s time frame for payback,” Vera said.      By comparison, some of the existing GPU cards for ethereum mining, such as the 3070 GPU card produced by Nvidia, still need about 18 months for the miners to cover all their costs, Arseni Grusha, Wattum’s CEO said.      “You want the payback period to stay under 12 months, meaning that either ETH goes up in value or the GPU prices have to go down,” Grusha said. “GPU prices are not expected to go down, and even if ETH goes to $4,000, it would have to stay there for ETH mining ROI to be attractive.”    Profit margins    A strong market price and relatively low operating costs are among the main reasons that Ethereum mining has been generating more profits than bitcoin mining since last year.      While the London fork has enabled the Ethereum network to burn a portion of the gas fee that would otherwise be paid to miners, Ethereum mining appears to be even more profitable since the fork thanks to Ethereum’s price.      Daily miner revenue in U.S. dollars has rather increased by 7.1% and hit a two-month high, according to data from Coin Metrics. The network has burned about 33% of the new coin supply growth since the update, which is 22,708 ETH and worth $76.1 million.      Besides priority fees (gas fee minus the base fee burnt), block subsidies (similar to Bitcoin block awards) and maximal extractable value (MEV) are the other two sources of revenue for miners. MEV is the amount of money an ethereum miner can make by helping traders to insert, leave out or reorder transactions in a block.      “After EIP 1559, we are still getting the MEV, 2 ETH from block subsidies and quite a bit of the gas given from some of the wallets,” D’Aria said. “So it is really not that big of a deal.”      Miners are already expecting gas fees to go down in the long run as more scaling solutions on Ethereum roll out, which will reduce congestion and transaction fees, D’Aria said.      DeFi saw explosive growth last summer due to a new reward mechanism for investors that use DeFi protocols, where they can earn new tokens beyond the returns on deposits. More trading activities across various protocols on Ethereum has drastically increased transaction fees, which is paid to miners for their work to validate transactions.      “You get two ETHs from the block subsidies and five to seven more from the fees,” D’Aria said of the high transaction fees during the DeFi boom. However, with lower transaction volumes on DeFi, gas fees have declined for Ethereum miners. “That was an anomaly and miners feel like enjoying it while it lasts.”      Ethereum mining tends to have low operating costs compared to bitcoin mining. While GPU miners are expensive and it is more labor-intensive to run the machines, low power consumption could make up those costs and reduce the overall cost even lower than bitcoin mining, Vera said.      The exact date of Ethereum’s historic migration to POS is anyone’s guess but a well-timed investment in Ethereum mining could make a big profit, Vera says.      “The miners who betted against proof-of-stake two years ago made an absolute killing,” Vera said. “If you can bet against that, the return could be quite lucrative.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/12/ethereum-miners-make-multimillion-dollar-bet-on-upgrade-delay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa29c046ffdb2b11112893e1990952d798f21376-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376364,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AJR3,1628784936,Pelosi Ally Asks US House Speaker to Modify Crypto Language in Infrastructure Bill,"U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to amend the crypto tax provision in the Senate's infrastructure bill in an open letter on Thursday.      Eshoo, described by Politico in 2014 as ""Pelosi’s closest friend in Congress,"" wrote that the current definition of the term ""broker"" for crypto tax reporting purposes is too broad and may be difficult for some entities to comply with.      ""When the House takes up the Senate bill, I encourage you to amend the problematic broker definition in Section 80603 of the legislation,"" the letter said.      Eshoo joins a growing group of bipartisan lawmakers pushing back against the crypto provision. House Financial Services Committee Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and a handful of other congressmen on both sides of the political aisle have expressed their support for changing the language.      The infrastructure bill, a priority for U.S. President Joe Biden, will fund $1 trillion in infrastructure improvements or new initiatives around the country, such as passenger rail and electric vehicle charging. Some $550 billion of this will come from new spending, including ""pay-fors,"" measures meant to raise funds to pay for the initiatives in the bill.      Under the current terms of the provision, any entity that facilitates a crypto transaction on behalf of another person would be treated as a broker, meaning the entity would have to file specific tax information reports that would include know-your-customer details. However, industry proponents are concerned this would include miners or other network validators and hardware developers, who don't typically have access to this sort of information.      Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) proposed an amendment to narrow the scope of the language, while the provision's original author, Senator Rob Portman, (R-Ohio) as well as Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) introduced a different amendment. Ultimately, the Senate proceeded without considering any amendments, leading to the majority of the group introducing a compromise amendment that was blocked under Senate procedural rules.      Eshoo endorsed the compromise amendment in her letter on Thursday.      ""I share the goals of the underlying provision to address tax evasion in the cryptocurrency market, but the House should amend it, as the bipartisan compromise amendment would have, to meet this goal without stifling innovation in a nascent industry by imposing unworkable regulations,"" Eshoo wrote.      The Senate passed the infrastructure bill on Tuesday.

But the round wasn’t entirely funded by venture capital.      Tally’s co-founder and CEO, Dennison Bertram, told CoinDesk that approximately 25% of the funding came from DAOs themselves including The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures and Fire Eyes DAO, as well as DAO-affiliated angel investors, including Ryan Sean Adams, the founder of Bankless.      DAOs – which Tally CTO and co-founder Rafael Solari describes as essentially a “group chat with a bank account” – are exploding in popularity as decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to gain momentum.      DAO members band together, share assets and make decisions as a group, which can look like anything from a decentralized company with revenue and payroll and products, to a group of people pooling money together to buy a CryptoPunk.

Tally’s platform offers DAOs voting structure and analytics, member transparency and governance tools. The software is already used by protocols including Gitcoin, FEI and Ampleforth as the primary DAO interface.      ""We believe that DAOs have the potential to be more scalable and more equitable than corporations,” Aleks Larsen, partner at Blockchain Capital, said in a press statement. “The Tally team has helped the oldest and largest DAOs solve critical governance and operational problems and is the partner of choice for new DAOs.""

42376375,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AJcN,1628777807,"To Win in Washington, Crypto Needs a Campaign Strategy","With the infrastructure bill set to adopt an excessively broad legislation against crypto, many in the community have begun to realize the importance of engaging in the legislative process. Sentiment has shifted among key community figures who recognize the need for a larger effort to ensure an optimal regulatory and legislative crypto environment.      Think tanks and advocacy groups such as Coin Center that have done phenomenal work to help educate and engage with policy makers. However, there is only so much these organizations can do in engaging directly with policymakers. Getting their full support ultimately requires the support of voters.    Angus Champion de Crespigny is the outgoing CTO for C|T Group, the campaigns, research and advisory firm founded by Sir Lynton Crosby AO, where he led the firm’s digitization of campaigns and research. Previously, Angus was EY’s Financial Services Blockchain Leader from 2015 to 2018.    Money is certainly needed in this process. However, it is not just a matter of putting up billboards or buying advertisements. Without a plan or strategy, you’re likely to spend a lot to run in many directions without measurable impact. The crypto industry needs a campaign mindset.    The missing piece of crypto advocacy    When people hear about campaigns, they typically think of elections. The science of election campaigning has been refined over decades to achieve a desired outcome in a highly adversarial environment. We can use this same approach whenever public support is required for a particular issue – be it for political or commercial reasons – and this is what the most effective advocacy organizations do.      A comprehensive campaign strategy is multifaceted and requires considerable research. There are, however, a few general principles to demonstrate what an effective campaign is, and what people often get wrong. We’ll start with the latter.    Common errors    Mistaking action for impact. Putting up a billboard is an action. A viral tweet is an action. Getting an article published or an interview on a podcast may be promising actions, but they are meaningless if they have no impact.      Your message has an intended audience, whether it is a customer, policymaker or voter. Did the message resonate with them? Did they even see it? Or is your PR strategy more accurately described as “spray and pray?"" Every action should be driven by an intended impact that can be assessed. If you cannot measure the behavioral change your action triggers, you should consider whether it’s worth the effort.      Trusting vanity metrics. You got 10,000 shares on your blog, multiple Clubhouse appearances, and your article had one million views. Your engagement is through the roof. But there seems to be little impact you actually want it. The general public doesn’t seem to care any more about crypto, and representatives in Congress certainly don’t. What gives?      Vanity metrics are the metrics that look good but carry little value in themselves. Shares, tweets, likes and impressions show how people are engaging with your content, but they do not show impact or behavioral change. There are multiple examples of politicians dominating in social media metrics, but failing at the polls. As the saying goes, Twitter is not real life.      The wrong message, or simply too many of them. This is the area that I believe the crypto community most consistently gets wrong. The wrong way to persuade people is to try to convince them that what matters to you should matter to them. What you believe to be the most important aspects of crypto is not necessarily going to be what is considered valuable by others.      If the average person cared about hard money, they would hold gold. If they cared about decentralization, they would have been using Tor and BitTorrent for years. Yet these are regularly touted as the benefits of these products to ""no-coiners"" to increase adoption. That is not to say that these things are not important, but something being important and your target audience believing it to be sufficiently important for them to take action are different things.    Read more: There’s Still Time to Fix Congress’s Crypto-Tax Mess | David Z. Morris    A related mistake is having too many messages. It is far better to have one strong message and repeat it ad infinitum than to have many messages to please everyone. How often have we heard someone say about a politician “I don’t know what they stand for”?    Influence, the right way    If we’re using the wrong message, how do we identify the right one? If we shouldn’t use vanity metrics, how do we measure impact?      As with any science, the answer is research. Every campaign requires a comprehensive strategy, and at each stage of that strategy, we require comprehensive research to ensure we focus on our desired outcome. While the strategies can vary, there are three general stages that work together in all effective campaigns.      Identify the decision makers for the outcome you want. For an election, the decision makers are usually the swing voters in marginal electorates. This is why you rarely see Democratic or Republican presidential candidates campaigning in California or Idaho: the former will always vote Democrat, the latter always Republican. For any issue, there is a desired outcome – getting a bill passed, entering a market, getting a product sold – and for any particular outcome, there are those who will always be supportive, those who will always be against, and the swing. Your research at this stage should be identifying these different groups and the impact they will have on your desired outcome.      The particular research you conduct will depend on your goal. For political campaigns, voter registrations and historical voting records by demographic can be helpful. If you have target groups in mind, surveys and scientifically robust polls can give you the information you need. Ultimately, the more accurately you can categorize your audiences into supporters, opponents and the undecided, the more effectively you can target them.      Define the message based on the decision maker’s values. When you know your target audience, you can start to elicit their values through further, detailed research. What is important to them? What do they value most? How does crypto help them in their pursuit of those values? The goal is to understand not just what people are saying but what their values truly are, and then crafting a concise message to which they will pay attention.      Understanding these values and defining a strong message typically requires an iterative process made up of activities such as polling and focus groups. Done well, a message can stand out and speak directly to your target audience’s values, turning individuals from disinterested parties into active supporters.      Communicate to the decision makers and measure your impact. This is where the memes, the press releases, the tweets come in. Effectiveness here is defined by how well you reach who you want to reach. Are you using the right platforms? Are you presenting the message in a way your target audience digests information? And most importantly, how do you know it is having an impact with the decision makers?      Identifying the optimal communication channels will depend on the target audience and the topic. Some of this you can determine in advance: Facebook, for example, is a necessity for any online campaign due to its dominant market position. In other cases, direct emails and text messages can be the best way to motivate.      Remember that impact is not measured by vanity metrics, but by behavioral change: Throughout this process, you need to measure your success in achieving that, and adjusting as necessary. Success may be determined by the rate of click-throughs from your advertisements that result in a petition signing, or the number of people signed up to an advocacy network. As the campaign develops, monitoring what channels are most successful and maximizing them will be critical.    Time to mature    If the crypto industry wants to truly effect change, it needs to nurture its infrastructure for doing so. Activist change does not come about solely from tweeting, meme-ing, or trying to educate about the technology, although these can play a part. Activist change comes from a campaign strategy based on comprehensive research that identifies the right decision makers for each issue, elicits their values and speaks to them in messages they understand.      We have the motivation and ability to build support, so it is worth doing it properly. After all, effective campaigns can change the world.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | RESEARCH,Angus Champion de Crespigny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/12/to-win-in-washington-crypto-needs-a-campaign-strategy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf192b7154b94668a6a84c502eb2c91b2fa94d6e-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421054,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBLQ5,1628773200,"Living in Puerto Rico, Where the Taxes Are Low and Crypto Thrives","Andrew Keys’ last half-hour reverse commute from Manhattan to ConsenSys’ office in Brooklyn, N.Y., was a meditative experience. The founding father of the Ethereum blockchain daydreamed ways blockchain could improve the world, from digitizing money to decentralizing the web, before stepping out of a subway car into a gray winter morning. He much prefers dialing in from a tropical paradise.  Keys moved to Puerto Rico in January 2018, the height of the previous crypto bull market. He was part of a wave of early crypto adopters looking to take advantage of the island’s generous tax incentives. It was a trend that once symbolized the excesses of the blockchain industry, which settled down during the bear market but is now roaring back.  The reason is as clear as the island waters: Puerto Rico is a tax haven. That’s true for everyone, but the island’s hands-off approach to capital gains, income and business taxes is just what pro-capitalist, state skeptics look for in a residence. Call it simpatico with crypto, with the bonus of getting to keep your U.S. passport.  “Puerto Rico is awesome,” Keys said. “It's a beautiful Caribbean island. It's safe. It has what I would consider one of the most entrepreneurial-minded communities that are building all sorts of different businesses.” (After leaving ConsenSys, in 2019, he joined risk management firm DARMA Capital, which has a base on the island.)  One element that defines the latest crush of crypto-native emigres to the island is the insistence that the move means business. Pantera, one of the most watched hedge funds in crypto, have relocated to San Juan. So have CoinMint, a large bitcoin miner, SuperRare, a well-established non-fungible token (NFT) platform, and legendary crypto power couple Amanda and Sam Cassatt, ConsenSys alums turned marketing guru and venture capitalist, respectively.  There are money men, freelance coders and those trying their hand at the ultra-modern business of ETH staking. Coral DeFi, an investment management platform, Dex Grid, a decentralized energy startup, and the BarnBridge decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol were all spun up from the go in Puerto Rico.  And they’re more than welcome. In 2012, Puerto Rico passed two laws, Act 20 and Act 22, meant to court entrepreneurs and corporations. Act 20 set a 4% tax for businesses that export services – say blockchain consultancy – from the island.  But Act 22 is the real draw. Though it is officially a part of the U.S., the island has cordoned itself off from the mainland’s tax code and exempts residents from taxes on capital gains. That makes it the only place on U.S. soil where income from investments, interest and dividends is untaxed. All you have to do is spend 183 days per year on an island known for its pearl-white beaches and dark rums (residing on a boat within territorial waters also works).  “I wouldn’t call it a loophole,” Shehan Chandrasekera, a CPA and co-founder of Column Tax, said. “I don't think it's a hidden thing. Puerto Rico and other tax havens, those are pretty commonly talked about among the high-net-worth individual community.”  Read more: The Bitcoiners Who Live ‘Permanently Not There’  Plenty of jurisdictions – many of them tropical paradises – compete for treasure by offering low or no taxes. Some, like El Salvador, are directly appealing to the bitcoin community. But only Puerto Rico, which is closer to Caracas than it is to Miami, offers residents an easy way to keep their U.S. citizenship.  That doesn’t mean you’re likely to find suits wandering the sandy shores – it is crypto after all. Even when Keys was taking the L train, he was wearing jeans and tee shirt. But the new crush of immigration is self-consciously more corporate-oriented than the last, if only as a reaction to previous criticism of trying to set up the unincorporated U.S. commonwealth as a “blockchain island.”  Puertopia, forever  In 2017, former child star and presidential candidate Brock Pierce introduced the world to both the smart contract platform EOS and the idea for a crypto homestead called “Puertopia.” The latter plans drew major media attention, and for good reason. Pierce and his cadre purchased hotels, churches and even a defunct children’s hospital to house their crypto sandbox. There were plans to incorporate a city.  Although the rich have long exploited Puerto Rico’s ready-made tax avoidance setup, it was Pierce who really brought the concept to crypto. “Brock is still number one, just the amount of people he has in his network, the amount of traveling he does and the influence that he has in the community,” Pedro Rivera, founder of Crypto Mondays in San Juan, said over the phone.  In exchange for paying very little in taxes, these crypteau-riche men (mostly men, at least) would reinvest their capital in Puerto Rico. That’s always been the implicit goal of any business-friendly tax policy, and with Pierce, it became an explicit promise. And it was made all the more real in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island’s already fragile economy and infrastructure.  Pierce, who has promised to donate his multibillion-dollar fortune in part to support his chosen homeland, launched rebuilding efforts in real life and on-chain. It’s hard to judge the impact of that work. Real money was spent, but it wasn’t quite the renaissance as advertised. (Pierce did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.)  Of course, the severe market downturn (and later global pandemic) derailed many of the wildest plans to build back up. But it was never clear precisely what reinventing Puerto Rico’s digital economy meant. Or if it was wanted.  “People don’t have light, electricity, the internet ... their roofs are leaking,” Rivera, who emigrated from the Bronx in 2017, said. “They don’t care about crypto, bro.”  If there was any tangible effect crypto’s wealth has had on the island’s recovery efforts, it was likely made at the individual level or was too local to be noticed, he said. For his part, Rivera said he helped raise $27,000 to fund roof work at Poet’s Passage, a local landmark where he holds weekly crypto meetups. Recently, he closed a $100,000 funding round backed by the Crypto Monday's community and intends to give away wallets preloaded with $10 in crypto to thousands of kids of the Boys & Girls Clubs. (The charity was not involved in this process and has not yet endorsed the idea.)  “I've had a bunch of Puerto Ricans that have made money in crypto by investing in it,” he said. But in terms of crypto companies creating high-paying jobs for locals? “We haven't been able to really make that flourish just yet,” he said.  Read more: Puerto Rico-Based FV Bank to Offer Regulated Crypto Custody in the US  For some, the vaporware, the tax dodge, the monastery-to-boutique-hotel pipeline all adds up to one thing: exploitation. Canadian leftist intellectual and author Naomi Klein looked at the situation and called it “crypto colonialism”; Jillian Crandall, a researcher at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, called it a perverse form of “disaster capitalism.” CoinDesk published a report that asked if Puerto Rico could survive the “eternal boy playground,” the rough Latin translation of “Puertopia.”  “If it weren’t for the fact that Puerto Rico is a U.S. commonwealth, the [Puertopia] venture would seem exactly like colonialism – the policy or practice of acquiring full or partial political control over another country, occupying it with settlers and exploiting it economically. Wait, no, actually it’s still colonialism,” CoinDesk’s Bailey Reutzel wrote in 2018.  It’s a legacy that’s hard to outrun.  Making a blockchain island  It was the fourth week of Keiko Yoshino’s one-week Caribbean vacation last winter before she realized she didn’t want to leave. She flew back to Washington, D.C., where she was working in the public sector, to pack her belongings and tie up loose ends. She arrived back in San Juan with two suitcases and a new title: executive director of the Blockchain Trade Association in Puerto Rico.  “If you asked me in December, I would have been like, ‘bitcoin, that's like the imaginary money, right?’” she said. But in Puerto Rico, it clicked. Everything clicked. She fell in love with the technology and the island. “It's a vibe. It's the energy. … It's like falling through the looking glass,” she said. “It's very different here. Different values, different priorities.”  Yoshino isn’t your usual suspect when thinking about crypto and Puerto Rico. She’s not a crypto-bro, she’s not crypto-rich and she’s not looking to start an anarcho-capitalist collective. She helped found the blockchain association to support the local crypto community and put her years of government experience to work. It pays the bills, but she's not getting rich.  But that doesn’t stop people from attacking her. “I was on social media earlier: They misspelled my name, they called me a crypto colonizer,” she said. As a relative newcomer to the industry, she finds the idea that blockchain startups are malevolent usurpers is as laughable as the idea that they’re going to revolutionize the island anytime soon.  “It’s disconnected from reality,” she said. Her day job has her organizing a conference this winter. On the weekends, she plays volleyball. She mentioned an association member, Raincoat, an insurance firm that is using blockchain technology to help disburse insurance payments after hurricanes. From her perspective, the tax incentive program has largely helped the country, but not everyone agrees.  “It's kind of sickening how the corporations that are there to take advantage of the 4% export tax do absolutely nothing to improve the local economy,” a crypto trader who goes by ""PVKT"" on Reddit and asked to remain pseudonymous said. He moved there in 2019, primarily for the tax benefits, before repatriating. Living in a resort town two years after Maria, he faced roaming blackouts that were “not very conducive to trading.”  Then there was the abject poverty on view – the concrete houses, the crumbling infrastructure, the lack of water or basic utilities. It was hard to square his lifestyle, and those around him, with the experience of local people. “You trade a lot for the incentives. If money is your only concern and nothing else, then it might fit the bill,” PVKT said.  JSON, a pseudonymous Twitter user, was also planning to move to Puerto Rico before he stared down a similar moral quandary. “When I look deeper into it, there's a lot that is less than desirable. ... Wealthy people move there but do little to contribute to the local economy. The people there are so nice, but some feel taken advantage of,” he said.  To the extent that there is a crypto community in Puerto Rico, it has likely developed because of the proximity principle. Most of the crypto expats I spoke to lived in the same few neighborhoods in San Juan or Dorado, a wealthy coastal enclave. There are world-class restaurants nearby where the hosts speak English and private schools to send your kids.  “What happens is you have a high concentration of these people in small areas,” Rivera said. Although he lives in a neighborhood that’s primarily Spanish speaking, he prefers to socialize with the upper class. “So what happens is we all go to the same places. There are not that many high-end places in Puerto Rico.”  Read more: Central Bank of Bahamas Launches Landmark ‘Sand Dollar’ Digital Currency  That’s not necessarily a bad thing – although the rich may escape paying capital gains taxes, they still contribute to the state. Keys noted he pays corporate income tax, property taxes, sales tax. “There's infinite taxes that people still will have to pay. Albeit potentially lower,” he said.  At times, the expats have faced more pressure for their decision to move to Puerto Rico than taking a gamble on decentralized internet money. But in some sense, moving abroad to escape one’s tax burden is similar to plugging out from the current monetary system through crypto. Both are ways to outrun the state, and attempt to build an alternative system.  “No one's going to pay all those taxes,” Rivera said of the comparatively high tax bill he was staring down if he had stayed in The Bronx. “If you have an opportunity to not pay, it's not like our government needs the money, bro. They can print out money whenever they want.”  UPDATE (18 Aug., 2021 21:10 UTC): Adds that the Boys & Girls Clubs of America was not involved in a plan to give away donated crypto wallets.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/12/living-in-puerto-rico-where-the-taxes-are-low-and-crypto-thrives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5eaf0c42c5b0224a93d5713fadca7a6a0907aa1-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The latest refund progress was confirmed by Poly Network on Twitter Thursday, although a full recovery of the refunds will still require the attacker to give the final key for the multisig wallet.  The DeFi platform, which operates on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum and Polygon, was hit by a hack that drained over $600 million in crypto earlier this week.  The hacker began returning the funds on Tuesday to wallet addresses across the three chains.  While it remains a question as to whether the attacker is a true ""white-hat"" hacker, Poly, which called the attacker ""Mr. White Hat,"" offered $500,000 worth of tokens to him or her as a ""legal bounty reward"" on Thursday.  The attacker, who acknowledged the offer, said he or she never responded to Poly about it and will send all of the money back.  Shixing ""Discus Fish"" Mao, CEO and co-founder of mining pool F2Pool, said in a Weibo post that the negotiation of the refund took about 52 hours and included the participation of several parties including himself, a white-hat hacker named ""MR. 600 MILLION,"" security firm Slowmist and Tether.  Slowmist told CoinDesk on Friday that not long after the attack, the company was able to obtain internet protocol addresses (IP) and email addresses associated with the hacker, which may have put some pressure on the hacker to return the funds.  Mao said that he will build a monument in Cryptovoxels, a virtual world on Ethereum, to commemorate the ""historic"" event, which he said has accelerated the development of security in the crypto industry.

The crypto is currently changing hands for around $45,000 after reaching a 24-hour top of $46,767, CoinDesk data shows. The temporary stay in price might be short-lived, however, as prices begin toying with major psychological resistance near $50,000, according to some.      ""The derivatives markets are long, perpetual funding rates are positive for shorts, indicating short-term positive interest from retail,"" Toby Chapple, head of trading at digital asset firm Zerocap, told CoinDesk via Telegram.      On the institutional side, things look slightly different, according to Chapple, who said calendar futures across both bitcoin and ether were ""fairly compressed"" pointing toward open interest growing for short positions.      Bitcoin is up 50% over a three-week period, having broken a long-term moving average on the back of strong institutional and retail demand. Still, the crypto is showing signs of buyer exhaustion as seen by the relative strength index, an indicator used to gauge a given trend.      ""Markets need to digest some overbought levels before attempting $50,000-$55,000 resistance,"" Chapple said.      And while bitcoin's rally on the back of Ethereum's ""London"" Hard Fork has helped drive prices, political tensions in the U.S. and China's crackdown remain a ""significant threat"" to the crypto market, Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk via WhatsApp on Thursday.

Key to the crypto industry, the plan calls for more legislation on tech industries and the environment, intensifying law enforcement in finance and ecological management, as well as the ""healthy development"" of new business models in digital industries.  Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency reported the development on Wednesday.  China, once the world's largest bitcoin mining hub, has been cracking down on crypto mining because of environmental and financial concerns. Miners are moving their operations overseas, primarily to central Asia.  But Beijing's push to rein in tech industries goes far beyond crypto, and has led global investors to reconsider their exposure to China.  Share prices for Chinese tech giants like Tencent and Alibaba have been tumbling, and SoftBank is holding back on investing in the country.  The plan also calls for a nationwide unified law enforcement system using internet and big data: Chinese local authorities have been experimenting with the use of consortium blockchains to integrate government data, including in the field of law enforcement.

Delta claims that its ""Enhanced Yield Product"" will simplify the process of bitcoin and ether options trading, according to a press release Delta Exchange shared with CoinDesk on Thursday,      Options allow traders to buy or sell a security at a specified strike price before or on a given date. The strike price in derivatives market terms is a set price at which the owner of the option can buy or sell the underlying asset, in this case, bitcoin or ether.      Singapore-based Delta Exchange said in the same way exchange-traded funds simplify crypto exposure, investors won't need to learn or experiment with complex options strategies as they can select from a menu as they see fit.      “This product is focused on helping investors participate in more complex options strategies without having to execute them,"" Delta CEO Pankaj Balani said. ""It is focused on generating high yields with passive management.”      If the price of an asset is greater than the strike of the option being shorted, then a user's bitcoin is sold automatically at the strike price, allowing the user to pocket the difference.      Conversely, when a user's option contract expires and the price of bitcoin is less than the strike price, the automated strategy doesn't sell the asset and the client retains his or her bitcoin. That allows users to avoid high-risk situations and results in earnings, the exchange said.      ""As the options markets continue to mature, we believe structured products will become a viable option for all traders,"" Balani said.

The emergence of new secondary markets for digital property assets might mean more liquidity, efficiency and lower costs for investors, the report noted.  “Tokenization has potential to drive down transactional costs and improve efficiency via the use of ‘smart contracts’ which can replace copious paperwork and laborious administration,” according to the report.  Institutional investors still largely remain on the sidelines waiting for more regulatory clarity, the report said.  Moore Global is the parent company of Moore Cayman, an auditing firm that published attestation reports for Tether, issuer of the largest stablecoin, USDT.  “From an audit perspective, adding digital assets to a portfolio can be advantageous as blockchain technology can make transactions more transparent and trackable,” David Walker, a managing partner at Moore Cayman, wrote in the report.  Texas-based commercial real estate marketplace Red Swan had tokenized $2.2 billion in real estate through security token platform Polymath, and it had another $4 billion in properties in the tokenization pipeline, CoinDesk reported in February 2020.

42397086,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYcb6,1628727327,Solana’s Mango Markets DEX Raises $70M in MNGO Token Sale,"Mango Markets, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the high-speed Solana blockchain, raised $70 million in a token sale Wednesday.      At its height, investors had plowed over $500 million in USDC into the trading platform’s 24-hour sale, racing to get a share of 500 million MNGO tokens up for grabs. But much of that drained away in the final minutes of a daylong grace period that followed, leaving $70.5 million locked up in tokens.      The funding for the still-nascent project reflects the rising fortunes of the Solana blockchain. Many decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols aim to raise between $1 million and $15 million in seed stage funding, one source said, making Mango DAO’s (decentralized autonomous organization) $70 million an outlier.      Mango offers a trading hub for spot markets, perpetual futures and lending. It sources liquidity from its own pools as well as from Serum, an exchange built on the Solana blockchain.      The sale was closed to U.S. investors, likely in an attempt to stave off the regulatory scrutiny that can hamstring similar projects – sometimes years down the line.      The DAO’s website said MNGO has three goals, including to capitalize an insurance fund, distribute the DEX governance token and incentivize liquidity for market makers. Ninety percent of tokens are locked up in a governance fund, 5% in an insurance policy and the remainder in contributor tokens.    Read more: Solana Labs Raises $314M in Token Sale Led by A16z, Polychain    The entirety of Wednesday’s funding will go to DAO’s insurance fund to secure a hefty backstop for Mango Protocol’s lenders if things go south, sources familiar with the funding round told CoinDesk. Hacks happen in the Wild West of decentralization, and Mango DAO cautioned token buyers that it couldn't guarantee its smart contracts would be bug-free. (The sale took place against the backdrop of Tuesday’s $600 million heist on Poly Network, another DeFi platform.)      Solana Labs, the leading firm behind the network, raised $314 million in June. Solana itself has been the blockchain of choice for Sam Bankman-Fried, the billionaire who founded the FTX crypto exchange and who has invested heavily in Solana-based projects.

Bulls Now “In Control” Over Every Bitcoin Timeframe,"Bitcoin price is back at $46,000 after a few month reset back to $30,000 and slightly below. A more than 50% collapse from the current all-time high of $65,000 had the cryptocurrency community calling for a bear market, but according to a trend strength indicator, bears are nowhere in sight. In fact, the tool, called the Average Directional Index suggests that bulls are now back in control over Bitcoin price action on every major timeframe. Bitcoin Ready For Final Push According To ADX Indicator Bitcoin is an unusually bullish asset that has only truly known a secular bull market despite the recurring 80 to 90% drawdowns that end each cycle. These so-called &apos;bear markets&apos; barely turn technical indicators bearish, and result in new highs less than four years later. Instead of a bear market, these phases could better be described as a return to mean after a bubble phase - a bubble phase that hasn&apos;t yet completed, according to a trend-strength measuring tool.
