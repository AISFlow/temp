42426449,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcxxh,1437775838,Blockchain Hackathon Heads to India's Bombay Stock Exchange,"Multinational technology firm IBM is among the partners of a forthcoming India-based hackathon set to focus on bitcoin, the blockchain and FinTech.  Called HackCoin, the two-day event is scheduled for 1st and 2nd August at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Presented by Zone Startups and local bitcoin advocate Raunaq Vaisoha, the event will engage participants on themes including Big Data, payments and the digital experience.  The aim, according to event press materials, is to introduce more developers to the bitcoin and wider blockchain ecosystem, as well as the available APIs from major providers.  Benson Samuel, CTO of Coinsecure, explained that HackCoin's choice of venue proved key to its ability to attract sponsors. Notably, Zone Startups is formally affiliated with the BSE Institute, a subsidiary of the parent stock exchange.  Vaisoha told CoinDesk:  ""More and more venture capitalists are seeing the opportunity of investing in the early infrastructure of bitcoin, however, despite the large interest, more applications still need to be built around it. We’re excited for the outcome of HackCoin.""  HackCoin is seeking participants well-versed in PHP, Python and SHA, as well as more general skill sets such as HTML and entrepreneurship. Prizes will include a variety of gift packages, as well as pitch opportunities for the event's most compelling projects.  IBM has previously explored blockchain technologies as part of its Internet of Things (IoT) program. First revealed in January, ADEPT leveraged smart contracts provided by Ethereum and the bitcoin blockchain to envision systems by which smart appliances might be able to be more efficient.  Additional sponsors for the event include India-based bitcoin wallet provider Zebpay and digital payments specialist Citrus.

42426436,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcxdh,1437774364,Gallup Poll Finds Few Consumers Trust Digital Wallets,"Few consumers are using digital wallets – just 2% according to recent data from Gallup – and those who don't say concerns about security are the reason.  Despite enthusiasm among financial tech observers and investors for digital wallets, it seems few users are enthused. Other studies suggest that while many consumers have heard about mobile wallets, overall adoption is low.  New data released by Gallup adds to this canon, finding little interest for digital wallets – software that ostensibly enables easier payment via electronic means. Why? Fifty-five percent of those who don't use digital wallets cite a lack of trust in security as a major concern. Another subset – 21% – say they don't know enough about the products.  This lack of trust extends further to the platforms on which the digital wallets are accessed. Just 19% of respondents told Gallup that they ""have a lot of trust in their cellphone platforms"", with only 15% saying they ""have a lot of trust in their cellphone carrier"".  Even those who have a degree of faith in their mobile phone from a security perspective feel they would likely never use a digital wallet.  As Gallup noted:  ""Only 4% of these trusting smartphone users say they are extremely likely to start using a digital wallet in the next 12 months. Conversely, 53% of them say they are extremely unlikely to start using a digital wallet.""  What does this have to do with bitcoin? Nothing on the surface given that Gallup didn't ask respondents how they felt about bitcoin wallets.  But if and when bitcoin wallets become more ubiquitous, these same concerns could come into play as startups pitch bitcoin wallets to the wider public.

42426439,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcxhh,1437755688,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Blockchain Drumbeat Grows Louder,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of bitcoin media coverage and its impact.  Despite setting off to a rather boring start, excitement peaked this week when reports surfaced that two former bitcoin exchange operators had been arrested on anti-money laundering (AML) charges in the US.  Elsewhere, bitcoin enthusiasts were yet again confronted with the everlasting – and ever-boring – “chicken and egg” debate regarding the technology's expected advancement.  Unlike last week, however, where mentions of the technology by financial bigwigs and political figures went largely unnoticed, the last few days have been characterized by media validation of ""blockchain technology"", often at the expense of clarity on the complexities surrounding the term.  The sheer amount of coverage, however, seems to once again be affected by a case of Summer doldrums.  Bitcoin takes a backseat  It's not the first time that bitcoin has seen its reputation suffer as a result of its association with business owners who have been accused of illegal activities. Yet, this week found bitcoin taking the backseat in a high-profile case as major publications omitted prominent mentions of the technology from coverage.  Fusion’s Rob Wile  explained how in 2014 hackers had gained access to customer information of tens of millions of JP Morgan accountholders.  Why is this relevant? Well, it turns out that authorities in Israel and the US arrested four individuals believed to be connected to the hack earlier this week. “Two of them allegedly ran an illicit bitcoin exchange.”  As reported by CoinDesk  , the US Attorney’s Office of Southern District of Manhattan stated that Murgio and Lebedev – the exchange’s former operators – were charged with breaking AML laws by not running know-your-customer (KYC) checks on customers. The pair were also accused of being connected to bitcoin ransomware attacks.  The news caught the attention of the The Wall Street Journal, but it omitted the bitcoin mention from its headline and subsequently buried it into the article, writing:  “The men were charged in a Manhattan federal court Tuesday. Three were accused of running a pump-and-dump scheme to manipulate stock prices, while the other two were accused of operating an illegal bitcoin operation.”  Bitcoin, however, reentered the spotlight in a piece by the Washington Post titled “Why the Justice Department is going after this Bitcoin exchange”.  “The Justice Department has arrested and charged two men in an 'underground' bitcoin exchange that allegedly helped tens of thousands of clients convert nearly $2m worth of the anonymous digital currency – illegally.”  The mixed approach, however, may suggest some fatigue in the idea that bitcoin's association with criminal activities somehow separates it from other payments technologies.  Bitcoin’s plumbing  Bitcoin, blockchain or both?  The media is still struggling with how to frame developments in the industry given that more enterprise institutions are expressing an interest in the capabilities of decentralized ledgers, often using the term ""blockchain"" to voice this enthusiasm.  At issue is that often these ""blockchain projects"" use the bitcoin blockchain, which necessitates the use of bitcoin the currency or some other mediating digital token such as those offered by Counterparty and Factom to access the ledger.  Such nuances are often lost in coverage, suffering from the lack of consensus on definitions for concepts relating to the early-stage technology.  Reuters’ Jemima Kelly wrote a piece with “Betting on blockchain: firm seek fortune in bitcoin’s plumbing” as its headline.  Kelly wrote:  “A year ago, bitcoin was widely dismissed as little more than a way for drug dealers and terrorists to move money around anonymously. Now, some of the world’s biggest banks and companies are buying into the technology behind it.”  She continued: “Underlying the controversial web-based ‘cryptocurrency’ is the blockchain – a massive ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made that is verified and shared by a global network of computers.”  Kelly went on to note the endless possibilities offered by blockchain technology.  “But the data that can be secured by the blockchain is not restricted to bitcoin transactions,” she said, adding: “Any two parties could use it to exchange other information, including stock deals, legal contracts and property records, within minutes and with no need for a third party to verify it.”  Still, the press has shown an increasing willingness to favor a more general definition of ""blockchain"" even in cases when the institution is experimenting with bitcoin's blockchain.  Such was the case when global stock exchange Nasdaq announced it intends to launch more blockchain projects, though it is currently developing a solution with bitcoin's ledger.  The end of cash  Still, there was thoughtful coverage that explored how bitcoin could potentially be used as a currency, as the BBC’s Rose Eveleth attempted to connect the technology to the future of cash payments.  ""It's tempting to forecast the demise of cash,"" she wrote. ""In fact, people have been predicting the end for physical money for nearly 60 years, with the rise of credit cards, contactless payments and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin the death knells have only gotten louder.""  Despite this, Eveleth said that predicting the complete disappearance of cash payments was premature given its continued popularity as well as the inability of alternatives to displace its position as the most widely used payment method.  Currently, the author noted, we lack an alternative that “is as convenient, reliable and anonymous” to cash.  “Bitcoin is anonymous, but currently unstable and inconvenient. Credit and debit cards are widely accepted, but they instantly connect your purchases with your person.”  Peer-to-peer payment systems like PayPal or Venmo, she added ""require apps and accounts, and are still easily traceable"".  Psychological attachment to money, the infrastructure available to banks, and the need to create systems that are compatible with a wide range of merchants and consumers, “all make progress away from cash more of a slog than a spring”,"" she added.  ""Cash is with us, and it will stay with us whether bitcoin and PayPal advocates like it or not,"" she concluded.  Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

42426435,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcxZh,1437742178,DigitalBTC Buys $10.1 Million in Bitcoin Despite Losses,"Australian cryptocurrency firm DigitalBTC bought $10.1m worth of bitcoin in Q2 of this year, the company's latest quarterly report reveals.  This brings the amount of bitcoin the company has purchased over the past 12 months to almost $29.7m.  The report  also shows DigitalBTC – the first crypto firm to list on Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), under Digital CC Limited – closed the quarter with an inventory of $1m in bitcoin.  Nevertheless, the company reported a negative operating cashflow of $1.2m in Q2 of 2015 having received around $10.8m for operating activities, but spending close to $12m.  Expansion  Initially a bitcoin mining company, DigitalBTC has so far expanded into bitcoin trading as well as developing both retail and consumer applications.  The company's private liquidity platform digitalX Direct achieved unaudited revenues of $5.5m in the quarter, which is a 45% increase on the revenue generated in the first quarter of the year.  Over the past three months, the company has been exploring an additional venture into the global remittances market with a soon-to-launch peer-to-peer solution called AirPocket.  ""This enables value and cash transfers from anyone to anywhere in the world, and for the value to be easily exchanged across mobile messaging platforms,"" the report states.  The company aims to initially roll out AirPocket in Latin America and the Caribbean using $3.5m raised through a share placement.

42426441,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcxnh,1437728806,ShoCard's Quest to Secure Identity on the Blockchain,"It's perhaps best explained by a car crash.  As veteran entrepreneur Armin Ebrahimi tells it in interview, his car was hit by a truck two nights ago. The driver had no insurance, and he had little reason to trust him because of the poor quality of his government-issued driver's license.  ""The picture didn't really match him. It was difficult to know it's him, the picture was a little more clean cut. It's got a PO box address on it, so I took the information I could,"" Ebrahimi explained.  Ebrahimi isn't just any driver. He's also the CEO of ShoCard, a blockchain technology startup that's seeking to harness the power of bitcoin's distributed ledger to solve pain points with authentication such as those in this process. Whether it's a true story or a convenient anecdote is unclear. Either way, the story cuts to the core of how ShoCard and blockchain technology can intercede and solve problems inherent in such an incident.  ShoCard, Ebrahimi asserts, aims to function as a mobile ID that can be verified in real time using a combination of cryptography and the immutability of bitcoin's ledger. Perhaps most importantly, the company asserts identifying information could be verifiable without requiring users to give up control of their data.  Investors are already convinced the company has found a powerful use case for the technology. ShoCard recently raised $1.5m in funding from investors including AME Cloud Ventures and Digital Currency Group.  In interview, Ebrahimi provided a deeper dive into the underlying tech of the product he hopes will transform identity on the web, mobile and real world.  Ebrahimi told CoinDesk:  ""We create a private and public key pair that allows you to access the blockchain and create separate key pairs for each of the fields that you're going to be storing [on your ShoCard]. So you have a master private key and private keys for individual data fields.""  While top of mind given his recent experience, Ebrahimi sees ShoCard as effective beyond insurance incidents, impacting how people verify themselves to e-commerce providers, banks or any third party to whom they must prove their identity to.  ShoCard in practice  Though still in the pre-launch phase, ShoCard's digital ID provides details such as the full name, address, signature, date of birth and physical details of each user. While it looks like a mobile driver's license and contains the same information, the difference, according to Ebrahimi, is each field on the ShoCard is protected with cryptography.  ""We create signatures for each field. We create a hash that encrypts the data that's on there, then we create a digital signature of it, then put it on the blockchain,"" he explains.  ShoCard doesn't put the user's data on the blockchain, rather just its own cryptographic proof that the data is correct.  ""All you can do is validate that later,"" he added. ""I would give you my public key and name and say here's my entry on the blockchain with a signature. You can use that data to go in and validate it, but I have to provide you my name to validate it.""  If both parties in the car crash were using the ShoCard system, Ebrahimi said, the app could be made to produce a QR code that when scanned could allow the users to pass the blockchain record of their identities to each other securely.  ""My ShoCard would go in, pull the data out of it to verify that it is on the blockchain. Let's say [the truck driver] was certified by the DMV and his bank. I could look at those [certifications] and say that these are ones that I can trust.""  Additionally, users could have control over what they share. In the instance of a car crash, a user might need to take another party's name and address before submitting it to a third party like an insurance provider.  ""I don't have to see everything else,"" he continued. ""I don't need to ask for his weight and eye color.""  A similar exchange, he said, could also take place without QR codes using a Wi-Fi transfer protocol such as Apple's AirDrop. Either way, digital data is validated securely using bitcoin's secure digital ledger.  Beating Facebook  Still, Ebrahimi believes ShoCard will perhaps be most immediately useful online, where online authentication is increasingly handled by Internet giants such as Google and Facebook.  Part of the current problem, Ebrahimi argues, is that these companies earn revenue from reselling data, and further, they have the ability to update their policies often, and in ways that might not always be friendly to users.  ShoCard, Ebrahimi believes, could compete against these systems if it could achieve a similar scale because the blockchain would help return control to users.  ""Until the blockchain there was no way to build the best infrastructure, keep it as secure as you can and make sure no one can compromise what's inside. There are so many public cases where credit card data is breached, we see that happen publicly over and over.""  A former CEO of Buysight and Advertising.com, Ebrahimi was also a platform engineer at Yahoo until 2008. There, he managed Yahoo's user ID and login strategy, insight which he says allowed him to see the benefits of bitcoin.  ""I was very fascinated with bitcoin and the infrastructure beneath it,"" he said. ""What I found is it provides a dramatically different approach to solving the problem and that the solution could be uniquely different than what was possible.""  He argued the blockchain provides compelling benefits even when compared to two-factor authentication, which he said has recently proven susceptible to hacking and interference.  ""Two factor is a great step forward in terms of providing security, but we're looking at two years from now, how does that landscape change and how do we do we focus on identity.""  Question of scale  The most pressing challenge for ShoCard isn't technology, Ebrahimi acknowledges, it's a question of scale. As the car crash analogy illustrates, ShoCard can only be as useful as the number of people and third-party institutions using it.  Identifying this ""chicken-and-egg problem"", Ebrahimi said, was a key factor in ShoCard choosing to adopt a business-to-business (B2B) marketing strategy.  ""The way we see this gaining traction is not us having end users download the product,"" he said. ""That's much more challenging because the use cases will be limited. What we're looking at is working with enterprises and having them be the ones who roll this out to their user base.""  Ebrahimi suggested ShoCard is already talking to banks interested in the technology, but declined to name potential partners. Presentations for the company suggest ShoCard believes its solution could be a compelling alternative to services like Verified by Visa, which while allowing major financial institutions to leverage access to user data, require them to store it in centralized databases.  More immediately, Ebrahimi sees the service as potentially appealing to bitcoin companies that currently rely on two-factor authentication services or other tools.  ""Identity has become significantly more important for bitcoin companies as they start expanding beyond early adopters,"" he said.  Until those partnerships are secure, however, the ShoCard product, will be kept under wraps. ""That's how we can get a larger user base and those users will have a use case,"" Ebrahimi said.  Element of trust  Still, the irony is that, while the blockchain is effectively a trustless system, ShoCard's partners still have to trust the system, something that has been difficult for institutions given the negative publicity surrounding bitcoin as a currency.  Ebrahimi aims to overcome this with a two-pronged strategy. First, convince enterprise businesses that using the blockchain is more secure and efficient; second, use trusted brands as distribution partners to consumers.  The first case, Ebrahimi suggested, will be easier given that enterprise companies are already trusting authentication providers with their data. If ShoCard was a traditional authentication company, he said, it would have its own database, meaning partners would have to trust that information therein is properly maintained and that it's not improperly modified or changed.  ""The people we have to convince, most of them are interested in blockchain,"" he said. ""A bank would have a hard time trusting another database, but you don't need to trust us in storing or maintaining the integrity of the data, making sure it doesn't get hacked into. I can independently validate the data and insist on its accuracy with an open database.""  It's still too early, he said, for consumers to comprehend the blockchain. But, Ebrahimi believes consumers don't need to necessarily understand it as long as they can use the technology conveniently.  He concluded:  ""One of the things we've done is hidden away a lot of that complexity from the users. You understand looking at your ID, because it's pushed out by a trusted enterprise.""
