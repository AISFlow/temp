42406262,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetA7d,1619131986,Newly Public Coinbase Lists Tether's Controversial USDT for Pro Traders,"Coinbase will list Tether's USDT on its professional trading platform, allowing investors to deposit the dollar-pegged stablecoin immediately and to begin trading next week.      Coinbase Pro announced late Thursday it would immediately allow ""inbound transfers"" for USDT in its supported jurisdictions, except for the U.S. state of New York. The stablecoin has been fraught with controversy over questions of its backing and its role in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, and at one point was the subject of an inquiry by the Office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG).      The NYAG settled the inquiry this year, stating that at previous points USDT was not fully backed by U.S. dollars but declined to bring any enforcement or regulatory action. Under the terms of the settlement, Tether will provide a periodic report to the NYAG indicating how the stablecoin is backed and what its reserves look like, starting in May.      Tether has since announced it would provide regular attestations, though these are different from the reports it will send to the NYAG and similar attestations from stablecoin issuers including Centre, Paxos and Gemini.      USDT is listed on the U.S.-based Kraken and Binance.US exchanges, but Coinbase is subject to closer regulatory scrutiny, having gone public last week on the U.S. Nasdaq exchange. The public listing subjects Coinbase to oversight by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which could include its token listings.      As such, Coinbase's move Thursday could be read as a vindication of sorts for Tether, long criticized as less-than-forthright about the composition of the reserves backing USDT.      ""Starting immediately, we will begin accepting inbound transfers of USDT to Coinbase Pro. Trading will begin on or after 6 p.m. Pacific Time (PT) Monday April 26, if liquidity conditions are met. Please note that Coinbase only supports ERC-20 USDT,"" the announcement said.      The exchange will begin supporting trading against its order books after it has sufficient supply, with trading commencing in its usual post-only, limit-only and full trading phases.      ""If at any point one of the new order books does not meet our assessment for a healthy and orderly market, we may keep the book in one state for a longer period of time or suspend trading as per our Trading Rules,"" the blog post said.      While Coinbase Pro listed USDT, it's unclear if or when the token will come to its consumer application. Typically, tokens listed on the professional platform are added to the retail side within a few days.      The move also follows a tough week for bitcoin, which has fallen 18% since Saturday. For the year to date, however, the bellwether cryptocurrency is still up a fulsome 75%.      As the largest stablecoin, USDT serves as integral plumbing for the $2 trillion global cryptocurrency market, allowing traders to easily shift dollars (or a good-enough substitute) between exchanges in order to capture arbitrage opportunities.

We’re exploring payroll conversions for our employees. Even more exciting, we’re seriously exploring mining bitcoin to add to our balance sheet,” Conger tweeted.      Jackson ""is in a prime position to be a leader in bitcoin adoption, especially for cities our size,"" Conger told CoinDesk via email. ""We are currently exploring opportunities for our employees to diversify their deferred compensation by adding a bitcoin conversion option. That will allow our employees to utilize dollar cost averaging to increase and enhance their portfolios.      “We are also looking into the cost of mining bitcoin to add to our balance sheet..""    “Because bitcoin is an appreciating asset, if we can work out the initial capital costs as well as the energy cost I firmly believe it will be a benefit to our finances as well as giving our local energy authority to balance out their energy output by mining in off-peak hours.”  Mayors 'embrace the future' of bitcoin    Conger, who was elected mayor in June 2019 and is the third member of his family to hold the position after his grandfather and great-great-great-grandfather, has been busy in recent weeks tweeting about cryptocurrency and the city’s moves toward adopting it.      On Monday, he added the laser eyes popular among bitcoin enthusiasts to his Twitter profile picture. Earlier this month he announced a blockchain task force for the city and tagged the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, another crypto advocate mayor.      On Wednesday, the mayor tweeted that local governments “will lead the way” in adopting bitcoin and “usher in a new industrial revolution with sustainable economies that will help close the wealth gap.”      Jackson, population nearly 70,000, based on recent U.S. Census data, is following the example of Miami, according to Conger. Mayor Suarez has said he envisions his city becoming a bitcoin mining hub.    Read more: Miami Mayor Previews ‘Favorable’ Crypto Policy    In an interview with CoinDesk in February, Suarez sees Miami as “a trend‑setting city at the forefront of crypto and blockchain technology,” including enabling municipal employees to receive portions of their salaries in bitcoin and residents to use cryptocurrencies for “payments and fees” – taxes among them. (In 2018, Ohio became the first U.S. state to permit taxes to be paid in bitcoin.)      “I think it’s easy to find the 14,000,604 ways something won’t work,” Conger told CoinDesk, in a seeming reference to Doctor Strange and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “Leaders have to find the way it will work.

According to a Reuters report, London's High Court will allow Wright to serve a copyright lawsuit against the publisher of bitcoin.org, who goes by the pseudonym Cobra.      The thrust of the order allows Wright to serve the lawsuit via a generic email, or Twitter, given Cobra is not an acknowledged U.K. resident. Cobra has “not disclosed a name, identity or address, according to court filings issued on Wednesday,” Reuters states.      The move is largely procedural and does not settle any questions around the origin of the Bitcoin white paper, which is the subject of the claim and which Wright claims to have written.      Wright’s long list of litigations      The court's decisions is the most recent development in a legal battle that has stretched out for years.      In particular, this lawsuit stems from Wright's widely disputed claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, author of the Bitcoin white paper, the groundbreaking document that laid the groundwork for what is now the world's leading cryptocurrency. According to Wright's reasoning, because he is Nakamoto, no other entity is authorized to host the paper. The ethos is at odds with the open-source and decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Wright sent out a rash of cease and desist letters to Bitcoin Core developers, for example, over their hosting of the white paper.      In response, the paper was initially taken down by bitcoin.org, given how the legal case would involve time, money and energy, commodities the group said it didn't want to waste on a lawsuit.      Soon after, multiple companies and organizations decided to host the Bitcoin white paper in solidarity. These included Square Crypto, crypto venture fund Paradigm, policy think-tank Coin Center and Facebook stablecoin subsidiary Novi, among others.      In response to a cease and desist order sent to Square, the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) filed a lawsuit against Wright in the U.K. over his copyright claims. The Alliance was formed in September 2020 and founded by Square to pool patents and preserve the industry’s open-source spirit.

Ether hits a fresh record price and BNB dominates.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $52,612 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 4.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $52,889-$55,233 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC below the 10-hour and 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin had its fourth day of weak market action. The world’s oldest cryptocurrency was seeing some selling action as of press time, causing the price to dip to $52,612.      Pankaj Balani, CEO of crypto derivatives venue Delta Exchange, notes that when looking at a larger trading chart time frame the outlook is starting to look bearish for bitcoin. “BTC has slipped below the 50-day moving average support that it held sacrosanct through this rally, and looks like there is more downside here,” Balani told CoinDesk.      As a result of last weekend’s bitcoin dump, BTC’s spot price is now below its 50-day moving average, the first time that has occurred since October 2020, according to the daily charts from TradingView.      “We might see a sharp bounce in bitcoin, but until it moves above $60,000 the possibility of a bull trap cannot be eliminated,” Balani added.      Perhaps one benefit of this drop in price, at least from a store-of-value perspective many bitcoin proponents advocate, is that BTC volatility continues a slow decline. Bitcoin’s 30-day annualized volatility, as measured by CoinDesk Research, was at 48.9% on April 21, a long slow fall from 2021’s high of 112.8% 30-day volatility on Feb. 9.      As a result, traders are clearly focused on other blockchain-based assets in the crypto ecosystem, Delta Exchange’s Balani said. “We are seeing strong signs in [altcoins]; ether is the focus here.”      Read More: Ripple’s Chris Larsen Says Bitcoin Should Move Away From Proof-of-Work    Ether's melting-hot performance as an alternative crypto asset    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday, trading around $2,515 and climbing 3.7% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      After last weekend’s crypto crash, when the market experienced a record-high $10 billion in liquidations on the derivatives market – the crypto equivalent of a margin call that pushed the crypto market downward – ether’s price performance has been going like gangbusters. The record high for ether’s price is now $2,645.14, according to CoinDesk 20 data, and that was achieved Thursday.      Since the past weekend's dump, when ETH was at a low of $2,067, according to CoinDesk 20 data, the price has jumped 21% at press time. Over the same time period bitcoin has fallen 2%.      Joel Kruger, a cryptocurrency strategist at the LMAX Digital exchange, says market actors are likely getting more sophisticated about investing in assets other than bitcoin, leading to strong ETH buying. “As traditional market participants familiarize themselves with the space, they are slowly discovering the value proposition that extends beyond bitcoin,” Kruger told CoinDesk.      Gary Pike, director of sales and trading at crypto liquidity provider B2C2, says attention paid to Coinbase’s direct listing and non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, have many people researching blockchain outside of bitcoin and pouring money into these nascent technologies.      “NFTs and the Coinbase [listing] have brought more people into the ecosystem that previously hadn't participated, even though they knew about bitcoin,” Pike said.      Read More: Ether Price Hits New Record High as Analysts Anticipate Supply Drop    Other markets    Bitcoin’s price has remained in stasis this week and its dominance slid below 50% for the first time since 2018. Meanwhile, alternative cryptocurrencies such as crypto exchange Binance’s BNB token are making major market share gains. Crypto dominance is a measure of its market share as a percentage of the larger ecosystem of digital assets.      Since the start of 2021, BNB, which can be used on Binance to pay for trading fees, has appreciated from 0.71% market dominance on Jan. 1, 2021, to 4.1% as of press time, a fivefold increase. Sean Rooney, head of research for Valkyrie Investments, says BNB’s rise in dominance signals further development of decentralized finance, or DeFi. “BNB is able to benefit from an explosive DeFi sector,” he told CoinDesk.      BNB operates on Binance Chain, a blockchain developer platform that is a much smaller rival to Ethereum. Rooney noted that “ETH also benefits from this as well” because the rise in BNB’s dominance brings in new users interested in the programmable money aspects of these platforms.

42406270,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetAEW,1619121518,Ethereum Gas Limit Hits 15M as ETH Price Soars,"Miners have raised Ethereum’s gas limit to almost 15 million for the first time in a bid to relieve transaction congestion at a time when on-chain activity is increasing with ether’s price (ETH) up 2.8% on the day to $2,456.      The Ethereum gas limit sets a ceiling for how many operations can be included in each block. Before the increase, miners set Ethereum’s gas limit at 12.5 million until Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin suggested raising it last week on Reddit, in light of recent code optimizations activated on the network.      “Now that the chain is safer, we can increase the gas limit, which makes every application cheaper,” Buterin said.    What is ‘gas’?    As explained by software developer Kevin Ziechmann in a blog post on the Ethereum Foundation website:      “Gas refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations on the Ethereum network...Gas [is] paid in Ethereum's native currency, ether (ETH). Gas prices are denoted in Gwei, which itself is a denomination of ETH - each Gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH (10-9 ETH).”      As background, the gas limit restricts the amount of data and computational effort required by miners to process a single block on the network. The cost of each unit of gas in terms of ETH is decided by the user, who can set a high or low gas price. Miners prioritize transactions and operations with high gas prices (and hence, higher total transaction fees) to maximize the rewards they earn on the network.      Due to finite block space and an ever-increasing volume of on-chain activity, gas fees have been soaring on Ethereum. Depending on the transaction type, associated fees can range from a few bucks to hundreds of dollars.      Increasing the gas limit allows more data to be included in each Ethereum block, which may contain a variety of operations such as peer-to-peer transfers of ETH, the creation of a new smart contract, or the exchange of fungible and non-fungible Ethereum-based tokens.    Why Ethereum miners want higher gas limits    There are potential risks when it comes to raising Ethereum’s gas limit. Larger blocks require more energy to process and finalize on the part of miners and can increase the likelihood of chain splits and orphaned blocks. That is why there is a limit to how quickly miners on Ethereum can raise the gas limit.      ""As a function of the Ethereum protocol, miners can only adjust block gas limits by 0.0976% from the previous block’s gas limit. When miners collectively agree a block gas limit is too low or too high, they can slowly work to edge that limit up or downwards with each consecutive block,” CoinDesk’s Christine Kim explained in a research report.    Read more: How Ethereum Mining Works    Ever since the completion of Ethereum’s latest backward-incompatible, system-wide upgrade, also called a “hard fork,” major mining pools have been signalling their intentions to raise the gas limit from 12.5 million to 15 million.      On April 20, Bitfly, the operator of Ethereum’s second-largest mining pool by hashrate, tweeted:      This is the seventh time in Ethereum’s history that miners have voted to increase the gas limit as a temporary solution to rising network fees. Along with the increase, Ethereum developers are also working on a parallel blockchain network, dubbed “Ethereum 2.0,” to reduce the issue of high fees and network congestion for the long-term.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | TRADING | FORKS,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media, Christine Kim",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/04/22/ethereum-gas-limit-hits-15m-as-eth-price-soars,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ee6c3e00106e83fffa23de171f265bd7d529643-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406268,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetAFV,1619119544,PancakeSwap Widens Binance Smart Chain's Lead Over Ethereum on Transactions,"A flurry of activity on the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange PancakeSwap has helped to push the number of transactions on Binance’s smart-contract blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), to five times that of the perceived industry leader, Ethereum.      While the Ethereum blockchain processed a record 1.56 million transactions on Wednesday, BSC registered a total transaction volume of 9.13 million, according to data provided by EherScan. BSC-based PancakeSwap, which generates liquidity from traders who stake tokens, known as “farmers,” alone processed more transactions than Ethereum. PancakeSwap contributed more than 2 million of BSC's transactions on the day, or some 20% of the total.      The PancakeSwap coin price (CAKE), representing the upstart platform's own tokens, has jumped 46-fold this year, for a market capitalization of about $4.2 billion.      ""New retail entrants are seemingly coming in straight to BSC/PancakeSwap through TrustWallet due to low fees,"" Avi Sanyal, head of trading at BlockTower Capital, tweeted Wednesday.      BSC surpassed Ethereum in daily transaction volume and unique active wallets in the first quarter, as soaring transaction costs on Ethereum, known as gas fees, sent traders to BSC, Tron and other rival blockchains, according to a CoinDesk Research report.      Ethereum has become a victim of its own success, as record activity has attracted blockchain-focused software developers but also led to network congestion, driving transaction costs higher. The blockchain, which specializes in ""smart contracts,"" or embedded bits of programming code that can automatically process financial tasks like lending and trading, settled $1.5 trillion worth of transactions in the first quarter. That number is bigger than the combined tally of the previous seven quarters, according to data provided by Messari.      Such staggering growth would seem a tough hurdle to clear for any competitor.      But the average Ethereum transaction fee soared to $38 in late February and stood at $28 on Wednesday, still significantly higher from the $2 to $4 range at the end of 2020, according to data source Glassnode. That's created an opening for Ethereum's competitors in the arena of ""smart-contract blockchains.""      ""With fees 100+ times cheaper than other DeFi blockchains, BSC has hit 1 million in daily active users,"" a Binance spokesman told CoinDesk in an email.      The divergence between Binance Smart Chart and Ethereum is now more noticeable than ever, with the daily transaction count on BSC nearly tripling in the past seven days or so, while that of Ethereum has increased by just 12%.      PancakeSwap has benefited from low fees compared with Ethereum’s and witnessed solid growth this month, with total collateral value rising from $5.89 billion to $10.76 billion, according to data provided by DeFi (decentralized finance) wallet DeBank. The decentralized exchange’s daily transaction count has gone up by a staggering 300% in just the past seven days.      Meanwhile, on Uniswap, an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange, the daily transaction count has increased by 30% in the past seven days. As of Wednesday, Uniswap processed 165,710 transactions – far fewer than Pancake's number.      ""The fact that BSC and PancakeSwap's daily volumes now regularly exceed that of Ethereum-based Uniswap's volumes shows that cheap transactions and scaling matter,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at trading sentiment data provider Trade the Chain, said. ""Capital is not the issue; there's plenty of it.""      PancakeSwap is now the biggest decentralized exchange in terms of total collateral value locked – a key metric for ranking the venues – standing at $10.8 billion at press time, versus $10.2 billion in Uniswap. It's the largest automated market maker on Ethereum's blockchain.      While prices for ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-largest overall, have rallied 36% to record highs above $2,600 this month, ether has lagged the performance of Binance’s in-house exchange tokens, binance coin (BNB) by a wide margin.      BNB, which can be used to pay fees on Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain, has gained 89% so far in April. PancakeSwap's own CAKE tokens have also outperformed ether with a 55% rise, for a market capitalization of $4.4 billion.      ""PancakeSwap has, without a doubt, outperformed by hitting $4 billion in market cap, and it's getting bigger by the day,"" Xiaoguang Zhang, Binance Smart Chain ecosystem coordinator, told CoinDesk. ""But BSC has $64 billion worth of tokens locked in the DeFi platform, which makes PancakeSwap account for less than 7% of BSC's growth.""      According to BlockTower's Sanyal, the user interface “to normies is infinitely better on BSC when compared to ETH. Hard to switch unless there's a big pull (better projects / more gains) or a big push (BSC breaks),"" Sanyal tweeted. “Normie” is crypto-industry jargon for someone who doesn’t usually trade cryptocurrencies and isn’t used to the market’s intricacies.      The rally in ETH, BNB and CAKE can be attributed to increased activity on their networks.      “When there’s greater usage of a cryptocurrency, there’s more demand, and that drives the price up,” blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis economist Philip Gradwell told CoinDesk last year.

42406266,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetABZ,1619116093,Bitcoiners Should Go Vegan to Save Bitcoin,"This Earth Day, I propose a simple solution to bitcoin’s massive ecological footprint: Bitcoiners should go vegan en masse. (Relax, it's satire.)      Bitcoin isn’t switching to proof-of-stake. (Sorry, New York Times.) And a pathway towards a fully sustainable mining ecosystem is anything but clear. (Sorry, Ripple, CoinShares and ConsenSys.) But there is one thing you can change: your diet.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Proof-of-work mining is a powerful cryptographic technique that’s necessary for the Bitcoin system to achieve its ends of providing a free and open alternative monetary base. Without it, Bitcoin would lose its strong finality and decentralization, meaning transactions are more likely to be rolled back. It burns energy (a lot of energy) to create a peculiar type of trust.      In doing away with centralized parties in money, Bitcoin has generated a new class of individuals willing to question hierarchies everywhere they are encountered. The most ardent supporters think from first principles, embrace anarchy and distrust any received wisdom. This attitude can have peculiar effects, including the rise of highly restrictive, carnivorous diets, thought to be closer to the ideal state of nature.      “To get to a place where you are interested in Bitcoin, you have to sort of go against the grain and come to your own conclusions,” Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications at Coin Center and budding food influencer, said in a phone call. “If you don't trust established dogma on money, then you wouldn’t on nutrition.”      It’s easy to dismiss crypto carnivory as little more than a meme – it’s certainly an ironic position for some – but there are true believers. Many of the most vocal Bitcoin advocates can also be heard championing diets rich in animal protein.      See also: Everything We Want Costs Energy, Including Bitcoin      There’s Saifedean Ammous and Pierre Rochard, who hold court over steak-and-bitcoin dinners. There’s Nic Carter, whose 10 rules for life include “eat meat” and “reject seed oil.” Some, like legendary coder Zooko Wilcox, have long embraced a carnivorous ketogenic diet, seemingly before Bitcoin was around.      The list goes on.      Just as Bitcoin is highly energy intensive, so, too, is modern industrial production of edible flesh. And if you scratch the surface, there’s way less justification for it. Bitcoin provides a public good in the form of an uncensorable, pseudo-anonymous digital currency. Factory farming provides a cheap source of energy-dense food. A chicken in every pot!      However, ""intensive animal farming,"" the industry’s term, has also led to some of the world’s highest carbon and methane emissions, poisoned rivers, the collapse of the family farm, widespread animal cruelty and abuse, exploited workers, cancerous meals, lagoons of feces, clouds of stink and the conditions that could lead to next global pandemic. (Sorry, COVID-19.)      It’s for those reasons, and more, that billionaire crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried has gone vegan.      “You can think of it from a utilitarian perspective,” Bankman-Fried said over Zoom. It divides down to a lifetime of abuse of sentient creatures for a single pleasant meal. “Factory farming is a source of suffering in the world and a man‑made one.”      There’s a genuine debate whether animals suffer the way humans do. It’s a subject too large to tackle here, though there are plenty of reasons to assume that many animals (especially mammals) have cognition and complicated emotions.      See also: Anonymous Dogecoin Donor Pays Adoption Fees at Florida Dog Shelter      Even if you take the line that animals are nothing but machines for people to use, there’s an ideologically aligned reason bitcoiners should go meatless: It’s an industry propped up by debt financing.      Some bitcoiners like to argue that modern carbo-rich diets are an expression of the “fiat mindset,” that the over-abundance of corn sugars and other “body pollutants” stem from government intervention in the food chain, but that’s also the case for the majority of what hangs in your butcher’s window.      Agrawal, who thinks bitcoiners should eat as they please, personally avoids “industrially produced” meat. He spends the extra money to buy the nice, organic, locally or family farmed choice cuts, in bulk, to practice the art of at-home butchery. “It brings you a little bit closer to the source of your food,” he said.      I often do the same. But that’s not a solution available to everyone. And frankly, it’s a lifestyle that’s hard to maintain even for those who can afford it. But it’s also missing the point.      If bitcoiners are committed to combating climate change, what better way to show it than a declaration to sacrifice meat to protect their sacred cow. It’s a public show of defiance, which they love, and a more believable form of industry activism than pretending mining can be wholly and reliably powered with solar or wind energy.      See also: CoinDesk Research – Does Bitcoin Have an Energy Problem?      To be sure, Agrawal thinks the idea that bitcoiners “need to atone for using electricity to run data centers” is wrong on the surface.

42434254,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAPnh,1619115687,State Lawmaker Explains Wyoming's Newly Passed DAO LLC Law,"Wyoming has become the first state to clarify the legal status of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).      On Wednesday, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon signed the state’s DAO-focused Bill 38 into law, allowing Wyoming to recognize DAOs as limited liability corporations (LLCs), effective July 1.      LLCs are hybrid entities that combine the characteristics of a corporation with those of a partnership or sole proprietorship. DAOs are online collectives of like-minded investors relying on Ethereum’s underlying smart-contract technology to make shared decisions.      Notably, Wyoming DAO LLCs have to be domiciled in the state, which could be a point of confusion for denizens of the decentralized web. DAOs can use a registered agent to maintain a presence in the state, the law states.      The law doesn’t do what a tech-savvy contract attorney couldn’t have already done, said Wyoming Sen. Chris Rothfuss (D-Laramie), but it does make the process of a DAO becoming an LLC easier and cheaper. Rothfuss is the co-chair of the Select Committee on Blockchain and Financial Technology that sponsored the legislation.    Read more: Wyoming Bill to Recognize DAOs as Companies Approved by Senate Committee    Proponents of the law say that it will protect DAOs from being sued as general partnerships in court and makes the rights of DAOs as legal persons enforceable in court.      “A lot of our work in Wyoming on blockchain and fintech governance has been focused on providing legal clarity where ambiguity exists before​ the court needs to decisively weigh in,” Rothfuss said, adding:    “Digital asset stakeholders made it clear to us they were concerned about facing general partnership liability in the absence of a well-defined corporate structure. Our DAO LLC legislation should dispel that concern.”  Read more: NFTs, DAOs and the New Creator Economy    The bill’s passage doesn’t mean the Wyoming legislature is finished with providing regulatory guidance around DAOs, but state lawmakers will continue to figure out where DAOs might come under regulatory scrutiny, Rothfuss added.      In the long run, the LLC statute may not be the best fit for DAOs, Rothfuss granted.      “We look for feedback from the user community to understand any shortcomings of the LLC structure so that we can improve our existing DAO legislation and consider further DAO corporate supplements,” Rothfuss said. “Maybe we need a DAO C Corp next to address other challenges. We're certainly not done yet.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/22/state-lawmaker-explains-wyomings-newly-passed-dao-llc-law,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ab404c2109003b99261de73afb9349118129680a-1500x1016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But it could present opportunities to buy the dip, according to a new report by Stack Funds, a Singapore based digital asset investment firm.      The near 15% decline in the bitcoin price (BTC) earlier this week is on a par with previous drawdowns that took roughly five to 10 days to recover. “Drawdowns happen all the time, and crypto markets are no different from traditional markets,” wrote Stack Funds.    “The fundamental narrative for bitcoin to the upside has not changed,"" the analyst wrote, noting recent news items such as WeWork’s acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment and Venmo facilitating crypto transactions on its platform show increasing adoption by businesses and mainstream users.  “Hence, it might be good ... to turn this into a buying opportunity if [investors] are looking to increase exposure of digital assets in their portfolio,” wrote Stack Funds.

They are ""not going anywhere.”      Announced Thursday, Aoki has partnered with Tom Bilyeu, motivational speaker and founder of Impact Theory, to launch the sci-fi comic-themed “Neon Future” NFT set. The pieces, created by digital artist Maciej Kuciara, will go live on Nifty Gateway on April 27.      The upcoming NFT drop isn’t Aoki’s first NFT rodeo. On March 7 he launched the “Dream Catcher” series via Nifty Gateway in collaboration with artist Antoni Tudisco. The sale raked in $4.25 million in sales with an $888,888 winning bid for a single piece, according to Rolling Stone.      The NFT market has sagged since spiking earlier this year. In April, sales fell across the sector, according to data from NonFungible.com. That said, crypto worth millions of dollars is still being spent on digital artworks.      Aoki said he invested in bitcoin back when it was trading around $11,000 thinking he was late. “I like to be early in as many things as possible like this,” he said, and as an artist, he is always “looking for the next thing” such as NFTs.      For many artists, it has been a challenging time, with creatives unable to resume touring activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, NFTs have seen growth by creating opportunities for struggling artists and their fans.    Steve Aoki’s NFT journey    Bilyeu co-created the Neon Future online comic collection with Aoki in 2018, he told CoinDesk. NFTs have been great for the market because artists no longer have to convince a “middleman” to feature their work.      “Maciej [Kuciara] doesn't have to convince the owner of a studio to put him on.

42434265,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAQ9h,1619110713,Chinese Crypto Miners Face Unstable Regulatory Environment,"The three largest Chinese bitcoin mining hubs are facing serious headwinds from regulators. This could put a big dent in hashrate production, which is the computing power to mine bitcoin. Hashrate from China contributes over 65% of the world’s total, according to some estimates.      Heavy scrutiny of coal mines in Xinjiang, new regulations on high energy-consuming companies in Inner Mongolia and the end of a local energy policy in Sichuan have unnerved some bitcoin miners in China. The regulatory challenges from these three regions are distinct, but they epitomize some of the biggest long-term policy risks when Chinese crypto miners deal with local authorities.      With so much hashrate concentrated in China, the volatile regulatory environment for Chinese miners can have significant ripple effects on bitcoin’s global market. Investor fears of a Chinese crackdown might even trigger dramatic bitcoin price movements.      “We have always thought that mining is really at the mercy of the regulatory body that it is working with,” Nick Hanson, CEO of Seattle-based crypto mining firm Luxor, said. “ In China, crypto mining is really governed by the provincial governments.”      A coal mine accident on April 10, which flooded the mine and trapped 21 miners, has prompted the Xinjiang government to suspend and conduct an inspection on other coal mines in the region. The suspension appears to have plunged the bitcoin mining power as much as 30%. The outage even appears to have pushed bitcoin transaction fees to a record high.      This event is the latest of a cluster of recent coal miner accidents reported by China’s National Mine Safety Administration, including two from Shanxi and Guizhou. These two provinces are also among the top 10 bitcoin mining areas in terms of hashrate in China for the first quarter in 2020.      While such coal mine accidents are not directly linked to bitcoin mining, they are energy sources for the fire power plants that generate electricity by burning fuels like coal or gas and provide electricity to mining farms in the winter. Chinese coal mines are among the deadliest but it remains unclear if China will put forward new regulations to scrutinize unregistered and non-compliant mines in operation.      “As we all know, there is an accident that took place in a region in China and the power outage caused by the accident has sent a huge shock to the hashrate supply,” Yin Gao, director of Fidelity Investments, said at a crypto mining conference on Saturday in Chengdu, capital of South China’s Sichuan province. “I think this is not the first time and will not be the last time in the history of crypto mining.”      “Chinese crypto mining companies should innovate and develop new energy sources to generate hashrate and have a long-term plan in terms of compliance,” Gao said.    The ultimatum    Another concern for Chinese bitcoin miners is the country government’s pledge to meet energy efficiency targets, which could limit the expansion of high energy consuming companies in certain regions.      Inner Mongolia, the second-largest fire power-based crypto mining hub behind Xinjiang, has become the forefront of the nationwide campaign.      The local branch of China’s highest economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in Inner Mongolia, said on Feb. 25 that the region would shut down and eliminate all crypto mining operations by the end of April, leading to an exodus of crypto mining businesses from the region.      To be clear, crypto mining is one of many types of high energy-consuming industries that will be expelled from the region, including steel and menthol production. Further, Inner Mongolia is only one of 30 mainland China areas that failed to meet Beijing’s energy consumption and energy intensity review in 2019.      Read More: China’s Inner Mongolia to Shutter ‘Illegal’ Bitcoin Miners by October      Nor is this Inner Mongolia’s first ban on crypto mining companies. The local government announced an inspection to eliminate “illegal” bitcoin operations in September 2019, which may indicate a struggle between local authorities and the central government.      “The inspection is directed by the central government, rather than a standalone plan initiated by the local government,” a government official told CoinDesk in a previous interview.      Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia contributed 44.28% of global hashrate for the first quarter of 2020. . However, these two regions only generated 24.65% in the summer of 2019. In the meantime, Sichuan took the lead generating 37.4% of the world’s hashrate with hydropower.    Hydropower    As local governments crack down on fire power plants that support crypto mining in the two regions, more miners are turning to hydropower-rich mining farms in Sichuan.      But Sichuan will soon face an uncertain regulatory environment as a three-year hydropower policy that favors miners comes to an end in 2022.      The local government announced its plan to build hydropower consumption parks and invite high energy-consuming companies to use excessive hydropower in certain areas of the province on August 1, 2019.      The hydropower parks tend to be more attractive to miners compared to sanctioned areas such as Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, where crypto mining is more profitable yet riskier.      Read More: Chinese Mining Hub Seeks Blockchain Firms to Burn Excess Hydropower      “Hydropower is the most compliant way for miners and it has the cheapest electricity in the rainy season,” Peicai Li, co-founder of Wayi, a Shanghai-based mining machine distributor and mining operator, said at the Chengdu mining conference.      While local governments in these areas will charge the companies a fee to operate in the parks, the relatively low electricity prices and policy risks have attracted f big data centers and cloud services companies, including crypto mining firms.      But some crypto miners fear the good times may be coming to an end.      “The policy lasts for three years and now is the second year, and we tried the program last year and increased investment this year,” Fei Liu, CEO of Bixin Mining said at the conference. “We are afraid of making any more investments next year because it will be the last year of the policy.”      In any event, Chinese miners would still face a power shortage in the winter, when Sichuan enters the dry season.      “They might have to move to other northern provinces with slightly higher electricity prices,” Hansan said. “The miners could also move some mining machines to neighboring countries but the cost could be untenable.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/22/chinese-crypto-miners-face-unstable-regulatory-environment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb9b1d1bd35de0e4ec6a07718f50e8c601215ec0-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the past few days, the cost to fund long positions in the market for bitcoin perpetual swaps, a type of derivative in the cryptocurrency markets similar to futures contracts in traditional markets, declined into negative territory, which typically precede spot price recoveries. The funding rate period is eight hours and is averaged across exchanges, weighted by the open interest, according to Glassnode.    Prior to the BTC sell-off, the bitcoin funding rate had been very high throughout April, peaking on April 10 above 0.16% per eight hours, according to Arcane.  “Once the $60,000 support was broken, a massive sell-off occurred, leading to a cascade of liquidations of over-leveraged longs.”  “The funding rates declined far into negative territory, with the average funding rates reaching -0.045%.”  Arcane noted that previous episodes of negative funding rates have usually been good entry points for long positions but cautioned that “it makes sense being extra cautious – at least when it comes to leveraged plays.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/22/bitcoin-recovers-from-panic-zone-as-funding-rates-reset,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d7693a864314dacfd4bedde35d433e40792ceeb-660x509.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an announcement, Norges Bank said the motivation for research into CBDCs remains strong as many other central banks around the world are carrying out similar experiments.  It has been four years since Norges Bank began researching CBDCs and the bank believes it is now ready for the next step, which involves “technical testing” with more in-depth analysis looking into the implications of launching a CBDC.  The central bank said payment technologies have evolved at a rapid pace, and cash payments in Norway are now probably the lowest in the world.  “Central bank cash provides the payment system with a number of important attributes that may be relevant to retain and develop further by issuing a CBDC. Additional knowledge is necessary for us to be able to decide whether issuing a CBDC is appropriate,” said Norges Bank Governor Oystein Olsen.  No timeline has been revealed for when a CBDC will be launched in Norway, “any introduction of a CBDC will still lie some time in the future,” said the bank in a statement.  Earlier this month, the Bank of Japan announced plans to begin phase one of experimenting with a CBDC by conducting experiments on the basic functions such as issuance, distribution, and redemption.  Norway’s neighbor Sweden may have a CBDC within five years, according to Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves.  In the meantime, China has been testing platforms on which the digital yuan can be freely traded with other fiat currencies.

The ratio was 48% as of 15:44 coordinated universal time (11:44 a.m. ET) and came as ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-largest overall, surged to a new all-time high.      Bitcoin's market value is about $1.02 trillion, versus about $2.13 trillion for CoinGecko's universe of 6,816 digital coins. Ether's share of the market capitalization is about 14%.      Although 12-year-old bitcoin is up 88% this year, reaching an all-time high just below $65,000 earlier in April, the rally has stalled recently, and the price has since faded to about $55,000. Instead, traders have bid up prices for other cryptocurrencies, from Aave's AAVE tokens (+347% year to date) to Zcash's ZEC (+330%).      That's in addition to the well-documented rallies in ether, up 256%, and dogecoin (DOGE), which has climbed 50-fold in 2021.      The rapid price increases are drawing comparisons to the rampant speculation that took place during cryptocurrencies' last big bull run in 2017 and early 2018, punctuated by a spate of so-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs, many of which gave way to steep losses later in 2018.

Managed by FS Investments with NYDIG custodying the bitcoin, the fund is one of two new bitcoin investment vehicles offered by newly bullish Morgan Stanley. When news of the institutional stalwart’s bitcoin offering broke last month, it kicked Wall Street’s crypto musings into high gear.      The early returns for FS NYDIG Select Bitcoin Fund LP indicate investors are indeed hungry for accessing bitcoin products through their institutional managers. Passive funds such as Morgan Stanley’s fare give clients unwilling to custody their own keys an easy way into the asset class.      In just 14 days, Morgan Stanley’s FS/NYDIG fund has become one of the most popular private bitcoin vehicles, beating out far older industry offerings from Pantera and Galaxy by investor count, according to fund data compiled by CoinDesk.      Galaxy is also accepting bitcoin investments from Morgan Stanley in a pre-existing fund. Galaxy’s three bitcoin funds (one general, two institutional) have been around since late 2019 but began accepting investments through Morgan Stanley in early April 2021. They reported around $250 million in lifetime sales earlier this month.      A source familiar with the trio told CoinDesk they receive investments from a mix of Morgan Stanley clients and outside investors.      Seeking exposure to bitcoin via a fund is not without its drawbacks. Morgan Stanley limits clients’ bitcoin bets to 2.5% of their total net worth. They must have at least $2 million in net worth and they must pay an upfront placement fee of 3% for bitcoin investments under $250,000, according to offering documents obtained by CoinDesk.      The average investment in Morgan Stanley’s new bitcoin fund was around $91,000. Morgan Stanley will receive placement fees, according to the regulatory documents.      Morgan Stanley declined to comment. NYDIG and FS Investments did not immediately respond to CoinDesk.

The federal law enforcement agency had been looking for help handling forfeited crypto for just short of a year. It requested a full-service partner to oversee everything from private key management to bookkeeping in an April 2020 notice linked to BitGo’s new award.      It was not immediately clear how deep BitGo’s new government deal runs, or how long it will last. The company did not initially provide comment to CoinDesk. USMS did not immediately respond.      But if the USMS past dealings are any indication, BitGo could be poised to handle tens of millions of dollars in the dirtiest (and, once it is offloaded by the government, paradoxically the cleanest) bitcoin around. The service occasionally auctions off seven-figure troves of crypto seized and forfeited in criminal proceedings.

Much of the crypto then flows down to USMS for storage. The agency said it averaged 62,000 seized coins annually between 2017 and 2020.      USMS will now pay BitGo to handle its bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum and other cryptos. Contract documents list management, custody, storage, bookkeeping and disposal as required duties.

The company, which manages titles including the digital trading card games My Crypto Heroes and My Crypto Saga, had relied on Ethereum since launching in 2018. But scaling and friction issues prompted Doublejump to relocate ahead of projects with larger partners, the firm said in a press release Thursday.      My Crypto Heroes is hardly a kingmaker in NFT circles: It saw a paltry $7,716 (3.2 ETH) in peer-to-peer trading over the last seven days, according to CryptoSlam. Dapper’s hyper-popular NBA Top Shot enjoyed $15.5 million over the same period. (My Crypto Heroes’ all-time volume is $4.6 million, good enough for ninth-best, per CryptoSlam data.)      But the company’s relocation to Flow nonetheless speaks to the trade-offs NFT developers must weigh in deciding where to host their projects.

42434259,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAPxh,1619099603,CBDCs and Stablecoins: The Regulatory Battle to Come,"With the increasing use of digital assets, especially in finance, we are going to enter a period of real competition between central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and their private counterparts, primarily stablecoins. This period will mark the beginning of segregation of digital assets into categories defined not only by functionality, but primarily by their regulatory appeal.    Sandro Gorduladze is the CIO of Gagra Ventures, an early-stage investment firm active in the blockchain space.    My thoughts on this below assume the following scenario for the next three to five years:    Public blockchain infrastructure (e.g. Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, etc.) starts getting real traction in finance, with institutions such as banks, insurance companies, asset managers, fintech startups and other centralized entities offering services on top of it to their customers/clients/counterparts.  Government-lead alternatives plug into those networks primarily to a) inject their CBDC with liquidity, and b) regulate/monitor activity of entities and users within their jurisdictions.  Overall, global finance becomes more interconnected and borderless with the use of these 24/7 public blockchain rails, with both centralized and more decentralized services acting as interfaces that serve specific user categories (defined by security/privacy preferences, availability in specific jurisdictions, etc.)    In the future I just outlined the tension between permissioned/public and censorship resistant/controlled is inevitable. With the help of cryptography and distributed infrastructure, it is relatively easy for individuals to opt out of the traditional financial system without any regard to applicable regulation.      The popularity of cryptocurrencies shows demand for internet-native financial services is growing. People want to transact in a borderless environment, put their money to work where it provides best yield and own exposure to assets from across the globe, not just what their local financial markets offer. Governments should not censor themselves out of this movement, which eventually makes the global financial system more efficient and thus is inevitable like any other form of progress.    Read more: Ryan Zurrer - Coming in 2021: Two Separate Digital Superhighways    I’m sure smart governments will lead the way in embracing and adopting decentralized finance (DeFi) and public blockchains, including non-financial applications like decentralized cloud services. But the struggle is still unavoidable. Other jurisdictions banning crypto will only suffer pains before having to give up. But for the reserve currency incumbents like the U.S., European Union and Japan, as well as powerful runner-ups like China, the fight may be very much justified.      For this reason, the new stablecoin projects should offer strong differentiation to their CBDC opponents, both government-run (e.g., China’s DCEP) or private, but government-regulated (potentially all U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, e.g., USDC or diem).    Decentralization    Truly decentralized mechanics are based on algorithms that need minimal human intervention. The reason for this is humans are trackable, whether public or pseudonymous. One may make an argument that it is impossible to stop an app once it’s deployed to a platform like Ethereum. But it is still very much possible to hamper all of its development and maintenance if governments want to go after founders, operators and most-active community members.      Even the previous head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Brian Brooks, (a very crypto-friendly, pro small-government kind of regulator) made straightforward comments along those lines. With the role of reserve currency governments expanding on the backend of the COVID-19 crisis, such arguments will only strengthen.      That is why projects built/lead/governed by teams based in, for example, the U.S. (like Maker DAO and the newer projects Frax, Fei and Reflexer) are at risk. I’m not implying governments will go after them, but they might exercise certain control over their founders/teams and the “decentralized community” counterargument may turn out pretty weak in the face of real pushback.      A stablecoin needs to be unstoppable by being as independent as possible from human intervention. Pseudonymity of the leading team is a secondary but relevant factor here because it keeps the focus on the tech. Governance-minimized approaches taken by teams at Lien, Gambit and (eventually) Basis Cash are all interesting experiments in this direction.    Non fiat-based stability    The majority of stablecoins today are pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar one way or another. This is not critical if those are algorithmic or collateral based (in the sense that governments might control, sanction or freeze assets). But for assets that are backed by USD (or other fiat) directly or indirectly (e.g., backed by other USD-backed stablecoins) this becomes a vulnerability. For one, the U.S. Federal Reserve effectively controls any USD-denominated bank account.      Also, in a scenario of a change in value of USD (which may happen momentarily or in a series of drastic steps, according to both history and macroeconomic theory) those assets may not appear as stable as they currently seem. That is why a crypto-native stablecoin makes much more sense in the long run. Fei, Reflexer, Lien, Float and Liquity are all backed by ETH (a decentralized asset), with Reflexer and Float also abandoning a strict peg to the USD, striving instead to keep the purchasing power of their respective tokens.      Algo coins like basis cash and empty set dollar (ESD) are formally pegged to USD but can actually be re-pegged to any other unit of account. The same goes with DAI, which was originally envisioned to transition into an SDR-like instrument, backed by a crypto basket. Meanwhile, a project called Shell, which creates “shell” tokens carrying multiple similar assets inside (e.g., all USD-pegged or BTC-pegged tokens), without any overcollateralization, is minimizing the risks of any one stablecoin within a shell’s composition, but doesn’t (yet) solve a problem of dependency on a USD peg.    True community support    Real liquidity is not measured in circulating supply but in the number of wallets that hold it. There is no use in a stablecoin that is printed in hundreds of millions of units but held only by a relatively small group of speculators (e.g., ESD). Yet, it is too early to say which of those newer breed of stablecoins actually gets a wide enough distribution to catch on. The way to gauge potential future utility, which may drive wider distribution, is to evaluate a project’s expected positioning and compare it with how passionate is the community behind it.      By ""positioning"" I mean whether it is naturally resistant to a scenario where regulators, say in the U.S., make it obligatory for the holders of stablecoins to adhere to strict know your customer/anti-money laundering rules, enforced through the admin of a smart contract (e.g., USDT).      The pushback on seigniorage algo stablecoin projects like Basis Cash or Float is usually that they are based on so-called “ponzinomics” – i.e., the implicit need for a constant inflow of capital-bearing entrants. But I’d argue in a scenario where strict KYC requirements are placed on protocol developers, you won’t need incentives other than the ability to transact freely outside of the surveilled and restricted world of government-controlled stablecoins.      The most recent proposals by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – a global super body that pushes for regulations in the KYC/AML space – may be interpreted as forcing protocol/dapp creators and maintainers (i.e., the team) to implement some form of KYC rules on the base technology level.    Read more: Sandro Gorduladze: What We Can Learn From Telegram’s Token Troubles    As you can tell, my criteria clearly favors algorithmic, anon-team lead, sometimes very experimental projects. This is a murky path, but through trial and error I’m sure the winner emerges from this space rather than anywhere else. Current experiments seem interesting, but I’d watch them with caution. As I’ve mentioned earlier: Basis Cash, Float, Lien (the stablecoin is IDOL) and Gambit are the ones I’m personally watching closely. Out of the non-anonymous projects, Shell and Liquity are the most interesting ones.      These musings are based on a rather long-term view, not necessarily current or even three to five years from now dynamics. Obviously centralized dollar-backed coins have proven to be the go-to-source of liquidity in the space and will remain to be for some foreseeable future. But as CBDC/private stablecoin tensions heat up (i.e., as the space becomes big enough to provide a real alternative to government-controlled financial systems), we could see state actors exploit the fiat dependencies of dollar-backed projects.      In my view this is inevitable, so I’d like to prepare and participate in those alternative experiments rather than wait on the sidelines. This is the biggest sector of DeFi in terms of size and impact. Smart investors are watching these projects closely, without being too much distracted by hot topics of the day.

While institutional bitcoin investment merits may overlap with retail bitcoin investment merits (for more on this, see our report on bitcoin’s value proposition), institutions face different types of pressures. Institutions face performance pressure from investors, policy pressure from regulators and reputation pressure from the public. A common concern from these stakeholders is bitcoin’s undeniable relationship with the environment and energy consumption.      While there are some headwinds to the rise of what is known as environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investing, a growing number of institutions have recognized the importance and have implemented internal mandates. BlackRock and JPMorgan, for example, have made their ESG commitments public. Younger investors also want their money to benefit society and the environment, providing a map to where they will direct funds as their wealth grows.      As the price of bitcoin continues to climb, ESG discussions become more salient. With more mainstream attention, bitcoin will come under increasing criticism for its environmental impact given its price growth is related to increased energy consumption and its well-documented ties to Chinese miners who use coal-fired energy.      Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and open-access ethos potentially give it a role in ESG funds. Yet, concerns around its environmental impact are likely to act as a barrier for institutional investors who answer to clients, boards and mandates. This report aims to address these concerns and show that bitcoin is not as polluting as its critics claim and that it can meaningfully contribute to progress in energy development as current industry trends become the norm.

42434269,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAQDh,1619095511,"Turkish Crypto Exchange Goes Offline, CEO Missing","The CEO of Turkish crypto exchange Thodex has gone missing at a time when users filed a complaint alleging hundreds of million of dollars have been stolen.      Mehmet, 34, noticed Wednesday the Turkish cryptocurrency exchange Thodex was no longer accessible; an error message was flashing across his screen. Panicking, he tried to access Thodex’s main website and found a troubling message: Thodex had halted all transactions in order to evaluate an unspecified partnership offer. The process would take about four to five business days, it continued, adding that users would be regularly updated.      Before shutting down transactions, Thodex was trading more than $585 million in cryptocurrencies on its exchange, according to data from CoinMarketCap. A spokesperson for the data site told CoinDesk the exchange stopped providing trading data around 17:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET) on April 20.      The exchange also had about 400,000 users, 390,000 of whom were trading actively, according to state news agency Anadolu.      While Thodex’s website said it would be back up shortly, exchange executives are deactivating their social media profiles and the platform’s customer support group is inaccessible. The exchange's website said “there is no cause for concern” and that “negative news on the internet” is not true. Meanwhile, Thodex founder and CEO Faruk Fatih Özer shut down his Twitter account on Wednesday.      Mehmet alerted the police of the exchange’s sudden closure, telling CoinDesk that being shut out of highly volatile crypto markets for five days could spell disaster for investors.      “Average people invest in crypto in Turkey because they would like to hedge their little funds against inflation here. So people will lose a lot of money, me included, and I had to do something about it,” Mehmet told CoinDesk.      At the same time, according to state news service Anadolu Agency, a lawyer named Abdullah Usame Ceran has filed a criminal complaint against Ozer alleging “aggravated fraud.”      Oğuz Evren Kılıç, chairman of the Ankara Bar Association’s Capital Markets and Finance Law Commission, told CoinDesk via a written statement that he’d learned through local police that Özer had left the country Tuesday night. Özer also did not respond to attempts by Bloomberg to contact him Wednesday morning. The Istanbul Anatolian Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office has launched an investigation into Thodex for “fraud” and “establishing a criminal organization,” according to CNN Turk.      A day later the exchange refuted charges of fraud in an updated statement on its website. The same statement was shared to a new Twitter account attributed to Ozer.      People in Turkey have increasingly been turning to crypto as a hedge against inflation. Inflation in the country has been on the rise this year, reaching as high as 16% in March thanks to a spike in oil prices and the recent volatility of the local lira, according to Bloomberg. Although the crypto space was unregulated in the country, earlier this month, the central bank announced that the republic was banning the use of cryptocurrencies for payments.      Crypto trading remains unaffected by the new law, which is set to go into effect at the end of the month. So Thodex’s sudden disappearance appears to be an isolated incident.      “There may be a scam here because there have been problems with this exchange for days,” Kılıç said.    The dogecoin mystery    Mehmet first thought something wasn’t right with Thodex when he saw certain cryptocurrencies – including dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that was created as a joke in 2013 – were trading on the exchange for much lower prices than on other markets on the night before the exchange shut down.      In fact, on April 17, one Twitter user pointed out that dogecoin was selling on Thodex up to 30% below the market price. This was at a time when, a few days later, dogecoin’s price briefly replaced digital asset XRP as the fourth-largest coin by global market capitalization on Monday.      On April 19, the exchange announced it was carrying out a short-term maintenance on dogecoin transactions.      Right before the exchange went offline, dogecoin accounted for more than 53% of Thodex’s $585 million trading volume, compared to a measly $10 million in bitcoin.      “This exchange has been experiencing a great deal of traffic over dogecoin for a few days. Tens of thousands of customers flocked to the website of this exchange. In fact, even this price imbalance was suspicious,” Kılıç said.    Company reshuffle or exit scam?    According to the message posted on the Thodex website, transactions have been put on hold while the exchange considers a potential partnership with undisclosed parties.      “World-renowned banks and fund companies, whose name we will announce when the agreement process is completed, have been wanting to invest in our company for a long time and have made a partnership proposal. In order to serve you better, it has been decided to evaluate the partnership offer positively. In order for this process to be completed, the transactions must be stopped and the transfer process must be completed,” the statement said in Turkish.      Ismail Hakki Polat, a blockchain lecturer at the Kadir Has University in Istanbul, said that based on the statement made by the company, the only possible conclusion he could come up with was that Thodex’s shareholder structure will be changed with the new investors.      “Before that, all views can be regarded as speculative comments that will panic the crypto investors and jeopardize the local ecosystem,” Polat said.      Thodex claims to be the “first licensed Turkish Company in the sector globally” with a license “received from the United States of America,"" according to its statement.      The firm is referring to its registration as a Money Service Business (MSB) with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or FinCEN. However, the registration of a business on the MSB Registrant Search Web page is neither a recommendation, a certification of legitimacy, or an endorsement of the business by any U.S. government agency. It is also not a license.      Crypto exchanges can operate in the U.S. by securing money transmitter licenses through state government entities. A FinCEN registration does not on its own permit exchanges to commence trading operations.      Meanwhile, Kılıç, who has been offering legal advice to those affected by Thodex’s sudden suspension of operations, says customers have not been able to reach the exchange officials, and no customer has been able to withdraw their money or crypto so far.      Mehmet remains hopeful the exchange's closure is temporary.      “Apparently, the guys are not running away and this is not a scam or anything. I think what they've done is they’ve damaged themselves and also their customers,” Mehmet said.    An update and new Twitter account    On Thursday, the Thodex website updated the statement on display, claiming the allegations against the exchange by users and the media were unfounded. A new Twitter account, claiming to be Özer's shared the statement.      It appears Özer himself wrote the message, which goes on to say that during partnership negotiations an abnormality was found in the company accounts. Specifically, the message states 30,000 user accounts (out of some 700,000) were found to be suspicious, and are being cleared.      “Thodex Platform has been temporarily closed to determine the reasons and sources of this. While our technical team of our company was conducting this research, I personally went abroad on 19.04.2021 to make final meetings with foreign investors,” the message said in Turkish.      Özer added that as a result of the “smear campaign” against him and his company, it has become difficult to continue its “commercial life.”      “In this way; I kindly submit to the public's knowledge that the smear campaign against both myself and my company should not be respected,” Özer said.      Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that a senior official in Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s office called for the rapid regulation of the crypto space. Bloomberg also reported that the Turkish government had moved to block Thodex’s accounts and police had raided its head office in Istanbul.      UPDATE (Apr. 22, 2021, 14:17 UTC): The article has been updated to include a new statement released by Thodex CEO Faruk Fatih Özer.

Amid the backdrop of Earth Day, Chris Larsen said the PoW consensus mechanism is a massive drain on power consumption and a ""growing source"" of CO2 emissions, according to a blog post on Thursday.      Instead, the executive argues core developers, miners and exchanges should consider moving away from the years-old mechanism to something less taxing on the environment.      ""Cryptocurrencies that use PoW should consider a code change to another validation method such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) or Federated Consensus (or something yet to be developed),"" wrote Larsen.      The PoW consensus mechanism is costly. The current draw from bitcoin alone amounts to an average of 113 TWh a year, enough to power 12 million U.S. homes, according to data from Cambridge University. The damage to the environment is also considerable with an estimated 63 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) released every year, added Larsen.

42434262,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPAPrh,1619088060,"Binance’s Tesla, Coinbase Stock Tokens Under Scrutiny From UK Regulator: Report","Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, has attracted the attention of regulators for selling “stock tokens,” designed to track the performance of shares in crypto-friendly companies like newly listed Coinbase and Tesla, the Financial Times reports.      Red flags have already been raised by Hong Kong law firms regarding the two tokens launched earlier this month, which allow Binance customers to purchase as little as one-hundredth of a regular stock using Binance USD (BUSD), a U.S. dollar stablecoin issued by the exchange.      U.K. regulator the Financial Conduct Authority told theFT it is “working with the firm to understand the product, the regulations that may apply to it and how it is marketed.”      German regulator BaFIN did not confirm whether an investigation into Binance’s stock tokens was underway, but said if the “tokens are transferable, can be traded at a crypto exchange and are equipped with economic entitlements like dividends or cash settlements, they represent securities and are subject to the obligation to publish a prospectus.”      Binance says the products are compliant with the European Union’s Mifid II markets rules and BaFin’s banking regulations and don’t require a prospectus because the tokens can only be bought and sold within the walled garden of CM-Equity, a regulated Munich-based investment group that processes the token trades.      Tesla and Coinbase token holders are indeed entitled to potential dividends, Binance said, but don’t confer any of the voting rights associated with regular securities.      Trading in securities is a heavily regulated business activity the world over. However, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has said he believes the exchange’s foray into stock tokens “demonstrates how we can democratize value transfer more seamlessly, reduce friction and costs to accessibility, without compromising on compliance or security.”      Meanwhile, Binance has been beefing up its regulatory clout with senior hires including Brian Brooks, former Office of the Comptroller of the Currency chief, to head Binance.US.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/22/binances-tesla-coinbase-stock-tokens-under-scrutiny-from-uk-regulator-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8f5c2c8fe1fe4d80f16702ea3970a9ce5380290-2484x1580.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386539,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTomP,1619078400,"Fireblocks, Celsius Back Zero-Knowledge Credit Scoring for Institutional Crypto Traders","There’s a ton of innovation right now in decentralized finance (DeFi), but crypto lending more broadly – sometimes called centralized finance (CeFi) – just got a whole lot smarter, too.      Announced Thursday, San Francisco-based trading tech firm X-Margin and cryptocurrency custody provider Fireblocks are working to standardize the fragmented state of lending and borrowing of digital assets for institutional trading. The first users of this institutional credit sourcing platform are lending giant Celsius and crypto hedge fund Dunamis Trading.      Unlike traditional capital markets, cryptocurrency trading began with retail and then gradually evolved towards institutional finance – as opposed to the other way round. A vibrant lending industry has since emerged to take advantage of inefficiencies, such as where firms have to pre-fund accounts at many different exchanges and trading venues. (In the traditional markets, traders only need to have capital at their prime broker, who will allow them to trade across many venues.)      Meanwhile, crypto’s unique and nascent infrastructure allows for plenty of arbitrage opportunities so capital-hungry traders are happy to pay high interest rates.      To iron out some wrinkles and finesse more of a prime brokerage feel to crypto trading, X-Margin has created a privacy-preserving credit management system for lenders and institutions. The partnership with Fireblocks ensures there’s a safe and secure walled garden for cross-exchange lending.    Read more: Signature Bank Goes Head-to-Head With Silvergate in Bitcoin-Backed Lending    “The problem right now for crypto traders is that to get loans or receive leverage from lenders like Celsius or BlockFi, they need to over-collateralize,” Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov said in an interview. “So for every dollar of bitcoin they borrow, they have to post a dollar-point-two as collateral for the safety of the loan. Borrowers are suffering because they can't get cheap loans and lenders are at risk because they lack visibility.”      Using the X-Margin Credit system, if Celsius is going to lend to a hedge fund like Dunamis, the fund’s risk profile is made available on the fly, based on all the positions it has across venues like Binance, BitMEX or Deribit, for example. This is done using anonymous data thanks to zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), so the lender is not privy to the hedge fund’s whole trading strategy.    ZKPs in action    A former hedge fund trader and market maker on Deribit, Darshan Vaidya, founder and CEO X-Margin, saw early on how privacy-preserving computations and ZKPs (the ability to prove possession of secret information without divulging its content) were going to be instrumental in providing a more efficient trading infrastructure for crypto.      “X-Margin Credit is a provably unbiased arbitrator of trading risk,” Vaidya said in an interview. “We calculate trading firms’ overall risk so that lenders extending credit can make real-time decisions about that, without traders needing to reveal their sensitive trade data to anyone, including us.”      Under the hood, X-Margin’s privacy solution combines Intel SGX private enclaves with ZKPs that are “super-fast relative to what’s out there"" and built internally by the company, said Vaidya.      “Our system could be fully decentralized if need be,” said Vaidya. “But you can basically facilitate trust from lender to trading firm with this zero-knowledge calculator in between, without having to have a consensus model to get that trust. Because it's a provably neutral mathematical proof, we've disintermediated some middleman that would normally be required to make that credit decision.”      X-Margin Portfolio Lending is now live and in operation, with Celsius providing a loan to Dunamis Trading, the terms of which are not being disclosed.      “As a lender, this gives us the tools to extend credit with confidence, managing credit risk when the value of the borrower’s trading portfolio changes constantly,” Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/22/fireblocks-celsius-back-zero-knowledge-credit-scoring-for-institutional-crypto-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c96e160486ea65578018b414026ad99508806ae9-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new offerings include a private equity fund in the global crypto mining businesses, an actively-managed crypto fund and two funds which will invest directly in bitcoin and ethereum. The funds are open to institutional investors such as family offices, asset managers and high-net-worth individuals.      Huobi Tech is the latest to attract asset allocators from the traditional financial services industry in Hong Kong. In September 2019, the city's financial watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), put forward a clear regulatory framework for crypto assets and started doling out virtual asset licenses to crypto trading platforms, custodians and crypto fund managers.      The move came after Huobi Tech acquired the virtual asset license from SFC in March, which allows the firm to set up and operate funds whose underlying assets are cryptocurrencies.      Huobi Tech, formerly known as the public electronic appliance company Patronics, was acquired by crypto exchange Huobi’s founder Leon Li through a reverse takeover in 2018.      The crypto asset manager has secured $50 million across the four funds and aims to double funding in the near future, Lily Zhang, CFO of Huobi Tech, told CoinDesk in an interview.      The private equity fund will invest in a variety of mining services along the supply chain, including mining machine manufacturers, mining pools and mining farm operators in China and the international market, according to Zhang.      The PE fund will not invest in public crypto mining companies such as Riot or Hut8. The firm's actively managed crypto fund, Multi-Strategy Virtual Assets Fund, plans to make investments in a mix of crypto assets.
