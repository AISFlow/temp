Record Low Funding Rates on Binance Signal Market Shift,"According to the latest data from CryptoQuant, bears might be in control of Bitcoin given the asset‚Äôs funding rates reaching a negative level across all crypto exchanges, including Binance. For context, funding rates are essential in perpetual futures markets to ensure the price of perpetual contracts aligns closely with the spot market. These rates can be either positive or negative, depending on market conditions. A positive funding rate implies that long position holders pay shorts, typically signaling bullish sentiment. Conversely, negative funding rates suggest shorts pay longs, indicating bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Nears Dangerous Territory ‚Äì $40,000 On The Horizon? Funding Rates Signal Market Shift According to EgyHash, the analyst who reported this significant rise in funding rates on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, Bitcoin‚Äôs funding rates on Binance have dipped to unprecedented negative levels that have not been seen ever since October 2023. The analyst revealed that this prolonged negativity in funding rates, lasting over three consecutive days, highlights an intensifying ‚Äúbearish sentiment‚Äù among traders. Notably, the significance of these negative rates is compounded by Binance‚Äôs substantial share in the open interest (OI) across crypto exchanges. This dominant position suggests that the sentiments reflected in Binance‚Äôs funding rates could presage broader market movements. $BTC funding rates have reached the highest level of negativity YTD on Binance ‚ÄúBinance has the largest share of open interest (OI), this could indicate a bearish market sentiment for the short term.‚Äù ‚Äì By @EgyHashX Read more üëáhttps://t.co/lGCUSic8kl pic.twitter.com/bfCPAYy1Z8 ‚Äî CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) August 16, 2024 When funding rates remain negative, it generally points to an expectation among traders that prices may decline further. This bearish outlook might encourage selling, potentially leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy as downward price movements encourage more shorts. The analyst particularly noted: This means that short positions are now dominating the perpetual market. Taking this into consideration, and as Binance has the largest share of open interest (OI), this could indicate a bearish market sentiment for the short term. However, there is a catch. While this negative change in funding rate may spell a plunge for BTC, extremely negative funding rates can sometimes precede a market reversal if shorts begin to cover their positions, leading to a rapid price surge. Bitcoin Market Performance So far, Bitcoin has been unable to reclaim its psychological level of $60,000 following a plunge below it on August 14. Instead, the asset has continued to range between $59,000 to $56,000 region over the past few days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Observes Pullback To $58,000: Is This The Cause?

32495384,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635978,1723845626,When To Be Bearish On Bitcoin? On-Chain Analyst Answers,"An on-chain analyst has explained signals in several metrics to see if Bitcoin is in a bearish phase. These Bitcoin Indicators Could Be To Follow For Bear Market Signals In a new post on X, on-chain analyst Checkmate replied to a user asking about an on-chain metric indicating when it‚Äôs time to turn bearish on cryptocurrency. Checkmate has shared two indicators: the Short-Term Holder Realized Profit/Loss Momentum and the Short-Term Holder MVRV Ratio Momentum. ‚ÄúShort-Term Holders‚Äù (STHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days, meaning that both of these metrics are only for the recent buyers in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Observes Pullback To $58,000: Is This The Cause? First, the ‚ÄúRealized Profit/Loss Momentum‚Äù measures, as its name suggests, the momentum in the ratio of the profit and loss that the STHs are realizing through their selling. Below is the chart for the indicator posted by the analyst. According to the analyst, it is time to be bearish when the oscillator on the bottom of this chart turns red (corresponding to negative momentum in the STH Realized Profit/Loss). The graph shows that this oscillator assumed negative values soon after the price set its new all-time high (ATH) and has since remained in the region. And indeed, while the indicator has seen these values, Bitcoin has been going through a rough phase. The STH MVRV Ratio Momentum‚Äôs second indicator works similarly and keeps track of the distance between the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio for this cohort and its 155-day moving average (MA). The MVRV Ratio is a popular indicator that tells us how the value held by the investors (the market cap) compares against what they used to purchase their coins (the Realized Cap). In other words, the metric provides information about the unrealized profit/loss of the holders. Thus, whereas the Realized Profit/Loss keeps track of the net profit/loss the investors are harvesting through their selling, this metric tells us about the profit/loss they have yet to take. Related Reading: This Is The On-Chain Level That Made The Bitcoin Crash Bottom Here is the data for the momentum indicator for the MVRV Ratio specifically for the STHs: According to the analyst, just like with the first indicator, this one also gives a bearish signal when the momentum turns red. As the chart shows, the STH MVRV Ratio has been under its 155-day MA for the same period as the bearish momentum in the Realized Profit/Loss, thus providing confluence to the signal. BTC Price Bitcoin had pushed towards $62,000 earlier in the week, but the asset has since slipped up as it‚Äôs now back at $57,800.

32493404,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635945,1723840239,Litecoin Comeback: Bullish Reversal Sets The Stage For $76.85 Target,"Litecoin (LTC) is making a strong comeback as a bullish reversal takes place, setting the stage for a potential move toward the $76.85 target. After bouncing off a critical support level, Litecoin has regained upward momentum, signaling renewed optimism among market traders. Key technical indicators now point to further gains, with $76.85 emerging as the next significant resistance level. As the market responds to this bullish shift, this article will delve into Litecoin‚Äôs bullish reversal and assess the significance of the $76.85 target and its implications for future price action. Litecoin has increased by 2%, trading around $65.37 in the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization has exceeded $4.8 billion, with a trading volume surpassing $410 million at the time of writing. Litecoin‚Äôs market cap has grown by 2%, while its trading volume has surged 42.12%. Analyzing Litecoin‚Äôs Bullish Reversal To $76.85 Litecoin‚Äôs price on the 4-hour chart is bullish, having crossed above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it approaches the $76.85 level. The digital asset has experienced a significant price increase since rebounding from the $50 support level, signaling a strong rise in positive momentum that could drive further gains. Additionally, an analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the signal line of the indicator has successfully risen above 50% and is currently trending around 63%, suggesting that the bulls are still in control and could drive the price higher. On the 1-day chart, although Litecoin is still trading below the 100-day SMA, it demonstrates upbeat resilience, steadily advancing toward the 100-day SMA and the $76.85 level, with multiple bullish momentum candlesticks forming. This suggests active bullish momentum for the cryptocurrency. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI indicator indicates a rising positive momentum for the cryptocurrency. The RSI signal line has moved out of the overbought zone and is currently attempting a move above 50%. Conclusion: Is Litecoin Poised For A Breakout Beyond $76.85? Recent trading indicates that Litecoin, with its strong bullish momentum, could reach the $76.85 level. If the cryptocurrency reaches and surpasses this resistance, it may trigger further positive moves toward the next resistance at $89.74. If this level is breached, it may lead to further price gain toward the $105.9 resistance level and beyond. Conversely, if bearish pressure prevails and Litecoin fails to break through the $76.85 resistance, the price could decline toward the $57.41 support.

Bitcoin Is Still On Verge Of Bear Market In This Indicator In a new post on X, CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has discussed the latest trend in the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator. The ‚ÄúBull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator‚Äù from CryptoQuant is an indicator based on the P&L Index. The P&L Index combines a few popular BTC metrics related to profit and loss, so it sums up the market balance in one value. This indicator can ascertain whether the asset is going through a bullish or bearish period by comparing it against its 365-day moving average (MA). Related Reading: Bitcoin Observes Pullback To $58,000: Is This The Cause? When the cryptocurrency breaks above its 365-day MA, it can be assumed to be inside a bull market. Similarly, falling under this MA implies a transition toward a bear market. The Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator, the actual metric of focus here, exists to make this pattern easier to follow; it keeps track of the distance between the P&L Index and its 365-day MA. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator over the past couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle indicator had reached extreme values during the price all-time high (ATH) earlier in the year (colored in red). At these levels, the P&L Index has quite the gap over its 365-day MA, so the cryptocurrency‚Äôs bull rally has become overheated. The graph shows that the metric also gave this signal on a few other occasions during the past two years, and each time, the asset‚Äôs price reached the top. However, these previous tops weren‚Äôt enough to hold the market back in the long term, as the Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator continued to maintain inside the bull territory (shaded in orange), where the P&L Index is above its 365-day MA. Related Reading: This Is The On-Chain Level That Made The Bitcoin Crash Bottom However, bull market momentum has finally shown signs of running out, with the indicator even briefly plunging into the bear territory (light blue) during the recent price crash. While the metric has recovered back into the bull region with the surge that BTC‚Äôs price has observed, it‚Äôs still very close to the neutral mark, meaning it can potentially sink back into the bearish zone shortly. Based on this trend, Moreno notes that BTC could still risk seeing a further correction. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen its recovery stall recently, as its price is still trading around the $58,500 mark.

To him, this is a very opportunistic time for long-term investors, most especially those with a bullish outlook. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin (DOGE) Headed For A 40% Slide? This Analyst Thinks So He feels that ATOM is currently trading at quite a remarkable discount from the highs posted, hence positioning itself for a very compelling risk-reward entry. According to Santana, Cosmos has ‚Äúa great chart‚Äù because the coin is trading very low compared to historical prices. ‚ú¥Ô∏è Cosmos (ATOM) Pre-2025 Bull-Market Accumulation Zone & Strategy Cosmos has a great chart‚Ä¶ How are you doing my dear friend? Ready for a new yesterday, tomorrow-today? Are you ready to explore this chart with me in this wonderful day? Cosmos has a great chart because it is‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/SH4yrF76yd ‚Äî Alan Santana (@lamatrades1111) August 14, 2024 Cosmos: Accumulation Phase and Risks Santana emphasized that Cosmos was in its critical phase of accumulation. On the other hand, ATOM has historically formed higher long-term lows, which could be a technical indicator setting a stage for future gains. However, accumulation comes with risks. The key level to watch would be $1.923, a low from March 2020. Should the price of ATOM go below this threshold, it would somewhat undermine the bullish narrative Santana presents. Such a decline could be interpreted as a shift in market sentiment and would result in weaker performance compared with other cryptocurrencies. Another pressure on ATOM comes from insider selling. As soon as the developers, miners, or exchanges begin to sell their holdings en masse, that usually becomes a red flag indicator of problems within the project or, at the very least, a lack of belief in its further perspective. This might be why, in particular, Cosmos can‚Äôt hold up that well compared to other altcoins, which have been able to stay above their June 2022 lows. Bearish Forecast And Market Sentiment Although Santana‚Äôs sentiment is slightly overly hopeful, the market sentiment is overwhelmingly bearish. According to CoinCodex‚Äôs most recent prediction, Cosmos will lose 8.56% and its price will fall even further to $4.13 by September 15, 2024. All technical indicators in this forecast are bearish. The Fear & Greed Index has finally reached 27, showing much fear in the market. For Cosmos, there have been nine green days during the last 30 days‚Äîout of a possible total of 30. This translates into a positive return rate of 30%. Its current price volatility is at 11.64%, indicating a highly uncertain and risky time frame. Well, considering the current state of the market, it may not be an ideal time to invest in Cosmos. Based on the factors mentioned above, namely the price drop forecast and the current sense of fear in the market, it would seem that caution is due. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Analyst Pinpoints Prime Moment For Strategic Buy Weighing The Risks and Rewards Although Santana‚Äôs analysis shows that this could actually be beneficial for future gain, the outlook immediately is not so promising. The factors therefore have to be taken into consideration by the investor prior to buying. Cosmos is a high-risk, high-reward scenario. The current low price and previous higher lows could yield huge rewards for long-term investors who can handle the storm. However, adverse mood, insider selling, and price decrease expectations are risks.

32487492,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=636001,1723824033,MATIC Set For Rebranding In Early September: Will Polygon Prices Recover After Sinking 65%?,"MATIC, the native token of the Ethereum sidechain Polygon, has had it rough in the past five months. After soaring above $1.2 in March, the token has been in freefall, dumping over 65%. For now, MATIC faces strong rejection at $0.45 and continues to distribute, which is evident in the daily chart. The lull across the crypto scene and shrinking activity in DeFi means Polygon is on the receiving end. Despite these market-related challenges, there is a silver lining for MATIC holders. The Rebranding Of MATIC To Polygon Polygon is evolving, and after the rebranding from the Matic Network, MATIC, the native token, will be relaunched as POL. This highly anticipated upgrade is set for September 4, 2024. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Unveils Six ‚ÄòSuper-Cycle‚Äô Tokens Primed For Massive 1000x Price Explosion The rebranding will be a pivotal shift for Polygon, making a stage in which the platform introduces new utilities to POL as they look to grow and further innovate, primarily by scaling Ethereum. In a post on X, Polygon said various changes would accompany the rebranding. If anything, the team plans to overhaul the current utility in MATIC and repurpose it to meet the needs of their grand plans from now on. After September 4, Polygon said POL would serve as an autonomous fuel, a change that could also support prices. Under the new arrangement, POL will be crucial for ensuring Polygon is secure. The token will be distributed to validators as a reward for committing resources. The steady stream of rewards, Polygon said, would incentivize validators to commit even more resources. At the same time, a portion of POL will be channeled to the Community Treasury. The funds will be used to super-charge development and research, with some allocated to the ecosystem initiatives. The Grants Program And Polygon 2.0: Will It Revive Demand? Polygon has activated the Community Grants program, dedicating 100 million POL per year for the next decade to spur development in the ecosystem. The objective is to catalyze growth and ensure the platform is secure. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin (DOGE) Headed For A 40% Slide?

Platforms launching as Ethereum layer-2s using the Polygon development stack will also receive liquidity from a unified source. At the same time, they will be interoperable with other layer-2s using the same stack since they are connected via the Aggregation Layer. Despite all these efforts, only time will tell whether MATIC will inch higher. The local resistance is at $0.45. If broken, the token must be more than 2X before reclaiming March highs.

42417425,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYLvx,1723822223,Bitcoin's Programmability Draws Closer to Reality as Robin Linus Delivers 'BitVM2',"New ""BitVM2"" paper from Robin Linus and a team of co-authors marks a leap forward from the initial design.  Project would rely on advanced cryptography and a novel design to facilitate a secure ""bridge"" for transferring bitcoins from the main network to auxiliary networks known as ""rollups.""  Unlike the earlier incarnation, BitVM2 is ""permissionless,"" allowing anyone to challenge suspicious transactions, not just a fixed set of operators.  Robin Linus, the Bitcoin developer who shook up the crypto tech landscape last year with a theoretical method of making the oldest and original blockchain more programmable, is out with a second iteration called ""BitVM2"" ‚Äì boasting dramatic improvements that could bring the concept closer to real-world implementation.  The basic setup involves using cryptography to compress programs into sub-programs that can then be executed within Bitcoin transactions, according to a white paper published Thursday by Linus along with five co-authors.  The programs are then ""verified"" ‚Äì basically making sure nobody is trying to cheat or steal ‚Äì in three on-chain transactions. In the previous version, the verification could take upwards of 70 transactions, according to one of the co-authors, Alexei Zamyatin, who separately works for a project called BOB, short for Build on Bitcoin.  A key improvement of the new version is that anyone can call into question a suspicious transaction, in a feature known as ""permissionless challenging."" In the original BitVM, which was published last October but never really put into any practical implementation, only a fixed set of operators could initiate challenges.  ""This design gives us these major improvements,"" Zamyatin said in a video interview with CoinDesk. ""We now have a full and comprehensive writeup of the BitVM paradigm.""  Linus is a core contributor at ZeroSync Association, a Swiss non-profit organization based in the canton of Zug. The other co-authors besides Zamyatin included Lukas Aumayr, Andrea Pelosi, Zeta Avarikioti and Matteo Maffei.  Linus's project has been hailed as a breakthrough partly because it doesn't require any changes to the underlying Bitcoin code. That's crucial since Bitcoin is, more so than most subsequent blockchain projects, fully decentralized in its governance; there isn't really a guiding foundation or governing body or lead developer as there is with, say, Ethereum or Solana.  Even seemingly modest proposals like the much-discussed OP_CAT have faced difficulty getting adopted by the maintainers of the Bitcoin code, since nearly total consensus has evolved to be the de facto standard for suggested updates.  The initial application of BitVM2 would be to enable a ""rollup"" ‚Äì essentially a separate auxiliary network atop Bitcoin that could handle faster and cheaper transactions, but with similar security guarantees.  Just the publication of Linus's original design helped to inspire a fervor for building projects on Bitcoin; as of July, CoinDesk counted at least 83 Bitcoin layer-2 projects in the works, with a variety of setups, including rollups as well as sidechains.  The new paradigm could be used to create a blockchain ""bridge"" that could be used to securely transfer bitcoin to the rollup, and later safely bring it back so the deposits could be withdrawn.  While Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism ‚Äì the method of confirming transactions, essentially involving data centers working nonstop to solve cryptographic puzzles, with heavy electricity consumption ‚Äì has been criticized for its environmental impact, most blockchain experts agree that it is the most secure blockchain.  Such a virtue is underscored by the $1.2 trillion market value of all bitcoin outstanding ‚Äì more than all other cryptocurrencies combined.

32485510,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635971,1723818618,"Silk Road Bitcoin Are ‚ÄòAlmost Certainly‚Äô Sold By US Gov, Claims Lawyer","Another transfer by the US government of originally seized Bitcoin from the notorious Silk Road has sparked widespread speculation on Wednesday, August 14. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham reported yesterday that 10,000 Silk Road BTC, valued at approximately $593.5 million, were transferred to Coinbase Prime, a platform used primarily for institutional investors. According to Arkham‚Äôs post on X: 10,000 Silk Road BTC ($593.5M) moved to Coinbase Prime. Wallet bc1ql received 10K BTC from a known US Government wallet 2 weeks ago. This BTC has just been sent on to 33J, a Coinbase Prime deposit wallet.‚Äù Is The US Gov Selling Bitcoin? This transaction comes on the heels of a June announcement from the US Marshals Service (USMS), part of the Department of Justice, detailing a new partnership with Coinbase Prime to provide custody and advanced trading services for the agency‚Äôs ‚ÄúClass 1‚Äù (large cap) digital assets. The community is torn over whether these moves signify the selling of the Bitcoin or merely a transfer for custody purposes. Thus, many speculated that the US gov is not selling. Related Reading: Sovereign Wealth Funds Could Take Bitcoin To $148,000: Researcher However, Scott Johnsson, a finance lawyer and general partner at Van Buren Capital, expressed a distinct view today, arguing that the transaction signals a definitive sale of the seized assets by the US government. Johnsson remarked: ‚ÄúYes, US Marshal Service (USMS) is almost certainly selling silk road Bitcoin USMS has been sending BTC to a custodial address required by the terms of the servicing agreement [‚Ä¶] Given the agreement requires USMS assets remain completely segregated, whenever a transfer is ultimately made to CB prime (or other commingled exchange address), you can be sure USMS has already sold or is selling imminently.‚Äù Johnsson further supported his claim by referencing the DOJ‚Äôs Office of Inspector General (OIG) report and the crypto services agreement RFP, which stipulate the rapid liquidation of assets within five business days of forfeiture and the necessity of segregated wallet addresses to prevent co-mingling with other assets. It states: ‚ÄúThe USMS intends to resolve this issue using its planned cryptocurrency services contract, which will require the contractor to liquidate cryptocurrency within 5 business days of the asset being forfeited.‚Äù Related Reading: Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Nears Dangerous Territory ‚Äì $40,000 On The Horizon? Johnsson anticipates that formal confirmation of these sales might not emerge until the publication of the DOJ‚Äôs Asset Forfeiture Program FY2024 report in January. However, the unfolding events could provide earlier indications as more details become available through official channels or subsequent asset movements. ‚ÄúOfficial confirmation will definitively come (at the latest) upon the DOJ‚Äôs Asset Forfeiture Program FY2024 report in January, if not earlier. I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence this began in earnest following the Trump speech.‚Äù Users on X expressed their confusion regarding Johnsson‚Äôs analysis. Rodeo queried: ‚ÄúThese coins were supposed to be sold by the end of last year[‚Ä¶] You‚Äôre saying the act of transferring these coins to Coinbase from their current address is enough to imply selling because the Coinbase addresses are not completely segregated addresses?‚Äù Responding to these concerns, Johnsson clarified: ‚ÄúNot necessarily Coinbase alone (there‚Äôs an interim segregated custody step), but once they hit commingled addresses it‚Äôs reasonable to infer they‚Äôre sold. And yea, there was a backlog of forfeited BTC that was supposed to be sold already. Finalizing the services agreement appears to have been (at least part of) the hold up.‚Äù Notably, the latest BTC transaction by the US government comes just a few weeks after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed to establish a ‚Äústrategic national Bitcoin stockpile‚Äù at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. After that, rumors emerged that Democrats under the lead of Kamala Harris could empty the BTC holdings by the US government from confiscations. While Harris pleads to take a more pro-crypto stance, several experts refuse this claim, based on the latest actions by her. At press time, BTC traded at $59,336.

U.S. miners' share of the Bitcoin network hashrate rose to a new record high of 26%, the bank said.  The bank noted that the network hashrate has risen about 1% so far this month.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} mining stocks gave back artificial intelligence (AI) related gains in the first two weeks of August as the network hashrate rose which pushed mining profitability to record lows, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Friday.  Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain.  The total market cap of the fourteen U.S. listed miners the bank tracks fell 18% since the end of July, and ""currently trade 2X their proportional share of the four-year block reward,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote.  It's not all bad news for the sector. U.S.-listed miner's share of the Bitcoin network hashrate rose for the fourth month in a row to 26%, a new record high, the report said.  The network hashrate rose around five exahashes per second (EH/s), a 1% gain, to an average of 621 EH/s in the first two weeks of the month, the bank said, noting that it is still 30 EH/s below the levels seen before the halving.  The hashprice, a measure of mining profitability, is still around 30% lower than the levels seen in December 2022 and about 40% below pre-halving levels, and this could slow hashrate growth in the near term, the report added.  The bank noted that the bitcoin price has dropped about 5% since the halving, but is still up 35% year-to-date and 104% year-on-year.

32484907,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24015,1723815997,How Does Mi Primer Bitcoin Plan on Expanding its Bitcoin Educational Efforts?,"Mi Primer Bitcoin is a nonprofit organisation, dedicated to providing Bitcoin education. It was originally founded in El Salvador, but has now expanded globally through a decentralised ‚ÄúLight Node‚Äù network in over 20 countries. This network empowers local educators to use Mi Primer Bitcoin‚Äôs open-source curriculum materials, such as the Bitcoin Diploma program, to teach financial literacy and Bitcoin knowledge locally, in their communities. The organisation is aiming to educate 100,000 students worldwide, supported by crowdfunding efforts via Geyser Fund that ensure its independence and adherence to core values. Through its decentralised model, Mi Primer Bitcoin is virally spreading global financial empowerment and education. Can Mi Primer Bitcoin Bring Bitcoin Education to 100,000 Students Worldwide? Mi Primer Bitcoin is a nonprofit educational organisation that began in El Salvador with the mission of providing comprehensive Bitcoin education to students and communities. Since its inception, Mi Primer Bitcoin has expanded its reach beyond El Salvador through the establishment of a ‚ÄúLight Node‚Äù network , which now operates in over 20 countries around the globe. These nodes are grassroots initiatives that utilise Mi Primer Bitcoin‚Äôs open-source educational materials, including its Bitcoin Diploma program. The Light Node network allows educators worldwide to bring Bitcoin education to their local communities, fostering a decentralised approach to financial literacy and empowerment. The organisation‚Äôs ambitious goal is to educate 100,000 students globally about Bitcoin. To achieve this, Mi Primer Bitcoin is leveraging its growing international network and the decentralised nature of its Light Nodes. These nodes are independently run by local educators who adhere to the core principles of independence, impartiality, community-led education, and a Bitcoin-only focus. This decentralised model not only ensures the quality and integrity of the education provided but also empowers local communities to take control of their financial futures through Bitcoin knowledge. Mi Primer Bitcoin‚Äôs efforts are supported through community supported crowdfunding campaigns, such as the one launched on the Geyser Fund Bitcoin-crowdfunding platform, which aims to raise funds to scale their educational outreach. The funds raised are crucial for maintaining the organisation‚Äôs independence from government and corporate influences, ensuring that the education provided remains impartial and true to its mission. By relying on grassroots donations, Mi Primer Bitcoin is able to continue its work without compromising its core cypherpunk values, even as it expands its reach to more countries and students around the world. The Light Node network is a key component of Mi Primer Bitcoin‚Äôs strategy for global expansion. Each node operates autonomously, contributing to a global ecosystem of Bitcoin educators who share resources, best practices, and support each other‚Äôs efforts. This network is designed to be resilient and adaptable, mirroring the decentralised nature of Bitcoin itself. By empowering educators to lead in their own communities, Mi Primer Bitcoin is not only spreading Bitcoin education but also fostering a global movement towards financial sovereignty and empowerment through decentralised education. A Grassroots Light Node Network Bringing BTC Education to the Masses? The ‚ÄúLight Node‚Äù program by Mi Primer Bitcoin is a fully decentralised and community organised, volunteer-run initiative designed to extend Bitcoin education globally by empowering local educators and communities. Each Light Node has been strategically placed in diverse geographical locations around the world, and represents a Bitcoin community or educational project that has been accepted into Mi Primer Bitcoin‚Äôs network, agreeing to uphold its core principles of independence, impartiality, community-based education, and a focus on Bitcoin-only instruction. This network allows the spread of high-quality, grassroots Bitcoin education to regions beyond El Salvador, leveraging the experience and resources developed by Mi Primer Bitcoin to support these efforts. A key feature of the Light Node program is its emphasis on decentralised operation and open-source collaboration. Each Light Node has its own personalised directory for storing custom content, resources, and sharing open-source educational materials. This setup not only fosters local adaptation of the curriculum but also facilitates a collaborative environment where nodes can share insights, resources, and best practices. The decentralised nature of the network ensures that no single entity controls the education process, aligning with Bitcoin‚Äôs own decentralised and permissionless philosophy. The benefits of becoming a Light Node are substantial. Nodes gain access to a global network of educators and resources, enhancing their local impact and recognition. They also receive direct support from existing nodes and participate in monthly General Assemblies, which provide opportunities for global collaboration, partnerships, and joint ventures. By adhering to the consensus rules of the network, Light Nodes play an active role in shaping the direction of independent Bitcoin education, contributing to a collective effort to empower individuals worldwide through financial literacy. In addition to the educational and collaborative benefits, Light Nodes are integral to the governance of the network. While Full Nodes hold additional responsibilities, such as voting on new Light Node applications and safeguarding the integrity of the network, Light Nodes are expected to uphold the values of Mi Primer Bitcoin, teach at least 50 students every 180 days as expressed on the project‚Äôs Github repository README with the ultimate goal of educating 100,000 students, and contribute to the broader Bitcoin education community through platforms like GitHub which allow for open collaboration. This structure not only ensures the quality and consistency of the education provided but also creates a resilient, decentralised network capable of driving global change through Bitcoin education. Mi Primer Bitcoin‚Äôs Humble Beginnings in El Salvador Mi Primer Bitcoin began its journey with modest roots in El Salvador, the country that became the first in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Founded by John Dennehy , the organisation was driven by the belief that Bitcoin could empower individuals by providing them with financial sovereignty and control over their own futures. The early days were challenging, with classes being held in unconventional spaces like yoga studios and cafes, and only a handful of students attending. However, the vision of fostering a deep understanding of Bitcoin among the local population remained steadfast, and through persistence and grassroots efforts, Mi Primer Bitcoin started to gain traction. A significant turning point for Mi Primer Bitcoin came through strategic partnerships with renowned Bitcoin companies like Bitfinex, which have been heavily investing in El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin ecosystem. These collaborations provided essential resources and support that enabled the organisation to scale its operations and reach a larger audience. Bitfinex, recognizing the potential of Bitcoin education as a catalyst for broader economic empowerment, saw Mi Primer Bitcoin as a key partner in our efforts to drive Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador. This partnership not only bolstered Mi Primer Bitcoin‚Äôs capabilities but also underscored the importance of education in the wider Bitcoin community. The philosophy of decentralisation, permissionless-ness, and grassroots community-based activism has been central to Mi Primer Bitcoin‚Äôs expansion beyond El Salvador. By adhering to these core Bitcoin principles, the organisation has been able to create a replicable and scalable model of Bitcoin education that can be adapted to different cultural and social contexts. The open-source nature of their educational materials and the decentralised governance structure of their Light Node network have allowed Mi Primer Bitcoin to extend its reach to over 20 countries, with each node operating autonomously while remaining connected to the broader mission of promoting Bitcoin education globally. This decentralised approach has not only facilitated Mi Primer Bitcoin‚Äôs rapid international growth but has also ensured that the organisation remains true to its mission of empowering individuals through education. By fostering local leadership and encouraging communities to take ownership of their Bitcoin education initiatives, Mi Primer Bitcoin has been able to create a global network of educators and activists dedicated to spreading the benefits of Bitcoin. The success of this model demonstrates the power of grassroots activism and the enduring relevance of Bitcoin‚Äôs core principles in driving meaningful social change.

32483529,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635939,1723813251,Bitcoin Risks Further Decline As Bearish Death Cross Returns,"A crypto analyst has unveiled a new bearish death cross for Bitcoin (BTC), the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is at risk of further price stalls before any potential upward movement. Bitcoin Prints Another Bearish Death Cross In an X (formerly Twitter) post on August 15, a crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòMags,‚Äô shed light on Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price movements, emphasizing key pattern formations and the cryptocurrency‚Äôs future outlook. Sharing a chart illustrating Bitcoin‚Äôs price action from October 2023 to August 2024, Mags observed that BTC has printed a bearish death cross on the daily chart, where the 50-day Moving Average (50 MA) crosses below the 200-day Moving Average (200 MA). Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Says God Candle Will Send Price To $57 The analyst indicated that the formation of this death cross signals a potential short-term weakness in the Bitcoin market. Generally, a death cross pattern in a cryptocurrency‚Äôs chart suggests the probability of further bearish momentum and price declines. According to Mags, Bitcoin‚Äôs recent bearish cross is the second death cross the cryptocurrency has formed since its price bottom at $15,500. He revealed that the previous bearish cross had occurred in September 2023, when Bitcoin was trading at $25,000, representing less than half of its current price. Following the 2023 bearish cross, Bitcoin traded sideways for several weeks, marked by considerable market volatility. However, the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price eventually regained momentum and reclaimed the moving averages. This led to a bullish cross, where 50 MA surpassed the 200 MA, triggering a strong upside rally. Mags suggests that Bitcoin is currently replicating the same death cross pattern observed in previous trends. He predicts that the pioneer cryptocurrency will experience a few weeks of ‚Äúchoppy price action,‚Äù followed by a bullish confirmation if it succeeds in reclaiming the moving averages. The analyst further anticipates a significant bullish cross, potentially leading to a strong rally for Bitcoin. Bullish Rise To $143,000? In another X post, a crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòMilkybull Crypto,‚Äô shared a more optimistic price forecast for Bitcoin. By referencing a price chart that tracks Bitcoin‚Äôs movement from 2022 to the end of 2024, the analyst drew a parallel between the cryptocurrency‚Äôs current market situation and certain events that occurred in 2023. According to Milkybull Crypto, many analysts had predicted a significant Bitcoin crash to $10,000 in 2023. However, the market defied these bearish expectations with an unexpected upward momentum. Related Reading: Prepare For Impact: Shiba Inu Whales Increase Their Holdings By 600% In A Single Day The crypto analyst has disclosed that a similar situation was presently unfolding in the market, with most analysts calling for a Bitcoin cycle top. He expects that in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024, Bitcoin will exceed all predictions, rising towards $95,000, before experiencing a massive surge to $145,000. As of the latest update, the price of Bitcoin is trading below the $59,000 mark. CoinMarketCap reports that the cryptocurrency had experienced a 4.32% decline over the past week which had pushed it to a current price to $58,484.

TeraWulf's stock price has seen significant fluctuations, with a breakout retested at $2.75 and strong long-term trendline support. TeraWulf's fundamentals show a strong balance sheet, rapid growth, and low mining costs, but valuation indicators suggest the stock may be overvalued. Bitcoin miners have been unbelievably volatile in the past few months, marked by a massively bullish phase followed by some really ugly selling. That's created a bunch of trading opportunities, but also a lot of risk. One miner that's seen the share price double and then get cut in half in the span of a couple of months is TeraWulf (WULF), a $1.2 billion market cap miner. I first covered TeraWulf last December, and the stock is up about 138% since then. I had a speculative buy on shares at that time, and in hindsight, it was in the early stages of a massive symmetrical triangle, which you can see on the chart. With about eight months of trading activity behind us since then, I have the same cautiously optimistic outlook on TeraWulf, this time at $3.60. Let's dig in. Breakout Retested = All Clear? That's the key question here, and right now, I think the risk/reward is skewed toward the bulls on the chart below. The symmetrical triangle I mentioned above had a breakout in early June right around $2.75, and that's the level that was hit in early August during the very brief period of panic we had in the market. Shares have exploded higher since then, so that's a very tradable bottom in my view. StockCharts It also happened to correspond to long-term trendline support, so that $2.75 level should be seen as a long-term critical level for the bulls to hold. Right now, I have no reason to think we'll test that low, let alone go back through it. On the daily chart, I like TeraWulf so long as it holds that uptrend line, which is currently about $2.90 or so, but rising quickly. On the other hand, August through October is tremendously bearish from a seasonality perspective for TeraWulf. Seeking Alpha Seasonality is a secondary indicator (with price being primary), but this is really ugly and not something I want to just ignore. That makes watching those levels on the chart even more important, and seasonality should be ignored at one's own risk. The Fundamental Picture TeraWulf is one of the smaller miners, but like others, is growing extremely rapidly as it scales capacity in the wake of the April Halving event. Investor presentation In the most recent quarter, the company boosted its capacity to 8.8 EH/s, which was almost doubled year-over-year. It mined the equivalent of about $450k per day in Bitcoin (based on today's price) at a power cost of $23k per coin. At $57k per Bitcoin, that leaves about $34k per coin to cover expenses not related to power costs, and of course, profit. The company held basically no Bitcoin on its balance sheet, which is a departure from some of the larger miners that are hoarding thousands of coins to take advantage of price increases from a balance sheet perspective. TeraWulf is choosing cash instead, and its cash balance was significant at $104 million. Net debt was negative at the end of June, which is outstanding. Investor presentation Management reckons it has the best adjusted gross margins in the business, with 65% adjusted gross profit margins in Q2. We all know margins are extremely volatile in Bitcoin mining, so that doesn't necessarily make a sustainable competitive advantage, but TeraWulf does seem to be fairly consistently enjoying low mining costs on a relative basis. TeraWulf is still diluting shareholders quite rapidly, which is common for Bitcoin miners, but it's something that holders of the stock need to be aware of. As TeraWulf issues more and more shares, your relative stake diminishes. Investor presentation I will say that the fact TeraWulf has fully funded itself through year-end is a positive, but the margin here is thin. Much of this depends upon its ability to mine and sell Bitcoin for favorable prices through year-end, so the price action of Bitcoin itself will (obviously) be quite critical. The bottom line on the fundamentals is that for now, the company has a very strong balance sheet with little funding risk. It is also enjoying strong mining margins thanks mostly to its low power costs. The problem is that it needs Bitcoin pricing to remain high to fund itself under the current strategy, and unlike some other miners, if Bitcoin pricing does take off higher, it stands to gain less given it has essentially no Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Still, all in all, TeraWulf's fundamentals look pretty good to my eye; it's just more of a pure-play miner than the companies that hold a lot of Bitcoin to take advantage of price increases. Valuation is in the Eye of the Beholder Tackling valuation is always tricky for a Bitcoin miner, but we have a few things we can look at to gain some clues. Let's start with enterprise value to sales, which is simply a measure of what investors are willing to pay for a dollar of revenue. TIKR This has moved around a lot in the past couple of years but has recently plummeted off the highs. At ~6.8X sales, the stock is certainly not cheap. Its average valuation has been more like 4X sales, with the 2024 low valuation right in that same area. On this measure, I'd say TeraWulf is somewhat overvalued. Now, let's take a look at TeraWulf's valuation against the price of Bitcoin itself, a favorite way of mine to value Bitcoin miners. StockCharts In the top panel, we have TeraWulf's stock price relative to Bitcoin's price. In the second panel, we have simply TeraWulf's stock price, and in the bottom panel, Bitcoin's price for reference. We can see TeraWulf's rally from that breakout point in early June was almost entirely a valuation expansion, not only from a price-to-sales perspective as we saw above, but relative to Bitcoin as well. I'd prefer to see moves up in the share price come from higher Bitcoin pricing - which implies higher profits - so this is not great. Bitcoin itself is also in a downward consolidation since the peak in March, so again, not particularly inspiring here if you're a TeraWulf bull. On this measure of valuation, I come to the same conclusion, which is that TeraWulf looks overvalued. The Bottom Line With all of this in mind - the bullish-looking price chart, what I see as favorable fundamentals on balance and the relative overvaluation of the stock - I'm still cautiously optimistic on TeraWulf. The weight of the evidence, in my view, suggests the risk is to the upside. I'm cognizant of terrible seasonality so that's a concern, but so long as that uptrend line is respected - currently just under $3 - I like TeraWulf going into year-end.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4715128-terawulf-looks-ready-to-move-higher-again?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32482984.jpeg

42417428,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYLy1,1723811012,Nigeria Court Freezes $38M of Crypto Allegedly Sent to Support Protests in the Country: Reports,"Nigerian authorities moved to freeze $38 million in crypto they say was sent to support protests against inflation in the country.  Nigeria has cracked down on crypto and Binance, the world's largest exchange, for allegedly contributing to weakening its currency.  A Nigerian court issued an order to freeze almost $38 million of the $50 million in cryptocurrency authorities said was sent to support protests against the rising cost of living in the most populous African nation.  The Federal High Court in Abuja issued the order to freeze four wallets allegedly owned by organizers of the #EndBadGovernance protests at the request of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Premium Times reported, citing a copy of the decision on Tuesday.  National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu told a meeting involving the Council of State convened by President Bola Tinubu that ""the government was able to trace $50m to crypto wallets that were made as donations to the protests. They succeeded in blocking four of those wallets containing $38m,"" according to Punch.  According to Peoples Gazette, the crypto address showed zero balance and had never been operated.  Neither Ribadu nor the EFCC responded immediately to CoinDesk's requests for comment.  Nigerians have been protesting against the rising cost of living. The country's currency, the naira, has been sinking against the dollar for more than a year. That's contribued to driving inflation to a 28-year high of 33.2%. The naira's woes have been fueled, in part, by crypto trading, authorities have claimed.  Earlier this year, the Bank of Nigeria Governor Olayemi Cardoso said crypto exchange Binance had allowed $26 billion of funds to leave the country untraceably last year, hitting tax revenues. That kicked off a series of events that resulted in the detention of Tigran Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen and a Binance official, who had been invited to the country for talks about the dispute.

ETH lost 0.7%, while SOL led gains, adding 0.44%. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, is about 0.39% higher. Bitcoin capitulated to under $57,000 late Thursday, a drop for which there was no obvious catalyst, given that both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were ticking upward at the time.  South Korea's National Pension Service has bought almost $34 million worth of MicroStrategy shares. Following the software company's 10:1 stock split earlier this month, the pension fund now owns 245,000 MSTR shares valued at $32.32 million, based on Thursday's closing price of $131.93. The purchase can be seen as an indirect investment in bitcoin because MicroStrategy is the largest corporate holder of the largest cryptocurrency. Earlier this month, Wall Street broker Benchmark raised its price target on the Michael Saylor-led firm to $2,150 from $1,875. Benchmark raised the target even though MicroStrategy missed its second-quarter revenue target. NPS also holds over $45 million worth of Coinbase shares.  The New York Stock Exchange scrubbed plans to list bitcoin ETF options, according to an SEC filing. The SEC extended its review period multiple times after publishing the NYSE proposal for public comment in February, eventually initiating formal proceedings in April. The proposal was withdrawn by the exchange before a final decision was made. CBOE, where a number of the bitcoin ETFs are traded, also withdrew its application, but has since refiled with a much more extensive proposal, according to documents spotted by Bloomberg's James Seyffart. The SEC hasn't provided public comment or feedback on the issue.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the recent flows and total AUM of the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs.  BlackRock's iShares ETF has recently eclipsed Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust as the largest in terms of AUM.  Grayscale's GBTC, having already existed in a different form for several years, had a massive headstart on the debuting ETFs when they listed in January, but has experienced significant outflows to its competitors since.

Generally, it is not very optimistic at the moment. The change of status quo, that is, DOGE going back to a strong bearish reaction, would require the market to change significantly. In the event that level of the market reaction is absent, then there may be a downward extension in DOGE price. However, if the coin tries to move upward, resistance would be spotted at $0.104 and $0.118. At the same time, the support accumulation zone is marked at $0.6243. Should DOGE succeed in having a bounce above these key levels, its short-term prospects remain uncertain. On-Chain Data And Holder Behavior However, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock was able to provide some insight into holder sentiment. The data showed that around 73% of the current holders of Dogecoin at current prices are in profit. In particular, 67% of these holders have kept their DOGE for more than a year, in other words, strong hands in the market. That, while the short-term perspective remains cautious, there is serious long-term holder confidence. Long-Term Potential And Forecast While the resistance continues at the moment, there seems to be a silver lining for DOGE‚Äôs long-term growth. For the next three months, CoinCheckup reports that DOGE is expected to increase by 114%. And all these potential highs can be supported by technical indicators: at the time of writing, both the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggest an upward course. With a position above key support levels and the overall crypto market remaining firm, this should translate to massive gains. Six months down the line, the outlook looks bright ‚Äì there can be growth of 61.58%. This is a medium-term peek into the projections for Dogecoin. Expected to be surging by 64.49% at the end of the year, indeed the demand for Dogecoin and compatibility with the progressive positive development taking shape within the cryptocurrency ecosystem will fuel growth.

Analyst Ryan Lee suggests that historical data shows a correlation between low gas fees and a subsequent increase in ETH price.  A steep drop in fees paid to transact on the Ethereum could spell a bullish sign for the network‚Äôs underlying ether (ETH) tokens, one analyst said, citing historical data.  ‚ÄúEvery time ETH gas fees drop to rock bottom has often signaled a price bottom in the mid-term,‚Äù Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, in Friday note to CoinDesk. ""ETH prices tend to strongly rebound after this cycle, and when this moment coincides with an interest rate cut cycle, the market's wealth effect is full of possibilities.‚Äù  Gas refers to the necessary cost a user must pay to perform a transaction on the network. Fees dipped as low as 0.6 gwei (a unit of gas) earlier this week with low-priority transactions costing only 1 gwei or lower ‚Äì a rare occurrence in recent years. The fees represent a more than 95% drop from the 83.1 gwei levels in March, when the network saw a spike in activity.  Lack of demand for Ethereum block space and a preference for using applications on other blockchains has likely led to the drop in fees, Lee said.  ""The drop in Ethereum‚Äôs gas fee prices to a five-year low can be attributed to the migration of meme season and Dapp interactions to other faster and cheaper blockchains like Solana and Layer 2, as well as the long-awaited Dencun upgrade that had improved the network efficiency and, therefore, reduced the gas fees,‚Äù he explained.  Dencun refers to two majors updates from March that changed how transactions were processed and validated on the Ethereum network. Since July, Solana-based application Pump has pocketed more fees than the entire Ethereum network in a single 24-hour period on a few occasions, most recently on August 13.  Meanwhile, the lower amount of ether (ETH) being burned due to lower fees means that the token‚Äôs supply has begun to increase.

Bitcoin is a strong store of value due to its salability across time, space, and scale. Valuing Bitcoin is subjective, but its network value is derived from the number of participants and total hash rate. This value has increased enormously over time. I believe Bitcoin has a place in everyone's portfolio, and understanding the underlying technology is critical to investing safely. Cryptocurrency is among the most controversial topics in the financial world. As the progenitor of the crypto asset class, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has garnered the largest following and the widest range of price targets. There are people who believe Bitcoin is worth $0 and those that believe there is no actual upper limit to Bitcoin's price. Then there are hardcore Bitcoiners that refuse to even price Bitcoin on a USD basis. In this article, I'll discuss my journey from skeptic to believer and explain why I believe Bitcoin belongs in your portfolio. Bitcoin as a Currency The story of Bitcoin sounds more fictional than anything else I've encountered in the financial world. A pseudonymous programmer launched an open-source software that powers a digital currency network during the global financial crisis. The token of that network, which has existed for only 16 years, goes on to appreciate in value more than any other new asset in history. Despite this, there is still widespread debate on whether that token actually has any value, how we ought to value it, and why we should even care about it. Believers say that this is immutable digital gold, which protects us from tyranny and currency devaluation. Doubters say it's the greatest vehicle for financial crime ever created and a valueless Ponzi scheme. Up until this year, I was a doubter. I heard about Bitcoin initially at $6,000 and made some decent money trading in and out of it, but never held it. I never researched the technology nor studied the nature of currencies. When revolutionary, paradigm-changing technologies are released into the world, the natural human reaction is first to doubt. Even the brightest minds in economics have had trouble gauging the impact of new technologies, like Paul Krugman with the internet: Snopes.com To make matters worse for Bitcoin, the whitepaper was only 8 pages. It was written in extremely understandable, simple language. It was concise, straightforward, and direct. This simplicity garnered further doubts; how could something so profound be described in only 8 pages of text? Yet, the whitepaper has stood the test of time thus far and the Bitcoin network has grown more robust. There are a few important concepts to discuss. Currencies are both stores of value, media of exchange, and units of account. Bitcoin is a unit of account as it can easily be used to price something in a transaction. The seller can request 1 bitcoin and the buyer can offer 0.8 bitcoin. In either case, the good being transacted is understood to have some value expressed in bitcoin. Next, what makes a currency better or worse as a store of value? The popular book The Bitcoin Standard presents a straightforward discussion of this. According to the author, Saifedean Ammous, sound money has three key traits: salability across time, space, and scale. Salability across space and scale are straightforward: is it easy to move across space? Gold bars are good at maintaining value, but it isn't feasible to travel with 20 gold bars. Bitcoin has high salability across space - all you need to know is your seed phrase and have an internet connection, and you can access it from anywhere. Salability across scale means we can represent different magnitudes of value using the currency. The US Dollar has a very good scale; we have a hundred dollar bills and pennies. Both are equally acknowledged as the USD currency, but they have much different worth. Bitcoin is divisible down to one millionth of a bitcoin, known as a 'Sat'. Network participants can price things in Sats knowing that those Sats represent the same intrinsic value as one whole bitcoin itself. Salability across time is the most difficult endeavor. This is the Achilles' heel of a fiat currency like the USD; it loses enormous value over time. Continuous minting of new currency devalues the existing base of currency, and the entity that controls the money printer has enormous power over the currency and those that hold it. Bitcoin has very good salability across time. As long as you have an internet connection, and you remember your seed phrase, you can access your bitcoin. The stock-to-flow ratio is very low, meaning the currency isn't devalued by the minting of new currency. The inflow of new bitcoins is very small relative to the base of existing bitcoins. Bitcoin has very good salability across time, space, and scale. It is fundamentally very sound money to store value, as long as you trust in the security of the network. The discussion then turns to money as a means of exchange, which is where Bitcoin is currently lacking relative to USD. Bitcoin has quite limited value as a means of exchange for now, but the underlying technology and infrastructure is being built to facilitate further adoption. In a future article, I'll discuss innovations like the Fold ((FLD)) Card, the Lightning network, and how payments actually work on Bitcoin. For now, though, suffice it to say that Bitcoin is fundamentally an extremely strong store of value that has limited utility as a means of exchange. If Bitcoin has extremely good utility as a store of value - why does it fluctuate in price so much? The price of bitcoin historically has increased over time as more participants joined the network, and I believe this is the best metric to gauge the value of the network, which translates to the value of bitcoin itself. As this initial price appreciation began capturing attention, it gave rise to speculation and trading in Bitcoin. People could buy bitcoin through a centralized exchange without worrying about actually holding or securing their bitcoins, and just try to buy low and sell high. Given bitcoins limited supply, new inflows can increase the price quite drastically. Huge price increases attract more inflows, and the cycle perpetuates. However, these folks hold bitcoin not because they believe in it, but because they are speculating on the price. Therefore, bitcoin is likely the first thing they'll sell in times of fear. This is what happened during COVID; when traditional markets began falling, crypto markets experienced a severe drawdown as institutions and retail traders sold their crypto first before other financial assets. Price volatility is of little impact to the value of the underlying network, so Bitcoiners recognize this volatility as ongoing opportunities to accumulate more bitcoin for cheaper. Blockchain: The Technology Behind Bitcoin Understanding why Bitcoiner's believe in bitcoin requires an understanding of blockchain technology. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million total bitcoins, of which around 19 million have already been created. Roughly every 10 minutes, new bitcoins are minted through a process called mining. Mining requires network participants to expend computing power and energy to solve a challenging puzzle. Once the puzzle is solved, other network participants check the solution and accept it if it's legitimate. If accepted, they move on to begin looking for the solution to the next block. This is known as proof-of-work. The difficulty of this puzzle is adjusted every two weeks based on the total amount of computing power present in the network, referred to as 'hash rate'. This puzzle is random, so bitcoin miners are essentially repeating a process of 'guess and check' over and over again until they find the correct solution. Accordingly, each unit of hash rate has an equal chance of finding the correct solution. This means that miners who dedicate more computing power to the network are more likely to find the solution and earn bitcoin rewards. Adding computing power to the network requires a fixed cost to buy the hardware and a variable cost of the energy required to run the hardware. As the total hash rate in the network increases, the security of the network increases. Equally important is the widely distributed hash rate; if one miner or a group of colluding miners owned more than 51% of the hash rate, it presents a deep security risk. This risk has decreased in severity over time because the price of bitcoin and existence of bitcoin rewards for solving the puzzle has attracted a diverse set of miners. Hash rate is distributed widely enough such that it's prohibitively expensive to procure enough computing power and pay for the electricity required to attack the network. Further, rejecting a block requires the successful mining of that block and the next block, meaning a miner that wants to change the blockchain needs to complete this randomized puzzle two times faster than the rest of the network combined. The incentive is always to participate in the network honestly and fairly. The more distributed the hash rate, the more security is inherent in the network. Block data includes transactions (in the form of a publicly accessible distributed ledger), the solution to the block puzzle, and a random unique value that is used to solve the puzzle for the next block. Proof-of-work, block mining, and the blockchain could be a full article series in itself, but more description is outside the scope of this article. For now, let's move on to valuing bitcoin. A Difficult Endeavor: Valuing Bitcoin With a solid base of blockchain technology and why it makes bitcoin a good store of value, the discussion then becomes how we value bitcoin. This entire section is a bit of a misnomer, though. I do not believe bitcoin can be effectively valued. For example, how would you go about valuing the US Dollar? You'd tell me that 1 USD = 1 USD. Its value exists in its transactability and network of participants in the USD system. USD is very good in this sense. You can go almost anywhere in the world and spend your USD. This is not true for Bitcoin. However, if I told you I'm saving $1 million USD in a checking account as my life savings, you'd call me crazy. It's not a good store of value. Bitcoin is. If I told you I was holding $1 million worth of Bitcoin at a price of $20,000 per coin, you call me a good investor. A different approach we can take is asking how you would value the internet. Would it be the cumulative market cap of all internet-based companies? Aren't all companies internet based in some sense at this point? It's a very difficult proposition to value the internet, though Metcalfe's Law presents a solid approach. The value of a network is the square of all nodes within the network. A node, within the scope of the internet, would be any computer with an internet connection. Using this, the internet has enormous, almost unthinkably large value. Note that this is not economic value, but network value. To further this point, think of how difficult it would be to create a successful business today without the internet. It would be nearly impossible. In the same vein as the value of USD, 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin. It is not yet a very effective medium of exchange, but it's a very good store of value. For now, then, we should discuss a valuation of bitcoin by how good a store of value it is. Similar to the internet, we can use Metcalfe's Law. This determines the underlying security of the network, which is derived from the overall number of network participants. As of the time of writing, there are roughly 19,516 active Bitcoin nodes. By Metcalfe's Law, this would be the value is 19,516 squared, or ~380 million. Keep in mind, this isn't meant to be the value of one individual bitcoin but of the bitcoin network as a whole. Further, it's not meant to be denominated in USD. It is most useful to gauge the value of the network over time. Another angle to view this from, is the total number of active mining rigs, since mining rigs determine network security. As of late 2023, there are roughly 3 million mining rigs. This is found by taking Marathon Digital's ( MARA ) 5% market share with 150,000 rigs. 5% of 3,000,000 is 150,000. Then, 3 million squared is 9 trillion. Again, I'm not suggesting the market cap of bitcoin should be $9 trillion. I'm suggesting that the Bitcoin network is enormously valuable, and the underlying token of that network is similarly increasing in value over time. The value of Bitcoin is entirely subjective and determined by market supply and demand. The inherent value of the bitcoin network is derived from the number of participants in the network over time. If we take a look at the total hash rate, it looks like a Bitcoin price chart: coinwarz.com As long as this chart continues this trend, the value of the bitcoin network will continue increasing and the price of bitcoin is USD will continue increasing as well. It may be a lumpy increase, but the trend will be up and to the right over time. The total hash rate and total number of participants will increase as better and cheaper hardware is made available, so I believe the hash rate will continue increasing over time. Therefore, I believe the price of bitcoin will be materially higher in 10 years than it is today. It is tough to pin an exact value on this besides ""higher than today"", but this is sufficient for me to store some wealth in Bitcoin. Investor Takeaway Discussing bitcoin and the value of the network is extremely difficult and can get very technical. I left out various extremely important details in this article for the sake of brevity and simplicity, but hope that this provides a general framework for ideating the value of bitcoin, understanding the fundamental security of bitcoin, and making the big decision to allocate some of your wealth to bitcoin. I believe Bitcoin is a Buy at almost any time, even all-time highs, for long-term investors. The network has overcome the difficult years of scaling from 10 to 100 to 100,000 network participants. The road ahead is easier than the road behind us, and I believe bitcoin will continue rising ever higher in value.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4715110-becoming-bitcoiner-understanding-blockchain-technology-metcalfes-law-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32481135.jpeg

Crypto ‚ÄòSupercycle‚Äô Imminent? According to OxNobler, the crypto market consistently follows a four-phase cycle: Accumulation, Markup (Uptrend), Distribution, and Markdown (Downtrend). The analyst argues that understanding these distinct phases is crucial for investors seeking to capitalize on low cap altcoins and market trends to maximize their returns. ‚ÄúWe are currently on the brink of entering the Uptrend phase, which is set to be fueled by a confluence of factors, including the upcoming US election, potential rate cuts, the global adoption of crypto ETFs, continued technological advancements, and shifts in China‚Äôs regulatory landscape,‚Äù explains OxNobler. Related Reading: Prepare For Impact: Shiba Inu Whales Increase Their Holdings By 600% In A Single Day Drawing on this market insight, the analyst has curated a list of six altcoins that are poised to experience substantial growth during the anticipated crypto super-cycle. These tokens span a diverse range of sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI), decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and more. 6 Low-Cap Altcoins Tipped To Skyrocket First on the list is Numerai (NRM), an Ethereum-based platform that allows developers and data scientists to experiment with and create more reliable machine learning models. With a current price of $11.75 and a market capitalization of $86 million, the analyst believes Numerai‚Äôs positioning in the trending AI sector makes it a compelling investment opportunity. Another altcoin highlighted is TokenFi (TOKEN), a crypto and RWA tokenization platform aiming to simplify the tokenization process and emerge as a leading player in the space.¬†Currently trading at $0.06 with a $60 million market cap, TokenFi‚Äôs role in bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance is seen as a key growth driver. Ravencoin (RVN), an open-source proof-of-work blockchain enabling the issuance and control of utility tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other digital assets, also makes the list. With a market price of $0.015 and a $223 million market capitalization, Ravencoin‚Äôs positioning in the growing DeFi sector adds to its potential upside. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Reveals Three Super Bullish Signals From Bitcoin ETFs The Fluence Project, with its native token FLT currently valued at $0.27, is another intriguing prospect. As the first decentralized ‚ÄúCloudless‚Äù computing platform, Fluence aims to provide an open alternative to the dominant cloud computing giants, aligning with the analyst‚Äôs bullish outlook on the AI sector. Realio Network (RIO), an end-to-end blockchain-based platform for the issuance, investment, and management of digital securities and crypto assets, is also included. Trading at $0.89 with a modest $5 million market cap, Realio Network‚Äôs focus on the RWA tokenization space is seen as a notable bullish catalyst for the analyst. Last on the list, is the largest altcoin among the six by market cap, Pendle (PENDLE), a protocol enabling the tokenization and trading of future yield, rounds out the list. Currently priced at $2.63 with a market capitalization of $419 million, Pendle‚Äôs positioning in the DeFi sector aligns with the analyst‚Äôs broader thesis.

The new platform will rival Solana's pump.fun token generator.  $10 million has been set aside to provide resources to newly issued tokens and a review process put in place to avoid rug pulls.  Sun.io, the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol associated with Tron founder Justin Sun, has released SunPump, a platform that allows users to create memecoins on the Tron blockchain.  The platform will rival the popular Solana equivalent, pump.fun, where transaction fees surged to an all-time high this week with a total of $5.3 million in 24 hours.  Memecoins, despite often being issued as a joke, have become a key part of the recent crypto bull market. Several, including SHIBA, PEPE, WIF and FLOKI, have surpassed a $1 billion market cap. One of the key criticisms of platforms like pump.fun is that it creates a cheap way for bad actors to create a memecoin only to perform a rug pull once investors have added value.  ""To address this, the Sun team is committed to enhancing our review processes, introducing community oversight, and promoting transparency to ensure the safety and trust of our users,"" Sun said in an interview. ""SunPump conducts a thorough vetting of creators and projects before they are allowed to launch on the platform, helping to ensure that they meet specific standards of integrity.""  When asked what sets the two projects apart, Sun said that due to a partnership with crypto exchange Poloniex, projects that maintain $1 million in daily trading volume for three days will be eligible to be listed on the platform.

32477812,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635921,1723798842,"Sovereign Wealth Funds Could Take Bitcoin To $148,000: Researcher","In the latest episode of the podcast ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin Layer,‚Äù Daniel Batten, a recognized advocate for Bitcoin, discussed the potential impact of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) on the Bitcoin price, predicting a rise to over $148,000 per BTC should these funds decide to invest even a minimal fraction of their assets. With $35.7 trillion under management between SWFs and public pension funds, a 1% allocation could have a significant impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs valuation. Batten‚Äôs analysis hinges on the sheer scale of assets managed by SWFs and public pension funds, noting that even a fractional investment compared to their total assets could have a profound impact on the market. He explained, ‚ÄúIf a 1% deployment into Bitcoin were to happen, we can calculate based on the current ratio of dollar invested to market cap increase that it would lift Bitcoin price to over $148,000.‚Äù Why Sovereign Wealth Funds Are Likely To Buy Bitcoin The primary roadblock, according to Batten, is not a lack of interest but a lack of permissible investment frameworks within these funds, particularly concerning ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria. ‚ÄúAll of the Sovereign wealth funds want to invest into Bitcoin. It‚Äôs not through lack of want,‚Äù Batten quoted Kevin O‚ÄôLeary, highlighting that these funds are currently constrained by their ESG investment committees. These committees are yet to be convinced of Bitcoin‚Äôs environmental credentials, which Batten believes are now significantly more positive than the general perception, marred by outdated information. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Reveals Three Super Bullish Signals From Bitcoin ETFs Batten suggested that the ESG criteria, which are a significant factor in investment decisions for SWFs, are based on data that is at least three years old, and no longer accurately reflects the current state of Bitcoin mining technology and its environmental impact. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a massive knowledge asymmetry where the knowledge that we now have about Bitcoin and its environmental benefits is now so different to what the ESG investment Committees of sovereign wealth funds believe about Bitcoin,‚Äù he stated. In response to these challenges, Batten has not only conducted research but also begun direct engagement with SWFs, aiming to educate and update their ESG committees about the latest developments in Bitcoin‚Äôs environmental impact. His goal is to realign the outdated perceptions with current realities, thereby removing the barriers to their investment in Bitcoin. Supporting his theory, Batten pointed to recent investments by state pension plans in the US, such as those by Wisconsin and Michigan, which, despite being small in scale, had significant media impact and positively influenced market perceptions. ‚ÄúWisconsin invested a total through Grayscale mainly. I believe their current position is around $160 million; that‚Äôs nothing compared to their total AUM [‚Ä¶] however, even that very small allocation [‚Ä¶] had a major impact on Bitcoin price that day,‚Äù Batten remarked. Related Reading: Crucial Bullish Signal For Bitcoin Flashes For First Time Since 2023, Analyst Forecasts Major Rally Overall, Batten believes that SWF‚Äôs can not only contribute to a Bitcoin bull run, but they can also help stabilize and legitimize the market for broader, more conservative investment audiences. Moreover, he believes that it‚Äôs more likely that WSF‚Äôs will invest in Bitcoin than having another major nation state or big company like MicroStrategy. He concluded, ‚ÄúYes there is a blocker and there is effort required to go through it and it is hard but it‚Äôs nowhere near as hard in my view as convincing a nation state to adopt Bitcoin. So this is an area where whilst it‚Äôs hard, it‚Äôs not as hard as other areas and it‚Äôs also that there‚Äôs only one blocker there‚Äôs not a whole bunch of them and in most cases that is the ESG investment committee.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $58,500.

32476380,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635810,1723795247,Is Ethereum Poised for Inflation? Supply Reaches New High as Staking Takes Off,"While Ethereum hasn‚Äôt been quite consistent with its bullish trajectory in the past weeks, its circulating supply has done the opposite. According to data from Ultrasoundmoney, ETH‚Äôs circulating supply has skyrocketed to over 120.72 million ETH as of today. Although this increase in supply is not straightforwardly negative for ETH, it still marks a notable shift in the network‚Äôs dynamics, fuelled largely by adopting Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake (PoS) model. Related Reading: Bigger Risks More Returns: Ethereum‚Äôs Volatility Surpasses Bitcoin‚Äôs by 50%, Data Shows Supply Increase, How And Why? The surge in Ethereum‚Äôs total supply to 120.72 million ETH, as shown in the data from Ultrasound.money, reflects the network‚Äôs increasing activity over the past month. In this period alone, Ethereum saw the issuance of 77,102 ETH, while 19,402 ETH were removed from circulation through a burning mechanism introduced in the network‚Äôs recent London Hard Fork. The net increase of approximately 57,653 ETH highlights a gentle uptick in the annual supply growth rate from 0.58% to 0.69% over the last 7 days. Notably, with Ethereum‚Äôs transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to PoS model, the network has not only achieved a major shift in security but has also increased the rewards for participation. Concerning the likely reasons behind the increase in supply, about 33.9 million ETH are currently staked in the network, generating substantial rewards in newly issued ETH. This large-scale staking appears to be contributing significantly to the increase in Ethereum‚Äôs total supply. Additionally, the staking process has been further amplified by the trend of restaking, where participants reinvest their staking rewards into the network. This restaking cycle creates a compounding effect on the issuance of new ETH, boosting the supply even as the network moves to a ‚Äúseemingly‚Äù inflationary trajectory after the initial deflationary expectations set by the ETH burn mechanism. Ethereum Market Performance So far, Ethereum appears to be seeing a gradual¬†price increase, from $2,500 last Thursday to currently trading at $2,652 at the time of writing, marking a 9.3% increase in the past 7 days. This surge in value coincides with ETH‚Äôs market cap valuation, which saw¬†a spike of nearly $20 billion over the same period. Despite this rise, ETH‚Äôs daily trading volume has seen the opposite. Particularly, over the past week, this metric has plunged from over $21 billion to currently sitting at $12.8 billion. Regardless of this, many analysts in the crypto space remain bullish on Ethereum. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Struggles to Sustain Gains: Is the Uptrend in Trouble?

The fund disclosed that it purchased 24,500 shares at an average price of $1,377.48, before MicroStrategy announced a 10-for-1 stock split in the beginning of this months. This brings the total number of shares to 245,000, valued at $32.32 million, based on MicroStrategy's last close of $131.93.  The purchase by NPS can be seen as an indirect investment in bitcoin {{BTC}} as MicroStrategy is the largest corporate holder of the token.  Earlier this month, Wall Street broker Benchmark raised its price target on the Michael Saylor-led firm to $2,150 from $1,875. Benchmark raised the price target despite MicroStrategy missing its revenue target for Q2.  NPS also holds 229,807 shares of Coinbase (COIN), worth over $45 million, based on Coinbase's last close of $197.12. The fund started buying shares in the crypto exchange in 2023, snapping up 282,673 shares at an average price of $70.5.

In summary, the token is down a massive 70% from March highs but is presently stable, following a stream of supportive fundamentals. A big part of the recent turnaround is due to a recovery in DeFi and capital flowing into the sector. According to DeFiLlama data, all DeFi protocols across multiple blockchains manage over $84 billion worth of assets. Though Ethereum leads, over $128 million of digital assets are tied to the interoperable Fantom Network reading from DeFiLlama. Sonic (Formerly Fantom) Appoints Andre Cronje As CTO As DeFi TVL stabilizes in the Fantom Network, though significantly lower than in 2021, attention has been paid to the change in leadership at Sonic (previously Fantom) Labs. Related Reading: Crypto Guru Arthur Hayes Bets On This Under-The-Radar Altcoin According to a press release, Andre Cronje, the founder of Yearn.Finance and an experienced DeFi developer is now the new Chief Technology Officer (CTO). The DeFi founder takes over from Quan Nguyen. Cronje will spearhead the design and development of the blockchain with a keen focus on building a new bridging technology, The Sonic Gateway. This bridge aims to ensure that Sonic is interoperable and users can move tokens across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum. Only time will tell how FTM evolves, looking at the development in the daily chart. As of mid-August, FTM is up 52% from August low. Most importantly, the token appears to be absorbing the selling pressure of the last five months. Impact Of The Multichain Hack, Efforts To Revive FTM And Sonic Ecosystem Following the Multichain hack in 2023, the Sonic ecosystem and FTM face challenges. The attack on the Multichain Bridge saw hackers make away with roughly $125 million of assets, a massive blow. With the community hit hard, Cronje said the Fantom team was misled about the security of Multichain.

The US government‚Äôs sale of $594 million worth of Bitcoin, part of confiscated Silk Road funds, adds to market uncertainty. A shift towards Bitcoin accumulation, especially among large wallets and long-term holders, suggests renewed market confidence. Double bottom pattern hints at a potential bullish rally. Will the range be broken? By Zain Vawda Bitcoin prices have been confined to a narrow range over the past week as traders exercise caution. While concerns about a recession have eased during this period, numerous risks still capture the attention of market participants. The range between $58500 and $61600 has remained solid, with yesterday exemplifying this stability. The leading cryptocurrency by market cap tested both the upper and lower bounds of this range, highlighting its current trading pattern and indecisive nature. US Government Sells Bitcoin Worth $594 million The US government has created a buzz as it moved 10,000 bitcoin valued at almost $594 million. It prompts questions regarding Washington‚Äôs approach to cryptocurrency and its possible effects on the market. The funds, confiscated during the shutdown of Silk Road, are in addition to a prior transfer of 29,800 BTC in July 2024, which was valued at nearly $2 billion at that time. With an estimated holding of 203,000 BTC, approximately worth $12 billion, the United States establishes itself as the unrivaled leader among bitcoin-holding countries. The excess supply entering the market could hamper Bitcoin and put a halt on any attempt at a bullish breakout. Hodling Makes a Comeback Another reason that could in part explain the range-bound nature of Bitcoin lies with the return to popularity of holding and accumulating rather than buying and selling. According to Glassnode, since Bitcoin reached its all-time high in March, the market has experienced a prolonged phase of supply distribution, involving wallets of various sizes. In recent weeks, however, this trend has begun to show initial signs of reversing, especially among the largest wallets, which are frequently linked to ETFs. These substantial wallets seem to be shifting back to an accumulation phase. *The Accumulation Trend Score ((ATS)) metric assesses a weighted balance change across the market. This metric also suggests there is a shift back towards accumulation dominant behavior. The aforementioned shift towards accumulation has contributed to the ATS recording its highest possible value of 1.0, suggesting significant accumulation throughout the last month. Source: Glassnode This trend is also seen among Long-Term Holders (LTH), who sold a lot of Bitcoin before it hit its all-time high. Now, they are holding onto their coins again, with over 374,000 BTC becoming long-term holdings in the past three months. This suggests that market participants are more inclined to keep their coins rather than spend them. It would appear that market participants remain optimistic following the most recent selloff. This ties in with recent reports by both Bybit and Block Scholes, both of whom stated that based on Bitcoin‚Äôs ratios during the previous cycles, the bull run will extend into the third quarter of 2025. Given that rate cuts from the Fed look almost a certainty in September and beyond, it bodes well for hodlers and crypto enthusiasts alike. According to Bybit, Bitcoin is in the second phase of its bull cycle, with some notable crypto analysts stating that the bull cycle is around 42.5% complete, meaning there is a lot more room to the upside. Institutional adoption and the launch of the ETH ETF have also been cited as reasons for the bullish rally and the hopes that it is not over yet. Technical Analysis BTC/USD From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin has been trading within a range of about $3100. After failing to gather enough buying momentum for a bullish breakout yesterday, it rebounded strongly off the $58500 support level this morning, reaching $59583 at the time of writing. Today‚Äôs low of $57717 has formed a double bottom pattern, suggesting a potential upward rally. However, there are several obstacles that need to be overcome for the bulls to regain control fully. The immediate resistance lies at the $60000 mark, followed by the range high and the 50-day moving average at $61600. The 200-day moving average is slightly higher at $62442, with further resistance around the 100-day moving average and the $63800 area. If the daily candle closes below $58500, it could lead to a retest of $56561 and possibly the psychological level of $50000.

32473510,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635860,1723788015,"Will Bitcoin (BTC) Trade Back Above $70,000 By September? Analysts Weigh In","Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) price continues fluctuating within the $58,000 to $61,000 price range following its recovery from the ‚ÄòBlack Monday‚Äô crash. However, analysts remain unsure about the next step for the flagship cryptocurrency. Some market watchers suggest the key levels BTC must break to continue the bullish run, while others highlight signals that could indicate a timeline for the next leg up. Related Reading: Dogecoin On Track To Rally 100% To $0.2; Crypto Analyst Analysts Unsure About BTC‚Äôs Next Move On August 5, the crypto market experienced a massive crash that shredded over 20% of most cryptocurrencies‚Äô gains. Bitcoin led the market with a 22% decline from its monthly opening (MO) of $63,000. Many investors feared that the bears had taken control and that the bullish rally was officially over. Since then, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has hovered between the $58,000-$61,000 price range, currently trading above the $59,000 mark. The recent price action has left some crypto analysts unsure about BTC‚Äôs next move. According to Altcoin Sherpa, Bitcoin has shown ‚Äúlots of conflicting signals‚Äù lately and is ‚Äúpretty neutral in the short-term.‚Äù To the analyst, BTC‚Äôs 200 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) in the 4-hour timeframe is ‚Äúacting as a stopping point.‚Äù Still, the chart looks like the cryptocurrency will return to the $56,000 to $58,000 support area. Sherpa considers that for a price surge, Bitcoin needs to reclaim the $62,000 resistance zone in the coming days. A break above this level could kickstart a rally toward the $70,000 level, not seen since June. Crypto trader Byzantine General described the recent performance as a ‚Äúweird spot where it looks like it‚Äôs gonna nuke the entire time, but it just doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù He suggested that when BTC exits this ‚Äúmini range,‚Äù investors will see an ‚Äúexplosive move‚Äù either way. Is Bitcoin Retesting $70,000 In September? Some market watchers pointed out a few indicators that could suggest the flagship cryptocurrency is near a price explosion. Rekt Capital highlighted that Bitcoin retested the support at the Descending Channel bottom earlier this week. To the analyst, the token has reclaimed the channel as it is still successfully retesting the $58,000 mark. Additionally, he considers that continued price stability at this level would benefit BTC‚Äôs ‚Äúfuture trend continuation to the upside.‚Äù Crypto investor Ted Pillows shared on X that Bitcoin‚Äôs Fair Value Gap (FVG) has been filled. Per the investor, this happened in the 2020 top during the COVID-19 crash and led to a strong bounce back. Following the FVG fill, BTC‚Äôs price took eight weeks to recover from the 2020 crash. Based on it, Ted believes Bitcoin could trade above $70,000 again by the end of September if history repeats itself. Similarly, crypto investor Elja forecasted that BTC might experience a big breakout in the next two months. Related Reading: Can The XRP Price Cross $250? Crypto Analyst Predicts 42,000% Breakout The investor explained that the flagship cryptocurrency has historically consolidated for approximately 170 days post-Halving. This suggests that Bitcoin has around 35-40 days of consolidation before breakout. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $59,730, a 1.4% surge in the last 24 hours.

According to Grizzly, the implications of such a move could see Bitcoin‚Äôs price retract to as low as $40,000, a major decline from its current market prices. The analyst particularly noted: Data shows that a breach below this [0.4] level often marks the onset of a substantial downward trend. If the index continues its downward movement, it‚Äôs reasonable to anticipate that the bears could take full control of the market. In such a scenario, the price could drop to around $40,000. Meanwhile, despite these ominous signs, it‚Äôs worth approaching the revealed data with a balanced perspective. Grizzly pointed out that the current decline in Bitcoin‚Äôs value¬†while concerning, has not yet escalated to a level that conclusively signals the end of its bullish trajectory. Historical data supports cautious optimism, as previous instances have shown that Bitcoin can rebound from similar positions, defying bearish expectations and sustaining its upward trend.

32468992,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635861,1723777222,The Ethereum Resurgence: Key Catalysts Poised To Drive The Crypto‚Äôs Comeback,"In a recent report, market researcher and analyst DeFi Ignas has provided a detailed analysis of the current bearish and bullish cases for the leading altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), offering valuable insights into the cryptocurrency‚Äôs prospects. Factors Behind The Ethereum Underperformance Ethereum has struggled to keep pace with its crypto peers over the past two years, declining 47% against Bitcoin (BTC) and underperforming Solana (SOL) by 6.8x since the market lows of early 2023. According to Ignas, the reasons behind this underperformance are open to debate, but a few key factors stand out. Firstly, the ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù narrative surrounding Bitcoin is easier for new retail users and institutions to grasp than Ethereum‚Äôs more complex story. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Reveals Three Super Bullish Signals From Bitcoin ETFs Additionally, the rising prominence of Solana, which is catching up to or sometimes even surpassing Ethereum in active users, transaction volume, and mindshare, has put pressure on the leading smart contract platform. ‚ÄúSolana is a riskier (lower market cap) bet on smart contract adoption, while Ethereum is squeezed in between,‚Äù Ignas explains. ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äôs modular approach with Layer-2 solutions has also led to a fragmentation of liquidity and a more complicated user experience.‚Äù However, the researcher remains bullish on Ethereum‚Äôs long-term potential, citing several compelling reasons to watch. Network Effects And Real-World Use Cases Efficient and Deflationary Network: If Ethereum‚Äôs gas prices remain around 20 Gwei, the network is considered deflationary and scalable, making it an attractive and efficient option for users. Decentralization and Security: Ethereum‚Äôs decentralization and security have attracted the trust of major institutions, including BlackRock, PayPal, JPMorgan, and Santander, who are testing blockchain settlement and tokenization on the platform. Mature DeFi Ecosystem: Ignas contends that Ethereum and its Layer-2 solutions boast ‚Äúthe most mature decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem‚Äù in the crypto space, with significant combined total value locked (TVL) and trading volume, attracting more users and driving up gas fees and ETH burning. Network Effects: Ethereum‚Äôs first-mover advantage and the largest developer mindshare contribute to its network effects, solidifying its position as the leading smart contract platform. Real-World Asset Tokenization: Ethereum is emerging as the preferred chain for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), with 52% of all stablecoins and 73% of all U.S. Treasuries currently tokenized on the platform. The Overlooked Catalyst? According to the researcher, another catalyst that few are discussing but that could have a significant impact is the upcoming Pectra upgrade, which is expected in the first quarter of 2025. This upgrade, which merges the Prague (execution layer) and Electra (consensus layer) updates, promises to introduce several key improvements, including Account Abstraction (enhancing user experience), staking improvements, and scalability. ‚ÄúThe market is underestimating the importance of the Pectra upgrade,‚Äù Ignas said. ‚ÄúFeatures like Account Abstraction, staking enhancements, and scalability improvements could be game-changers for Ethereum‚Äôs adoption and usability.‚Äù Related Reading: Tron Bullish Rebound At Support Level Signals Potential Upside To $0.1443 While trading at $2,670 as of this writing, VanEck‚Äôs ETH base price forecast of $11,800 by 2030 may seem bearish to some, Ignas pointed out, but it still represents a 4.4x increase ‚Äì significantly more than Solana‚Äôs 2.2x forecast over the same period. Ultimately, with a solid ecosystem, growing institutional support, and upcoming technical upgrades, the researcher notes that the bullish case for Ethereum looks increasingly compelling, even as the asset navigates near-term headwinds.

42390603,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4365,1723775400,What's Next in SEC v. Ripple?,"Last week, a federal judge ruled that Ripple should pay $125 million after finding last year that the company had violated federal securities laws with its direct sales of XRP to institutional clients. It's a fraction of the $2 billion that the SEC sought, and ‚Äì for now anyway ‚Äì ends the long-running case that began around Christmas 2020.  You‚Äôre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Closed case  The narrative  SEC v. Ripple is nearly four years old. Now it's over. Maybe.  Why it matters  The case was among the first major protracted ones between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a crypto industry player. Previous SEC cases against companies like Kik and Telegram ended relatively quickly. Ripple fought, and the results will be dissected as the industry looks at the SEC's ongoing cases against exchanges and other crypto companies.  Breaking it down  To quickly recap: The SEC sued Ripple in late December 2020, alleging Ripple sold XRP in violation of securities laws. The suit worked its way through the Southern District of New York court until July 2023, when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that while Ripple had violated federal securities laws in how it sold XRP directly to institutional clients, the company hadn't violated any laws through its selling XRP to exchanges which then made the token available to retail clients. The SEC unsuccessfully tried to file for an interlocutory appeal on portions of this decision, and in October it dropped charges against CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen. Last week, the judge ruled that Ripple should pay $125 million in fines and imposed an injunction against breaking the law in the future.  While it might seem it's the kind of ruling that lets both the SEC and Ripple claim a win ‚Äì $125 million is well over the $10 million Ripple argued it should pay, and is a small fraction of the nearly $2 billion the SEC sought, counting both last week's penalties and last year's ruling on secondary transactions, Ripple is the clear winner.  In fact, an SEC spokesperson did claim victory, saying the ruling contained ""significant civil monetary policies totaling more than 12 times the amount Ripple suggested was appropriate.""  ""As the Court found, the fact that Ripple has shown a ‚Äòwillingness to push the boundaries of the [Court‚Äôs summary judgment] Order evinces a likelihood that it will eventually (if it has not already) cross the line,'"" the statement said. ""The Court also addressed ‚Äòthe egregiousness of Ripple‚Äôs conduct‚Äô and noted that ‚Äòthere is no question that the recurrent, highly lucrative violation of Section 5 is a serious offense.‚Äô As court after court has stated, the securities laws apply when firms offer and sell investment contracts, regardless of the technology or labels that they use.""  The SEC did not say in its statement if it would appeal the July 2023 ruling.  Stuart Alderoty, Ripple's chief legal officer, said the ruling not only signals the end of the case, but ""because the judge continued to reject the SEC's overreach.""  ""[The judge] reminded the SEC, there were no allegations of fraud, there were no allegations of market manipulation, no misappropriation of funds, there were no victims,"" he said.  Patrick Daugherty, who heads Foley and Lardner's digital assets practice, told CoinDesk via email that while both parties lost motions they may want to appeal, the ruling on secondary trades ‚Äì which favored Ripple ‚Äì is perhaps the most significant.  ""It's a key loss for the SEC because it takes the wind out of the SEC's sails in other cases where tokens are trading on exchanges, especially if they've been trading there for years,"" Daugherty said.  Another attorney, who asked not to be named, said they could see the SEC appealing that specific portion of the July 2023 ruling, calling it a ""significant loss"" for the regulator.  About the penalties  The penalties themselves are fairly straightforward. The $125 million is something Ripple can easily cover, Alderoty said. Both he and the attorney speaking on background noted that the judge did not find any of the institutional investors had been specifically harmed.  ""[Judge Torres] found those parties got exactly what they bargained for, so one kind of has to ask why did the SEC put Ripple to the task of having to defend the suit at a cost of over $150 million?"" Alderoty asked.  That may lead to a bad precedent for the SEC, the other attorney said, because it may become more difficult for the regulator to argue for large judgements tied to registration violations in an effort to deter potential future violations.  The injunction the judge imposed is also unlikely to be a big deal. Alderoty called it an ""obey the law injunction,"" tied to the violation found in selling XRP to institutional investors.  Foley and Lardner's Daugherty said there's ""no real guidance"" in the injunction, which is a procedural one courts often impose. In this case, while the judge said Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity service may come close to the line of violating federal laws, she didn't rule that Ripple had violated the law with it or whether ODL needed to be exempt from registration.  ""Ripple Labs needs to avoid selling XRP the one way that the court held to be unlawful: as an institutional placement that did not comply with the requirements for an SEC registration exemption,"" he said. ""This means that Ripple Labs can continue to sell XRP in ways that do comply, either because the offerings are off-shore or because private placement norms are satisfied.""  Appeal?  If the SEC does choose to appeal ‚Äì or, for that matter, if Ripple decides to appeal its (less significant) loss in the institutional sales portion ‚Äì it'll have 60 days from the ruling's publication to file a notice.  It would be more difficult for the SEC to try and appeal any of the remedies ruling (the ruling that contained the $125 million fine).  Alderoty, the Ripple legal chief, said he wouldn't advise an appeal if he was working with the SEC.  ""I think the finality of the judgment, hopefully people won't be distracted by if the SEC is going to appeal, what happens if they appeal,"" he said. ""... even if they do appeal, I would just tell everyone 'take a deep breath.'""  The attorney CoinDesk spoke to said they would put money on the SEC appealing anyway, given the ruling on secondary transactions is ""bad precedent"" for the regulator. And while the SEC has taken a few high-profile losses in court, it's also had a number of equally high-profile wins, like the LBRY case.  ""I think there's an interesting perception where you talk to people and they're like, 'oh, the SEC is just taking one loss after the other,' and that's not necessarily true, because there have been wins in there too,"" they said. ""But I do think ‚Äì their strategy of 'everything is a security' ‚Ä¶ we're seeing major holes in that strategy that clearly doesn't seem sustainable.""  Should the SEC appeal, Ripple's Alderoty said the regulator would have a long road, given how rarely appeals courts overturn district court judges.  While this case so far has been a major win for Ripple, less clear is if it's also providing clarity for the crypto industry at large.  Christopher LaVigne, a partner at Withers, said the way court decisions have been coming out piecemeal are not providing real clarity for the industry the way companies have asked for.  The decisions that have come out from the courts so far haven't effectively moved the needle, he said.  Regulators are telling companies to obey the law, companies say they are obeying the law, and a court may rule in either direction.  ""Where does that actually get you?"" he asked. ""That's pretty much the status quo.""

An XRP ETF will undoubtedly cause new money to flow into the XRP ecosystem, leading to a price surge. However, it remains uncertain that such a fund can push XRP to such lofty heights. The likelihood of a Spot XRP ETF launching looks higher following the recent conclusion of the case between Ripple and the SEC. However, members of the XRP community will likely be cautious about getting their hopes too high about the launch of such a fund and the impact it could have on XRP‚Äôs price, especially having seen how the crypto token has performed since the lawsuit ended. The conclusion of the case between Ripple and the SEC was projected to be a catalyst that could send XRP to as high as $1 in the short term. However, XRP has shown no signs of reaching that price mark anytime soon, as it failed to break above the $0.6 resistance even after Judge Analisa Torres‚Äô recent ruling. XRP‚Äôs Bullish Breakout Will Send Price To $263 Crypto analyst Javon Marks has offered a more bullish price prediction for XRP, stating that a bullish breakout could send the crypto token to $263 based on the Full Logarithmic Follow-Through indicator. Related Reading: Private Investors Kicked Out Of Top Bitcoin Holder List, Here Are The Stats The analyst added that this bullish breakout is more than possible, noting that XRP is nearing the converging point of a near ‚Äú7-year consolidation/pattern development.‚Äù He added that the crypto token has also displayed multiple bullish signals, suggesting that this bullish breakout could happen at some point. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.56, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

32464600,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635812,1723766445,"Crucial Bullish Signal For Bitcoin Flashes For First Time Since 2023, Analyst Forecasts Major Rally","Bitcoin (BTC) is showing strong signs of an imminent price surge, according to top market analysts, who point to a confluence of bullish factors in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs favor. However, after hitting a 6-month low of $49,000 on August 5, BTC has hovered between $58,000 and $60,500 for the past week. However, the dip below all-time highs of $73,7000 reached in March of this year may be short-lived, as evidence mounts that the market‚Äôs largest digital asset is poised for a major breakout. 2-3X Bitcoin Rally Ahead? Technical analyst Jamie Coutts highlighted the ‚Äúfirst bullish regime signal‚Äù for his ‚Äúcomposite global liquidity momentum model‚Äù since November 2023, which could lead to massive gains ahead for the largest cryptocurrency on the market. In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), Coutts noted that during the previous bullish signal, Bitcoin rose 75% from November 2023 to April 2024 before the trend reversed, and BTC fell 25% from its all-time highs earlier this month. Related Reading: Tron Price Outshines Bitcoin: Can TRX Keep Momentum and Rise? According to Coutts, driving the Bullish signal is a surge in global liquidity, with the Bank of Japan and People‚Äôs Bank of China adding $400 billion and $97 billion to their balance sheets over the past month. Coupled with a sharp decline in the US dollar, Coutts believes this coordinated central bank action, likely with the Federal Reserve‚Äôs (Fed) consent, is laying the groundwork for Bitcoin‚Äôs next leg up. ‚ÄúFor BTC to meet this target, the DXY must be well below 101, prompted by ongoing central bank injections. This would push global M2 well over $120T this cycle,‚Äù Coutts projected, estimating Bitcoin could rally 2-3x from current levels. Comparing previous market cycles such as 2017, when BTC rallied 19x and 6x to 2020, Coutts claims that he estimates another 2-3 times increase, which would more than double the current high of $73,7000, positioning the Bitcoin price with an eye on the $177,000 mark. Growing ‚ÄòHODL‚Äô Trend Adding to the Bullish sentiment, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has observed that Bitcoin investors shift from distribution to accumulation. Over the past three months, nearly 300,000 BTC have been added to long-term holdings, a sign of growing conviction among HODLers. Currently, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $59,330, up just 0.6% in the last 24 hours, after hitting a low of $57,700 early Thursday. Related Reading: Solana At A Crux: Will SOL Crash To $120 Accelerated By These Factors? What remains to be seen is whether macroeconomic conditions will fuel another push higher for overall crypto market prices and whether BTC bulls can capitalize on this development, attempt to break above higher resistance levels, and retest BTC‚Äôs main obstacle at $70,000.
