42397511,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAYHr,1396799246,"The CoinDesk Mining Roundup: Solar-Powered Mining, DVR Malware and the 'Bitcoin Baron'","The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) has declined in recent weeks on the news that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had released complex guidance for digital currency users amid growing uncertainty regarding exchange regulation in China.  In the mining world, these price fluctuations can cause ongoing profitability issues, as miners, hardware manufacturers and price are key factors that impact the difficulty.  The incentive for people to mine varies with the bitcoin price. A high price makes mining attractive and people invest in costly ASIC rigs. The mining manufacturers then ship newer, more powerful units which raise the difficulty and mean more capital expenditure for miners if they want to keep up with the mining Joneses.  Then the price plummets, leaving everyone mining at high difficulty without the ability to cash in their coins at a significant profit.  The mining industry is pretty much held hostage to these realities. Call them bitcoin economic factors, if you will. Now, with that unfortunate news out of the way, let's see what's been happening since our last roundup.  The worst bitcoin miner ever  Bitcoin mining in the form of SHA-256 hashing requires serious processing power, and the higher the difficulty, the more power needed. That's why it seems counterintuitive to create ARM-based bitcoin mining malware.  Sure, recently discovered Linux-based bitcoin mining malware already seems like a bad enough idea, but the concept of ARM processor mining malware that can infect digital video recorders (DVRs) is just downright inefficient.  There is potential for lower-powered chips to mine bitcoin in the future, but that's only going to happen on smaller nodes of silicon that are using ASICs designed for that specific purpose. Anything else is just going to be a complete nuisance.  Also to be filed under pointless mining malware is the one announced on 25th March, that gets your Android device mining for dogecoins – veeery slooowly.  City-sized electricity bill for miners  Freakonomics  recently released a bitcoin podcast that featured venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and Stanford professor Susan Athey.  If anyone ever thought that bitcoin was a resource hog, take this comment from Athey as an idea of how much energy mining might use:  ""So it’s just burning a lot of electricity, enough to power many, many homes. I’ve heard estimates as high as 3 million homes could be powered with the electricity that goes to bitcoin mining.""  Athey's number for bitcoin mining's electrical consumption is just an estimate, but given ever-increasing network power, it's likely to end up being far higher than that.  As a result, technologies that can improve the efficiency of miners are going to become highly important, which brings us onto ...  Spondoolies Tech now shipping power efficient miners  Israel-based manufacturer Spondoolies-Tech has begun shipping units of its new power-efficient miner.  Called the Sp10 Dawson, this rig should produce 2.1 TH/s per kilowatt of energy, claims the company – a figure that Spondoolies-Tech reached by reducing the toggle rate of its 40nm ASICs.  However, Neil Fincham from Mineforman reviewed one of these units and found that the miner hashes at 1.49 TH/s. The SP10 Dawson does draw at less than 1 Watt per gigahash, though – adds up to 1388W while running.  The unit weighs in at 14kg, which gives it the heft of a regular server and means it needs to be housed in a proper rack.  Solar-powered bitcoin mining  Some people try to locate miners in places where there they can find cheap prices for all that power their miners will eat up, but if you don't want to move to Iceland or the US's Pacific Northwest, you could opt to go green.  Solarminer  is now selling a USB hardware product that the company says uses nothing more than sunlight in order to operate.  The device uses three 150W solar panels and 288Wh LFP batteries to harvest and store energy, and costs $889.  Solarminer customers do have to buy USB miners for the unit's 16 slots. However, there are a lot of different USB mining options available, and using something like, for example, the BitFury RedFury USB miner you could hash at 40 GH/s from one of these, just with sweet sunlight.  The 'Bitcoin Baron'  Wired recently ran a story on a couple of data geeks, Kai Chang and Mary Becica, that took the leaked Mt. Gox data and made a bunch of visualizations from that information. One user that stood out was referred to as the 'Bitcoin Baron' – a Mt. Gox exchange trader that mostly sold BTC at the top of every market peak.  The speculation is that the Bitcoin Baron might be a big-time miner, or perhaps a pool operator. Many (but not all) of those who operate large bitcoin mines or pools are hesitant to divulge any information regarding operations. But if this chart is true, it shows that big-time miners are always closely looking to make the best fiat profit that they can.  2.5 TH/s Bitfury Razz  BitFury, a chip manufacturer that claims it powers 20-30% of the bitcoin network, is now selling mining units.  The ecommerce site Bitfurystrikesback is offing the 2.5 TH/s 'Razz' unit, which sucks up 3kW of power for its hashing ability.  The Razz costs €7,250, or about $9,947. Interestingly, it is marked as a 'used' model, which would logically lead one to assume that BitFury has used these Razz units to mine prior to putting them up for sale.  When CoinDesk asked Bitfurystrikesback's CEO Niko Punin about the used status of the machines, he offered no comment.  However, Punin did say that there would be another version of the Razz for sale soon with even better specs.  1.2MW, liquid-cooled, bitcoin mining container  For those inclined to study data centre architecture and design, the concept of the modular container has been considered one of the best ways to pack servers into a small area. Google did it in secret for a while, and then Facebook open-sourced it.  Allied Control, which is a startup partnering with 3M on a special type of cooling fluid, has written a paper on modular bitcoin mining design.  It involves immersion cooling using six 200-240kW flat-rack tanks and is designed so that ASIC boards can be easily swapped when they become obsolete.  Each of these modular units can support a whopping 1.2MW of power. That is a figure that even Allied Control admits would not have seemed fathomable in bitcoin mining a year ago, but has become a harsh reality.

42397480,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAY09,1396793732,"European Bitcoin ATM Maker PayMaQ to Market €1,000 Models","A new line of low-cost bitcoin ATMs has been launched by PayMaQ in major European markets.  PayMaQ is pitching its PayBitcoin ATM as a more affordable solution for individuals and small businesses interested in hosting a digital currency exchange point. One unit costs just under €1000 after VAT and shipping, offering a retail cost savings when compared to $5,000 Lamassu units and $20,000 Robocoin machines.  The PayBitcoin ATM is PayMaQ's second model, following in the footsteps of a first version that CEO Luis Borrell acknowledged suffered from limitations, including the need for skilled maintenance on a regular basis.  The company has since turned to the development of a cheaper option that it believes is easier for business owners to maintain.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Borrell explained:  ""Nowadays, there are new people who want bitcoins and they need easy and nearby access to bitcoins. PayBitcoin ... is designed for any person who has a store, gym or similar business in which [they] can offer [it] to their customers buying bitcoins at the moment.""  The company is funding the project via Indiegogo.  Ease of use  The Bitcoin ATM business model seeks to solve a major barrier for consumers that want to start using bitcoins: acquisition.  As such, Borrell put the emphasis on the ease-of-use of PayMaQ's models:  ""This model of ATM can be acquired and operated by any person easily. Logically it has some limitations, but we think it is a good product to extend bitcoin around the world.""  Borrell sees the need for a simple way to get bitcoins as part of the process of broader market adoption:  ""Traditional banks charge 1-3% fees of every transaction with credit cards. People will be able to pay with bitcoins in any store, restaurant and in any business in general with no commissions or fees.""  First, however, customers need an easy method of exchange. And since Internet bitcoin exchanges aren't yet able to provide this service, Borrell believes his units will have a powerful value proposition.  Competition  The market for bitcoin ATMs is seeing more competition, including the launch of the Lamassu ATM earlier this year. Competition is also heating up in the UK and Southeast Asia, and with its low price point, PayMaQ could become competitive in the global market.  For Borrell, this means he also has to consider how his company will compete not just now, but down the road:  ""We have plans for the near future. We are now developing new solutions for stores, in a way that they will be able to accept payments in bitcoins. We are continuously developing new products.""  Part of this process includes the development of security measures for the ATMs. Borrell said that security is important but pointed out that the same risks face consumers who use other currencies as well.  ""For PayMaQ, security is very important. But we think that the bitcoin market is not different from the traditional market. We don’t see an extra problem in security – you have to implement security updates continuously. It is a part of our work.""  Rising interest in Bitcoin ATMs  Barcelona-based PayMaQ opened its doors in 2005. According to co-founder and Borrell, it originally sold payment systems. After hearing from customers that wanted to deploy ATMs, PayMaQ moved toward developing bitcoin ATMs.  A bitcoin ATM remotely syncs with an online exchange, allowing users to conduct fiat-to-bitcoin or bitcoin-to-fiat transactions and withdrawals without the hassle of creating a personal account and making an in-market purchase and with different levels of know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance.  PayMaQ's models are one directional and offer little in the way of compliance features, meaning operators who are able to cut costs with its units will have additional considerations to make to ensure their lawful use.

42397481,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAY18,1396790700,"The US Tax Man Speaks For The First, But Not Last Time","Jay Weill is a partner at Sideman & Bancroft in San Francisco representing people and entities in both civil and criminal matters involving the IRS. Weill was the former Chief of the Tax Division at the US Attorney’s Office in San Francisco.  Weill has co-authored this piece with Brian Klein, a partner at the litigation boutique Baker Marquart LLP and chair of the Bitcoin Foundation’s legal advocacy committee.      Death and taxes are the two certainties of life, so the old saying goes. On 25th March, three weeks before the US 15th April tax filing deadline, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) finally issued guidance regarding the taxation of bitcoins and other digital currencies in what the IRS, in typical IRS-speak, calls Notice 2014-21.  One could almost have believed that the IRS had forgotten about bitcoins and other digital currencies. But really, everyone should have seen this day was coming. Indeed, it was long overdue.  The IRS could have treated digital currency as either currency or property. It chose to treat it as property, imposing the general tax principles relevant to property transactions on those of digital currency. This means that digital currencies will be taxed as ordinary income or as assets subject to capital gains taxes, depending on the circumstances. The choice has far-reaching tax implications that will affect anyone who uses digital currency.  In the notice, the IRS co-opted FinCEN’s definition of digital currency:  ""Virtual currency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value.”  It goes on:  “The sale or exchange of convertible digital currency, or the use of convertible digital currency to pay for goods or services in a real-world economy transaction, has tax consequences that may result in a tax liability.”  This is very understated. The tax consequences are far-reaching and depend on how one uses digital currencies. The following provides a thumbnail sketch of certain tax consequences for US taxpayers.  Employers and employees  Employee wages in digital currency are subject to federal and state income tax withholding, and by law should be reflected on both employers’ and employees’ tax returns. Such payments are required to be reported to the IRS on your business and payroll tax returns and must further be reflected on IRS Forms W-2 issued to each employee and filed with the IRS. In turn, the employee must report to the IRS and state tax authorities the wages he or she receives in digital currency on his or her personal tax returns.  For each, the reported amounts – the wages reported paid or received and the payroll taxes withheld – will be calculated using the fair market value of the digital currency in US dollars on the date paid or received.  Independent contractors  Businesses paying independent contractors with digital currency must report amounts on Form 1099 – the document used to report other forms of income than wages or salaries – and supply the forms to tax authorities and their independent contractors.  Like employees, independent contractors are taxed in the same manner as if the amounts were received in US dollars. They must report amounts received as income on their tax returns and pay self-employment tax.  Investors  The IRS’ treatment of digital currency as property is a boon to taxpayers holding it as a long-term investment – that is, holding it for more than a year. This is so because when investing in or undergoing transactions in foreign currency, the gains are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate; whereas with digital currency treated as property, the taxpayer can benefit from the lower capital gains tax rate.  Moreover, like any other commodity, if the digital currency loses value instead of making gains then the taxpayer can claim a capital loss, which would help lessen the tax bill. The character of gain or loss generally depends on whether the digital currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.  According to the IRS, if the taxpayer holds digital currency as capital – such as stocks or bonds or other investment property – gains or losses are realized as capital gains or losses. But where such currency is held as inventory or other property mainly for sale in a trade or business, then ordinary gains or losses are generally incurred.  Miners  Taxpayers who obtain digital currency through mining must include the fair market value of the digital currency, as of the date of receipt, when reporting their gross income on tax returns.  This creates an enormous task for frequent miners who have to go back and see what the values of the bitcoins were on the dates they were mined. If the mining activities make up a trade or business, and the miner is not an employee, then the net earnings resulting from the activities constitute self-employment income that's subject to self-employment tax.  Exchanges  When an exchange sells digital currency to a customer as a part of a trade or business, its gross income will equal the value for which the digital currency was sold.  Catch-all for payors  Any disposition of digital currency is a taxable event, including the use of digital currency to acquire another asset, to pay for services, in retail transactions and investments where the merchandise received or investment has a higher value than the payor’s basis in the digital currency.  And, payments made using digital currency are subject to the same tax reporting and backup withholding as other payments made in property.  The character nature of the tax  The IRS notice left many unanswered questions as well.  For example, any person or business that receives more than $10,000 in one transaction or a series of transactions must identify the person involved to the IRS via Form 8300. Since digital currencies, like bitcoin, are not recognized as currencies by the IRS, does a car dealer have to report an automobile purchased with bitcoins?  US individual and business taxpayers alike should consult with their tax advisors about the implications of their particular digital currency transactions. They will now have to track their digital currency purchases in order to correctly prepare and file their 2013 tax returns due on 15th April, as well as potentially amend 2012 and earlier tax returns.  The IRS notice also invites comment from the public. Undoubtedly, the IRS will receive an extensive amount of feedback. In light of the path the IRS chose, one that requires extensive tax compliance efforts, the IRS should expect much of it to be extremely negative – and rightfully so.    __________________________________________________________    IRS CIRCULAR 230 DISCLOSURE: To ensure compliance with Treasury Department and IRS regulations, we inform you that any federal tax advice contained in this communication is not intended or written by the parties to be used, and cannot be used for the purposes of (i) avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Brian Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/06/the-us-tax-man-speaks-for-the-first-but-not-last-time,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3b18637c263b89e4cabf5d88ae2754c1a796e28-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397506,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbAYGs,1396778610,"Tax to the Future, Tip-top Tiny Top-ups, and a Free Gift for Bitcoiners","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 6th April 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most thought-provoking and most controversial events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of scepticism and wonder.      Your host … John Law.    Taxarama  No matter what Ed Snowden says, Americans don’t really fear the NSA. They don’t generally worry much about the FBI or the CIA. But every American ever born, including everyone in those three-letter agencies, fears the IRS. It nabbed Al Capone, after all, and has a reputation to match.  So when it speaks, everyone listens. And it has spoken on bitcoin: it is property, not currency, and falls under capital gains tax law. John Law doesn’t propose to go into the implications of this - already very well covered by CoinDesk’s analytic masterminds – except to note that under US law, you can offset up to $3,000 capital gain losses against general taxation, which may be sadly useful just at the moment.  However, the IRS ruling does bring up two intriguing points:  First, that to be truly compliant under capital gains law, the degree of book-keeping for all transactions can be truly horrendous for the individual. Imagine having to keep a running tally of market rates every time you buy a burrito or tip a blogger, or receive some bitcoin from a pal.  Second, because the IRS’s writ doesn’t run outside the US, bitcoin can be taxed as something quite different elsewhere: Bulgaria, for example, says it’s a financial holding, not property. Dealing with international taxation issues is quite bad enough without having the very nature of the thing you’re dealing with change across borders.  One answer for the first problem is that bitcoin is the first widespread native digital currency - and it is a de-facto currency, no matter what label the taxman slaps on it for convenience. It only exists in computers, and computers make very good book-keepers. The IRS could issue guidelines, even open-source code, for wallets and other bitcoin transfer software, that automate information gathering and delivery to IRS standards. It’ll be up to people whether to use IRS-compliant software, but the impetus to do so would be very high.  It would even be possible, John Law suspects eventually inevitable, for cryptocurrencies to have their own taxation regime. It is a unique invention. The tax system is set up around property and money, two things that have been around for thousands of years, so the problem of introducing an entirely new fundamental concept hasn’t arisen before. It’s a stunning opportunity, a green-field site in a system absolutely crammed with ancient and complex machinery that’s a nightmare to understand and administer.  The second issue is a similar opportunity to change the ground rules. The lack of international taxation standards is a serious problem for the global economy; it’s what lets multinational organisations avoid paying a large proportion of taxes in any regime, and supports an entire industry of well-fed specialists dedicated to legally hiding money.  Because bitcoin and its ilk are a unique invention that can be considered as such, the chance now exists for a standardised international taxation regime that doesn’t care - for collection purposes - where a transaction takes place. One set of world-wide rules would change everything.  Such thoughts are close to heresy, especially for the libertarian persuasion and anyone else who intrinsically fears world government and the intimate insertion of state apparatus into individual lives. They raise enormous issues of privacy, accountability, international politics and state power. But these are problems already, and at some point we the people will have to sort out how to fix the current messes extant in all these areas.  So, John Law proposes, now would be a very good time to start having these thoughts, and having them large. Let’s play what-if. Accountancy meets science-fiction:  ""Luke, I am your tax inspector …""  Well, if Darth Vader was to come to life anywhere, it would be in the IRS.  Paper chase  The Chicago Sun-Times now accepts subscriptions in bitcoin. It’s not that big a story as it stands - just an alternative way to pay for an old-fashioned paywalled block of access. As many have noted, the real game-changer would be with bitcoin-based micropayments, letting content providers sell pages of info for the equivalent of pennies or fractions of a penny. That could be finessed further: serve a page instantly for microcash, or let the punter see it for free after a second.  For cash-strapped journals, such ideas sound a lot nicer than the current choice of giving it away and trusting to advertising, or hiding your best stuff from the punters until they pay. And advertisers might like it, paying readers to interact with their content.  Social media services like Twitter and Facebook could create whole internal reward systems between readers and writers - voluntary, but if you join by putting a dollar’s worth of bitcoin in your account, you’ll get whatever rewards your readership generates. But could the bitcoin system stand up to the tsunami of tiny transactions such a system could generate?  Well, yes. A protocol extension scratches that particular itch by creating a trusted channel between buyer and seller that’s purely local and doesn’t convert to a full transaction until the channel is closed or a time limit is reached. An initial agreement is set up between the two sides and then incrementally changed as whatever is being microbought is sent over. When the session's finished, the final amount is calculated and committed. In effect, it caches the cash.  You can read a more technical (OK, OK, accurate) description, and the author notes the new system has been included in bitcoinj, the standard Java implementation. It uses standard bitcoin protocols and cryptography, and copes with vanishing servers and other annoyances.  Of course, a lot more work needs to be done to test this out in practice, create ways to let buyer and seller easily set up the transaction, and in adding the relevant magic to content management systems. Shouldn’t take long.  Based on the hit rates to John Law’s publishing empire across blogs, social media and comments, he calculates he’ll be able to retire from paid work sometime in 2056. If he types a lot faster.  And finally ...  This week’s free gift is the Advanced Bitcoin Simulator. It lives up to its name, accurately charting your progression in the bitcoin world from naive newbie to - well, you’ll have to play it to find out.  You’ll need a sense of humour, some experience of pointless computer games, an experimental streak, a degree of patience and the willingness to cheerfully survive catastrophe with remarkable resilience.  It may well be the most lifelike simulator John Law has ever experienced.  Have fun.  John Law is an 18th Century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.
