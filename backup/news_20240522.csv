XRP Price Roadmap to $20 In an X (formerly Twitter) post on May 20, Crypto analyst, Javon Marks forecasted a strong bullish breakout for the XRP price in this market cycle. Marks explained that XRP was steadily approaching a critical converging point, with an emerging Relative Strength Index (RSI) pattern indicating strong underlying momentum for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Pour $942 Million Into Bitcoin, Will This Trigger A Rally To $80,000? An RSI is a technical tool used to measure the speed and change of price movements in a cryptocurrency. It is also used to determine the short-term momentum of a cryptocurrency’s market. Sharing a price chart depicting the XRP price movements from 2018 to 2025, the analyst predicts that XRP’s closing converging point and RSI pattern are signaling a massive breakout to new all-time highs. He has projected a “conservative” target that could see XRP’s price soaring between $15 and $20 in the coming weeks. Additionally, XRP’s present price actions are displaying a bullish pattern reminiscent of the one observed during its mega rally to a new all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. Marks noted that for XRP to reach the ambitious $20 price target, the cryptocurrency would have to witness a massive surge of 2,000% to 3,000%, translating to 20X to 36X from its current price. Concluding his analysis, the crypto analyst disclosed that all the factors and indicators were pointing towards a potential rise in XRP’s price. However, the exact timing of when this will occur is uncertain. More Bullish Projections For XRP XRP has been drawing significant attention from market analysts, who are projecting increasingly bullish price movements for the cryptocurrency. Despite its struggles to reach the coveted $1, the XRP price has still exhibited some strength as it continues to maintain a price position around the $0.5 mark. Related Reading: Crypto Market Liquidations Top $330 Million In 24 Hours With Ethereum In The Lead Prominent XRP supporter and crypto analyst identified as ‘JackTheRippler,’ on X predicts that XRP is poised for an explosive rally after years of accumulation. Sharing a price chart illustrating XRP’s price action from 2017 to 2024, the crypto analyst revealed indicators that suggested a potential rise to new highs. Another XRP community member and crypto analyst identified as ‘XRP Captain,’ has also confirmed a potential breakout for the cryptocurrency. He disclosed that XRP’s next target will likely be $0.7 before June 2024. At the time of writing, XRP’s price is trading at $0.53, marking a decline of 1.06% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Over the past seven days, the cryptocurrency has performed relatively well, recording a series of minor rallies that contributed to a 6.67% gain. A bullish breakout for XRP will require sustained momentum and increased trading activities from investors. Currently, the cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume has not demonstrated significant growth, indicating only a slight increase of 3.25% in the last 24 hours.

Black Phoenix, a payment system protocol, and its native token, BPX, have witnessed an astonishing surge in price, outperforming the entire market with historical performance. Notably, Black Phoenix’s BPX token reached an all-time high of $2.60 on May 22, propelled by a staggering 4,400,000% growth in the past 24 hours and over 6,500,000% in the past fourteen days. This unexpected victory has caught the attention of investors, prompting them to examine the protocol’s underlying principles and design more closely. Exploring The Black Phoenix Design According to the protocol’s “Black Paper” released in April 2021, Black Phoenix presents a fully on-chain liquidity protocol for instant cryptocurrency token swaps in a decentralized manner on any smart contract-enabled blockchain. The protocol’s design aggregates liquidity within each blockchain, claiming to offer “the best rates” for takers executing trades. Additionally, Black Phoenix envisions a connected liquidity network facilitating seamless cross-chain token swaps across its networks on different chains, with its token based on the Tron (TRX) blockchain. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Can’t Reach $0.01, Crypto Pundit Reveals Why To implement a distributed infrastructure services economy, Black Phoenix introduced its native token BPX. BPX aims to eliminate “inefficiencies” in the existing protocol and attract a broad user base, ultimately creating a marketplace for distributed infrastructure services. Black Phoenix’s long-term and short-term goals revolve around achieving reputable exchange listings, increasing the token’s value, and expanding the user base. Currently, BPX tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Black Phoenix is FameEX, where the most active trading pair BPX/USDT has a trading volume of $2,809,201 in the last 24 hours, which has been the propeller of the current uptrend. Nevertheless, Black Phoenix plans to list the BPX token on several exchanges, including Hotbit, Hitbtc, Coinex, Binance, and Coinbase Pro. Trading Volume Skyrockets 2,800,000% One key indicator of Black Phoenix’s recent success is the increase in trading volume. CoinGecko data shows a significant spike in trading volume for BPX on Wednesday, reaching 2,800,000%. At the same time, Black Phoenix’s market capitalization has risen to $3.8 billion, a significant increase from $29 million in hours. The fully diluted valuation (FDV) is a statistical representation of the maximum market capitalization an asset can achieve, assuming that all available tokens are in circulation. For Black Phoenix, the FDV currently stands at an impressive $10.4 billion. This valuation represents the potential growth and market cap of BPX if all 4 billion tokens were in circulation. Following the notable surge in all key metrics for BPX, the project’s team has made a bold prediction, stating that BPX will soon become one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the world. Related Reading: Built On An $6 Million NFT Scam? AI Company Accused Of Fraud By Internet Investigator Ultimately, the potential listing of Black Phoenix’s token on top exchanges promises to propel its upward trend further.

42418092,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcbm9,1716414335,The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act Is a Watershed Moment for Our Industry,"The passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) by the U.S. House of Representatives is a major milestone for the digital asset industry. As head of the Blockchain Association, the leading trade group representing this sector, I’m heartened to see such strong bipartisan support for attempting to codify clear rules that aim to enable responsible innovation while protecting consumers.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. Kristin Smith is CEO of the Blockchain Association, the Washington DC-based trade association representing crypto.  For too long, the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States has been an untenable, muddled mess. Different federal agencies have asserted conflicting jurisdiction, creating confusion and uncertainty in the marketplace. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken advantage of this precarious situation, supercharging a campaign of intimidation and enforcement that threatens the viability of crypto in the U.S.  This has led to further uncertainty, expensive legal battles and the risk of the U.S. falling behind other regions such as the European Union in fostering a vibrant, homegrown crypto landscape.  The status quo is simply not working for anyone – not companies building innovative new products and services, not investors, and certainly not consumers. It was time for Congress to step in, reclaim its rightful place as the engine room of economic policymaking, and draft a modern, fit-for-purpose regulatory framework.  While the legislation should be further refined as it moves to the Senate, FIT21 represents a notable step in the right direction. It acknowledges the fundamental promise of crypto and blockchain technology and endeavors to promote innovation while protecting consumers. This legislative approach of balancing those key priorities is exactly what our industry has been advocating. It’s also what consumers are demanding.  We commend the efforts of House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) who spearheaded this legislation. They dedicated months of work, consistently engaging with industry stakeholders, including with Blockchain Association member companies, to understand the key issues and try to get the framework right.  While FIT21 isn't perfect – no bill is – we will continue advocating for productive changes. Today’s vote represents undeniable forward progress on the path to a rational policy environment that unlocks clarity for digital assets in the United States. After the difficulties of 2022, it is gratifying to see elected leaders champion this critical technology that a growing number of Americans want their government to support, or at the very least not impede.  The House vote reaffirms crypto's growing political momentum, following positive developments such as the recent bipartisan congressional repeal of SAB121, the SEC's misguided and illegal accounting guidance. A recent poll shows large and growing factions of the American electorate want to elect politicians that understand crypto and are willing to respect and support the technology's growth in the U.S.  See also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis) | Opinion  And crypto may yet become a live issue in the upcoming presidential race, with former President Trump recently embracing the technology with an explicit ask for support.  As FIT21 advances to the Senate, Blockchain Association and our members will remain constructively engaged, advocating for smart policies that foster responsible innovation and, most of all, protect consumers.

42418101,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcbxV,1716414122,U.S. House Approves Crypto FIT21 Bill With Wave of Democratic Support,"The U.S. House vote goes279-136to approve the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act with a very strong showing from House Democrats.  The passage of the crypto market-structure bill marks the industry's most significant legislative accomplishment in Congress.  The crypto industry recorded its biggest-ever U.S. policy win on Wednesday when the House of Representatives approved a wide-reaching bill to establish regulations for digital assets markets, recording a 279-136 vote that saw Democrats crossing party lines to support it.  Latest News: U.S. House Passes Bill Banning Federal Reserve From Issuing a CBDC  The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) marks the first time a major crypto bill has cleared one of the chambers of Congress. The issue now heads to the U.S. Senate, where its future is much murkier, because there's no counterpart bill. Support for such an effort remains unclear there, and the necessary committees haven't done the same level of work on crypto.  The U.S. has fallen behind other global jurisdictions in establishing crypto regulations, and despite the win on Wednesday, implementing such oversight is far from complete.  ""We need rules of the road,"" said Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), one of the Democrats who bucked the opposition of the White House and the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). He called it ""well-reasoned, thoughtful, bipartisan legislation"" and argued before the vote that ""it's fit to become law if we work together.""  Overall, 71 Democrats and 208 Republicans voted in favor of the bill, versus 3 Republicans and 133 Democrats who voted against.  President Joe Biden opposed the bill with a policy statement, though he didn't say he'd veto the bill, as he had recently when Congress sought to overturn a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) effort to set crypto accounting policy. SEC Chair Gary Gensler also came out strongly against the legislation in a lengthy public statement arguing the bill wasn't needed and endangered existing securities regulations.  The legislation – largely driven by House Republicans – would establish a regime to regulate the U.S. crypto markets, setting consumer protections, installing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a leading regulator of digital assets and the watchdog of the non-securities spot markets and it would more clearly define what makes a crypto token a security or a commodity.  Waters argued that the bill is seeking to let the crypto businesses who have been dodging securities laws avoid responsibility.  ""They have already made billions of dollars unlawfully issuing or facilitating the buying and selling of crypto securities,"" Waters said. ""And Republicans are now proposing to reward these illegal activities by making these activities legal.""  Prior to Wednesday afternoon's vote, the House debated a handful of amendments to the bill, including by Reps. Greg Casar (D-Texas), Brittany Pettersen (D-Co.), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) and Scott Perry (R-Pa.). Casar's amendment to change a crowdfunding exemption from $75 million to $5 million was defeated, but the rest were adopted.

42418097,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcbtN,1716412742,Audrey Tang: Learning From Taiwan’s Digital Civic Experimentation,"A new political philosophy has entered the chat.  “Plurality,” the title and central subject of a new book by Microsoft’s internal economist Glen Weyl and Taiwan’s former (as of yesterday) Minister of Digital Affairs Audrey Tang, is the idea that collaboration-enhancing technologies should be more widely embraced both by the public and state. Societies should learn to cherish a wider range of viewpoints, the authors argue, and one of the ways to foster that state of mind is through technologies – perhaps blockchains – that enable us to come together.  The book is essentially a coda to Tang’s career as a public servant as well as an outgrowth of Weyl’s previous techno-political theory meant to counter the malaise overtaking a world beset by wealth inequality and economic stagnation, laid out in “Radical Markets.” Tang, who entered public office to help advance Taiwan’s digital developments in 2016 (and was appointed its first digital minister in 2022), stepped down on Monday to go on a world tour to speak about the theory of Plurality and educate politicians on Taiwan’s groundbreaking civic digital experiments.  You may be asking yourself how it is that advocating for a diversity of opinions, healthy civic debate and technology is a novel political strategy. And you’d be right! But what sets Plurality apart is Tang’s tangible experience running large scale, open-source, public, digital infrastructure projects like the g0v project (pronounced Gov Zero), which created open source and interactive alternatives of Taiwan’s government websites, and vTaiwan, which enabled citizens to petition for policies.  In other words, there is praxis to Tang and Weyl’s theory – a goal in action. Weyl has described Plurality as something similar to environmentalism; it only works if you do it. The dream is to get the whole world on-boarded onto this system, advancing democracy and open-source technological innovation simultaneously. The book itself is a working example of Plurality: written collaboratively with a number of co-authors, the book is freely available to all (here) and something they hope to add to over time.  See also: Changemaker: Glen Weyl Puts His Radical Ideas Into Action  “Our project will be carried out in conjunction with Plurality research and implementation,” Tang and Weyl write in an announcement post. “We don't just need hackers and writers, we need designers, storytellers, marketers and distributors to work with us. Under no circumstances will Glen and Audrey receive any compensation or royalties for writing this book, in keeping with the legal code that accompanies their positions; revenue will only be used to support the community and philanthropic mission we hope to build.”  CoinDesk caught up with Tang (who by all accounts has had a fascinating life, which was detailed yesterday in a TIME profile and will soon be the subject of a documentary) to discuss the writing of the book, how to convince governments to embrace progressive technology and what it means to be a “good enough ancestor.”  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  To start off with an easy one: What was it like writing a book with Glen Weyl?  So the book actually started two years ago even before I was appointed as minister of digital affairs. So in a sense, it grew with the ministry. As you understand, our ministry got started when the unprovoked war on Kyiv happened, when people suddenly started to care about resilience. And so a lot of the ideas from the book, like IPFS, decentralization and Web3 for redundancy, suddenly became a topic of focus when our ministry first started a year and a half ago.  I think it's both very practical that those cutting edge ideas get used in Taiwan, and also highly enjoyable in the sense that people care about Taiwan. But they may not know how a civic tech ecosystem functions or how the state can fund a lot of decentralized technology as public infrastructure in the same way it builds highways and bridges.  There was a lot of mutual learning. I would also point out that as a result of co-writing this book, both Vitalik Buterin and Glen have become residents of Taiwan. They got gold cards, which we hand out for anyone who contributes for 8 years or more to open source or any of the internet commons.  For people who would hear the gist of the book and assume that it's another form of technical libertarianism, could you describe exactly what you mean by “plurality?”  Sure, so plurality means collaborative diversity, right? It means technology that fosters diversity. So in that sense, it is a little bit similar to the idea of decentralization where everybody can host their own systems. But there's another dimension of effective collaboration and coordination, which we loosely refer to as democracy but it's not about just voting. It is about a continuous form of democracy that allows, for example, AI facilitated deliberation between people holding very conflicting ideas to build bridges for people who were originally ideologically opposed.  See also: CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger on Overzealous Crypto Regulation and the Need for Legislative Action  I would say this form of collaboration sounds a little bit technocratic, that diversity sounds a little bit libertarian, but it is a unique combination of the two – collaborative diversity – that sets plurality apart.  So I liked the book. It was a love letter to Taiwan in some sense, but how would you best persuade governments outside of Taiwan to adopt these democratic experimentations?  Well, first of all, I think we learn from a lot of other governments as well. Our reputation system came from Reykjavik, Iceland. Our participatory budget system came from Barcelona. And of course, we were inspired by the internet consultation in Brazil from more than 10 years ago. And so there's a long tradition of working with internet technologies, not for the government to govern the internet, but using internet technologies to improve the governance of government itself.  What Taiwan can contribute here is that we have advanced some of the more, I would say, resilient defenses against polarization attacks, you know, information manipulation attacks, deep fakes, transnational fraud and pandemic misinformation – you name it. For example, we've managed to overcome the polarization tied to our January election, without people hating each other.  That's partly thanks to participatory fact checking, where we set up a community with 1000s of contributors and music to spread the idea of super fact checking. So as you can see, in any jurisdiction where there are similar threats or a similar urgency for clarity, these ideas take hold and the grassroots community just grows from there.  Just off of the idea of crowdsourcing truth. X has a version of it. Do you think these different programs are better run by the government or by private corporations?  Yeah, I think that the greatest thing about Community Notes is that it really is open source. I remember Vitalik set up his own node to verify what x.com did was correct. So because it's open source, you can think of it as a layer. Imagine, not just for x.com, but for anybody in the fedi-verse where you can conceivably you can build a Community Notes, including Threads and other things, and in a sense making this not just a jury duty of sorts, but rather making it a alternate entry point where the Committee Notes are the default for the various different social platforms.  So to your question, I see it working as a bridging system across different social networks and that the state should fund it, of course, but not control it. This is in a sense like funding running water for civil discourse, because if there is no such layer, then polarization is the default for the current generation of the social web.  Responding to some of the like blockchain critics, how can the blockchain world help devise protocols that look more plural pluralistic rather than plutocratic?  I think a healthy ecosystem in the blockchain world is one that is not dominated by a single implementation, right? So of course Ethereum itself has multiple implementations and also on different layer 2 solutions. I have in mind, for example, the Polkadot system, which is a distinct ecosystem, building on a kind of common meta-protocol. We need to get people to better understand that crypto really follows a toolkit approach, like the fact that you can reuse most of the governance protocols and enjoy cross-chain coordination. I think this is something that we in traditional politics find it difficult to imagine.  Of course, there are things like gold cards that give people residency across multiple jurisdictions that kind of approximate this, but it is still not as nimble or mobile as, for example, Gitcoin is as far as that can identify people across multiple social presences. These examples serve as a very important proof of concept. So that when new governments start looking at quadratic voting, project funding and all sorts of ways coordination could be more thorough, they can point to those already working on-chain examples and say, “oh, let's just copy that” instead of doing research from scratch.  So the Daily Beast wrote a piece saying that some of Taiwan's civil tech experimentations are seeing decreasing use.  Yeah, they decreased during the pandemic. That is true.  I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond because I don’t think I saw a quote from you.  I think it's up to the vTaiwan community to explain what happened during the pandemic and what happened after. If you want a quote, actually, because the Plurality book is co-written with them, you can just read their account  Chapter 2-2, has a very comprehensive response, saying that, and I quote, “As a decentralized, citizen-led community, vTaiwan is also a living organism that naturally evolves and adapts as citizen volunteers participate in various ways. The community’s engagement experienced a downturn following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which interrupted face-to-face meetings and led to decreased participation. The platform faced challenges due to the intensive volunteering effort required, the absence of mandates for governmental responses, and its somewhat narrow focus. In response to these challenges, vTaiwan’s community has sought to find a new role between the public and the government and extend its outreach beyond the realm of Taiwanese regulation in recent years. A significant effort to revitalize vTaiwan was its collaboration with OpenAI’s Democratic Input to AI project in 2023. Through partnerships with Chatham House and the organization of several physical and online deliberative events centered on the topic of AI ethics and localization, vTaiwan successfully integrated local perspectives into the global discourse on AI and technology governance.”  Then the next paragraphs say that today a second, related platform, Join, averages about more than 11,000 unique daily visitors. So while the state e-petition platform enjoyed slightly increasing participation during the pandemic because of the ease of online voting, vTaiwan’s reliance on weekly face to face meetups did experience that downturn, but now they're on a bounce back.  So in a sense, you’re saying there was a natural evolution of people moving to different platforms, like the shift from MySpace to Facebook?  I think the good thing about g0v [pronounced Gov-Zero] is that every project is by definition open source and part of Creative Commons. And so for new generations who want to revitalize vTaiwan, they do not have to start from scratch.  See also: Ethereum's New Radical: Glen Weyl Isn't Vitalik But He's Its Next Best Hope  Of course, the vTaiwan community today is not the same community at launch in 2014. All of us who were part of the original thing are still around, but the people who are running it are like 10 years younger than us now. And so, to your question, I think it is not just a migration thing. It is also how each generation thinks about experimentation. The original use of vTaiwan’s Polis was considered very cutting edge in 2015 because it was very new. But now, the government regularly uses the Join platform, which has Polis embedded in it, so it’s a sign that Polis is no longer R&D – public servants feel comfortable using it. The state's role is to maintain the mature open source products and make sure it's part of the public civic infrastructure.  Are you familiar with Nathan Schneider?  I read his tweets.  So he recently wrote a book about digital democracy, and has since begun researching what would happen if digital democracy was basically everywhere online. Like, if you had to vote on any number of decisions, wouldn’t that be a nightmare?  You refer to “Governable Spaces?”  Exactly.  We had some conversations, not with Nathan, but with people doing similar research. I think it all depends on how top down it is. For example, the Zero Summit (which is happening today and tomorrow) almost always uses Slido, the very thin way to crowdsource Q&As. But Slido was also acquired by Webex to be just one feature during the video chats. Democratic tech becomes a very thin layer like that.  See also: 'We've Seen Breakdowns of Trust': Nathan Schneider Discusses His New Book 'Governable Spaces'  People being in the same Discord workspace is also this sort of governable space as part of their toolkit; they don't even need to think about it as digital democracy. But it actually increases the throughput of coordination and makes collaboration easier and in that setting. I don't think it's particularly dystopian, because it's literally just increasing the bandwidth and reducing latency of governance. We grow from that, like from four people to 400 people to 40,000 people and so on.  I have a few slightly personal questions, you don't have to answer them. Are you an extropian?  How would you define it? Like someone who wants to live indefinitely?  Yeah, I guess so.  Well, I have a very different relationship with longevity. I was born with a heart condition that for the first 12 years of my life, whenever I went to sleep it was a 50/50 chance that I would survive. I needed to get the surgery for the condition when I was 12. So I'm good now, but it shaped my personality. I always have this compulsion to publish before I perish every night. So I publish everything. So in a sense, I think it's also extropian.  Do you think Taiwan should raise taxes?  I mean, our taxes are so low by OECD standards. But we're doing pretty good with a very low tax rate. Last year, we even gave everyone $100, including young people, because we got more taxes than we anticipated from TSMC and so on.  How long do you intend to stay in government office?  So I'm stepping out on May 20.  What are you doing next?  I'm on a book tour. I'm going to go to Madrid and Paris for VivaTech. And I think to Croatia, for BlockSplit and also to Helsinki, Berlin – I'm missing a few. So many different countries in a span of three to four weeks right after May 20.  Do you hold cryptocurrencies?  I did, back in 2010-11 I consulted for one bitcoin per hour. But when I became a public servant I quite explicitly got out. My consultation rates when I started, bitcoin was something like 100 U.S. dollars and then it grew to $300 or $400 by this time I entered the cabinet in 2016. So it was still not very significant.  Obviously, you are a strong advocate for open source everything. Do you think the same arguments hold true in the world of AI?  Yeah, I mean, my mainframes started as computationally expensive. Open source still managed to thrive. But of course, during those times of the Free Software movement, open source started to thrive when personal computers started to get connected to the internet circa 1997. What I'm trying to get at is that I think the fundamental freedoms, like the freedom to use software for any purpose, is doubly true when it comes to machine learning and machine training models. If a foundation model cannot be governed by the people who use it, then essentially it's the people who train those foundation models, determining its worldview, perspectives and epistemic norms of the people using the model.  So for example, in Taiwan, there is the National Science and Technology Council, which aligns the Lama3 models using local crowdsourced – what we call the alignment assembly, which is when people’s general preferences determine how it should behave – like with regards to the use of imaging celebrities in advertisements. It is a mini public microcosm of our population to determine the guide rails affected by it. The ability to steer AI is very important. And that openness to steering is the key whether you call it open source, or open weights or open access.  Do you think the models will establish AGI?  It only makes sense if you're like placing robots in place of people, because that's that's what AGI is – it can do what people can do. But in the actual way we're using AI nowadays, it’s more like assistive intelligence. The email replying modem doesn't send the email on my behalf, right? It just drafts emails on my behalf, using my style.  All these uses increase our collective intelligence. And if the goal is plurality, then AGI is more like a distraction.  Do you think Taiwan will remain a democracy in the next decade, 50 years or century?  Of course, of course. Depending on the ranking, we're either the most democratic country in all of Asia or the second: sometimes to Japan, sometimes to New Zealand. But we're certainly among the top and in terms of internet freedom. I think it is this combination that is very rare, because many jurisdictions think to allow for this amount of internet freedom, it will surely lead to polarization and decline of democracy. But Taiwan is living proof that you can have maximal internet and also a functional democracy without polarization.  I really liked your phrase “humor over rumor.” When is it appropriate to apply a strategy like that?  I think some sort of humor, at least on a personal level, is always good. When I look at very trollish, toxic text, I automatically focus on the like three words out of 3,000 that can be construed as funny or informative. Through this lens, we can enjoy interacting with the parts that's actually enjoyable.  I often find that just making fun of oneself can be disarming. If you go to my Flickr, there's this whole album of me making memes like this, so whenever there’s some controversy at the ministry I can quickly respond with a mimetic picture as a very funny rebuttal. We call it pre-bunk. That is that you don't need to wait for information manipulation, polarization or conspiracy theories – you can make a funny scoreboard of people's preferences of AstraZeneca versus BNP versus Maderna if there’s controversy over the COVID vaccine.  So you have a knack for a turn of phrase. Is there one expression that you choose to live by?  Oh, yeah, I would like to be a good enough ancestor.  Oh, that's a good one.  I think good enough means that we don't over-design and foreclose the possibility of future generations. They're going to be much more creative, but it is our job to make sure that they have a larger canvas when they are born into the world compared to when I was born into the world.

28287066,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609318,1716411605,Ethereum Bullish Turn: Analyst Highlight Positive Bias In ETH Options Across All Expiries,"Recent developments in the crypto market indicate a strong bullish sentiment among Ethereum traders, particularly in the options market. Amid the growing anticipation for potential approvals of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), there has been a noticeable shift in option pricing, with Ethereum call options becoming more expensive than put options across all expiries. This pricing pattern suggests the market is optimistic about Ethereum’s price prospects. Notably, A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specified price within a specific time frame. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Set For A Major Rally? Options Traders Bet Big On $3,600+ Targets For June This option type is typically purchased by traders who believe the asset’s price will increase. Conversely, a put option provides the holder the right to sell the asset at a predetermined price and is often used as protection against a decline in the asset’s price. Market Indicators Point To A Bullish Ethereum Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit, highlighted this trend in his communication with The Block. He noted that the “put minus call skew is negative across all expiries and increasing further beyond the end-of-June expiry, a quite bullish signal.” Additionally, the basis, or the annualized premium of the futures price over the spot price, has increased to around 14%, further reinforcing the bullish outlook. The analysis reveals that traders prefer to purchase call options at a premium compared to put options, particularly for those set to expire at the end of June and later. This pattern is a sign of a bullish market, indicating that traders are not as interested in securing protection against potential price drops as they are in anticipating that Ethereum’s value will keep climbing. Meanwhile, after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) unexpectedly asked for changes in filings, there has been a resurgence in optimism regarding the possible approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. This optimism has translated into significant market activity, with Deribit experiencing nearly unprecedented trading volumes. Strijers remarked, “We recorded an almost unprecedented trading volume of $12.5 billion notional over the last 24 hours.” This surge in trading volume and market interest reflects how traders and investors position themselves to capitalize on the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. According to data from Deribit, over $480,000 calls will expire by the end of this month, with a notional value of more than $1.7 billion. The data further reveals that the strike price reaches as high as $7,000, with a total intrinsic value of $1.452 billion, indicating that many Ethereum options traders are highly bullish on ETH. ETH Price Performance And Forecast Meanwhile, Ethereum is undergoing slight retracement, down by 2.4% in the past 24 hours, with a trading price of $3,690. Despite this pullback, the asset has maintained a strong uptrend, rising nearly 25% over the past seven days. As the market’s anticipation around spot ETH ETFs grows, a prominent crypto analyst has suggested a potential price movement for Ethereum, indicating a brief pullback at around $4,000 before surging to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Crucial Breakout: Could $4,000 Be The Next Move?

28284787,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609283,1716408047,"Shiba Inu Price Can’t Reach $0.01, Crypto Pundit Reveals Why","Crypto analyst Oscar Ramos has outlined why he doesn’t believe the Shiba Inu price can go above $0.01 this cycle. He made this statement while alluding to the possibility of the meme coin reaching $0.5 at some point in the future. Why Shiba Inu Can’t Go Above $0.01 Ramos mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Shiba Inu can’t go above $0.01 because of its current supply of over 589 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The crypto analyst made this remark while sharing a prediction chart from the price prediction website Telegaon, which showed that Shiba Inu could reach $0.5 in 2040. Related Reading: Why Is The Ethereum Price Up 20% Today? Indeed, Shiba Inu’s circulating supply significantly impacts its price, which is why the Shiba Inu team has made a conscious effort to reduce the amount of SHIB tokens in circulation through regular token burns. Shiba Inu’s burn tracker had previously noted that Shiba Inu’s circulating supply would need to be just over 85 billion for its price to even reach $0.01, as Ramos predicts. That means almost 80% of Shiba Inu’s circulating supply still needs to be burned for the meme coin to attain Ramos’ price target. Crypto YouTuber Jeff had previously suggested that it was almost impossible for Shiba Inu to burn that much of its circulating supply, stating that it would take over 1 million years for Shiba Inu’s circulating supply to reduce to 100 billion tokens. However, there is no doubt that the Shiba Inu team has still made great efforts to reduce the meme coin’s circulating supply. Over 76 billion SHIB tokens were burned in 2023, while 83 billion were burned the previous year. Seeing how Shiba Inu’s price has increased since last year, these efforts are paying off. While burning 80% of Shiba Inu’s circulating supply still seems like a far-fetched goal, SHIB token burns are expected to increase exponentially, especially thanks to innovations like layer-2 network Shibarium, which uses some of the transaction fees earned for SHIB burns. Therefore, the number of token burns carried out will increase as Shibarium enjoys more adoption. SHIB Can At Least Rise To $0.011 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez had previously predicted that Shiba Inu could make a historic run from its current price level and rise to as high as $0.011. Other crypto analysts have also given bullish price predictions for Shiba Inu, although not as bullish as Martinez’s. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Pour $942 Million Into Bitcoin, Will This Trigger A Rally To $80,000? Crypto analyst Armando Pantoja predicted that Shiba Inu could reach $0.001 and even claimed this would happen after the Bitcoin halving. Ramos has also given his bullish prediction for SHIB in this bull run, as he predicts that the meme coin can shed another zero from its current price and rise to $0.0001. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at around $0.00002603, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418100,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcbvR,1716406197,AI-Focused Tokens Edge Higher Ahead of Nvidia Earnings Results,"Artificial intelligence-focused cryptocurrencies climbed Wednesday, defying the muted action of the broader digital asset market ahead of the quarterly earnings report of chip-making heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) due later.  Large-cap AI tokens such as Fetch.ai's FET, Render's RNDR, Bittensor's TAO and SingularityNET's AGIX advanced 4%-5% over the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. Decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePin) AIOZ Network's token (AIOZ) jumped 7% during the day after an announcement that the chip-maker listed the project on the Nvidia Accelerated Applications Catalog where users can search for tools and services built on Nvidia platforms.  The native token of layer-1 (L1) network Near Protocol (NEAR) – which attracted some buzz when its co-founder spoke at an Nvidia conference earlier this year – saw a 2% gain during the same period and was the best performing asset – in the CoinDesk 20, which fell 0.6% alongside modest declines for bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}}.  Today's broad market decline came after the past few days' breakneck rally on several positive regulatory developments in the U.S. and falling bond yields as inflation fears abated.  Nvidia shares were lower by 1.5% just ahead of the close of regular trading Wednesday, with the earnings results due after the bell.Patrick Moorhead, founder and CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance earlier this week that ""the company is going to clearly beat expectations.""

42418112,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcf9h,1716405300,SEC's Gensler Going Rogue in Solo Quest to Stop U.S. Crypto Legislation?,"Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler is holding the line that he doesn't need legislation to police crypto, even as the White House and others say they're ready to hash out regulatory policies.  A presidential policy statement on Wednesday said the White House is eager to establish a ""comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework.""  The White House is ""eager"" to work on a crypto bill. That was the sentiment of its latest statement on Wednesday, putting the administration on-the-record again about wanting new digital assets policies to protect investors.  But U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler – the securities watchdog President Joe Biden hired as a member of his transition team and a key regulator – says don't bother. Gensler's strong view that existing laws give his agency plenty of authority seems to go against other U.S. regulatory agencies, the White House and its Treasury Department.  Gensler, in a statement he issued against the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) on Wednesday – as the bill heads toward a vote that's expected to count a significant number of Democratic supporters – accused crypto firms again of showing ""their unwillingness to comply with applicable laws and regulations for more than a decade, variously arguing that the laws do not apply to them or that a new set of rules should be created and retroactively applied to them to excuse their past conduct.""  ""The crypto industry’s record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies is not because we don't have rules or because the rules are unclear,"" Gensler argued. ""It’s because many players in the crypto industry don’t play by the rules.""  Biden's White House may not like FIT21 either, but a policy statement the same morning said the administration is ""eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities.""  Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) said in a CoinDesk TV interview on Wednesday that many House Democrats ""recognize that the existing Securities and Exchange Commission rules are inadequate."" Hill added that FIT21 is trying to give Gensler's agency a roadmap for handling this sector.  ""I cannot explain why he's taken the position that he had,"" Hill said. ""I think he's isolated from other regulatory leaders.""  The SEC didn't immediately respond to a request Wednesday to comment on whether Gensler sees himself at odds with fellow government officials.  The SEC's sister agency in policing the U.S. markets, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC), has taken a strong pro-legislation position, arguing that existing law leaves a hole in oversight of the crypto spot markets for non-securities, such as bitcoin {{BTC}}. CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam has told lawmakers that ""Congress needs to act"" on crypto legislation, and he's said that if FIT21 passes, his agency can build a regulatory framework within 12 months. A CFTC spokesperson told CoinDesk on Tuesday that the agency would not comment on the bill.  Consumer-protection groups seem to be in Gensler's corner on this, and Mark Hays, a senior policy analyst for Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress, dismissed the apparent contrasts among different corners of the federal government.  ""It reflects slightly different takes on what's important and the 'art' of what's possible in politics,"" he told CoinDesk in an email. The regulators ""all have different tools to address crypto regulation matters. Some of them have exercised that role effectively; others could do more.""  The spot-markets gap could be filled by separate legislation naming the SEC its regulator, said Hays, who argued that in matters of investor protection the SEC's view should get some deference, despite the CFTC ""playing the spoiler."" His groups are among dozens of organizations opposing FIT21 on consumer-protection grounds.  The federal courts – despite Gensler's contention that judges have agreed with his agency ""time and again"" on crypto matters – haven't yet provided consistent answers on whether tokens should be treated as securities, and the final say may still need to come from the U.S. Supreme Court. So, it's a race between Congress and the courts on who will define how tokens such as bitcoin, Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}, tether {{USDT}} and solana {{SOL}} should be handled in the U.S.  Among other government voices clamoring for crypto legislation, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier this year that ""Congress should pass legislation to provide for the regulation of stablecoins and of the spot market for crypto-assets that are not securities."" The Treasury interest in the spot markets and illicit finance doesn't leave a clear picture yet on exactly what the administration's financial arm would be interested in for crypto oversight, though the White House has certainly indicated that FIT21 isn't it.  But whether the government likes it or not, that's the first crypto bill that will receive a vote in one of the chambers of Congress, leaving it as the most prominent piece of digital assets legislation in the conversation.  ""We're disappointed that Chairman Gensler doesn't see that this is better than current law and gives him the tools, ability, and a process that can allow him to be a better regulator and a better supervisor in this space,"" Hill said.

28282383,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609319,1716404417,Built On An $6 Million NFT Scam? AI Company Accused Of Fraud By Internet Investigator,"Youtuber and Internet investigator Coffeezilla has called out Artificial Intelligence (AI) company Rabbit for allegedly being built on a $6 million non-fungible token (NFT) scam. The company is accused of being responsible for the GAMA NFT Project “fraud” as part of a history of lies. Related Reading: Fake NFT Project Hack? CTO Vanishes After Allegedly Stealing 94 SOL Down The NFT Fraud Rabbit Hole Stephen Findeisen, better known as Coffeezilla, published a YouTube video calling out Rabbit Inc. for being built on the remains of an alleged NFT fraud from 2021. The internet investigator revealed that the company is seemingly trying to hide its ties to the GAMA project. Coffeezilla unveiled the depth of the AI company’s rabbit hole by claiming that, despite raising over $30 million in venture capital (VC), Rabbit used to be called Cyber Manufacture Corporation. In 2021, the company raised over $6 million for its “next-generation NFT Project GAMA.” The project was described as a decentralized organization “with the grand goal of sending 10,000 astronauts into space to collect extraterrestrial energy.” At the time, GAMA’s founder Jesse Lyu would make “wild promises,” claiming the NFTs were just the start. According to the YouTube sleuth, Lyu declared they would create “the first-ever carbon-negative cryptocurrency powered by our sun.” The founder promised to build a clean energy grid through NFT sales owned by NFT buyers. The grid’s energy would be used to mine GAMA tokens. However, the tokens were never launched, and the project seemed to be abandoned. Its team replied to Coffeezilla’s request for comment, stating that GAMA was not abandoned but “open-sourced.” Moreover, they claimed a token was never promised, as Lyu said in 2021 that his words were not final. The team added that they live in a country that “values free speech.” Nonetheless, the internet investigator found that the “open-sourced” engine constantly crashed and was non-functional after several tests. He also highlighted that Lyu stated in several discord messages that the project’s cryptocurrency was part of the roadmap. Based on this, Coffeezilla questioned where the $6 million in funding went and whether Lyu’s new project should be trusted. Another Rabbit In The Hat? GAMA’s founder has embarked on a new project unrelated to NFTs. His latest company, Rabbit, focuses on AI technology. The company went viral in early 2024, raising $30 million in VC and selling over $20 million in consumer products. Rabbit launched their AI personal assistance device, Rabbit R1, on easter 2024. However, the project has received a lot of backlash for not living up to the hype and promises. Several tech reviewers concurred that R1 was part of a trend of releasing “unfinished” products. According to YouTuber Marques Brownlee, Rabbit’s product was “barely reviewable” and the pinnacle of “delivering barely finished products to win a race.’” Moreover, founder and CTO of WeGPT, Josh Ollin, called the project a “scam” when R1 was announced. He also pointed out on different occasions that the hype and interactions around the company were “fake impressions” from bots. Ollin called Lyu an “NFT grifter” and stated that his past behavior affected the new project due to the “shady insincere fraudulent business practices on display (fake engagement, fake bot followers, fake tech stack, overpriced vaporware).” Coffeezilla stated a similar sentiment in his video: So many of the promises of Gama didn’t happen. This is relevant to the R1 not just because this project is built on the skeleton of that scam project, it’s also because the R1 is overhyped in a similar way. Related Reading: Altcoins ‘Maniac Phase’ Preparing, Analysts Call For Next Leg Up As noted by the internet sleuth, Lyu has diminished his links to GAMA NFT, calling it a “fun little project” he was “involved with” during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, he considers it important for users to know the company’s “history of abandoning investors like they did with GAMA NFT.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",NEGATIVE,SOL,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | ICO | SOL | SPONSORED,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/built-on-an-6-million-nft-scam-ai-company-accused-of-fraud-by-internet-investigator/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/28282383.jpeg

42418127,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcfM5,1716401968,U.S. House Set to Vote for First Standalone Crypto Market Structure Bill,"The U.S. House of Representatives is poised to vote in favor of a crypto market structure bill for the first time, in a symbolic effort to radically reshape the country's digital asset regulatory landscape.  The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, sponsored by members of the House Financial Services and House Agriculture Committees, will begin seeing votes Wednesday afternoon, where it is expected to pass with a bipartisan majority.  The bill, dubbed FIT21, would grant the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) greater spot-market authority over digital assets deemed to be commodities, while also creating new jurisdictional lines for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Crypto companies and digital asset issuers would have a framework for determining whether and how their assets are securities under the terms defined by the bill, which in turn would let them know who their primary regulator could be.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who chairs the Financial Services Committee, told reporters on Tuesday that he hoped for ""a substantial vote"" in favor of the legislation to demonstrate that there is real momentum for digital asset legislation, a week after the Senate voted in favor of a House resolution that overturned SEC accounting guidance.  The bill is expected to pass, with a handful of Democrats joining a majority of Republicans in voting in favor of the bill. The bill's path through the Senate is less clear, and the White House earlier Wednesday said it opposed the legislation, though President Joe Biden did not threaten a veto.  For and against  The bill has been the subject of a large amount of discussion in recent days.  Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), one of at least nine Democrat lawmakers who said they would support the bill, said he ""look[ed] forward to working with my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee on our continued oversight of this issue.""  ""FIT21 is an important step forward in the regulation of the cryptocurrency industry and a meaningful improvement on the status quo,"" he said in a statement.  Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) announced he would vote in favor of the bill shortly before the vote on Wednesday, saying ""we need blockchain innovation here in America.""  Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) told reporters on Tuesday that the bill creates a ""5-step test on whether something is a decentralized blockchain or not,"" and includes a roadmap for the regulator to utilize.  In comments to the House Rules Committee, he said the lawmakers who developed the bill had engaged with regulators – including the SEC – for more than a year, incorporating their feedback to the legislation.  ""We included provisions to mitigate conflicts of interest. We impose capital and other necessary requirements on intermediaries. And we impose higher standards for custody,"" he said.  There's an interim process as well, where companies need to file a ""notice of intent to register"" with the agencies, he said.  Read more: Democrat House Leadership Says Crypto Bill Vote Won't Be Whipped  Opposition to the bill, however, starts within the House Financial Services Committee itself.  Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the committee, dubbed the bill the ""not fit for purpose act"" and told the House Rules Committee on Tuesday that it ""is perhaps the worst, most harmful deregulatory proposal I have seen in a long time,"" likening it to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. The CFMA, Waters charged, deregulated certain derivatives products which later ""blew up our economy when AIG collapsed.""  FIT21 does not give the CFTC greater authority to target fraud or other crimes, despite directing the agency to oversee digital commodities, she said. The bill also sunsets disclosure requirements after 180 days, meaning the regulator cannot force companies it's supposed to regulate to provide audited financial statements past that deadline.  ""What is even more problematic is the bill’s definition of quote 'investment contract assets,'"" she said. ""Securities that meet this definition would be transferred into a regulatory void, with no primary regulator and virtually no laws and regulations to speak of. Importantly, the definition of investment contract asset is not limited to crypto, and it would be fairly easy for both crypto and traditional securities to be formatted to meet this definition.""  Interest groups weigh in  A group of unions, consumer protection organizations, academics and others sent a public letter to House Speaker Michael Johnson (R-La.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) asking them to vote against the bill and laying out a list of concerns similar to Gensler's.  The letter took aim at the industry more broadly, saying crypto ""still struggles to demonstrate viable use cases outside of speculative investment"" and referencing the various ongoing bankruptcies and civil and criminal litigation.  ""The industry has superficially recovered this year, in part due to controversial approval of spot BTC ETPs by the Securities Exchange Commission,"" the letter said. ""Yet, the scams, hacks, theft, instability, reckless promotional activities, and regulatory evasion that were present during the last crypto bull market remain endemic in the industry today.""  The letter was signed by organizations including the AFL-CIO, Americans for Financial Reform, Revolving Door Project, the National Consumer Law Center and over 30 others as well as 10 individuals.  Echoing Gensler, the groups said they are concerned the bill would weaken existing securities laws to the point where even non-crypto companies could ""evade more rigorous oversight"" by tying themselves to a decentralized network (or at least claiming they were tied to a decentralized network). While the bill gives the CFTC greater authority, the letter said this authority ""is vague,"" to the point it could undermine other agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  ""All told, we believe this bill as written introduces a policy 'cure' that would be far worse than the disease and create significant harm within and far beyond the crypto industry,"" the letter said.  Advocates for the bill argue that legislation is needed to support companies' efforts to ""build a better financial services system and better internet.""  ""Since the inception of the Bitcoin network in 2009, the blockchain and digital asset industry has existed without targeted market regulation,"" a letter filed by the Blockchain Association, a lobby group, said. ""The absence of clear rules leads to confusion in the marketplace for companies – and leaves users and consumers unprotected.""  Read more: Crypto Industry Rallies Behind House Bill as It Heads Toward Final Vote  The letter, signed by groups including stablecoin issuer Circle, Ethereum incubator ConsenSys, venture capital firm Digital Currency Group, exchanges such as Kraken and 50 other companies in the sector, went on to argue that the ""lack of clarity"" risked putting the U.S. behind in ""the global technology race.""  SEC Chair Gary Gensler published a statement on Wednesday opposing the legislation. In it, he raised the specter of crypto's various collapses and frauds, suggesting the bill might allow even traditional pump and dumpers or penny stock pushers to escape oversight by branding themselves as using decentralized networks.  ""We should make the policy choice to protect the investing public over facilitating business models of noncompliant firms,"" he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/22/us-house-set-to-vote-for-first-standalone-crypto-market-structure-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/593aa65fe899374debbd85a5112cb638787b5011-4009x2256.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Even with this cool-off, some analysts are upbeat, predicting the coin will extend gains in future sessions. Bitcoin Finds Strong Support Between $70,180 and $70,600 In a post on X, one analyst believes Bitcoin has strong support at around $70,180 and $70,600. The analyst explained that on-chain data shows that over 450,000 addresses collectively bought over 273,000 BTC at this price range. For this reason, the concentration of BTC holdings in this zone means the coin has strong support. If the level is to be broken, then sellers would need to make an even larger effort to break through this line, with a higher amount of BTC hitting the sell side of the equation. Related Reading: Bollinger Bands Inventor Foresees Bitcoin Pullback: Key Levels To Watch On-chain analytics firm Glassnode notes that the Bitcoin market is cooling after intense selling pressure. After the strong uptick that saw the coin roar to as high as $73,800 in March 2024, prices plunged to as low as $56,500 this month. Prices have since recovered, but bulls have yet to break above all-time highs. While capital inflows remain moderate, Glassnode adds, volatility has decreased noticeably. Still, whether this volatility will shoot higher once $72,000 is broken remains to be seen. BTC Retraces: Will Bulls Break $72,000? All eyes are on whether BTC bulls will shake off the current correction. In a post on X, another analyst said holders shouldn’t be worried because of this pullback and the failure of bulls to confirm the May 20 leg up. Instead, the analyst is confident, saying pullbacks are a natural part of any bull market. The recent 23% correction, the analyst added, is an example. What’s important is that every retracement has been from a higher position. Therefore, the next local bottom will likely be higher than the previous one, potentially reaching around $80,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Seen Breaching $73,000 As ‘Bull Run’ Looms, Analyst Says Thus far, BTC has a strong resistance of $72,000. The bulls didn’t push through this line, even with more serious attempts in early April. As a result, this reaction level remains important from a technical perspective. Any breakout for now would increase the probability of BTC prices floating to retest $73,800 or break higher. In the days ahead, inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) coupled with improving sentiment might spark more demand. In that likelihood, BTC bulls will find the momentum to confirm the May 20 bar and break above the local resistance.

42418130,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcfN7,1716398048,Expanding Horizons: Looking Beyond Bitcoin,"Jason Leibowitz, Head of Private Wealth at Hashnote, discusses the evolution of the crypto market and the forward-looking strategies implemented by Hashnote to navigate this dynamic landscape.  The interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial. The views and opinions expressed are those of the author and not associated with CoinDesk. This is not financial advice.  How has Bitcoin’s recent halving impacted the crypto asset class, and what opportunities does it present for investors?  The Bitcoin halving decreases the supply of new Bitcoin into circulation by reducing mining rewards, thus curbing selling pressure from miners. Historically, these events have precipitated significant price appreciation in the following 12 to 18 months. While future outcomes are uncertain, optimism remains high for potential new all-time highs in the coming year.  How should investors be thinking about their portfolios in response to the implications of the Bitcoin halving and the evolving dynamics of the crypto market cycle?  Given the Bitcoin halving's impact and evolving market dynamics, portfolio realignment may be prudent. While Bitcoin's performance often sets the tone for market sentiment, diversifying across major cryptocurrencies could mitigate risks associated with single-asset exposure. Exploring indexes like the CoinDesk 20 Index offers broader market exposure beyond Bitcoin. Investors may find that such indexes help give an understanding of broader market dynamics and can be an asset to their toolkit.  How do asset managers like Hashnote aim to give investors exposure to the CoinDesk 20 Index?  Hashnote facilitates access to the CoinDesk 20 via its CoinDesk 20 Index Fund Series, streamlining portfolio diversification. This offering, part of Hashnote’s new Long Token Fund, simplifies the management of multiple cryptocurrencies by offering exposure to a market cap-weighted basket of the top 20 coins that make up the CoinDesk 20. The Hashnote CoinDesk 20 Index Fund Series offers an efficient and convenient means for investors to access diversified exposure to the crypto market.  The CoinDesk 20 just went through a reconstitution, per the public methodology, and added the NEAR Protocol. Would you like to comment on the reconstitution?  A notable addition to the CoinDesk 20 during the second quarter's rebalancing is NEAR Protocol, a layer-one blockchain renowned as a community-run cloud computing platform. NEAR Protocol stands out for its innovative solutions to common blockchain challenges, such as low transaction speeds and poor interoperability. What sets NEAR apart is its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the protocol. NEAR aims to democratize AI by making it open source, leveraging its not-for-profit and decentralized nature. This integration of AI is expected to accelerate development speed and improve user experience, in line with NEAR's vision of fostering an open, permissionless ecosystem. This exemplifies the CoinDesk 20’s forward-thinking methodology that now includes successful projects like NEAR that drive innovation in the crypto sphere, helping enable investor access to emerging technologies poised for significant growth.  What feedback have you received from clients and industry participants regarding the CoinDesk 20 Index?  Feedback on the CoinDesk 20 has been overwhelmingly positive, reflecting several key advantages appreciated by both clients and industry participants. Many clients have expressed the need for a reliable benchmark to compare their crypto investments against, and the CoinDesk 20 serves this purpose effectively. Additionally, clients are relieved that they no longer have to manage multiple wallets and private keys across various cryptocurrencies, thanks to the Hashnote CoinDesk 20 Index Fund Series’ one-touch, diversified access.  Industry participants have also noted the CoinDesk 20's alignment with the Markowitz Model of Portfolio Theory, which suggests that risks can be minimized through diversification. The CoinDesk 20’s market cap-weighted index provides efficient exposure to a broad range of digital assets, embodying this principle. Furthermore, the CoinDesk 20 addresses the difficulty clients faced in sourcing liquidity for smaller tokens and deciding which non-core tokens (beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum) to allocate to. Overall, the CoinDesk 20 has become a valuable tool for investors seeking comprehensive and efficient market exposure, facilitating broader adoption of cryptocurrencies within traditional investment portfolios.

This projection, slightly higher than the cryptocurrency’s previous peak, comes with an unexpected and wholly ambitious timeline. Bitcoin Poised To Reach New All-Time Highs Geoff Kendrick, Head of EM FX Research, West and Crypto Research, Standard Chartered, has made a bullish prediction for Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. In an email to TheBlock, Kendrick stated that Bitcoin is poised to break out of its previous all-time high on March 14, 2024, to witness a massive surge to approximately $73,798. Related Reading: Crypto Market Liquidations Top $330 Million In 24 Hours With Ethereum In The Lead The analyst has projected a rather grandiose timeline for this bullish rally, expecting Bitcoin to hit the forecasted price target by the weekend. Kendrick attributed this potential price increase to the recent inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Earlier on May 21, data from Farside investors indicated that Spot Bitcoin ETFs had recorded their best inflow week in the last two months. The digital asset saw over $305.7 million in inflows, with BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), amassing the largest inflows of $290 million. Cumulatively, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded inflows of more than $13 billion from its launch on January 11 to the present. This increased demand and influx of capital which had been a major contributor to Bitcoin’s previous rise to a new all-time high in March, could propel fresh surges for the cryptocurrency. Kendrick has also disclosed that the possible approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could have a significant impact on Bitcoin’s price dynamics. The analyst has doubled down on his previous price prediction which anticipates Bitcoin’s rise to $150,000 by the end of 2024 and a whopping $200,000 increase in 2025. BTC Price Analysis As of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $70,013, reflecting a slight decline of 1.39% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady bullish momentum over the past week, experiencing consistent price surges, which have led to a sharp increase of 12.86%. Related Reading: Solana Cup And Handle Pattern Means An At Least 90% Move Against Ethereum, Analyst Says Popular crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe has reported that Bitcoin is up more than 20% since its previous lows of $56,000 earlier this year. The approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF could see the cryptocurrency’s price potentially rising more, following previous patterns when the SEC’s approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs triggered a major price spike for the pioneer cryptocurrency. This sentiment for a bullish breakout is shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who has asserted that Bitcoin is currently showing a strong potential for further gains, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s robust price potential and strong fundamentals.

But beneath the surface, there's been tension in the Ethereum developer community over the largest smart-contracts blockchain's future and progress toward decentralization. The sniping became especially acute with the revelations this week that two of the Ethereum Foundation's biggest stars have accepted multimillion-dollar token incentive packages from EigenLayer, the pioneering restaking protocol that has been flagged as possibly posing a systemic risk to Ethereum. Read on.  ALSO:  After top Ethereum devs exchange words, co-founder Vitalik Buterin praises the blockchain's culture of freedom to express ""negative feelings,"" then bangs out 3,000-plus word post from a location in Kenya.

We took a spin through all the planned panel discussions, Protocol Village Stage programming and side events (yay!) related to blockchain tech and, well, let's just say… there is a lot.

Network news  Ethereum Foundation's Dankrad Feist, the namesake of ""danksharding"" and a central figure in this week's drama in the Ethereum community (Bradley Keoun)  MEV SNIPING! It's not clear exactly what started it all, but top Ethereum developers locked horns on the social-media platform X, in an intense and almost uncomfortable-to-observe debate touching on the practice of maximal extractable value, or MEV – essentially, the use of sophisticated trading bots to frontrun user transactions at the point of execution. On May 16, Ethereum core developer Péter Szilágyi tweeted about his despair over the lack of progress in pushing to solve some of the blockchain's most vexing issues. ""Voila, the banking system recreated,"" he wrote. One of his points was that Ethereum had ""glorified"" MEV, remarking, ostensibly in sarcasm, that it was ""futile to fight against MEV, so might as well lean hard on it, right?"" (As chronicled in last week's issue of The Protocol, even U.S. government officials now appear to characterize MEV as standard operating procedure on the blockchain.) Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist retweeted Szilágyi's post with the comment, ""This is such a lazy take if you can't also tell me what your supposed solutions are that let local block producers extract MEV."" A back-and-forth ensued, and then Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin chimed in, tweeting that ""I'm really proud that Ethereum does not have any culture of trying to prevent people from speaking their minds, even when they have very negative feelings toward major things in the protocol or ecosystem."" Buterin, who is known to write long, interrupted his work on a project in Kenya to bang out a 3,000-word-plus essay breaking down the issues, concluding: ""I also do not think that the situation is anywhere near as hopeless as Peter's tweets imply.""  ET TU, DANKRAD? The Buterin tweet referenced in that ^^^ episode touched off an entirely separate donnybrook. The pseudonymous crypto influencer Cobie responded to Buterin's tweet, asking the very pointed question of how he felt about ""core developers or researchers taking life–changing $ packages from projects built on Ethereum to become 'advisors,' when those projects may have conflicted incentives with Ethereum, either now or in the future."" At first it wasn't quite clear what the comment referred to. But then, as reported by CoinDesk's Margaux Nijkerk, a top Ethereum Foundation developer, Justin Drake, disclosed that he had taken on a role advising EigenFoundation, with ""a significant token incentive which could easily be worth more than the combined value of all my other assets (mostly ETH),"" and a value of ""millions of dollars of tokens vesting over 3 years."" EigenFoundation supports the restaking protocol EigenLayer, a controversial project partly because experts have warned of its potential systemic risks to the Ethereum blockchain. Shortly after that, Feist (also mentioned ^^^) confessed that he, too, had accepted a paid role at EigenFoundation. The news set off a debate on crypto twitter about whether advising the EigenFoundation would constitute a conflict of interest. ""Even if you pinky promise to not let this cloud your judgment, and do it on a personal capacity, that's impossible,"" wrote Lefteris Karapetsas. One clever jokester deadpanned that the Ethererum researchers were ""restaking themselves now.""  ALSO:  JUST IN: Bitcoin Is Coming to Ethereum Stalwart MetaMask: Sources  Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who has claimed repeatedly to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, lied ""extensively and repeatedly"" in both his written and oral evidence in a major court case in the U.K., according to a scathing judgment in the case.  Eclipse Labs, the primary developer behind the modular Ethereum layer-2 network Eclipse, which is powered by Solana Virtual Machine and Celestia data availability and claims to be ultrafast, appointed Vijay Chetty as its new CEO. His predecessor, Neel Somani, stepped down last week amid sexual assault allegations, though he described them as false.  Alexey Pertsev, developer of the coin mixer Tornado Cash, filed an appeal with the s-Hertogenbosch court of appeal after being found guilty of money laundering on Tuesday , a spokesperson for the court said.  Cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Kraken and other crypto firms have joined an alliance aimed at responding to and preventing online fraud and scams, including so-called pig butchering schemes.

Conservative policy was to promote the U.K. as a hub for the crypto industry, while the Labour Party has not made its stance to the industry clear.  A U.K. general election, which could see the crypto-friendly Conservative Party lose its governing mandate, will take place on July 4, earlier than expected.  ""Earlier today I spoke with His Majesty the King to request the dissolution of Parliament, the King has granted this request and we will have the general election on the fourth of July,"" U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in his statement on Wednesday.  The Conservative Party has said it wants the U.K. to be a crypto hub and has been instrumental in passing legislation recognizing digital assets as regulated financial services in the country. In March, the government hosted members of the crypto community at the prime minister’s official residence at No.10, Downing Street to restate its plan to build legislation for the sector. Stablecoin and staking legislation was expected to come out in the coming weeks, though so far none has been proposed.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who was among the first Conservative Party politicians to set U.K. crypto hub plans in motion, set the date for the election, which could see his party fall after a turbulent 14 years of rule that included the 2020 exit from the European Union and the Covid pandemic.  The last general election, held in December 2019, handed the Conservatives – also known as the Tories – 365 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons. Second-placed Labour won 202. What followed was a period that saw four prime ministers pass through the doors of No. 10, including Liz Truss, who served just 50 days, the shortest term in U.K. history. Her predecessor, Boris Johnson, was forced to resign after breaking Covid lockdown rules and a scandal relating to the appointment of a deputy chief whip.  The opposition Labour Party is the favorite to win the election, according to polls of voting intentions. Labour has not made any statement about crypto legislation. However, the party has said it wants the U.K. to be a tokenization hub and will support the Bank of England's digital pound plans. Tokenization is the creation of a blockchain-based object that represents a real-world asset such as a work of art or a bar of gold.

28275510,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609256,1716393618,Crypto Analyst Reveals Trigger For 17% Polygon (MATIC) Rally,"An analyst has explained how Polygon could see a rally of around 17% if the cryptocurrency’s price breaks above this level. Parallel Channel May Reveal What Could Be Next For Polygon In a post on X, analyst Ali has discussed about a parallel channel that Polygon has been consolidating inside during the last few weeks. The “parallel channel” here refers to a technical analysis (TA) pattern that’s drawn using two parallel trendlines. This pattern’s upper line joins successive tops in the asset while the lower one connects bottoms. While the price is inside the region bounded by these two lines (the “channel”), it’s probable to stay trapped in it, only consolidating sideways. Related Reading: Analyst Says $71,000 Bitcoin Move Is Only Halfway Through, Here’s Why Naturally, retests of the upper line can likely result in reversals back to the downside, while the lower one may act as a source of support, helping the coin bottom out and regain an uptrend. There are different types of parallel channels in TA, like the ascending and descending ones, where the channel is slopped upwards or downwards. In the context of the current topic, though, a parallel channel parallel to the time axis is of interest. This means consolidation inside this channel occurs between the same top and bottom levels. Like with other consolidation patterns in TA, a break out of the trendlines of the parallel channel can also suggest a continuation of the trend in that direction. More specifically, a surge above the pattern can suggest bullish momentum for the asset, while a drop under the channel may spell a bearish outcome instead. Now, here is a chart that shows how the parallel channel that Polygon has been consolidating inside has looked like over the past month: From the above graph, it’s visible that Polygon has been stuck in consolidation inside this parallel channel since the cryptocurrency crash last month. The asset has made some attempts at the upper level, but so far, all of them have failed, with the coin unable to find any break. MATIC is currently floating near the level, so another retest may be coming up soon. Related Reading: Bulls In Control: Ethereum Longs See Biggest Candle Ever After ETF News If the Polygon price surges above the channel this time, it may enjoy some sustained bullish momentum. “A breakout above $0.76 could trigger a 17% surge, pushing $MATIC to $0.88!” notes Ali. This price target is based on the fact that the crash last month, which threw the asset into this consolidation, occurred starting from around that level. Given this potential retest of the upper line of the channel, it now remains to be seen how the cryptocurrency performs in the coming days. MATIC Price Polygon almost touched the $0.76 upper level of the channel yesterday, but the coin has since observed a pullback, and it’s now back down to $0.72.

42418120,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcfEr,1716393600,How Blockchains Can Help Solve AI’s Deepfake Problem,"As AI continues to work itself into our daily lives, it's hard not to see the impact it's already having on nearly every sector. Within the finance industry, for example, AI is facilitating smarter investments, analyzing market trends and predicting stock performance, ultimately helping individuals and institutions make more informed business decisions.  While most of the advancements with AI are exciting and continue to push different industries forward, there are those abusing the technology for more nefarious purposes. With generative AI, one of the biggest risks that individuals and organizations need to be aware of are called “deepfakes.”  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Deepfakes are highly realistic digital forgeries produced with AI to manipulate or generate visual and/or audio content. For example, a deepfake might involve an AI-generated video showing a celebrity engaging in actions or making statements that never actually occurred, such as when comedian Jordan Peele created a deepfake of Barack Obama to showcase the threat AI-generated technology could present.  While we may default to believing what we see, this type of forged or deceptive AI-generated content is becoming increasingly more common. Between 2022 and the first half of 2023, deepfakes as a proportion of content in the U.S.increased almost 13 times from 0.2% to 2.6%, according to a recent report from Sumsub Research.  Experts are already concerned deepfakes could be used to try to sway public opinion or influence important events like elections, with bad actors trying to use AI to impersonate elected officials. They are “completely terrified” that the upcoming Presidential race will involve a “tsunami of misinformation,” driven heavily by deepfake and misleading AI-generated content, another recent report noted. Many view deepfakes’ ability to blur the lines between truth and fiction as a fundamental threat to democracies and fair elections around the globe.  So how do we – as a society – mitigate the prevalence and risks of deepfakes, as well as similar risks that may emerge as generative AI only continues to get more sophisticated?  Blockchains could be the crucial technology we need to help tackle this issue. At their core, public blockchains, such as Ethereum, have several key features that make them uniquely positioned to establish authenticity for content and information. This includes blockchain’s inherent transparency, decentralized nature and focus on network security and immutability.  For those unfamiliar, a public blockchain transparently records information in a time-bound manner, accessible to all, globally, and without gatekeeping. This allows anyone to verify the validity of information, such as its creator or a timestamp, making it a source of truth. Public blockchains are also decentralized, eliminating the need for a central decision-maker, and reducing the risk of manipulation. This decentralized structure also offers high network security by eliminating single points of failure, and ensuring an immutable and tamper-resistant record.  Furthermore, blockchains have already demonstrated their ability to authenticate content. For instance, with digital art as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain tech allows anyone to verify the creator and owner of a piece of art, enabling our ability to distinguish between the original and its potential replicas. This transparency and authentication potential extends to videos, images, and text, providing important foundations for developers to create solutions and tools geared at combating deepfakes, such as OpenAI’s Worldcoin, Irys and Numbers Protocol.  As AI's impact on society grows, AI-generated content and deepfakes will only become more prominent. Harvard experts already predict thatmore than 90% of content online will be AI-generated in the future. To protect against threats such as deepfakes, it's crucial we get ahead of the issue and implement innovative solutions. Public blockchains, collectively owned and operated by users, offer promising features like network security, transparency, and decentralization which can help against the issues deepfakes present.  However, much of the work underway remains in its early stages, and challenges remain with the technical development and widespread adoption of blockchain-related protocols. While there is no quick fix, we must remain committed to shaping a future that upholds truth, integrity, and transparency, as our society navigates these emerging technologies (and the risks they present) together.

42418129,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcfO9,1716393600,How Blockchain is Reshaping Supply Chains Beyond Finance,"Have you ever wondered about the true potential of blockchain technology beyond its association with ﬁnance? Blockchain offers transparency, security, and eﬃciency, revolutionizing processes and unlocking new opportunities for businesses worldwide. Hence, the expected growth trajectories in the coming years.  Below we look at how these benefits can provide advantages to companies adopting blockchain tech beyond pure financial applications.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Transparency: There’s a common misconception that blockchain technology lacks transparency. In reality, it is inherently transparent, thanks to a decentralized ledger system. Each transaction is recorded on a public ledger, enabling quick and easy identiﬁcation of affected products. This transparency enhances accountability and trust in supply chains, ensuring consumer safety and product integrity.  Simplicity: While blockchain technology may seem complex at ﬁrst glance, businesses can beneﬁt from simpliﬁed explanations and practical applications. By focusing on real-world case studies and actionable insights, organizations that are using data science like GE, IBM, PayPal, AWS, Uber, John Deere, NASA and others have grasped data-driven insights across various sectors and its potential to streamline operations, enhance security, and drive innovation.  Global Adoption: Blockchain is revolutionizing industry applications ranging from supply chain management and healthcare to voting systems and digital identity veriﬁcation. For example, AWS introduced Track and Trace with Amazon Managed Blockchain, a fully-managed service that automatically scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications running millions of transactions. Added benefits to leveraging supply chains with blockchain include scalability, cost reduction, transparency and ease of process automation.  Sustainability: Some major companies are leveraging blockchains for sustainability and fair treatment of workers purposes. In recent news, Mondelēz International, the parent to brands like Oreo, Ritz, Clif Bar, Cadbury, and Toblerone, announced that it’s joining the Hedera Council, the entity that governs the Hedera Network, “a sustainable public ledger for the decentralized economy.” By tapping Web3 tech, the Council expects Mondelēz to increase business efficiency and sustainability and innovate across customer engagement.  Conclusion: It's not too late to explore the vast opportunities in the blockchain space. As the industry continues to evolve and mature, early adopters stand to beneﬁt from investment opportunities, technological advancements, and market growth. Blockchain tech holds immense potential beyond ﬁnance, offering transparency, security, and eﬃciency across various industries. By dispelling myths, embracing opportunities, and staying informed, businesses can harness the power of blockchain to drive innovation, foster trust, and achieve sustainable growth.

Daily spot buying from ETH permanent holders hit its highest level in 2024 this week.  A significant price correction is expected if a spot ether ETF is delayed or denied due to high levels of open interest.  Ether {{ETH}} is expected to experience a period of volatility this week due to exchange inflows spiking to the highest level since March, according to a report by data provider CryptoQuant.  The daily net flow of ETH, which tracks inflows and outflows to exchanges, hit 62,000 ether ($231 million) this week. High exchange flows are typically associated with volatility, the report said.  The surge in deposits comes on the back of a significant rally in ether, with prices rising by 22% in two days after Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said that the odds of spot ether exchange traded-fund (ETF) approval have increased to 75% and multiple reports that filing process with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for the ETFs, are suddenly seeing progress.  Traders responded by aggressively opening ETH long positions on perpetual exchanges and buying spot, resulting in the largest daily spot buying from ETH permanent holders so far in 2024. These trades were placed in the hopes that ETH price will see a similar uptick that bitcoin {{BTC}} has seen since the news of the approval of U.S. spot ETFs started to make the rounds last year.  The increase in demand for ETH led to a short squeeze, with 9,300 ETH being liquidated on the short side over a 48-hour period.  CryptoQuant warns that if an ether ETF application is delayed or denied, a significant price reaction could occur due to high open interest, which currently stands at a record high of $11.7 billion.

42418125,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcfL3,1716391810,Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day,"On May 22, 2010, Florida-resident Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 bitcoin {{BTC}} for two Papa Johns pizzas in what is largely considered to be the first purchase ever made with the then experiential digital currency. The value of those coins would be worth just under $700 million today.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The story is well known, a part of “Bitcoin history” and celebrated across the world every year. What is less known is Hanyecz’s other contributions to Bitcoin. According to Bitcoin historian (and former CoinDesk editor) Pete Rizzo, who published a detailed thread about Hanyecz on Wednesday, the first man to ever spend bitcoins in a commercial transaction was also something of a confidant to Satoshi Nakamoto.  See also: Bitcoin Pizza Day: Celebrating the Pizzas Bought for 10000 BTC  This year’s Pizza Day might also be viewed in a new context following the release of 120 pages worth of Satoshi’s emailed correspondence with early Bitcoin developer Martti Malmi (a.k.a. “Sirius”), which raises the question of how much of a coincidence it was that the first purchase using bitcoin was for pizza. Malmi wrote the first FAQ for the Bitcoin.com website, apparently quoting Satoshi’s responses to earlier inquiries. He wrote:  “Bitcoin is valued for the things it can be exchanged to, just like all the traditional paper currencies are.  “When the first user publicly announces that he will make a pizza for anyone who gives him a hundred bitcoins, then he can use bitcoins as payment to some extent – as much as people want pizza and trust his announcement. A pizza-eating hairdresser who trusts him as a friend might then announce that she starts accepting bitcoins as payment for fancy haircuts, and the value of the bitcoin would be higher – now you could buy pizzas and haircuts with them. When bitcoins have become accepted widely enough, he could retire from his pizza business and still be able to use his bitcoin-savings.”  Without reading too much into it, it is interesting that the first bitcoin transaction for a real world object (rather than peer-to-peer exchanges for fiat) was pizza, given Satoshi’s analogy.  But, as Rizzo notes, Hanyecz has contributed far more to Bitcoin than simply proving it could be used in actual purchases. He also was the first to translate Satoshi’s code for Apple’s operating system, allowing a greater number of people to run the actual Bitcoin software. And he was a frequent commentator on the BitcoinTalk forum, where he’d answer questions about the software and how it was designed.  However, Hanyecz and Satoshi didn’t agree on everything. Hanyecz is also thought to be the first person to start mining bitcoin using chips specially designed to run complex computer programs called graphics processing units (GPUs), giving him a leg up against others who were running the Bitcoin source code on everyday computers.  This kicked off what Satoshi called a mining “arms race” that is ongoing today (nowadays, bitcoin miners rely on factories full of application-specific integrated circuits designed specifically for proof-of-work mining). Satoshi was concerned that, because the user base was so low at the time, people would be disincentivized from joining the distributed network if they had to put up cold hard cash to buy specialized equipment.  See also: What Is Bitcoin Pizza Day?  “GPUs would prematurely limit the incentive to only those with high end GPU hardware,” Satoshi wrote. “I don’t mean to sound like a socialist, I don’t care if wealth is concentrated, but for now, we get more growth by giving that money to 100% of the people than giving it to 20%.”  It’s possible that Hanyecz’s post asking for someone to buy his family dinner was in response to this conversation with Satoshi, and a way for Hanyecz to redistribute his accumulated stash of bitcoins via the free market. In his initial ask on May 18, 2010, which went unanswered for three days, Hanyecz offered 10,000 BTC for two pizzas (no anchovies!).  A few days later, on May 21, Hanyecz revisited the post to ask about potentially raising the price. Eventually, 19-year-old Jeremy ""Jercos"" Sturdivant responded and offered to be on the other end of the trade. “I just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza,” Hanyecz said at the time.  According to Rizzo, Hanyecz, who is still active in Bitcoin circles, made the pizza swap an open offer, and may have ultimately spent bitcoins worth around $3 billion worth at today’s prices on Papa Johns pies. There is also apparently a commemorative plaque at the Jacksonville, Florida, location memorializing the purchase.  While other people may rue the day they had spent hundreds of millions of dollars for something so quotidian, Hanyecz apparently has no regrets. “Someone had to start it,” he said in an interview with CNN.  But, whatever way you slice it, with bitcoin again retracing all-time highs, the first bitcoin purchase was also the most expensive pizza ever sold.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/22/happy-bitcoin-pizza-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df71e4755885cc324a491ae835de68b6eb02f602-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418111,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcf8f,1716391090,How to Produce Your Own On-Chain Game Show,"For a few days each year, we all get excited about crypto consumer for one reason:  Game shows.  ""Mad Realities."" ""Love on Leverage."" ""Crypto the Game.""  The challenge has been letting anyone make these sustainably.  Until now.  Imagine this. It’s a few years from now, and a protocol wants to run its own version of ""Shark Tank"" as a new kind of hackathon: one where its community tunes in to vote on their favorite projects.  This feature is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week. David Phelps is the cofounder of JokeRace, which lets anyone deploy contests on 90+ chains to run, grow, and monetize communities  The winning projects get huge rewards, the losing projects get recognition and on-chain credentials for making it so far, and the audience at home gets points from both the chain and from every project they vote for.  Both contestants and voters pay in – because it’s worth it to them for the money, status, opportunities, social connections and potential airdrops they all earn. And that lets game show creators earn big in a way they never could before.  Now imagine bigger. ""Survivor."" ""The Voice."" ""American Idol."" ""The Bachelor."" ""Love Island."" All giving contestants and new ways to earn reputation, to earn rewards and to collaborate socially.  Or think even bigger than that. A monetizable ""Product Hunt."" Presidential debates with an audience live-voting on responses. The Grammies and Oscars with audiences picking who wins.  Any creator could have game shows for their fans to decide who they partner with. What track they release. What’s the most persuasive case they can make for future trends.  And all of this would be built on financial and reputational rails for everyone to earn.  Which is to say:  All of this can only be done on-chain, particularly through us at JokeRace. By anyone. Without needing to worry about a single line of code.  There’s a lot of reasons this wasn’t possible before now – high gas fees, high overhead for managing the tech and challenges letting anyone pay in to vote – but the main one is that it’s been hard to offer meaningful rewards for everyone involved in a game show.  In game shows, there’s literally some reward that’s at stake. That reward is usually financial: you get prize money. Sometimes, it’s reputational: you want the status of winning or backing a winner. And on rare occasions, it’s social; you form a community with others to back a favorite candidate. The best game shows will often integrate elements of financial, reputation and social rewards all at once.  A game show without any rewards at all is a fairly doomed category, and we have a name for this cursed vertical in crypto: governance. In a sense, governance is just a game show without incentives or rewards, and yet in an industry *built on* incentives and rewards, we’ve insisted that the only types of decisions that anyone can make on-chain are rewardless governance.  Why? You might argue that rewards corrupt the integrity of the decision (maybe), but the real answer is because we haven’t wanted to do anything on-chain that would enable these rewards in the first place.  It wasn’t until the launch of EIP-4844 in March, which lowered fees on layer 2s by over 100x, that it started to become sustainable to run social processes on-chain in the land of Ethereum. And it wasn’t until our introduction of ""anyone-can-vote"" that there was a way for anyone to participate in voting on-chain.  This is the first time it’s been feasible to build game shows like the ones above. And now that it’s cheap and fast to operate on-chain, we can see the rewards for running on-chain game shows could be huge.  Let me break that down a bit deeper to show how wild this opportunity is for all parties: the contestants, the viewers and the game show creator.  First, and most obviously, contestants can earn from winning. A recurring show might give rewards to all players and teams on a given night, including the lowest-ranking ones that get eliminated.  That seems clear enough, but let me emphasize: contestants can also earn from losing. Even if the losers earn nothing, they still earn on-chain reputation.  Every single person who votes for a contestant is attesting that they liked them. That’s a powerful social graph of permissionless data that the contestants can leverage for future communities, job opportunities, status, social connections and, yes, airdrops. (For instance, if you won on karaoke night, a music project could do worse than to airdrop you its token.)  Imagine running all tiers of a game shows – votes to decide the contestants, votes to decide the finalists, votes to decide the winners. The reputation that everyone earns will create powerful graphs of proof-of-value, a far more meaningful metric than proof-of-humanity to help individuals find the ecosystems where we’re most valued.  Second, audience members can also earn. American gambling rules restrict payouts to voters of winning contestants, but it’s possible to imagine betting opportunities, bribes and rewards overseas.  And what about in America? Voters might still earn other way. For example, they could earn NFTs, tokens or points every time they vote. The fees they pay to vote could be used to buy up a token. They might even be able to swap or sell their voting rights (not financial advice).  See also: Why Crypto Investors Should Care About Tokenomics  But again, they’d build a reputation no matter what. Imagine voting for a no-name contestant who later became a celebrity and being able to prove you not only helped discover them but propel them to glory.  Imagine you were able to develop friends around this contestant who you could reach around the world. And imagine all of this entitled you, once again, to future communities, status, social connections and airdrops. The social graph alone for measuring shared tastes among users could become the most valuable protocol for building a friendship or dating app in existence.  And then, most importantly, the contest creators earn. And they can earn three ways:  1. Data  By operating on-chain, creators will be able to access on-chain information about their participants – what DeFi protocols they use, what NFTs they buy, what communities they’ve joined.  The simplest way to leverage this data is for sponsorships. For example, Rehash, which runs a regular mini-game show on-chain on JokeRace to decide who will appear on its podcast, recently worked with wallet data provider Bello to determine that 20% of their users were Zerion users. That insight was enough to get Zerion to sponsor their whole season.  But this data can be massively useful in other ways. It can let creators understand their community’s values. It can give them leverage to draw other players and judges to the show who are provably popular in their community. And it can incentivize other game shows, products and protocols to want to reward anyone who participated as well.  All of this represents a huge unlock for the show’s growth.  2. Tokenization  Perhaps you need the token to vote. Perhaps voting entitles you to buy the token. Perhaps voting entitles you to get an airdrop for the token. Perhaps paying to vote serves to purchase you the token. Perhaps the token is just used to select the contestants who will appear on the show. Or perhaps the token is just used for the final round.  Endless gamification is possible to support a token for the project.  3. Directly from show itself  Most importantly, contest creators can monetize directly from the show they run. In a game show with 1,000 contestants and thousands of dollars in prizes, they might conceivably charge $10-$20 per entry and make a few thousand dollars.  But in a game show with eight contestants and tens of thousands of voters, they could let anyone pay per vote – say, $1 per vote – and potentially make far more. And that’s for a single episode with a relatively small viewership.  Now imagine how this can scale over time. As the contest creator raises the prices to play, they can use this money to offer bigger rewards. Bigger rewards can then justify higher prices to pay, and so on. Over the course of a few years, they can scale up the financial incentives exponentially—and sustainable.  Imagine this at scale, and creators are making millions.  Game shows are just one use case, but they’re a major one: whenEigenLayer featured eight contestants to pick as their next supported liquid staking token, they got tens of thousands of voters paying in to participate.  See also: 'It's Modding, But on Steroids': Mark Long on the Future of Gaming  You can imagine what this would look like at scale for something like, say, Miss Bumbum: the Brazilian beauty pageant for “best buttocks” that’s gotten more than two million voters for a given contest.  What would (may God forgive me) Miss Bumbum look like on-chain? Well, the incredible thing is that this wasn’t even possible until this week – not only because of low gas fees, but because we’re the first contest tool that has ever let anyone vote. Until now, letting anyone vote would have been a recipe for random bots to give random number of votes.  But when you build on monetary rails that let you charge per vote, you can open up contests to anyone, proportionate to how they pay. And given the potential rewards, as well as the fun of playing, people stand to pay in substantially – if you design your mechanics well.  Of course, part of the mechanics means building a strong social brand, live-streaming with platforms like Unlonely, and taking time to align incentives for everyone involved. Creating a good game show is not easy.  But this week, it at least became easier. Because if you make one – and really, anyone can make one today – you can build a whole business of your own in consumer social on blockchains without writing a single line of code.

The exact timeline is unclear, but one person said access could arrive in MetaMask within the next month. Another person said the exact Bitcoin functionality is not yet set in stone, but features could initially be limited and expanded over time.  MetaMask's Ethereum wallet is the gateway for more than 30 million monthly active users into the Web3 world of decentralized applications and non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. When Ethereum debuted almost a decade ago, it expanded the capabilities of what a blockchain could do beyond what Bitcoin pioneered, adding support for smart contracts – essentially software built atop that blockchain.  MetaMask helps users navigate such a smart contract-based environment. Since early last year, similar functionality has been added to Bitcoin, including NFT-like Ordinals and Runes, which enabled the creation of meme coins on Bitcoin. Whether MetaMask support will help users traverse these Bitcoin enhancements is unclear.

28273293,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609287,1716390049,"Ethereum Rally Looms: Analyst Predicts ETH’s Next Stop Is $5,300","Titan of Crypto, a well-known cryptocurrency trader and expert, in a daring prediction that has drawn the attention of the crypto community, forecasting an impending significant rally for Ethereum (ETH) to unprecedented heights while putting his next price target for the crypto asset at the pivotal $5,300 level. The analyst’s prognosis indicates that Ethereum, fueled by favorable market circumstances and rising investors’ confidence, is poised for massive gains. This forecast comes at the heel of ETH’s recent robust price performance and increasing market optimism. Ethereum Path To Massive Rally In February, Titan of Crypto hinted at the formation of a Bullish Cypher Pattern on Ethereum‘s weekly chart. “Just like for Bitcoin, a bullish cypher pattern is currently playing out on ETH weekly chart as well,” he stated. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Rally: Far from Over, More Gains Ahead! Due to this, the expert pointed out several targets for the asset to reach in the near term, such as $2,410, $2,881, $3,353, and $4,024, indicating a 38.20%, 50.00%, 61.80%, 78.60% upswingm respectively, from the current price then. Earlier this month, Titan of Crypto noted that the bullish cypher pattern has successfully developed, and the aforementioned price targets have all been achieved, suggesting a substantial rally is on the horizon. At that time, the crypto expert underscored that ETH was at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, which he also dubbed the 1st stop ($2,880). Should the coin manage to sustain this level, Titan of Crypto anticipates a move on the upside from the level. However, today, as predicted by the expert, Ethereum performed a flawless recovery from the 1st stop ($2,880) point. As a result, the crypto asset is currently forming a bull flag pattern on the weekly timeframe, citing $5,300 as the next price target for ETH to reach. However, this is not the final destination, suggesting the potential for Ethereum to surge even higher in the upcoming months. With ETH displaying strong price performance, it could mean that the Altcoin season could be coming into play in the near future. Indicator That Suggests A Price Correction On The Downside Although Titan of Crypto anticipates a massive rally for ETH, Ali Martinez has underlined the potential for the asset to decline soon. According to Ali Martinez, the TD Sequential indicator on Ethereum’s 4-hour timeframe on May 15, previously displayed a promising buy signal. This development practically led to a 32% rise in the price of Ethereum. Related Reading: Expert Sets Timeline For When Ethereum Price Will Begin Rally To $10,000 However, now that the ETH Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are generating so much buzz, the indicator has transitioned to a sell signal. Consequently, Ali Martinez predicts a downward correction of one to four candlesticks. At the time of writing, ETH had increased by over 28% in the past week, trading at around $3,728. Despite the recent price momentum, the asset’s market cap and trading volume are down by 1.56% and 28%, respectively.

U.S President Joe Biden's White House published a statement of administrative policy Wednesday saying the administration opposed the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, citing concerns over a lack of investor protections should it make its way through Congress. The bill also suggested the White House would want to work with Congress on future legislation addressing the crypto markets, in contrast with previous statements from Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has repeatedly said he does not believe the industry needs additional legislation specific to crypto.  ""The Administration is eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets, building on existing authorities, which will promote the responsible development of digital assets and payment innovation and help reinforce United States leadership in the global financial system,"" the statement said. ""H.R. 4763 in its current form lacks sufficient protections for consumers and investors who engage in certain digital asset transactions.""  This is the second statement of administrative policy the administration has published in recent weeks, after threatening a veto against a bill looking to overturn controversial SEC accounting guidance. That bill sailed through the House and Senate.  The statement came hours after the SEC's Gensler published his own opposing statement on the legislation, saying it would harm the regulator's efforts to police traditional capital markets as well as crypto markets.  FIT21 would redefine how securities issuers have to comply with existing federal law and Supreme Court precedent, the SEC chair said in his statement.  The bill's advocates say U.S. law doesn't allow for crypto companies to operate without the threat of civil litigation, a view Gensler described as these companies trying to get out of meeting disclosure and other compliance requirements for securities issuer.  The bill would create a new definition specific to digital assets, to identify when they're securities or digital commodities and whether the SEC or Commodity Futures Trading Commission should be the primary spot market regulator. The full House is set to take up the bill later Wednesday, with a vote scheduled for this afternoon.  ""The Administration looks forward to continued collaboration with Congress on developing legislation for digital assets that includes adequate guardrails for consumers and investors while creating the conditions needed for innovation, and further time will be needed for such collaboration,"" the White House statement on Wednesday concluded.

The most recent dip toward $60,000 saw these large investors gobble up BTC at an alarming rate, with their daily spending coming in at billions of dollars. Bitcoin Whales Buy $6.3 Billion Worth Of BTC In a stunning discovery, co-founder of Bitcoin-based company Apollo, Thomas Fahrer, revealed that Bitcoin whales have been rapidly buying up the tokens amid price drawdown. More specifically, the daily spend of these whales caught Fahrer’s eye. Related Reading: Solana Cup And Handle Pattern Means An At Least 90% Move Against Ethereum, Analyst Says The report shared by the founder shows that while smaller investors had been selling, Bitcoin whales were buying up billions of dollars worth of coins. In the 24-hour period, these whales holding more than 1,000 BTC on their balances accumulated 8,953 BTC, worth $6.3 billion at the time. This further adds to their weekly accumulation numbers, coming out at 12,058 BTC, which is almost $9 billion worth of BTC bought in one week. Whales accumulated $6.3 Billion worth of #Bitcoin Yesterday. So c’mon now, fess up. Who’s selling? pic.twitter.com/3dLD2BI89L — Thomas | heyapollo.com (@thomas_fahrer) May 22, 2024 This accumulation trend comes in light of smaller investors selling their tokens. For example, Fahrer’s screenshot show Sharks, which are investors holding between 100-1,000 BTC on their balances sold 6,746 BTC in one day, worth around $5 billion. Other notable sellers include the crabs, which are investors holding 1-10 BTC, selling 1,074 BTC in the same time period. Shrimps – investors holding 0-1 BTC, were also caught selling, with a total of 591 BTC sold. While Fish investors, those holding 10-100 BTC, sold only 95 BTC in the one day period. The flow of these investors shows that BTC is flowing out from smaller investors toward larger investors, something that is bullish for the price. The same is the case on the weekly timeframe where Shrimps sold 2,079 BTC, Crabs sold 5,748 BTC, Fish sold 1,155 BTC, while Sharks bought up 60 BTC, with Bitcoin whales buying the majority with 12,085 BTC. Time To Buy A number of crypto analysts have called for buying and it seems Bitcoin whales are the ones following this advice. One of the analysts who has been vocal about it being the time to buy is Ali Martinez, who shared an interesting formation on the Bitcoin chart. Related Reading: Why Is The Ethereum Price Up 20% Today? Martinez pointed out that the TD Sequential, which had previously predicted the Bitcoin price movement, had flashed a buy signal. The level at which this analyst presented this buy signal was around the $69,500 level, and since then, the BTC price has since rebounded above $70,000, suggesting the buy signal was correct.

Now, it presents a buy signal, anticipating $BTC will rebound! pic.twitter.com/6ImRkREPVW — Ali (@ali_charts) May 21, 2024 If the TD Sequential holds like it did the last time it appeared, then the current price push could see Bitcoin reach a new all-time high above $74,000, since the last one saw an almost 15% move.

Adler predicts a 300-day bull run fueled by healthy short-term holder profits and a market with plenty of fight left in it. Related Reading: Solana Leaves Competition In The Dust: Blazing Speed To Fuel Price Surge? Profitable Punches And Room For More Adler throws down the gauntlet with data on Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR). This metric reveals if short-term holders are cashing out at a profit. Currently, the 90-day moving average for STH SOPR sits at 1.015, indicating short-term holders are in the green but haven’t reached the knockout blow levels seen in previous bull runs (around 1.06). This suggests there’s room for more profit-taking punches before the bulls grow weary. I’ve already mentioned that the bull market is in full swing. Barring any unforeseen Black Swan events, it could last for approximately another +/- 300 days. This is based on the P&L analysis of Short-Term Holders with a 90-day moving average. pic.twitter.com/30OgsruvOi — Axel 💎🙌 Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 21, 2024 Open Interest: The Untapped Reserve Of Strength Another weapon in the bull’s arsenal is Open Interest (OI), a metric reflecting the total amount of outstanding derivative contracts (futures and options) held by traders. While the recent price surge has been impressive, the 7-day moving average for OI hasn’t witnessed the dramatic rise seen in prior bull runs. This, according to Adler, signifies a hidden reserve of strength in the market, with more firepower waiting to be unleashed. Technical Edge: Bulls Have Momentum On Their Side But technical analysis isn’t just about fancy ratios and cryptic charts. Adler identifies several technical indicators that paint a bullish picture. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a gauge of momentum, hasn’t broken past 70, a level often associated with overbought conditions. This suggests the current rally is healthy and sustainable. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has surged past positive 0.05 territory, indicating significant capital inflow and a growing appetite for Bitcoin among investors. Related Reading: Cardano Breaks Past 200MA, Analyst ‘Insanely’ Bullish on ADA Can The Bulls KO Resistance Levels? While the bulls seem to have the upper hand, there are still hurdles to overcome.

However, if the current momentum continues, these resistance levels could be shattered, paving the way for a potential retest of the all-time high at $73,700 and a possible upward motion beyond.

42418118,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcfDp,1716382800,"On-Chain Ads Are Finally Here, in a Win for Privacy and User Experience","""Ads"" are a bad word in the cryptocurrency community, yet (almost) everything in crypto is an ad.  NFT mint links inside wallets are ads: the referring wallet app will make a cut of the minting fees. That link in your Discord or Telegram channel to a new decentralized exchange is an ad: the poster is getting upwards of 10% of your protocol fees via a referral program. Every memecoin is an exquisitely precise ad, a self-measuring barometer of attention: the price jumps if people talk about the memecoin and drops if they don’t.  Antonio Garcia Martinez is the founder and CEO of Spindl and author of ""Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley."" This opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's Web3 Marketing Week, presented by Cookie3.  Crypto is more spiritually ads-focused than it realizes, and more than Web2 was when it was born. I was there at Facebook when the IPO rolled around and suddenly monetization mattered; it was all built as a desperate afterthought to pay the server costs and please investors.  Crypto, meanwhile, has been busily inventing (or at least rebranding) channels for user growth: quests, airdrops, points system, and more. There has been very little built in the way of on-chain ads technology however. A couple of self-styled ""Web3 ad networks"" are really just very basic Web2 ad tech being run on crypto-focused publishers: the banner ad running over a block explorer like Etherscan or a token price charting website, nothing more.  But something new is afoot, which will radically change all that: Web3 consumer is finally happening. Farcaster, the decentralized social network, is happening, its many clients likeWarpcast,Supercast, andPhaver are happening. Coinbase Smart Wallets that easily issue a wallet with a social login are happening. Onboarding services Privy andDynamic and embedded wallets are also happening. Perhaps biggest of all, Telegram is building native wallet support into its immensely popular messaging app which boasts almost 1 billion active users. Now we’re talking real numbers, numbers that rival Web2 platforms.  UX improves…  What this means from a marketing perspective is that while most of the on-chain action so far has been at the end of the user journey—a user lands on a project’s page from somewhere off-chain, connects a wallet, and only then transacts—the top of the user funnel is finally on-chain too. The apps baking wallets into their user experiences will of course be using them to transact on-chain, which enables a whole new class of sponsored content.  By ""ads,"" of course, I don’t mean the hideous and annoying banner ads or mobile pop-ups of Web2. I mean in-context, native, and relevant sponsored calls-to-action like the ones you’re starting to see in the ""Explore"" or ""Perks"" tab of just about every wallet app, from Coinbase to MetaMask and all the rest. Wallets are suddenly in a ruthlessly competitive market and simply offering token swaps isn’t enough anymore: they’re slowly but surely crafting themselves into the portals for Web3, which means social and discovery feeds (and yes, ads).  Consider this: What would Amazon pay for a one-click ad that lets you buy the product you abandoned in an Amazon shopping cart, all while browsing The New York Times? It would pay billions and billions for it, given the impact on conversion rates. But such a thing can’t be built using legacy Web2 technology (the closest we have is TikTok shopping that uses Apple Pay for identity and payment).  With the blockchain managing identity and payment, such interactive ads can be so easily built that everyone and their brother is doing so. They're called Frames and launched on Farcaster in February. There are so many of these things running that Warpcast (the largest Farcaster client) hasa Frames-specific feed just to see them all.  Now imagine similar user experiences, inside a consumer app, correctly targeted via a wallet-based audience informed by on-chain transactions, and paid for by payment rails that accept your protocol token. Imagine that anyone can be a publisher: every Discord or Telegram channel mod can finally get paid for the thankless task of maintaining large communities. In true crypto fashion, the rent-seeking incumbents of the past like Facebook and Google will be replaced by the decentralized coordination mechanism of the blockchain and growth protocols built thereon. Suddenly, the makings of the same marketing flywheel that grew trillion-dollar companies in Web2 materialize in Web3.  …and so does privacy  What of user privacy?  Gone will be cookies (and the cookie warnings), the sketchy device fingerprinting, the data brokers reselling your off-chain data, endless client-side software development kits on browsers and in mobile apps relaying what users do, and useless-seeming opt-out and delete-data buttons that never quite seem to turn off the retargeted ads in your feed.  Instead, users will be fully in control of their online identities which they may functionally delete by spinning up a new wallet. Or not! They’ll keep a public-facing social wallet with all their NFTs, or a degen wallet with their trades, and see a torrent of offered airdrops, rebates, and points everywhere they go. Users, not middlemen, will be in control, however.  Apps with wallets in them, from Telegram to Warpcast, are starting to do real numbers. When the scale of monthly active crypto users approaches the magnitude of fully-diluted crypto valuations, you can't count on ever-increasing token prices to cover costs. Which is fine – AWS doesn’t take crypto anyway. Scaled Web3 consumer apps will have to monetize in ways that don’t alienate users, while still going beyond the rudimentary mechanisms they possess today.  On-chain won’t be the new ""online"" any other way.

The zkEVM, called Kakarot, already in testing, will be available via the Starknet Stack, a set of software tools that make it easier for developers to spin up their own customized application-specific chains.  Starknet already has its own zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM), but using a programming language called Cairo. With the zkEVM, developers will instead be able to code with Solidity, the most common programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, making the Starknet blockchain more accessible to a broader array of project builders.  Kakarot is currently in a “public whitelist” phase, according to a press release seen by CoinDesk. This means that only a select few developers will have access to the Kakarot zkEVM before it hits mainnet, to test out new protocol changes.  “This is a great sign of Starknet’s growth and maturity,"" said the CEO of StarkWare, Eli Ben-Sasson, in a statement to CoinDesk. ""Starknet dared to be different, and use the powerful Cairo language, instead of Solidity. At the same time, some developers want the zkEVM approach, and for that reason, this is excellent news for the network.”  The announcement comes as StarkWare recently shared that it will be coming out with a new cryptographic prover, called “Stwo.”  Read more: StarkWare Unveils New 'Stwo' Cryptographic Prover That's 'Blazingly Fast'",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/22/layer-2-network-starknet-gets-ethereum-virtual-machine-with-zero-knowledge-proofs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/645e2f4365f470d83de3e2a6b2f4f2e3bcc893c1-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418164,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTchor,1716379748,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Hovers Around $70K After ETF Records Month-High Inflows,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin hovered around the $70,000 mark during the European morning, a slight drop following Tuesday's rally to as high as $71,400. BTC is currently priced at $70,069, around 1.6% lower over 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), offering a measurement of the broader digital asset market, fell about 0.5%. BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded over $290 million in inflows on Tuesday, its highest one-day figure since April 5 and nearly three times the previous high this month: $93 million on May 16. As a whole, ETFs took on nearly $300 million in net inflows on Tuesday.  Ether's market cap rose by over $70 billion on Tuesday, not far off the entire market value of Solana's sol token at around $80 billion. The ether price surged more than 19% on Monday for a total of $439 billion, according to data source TradingView. The surge followed renewed hopes that a spot ether ETF will be approved in the U.S. Analysts say the gap between ether and rivals like SOL will widen in the coming months as a potential spot ETF launch opens the token to mainstream institutional adoption. At the time of writing, ETH is priced at $3,726, a decrease of just over 0.8% in the last 24 hours.  WisdomTree has been given the green light to list bitcoin and ether ETPs on the London Stock Exchange. The asset manager said it was among the first applicants to have its prospectus given the go-ahead by the FCA. The Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) and Physical Ethereum (ETHW) ETPs are expected to start trading on May 28 and will be available only to professional investors. They will carry fees of 35 basis points. The FCA said in March it would not object to requests from financial institutions seeking to list ETPs for professional investors, a partial lift on the ban it put in place in 2020. The products however remain out of bounds for retail investors.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the share of BTC/USDT trading that occurred during the U.S. hours (13:00 to 20:00 UTC) in the first four months of the year, starting from 2015.  The U.S. share has steadily increased, reaching a record high of 46% in 2024 as the debut of spot ETFs in the U.S. opened the doors to mainstream institutional adoption.  ""The new ETFs calculate their net asset value (NAV) against dedicated benchmarks at the US close each weekday, thereby boosting arbitrage and price discovery,"" Paris-based Kaiko said in the weekly newsletter, explaining the concentration of activity during the American hours.

After BTC price surged from below $66,000 to almost $72,000 at the beginning of the week, Bollinger, the creator of the widely utilized Bollinger Bands indicator, pointed to specific features in the Bitcoin price chart that suggest a consolidation or pullback could be imminent, though he clarified that his perspective was not bearish on a longer term. The Bearish Argument By John Bollinger Bollinger’s analysis focuses on the daily BTC/USD chart. His main concern centers around a “two-bar reversal” pattern observed at the upper Bollinger Band. This pattern, typically indicating a potential reversal in price direction, occurs when Bitcoin’s price first exceeds the upper Bollinger Band but then closes within it during the next trading period. Such movements can imply that the upward momentum might be losing strength. The Bollinger Bands on the chart consist of three lines: the lower band, the middle band (20-day simple moving average), and the upper band. These bands expand and contract based on price volatility, with the upper and lower bands set two standard deviations away from the middle band. The Bitcoin price peaked at approximately $71,977 on Tuesday, momentarily pushing above the upper Bollinger Band before closing back within it, forming the noted reversal pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar To Highest Level In Months As BTC Price Surges Past $68,000 Further analysis shows the 20-day moving average, the middle Bollinger Band, which currently sits at about $64,564 and acts as a potential support level in the event of a price decline. Historical data from the chart indicates crucial resistance near the recent highs around $71,500, while support levels could be seen around the $64,500 mark, where the middle Bollinger Band lies, and further at $58,300, coinciding with the lower band. The expansion of the Bollinger Bands indicates increased market volatility, particularly as the price tests resistance levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently just at 63, which is not yet in the overbought territory. In his commentary, Bollinger has clearly stated that while the setup is not fundamentally bearish, the observed technical pattern warrants caution for short-term traders. He advises monitoring for either a consolidation period where the price stabilizes, or a pullback where it retreats from recent highs. “I am not fond of the two-bar reversal at the upper Bollinger Band for BTCUSD. Suggests a consolidation or a pullback. Not bearish here, just short-term concerned,” Bollinger remarked. The Bullish Argument On the contrary, renowned crypto analyst, Josh Olszewicz (@CarpeNoctom), shared a bullish outlook on Bitcoin through a different lens, focusing on the Ichimoku Cloud indicator in the daily chart. He highlighted a “Bullish TK Cross with Price Above Cloud” on the daily Bitcoin chart. Related Reading: Analyst Says $71,000 Bitcoin Move Is Only Halfway Through, Here’s Why This particular pattern is significant within the realm of technical analysis, especially for those employing the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator, a comprehensive tool that provides insights into market momentum, trend direction, and support and resistance levels. The “Bullish TK Cross” Olszewicz refers to occurs when the Tenkan-sen line (a short-term moving average) crosses above the Kijun-sen line (a medium-term moving average), indicating a potential uptrend. Typically, this crossover suggests that buying momentum is increasing and can signal the start of a bullish phase. The significance of this bullish signal is further enhanced by the fact that the price of Bitcoin is above the “Cloud” or ‘Kumo’, which is considered an area of future support or resistance. When the price is above the cloud, it’s generally viewed as a bullish signal, suggesting that the asset is in a strong uptrend and likely to continue as such. This setup provides a clear bullish scenario that contrasts with the short-term caution suggested by John Bollinger’s analysis. At press time, BTC traded at $69,846.

Traders have snapped up ether calls at the $5,000 strike and higher this week.  The price of ether {{ETH}} has a 20% chance of rallying to $5,000 by the end of next month, data from the decentralized options marketplace Lyra indicates. The price peaked at $4,692 during the previous bull market, according to CoinDesk data.  To hit the new record, ether would need to rise by about a third from the current level around $3,740. That would follow this week's more than 20% surge spurred by sudden optimism that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  ""Lyra options markets are implying a ~20% chance of ETH reaching $5,000 by June 28,"" Nick Forster, Lyra's founder and a former Wall Street options trader, told CoinDesk in an email. ""There is a 20% chance of ETH moving above $5,500 by July 26, as traders have increased positioning post the ETF speculation.""  Lyra is a decentralized settlement protocol for spot, perpetuals and options trading. In the past 24 hours, the protocol registered a crypto options trading volume of $1.33 million, accounting for over 50% of the global decentralized finance (DeFi) options tally of $2.08 million, according to data source DeFiLlama. Traders from Lyra correctly predicted BTC's first-quarter rally and the April peak near $70,000.  Options are derivative contracts that give their holders the flexibility to buy or sell the underlying asset in the future at a price agreed upon today. A call gives the right to buy, and a put option offers the right to sell. Traders typically buy call options to profit from or hedge against price rallies and prefer puts when anticipating a price drop.  This week, Lyra-based traders have snapped up ether call options expiring in June and July at strikes above $5,000, revealing a bullish outlook.  “The ETH ETF approval should have an outsized effect on ETH relative to Bitcoin. ETH is starting from a market cap that is roughly one-third of what Bitcoin's was prior to the ETF being priced in,"" Forster said. “This should drive more volumes to options as traders play the ETF approval event and position for volatile markets without being subject to liquidation (on the long side).""

Invesco's product prospectus was also approved by the Financial Conduct Authority.  The listings follow the first approvals by FCA since it relaxed its stance on crypto ETPs, having banned them in 2020.  The London Stock Exchange (LSE) will list crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) for the first time later this month after prospectuses from WisdomTree (WT) and 21Shares were approved by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  WisdomTree (WT), based in New York, won approval to list its Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) and Physical Ethereum (ETHW) ETPs, which it expects to start trading on May 28. Zurich-based 21Shares was approved for bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} products and may start trading around the same time. A prospectus from Invesco was also approved, though the firm has made no further comment.  Approval in the U.K. comes several months after the January green light for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. Similar products have been trading in various European jurisdictions for several years. Both WisdomTree and 21Shares were among the firms to have spot ETFs approved in the U.S. in January.  The FCA said in March it would not to object to requests from financial institutions seeking to list ETPs for professional investors. The LSE confirmed it would accept applications for bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} products in the second quarter. Unlike products in Europe and the U.S., however, the FCA is allowing the London ETPs to be available only to professional investors.  The FCA introduced a ban on crypto derivatives products including ETPs in January 2020. However, with such products being widely available in Europe for several years and following the U.S. spot ETFs listing approvals, the regulator adjusted its stance. It is keeping the ban in place for retail investors.  WisdomTree's products will carry fees of 35 basis points, while 21Shares has not disclosed theirs as yet.

28260633,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609233,1716368405,"Cardano Breaks Past 200MA, Analyst ‘Insanely’ Bullish on ADA","Cardano (ADA), the native token of the smart contracts platform, has been a hot topic in crypto circles this week. The surge in price and trading activity has analysts like Sssebi predicting a potential bull run for ADA, citing key technical indicators and a shift in market sentiment. Related Reading: Solana Leaves Competition In The Dust: Blazing Speed To Fuel Price Surge? Breaking Through Resistance, Bouncing Back Stronger Sssebi, a well-respected crypto analyst, recently published a detailed report highlighting ADA’s recent bullish behavior. One of the key factors Sssebi points to is the token’s successful climb above the crucial 200-day moving average (200MA) on the 4-hour chart. The 200MA is a widely used technical indicator that reflects the long-term trend of an asset. Traditionally, a price moving above the 200MA is seen as a bullish signal, suggesting a potential shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. $ADA gets a nice bounce of the 200MA on the 4hr chart with increased volume! Bullish! Since it hit 0.80$ $ADA was not able to get above this moving average and now it has broken it, came back and retested and bounced with high volume! Insanely bullish on $ADA right now! https://t.co/YCcGY13ZSp pic.twitter.com/QyatkiCx4k — Sssebi🦁 (@Av_Sebastian) May 21, 2024 But Sssebi’s analysis goes beyond the initial breakout. He emphasizes the significance of the retest and subsequent bounce back from the 200MA with high trading volume. This price action, according to Sssebi, suggests a robust buying force behind ADA. The previous resistance level, once a hurdle for further gains, may now act as a strong support floor, preventing sharp price drops. Volume Surge Fuels Optimism Another key element in Sssebi’s bullish outlook is the significant increase in trading volume accompanying ADA’s recent price rise. Trading volume is a crucial indicator of market interest and investor sentiment. High volume suggests a larger number of market participants are actively involved in buying and selling ADA, lending credence to the price movement. In the case of ADA, the high volume surge alongside the bounce off the 200MA strengthens Sssebi’s belief in a potential uptrend. The analyst’s insights have resonated with the crypto community, with many traders and investors keeping a close eye on Cardano’s developments. Sssebi’s bullish view is primarily based on technical indicators and recent market activity, suggesting the possibility of further price appreciation for ADA. However, the article published by Sssebi also underscores the importance of conducting independent research before making any investment decisions. Related Reading: XRP: Social Buzz Points To $0.70, But Technicals Predict Dip To $0.50 First Cardano: Fundamentals And Ecosystem Growth While Sssebi’s analysis paints a promising technical picture for ADA, the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory will likely depend on a broader set of factors.

The successful launch of smart contracts last year marked a significant milestone, and upcoming developments like the Vasil Hard Fork, aimed at improving network scalability and transaction fees, are eagerly awaited by the community.

42418146,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTchfZ,1716368400,"SEC's Gensler Says House Bill Would 'Undermine' Regulator's Crypto, Capital Markets Oversight","The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act would hurt investors and hamper the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's work, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said Wednesday.  ""The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act ('FIT 21') would create new regulatory gaps and undermine decades of precedent regarding the oversight of investment contracts, putting investors and capital markets at immeasurable risk,"" he said.  FIT21 is a joint bill produced by the House Agriculture Committee and the House Financial Services Committee, and is intended to clarify how the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversee crypto. It creates a ""digital commodity"" term for digital assets that do not meet the bill's definition of a security, placing those assets under the CFTC's purview.  According to Gensler, FIT21 ignores long-standing precedent for how investment contracts are regulated, puts the agency into a tough position for certifying self-proclaimed digital commodity issuers, ignores Supreme Court precedent in the Howey Test, removes investor protections and potentially allows investors to take on excessive risk without appropriate disclosures.  U.S. securities laws were developed after the Great Depression to protect consumers by forcing disclosures and giving both the regulator and investors tools to safeguard customers, Gensler said. Crypto industry participants have not been willing to comply with these regulations, he said.  ""The bill would remove investment contracts that are recorded on a blockchain from  the statutory definition of securities and the time-tested protections of much of the federal  securities laws,"" he said. ""By removing this set of investment contracts from the statutory list of securities, the bill implies what courts have repeatedly ruled – but what crypto market participants have attempted to deny – that many crypto assets are being offered and sold as securities under existing law.""  While the bill includes a provision for companies to self-certify that they're issuing ""digital commodities,"" it gives the SEC 60 days to assess whether those assets meet the bill's definition of a digital commodity. That is not enough time given just how many digital assets are circulating, he said.  Gensler also took aim at how the bill defined a digital commodity, saying it ignored the Howey Test precedent and the economic realities of assets. Between that, the investor protection framework the bill sets in place for crypto investors and the exclusion of exchanges, the bill may ""increase risk to the American public,"" he said.  FIT21 might also harm the U.S.'s broader capital markets, Gensler said, by letting companies try to avoid SEC oversight by using some sort of decentralized network.  The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill later on Wednesday, though it does not currently have a clear road through the Senate and is unlikely to become a law this year.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/22/secs-gensler-says-house-bill-would-undermine-regulators-crypto-capital-markets-oversight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9dd81746734e4ffb53f9892fd5ea45a60941be7-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418154,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTchkj,1716364477,Ether Market Cap Adds Close to an Entire Solana Blockchain in a Single Day,"Ether's market value rose by over $70 billion Monday, nearly matching SOL's total market value of around $80 billion.  Analysts expect the gap between ETH and its rivals like SOL to widen further in the coming months.  The market capitalization of programmable blockchain Solana's sol {{SOL}} token could exceed that of rival Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} during the next bullish cycle, one crypto observer said in December.  This week, the market has shown how Herculean the task would be: The ether price surged more than 19% on Monday, adding $70 billion to its market cap for a total of $439 billion, according to data source TradingView. That's a gain equivalent to almost 90% of SOL's market value in just one day.  The surge followed renewed hopes that a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) will be approved in the U.S. Analysts say the gap between ether and its rivals like SOL will widen in the coming months as a potential spot ETF launch open the token to mainstream institutional adoption. So far, only bitcoin has had that privilege.  At press time, ether was the world's second-largest digital asset, boasting a market cap of $453 billion, exceeded only by bitcoin's {{BTC}} $1.38 trillion. Sol, meanwhile, ranked fifth with a market value of $82 billion.  ""Near-term ETH outlook is incredibly bullish.Let's not overcomplicate it,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email. ""The ETF announcement is a near black swan even to (most) investors, markets dramatically short-to-underweight ETH, much of ETH liquidity is locked in staking, and the macro backdrop is favourable,""  Since its inception in 2015, Ethereum has been the world's leading smart contract blockchain, powering over 4,000 decentralized applications. It's home to some of the most critical decentralized finance protocols like Uniswap, AAVE and tokenization initiatives like BlackRock's BUIDL. Moreover, Ethereum has never experienced a Solana-like outage.  Still, there have been instances, particularly during bull runs, when traders shifted to Solana to bypass Ethereum's network congestion and higher transactions costs. For instance, Solana's share in global trading volume on decentralized exchanges rose early this year thanks to the meme coin frenzy. That spurred talks of SOL eventually overtaking ETH.

42418162,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTchpt,1716362154,Donald Trump-Themed Meme Coins Breed Crypto Millionaires as MAGA Token Surged,"The surge of the TRUMP token, which is not directly linked to Donald Trump, has created a new class of millionaires in the PoliFi crypto sector.  The Trump campaign announced it would begin to accept crypto donations, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and meme coins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB).  The young PoliFi crypto sector, a frontier wherepolitics, finance, and cryptocurrency converge, has minted a new class of millionaires as a token themed after Donald Trump surged in the past few weeks, analysis by on-chain data provider Nansen shows.  While the issuance of the TRUMP token has nothing to do with the former U.S. President Donald Trump directly, traders are using the tokens as a speculative bet on his ongoing presidential campaign.  In the past two weeks, the Trump MAGA (TRUMP) token is up nearly 75%, according to CoinGecko data. It surged 14% on Tuesday as the Trump campaign said it would begin to accept crypto donations, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and meme coins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB).  From all this, some holders of the MAGA meme coin – the first experiment in a new category of tokens called PoliFi, which has a collective market cap of $749 million – have seen returns of over 1,600%.  One such address is sitting on over $5.5 million worth of the token.  Several addresses purchased low six-figures in TRUMP tokens and are now sitting on unrealized gains of over $1 million. They are gradually trimming their holdings but not selling in a manner that could cause a sudden price dump. As such, these sales were made before Tuesday’s campaign donation announcement.  However, recent buyers of the TRUMP token are posting a poor return on investment and have a low overall win rate, the data showed.  Meanwhile, the value of TRUMP holdings sent to a wallet linked to the actual Donald Trump has risen to nearly $5 million.  A wallet supposedly linked to Trump received $7,100 of TRUMP from the meme coin’s developers between August and October 2023.  Sending tokens to a wallet linked to popular entities is sometimes used as a marketing strategy by meme coin makers, as they can attract eyeballs – and galvanize investor interest.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,"Shaurya Malwa, Sam Reynolds",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/22/donald-trump-themed-meme-coins-breed-crypto-millionaires-as-maga-token-surged,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff8449562a64f2870e1364d441bd121f62315332-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Policy Week  The narrative  Consensus, CoinDesk's annual conference, kicks off next Wednesday in Austin, Texas. We'll have a number of policymakers and industry participants engaging in the policy world. We have a few sessions on Wednesday, May 29, and Friday, May 31, but the bulk of this will take place on Thursday, May 30, when we hold our annual Policy Summit.  Why it matters  The policy summit is focused on, well, policy issues. And they're important. On Tuesday alone, we saw an intense discussion about a pending House vote on possibly the first crypto market structure bill to make it through one of Congress' legislative bodies, the possibility that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission might approve spot ether exchange-traded funds, and Uniswap Labs' response to a Wells Notice sent to it by the SEC.  Clearly, there's a lot going on. My goal is to see what we can learn from our panels of speakers next week.  Breaking it down  CoinDesk is holding its annual Policy Summit stage at Consensus 2024 next week in Austin, Texas (still need a ticket? Coupon code below!).  During the policy summit, we'll hear from SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger, Sen. Bill Hagerty and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, representatives from the IRS and Senate candidates.  The agenda includes issues such as the upcoming U.S. election, current policy within key regulatory agencies, the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets framework, taxes, and more. The crypto industry has discussed or tried to lobby on each of these issues over the past few years, and we'll see more engagement on them in the coming days.  We're kicking the summit off with Commissioners Peirce and Mersinger. I'll moderate this opening session with the commissioners before we turn things over to my colleague Camomile for a session on MiCA and its implementation later this year. Jesse Hamilton and Cheyenne Ligon are also set to moderate important discussions through the course of the day.  Outside of the main policy summit, we're also going to hear from senior policy officials, like Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee. We'll talk about issues like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's proposed rulemaking designating mixers as primary money laundering concerns, and a panel focused on mixers and privacy will delve into both ongoing legal cases against developers and the broader issue of balancing the right to transact privately with the very real concern that illicit actors – like certain rogue nations – might be taking advantage of privacy tools for malign ends.  We'll talk about the role corporate monitors might play in crypto moving forward, after Binance's landmark settlement with U.S. officials that will see it reporting to a monitor for the next few years.  Panelists will look at how central bank digital currencies are actually being developed and used in countries around the world, separating hypothetical concerns from practical realities.  Representatives from the IRS will walk through what they're doing now to further develop the tax agency's approach to digital assets, and another speaker will discuss the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's global crypto tax reporting framework.  Crypto broker Prometheum will take us over its soft launch of a custody service, what that means for the industry and where it's going next.  Senate candidates Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) and John Deaton (R-Mass.) will take the stage, as will presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. And we'll hear from many more policy – and other – speakers over the course of the event.  I'm moderating conversations with Senators Wyden and Hagerty, Commissioners Peirce and Mersinger and Under Secretary Nelson. If you have a question you think may be interesting, feel free to respond to this email and send those my way. I might ask the best ones on stage.

28255771,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609223,1716360603,"Ethereum Co-Founder Predicts Supply Crunch From ETFs, This Is The Price Target","Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of blockchain technology firm Consensys, has expressed that the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could lead to significant supply constraints for Ether. This development is anticipated to be a “watershed” moment for Ethereum. In an exclusive interview with DL News, Lubin predicted that the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs will unlock substantial institutional demand. Given that many institutions have begun their crypto investments with spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum is naturally the next substantial asset for diversification. “There’s going to be a pretty large amount of natural, pent-up pressure to purchase Ether” through these ETFs, Lubin commented. However, he also noted that the situation for Ethereum differs significantly from that of Bitcoin because of the underlying supply dynamics. A major factor distinguishing Ethereum from Bitcoin in the context of ETF creation is the availability of the assets. On-chain data indicates that more than 27% of all Ether is staked across various protocols on the Ethereum network. These funds are locked in contracts and are contributing to the network’s security and operations, thus they are not readily available for market trading. “Much of the Ether is put to work in the core protocol, DeFi systems, or in DAOs,” Lubin explained. This structural difference means that there is less Ether available for ETF providers to purchase and allocate to new ETF shares. Related Reading: Ethereum Soars 20%: ETH Hype Escalates on ETF Rumors In August 2021, the Ethereum network’s EIP 1559 introduced a burning mechanism where a portion of the Ether used for transaction fees is permanently removed from circulation. This deflationary mechanism is designed to balance Ether supply growth and potentially increase its scarcity over time. As network activity increases—potentially spurred further by new institutional interest in Ethereum through ETFs—this burn mechanism will gradually reduce the available supply, adding another layer to the potential supply crunch. “This could be a pretty profound watershed moment”, Lubin said. Ethereum Price Targets And Doubts The market impact of an approved Ethereum spot ETF could be significant. Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher projected a possible scenario where Ethereum could see a price surge similar to that experienced by Bitcoin following its own ETF approval. According to Deutscher’s analysis, “BTC rallied 75% in 63 days after the spot ETF was approved. If ETH follows the same trend (if approved), this would take it to $6,446 by July 23.” $BTC rallied 75% in 63 days after the spot ETF was approved. If $ETH follows the same trend (if approved), this would take it to $6,446 by July 23. pic.twitter.com/FfWg9VGUMx — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) May 21, 2024 However, opinions among analysts vary. Vetle Lunde from K33 Research pointed out the challenges in replicating Bitcoin’s success, noting that the futures-based Ethereum ETFs have only captured a small fraction of the assets compared to their Bitcoin counterparts prior to spot ETF approval. “Fut-based ETH ETFs have seen cumulative net inflows of $126m since launch ~ roughly equivalent to the inflow to BITX over the past 3 days. Fut-based ETH ETFs aggregated AUM is only 7.4% of the AUM fut-based BTC ETFs had before the spot approval,” he remarked. Related Reading: Crypto Market Liquidations Top $330 Million In 24 Hours With Ethereum In The Lead Meanwhile, crypto analyst Vijay Boyapati raised concerns about the structural differences in ETFs, specifically the inability of ETF structures to incorporate staking. “It should be noted that the ETH ETFs, if approved, will be a much worse proxy for the underlying asset than BTC ETFs because the SEC is still extremely unlikely to allow the ETF applicants to stake,” he said. This could result in the ETFs not fully reflecting the underlying value growth of Ethereum price, as also highlighted by Alex Thorn, Head of Research at crypto-focused financial services firm Galaxy commented: “Lack of staking in ETH ETPs would be material for returns. If u bought $10k ETH on Merge day in Sep ‘22 and held until today without staking it, you underperformed by 8% over that period vs someone who bought and staked to collect issuance, tips, and MEV.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,759.

There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.480 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if there is a close above $0.500. Cardano Price Remains Supported In the past few days, Cardano started a recovery wave from the $0.4620 zone, but lagged behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA price broke the $0.4750 and $0.480 levels to move into a short-term bullish zone. The price even spiked above $0.50 but it failed to continue higher. A high was formed at $0.510 and recently there was a downside correction. The price declined below the $0.4980 support.

There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.480 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair.

The first resistance is near $0.510. The next key resistance might be $0.5250. If there is a close above the $0.5250 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.5450 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.5650. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.4980 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.450 level. The next major support is near the $0.480 level. A downside break below the $0.480 level could open the doors for a test of $0.4620. The next major support is near the $0.450 level.

28245801,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=609194,1716345013,UNI Price Soars 20% As Uniswap Labs Pushes Back Against SEC’s Wells Notice,"Uniswap Labs, the creator of one of the largest decentralized trading platforms, is challenging a potential enforcement action by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing that crypto tokens should not be classified as securities. The New York-based firm recently refuted the allegation that it operated as an unregistered exchange and broker-dealer. This response follows the SEC’s issuance of a Wells Notice to Uniswap Labs, signaling its intent to recommend legal action against the company. Uniswap Labs Challenges SEC’s Claims In a 40-page filing submitted to the SEC, Uniswap Labs outlined numerous reasons why the agency’s pursuit of legal action should be reconsidered. The SEC’s claims are primarily based on the assumption that all tokens are securities, a premise that Uniswap Labs disputes. Related Reading: Institutional Investors Pour $942 Million Into Bitcoin, Will This Trigger A Rally To $80,000? Marvin Ammori, Chief Legal Officer of Uniswap Labs, emphasized that tokens are merely a file format for value and not inherently securities. He criticized the SEC’s attempt to redefine the terms “exchange,” “broker,” and “investment contract” to encompass Uniswap’s operations. This year, the SEC has taken action against numerous crypto firms through Wells notices, lawsuits, or settlements. The commission’s scrutiny has increasingly focused on Ethereum and decentralized finance players, including Uniswap, ShapeShift, TradeStation, and Consensys. Additionally, reports suggest that the Ethereum Foundation is under investigation. Distinction Between Tokens And Securities Uniswap Labs believes that the SEC’s case against them is flawed. It fails to recognize the distinction between tokens as files for value and tokens as securities. If the SEC proceeds with a lawsuit accusing Uniswap Labs of operating as an unregistered exchange, it risks facing adverse consequences regarding its authority over crypto tokens. Uniswap Labs warned that such litigation could set a precedent undermining the SEC’s ongoing rulemaking efforts. The company expressed its willingness to litigate if necessary and expressed confidence in a favorable outcome, stating: But we’re prepared to fight. Our lawyers are 2-0 in high-profile SEC cases. Andrew Ceresney, a former head of enforcement at the SEC, represented Ripple in their victory over the SEC. Don Verrilli, a former U.S. solicitor general, has argued more than 50 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and represented Grayscale in its successful case against the SEC. Related Reading: Why Is The Ethereum Price Up 20% Today? SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has consistently maintained that decentralized exchanges are not genuinely decentralized and should fall under the regulator’s purview. Gensler has also argued that many digital assets qualify as unregistered securities subject to SEC regulations. Uniswap Labs, in its response, contended that its governance token, UNI, does not meet the requirements of the Howey Test, a legal framework used to evaluate investment contracts. The company also disputed the SEC’s classification of LP tokens, which are used as securities for liquidity provision in Uniswap pools. Uniswap Labs asserted that LP tokens are accounting tools rather than investment instruments. Uniswap’s native token UNI has seen significant gains of nearly 20% in the last 24 hours alone, as the market rebounded from a two-month consolidation period to trade at $9.34.

The price is now correcting gains and might remain strong above the 100-hourly SMA. XRP extended its increase above the $0.5450 resistance zone.

There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5330 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair is correcting gains, but there could be a fresh increase unless there is a close below the 100-hourly SMA. XRP Price Holds Ground After a close above the $0.520 level, XRP price remained in a positive zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It cleared the $0.5320 and $0.5450 resistance levels. There was also a spike above the $0.550 level. A new weekly high was formed at $0.5571, and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $0.5450 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.5065 swing low to the $0.5571 high. It is now trading above $0.530 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5330 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. Immediate resistance is near the $0.5380 level. The first key resistance is near $0.5450. A close above the $0.5450 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.5570. If the bulls push the price above the $0.5570 resistance level, there could be a steady increase toward the $0.5650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5720 resistance. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5450 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5330 level and the trend line. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.5065 swing low to the $0.5571 high. The next major support is at $0.5250. The main support is now near $0.5185. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5185 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could drop and test the $0.5065 support in the near term.

After a Q1 full of bullish sentiment, Q2 saw many sectors of the crypto space brewing a pessimistic feeling toward altcoins. Related Reading: Why Is The Ethereum Price Up 20% Today? Experts and market watchers have reassured investors that the price corrections were part of the cycle, predicting that the bullish rally would resume after the cool-off. Now, analysts consider that altcoins are about to embark on a “massive leg higher” for the alt season. Ethereum’s Surge Refuels Sentiment The crypto market is up by 8.3%, with a market capitalization of $2.55 trillion. This market surge has seen Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, soar past $70,000 in the last day. Similarly, the “king of altcoins” remarkably performed these past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH)’s price has risen 22% since yesterday, surpassing levels not seen since mid-March. However, ETH is yet to test its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, set nearly two years ago. As a result, the second-largest cryptocurrency has been criticized this cycle for being “a major disappointment.” In a turn of events, rumors of an approval of ETH spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have refueled investors’ bullish tank, “erasing 65 days of down only” with a single daily candle. As ETH rallies, analysts believe it’s only a matter of time before the whole altcoins sector surges to kick off the altcoin season. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted the ‘Crypto Money Flow Cycle’, stating that, now that BTC and ETH have rallied, “it’s time for Altcoins to rally.” Is The Altcoins Season Here? During the slowdowns, market watchers have analyzed altcoins’ run this cycle. Altcoin Sherpa has stated that many tokens didn’t “run that hard” during round 1 of the bull run, resulting in his forecast of a 1-4 months “cool-off” period before resuming the uptrend. Despite the similarities with previous bull runs, the singularities of this cycle, like the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Memecoin pre-sale frenzy, have made investors question whether they would see the alt season this time. Nonetheless, several analysts, who urged investors not to panic before, suggest the community prepares for the “maniac phase” ahead. Crypto Yoddha shared his chart for the 2024 altcoin cycle, stating that the dip was “just a higher low in an uptrend.” Per the chart, the altcoins market is now looking to retest the $1.27 trillion resistance level seen in March before testing last cycle’s $1.7 trillion ATH. To crypto Yoddha, “we’re looking at the bullish continuation” that will lead to a new market ATH during round 2. Similarly, Top analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who recently sold all his BTC for Altcoins, stated that the Altcoin market capitalization has finished its correction: The next step: reaching all-time high, which is ~60-70% from here. I think #Ethereum is likely reaching that in the next 2-4 months.

Following a pattern similar to the previous cycle, where DOGE experienced a retracement after breaking out from a descending pattern before rallying, the asset has recently completed a significant 47% retracement. This movement has led Ali to highlight the market’s tendency to echo past patterns, though not perfectly. With the breakout from the descending pattern and subsequent retracement now complete, DOGE is positioning itself for another push toward the $0.2 resistance level. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes!! https://t.co/qr9BG5QnjH — Ali (@ali_charts) May 21, 2024 This level has proven challenging, with selling pressure frequently intensifying around this range. However, the broader market sentiment remains bullish, which could support Dogecoin’s push toward this key price point. Notably, to reach $0.2, DOGE would need to increase further by nearly 20% from its current position. Currently, the memecoin is trading at $0.168, reflecting a 10% increase over the past 24 hours and continuing a week-long uptrend that has seen nearly a 15% increase. Surging Interest In Dogecoin And Strong Upside Signal The positive movement in DOGE’s price performance is further underscored by a surge in DOGE’s open interest, which has risen by 23% in the past day to reach $1 billion, according to data from Coinglass. Additionally, the open interest volume has soared by 200%, now at nearly $4 billion. An increase in open interest indicates that new market participants are entering or existing positions are being expanded. This can be a sign of strengthening market activity and a supportive factor for the ongoing price increase. Echoing Ali’s sentiment, another analyst from Crypto Daily Trade Signals identified a symmetrical triangle pattern in DOGE’s price movements, reinforcing the potential for continued upward momentum.

Ethereum prices are up double-digit percentage points (11% as of this writing) on renewed ETF optimism. Using the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust as a proxy, Bitcoin prices are currently trading at the high end of this year's range. As we first noted in today's Morning Lineup, while equities are having a snoozer of a session, crypto prices are rallying. Although it has come off the high, the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was above $70,000 this morning for the first time in over a month. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) prices are up double-digit percentage points (11% as of this writing) on renewed ETF optimism. As shown below, using the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) as a proxy, Bitcoin prices are currently trading at the high end of this year's range. Typically, it goes without being said that crypto prices are highly volatile given the asset is at one of the more extreme ends of the risk spectrum. In a similar boat are the most heavily shorted stocks. Those ""meme stocks"" were also recently in the spotlight as they saw a temporary resurgence last week. In the chart below, we show the relative strength line of GBTC versus an index of the 100 most heavily shorted Russell 3,000 members over the past year. For the most part, GBTC has outperformed the most heavily shorted stocks. However, beginning in mid-March, that relationship swapped to those highly shorted names beginning to outperform Bitcoin. That hit a pinnacle one week ago as stocks like GameStop ( GME ) began giving up the ghost, and since then that relative strength line is back to favoring GBTC. Although last week had reminiscences of the 2021 meme stock mania, one interesting difference was the relationship with crypto prices and those short squeeze names. Using the same groups as above, below we show the rolling 50-day correlation between GBTC and the most heavily shorted stocks. As shown, for most of the past several years, Bitcoin has tended to have a decent positive correlation with price action in the most heavily shorted stocks. In other words, crypto prices and heavily shorted stocks generally moved in the same direction on a given day. That positive correlation has been present recently, although it got a dent on the meme stock surge. Again, that hit to the correlation has been merely a dent as it stands in stark contrast to January 2021 (or even various other points of the past year) when the two had historically uncorrelated moves.
