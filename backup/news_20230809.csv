15843484,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546448,1691622039,"Toncoin (TON) Surges As Crypto Market Rebounds, Can Bulls Send The Price To $2?","The TON price currently hovers at $1.28, representing a 4.54% price increase in the last 24 hours. Its price gain in the last 7 days stands at 7.58%. Toncoin is likely benefiting from the positive outlook of the global crypto market, standing at $1.18 trillion, representing a 1.42% gain in the last 24 hours. But how far can the rally go? What Could Be Driving TON’s Price Gains? According to a Ton Developer Report, the ecosystem recorded a massive increase in developer involvement of up to 102% in 2023. This is a significant increase from its previous levels in 2016. In addition, the report noted several events within the ecosystem that could be spurring the present surge. They include the DoraHacks Hackathon, TON Wiki Challenge, and the TON Grants program. Related Reading: XRP Price: Breaking This Key Resistance Could Propel Crypto To $21 By 2025 – Analyst Also, the TON Developers Chats community grew by 6.5% in Q2 2023, with 9,134 members by the end of June. This indicates rising interest among developers in the Toncoin network. The DoraHacks Hackathon was a significant event for the ecosystem’s growth, as it boosted community engagement. The TON Wallet challenge also recorded 101 submissions from developers competing for a share in the $40,000 prize pool. Similarly, the TON Wiki Challenge received 50 valuable contributions and rewarded 30 participants with a total prize of $5,000 in USD. Furthermore, the TVM challenge recorded the presentation of 11 projects with new features. The participants competed for a share in the $54,000 prize pool. Finally, the Ton Web App Challenge presents concepts that cut across various ecosystems and their progress. Aside from challenges, the TON Grants program supported 34 projects with approximately $66,000 in funding. These projects will likely positively affect the ecosystem once they are complete. With these strategic programs, TON is transforming into a developers’ hub, and the increased activity on the network is driving its price gains. Can TON Reach $2? TON shows limited trading activity with the small candles formed on the daily chart. It is trading below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), expressing a bearish sentiment. Also, the 50-day SMA is about to drop below the 200-day SMA, forming a Death cross which confirms an increase in bearish pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a value of 31.42, close to the oversold region 30. However, the RSI is moving sideways, confirming price volatility for the asset. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is below the signal line, also expressing a bearish sentiment. However, the Histogram bars are fading, hinting at a short-term price surge.

42419775,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFnnJ,1691618446,The Protocol: Coinbase Launches Own Blockchain as Sleuths Scour PayPal's Stablecoin Software,"Today’s big news story in the blockchain tech world is the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase’s launch of its new Ethereum layer-2 network, Base – possibly the first of its kind to be launched by a publicly traded company. Is it the start of a new era? (Please see coverage in Protocol Village, below.)  Our feature by Sam Kessler takes a look at the past two weeks' debacle (and near disaster) involving the decentralized stablecoin exchange Curve – and adds up the lingering risks the industry still needs to address.  You're reading The Protocol, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that explores the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Subscribe here to get it every week.  Network news  PAYPAL STABLECOIN: PayPal, the peer-to-peer payments platform, unveiled its own stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), to be backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term Treasuries and cash equivalents. Built atop the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-20 token standard, PYUSD is the first stablecoin to be launched by a large traditional financial company. The actual issuer of the stablecoin is Paxos, whose original stablecoin Pax dollar (USDP) has failed to gain significant market share compared with leaders like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Paxos previously managed BUSD, the Binance-branded stablecoin, but stopped minting it in February at the direction of New York state regulators. Walter Hessert, head of strategy at Paxos Trust, told CoinDesk TV that holders of the new PayPal stablecoin might be have more protection since the company is regulated, and “customers’ assets are protected, including if Paxos were to go bankrupt.” X (formerly Twitter) filled up with snarky posts from blockchain sleuths analyzing the Ethereum smart-contract coding for the stablecoin. One narrative focused on an “assetProtection” role that appears to allow a centralized actor to wipe balances; another thread homed in on the project’s use of a five-year-old version of Solidity, a programming language used for Ethereum smart contracts. Scammers immediately started trying to defraud unsuspecting users by issuing fake tokens with the same trading ticker as PayPal’s. There’s some speculation that PayPal’s entrée might put pressure on U.S. lawmakers to push forward on stablecoin legislation. Our columnist David Z. Morris notes that the real prize for PayPal might be interest revenue from reinvesting customer deposits.  EXCHANGE JITTERS? Huobi, the crypto exchange advised by Tron’s Justin Sun, saw its stablecoin reserves decline by $49 million in a week, or about 33%, as financial media in Hong Kong reported that several executives had been taken away by police in China. (A Huobi spokesperson denied the reports.) Then on Tuesday, blockchain data showed that a large investor (a “whale” in crypto slang) made two large deposits into Huobi worth more than $200 million, boosting the exchange’s holdings of USDT and Ether. A Huobi spokesperson said that the address does not belong to Justin Sun. The address is tagged as one of the top-10 holders of TRX token.  OPEN-SOURCE, OPEN WOUND. Matter Labs, developer behind the Ethereum layer-2 network zkSync, was accused by rival Polygon of copying part of its open-source code without providing proper attribution. Matter Labs quickly acknowledged that some code was copied, but insisted that the attribution had been provided. Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski later conceded that its attributions could have been more prominent, writing on X (formerly Twitter) that “there is a more standard approach to attributions, which we will wholeheartedly apply from now on."" The kerfuffle provided a lesson on the community norms around usage of open-source software – and an example of just how touchy things can get in an ultra-competitive environment.  Worldcoin, the “proof-of-personhood” identity project with its iris-scanning orb, had its Nairobi warehouse raided by Kenyan police, local news organizations reported.  LinksDAO, an online community that bought a golf course in Scotland earlier this year for roughly $1 million, is accepting new members.  David Rubenstein, billionaire private-equity titan, says bitcoin is here to stay, notes that there’s demand for a form of money that can’t be controlled by governments, regrets not buying BTC at $100.  Protocol Village  Base, new Ethereum layer 2 blockchain built on OP Stack by the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, went live on Wednesday. (Click here for our exclusive interview with Jesse Pollak, head of protocols at Coinbase, who oversaw the rollout of the rollup.)  Community members of Mantle Network, a layer 2 network, approvesd creation of an economics committee to manage its $4.2 billion treasury.  Circle Internet Financial, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, releasesd a new, programmable web3 wallet platform that the company says can help businesses offer digital asset payments to customers.  Safe, institutional grade multisig smart wallet, integrates with Moonpay for fiat on-ramps.  Alchemy Pay, specialist in making fiat payments available to cryptocurrency and Web3 services, incorporates USDD stablecoin into its Ramp platform.  Money Center  Fundraisings  Hi, crypto payments application with Ethereum sidechain, raises $30M in strategic investment, forges partnership with metaverse gaming and venture capital giant Animoca Brands. (Animoca)  Solv Protocol, Singapore-based on-chain fund protocol, raises $6M, to expand team and continue development of technology designed to help organizations raise money through creation, usage and sale of financial products. (Laser Digital (part of Nomura Securities), UOB Venture Management, Mirana Ventures, Emirates Consortium, Matrix Partners, Apollo Capital, HashCIB, Geek Cartel and Bytetrade Labs.)  Deals and grants  Arbitrum community votes on two governance proposals covering $5M of ARB tokens from project’s nearly $4B treasury, for grant programs to fund development in the layer-2 blockchain’s ecosystem.  Avalanche Foundation pledged to buy $50M of tokenized assets minted on the network, adding fuel to one of crypto’s hottest trends this year.  Yuga Labs, creator behind Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, agreed to acquire Los Angeles-based Roar Studios in an effort to expand its Otherside metaverse.  Data and tokens  Paradigm Capital, Andreesen Horowitz, early backers of the decentralized stablecoin protocol MakerDAO, have transferred more than $10M of the project’s MKR tokens to new blockchain addresses, raising speculation that the investors might cash out following a price rally of 73% in just one month.  Parrot Finance, Solana-based DeFi protocol targeted by activist investors, will buy back its PRT tokens, after community vote to return slice of treasury valued north of $70M.  Kin (KIN) price surges after community vote to burn trillions of the tokens, a week after Ted Livingston, former CEO of messaging app Kik, had introduced Code, which is built around KIN.  DeFi Stuck in Crypto Winter, Based on Key Metric: Messari  Decentralized finance or DeFi ecosystems are still suffering through crypto winter, according to the analysis firm Messari. As a whole, the industry’s total value locked, or TVL – a key metric that represents collateral and deposits put into blockchain protocols – has been declining. On Ethereum, by far the biggest DeFi ecosystem, TVL dropped by 13% drop to $23 billion over the past 30 days. Optimism and Solana eked out gains.

15841669,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546444,1691618429,Cardano False Breakdown: Could It Set The Stage For A 26% Climb?,"The recent drop in the price of Cardano (ADA) has raised concerns among investors as it breached the combined support of $0.3 and a crucial support trendline. However, a closer analysis of the daily chart reveals a twist that might offer a glimmer of hope for the cryptocurrency’s recovery. Technical analysis of Cardano’s price movement suggests that the apparent breakdown from the rising support trendline might be a fake one. Related Reading: Can Litecoin Bulls Turn The Tide On Recent Declines? A Closer Look A fake breakdown, also known as a false breakdown or a bear trap, occurs when a price temporarily drops below a support level or trendline but quickly rebounds, trapping bearish traders who sold during the dip. This deceptive move often leads to a rapid reversal and upward momentum. Cardano: Fake Breakdown Or True Bearish Signal? On the flip side, a decisive breakout from the overhead trendline could set the stage for a substantial 26% upswing in Cardano’s price, as per recent price analysis. This would not only mark a significant price recovery but also instill renewed optimism among traders and investors. Providing insights into the current market dynamics, it’s important to acknowledge the broader context surrounding Cardano’s performance. Despite the recent price turmoil, Cardano has demonstrated remarkable growth in terms of its total value locked (TVL). Crypto analytics firm Messari’s latest report reveals that Cardano’s TVL has surged by nearly 200% since the start of the year. Related Reading: XRP Price: Breaking This Key Resistance Could Propel Crypto To $21 By 2025 – Analyst Quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), the TVL increased by 9.7%, and year-to-date (YTD), it soared by an impressive 198.6%. This surge in TVL propelled Cardano from the 34th to the 21st position in terms of overall TVL among all blockchain networks. This remarkable feat underscores the growing adoption and utility of Cardano’s ecosystem. Setback Due To Regulatory Pressure However, the journey to this achievement has not been without its challenges. The report points out that Cardano’s TVL experienced a dip in June, triggered by regulatory turbulence. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities, with ADA being specifically mentioned in the lawsuit. This development led to a sell-off of ADA and resulted in liquidations on Cardano-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. ADA market cap currently at $10.4 billion in today's chart: TradingView.com As of the latest data from CoinGecko, Cardano is currently trading at $0.299138. While the cryptocurrency has seen a 3.1% rally in the past 24 hours, it has also endured a 3.8% slump over the last seven days. Cardano’s recent price movement may appear bearish due to a seemingly significant breakdown from key supports. However, a careful analysis suggests the possibility of a fake breakdown, providing some ounce of optimism for a potential recovery. Amidst challenges, Cardano’s impressive TVL growth reflects its resilience and adoption within the crypto ecosystem. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

42419761,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFnav,1691616781,SEC Will Appeal XRP Ruling in Case Against Ripple,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will file an ""interlocutory appeal"" of a judge's ruling on Ripple's programmatic sales of XRP, the regulator said in a court filing on Wednesday.  The SEC said it was seeking ""leave to"" appeal part of a recent decision while other parts of the SEC's case proceed to trial. The regulator said approval of an interlocutory appeal could prevent the SEC and government from needing two trials.  ""Specifically, the SEC seeks to certify the court’s holding that defendants’ 'programmatic' offers and sales to XRP buyers over crypto asset trading platforms and Ripple’s 'other distributions' in exchange for labor and services did not involve the offer or sale of securities under [the Howey test],"" the SEC filing said.  A federal judge ruled last month that while Ripple's direct sales of XRP to institutional investors violated securities law, its programmatic sales to retail investors through exchanges did not. The SEC had sued Ripple in 2020, alleging that the firm was selling unregistered securities in XRP.  Judge Analisa Torres, of the U.S. Southern District Court, had tentatively scheduled a trial on other issues that she didn't rule on during the motions for judgement for the second quarter of 2024.  In its filing, the SEC noted that Ripple will have to respond by Aug. 16 (a week from the letter's filing), and proposed filing an opening brief laying out the appeal on Aug. 18. Ripple would have two weeks to respond, and the SEC would have another week to reply to Ripple if the judge signs off on the filing.  The SEC had previously hinted that it might appeal the ruling in a separate case, when attorneys for the regulator urged U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff of the same court to ignore the ruling as he mulled over Terraform Labs' motion to dismiss its own SEC lawsuit. Rakoff later denied the motion to dismiss, rejecting Torres' ruling on programmatic sales in the process.

The miner reported an adjusted earnings per share loss of $0.17, beating FactSet consensus analyst estimates for a loss of $0.20 per share, but revenue came in $76.7 million, short of analyst estimates of $84.6 million.  Quarterly revenue consisted of $49.7 million from bitcoin mining, $7.7 million from data center hosting and $19.3 million from engineering. The quarterly revenue compared to $72.9 million in the year-ago period, with the rise driven by a 27% increase in bitcoin production, offset by lower bitcoin prices.  Shares of Riot were falling 1.4% to $16.12 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Riot shares are up more than 383% this year, having benefited from the strong performance of bitcoin.  “Riot’s core business is Bitcoin mining, and the scale of our vertically integrated operations and financial strength allowed us to execute on our power strategy at unmatched scale this quarter, driving our average cost to mine to $8,389 per Bitcoin in the second quarter, compared to an average Bitcoin price of $28,024,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot, in a statement.  The company noted in its filing that it expects to benefit from growing consolidation in the bitcoin mining industry this year.  “We anticipate companies in our industry will continue to experience challenges, and that 2023 will continue to be a period of consolidation in the Bitcoin mining industry, and, given our relative position, liquidity and absence of long-term debt, we believe we are positioned in the competitive landscape to benefit from such consolidation,” the company wrote.  Riot said it expects to reach total self-mining hash rate capacity of 12.5 EH/S in the fourth quarter, whereas previously it anticipated this happening sometime in the second half of 2023. The company reiterated guidance given in its July update that its total self-mining hash rate capacity is expected to reach 20.1 EH/s by mid-2024.

42419771,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFnjB,1691615700,Fireblocks Discloses ‘Zero Day’ Vulnerabilities Impacting Leading MPC Wallets,"Fireblocks, an enterprise-focused crypto infrastructure firm, has disclosed a set of vulnerabilities – collectively referred to as “BitForge” – impacting a variety of popular crypto wallets that use multi-party computation (MPC) technology.  The firm has classified BitForge as a “zero-day” – meaning the vulnerabilities hadn’t been discovered by developers of the affected software prior to disclosure from Fireblocks.  Coinbase, ZenGo, and Binance – three of the biggest companies impacted by BitForge – have already worked with Fireblocks to remediate their exposure to potential exploits, according to the firm. Fireblocks says it has worked to identify other teams that might be impacted and has reached out to them in accordance with the “industry-standard 90-day responsible disclosure process.”  Even though the particular vulnerabilities may have been patched in major wallets, the episode raises potentially alarming questions about just how safe these supposedly ultra-safe MPC wallets really are.  “If left unremediated, the exposures would allow attackers and malicious insiders to drain funds from the wallets of millions of retail and institutional customers in seconds, with no knowledge to the user or vendor,” Fireblocks said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.  While Fireblocks says that attacks exploiting the vulnerabilities would have been “practical,” the firm believes their complexity made them difficult to discover in advance of Wednesday’s disclosure. “The chances that someone – some malicious actor from, let's say, North Korea figured it out months before we figured it out and disclosed it to wallet providers – I would say that the likelihood of that is very, very, very low,” Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov told CoinDesk.  If MPC wallet users want to know whether they might be using a vulnerable wallet, Shaulov said they can reach out to Fireblocks or fill out a form that will be posted to its website.  Multi-party computation  In the context of crypto wallets, “MPC technology was primarily designed to make sure that that you don't have a single point of failure – a private key is not sitting on a single server or on a single device,” explained Shaurov.  Wallets that use MPC encrypt a user’s private key and split it across several different parties – typically some combination of a wallet user, a wallet provider, and a trusted third party. In theory, no single one of these entities can unlock the wallet without help from the others.  According to Fireblocks, the BitForge vulnerabilities would have “allowed a hacker to extract the full private key if they were able to compromise only one device,” undermining the whole “multi-party” aspect of MPC.  How it worked  Fireblocks outlined technical details of the BitForge vulnerabilities in a set of technical reports released on Wednesday.  Generally, for an attacker to take advantage of the BitForge vulnerabilities, they would need to compromise the device of a wallet user or break into the internal systems of someone else with a piece of the user’s encrypted private key – either the wallet service or one of those third-party custodians.  The steps from there would depend on the wallet. The BitForge vulnerabilities were present in several popular research papers that describe how to build MPC systems, and different wallet providers will have implemented this research differently.  Coinbase says its main user-facing wallet service, Coinbase Wallet, was not impacted by the bugs, whereas Coinbase Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) – which companies can use to power their own MPC wallets – was technically vulnerable before Coinbase implemented a fix.  According to Coinbase, the Fireblocks-discovered vulnerabilities would have been “nearly impossible to exploit” in its case – requiring a “malicious server inside Coinbase infrastructure” to trick users into “initiating hundreds of fully authenticated signing requests.”  “It is extremely unlikely that any customer would be willing to go through that tedious and manual process hundreds of times before contacting us for support,” Coinbase said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/09/fireblocks-discloses-zero-day-vulnerabilities-impacting-leading-mpc-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b035bcebbf5348a357c34d15ba57387738402ebc-3353x2514.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15839935,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546446,1691614836,MakerDAO Debates New EDSR Optimization Plan As MKR Bears Retain Market Control,"MakerDAO has been in the headlines recently following a boost in the maximum Dai Savings Rate (DSR) from 3.19% to 8% on Sunday, August 6. This temporary increment termed the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate (EDSR), was designed to encourage more Dai (Maker’s stablecoin) holders to deposit their tokens on the Maker protocol and earn interest. Following the implementation of EDSR, the Dai token has experienced some traction, with its market cap rising by over $570 million since Sunday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. In addition, data from the Makerburn dashboard shows the number of DAI in the DSR program has surged, moving 396.8 million on August 6 to its current value of 906.7 million. However, amidst the massive success of the EDSR, MakerDAO co-founder Christen Rune has proposed to adjust this incentive plan “based on observed data.” MakerDAO Co-Founder Proposes EDSR Optimization Plan To Curb ETH Whale Dominance On August 8, Rune submitted a governance proposal on the MakerDAO forum to optimize the Enhanced Dai Savings Rate citing an ongoing ETH whale dominance over regular Dai holders in terms of the program’s benefits. Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Signals Bullish Price Formation – Is $1.300 Around The Corner? According to Rune, offering yields on Dai that are higher than the cost of borrowing Dai has led to certain borrowing activity known as “borrow arbitrage,” whereby traders borrow Dai at 3.19% and deposit in the EDSR program for 8% profit. Rune noted that this was not the intended purpose of the EDSR plan. He stated that this investment strategy was mainly practiced by ETH and staked ETH whales, who now receive a higher yield at the expense of regular Dai holders, the primary target of the EDSR program. To counter this unforeseen circumstance, Christen Rune proposed to reduce the maximum EDSR interest rate from 8% to 5%. Furthermore, the MakerDAO cofounder proposes an increment in the DAI borrowing rate to be equivalent to the EDSR rate at a minimum of 5%, thus halting the ongoing large-scale “borrow arbitrage” activities. The proposal also states that MakerDAO should extend Tier 1 EDSR to cover a utilization range of 0-40% and introduce a Tier 2 EDSR for utilization between 40-55% with the aim of making the EDSR plan sustainable. For context, utilization refers to the portion of the total capacity of the EDSR system that is in use. Currently, data from Makerburn states that the EDSR has an 18% utilization rate. Originally, the EDSR maximum yield was meant to drop to 5.8% once utilization surged to 20%, albeit that would not occur upon approval of Rune’s latest proposal. Maker (MKR) Maintains Bearish Form Amidst ESDR Success In other news, MKR, the native token of the MakerDAO lending protocol, has seen its market price fall in recent days despite the massive boost in DAI’s market shares. According to data from CoinMarketCap, MKR’s price is down by 0.84% in the last 24 hours. This price drop adds to the token’s prolonged bearish state, whereby it has lost over 8.26% of its market value in the last seven days. Related Reading: Record-Breaking $10 Billion Open Interest Fuels Bullish Speculation For Bitcoin Reversal During this period, MKR’s price declined from $1,339.22 on Aug.3 to as low as $1,187.66 on Aug.7.

At the time of writing, MKR is trading at $1,214.28, with a 0.39% loss in the last hour. With a market cap of $1.18 billion, the token is ranked as the 42nd largest cryptocurrency in the market.

Regulatory scrutiny and Bitcoin price volatility remain challenges for Marathon Digital's future profitability. The company's commitment to enhancing hash rate and mining capacity, along with proprietary firmware development, demonstrates a strategy for operational efficiency. Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) released its Q2 earnings report on August 8. Despite Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) 78% price gain YTD, the mining company didn't show profitability in its Q2 earnings. Marathon reported a 228.5% YoY increase in revenue, and a Q2 net loss of $21.3 million, resulting in a per-share loss of $0.13. Net loss increased by 195.83% over Q1's net loss of $7.2 million. This financial performance mirrors the complex interplay between the cost of Bitcoin production, the market price of Bitcoin, and other operating expenses such as energy costs. Marathon's revenue has seen a rebound this year, following a very bleak 2022 plagued with implosions and bank runs that affected the crypto space. Marathon Digital reported $81.8 million in Q2 revenue, below consensus expectations. The increase in revenue is attributable to an increase in the number of Bitcoin mined per day in Q2. Despite the missed consensus estimates, Marathon's financial performance demonstrated significant growth compared to the previous year. Bitcoin production was 314% higher YoY at an average of 32 Bitcoin per day, but the average Bitcoin price was 14% lower, impacting revenues. Hosting and energy costs increased to $55.2 million due to higher Bitcoin production. Marathon's liquidity position seems strong with cash and cash equivalents of $128 million and approximately 12,538 Bitcoin with a carrying value of $234.4 million and a fair value of $382 million at the end of Q1. A Look at Q2 Revamped Hashrate and Mining Marathon Digital (Source: Marathon Digital) Marathon's operational hash rate increased by 54% in Q2 compared to Q1, and a record 2429% YoY, reaching 17.7 EH/s. The operational hash rate continued to climb after Q2, hitting approximately 19 EH/s in July. Marathon has doubled its operational hash rate since the start of FY2023, positioning itself as the top mining company in the Bitcoin mining space. The total Bitcoin mined in Q2 increased by 33% from Q1. Marathon reported 2,926 mined Bitcoins in Q2, which is 731 Bitcoins more than the total Bitcoins mined in Q1. This increase in mining was supported by the company's expanding hash rate and improved uptime made possible by the introduction of an unnamed ""dashboard"" software that helps monitor and control output, uptime, and hash rate. Bitcoin NFTs and their Effect On Mining Coin Metrics The November 2021 Taproot upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol has resulted in the ability to do more on the Bitcoin network, besides peer-to-peer crypto transfers. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have been introduced to the Bitcoin network through the Ordinals protocol. Token creation capabilities were only available on smart contract networks like Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ) before the Ordinals protocol. Bitcoin tokens, known as BRC-20 tokens, reached a total market cap of $1 billion in May, bringing a new wave of activity to the Bitcoin blockchain. Creating a BRC-20 token incurs fees paid to miners. In Q2, about 7.6% ($184 million) of total miners' earnings ($2.4 billion) came from fees. BRC-20 tokens largely influenced a surge in earnings from fees for Bitcoin miners. Several reports confirm this. Outlook and Forward Guidance Predicting the future path to profitability for mining companies could prove to be more difficult than for companies in other sectors. Regulatory headwinds abound in the blockchain space, and mining companies are not immune from regular scrutiny. Marathon Digital has experienced its fair share of the SEC's scrutiny, even being served with an SEC subpoena in Q2. Also, with Bitcoin being its main source of revenue, volatility in the price of Bitcoin severely influences Marathon Digital's earnings and cash flow. In the Q2 earnings call, Marathon Digital's team reiterated its commitment to increasing the company's hash rate and mining capacity to reach 23 EH/s by year-end. Some of the technological and energy efficiency improvements highlighted in the call include the development of its proprietary firmware for mining equipment, which demonstrated better security and overall efficiency when benchmarked against other industry alternatives, according to Marathon's management. I think investment in proprietary firmware gives Marathon an edge to fine-tune its miners to outperform competitors. Marathon's Q3 and Q4 profitability prospects largely depend on the price action of Bitcoin and the direction the crypto market goes. Bitcoin entered and has been in a consolidation phase since early July. I wrote an analysis that pointed to Bitcoin likely entering a consolidation phase in early July. For about four weeks the price of BTC has ranged between $28,000 support and a new resistance at $30,500. I see Bitcoin continuing its movement in a tight range, but a breakout is imminent as halving nears and a pre-halving rally begins. I'd also like to point out that a pre-halving rally is likely but not guaranteed, as Bitcoin market cycles differ and previous rallies do not guarantee a recurrence. Stock Price Crypto mining stocks have seen impressive returns YTD. Marathon's stock has increased 368% YTD, bouncing significantly from last December's dip. The stocks of Hive Digital ( HIVE ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) have had a similar movement as Marathon's stock. These three stocks have outperformed Bitcoin YTD. Seeking Alpha The huge YTD price increase makes mining stocks risky to hold at the moment. The next Bitcoin halving is estimated to take place in April 2024. With halving just a few months away, there is a risk of reduced revenue as the Bitcoin block reward gets cut in half. The Bitcoin halving can also lead to an increase in mining difficulty, prompting mining companies to procure more powerful hardware to be able to effectively compete for block rewards. The more powerful hardware in turn results in higher energy costs. Procurement of more powerful hardware and the resulting energy costs create more operational expenses at a time of reduced revenue and is always a major challenge for miners. Conclusion Marathon Digital's improved operational efficiency in Q2 scores great points for the company. However, the upcoming Bitcoin halving and potential volatility make the challenge of maintaining profitability persistent. Mining stocks' impressive YTD gains are accompanied by risks tied to the approaching halving and its impact on revenue and operational cost. Staying away from mining stocks at this time can be considered a safe bet.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4626160-takeaways-from-marathon-digital-q2-earnings-call?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15838565.jpeg

This is in response to the recent questions faced by the protocol on its slippage feature. Slippage refers to the price difference between when a transaction order is submitted and when the transaction is executed by the market maker and confirmed on the blockchain. MuesliSwap Acknowledges Lack Of “Adequate Clarity” In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the team behind MuesliSwap admitted that it failed to provide “adequate clarity” on the slippage feature within its decentralized exchange. Users have had to pay high slippage due to the manner in which the protocol’s matchmaker was designed. Related Reading: Is Curve DAO (CRV) Price On Track To Reach Or Exceed $1 This Month? The MuesliSwap team explained in the post: Our decentralized matchmaker setup allowed each matchmaker to fill the limit order and choose whether to return the additional slippage amount or retain the difference at their discretion. MuesliSwap claims this difference has served as an incentive for the matchmakers since the beginning. To further clarify, the protocol’s team said this “supplementary matchmaker incentive” pushes the decentralized matchmaker to prioritize users’ orders during periods of high market volatility. However, it acknowledged that pushing this under the unclear term “slippage” may have confused new users. 📣 Clarifying Slippage on MuesliSwap: We want to address confusion about advanced matchmaker slippage on our platform.

The team claims that the funds for users’ reimbursement will come from the “project funds”. Additionally, MuesliSwap said that a comprehensive analysis of all trades will be carried out to ensure fair refunds. “This process may take approximately 3 to 4 weeks as we gather and validate the necessary data, and implement the distribution code,” the team noted. MuesliSwap To Remedy The Situation? At the end of the post, MuesliSwap stated that swift action has been taken to fix the high slippage issue in the DEX order book.

But crypto whales have already spent days trading high-risk tokens on the new layer 2 network as well as other blockchains.  Beyond their holdings of market-leader ETH, 22 high-rolling depositors to Base have large positions in Arbitrum’s governance token ARB, casino token RLB and memecoins BALD, TOSHI, PEPE and HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu which has the ticker, BITCOIN, not the famous crypto but rather another meme coin, according to a report by Nansen.  UNIBOT, the Telegram trading bot token, is also among the top tokens held by these whales.  Nansen said these 22 whales display crypto-native tendencies and have each bridged over 100 ETH (worth $185,100) since July 31, when Base was accessible to users willing to interact directly with its smart contract through a one-way bridge. More casual users waited until today, when Base’s frontend went live alongside an exit ramp that allows them to bridge out of the ecosystem, and back to Ethereum.  One wallet was made in 2017, while half of the early Base whales were fresh wallets created this year. Early Base whales have also been active in competing Ethereum scaling solutions Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync Era and Polygon zkEVM.  “There is a heavy memecoin bias in the selection of these whales,” said Nansen analyst Niklas Polk. “There was not much else to do on Base except aping meme coins, hence most of the whales in the report have some affinity to this.”  The 22 early base whales, which had the most interactions with 1inch, Uniswap, Base, 0x, USDC and Unibot, “show how heavily leaning towards Ethereum and L2 ecosystems,” wrote Nansen research analyst Jake Kennis. “Their interactions with well-established DEXs, L2 bridges, and especially the noticeable presence of Unibot, shows the adoption of Telegram bots and new applications.”  “With more apps coming online (DEXs/lending), will likely see a more mature ecosystem not solely revolved around memecoins,” Kennis said to CoinDesk in a telegram message.",NEUTRAL,ETH | ARB,ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | ZRX | ARB,Sage D.

The episode, which aired on Hulu on August 7, tells the story of a professor that informs his crew that he had borrowed money from the Robot Mafia, an organized crime syndicate, to invest in bitcoin (BTC), which later crashed and led the crew to go bankrupt. In the episode - set in 3023 - people are still mining bitcoin, which remains volatile even in the future.  It is argued to be inspired by the Western classic “How the West Was Won” which spends parts of it narrating how pioneers moved to the West to discover gold during the “Gold Rush” era. The number 101001, which in decimal is 81, was supposedly chosen as a reference to the 2018 bitcoin crash in which the cryptocurrency dropped as much as 81%.  As the story goes on, the crew tries to find new ways to make money, for example, by mining thallium, a toxic metal used to mine crypto, and selling it to the miners.  The show also jokes about the concerns frequently raised about the immense use of electricity for mining bitcoin. It features a “crypto country” called “Doge City,” named after the popular meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE).  “It’s pretty lawless out here in crypto country, so put on your protective headgear,” one of the characters said as they entered Doge City, possibly alluding to the fact that it appears to be an old-fashioned Western town due to the fact that the bitcoin mining computers use up all the electricity in the city or perhaps a jab at lack of oversight in the crypto sector that led to multiple hacks and bankruptcies in recent years.

Co-founder of private investment firm The Carlyle Group David Rubenstein joins this long list of individuals as he wishes he had bought BTC early on. Bitcoin Is Here To Stay Speaking on Bloomberg Television on August 8, Rubenstein said he wished he had bought Bitcoin when one BTC was worth $100. The statement stems from the fact that the billionaire believes BTC is here to stay, following “enormous interest” in the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: ARK Invest’s CEO Says SEC Could Approve Multiple Spot Bitcoin ETFs Simultaneously He explained that Bitcoin’s decentralization is key to this interest as people want a form of money that governments can’t control. According to him: There’s enormous interest around the world, and to be able to have something you can transfer without having the government knowing about it, and keep it private. You can say people shouldn’t do that, but that’s not going to stop people from doing it. BTC price rocks up to $29,873 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BlackRock Is Key To All Of It Rubenstein also noted that people who once mocked BTC and other cryptocurrencies might begin to have second thoughts following BlackRock’s application for a Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). “What’s happened is people made fun of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but now the establishment, Larry Fink at BlackRock, is now saying they’re going to have an ETF if approved by the government in bitcoin,” Rubenstein told Bloomberg. “So you’re saying wait a second, the mighty BlackRock is willing to have an ETF in bitcoin, maybe bitcoin is going to be around for a while.” The billionaire investor’s sentiments echo that of Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, who mentioned, during an interview on Bloomberg TV with David Rubenstein, that BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink’s change of heart was the “most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin.” “He [Larry Fink] got ‘orange-pilled. Larry was a nonbeliever. Now he says, ‘Hey, this is going to be a global currency.’ People around the world all trust it,” he said. Larry, who had once referred to BTC as “an index of money laundering,” said in a July 5 interview with Fox Business that Bitcoin could revolutionize the financial industry as it could be used as a hedge against inflation instead of traditional gold. Related Reading: Can PayPal’s PYUSD Be Frozen In Your Wallet Like Tether’s USDT? There is no denying the influence that BlackRock and its CEO Larry Fink could have on BTC adoption, especially among institutional investors. BlackRock is currently the largest asset manager with over $9.1 trillion in assets under management (AuM). With such a large clientele base, the market could see more individual investors, companies, governments, and foundations invest in Bitcoin through BlackRock (when their spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved by the SEC). Meanwhile, Larry Fink is a prominent figure on Wall Street and one who boasts tremendous influence in the financial world, and he will likely carry this influence into crypto.

Instead, the altcoin’s price has continued to stall even during periods of market recovery. However, this trend could change pretty soon given the current accumulation trend among sharks and whales, something that could take a significant chunk of available supply off the open market and trigger another rally. Cardano Sharks And Whales Go To Market In a Tuesday post, the on-chain data aggregator platform Santiment revealed an interesting development concerning the ADA sharks and whales. The sharks and whales in this instance refer to wallets holding at least 100,000 ADA and at most 10 million ADA. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Could Reach $180,000 Next Cycle If This Happens What Santiment has found is that this 100,000-10 million cohort has been consistently adding to their balances. The accumulation first began a little over two months ago on May 21, and since then, they have collectively bought over $116.1 million worth of ADA. Sharks and whales accumulate $116.1 million worth of ADA | Source: Santiment on X This buying spree also saw their trading volume rise significantly during this time as well. As the on-chain tracker revealed, the sharks and whales saw their cumulative volume cross 67 billion ADA toward the end of July. As a result of their consistent buying, sharks and whales now account for 34.4% of the total circulating ADA supply. The last time that their holdings were this high was back in 2022, before the FTX collapse. Additionally, their cumulative trading volume is now sitting at its highest level since September 2021. Will ADA Respond Positively? In the last two months in which the Cardano sharks and whales have been active, ADA has seen some encouraging price action. In July, its price jumped from below $0.3 to a local high of $0.37. But ultimately, the altcoin corrected back downward, losing a little over 20% of its value. Since then, the digital asset has continuously struggled to maintain $0.29, with bears having more good days compared to bulls. However, there could be a change in the horizon given that investor sentiment seems to have skewed in favor of buying instead of selling.

So it may not be long before ADA is retesting the $0.35 resistance again. And if this rally happens to coincide with a recovery in the price of Bitcoin (BTC), then it could beat its recent local peak of $0.37 and rally above $0.4. For this to happen, though, the bulls would have to maintain control and the 6% jump in the altcoin’s daily trading volume in the last day could be evidence of this. At the time of writing, ADA is trailing at $0.2991, up 2.93% on the daily chart. However, the asset is seeing 2.33% losses on the weekly chart.

42419774,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFnmH,1691603421,Barbie Is a Metaverse,"A Barbie doll is like a virtual reality (VR) headset. Both are made of plastic. Both are mass-produced retail products. And both have had the absolute crap marketed out of them in the name of consumerism. But also, both are gateways through which humans have found the capacity to transcend the limitations of our physical existence and explore manufactured worlds in pursuit of greater meaning and fulfillment in our lives.  Visitors to these worlds could be anyone or anything they wanted — no matter who they were or weren’t back in the so-called real world. And while VR has transported its users to places where they can be adventurers, warriors and heroes, Barbie seeded a world where women graduated from college, held independent careers, and earned income of their own. In 1959, when Barbie was invented, this was still a wild idea. Back then, women did little else with their lives than bear children, tend to household chores, and cater to their husbands.  Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, is the director of Emfarsis, a consulting firm focused on the role of technology in advancing economic development in Asia.  Metaverses are about more than technology, just like Barbie is more than a piece of plastic. I realized this after reading a fabulous book called Virtual Society by Herman Narula. Narula, who co-founded Improbable, a metaverse technology company, argues that the metaverse has little to do with the devices or rails that we use to represent and reach it. He says it is defined by the experiences and social interactions that we have within it, the meaning that we derive from those experiences, and how the value created by those experiences is exchanged with other interconnected worlds.  Pointing to ancient monuments such as the Göbekli Tepe and Egyptian pyramids, which seem to have been erected by humans apparently for no other reason than to symbolize our coexistence between physical reality and other worlds, Narula says we have been traversing metaverses for many thousands of years already using “tools no more advanced than our language and our imagination.”  Removing digitalness from the definition really helped me grasp the true meaning of the metaverse and why it should matter to us at all. In blockchain, and the tech world more broadly, we have a tendency to pedestalize the technology as though it’s a use case in and of itself. But this is missing the point.  Read more: Aubrey Strobel - Bitcoin Is 'Big Barbie' Energy  According to Narula, “virtual worlds are spoken into existence and sustained by the strength of our collective belief in them. As people come to believe in these other worlds, their faith expands the worlds’ parameters, and these realms can, effectively, come to life.” In other words, a metaverse is about more than a blockchain or whatever network it’s built on; it gains meaning from our communal interactions with it and its propensity to share value with the other worlds we inhabit, including (but not limited to) our everyday meatspace lives.  As such, Barbie fits the criteria for Narula’s metaverse. As a concept that spans multiple realities and many interconnected worlds — who else do you know that can simultaneously exist as an astronaut, a popstar, and President of the United States, all while pregnant?! — Barbie is a medium for reimagining who we are and could be. And through the collective strength of little girls’ imaginations worldwide, Barbie has merged with reality to become tangible over time.  Her world of make-believe relies on the faith of its participants to breathe life into the social construct  Key to Narula’s definition is the notion of “value transfer.” Other worlds are useless if they do not interact with our own and interoperability is the feature that allows us to determine if something is actually a metaverse and not just a single virtual world or a standalone platform. If you watch Barbie over the decades, you see that a constant exchange of value has precipitated tangible progress in the real world, and in turn, expanded the limits of collective imagination in the virtual world.  Shortly after she was launched in 1961, Barbie was a flight attendant. By 1990, she was flying the damn plane. This progression to the cockpit demonstrates how Barbie’s imaginary world adapted to the changing times as women's societal roles evolved and their ambitions grew bigger and bolder. This continues today. When the world called for more women in STEM, Barbie became an entrepreneur, a computer engineer and a game developer.  The realness of Barbie’s metaverse, however, has waned with the rise of an increasingly woke postmodern society zeroing in on the more surreal elements of her being — such as her unrealistic body image, culturally insensitive tropes, and perpetuation of gender stereotypes.  Like, in 2014, when the aforementioned Entrepreneur Barbie starred in a children’s book about developing a video game where she had to rely on the boys to do the programming for her. It’s no wonder this mom was left questioning the meaning of Barbie’s bimbo bubble and the value it delivered to her two year old daughter growing up in a real-world that has changed dramatically since the 50’s.  Just as Santa’s sleigh might drop out of the sky if the Christmas Spirit runs too low, or how bank runs happen when people lose faith in the financial system, Barbie relies on her believers to will her into existence. Narula explores this phenomena in his book too, highlighting how people have become less preoccupied with the afterlife since global living standards improved — you no longer have to hold out for heaven to have the perfect life. You can buy it at Macy’s today.  But Barbie’s fluctuating influence only underscores how she is, indeed, a metaverse. Her world of make-believe relies on the faith of its participants to breathe life into the social construct. As long as we believe that her world has meaning, then it is real, and there can be mutual exchange of value between the spheres. My guess is that the incredible success of the recent movie has rescued Barbie from fading into cultural oblivion, as millions around the world are now buying back into the myth. A Barbie is much cheaper than an Apple Vision Pro anyway.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Leah Callon-Butler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/09/barbie-is-a-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/995778779b6c303a15e1d9327edb1e7c90b17a90-2477x1209.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Aptos Labs, a leading blockchain developer, and Microsoft, a key backer of A.I. advancements through OpenAI, are joining forces to create the innovative Aptos Assistant, a ChatGPT-powered chatbot designed to provide users and developers with comprehensive information and analysis of the Aptos ecosystem. Aptos Labs And Microsoft Forge Alliances For Blockchain Development According to a report by Yahoo Finance, unlike previous endeavors in the crypto-related A.I. space, which primarily revolved around licensing OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Aptos Labs’ collaboration with Microsoft ventures beyond boundaries. The partnership encompasses various facets, with Aptos Labs hosting validator nodes on Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform, integrating its programming language, Move, into Microsoft’s popular coding platform, GitHub Copilot, and exploring opportunities to connect with major financial institutions seeking to build blockchain-powered applications on Azure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Longs Could Precipitate Plunge To $28,000, This Chart Urges Caution Rashmi Misra, General Manager of A.I. and Emerging Technologies at Microsoft, expressed excitement about the fusion of A.I. and blockchain, stating: The intersection of A.I. and blockchain is among the most interesting combinations of emerging technologies. By fusing Aptos Labs’ technology with the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service capabilities, we aim to democratize the use of blockchain. Aptos Labs has already secured substantial funding of $400 million from investors, according to Crunchbase, highlighting the confidence in their technological prowess. The collaboration with Microsoft further solidifies its position as a formidable player in the blockchain space. While A.I. startups have dominated funding in 2023, raising nearly $25 billion, compared to around $3.6 billion for crypto ventures, Mo Shaikh, Co-founder and CEO of Aptos Labs, believes that A.I. and blockchain are not mutually exclusive. Shaikh emphasizes the importance of blockchain’s ability to provide verified and accurate information, minimizing the risk of A.I. models generating false statements or hallucinations. The practical implications of this collaboration are still unfolding. Still, Shaikh underscores elements such as the A.I. assistant and integration into Github Copilot to represent a larger vision of deep integration and co-development between Aptos Labs and Microsoft. APT Rebounds As Collaboration With Microsoft Reignites Investor Interest APT, the native token of the Aptos blockchain, experienced a significant surge of over 17% following the announcement of its partnership with Microsoft. This surge marked a crucial turning point after a prolonged downtrend that persisted since the beginning of February. Notably, APT had reached an all-time high of $20 before succumbing to the downward trend. The decline in APT’s price can be attributed to an unlock event on February 12th, where Aptos released 4.5 million APT tokens. The unlock event, involving the release of a significant number of tokens, resulted in increased selling pressure, leading to a continuous decline in APT’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Hits Peak Since FTX Crash: What It Means However, the recent partnership announcement with Microsoft has injected new life into the token’s value, reigniting investor interest and resulting in a remarkable price surge. Despite experiencing some retracement, APT still holds a 10% profit since the disclosure of the partnership with Microsoft. It is currently trading at $7.3340, representing a 63% decrease from its all-time high reached in January 2023. Overall, investors have responded positively to this news, recognizing the potential of the Aptos-Microsoft partnership to drive innovation and expand the reach of the Aptos blockchain. The substantial surge in APT’s price reflects growing confidence in the project’s prospects and underscores the significance of this collaboration.

42419772,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFnkD,1691600635,PayPal’s Stablecoin Is a Watershed Moment for Finance,"“Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.” – Steve Jobs  On August 7, 2023, PayPal announced that they were launching PYUSD. In five years, we will look back at this exact moment and realize this was the beginning of the turn in history. Why do I say that?  Up until this date, the majority of the builders in crypto were just that: in crypto. The largest companies operating the space were exchanges and stablecoin issuers. The largest market capitalizations were for the blockchains themselves. Most of the activity in the space was deeply self-referential, with the ICO boom, DeFi Summer, and the rise of NFTs all catering primarily to users and builders who were already in the space, enabling them to use more of the technology with each other.  Austin Campbell is the founder and managing partner of Zero Knowledge Consulting, and an adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School.  I’ve called this phenomenon the bad habit of building “more crypto for crypto” elsewhere, but up until this point in time, it is largely what defined the growth and evolution of the industry.  That changed this week. PayPal, one of the largest payments companies in the world with 430 million-plus customers, has planted a flag saying that blockchain technology is important enough that they are willing to spend years building a product to evolve their business model. Of course, PayPal still has the PayPal app (and ubiquitous checkout button), PayPal still has Venmo. But now PayPal also has PYUSD.  Why is this so important?  Blockchains are a fundamentally different form of economic organization. A public blockchain, in particular, is an open, many-to-many interface for exchanging value without needing a centralized intermediary.  PYUSD brings us back to the original promise of blockchain: the ability of a two-legged human, anywhere in the world, to send value to another two-legged human without having to trust or pay a bank (or worse, interminably long string of correspondent banks) to facilitate their transactions. This sort of platform erodes monopolies over time, allowing people to form their own financial connections without the need for centralized counterparties to control them. It returns the power over money to the people.  This week the snowball was pushed from the top of the hill  However, the value of a blockchain cannot be unlocked without something to do with it, and more importantly, something to do with it in the real world. This is where PYUSD alters reality as it comes online in various parts of the world over time. Now, by attaching a blockchain to the traditional PayPal platform, someone can send PYUSD to a relative, to a vendor, or to an employee anywhere in the world. (Or, at least, that’s the plan: for now, PYUSD is available only in the U.S.)  This, of course, was true of previous stablecoins, but here is the important difference: that stablecoin now can become a PayPal balance. It can be easily cashed out through traditional rails. It can be kept as the stablecoin itself, knowing others can use these off-ramps. Liquidity increases value, and options increase value. PayPal, with PYUSD, has moved blockchains (it is building on Ethereum) from just being many-to-many for transactions to being many-to-many for the options of what to do with the value received after the transaction has occurred.  Over time, the adoption of blockchain and faster, cheaper, safer transactions will now grow due to this fundamental shift. There are many companies and individuals sitting on the sidelines, unsure if they can trust crypto-native stablecoins, if crypto-native platforms are stable, and if others are going to use the technology to justify their own time and investment.  PYUSD answers those questions: PayPal is building with the battle-tested NYDFS standard for stablecoins by partnering with Paxos; PayPal has been operating globally for multiple decades running a payments network; and PayPal has handled vast amounts of money safely, securely, and without losing user funds. Now, other builders and companies in the space can compose the PYUSD stablecoin into their own apps, their own protocols, their own wallets, or simply into the backend of their own internal systems, and have confidence it will work.  Likewise, PayPal now has the ability to abstract away the fact that crypto is being used, upgrading the backend while the customer has a similar experience to their current products. This process will not be overnight, but will play out over years, or even decades. This week the snowball was pushed from the top of the hill.  Read more: David Z. Morris - PayPal’s Real Stablecoin Strategy: It Wants to Earn Interest on Your Deposits  The regulatory and geopolitical ramifications of PYUSD should also not be underestimated. Stablecoins are here to stay. As technologists and financial professionals increasingly understand the implications of blockchains, there will be more of these efforts. PYUSD, using what is likely one of the two best regulatory frameworks in the world for stablecoins, is a demonstration that stablecoins can be done safely and with the same principles of fairness, consumer protection and stability that we already value in the traditional financial system.  PYUSD will serve as a call to action for positive technological progress, and a warning to those who thought this would just go away. Those who believed that entrenched, decrepit monopolies would simply grind forward are now finding that they are very, very wrong. PayPal has fired the first shot among traditional firms at scale and become what is likely the first true web 2.5 company in the world, bringing blockchain and finance together at a scale that has previously been unachievable.

This motion marks the second attempt by Musk’s legal team to put an end to the ongoing litigation, and as the legal battle escalates, drawing attention to the intricate interplay between cryptocurrency, high-profile figures, and legal accountability. Strategic Move Amid Escalating Battle The decision to file a second motion for dismissal underscores the determination of Elon Musk’s legal team to swiftly put an end to the protracted litigation. The lawsuit was initiated by a group of Dogecoin investors who claim Musk orchestrated market manipulation and insider trading to inflate the value of the popular meme cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Beware Of Crypto Firms Falsely Claiming To Have Submitted License Applications Attorney Alex Shapiro’s response to the investors’ complaint was sharp and pointed. He framed the latest filing as an example of lawyers overstepping their boundaries and utilizing aggressive litigation tactics. So in the filing, he moved a motion to disqualify sanctions. In one of his statements, Shapiro stated ” Enough is enough” as the case has been a long-standing one. Musk’s legal team also emphasized the legality of his crypto-related statements, while the case has delved into the nebulous realm of social media influence in financial markets. Evan Spencer, the lead attorney for the class action lawsuit, has relentlessly pursued Musk and the allegations against him. Spencer has now made a total of three amendments to the lawsuit since its initial filing in June of the previous year, seeking a staggering $258 billion in damages for investors claiming to have been defrauded by the Tesla CEO with his Dogecoin Pyramid Schemes. DOGE price trading 90% lower than its all-time high price | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com Musk’s Relationship With Dogecoin Dogecoin was designed originally in 2013 as a joke to tease Bitcoin but went from a “meme” to a substantial valuable asset in the cryptocurrency space during 2020 and 2021 especially. Most of the meme coin’s growth was driven by billionaire Elon Musk, who actively promoted the altcoin to his over 100 million Twitter (Now X) followers at the time. His initial tweet in April 2019, playfully endorsing Dogecoin as a potential favorite cryptocurrency, ignited a chain reaction that saw subsequent tweets by Musk triggering substantial price fluctuations. “Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool” Musk tweeted at the time. Musk’s many tweets following this would continuously push DOGE’s price high, reaching as high as $0.7 before the bear market hit. Related Reading: PayPal’s PYUSD Launch Triggers Calls For Stablecoin Bill Since then, DOGE’s price has fallen over 90%, and the class action lawsuit emerged as a result of investors who believed they had fallen victim to a pyramid scheme after buying for high prices. The elongated legal struggle holds significant implications for the cryptocurrency community and the broader financial world. With Musk’s legal team emphasizing the dismissal of the lawsuit, the outcome could set a precedent for legal battles involving influential figures in the cryptocurrency domain. Musk appears to be unmoved as he promotes his newly acquired innovation, Twitter, now rebranded as X.

42410010,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRbfC,1691599922,Congresswoman Maxine Waters Says She’s ‘Deeply Concerned’ About PayPal’s New Stablecoin,"Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California) released a statement Wednesday saying she’s “deeply concerned that PayPal has chosen to launch its own stablecoin while there is still no federal framework for regulation, oversight, and enforcement of these assets.”  PayPal (PYPL) introduced its new dollar-backed stablecoin, PYUSD, on Monday, the first time a global payments firm has issued its own stablecoin.  Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Service Committee, noted that PayPal has 435 million customers around the world, more than the number of online accounts of all the largest banks combined.  “Given PayPal’s size and reach, federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential in order to guarantee consumer protections and alleviate financial stability concerns,” Waters wrote.  The House committee recently approved legislation seeking to set up guardrails for U.S. stablecoins, with several of Waters' fellow Democrats bucking her opposition to vote with Republicans. That bill is now eligible for a floor vote in the House, though it would be unlikely to get a warm welcome from Senate Democrats if approved there.  Waters criticized the Republican-sponsored bill for approving stablecoins like PYUSD that are issued under state regimes but preventing the Federal Reserve from overseeing them.  ""Moreover, the Republican bill undermines the Fed's role as our central bank, making it harder to protect the economy against inflation or support maximum employment if stablecoins are broadly adopted,"" she added.  By contrast, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-North Carolina), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, expressed support for PayPal’s new stablecoin in a statement issued on Monday.  “This announcement is a clear signal that stablecoins — if issued under a clear regulatory framework — hold promise as a pillar of our 21st century payments system,” McHenry wrote.

The increasing uncertainty in the macroeconomic landscape supports the spike in price action, but optimist operators might have been too fast at jumping to their positions.

Why Is The Bitcoin Price Up Today, But Could Be Down Tomorrow All eyes are set on tomorrow’s US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, the proxy to gauge inflation in this country’s fiat currency. A recent report highlights positive expectations for this event, as most investors expect inflation to continue its decline. This might allow the Federal Reserve (Fed) to slow down on its interest rates hike program, finally giving Bitcoin room to break and flip $30,000 into support. However, the report notes that any surprises could trigger the opposite effect. In this scenario, data from crypto analyst firm The King Fisher shows a concentration of long liquidity sitting between the $27,000 to $29,000 levels. As seen in the chart below, this liquidity could operate as a magnet erasing BTC’s gain and pushing it into support. Conversely, positive CPI data could have little to no impact on BTC, allowing it to continue in its current range.

42410019,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRc5e,1691598790,PayPal’s Real Stablecoin Strategy: It Wants to Earn Interest on Your Deposits,"The news this week that PayPal (PYPL) will issue a U.S. dollar stablecoin on the Ethereum network has understandably lit up the crypto world, even setting off a minor rally in other tokens. Optimists see it as a watershed moment of validation for blockchain and smart contracts from a very serious fintech player.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     But there’s reason to suspect that technology per se wasn’t the most persuasive factor for the $64 billion payments giant. Instead, the more immediate motive may be quite simple:  PayPal wants to collect the interest on your dollars.  See, PYUSD, like other reputable dollar stablecoins, will be “backed” by a collection of dollar bank deposits and highly liquid dollar equivalents held in a trust managed by Paxos Trust. Short-dated U.S. Treasuries, which are likely to make up the bulk of PYUSD’s backing, are now offering a whopping 5% yield. PayPal gets to keep that yield.  That puts a different spin on comments this week from Jose Fernandez da Ponte, head of PayPal’s crypto efforts. Da Ponte told CNBC Crypto that “we think of PYUSD as an extension of the PayPal balance … making it available outside of the PayPal ecosystem.”  See also: PayPal's New Stablecoin and the '2 Wolves' Inside Crypto | Opinion  A PayPal balance is the money a customer leaves on the platform — or now with PYUSD, money they leave with PayPal in exchange for PYUSD. Users, for the record, should absolutely not do this at scale, partly because your money is at risk of seizure (and can be seized in stablecoin form). More importantly, you shouldn’t leave a PayPal balance because PayPal doesn't pay any interest. That's why your money became PayPal’s revenue opportunity as soon as underlying interest rates started going up.  How much money do people leave deposited on PayPal?  PayPal doesn’t make the numbers entirely clear. In its quarterly reports, the company reports interest revenue on customer deposits to Wall Street as part of a larger category it calls “Revenues from other Value Added Services.” That includes “interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances,” but also a plethora of other revenue sources, including “referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees and other services.” So that category is not a clear index of how much “float” PayPal is getting from its users.  What we do know is that “value added” revenue is going up much, much faster than transaction fee revenue: It rose 37% between the second quarter of 2022 and the same period in 2023, while transaction revenue rose a measly 4.5%. It seems very likely that rising interest on customer deposits was a major driver of that divergence.  These changing conditions would make a stablecoin vastly more appealing for PayPal, for two straightforward reasons. First, as Da Ponte implied, the extended services enabled by a stablecoin may encourage users to hold a larger amount of money in the form of PYUSD, and to hold it longer. In theory, that could happen if there are simply more ways to use PYUSD than a conventional PayPal balance — for instance, for crypto trading on decentralized-finance platforms. Those larger overall collateral balances would produce more interest for PayPal on the back end.  (PYUSD will initially be available to U.S. users who have purchased crypto on PayPal before, but given the global nature of blockchain will likely be available worldwide in time.)  But far more to the point, a stablecoin could be spent without the underlying balance *ever* having to leave PayPal’s coffers. A rent payment from a PayPal deposit currently has to be turned into real dollars to be sent to a landlord’s bank account, for instance. But the same landlord (or eBay seller, or what have you) might eventually be more willing to accept payment in PYUSD, and then use those tokens in turn to pay contractors or other service providers.  See also: PayPal’s Regulated Stablecoin Is ‘Watershed Moment’ in Crypto  This would mean a smaller proportion of PYUSD users would “cash out” to actual dollars at any given point, leaving PayPal a higher proportion of Treasury or other interest as revenue.

42410027,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRcIs,1691598501,What Is Bitcoin's 'Bart' Pattern and Does It Mean BTC Is Heading Towards a Rally?,"I remember when I realized that Bitcoin had grown up. I can’t remember the date, but I do remember the moment when bitcoin started to trade like a normal security, like a stock or bond. I looked on with pride, much like watching a child taking their first steps—complete with the volatile ups and downs.  Daniel Kelly Kennedy, the director of communications at Mercurity Fintech Holdings, is a businessman, columnist and crypto enthusiast.  As a technical analyst my goal is to identify larger patterns, whether the subject is a security, a sector, an index, a country, a global trend or my armchair psychoanalysis of other people’s behavior. I do know a thing or two about micro technical analysis and I believe, as bitcoin trades in the most boring way imaginable (it's been ""range bound"" for weeks), that we’ve entered one of the most important and interesting times for the price action of the largest cryptocurrency.  The power of now  Bitcoin is currently trading in what is referred to as the ""Bart Simpson pattern,"" a reference to the famous cartoon character's spiky hair when bitcoin trades in certain way. This pattern is most often seen when looking at shorter time frames (and apparently at times of low liquidity; the term reportedly came into vogue during the 2018 bear market).  These price fluctuations are rarer outside of crypto—they appear when there is a sudden price movement, then period of trading close to a particular price (showing up as Bart's iconic zigzags on a price chart) and finish with a sharp price movement in the opposite direction. When Bart’s spiky hair is upright, i.e. when the schoolyard prankster is facing you, it is considered a bearish indicator and when inverted, like Bart doing a handstand, it is treated as a bullish indicator.  Most recently, with BTC is trading between $29,000 and $32,000, give or take a few hundred in either direction, Bart’s head is upright. The pattern began forming after a 20+% move on Wednesday June 14, 2023. At that time BTC was trading at $25,199.30 and on June 23, BTC hit the next level of resistance at $30,644.90. The price has since stalled and continued to consolidate in this tight range for more than a month.  To the moon  Small pieces of news matter, but not as much as we think – put/call options expiring, the Federal Reserve’s decisions, Consumer Price Index and Gross Domestic Product figures, etc. While important in the short term, it’s a mistake to get too focused on these small data points and miss the larger picture: Bitcoin trades macro. On a long enough time line bitcoin seems to just keep climbing, which is why buy and hodl and dollar cost averaging remain the best strategies for trading BTC.  See also: Dollar Cost Averaging: Build Crypto Wealth on a Budget  Small pieces of information only move with the already established trading momentum, like how every drop in the ocean constitutes a wave. The truth is that the drops don’t move, they are pulled—regardless of the will of the individual drops. To look too closely at the minutiae of the daily news is like looking at the finger pointing to the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger or you will miss all the heavenly glory!  Fundamentals vs. the Fed vs. FUD  It’s important to distinguish a real pattern from someone’s imagination. People claim to see these patterns all the time, like some kind of Rorschach test. When all you have is a “hammer candle,” everything looks like a nail. Patterns are simply an indication and are far from a guarantee.  Personally, I believe bitcoin's recent price action is less related to small matters and more related to fundamentals. Something much larger is at play. BTC is due to retest the $31,500 in the coming days and if it breaks above, the sky may just be the limit. And if bitcoin were to close a few convincing candles above this level, it could signify the beginning of the next bull run.  Let’s take a closer look and start with some history for context.  Dec. 22, 2017: $15,075.89. Bitcoin forms a ""Marge"" pattern (it’s a Christmas miracle!). One of bitcoin’s previous highs in recent memory. I chose not to use the actual high during this time since it only touched $19,000 in some pre-Christmas euphoria (we all get a bit heavy with the spending at this time), before selling off and then bouncing around $15,000. $15,000 was arguably the sustained level, what traders mean by a consistent treadline on the charts. It served as support during this short-lived bull run.  Why is this level significant? Let’s look at the next chart.  Nov. 21, 2022: $15,760.10. Bitcoin’s recent bottom. The chart corresponds almost perfectly with the shelf created from the previous highs of 2017.  The halves have not a clue  The bear market has been long and sustained and it appears the mighty beast is just beginning to wake from its slumber. (You can use your imagination as to who Mr. Burns is here, but what I will say is that the resemblance is striking.)  I started calling the bottom around $20,000 with many of you, but I realized recently, bitcoin trades much more fundamentally than that. The charts above demonstrate my argument that $15,000 is a key level, verified by the recent bottom. Given that, BTC has crawled, it has walked and it just might be ready to run again.  Just for fun, here’s another macro prediction: I believe the next bull run will be longer, more sustained and with more controlled, methodical moves as opposed to the spikey runs of bitcoin’s past. Overall, this has been true for bitcoin recently, and is a good thing, attributable to institutional investment. The price action has become less volatile and more predictable over time and is likely to slowly churn up toward new highs as the next halvening approaches.  See also: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Talks Up Crypto Demand  Deny me three times  Now, why is this resistance around $31-$32,000 so significant? Let’s take a closer look at three points on the five year timeframe highlighting key areas of support during the previous bull run.  Bounce #1  Jan. 22, 2021: $32,114.20. Bitcoin pushes higher to continue the bull run after this bounce off the support around $32,000.  Bounce #2  July 16, 2021: $31,576.20. Six months after the bull run began, bitcoin bounces a second time off support at $31,500 to continue the rally to new ATHs.  Bounce #3  May 13, 2022: $30,068.40. This is the most interesting to me, because when you look at the chart, bitcoin’s price is trying to stabilize above $30,000.  Watch the breakdown  June 10, 2022: $28,356.80. As the Drake song goes: Watch the breakdown. In just under a month since the chart above, bitcoin broke below its support level and a sharp sell-off ensued, confirming the official end to the bull run.  So, $30,000, $31,500, and $32,000 all hold historical significance for BTC, — more specifically, the range between $29,000 and $32,000 is literally where the bulls and bears have traditionally collided. Give or take a few hundred dollars on either side, this is almost exactly the range bitcoin has been trading in for over a month.  Charting the present: The ‘Bart pattern’  July 3, 2023: $31,158.80. This was the first test of the key $31,000-$32,000 range.  July 13, 2023: $31,471.80. There was a second attempt at $31,500 but the resistance wins once again and bitcoin drops back down around $29,000. Bitcoin is heading for a third test of this level, providing the thesis for my prediction that we are due for another attempt soon.  Finally, let’s just look at some of the key levels in relation to each other on the max chart (short for maximum time frame rather than a single week or month).  Included are both the relational lines between the previous 2017 high and the recent bottom at around $15,000 levels (indicated in blue) as well as the current resistance around $30,000 in relation to the key support levels during the previous bull run (in red).  Takeaway vs. take-out  Scenario 1: If bitcoin breaks $31,500 and is able to close some candles convincingly above this level, it will act like Bart finally getting freed from detention.  In other words, it could Marge from here…climbing the tall walls of her blue beehive hairdo. It just might Marge.  Scenario 2: Mr. Burns wins. Bitcoin could get beat back at the resistance again, or maybe even lose steam on the way up. In this case, if the pattern is valid, it will likely sell off back down to $25,000, signifying a larger bearish reversal. Either way, Bart’s haircut will be complete.  With such a tight trading range for such a sustained period, it is binary from here—either up or down. It’s anyone’s guess.  The pessimist in me said a few months ago that bitcoin would likely retest its previous bottom of $15,000 before the next bull run. The realist in me says that BTC will simply complete the Bart pattern and retest $25,000. The optimist in me says that there are enough tailwinds with the recent news of the BlackRock ETF filing and Ripple’s high-profile court win (which may set a precedent for future litigation) to signal the bulls are back in town.  Even though the past 40 days or so have felt like when the power goes out and you keep pulling your phone out of your pocket only to realize its dead and you have to find something non-digital to entertain you, it still solidified for me why I love bitcoin so much. Even when it does nothing it remains interesting, if only you know where to look.  I’ve included one final crudely drawn chart for your enjoyment.

42410006,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRbRy,1691598428,"As Curve Averts DeFi Death Spiral, Fiasco Exposes Serious Risks","The worst-case consequences of last month’s Curve exchange hack seem to have been avoided, thanks to a series of side deals cut between the project’s debt-strapped founder and a handful of key crypto players.  But the events still served as an indictment of the prevailing decentralized-finance, or DeFi, narrative since last year’s collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange — that centralized platforms are susceptible to greed and poor risk management while decentralized platforms keep chugging along. It turns out that DeFi is susceptible too.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Curve, a crucial decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain, was hacked last month for over $70 million. The price of CRV, the exchange’s native token, dropped by more than 20% in the immediate aftermath of the exploit.  The event fueled fears around the security and viability of Curve, which is widely considered a “blue-chip” crypto exchange in a crowd of less reputable competitors. The hack also drew attention to a risky lending position from Curve’s founder, Michael Egorov, who put up 33% of the supply of CRV to bank personal loans. If CRV dropped low enough in price, that collateral could have been automatically liquidated by DeFi lending platforms and then dumped onto the open market — tanking a systemically important DeFi asset’s price.  Curve offered its exploiter a 10% bounty in exchange for returned funds, and the platform has managed to recover nearly 75% of the assets lost to the attack. The price of CRV has also rebounded slightly in the past week as the Curve founder has paid down some of his loans, meaning his massive CRV bags are at lower risk of getting liquidated than they were immediately following the hack.  But the Curve fiasco was still a reckoning for one of the largest crypto exchange platforms and held warning signs for DeFi in general.  First, what is Curve?  Launched in 2020, Curve is a decentralized exchange, or DEX, on the Ethereum blockchain.  At a high level, the platform works similarly to DEXs like Uniswap, allowing people to swap between cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries. As with many other DEXs, anyone can deposit crypto into a Curve “pool” — a basket of various cryptocurrencies. The pools are used by other traders to exchange between tokens, with token prices set by the ratio of different assets within a given pool. Pool depositors — so-called “liquidity providers” — earn a portion of the trading fees.  In contrast to the features on Uniswap and most other exchanges, Curve’s features are designed specifically for trading stablecoins and other like-kind assets — digital tokens tied to the price of some other asset. During the DeFi bull run of 2020-21, Curve was at one point the largest DEX by trading volume, amassing more than $20 billion worth of liquidity at its peak.  Why was CRV so important?  In addition to its focus on like-kind assets, the primary feature that allowed Curve to flourish during the last crypto bull run was the platform’s CRV-based incentive structure.  Curve incentivizes liquidity providers to deposit into its pools by rewarding them with CRV tokens atop the regular interest generated from trading fees. The platform offers further rewards to those users who are willing to lock up their CRV in exchange for veCRV — another type of reward. CRV can be locked up for years at a time — the longer the lockup, the bigger the veCRV rewards.  VeCRV doubles as votes in the Curve system, meaning it can be used to influence how Curve distributes rewards to different pools. The pursuit of veCRV led to the “Curve Wars,” where people competed to amass veCRV tokens to direct the flow of rewards to their preferred pools.  The Curve Wars made CRV and veCRV systemically important within the broader DeFi ecosystem. The tokens were used widely in lending and borrowing, they were collected by crypto platforms looking to drive liquidity to their own Curve pools, and they powered a variety of offshoot platforms, like Convex, built specifically to capitalize on Curve’s reward system.  Beware the incentive game  Curve’s dominance has faded in recent months as the bear market has eaten into the price of CRV, allowing newer competitors, like Uniswap V3, to seize some of the platform’s market share. According to DefiLlama, Curve now boasts $2.4 billion in deposits, or just a tenth of the peak of $24 billion in 2022.  The CRV price has likewise decreased to 60 cents, down from around $6 at its 2022 peak and down 20% since last month’s hack.  “I think Curve will have issues now as a result of people second-guessing the Curve token,” said Sid Powell, CEO of Maple Finance, a blockchain-based credit marketplace that offers DeFi services to institutions and accredited investors.  The long-term viability of Curve’s CRV reward program — a vestige of DeFi’s early days, where money-printing machines in the form of token issuances were the go-to model for attracting users — seems less certain now, in light of the CRV price declines. Powell called the system “Ponzinomics.”  “It is kind of like a melting iceberg scenario, where they have to find some way to add or recreate utility for CRV,” said Powell. “Otherwise, there would be no point in having it,” because the rewards for using Curve without CRV — the interest generated purely from trading fees — is a pittance relative to what users get from CRV bonuses.  “I'm watching what that second-order effect is for Curve TVL (total value locked) and the number of protocols that are kind of built on Curve TVL,” he added. “If the CRV token rewards are removed or valueless, what would happen to Convex at that point?”  CoinDesk attempted to consult Egorov, the Curve founder, for this story but was unsuccessful.  “Blue chip” doesn’t mean fool-proof  Over time, Curve has earned a reputation as a “blue-chip” decentralized exchange — one of the relatively few safe protocols in a sea of buggy ones. It was relatively simple in its design, and until July, it was one of the few big DeFi platforms to avoid any major hacks.  The Curve exploit served as a reminder that scale doesn't equal security.  Last month’s attack happened as a result of a bug in the compiler for Vyper, which is a programming language similar to Solidity that allows people to code up smart contracts. The specific vulnerability in Vyper’s code, a so-called re-entrancy attack, allowed a hacker to repeatedly withdraw funds from Curve without the protocol realizing that it had already sent the funds.  While Curve is well-known, Vyper is not. The vulnerability in Vyper drew attention to the myriad avenues by which attackers can theoretically sabotage decentralized systems, and it is possible that the risks will only become greater as the code powering DeFi platforms becomes more complex.  Decentralized protocols vs. centralized token supply  In the months leading up to July’s exploit, Egorov took out around $100 million worth of loans. As collateral, he used around $200 million worth of CRV — 33% of all CRV in existence.  If the price of CRV fell low enough, Egorov's position would have been liquidated, meaning his collateral would have been dumped onto the market. That could have triggered a full collapse of CRV, which is relatively illiquid but remains systemically important to DeFi.  The fact that the founder of “blue-chip” decentralized-finance protocol was able to amass more than a third of its native token’s supply and then put it up as collateral to back millions of dollars in loans should have raised eyebrows, according to experts, because of its potential ramifications for the protocol and for DeFi as a whole.  “I don't necessarily think it's a sign of unethical behavior, but it does open up risks — exactly as you've seen occur — and the risks are not too hard to predict,” remarked Powell. “If you have a $100 million loan, and you have that on leverage, and it's against your token, there's a chance your token could drop in price and you’ll need to liquidate it to cover yourself.”  DeFi doesn’t offer full transparency  Egorov managed to de-risk his lending positions by paying down portions of his loans, decreasing the price at which his CRV would be subject to liquidation. Egorov, however, needed to make over-the-counter deals with big-money crypto “whales” like Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, in order to finance these payments.  It wasn’t the first time that a big player like Sun has stepped in to prevent a crypto collapse. It was a reminder, after a handful of similar ones, that power in decentralized finance rests with just a handful of actors — a scenario not dissimilar to traditional finance.  As CoinDesk’s Daniel Kuhn argued in a deftly written column last week, “the spirit that propelled DeFi forward, the dream of disintermediating money from power and providing easy access to basic and complex financial products without fear or favor is dead.”  It’s true, as Adam Blumberg pointed out in a response to Kuhn’s column, that blockchain technology enabled minute-by-minute visibility into the health of Egorov’s lending positions — transparency that’s possible only in the world of decentralized finance, where transactions and wallet addresses are all publicly viewable. However, the full influence of big actors like Justin Sun remains opaque, and it will only become more so as whales become more sophisticated with how they obfuscate the scale of their holdings.  “On-chain transactions do not represent the asset exposure that the underlying trader necessarily has,” said Sacha Ghebali, a strategy analyst at crypto analytics firm The TIE.  “It’s no different from traditional financial markets,” he continued. “At some point there is a limit in terms of how much transparency these systems manage to carry, even when you get the impression of transparency.”",NEGATIVE,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/09/as-curve-averts-defi-death-spiral-fiasco-exposes-serious-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e754a9d464d9c42ef499d2d5ba90a478067649f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15830833,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546436,1691596831,Bitcoin Open Interest Hits Peak Since FTX Crash: What It Means,"In a market that has been relatively quiet for weeks, Bitcoin (BTC) has suddenly sprung to life, with its Futures Open Interest (OI) reaching levels not seen since the FTX crash. Open Interest, a metric that measures the total number of outstanding futures that have not been settled, provides a glimpse into the trading activity and potential future price movements of an asset. A surge in OI can indicate heightened trading activity and interest in the market. Starting early Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price action surged by more than 3.5%, breaking the $30,300 mark for the second time this month. This movement began around 5 am EST, pushing the price to a 16-day-high. The catalyst behind this surge seemed to be the rumor that insiders at BlackRock and Invesco have confirmed that a Bitcoin spot ETF is not a question of “if” but “when”, suggesting an approval within the next four to six months. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Surging Today? “Bitcoin whales opened giga long positions at $29k,” remarked CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju. The Head of Research at CryptoQuant further added, “A lot of talk lately about increasing probability of Bitcoin spot ETF approval in the US. Now Coinbase premium sharply up and moving towards positive territory (implies Bitcoin demand in the US is strengthening). GBTC price discount has continued to narrow.” Bitcoin Futures Open Interest Skyrockets To Yearly High Aggregate OI for Bitcoin futures saw a significant jump, increasing by over $1 billion from the previous day to a staggering $14.95 billion, according to Coinglass data. This surge marks the most substantial increase in over a month. However, derivatives activity on the CME, often seen as a gauge of institutional trading, remained relatively unchanged in OI, suggesting that the recent move might be predominantly retail-driven. Miles Deutscher commented on Twitter, “Bitcoin open interest is now at its highest level since the FTX collapse. This indicates increased BTC trading activity from market participants. Looks like a big move is brewing.” Similarly, James V. Straten observed, “Bitcoin open interest is now greater than 2.25% of the market cap, approaching YTD highs, and looks exceptionally overheated.” The Kingfisher, a renowned data provider for Bitcoin derivatives, noted, “Coinbase selling into every other major exchange buying. Looks like Bybit & Bitmex degens are betting on another $BTC leg up. While Bitfinex seems to be selling here.” Related Reading: Will Record Low Volatility Awaken A Behemoth Bitcoin Surge? 4,000% Signal Returns On the options front, the analysts added that dealers seem bullish, ready to capitalize on both upward and downward movements. Their buying activity is currently stabilizing the price, while any significant upward trajectory could see them intensifying their buying. Meanwhile, the BTC liquidation map of The Kingfisher indicates that while there are still “some late high-leverage shorts to liquidate to the upside, but most of the short-term liquidity is down.” Renowned analyst @52kskew provided insights into the BTC whale vs. algo divergence, stating, “Whales require quite thick liquidity to exit or close positions & most often this is during a squeeze event. Some firms will use algos in order to get the best price when closing out sizeable position (this is where TWAP algos come into play).” CPI Release To Take Out The Heat? Notably, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the US is scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday, 8:30 am EST. The release has the potential to cause a mass liquidation of the overheated BTC futures market in both directions. A major move by the BTC price seems imminent. Forecasts suggest a rise in the headline CPI from 3% to 3.3% year-over-year (YoY) for July, marking a significant transition as the positive impacts from the prior year start to wane. Notably, the Cleveland Fed’s Inflation Nowcast model projects a 3.42% headline CPI, marginally surpassing general expectations. Core CPI is expected to slightly decline from 4.8% to 4.7% YoY. At press time, the BTC price was just below key resistance at $30,000.

42410017,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRbp7,1691596800,Coinbase Officially Launches Base Blockchain in Milestone for a Public Company,"Coinbase (COIN), the large publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange, said its new Base blockchain has gone live, heralding the start of a new era of public companies running their own distributed networks.  Base was already live for testing by developers, but Coinbase officials said it would be open to the public as of 12 p.m. ET on Wednesday, and that time has now passed.  The new business push for Coinbase, which has one of the most closely followed crypto stocks, could ultimately allow the company to garner fees from running its own blockchain, in addition to a potentially even more lucrative stream of revenue from applications built atop it, executives say.  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote in a ""secret master plan"" in 2016 that the fourth phase of the company's development would come from ""decentralized apps,"" or dapps, designed to reach one billion people. The company held a direct listing of its shares on Nasdaq in April 2021.  Jesse Pollak, who is overseeing Base as Coinbase's head of protocols, said Tuesday in an interview that 100 dapps were already deployed or ready to go on the new network.  ""Historically, the aperture of what people can do with crypto has been relatively limited, mostly speculation,"" Pollak said. ""In order for Coinbase and crypto and this work that we're doing to have the impact that we all want, we need to move from the place where this is speculation to a place where this is integrated into every part of someone's day-to-day existence.""  In connection with the Base launch, Coinbase announced plans for an ""Onchain Summer"" promotion with corporate partners, including Coca-Cola (KO), to show off the new project's capabilities.  Read More: Coinbase Exec: ‘There’s No Playbook’ for Public Company Launching Blockchain  Base L2 ranking  The new Base network is technically a “layer 2” blockchain built atop of the Ethereum blockchain, using OP Stack software from another popular layer 2 network, Optimism.  Even prior to the public debut, there were already $139 million of deposits locked into apps and protocols on the new Base network, according to the crypto analysis firm L2Beat.  That amount of “total value locked” or TVL a common metric for evaluating blockchains and protocols — is enough to rank Base as the fifth-largest layer-2 blockchain.

42410014,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRbvj,1691596800,The Right Way to (Passively) Invest in Crypto: Crypto Long & Short,"Passive investing strategies have gained popularity in crypto, following the trend set in traditional finance — where benchmark-tracking ETFs and index funds are a huge force. But it’s important to engineer indexes that can grapple with the shortcomings and inefficiencies of the nascent asset class of digital assets.  Smart-beta indexing – a primer  Indexes weighted by market capitalization long dominated passive investing in stocks. They have their origins in “Modern Portfolio Theory,” which traces back to the works of Harry Markowitz and William Sharpe in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. Since the creation of the first index fund by John Bogle in 1975, market cap-weighted indexes have been considered the industry standard — not only from an academic practical point of view, but also from a practical one. It was only in 1992 that Eugene Fama and Kenneth French developed a three-factor model that empirically explained stock returns better and was an extension of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. In addition to the well-known beta, small-market caps and low price-to-book ratios were added as systematic risk factors.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Over the years, new factors and alternative weighting methodologies have been introduced, aiming to exploit market inefficiencies. Some of the most well-known factors include momentum, minimum volatility, quality and dividends. Alternative weighting methodologies include equal weighting, risk parity and maximum diversification.  A buzz term was eventually developed to describe this: smart beta. It was first put into practice in 2003 with the S&P 500 equal-weighted index. Since then, thousands of smart-beta ETFs have been approved for trading in both the U.S. and Europe. Currently, around $1.7 trillion is managed this way in ETFs in equities in the U.S. alone. Despite their apparent success, however, this represents a relative pittance versus ETFs weighted by market cap.  Why engineering smart-beta indexes matters in crypto  In the world of crypto indexing, benchmark creators have brought over market cap-weighting from traditional finance one-to-one. That approach, however, may not lead to optimal results, especially in the relatively nascent and evolving asset class of cryptocurrencies. It can result in significant market concentration in just a couple of constituents such as bitcoin and ether, thus defeating the fundamental goal of index investing: diversification.  Another mistake made by many crypto index providers is defining the market universe too broadly, creating indexes that are not investable or not sufficiently liquid, especially during crises. To be tradable on traditional exchanges, the underlying index constituents must demonstrate a minimum level of liquidity across widely accessible liquidity venues. Therefore, liquidity-based index exclusion criteria significantly narrow the investable universe.  Additionally, in the crypto sector, it is essential to establish qualitative inclusion criteria. Unlike in the stock world, where companies are thoroughly examined by regulators, banks and auditors before being listed on an exchange, crypto projects and tokens are subject to limited due diligence, resulting in unforeseen debacles such as Terra/Luna and FTX. Rigorous analysis can help avoid such situations.  To address these issues, it is important to avoid the common pitfalls of market cap-weighted indexes and limit the investment universe to the top coins by market liquidity.  While the possibilities are almost endless, we have decided to build an index that is based on a combination of risk parity and market capitalization. The risk-parity weighting scheme aims to balance the risk contributions of index constituents resulting in an index that over-weights smaller coins compared with a market cap-weighted one, achieving higher diversification. Although there may be market phases where such an index lags behind the overall market, there is a high probability that the index will outperform the market over an entire market cycle.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Gregory Mall,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/09/the-right-way-to-passively-invest-in-crypto-crypto-long-short,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c888ce622f002e1bee9efe3785053ad6a4f22d3b-3072x1728.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410002,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRbI3,1691596800,Coca-Cola and Friends With Benefits Headline Base’s ‘Onchain Summer’ Web3 Festival,"Onchain Summer celebrates the launch of Coinbase's new layer 2 network, Base, with multiple events each week.  Coca-Cola and popular DAOs like Friends With Benefits and Nouns are participating in different activations.  Let’s face it: non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren’t having a hot girl summer.  Perhaps “Onchain Summer,” crypto exchange Coinbase’s (COIN) event to celebrate the launch of its native Base network, can help bolster the tokens’ trading volume.  Onchain Summer, which kicked off today in celebration of Base’s mainnet launch, is a series of Web3 activations across art, gaming and music. Through the end of August, over 50 brands, including Coca-Cola, Friends With Benefits, a social decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and NFT creator platform Zora will host NFT mints on Base network.  In addition to branded NFT offerings, Coinbase is collaborating with Prop House, an incubator linked to NFT project Nouns DAO, to give out over 100 ETH, or $186,000, in grants for developers building on Base. They’re also encouraging developers to enroll in the ETH Global Superhack, an upcoming hackathon that will offer $175,000 in rewards.  To bolster community engagement around Base, Coinbase is encouraging users to bridge their ether to Base in order to mint a free NFT to commemorate the launch of the Base mainnet. According to data from Etherscan, over 125,000 individuals have minted over 30 million free NFTs so far.  In a year where NFT trading volume has fallen almost 50% since January, Web3 projects are struggling to scale. Jesse Pollak, Protocols Lead at Coinbase, told CoinDesk that Onchain Summer aims to showcase how NFTs can be leveraged as a technology rather than just a speculative asset.  “We wanted to give people a reason to be on-chain this summer and set up their first wallet and experience this future,” said Pollak.  Onchain Summer’s first week will feature daily mints, starting with Friends With Benefits, who will issue an NFT on Thursday designed by artist Deekay Kwon alongside pseudonymous NFT collector Cozomo de Medici. On Saturday, Coca-Cola will open a mint of digital artworks from the Masterpiece collection, with works from artists Aket, Fatma Ramadan and Vikram Kushwah, as well as famed painters Edvard Munch, Johannes Vermeer and Vincent van Gogh.  “The world will come on-chain because of great product experiences that people all over the world build,” said Pollak. “That's where we're focused on.”  Base is an Ethereum layer 2 network built upon Optimism’s OP Stack. Last week, Coinbase made its Base public launch date official after having opened its mainnet early for developers in July who wanted to begin testing the network. However, during this testing period, an anonymous developer created the infamous BALD token on Base network, which rose to an $85 million market capitalization before plunging when its creator pulled most of the projects’ liquidity, rugging holders.

This audacious breach was reportedly the culmination of a six-month saga marked by calculated maneuvers and sophisticated tactics, orchestrated by none other than the notorious Lazarus Group. Collaborating with Match Systems, CoinsPaid embarked on a comprehensive inquiry, unearthing the modus operandi of the hacking group and exposing the subsequent laundering of pilfered assets in a post. Elaborate 6-Month Operation By Lazarus Group The ploy, characterized by an extraordinary level of meticulousness, spanned half a year, revealing the calculated and relentless nature of the hack. Employing a blend of social engineering and technical strategies, the hackers engaged in a series of Distributed Denial-of-Service and brute-force attacks. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Says He Is Willing To Bet That Ripple Will Win SEC Appeal Their calculated approach culminated in a July 22 breach with the manipulation of a CoinsPaid employee, ensnaring them through a falsified job proposition. The ordeal began innocently enough, as a CoinsPaid employee embarked on a video interview for what appeared to be an enticing career prospect, facilitated via LinkedIn. Little did they know that the seemingly innocuous task of downloading a technical assessment was part of an elaborate ruse orchestrated by the hackers. This single act granted the hackers access to CoinsPaid’s systems, allowing them to exploit software vulnerabilities and authorize unauthorized withdrawals from the company’s hot wallets. The hacker executed a swift sequence of unauthorized withdrawals, swiftly depleting the company’s coffers in less than an hour of operation. In total, CoinsPaid lost $37.3 million in the attack. Total market cap jumps to $1.147 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com CoinsPaid Moving Forward From The Incident CoinsPaid’s exhaustive post-mortem report reveals invaluable lessons extracted from the breach. The report highlights the importance of training employees to identify social engineering tactics, including job offers that might be a ploy to gain access to internal systems. The report also explains the adoption of principles like the Separation of Duties and Least Privilege, advocating for the implementation of robust monitoring and alert systems to detect suspicious activities. Following the report, CoinsPaid will be hosting a roundtable discussion involving blockchain-based entities, aiming to collectively address the escalating threat posed by hacking incidents.

In an interview with technology magazine Wired, the Canadian musician and producer, whose real name is Claire Elise Boucher, was asked if she made more money off of NFTs than she has across her entire music career. She responded with a simple “yeah.”  During the hype cycle of 2021, Grimes sold her “War Nymph” NFTs on platform Nifty Gateway, earning roughly $6 million in revenue. The collection featured a series of digital artworks set to her music, as well as a one-of-one music video that sold for almost $400,000.  NFTs have taken a back seat in pop culture, as their trading volume has fallen nearly 50% since the beginning of the year. Grimes, however, told Wired that she’s hopeful the tokens can return to help artists earn profits on their work.  “I’m sad about what happened to NFTs and crypto, because it got polluted fast with people trying to make as much money as possible,” Grimes said. “But I do want to think about compensating artists, especially digital artists.""  Beyond just NFTs, Grimes is bullish on Web3. In October 2021, Grimes, artist Lil Nas X and influencer Bella Poarch contributed videos to social-media platform TikTok’s “Top Moments” NFT collection. In March 2022, she spoke at the Avalanche Summit in Spain, explaining her plans to create a metaverse children’s book with support from Web3 artificial-intelligence platform OP3N and Avalanche’s $100 million fund to fuel development on the network.  She’s also bullish on AI generally. She invited fans to use an AI version of her voice to make new music, offering a 50/50 split on any royalties, and was impressed by the work produced from the experiment.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/08/09/grimes-made-more-money-with-nfts-than-in-her-entire-music-career-wired,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77b63367ea5d11a84a0181947350fec3759c1e9e-4368x2912.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since then, speculations have abounded regarding if the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the first Spot Bitcoin ETF given its track record. But according to insiders, the first approval may not be far off. Approval Coming Soon For First Spot Bitcoin ETF Citing his sources at BlackRock and Invesco, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz stated that the SEC will likely give the green light for these Bitcoin ETFs within the next four to six months. The CEO said this on an earnings call with investors where he maintained a bullish stance on the firm’s Bitcoin strategy. Related Reading: Beware Of Crypto Firms Falsely Claiming To Have Submitted License Applications “Our contacts from the Invesco side and from the BlackRock side gets you to think that this is a question of when, not if, that the outside window this is probably six months,” Novogratz said during the company’s Q2 earnings call on August 8. “And so you’re– kind of your four to six months, if you had to put a pin the tail on the donkey audit.” During the earnings call, the Galaxy Digital CEO noted that the Spot Bitcoin ETF application by BlackRock, which happens to be the largest asset manager, has sparked a positive sentiment from institutional investors towards the foremost cryptocurrency. He also highlighted how BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s change of mind from being a Bitcoin skeptic to a proponent has arguably led the Bitcoin adoption charge in the asset management industry. In 2017, Fink labeled Bitcoin an “index of money laundering.” However, the CEO of the largest investment firm in the world has since changed his stance, and Fink has advocated for Bitcoin, rightly labeling it as the first “global money.” BTC price recovers following improved market sentiment | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Competition Is Going To Be Hot Novogratz told investors on the call that he recognizes that the competition will be hot once the various spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved. He, however, reaffirmed his company’s intention to claim a large chunk of the ETF market share. According to him, “We’re going to fight like cats and dogs to win market share once it’s approved.” Other prominent firms that are major contenders for a Spot Bitcoin ETF include Invesco (the US fourth-largest ETF manager), Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, Wisdom Tree (the 10th largest ETF manager), Fidelity, Grayscale, and Valkyrie. Related Reading: ARK Invest’s CEO Says SEC Could Approve Multiple Spot Bitcoin ETFs Simultaneously While it remains uncertain in what order the SEC will approve these applications (or whether they will be approved together), many believe that a first-mover advantage could be key to determining which of these firms enjoy a huge chunk of the market share in the spot Bitcoin ETF industry. That is why it isn’t surprising that Valkyrie recently filed an application to the SEC to amend its Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF) to include ETH futures contracts, in a move that could see it launch ahead of other firms applying for an Ethereum futures ETF.

Judges and guest stars include crypto personalities Brian D. Evans, Layah Heilpern, George Tung and ""BitBoy Crypto.""  Take “The Apprentice,” add a dash of “Shark Tank” and toss in 16 crypto enthusiasts competing for a six-figure prize package and you’ve got “The Next Crypto Gem,” a new competition reality show that will make its debut in September.  The show will pit contestants against one another in challenges to win a prize package estimated to be worth $150,000. It will feature well-known crypto influencers Brian D. Evans, Layah Heilpern and George Tung as judges as well as guest stars, including original “Shark Tank” cast member Kevin Harrington and infamous crypto personality YouTuber Ben Armstrong, who is better known as “BitBoy Crypto.”  Executive Producer Jett Tang said the heart of the show is to bring crypto to a “mainstream audience for the first time. The teamwork, the rivalry, the larger-than-life characters and the out-the-box ideas.”  One important aspect of the show, Tang told CoinDesk, “is to bring in mainstream adoption and to really show crypto, make crypto interesting and entertaining.”  Tang shared that the first episode’s challenge involves people who were “the least likely to understand crypto and the most unfriendly to crypto.” The contestants are then broken into four teams that need to prove they can explain the basics of blockchain to the “no coiners” to win the challenge.  The education element continues throughout each of the six weeks of challenges, with what Tang called “The Big Short” moments throughout where the judges break in to explain a key crypto term or concept.  While the educational component is important, the show’s focus is on capturing crypto culture and the eclectic characters found in the industry. That is why some of the more controversial crypto figures came to be involved with the show, such as ""BitBoy Crypto,"" who has faced backlash for promoting certain crypto projects on his popular YouTube channel, most notably for hyping now-bankrupt lender Celsius Network.  Tang said he wanted to have diversity in the challenges and “big personalities” to see how the contestants handled that aspect of crypto culture. Tang has also tapped non-crypto personalities as guest stars, such as professional high-stakes poker player Tom Dwan who regularly appears on “High Stakes Poker” and recently won $3.1 million in the largest televised cash pot in history.  “The Next Crypto Gem” will begin airing on Sept. 7, on Insight TV and can be seen on major distribution platforms such as Amazon Prime and Pluto TV as well as hardware platforms like Samsung, Vizio LG and others.

The seed round was led by Blockchange Ventures with participation from Dispersion Capital, Symbolic Capital, Hypersphere Ventures, ICLUB and TA Ventures.  Periodic attacks on public blockchain-based systems and decentralized finance (DeFi) have earned the sector a reputation as a playground for hackers and cyber criminals, where the financial incentives for bad actors are generally much higher than in the current, so-called Web2, world.  When there’s a wave of innovation, typically a wave of crime comes with it, which is what motivated Cube3.ai founder and CEO Einaras Gravrock, a seasoned builder of Web2 security platforms, to go beyond essentials such as manual code audits and post-attack alerts to create a system that checks crypto transactions in real time.  Cube3.ai uses machine learning and pattern matching to give newly deployed smart contracts a risk score. Criminals continually deploy new contracts from new wallets that moments later may propose a malicious transaction against a target contract. This leaves only a short window to evaluate new contracts for malicious intent, Gravrock said.  “On behalf of our clients, we equip decentralized applications and smart contracts to identify exploits, and then to decline exploits as they are being proposed,” said Gravrock in an interview with CoinDesk. “It means contracts and applications can carry on processing legitimate transactions, so it’s a bit like a guardian angel is watching over your contract.”",POSITIVE,없음,OTHER,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/09/web3-security-startup-cube3ai-emerges-from-stealth-with-82m-seed-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea94a6f41f11bebbd52fec9e83740c6d20bc7408-2560x1440.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410022,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRcCG,1691583536,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Flirts With $30K as Traders Await CPI,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose 2.3% in the past 24 hours to close to $30,000 as investors wait for July's Consumer Price Index, a gauge of inflation in the U.S., which is scheduled to be released on Thursday. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to come in at 0.4%, far below the pace seen a year ago. Lower inflation should mean the Federal Reserve will be less likely to raise rates. Oliver Rust, head of product at independent inflation data aggregator Truflation, predicts that the inflation numbers will show that CPI spiked from 3% to 3.4% in July. “Over the past three months, the rapid decline in inflation allowed consumers to regain their purchasing power, with wages growing at a faster rate than prices. This has resulted in the resurgence of rampant consumer spending, pushing up prices in the all-important food category,” Rust wrote in a morning note.  The Fed is starting a new program for overseeing banks’ crypto activity, and it further clarified its requirement that the lenders under its authority get approval before engaging in digital-assets activities. The move announced Tuesday doesn’t change any rules for crypto banking. Rather, it just defines how the central bank intends to handle oversight, putting dealings with the crypto sector under the new “novel activities supervision program” in which the Fed’s specialized experts in digital assets will work alongside the regulator’s regular supervisors. The Fed also issued a fuller explanation for how the banks it supervises need to get preapprovals for engaging with stablecoins. An institution that’s “issuing, holding or transacting in dollar tokens to facilitate payments” needs to prove to the supervisors beforehand that it can do so in a “safe and sound manner” and needs the Fed to formally sign off.  Binance received two licenses to operate in El Salvador as it seeks to build its legitimacy worldwide, the crypto exchange said Tuesday, adding that it now has licenses in 18 markets. The Central Bank of El Salvador granted Binance a Bitcoin Services Provider license, while the Salvadoran National Commission of Digital Assets issued a non-provisional Digital Assets Services Provider license, the company said in a statement. “These licenses allow Binance to expand the products and services offered including options tailored to the needs of our customers in El Salvador,"" Daniel Acosta, general manager for Colombia, Central America and Caribbean at Binance, said in the statement.  Chart of the Day  Investors are betting that Federal Reserve's tightening cycle has ended and it will cut interest rates next year. But, inflation expectations are rising.

Bitcoin Profit-Taking Volume Is Currently More Than Twice The Loss-Taking One Bitcoin showed some promising signs of breaking away from its stagnation earlier during the past 24-hour period, as the cryptocurrency’s price managed to make a sharp recovery towards the $30,000 mark. This surge, however, couldn’t last for too long, as the cryptocurrency has already slipped to the $29,700 level. BTC has seen some rise during the past day | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView So far, Bitcoin has been able to retain a lot of the recovery despite this pullback, as the asset’s price is still significantly above the $29,000 level it had been consolidating at prior to this move. From the above chart, it’s visible that the current recovery surge looks quite similar to the one seen around the start of the month. This rally also died off at the $30,000 level and the price slid off, until it eventually ended up slumping back to sideways movement around the $29,000 mark. Related Reading: Litecoin Long-Term Holders Smartly Exited Before Halving, Data Shows It would appear that the $30,000 level was acting as a major source of resistance for the cryptocurrency back then, and it seems that its role hasn’t changed this time either. There is one thing different this time, however, and that is the level of profit-taking that the investors are displaying. According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the profit-taking in the market has observed a sharp increase as this rally has occurred. The value of the metric seems to have been quite high recently | Source: Santiment on X In the above graph, the data for the “ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss” metric is shown, which keeps track of how the profit-taking volume in the Bitcoin market compares with the loss-taking volume right now. Clearly, this indicator has surged to some pretty high levels, meaning that the profit realization is far outweighing the loss realization at the moment. It’s not uncommon for this behavior to be seen during rallies, as some investors would want to quickly jump on the profitable opportunity while it’s still there. This scale of the profit-taking, however, may be worrying. At the current level of the indicator, the profit-taking volume is more than double the loss-taking volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Show Accumulation Again, Bullish Sign? As can be seen from the graph, the metric had instead remained relatively muted when the aforementioned recovery rally of a similar scale had taken place earlier in the month. This difference in behavior between the two Bitcoin price surges may be a reflection of how the investors have perceived each move. Earlier, they may have been more hopeful for further price rise, so they may not have been too keen on harvesting their profits just yet. This time, however, the holders may be thinking that this rise will die out like the previous one as well, so they are using the opportunity to quickly exit from the market.

Crypto analyst CoinsKid has highlighted the potential for a significant price surge if XRP manages to overcome a crucial technical barrier. The concept at play here is the so-called Fibonacci retracement level, a powerful tool used by traders to identify potential price reversals and continuations in financial markets. Related Reading: Can Litecoin Bulls Turn The Tide On Recent Declines? A Closer Look In the context of cryptocurrency trading, these levels are drawn on a price chart to highlight potential support and resistance levels. They are calculated based on percentages derived from the Fibonacci sequence, with the 78.6% retracement level considered a significant threshold. If a cryptocurrency like XRP manages to breach this level, it often signals a substantial shift in market sentiment. CoinsKid Predicts XRP’s Potential Trajectory CoinsKid recently provided a comprehensive analysis of XRP’s price action. In a detailed video on his YouTube channel, he emphasized the significance of a corrective phase for the cryptocurrency. According to CoinsKid’s analysis, once XRP completes this correction and successfully surpasses the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level, currently situated at $1.30, a substantial buying opportunity may arise. This development, he speculates, could pave the way for an ambitious price target of $21 by the year 2025. Related Reading: Is Curve DAO (CRV) Price On Track To Reach Or Exceed $1 This Month?

The crypto exchange posted on Twitter: Me, the intern, patiently waiting for @Gemini to list XRP. (i want some) pic.twitter.com/I7r7QBjYKR — Gemini (@Gemini) August 7, 2023 While the exact nature of this announcement remains shrouded in mystery, such teases from established exchanges often provoke market interest and excitement. As of the latest update, XRP is trading at approximately $0.639893, according to CoinGecko. The past 24 hours have witnessed a modest 3.4% rally, signaling potential short-term momentum. However, over the past week, XRP has faced a slight setback, experiencing an 8.7% decline in its value. XRP market cap reached $33.9 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com These price dynamics underscore the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing the importance of robust analysis and well-informed trading decisions. The cryptocurrency community finds itself at an intriguing juncture with XRP, as technical analysis and market dynamics converge. CoinsKid’s insights regarding the Fibonacci retracement level offer a roadmap for potential price movements, while Gemini’s enigmatic tweet fuels speculation about future developments.

Rollbit allows users to trade tokens using 1000x leverage, and offers sports betting and arcade games, as well as a tokenized jackpot. Platform data shows over $2.5 billion worth of crypto futures were traded on Rollbit in the past 24 hours alone.  In a Tuesday tweet, co-founder “Lucky” said 30% of all fees generated from crypto futures, 20% from sports betting and 10% from casino games would be used to purchase RLB on the open market and be burned – or permanently removed from supply by sending the tokens to an address that is not controlled by anyone.  Rollbit's revenue crossed over $2 million in the past 24 hours across these services, data shows. This means a significant amount – after costs – will use to fund RLB purchases daily.  Such a move could set perpetual buying pressure on RLB as long as platform usage continues to grow.  Rollbit has recorded one of the fastest growth among crypto protocols this year due to a strong market fit and a generally well-received product among gamblers and traders.

42410009,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcRbYa,1691577141,Trader Who Predicted Luna's Downfall Now Holds 450K MOON Tokens,"Pseudonymous trader GCR, who made a $10 million bearish bet against Terra's LUNA cryptocurrency in early 2022, is holding large amounts of Reddit's community token Moons (MOON), an on-chain expert said, confirming claims made by a trending Reddit post.  The post by Reddit user Nutcase420 in r/CryptoCurrency subReddit alleges that GCR bought 450,000 MOON tokens from the MEXC exchange, and 24 hours ago, transferred the same to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken via Arbitrum Nova. Moons is an ERC-20 token distributed as a reward for comments or posts in the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit channel.  The post cites a tweet, which says the Kraken deposit address — 0x5D1177F01f6607628b78fB29C73C8de751B28839 — is associated with GCR because it has previously received large amounts of ether (ETH) from GCR's Ethereum name service domain @GiganticRebirth: Ezekielx.eth.  CoinDesk reached out to GCR on Twitter, but didn't hear back.  Meanwhile, Prithvi Jhaveri, co-founder and CEO of Loch Research, confirmed the speculation.  ""After conducting a bit of on-chain analysis, we were able to confirm that this Kraken address is associated with GCR. He sent millions of ETH to it from an ENS that’s confirmed to be his Ezekielx.eth. He bought 450k MOON at an average price of 40 cents-45 cents,"" Jhaveri told CoinDesk, adding that it is unclear when GCR acquired MOON tokens.  Social media is hailing GCR's supposed MOON holdings as a bullish catalyst for the token. ""Well this was some unexpected awesome news. The positive Moons headlines keep happening, don’t know how much more I can take. What’s next, Moons on Coinbase?,"" one member commented on the GCR post in the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit.  MOON surged over 50% early this week after Kraken listed the token.  Early last year, GCR shorted Terra's LUNA token for $10 million, betting against Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon that the cryptocurrency would trade lower than $88 by March 2023.

Puffer Finance recognizes the challenges validators face in the Ethereum Proof of Stake network, such as the risk of losing all ETH staked to slashing penalties. Secure-Signer is a remote signing tool designed to prevent validators from committing slashable offenses, limiting access to validator keys to mitigate the effect of software bugs and user errors to protect stakers from costly penalties that disproportionately impact solo stakers. In addition, Puffer Finance is working on a protocol to lower the barrier of entry for at-home stakers and provide access to additional streams of revenue, allowing for a financially viable alternative to centralized Liquid Staking Providers. With the advancement of Ethereum’s ZK-rollup adoption, Puffer validators can also potentially earn additional revenue through unique restaking services that are exclusive to Puffer’s tech stack. Jason Vranek and Amir Forouzani, Co-founders of Puffer, expressed excitement about the collaboration with LBank Labs, highlighting the synergy between Puffer and LBank Labs’ scale across the market. “We are thrilled to have LBank Labs partnering with us at Puffer Finance. Their deep understanding of the liquid staking, combined with their keen industry insight, makes them an invaluable ally. This collaboration signals an exciting chapter of innovation and growth for us both."" LBank Labs aims to focus on its Platform Standard Ecosystem thesis and Puffer Finance stands out as an exceptional example of standard in the liquid staking space. One of the values that LBank Labs sees in its future portfolio companies is ‘how can this project change the industry standard’ “In that perspective, Puffer can contribute to bringing 100 million users to the crypto space with the mission to create universal and fair access to decentralized assets for billions of people” Nathalie, Principal Investor at LBank Labs said: ""We believe in the same vision that puffer sees in liquid staking. We look forward to working closely with Puffer to lower the barrier to entry for retail stakers and promote the decentralization on ETH staking."" Some of the other investors joining Puffer's latest round include Brevan Howard, Bankless Ventures, Animoca Ventures, and community funds such as 33DAO, WAGMI33, and Concave. Puffer Finance had previously raised $650K in a pre-seed round led by Jump Crypto in June 2022. Additionally, they received the Ethereum Foundation's Grant for developing a public good called Secure Signer, which has already been open-sourced for public use. About LBank Labs LBank Labs, a prominent player in the web3 space, manages a versatile $100 Million fund that extends beyond specific protocols and exchanges. With a team of experienced web3 veterans from prestigious entities, they have built an extensive network of expertise and connections. Their investment strategy includes fund-of-fund investments, direct investments in early-stage projects, and liquid projects, enabling them to explore diverse opportunities.

Instead of following the conventional practice of allocating a substantial amount of their coin supply for internal use, Rollbit opted for a different approach. This strategy exemplifies the crypto platform’s dedication to transparency and a distinct ideology pertaining to the allocation and application of its money. In the current market recovery, the RLB stands out as the frontrunner, exhibiting an unexpected and substantial surge. The token, regarded as the fundamental element of the Rollbit project, has experienced a notable surge in its valuation, prompting speculation regarding its prospective role in facilitating financial autonomy in the foreseeable future. Rollbit (RLB) On A Roll RLB price action in green. Source: Coingecko At the time of writing, RLB was flashing in green and trading at $0.17. The token has registered a 70% gain in the last 24 hours, sustaining an equally impressive 130% rally in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. Related Reading: Is Curve DAO (CRV) Price On Track To Reach Or Exceed $1 This Month? Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the alternative cryptocurrency has had a remarkable increase of more than 7,000% within the past year. Additionally, its value has skyrocketed by an astonishing 12,000% since its introduction to exchanges during the first half of 2022. Total crypto market cap at $1.14 trillion today. Chart: TradingView.com Rollbit Coin is a GameFi initiative that offers users the opportunity to engage in a variety of gaming activities. The aforementioned categories encompass casino games, sports-related activities, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform provides services such as NFT loans, leveraged trading, and crypto futures, among others. Rollbit has just undertaken the migration of RLB from the Solana blockchain to the Ethereum blockchain. This strategic decision was made in response to the increasing demand from users and with the aim of facilitating the token’s expansion and development opportunities. Rollbit’s objective with the migration was to improve the prospects for RLB holders and bolster the token’s market visibility. Rollbit seven-day price performance. Source: Coingecko Rollbit Coin has a trade volume above $39 million within a 24-hour period, signifying a notable surge of 62% in its price over the same duration. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency has experienced a substantial price escalation of 122% over the course of the previous week. Rollbit Coin, with a circulating quantity of 3.3 billion RLB, possesses a market capitalization of approximately $581 million. The significant increase in trading volume of the altcoin RLB may be attributed mostly to its listing on the main cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex. This surge in activity has occurred throughout the current week. RLB: Strong Upward Momentum Related Reading: Can Litecoin Bulls Turn The Tide On Recent Declines? A Closer Look While there is an argument to be made that RLB may be approaching overbought conditions, its momentum remains strong, indicating the likelihood of further upcoming rallies. The present condition suggests the possibility of excessive expansion, while the dominant pattern may contribute to additional upward shifts. The expansion of RLB is not a self-contained occurrence. This development is indicative of a larger pattern observed in the cryptocurrency sector, as several GambleFi initiatives have likewise demonstrated substantial expansion.

15818410,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546360,1691571333,"Ethereum: Historical Playbook Points To $3,800 In Coming Months","Renowned analyst Josh Olszewicz has shared some compelling insights on Ethereum’s price trajectory. Drawing parallels from historical patterns, Olszewicz’s analysis suggests that Ethereum might be gearing up for a significant rally in the coming months. Historical Pattern: Ethereum Forms Ascending Triangle Olszewicz starts by highlighting Ethereum’s current price pattern, jokingly stating, “Ethereum: ascending triangle 450 million years in the making w/fib extensions to $3k.” This ascending triangle, characterized by a flat top and rising bottom, has been forming since May 2022, and if history is any guide, it could be a bullish sign for Ethereum. Descending volume, another feature of this pattern, further strengthens the bullish bias. However, Olszewicz cautions that the “bias remains bullish until price breaks below diagonal support.” He also points out the psychological resistance at $2,000, noting it as an “extremely obvious signal that it’s go time, which should help the breakout.” Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF To bolster his analysis, Olszewicz draws parallels from Bitcoin’s past. He recalls, “take BTC in 2015/2016 [the price formed an ascending triangle for 210 days with descending volume] and BTC in 2018/2019 [ascending triangle for 130 days with descending volume] as examples.” In both instances, Bitcoin surged towards the Fibonacci extension levels post the breakout. Ethereum itself isn’t a stranger to such patterns. Olszewicz cites, “ETH has also had previous examples in 2017 (bullish continuation) and 2019 (bullish reversal).” Each ascending triangle pattern lasted 180 days. Both times ETH surged towards the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level. Drawing from these historical patterns, Olszewicz suggests that Ethereum is currently holding the potential to overshoot the 1.618 Fibonacci level and possibly reach the 2.618 level, which translates to a price of $3,800. However, he wisely advises, “but don’t get out the imaginary profit calculator just yet, let’s break $2k first.” ETH vs. BTC: Which One Is The Better Trade? While Ethereum’s potential rally is intriguing, Olszewicz also delves into its performance relative to Bitcoin. He observes that Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin year-to-date, attributing this to the ETF narrative and Bitcoin’s dominance as hard money. He speculates, “the better trade may continue to be BTC/USD, especially with initial spot ETF inflows favoring BTC.” Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Surging Today? However, if the ETH/BTC pair can break and sustain new highs, it might hint at a runaway trade for Ethereum. But Olszewicz remains skeptical, stating it’s “unlikely based on ETF flows.” Olszewicz also doesn’t shy away from discussing potential bearish scenarios. He’s closely watching certain bearish ETH/BTC levels, including the current local low at 0.050 and the previous inverse head and shoulders neckline at 0.039. For Bitcoin, he suggests a potential move to $42,000, provided it maintains certain bullish conditions. He notes, “as long as we can maintain prices above the midline of the PF & stay in the cloud, we have a decent shot at reaching $42k before halving.” Wrapping up his analysis, Olszewicz envisions a dream trade where Bitcoin breaks bullish first, possibly due to technicals or a spot ETF approval. In this scenario, Ethereum breaks $2,000 but lags behind Bitcoin, leading to ETH/BTC getting “crushed, allowing for an eventual profit taking rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum”. However, he concludes with a word of caution: “without inflows, we ain’t movin.” At press time, ETH traded at $1,860.

Building on its foundational strengths—dynamic gameplay, blockchain integration, and deep community engagement—MetaCene has wrapped up its immersive Alpha Test. A post-apocalyptic society, where survivors leverage diverse NFTs to craft a new civilization, emerged as the testing ground for innovative game dynamics and community-driven experiences. As players embarked on this journey from July 31st to August 7th, 2023, the gaming community awaited feedback and insights on this groundbreaking experience. Diving into the MetaCene Universe The Alpha Test's landscapes, namely the Origins of Clouds, Birdcry Town, and Sky Metropolis, unveiled a tapestry of lore, challenges, and technological wonders. Each zone, rich in narrative and design, presented players with unique opportunities for exploration, interaction, and accomplishment. The Origins of Clouds, for instance, offered a visually stunning entry into MetaCene’s universe, while Sky Metropolis stood as a beacon of future digital societies. Participants were met with a potent blend of Player vs. Environment (PVE) and PVP interactions as prominent features during the Alpha phase. The test emphasized the weight of each player's choices and their ripple effect throughout the game's evolving universe. The DAO-governed guilds epitomized this player agency, granting participants a direct hand in shaping the game's trajectory. Feedback from Industry Leaders The reviews are in and the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. Here is how some leading guilds and players described their experience: “Playing this game MetaCene gives me a nostalgic feeling!

USDT Transactions: There was an impressive 6,166 USDT transactions, accompanied by the creation of 1,225 new addresses.

The following are all the types of in-game utilization that were available during the test: Store usage Trading tax Off-chain action Guild creation Skill upgrade Weapon enhancement Warehouse unlock Backpack spots acquisition Weapon refinement Jail bribery Resurrection Warehouse storage Total consumption stood at 17,147,819 MUD. Such extensive and varied usage of the MUD token underscores the game's multifaceted strengths and intrinsic value and adaptability of the in-game currency. It paints a vivid picture of a thriving virtual economy, highlighting both the allure of the game and the tangible utility of its digital assets. Alan Tan, the game creator, shared “MetaCene's Alpha Test was a pivotal moment in our journey to re-imagine the MMORPG universe through blockchain.

The ratio surged to 1.36 on Aug. 1 on Bybit, reaching its highest level in at least a year, according to data tracked by South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. Values above 1 indicate that takers' buy volume is outpacing the sell volume, a sign of bullish trading in the market. Bybit is the world's third-largest crypto perpetual futures exchange in open interest and trading volume.  The ratio hit a three-and-a-half-month high of 1.17 on crypto exchange BitMEX on Tuesday and a six-month high of 1.31 on OKX, another trading platform, on July 30.  The taker buy-sell ratio is the ratio of buy volume divided by the sell volume of takers in perpetual swap markets. Perpetual swaps are futures-like derivative contracts with no expiration date, allowing traders to speculate on the value of the underlying asset.  Market takers are entities that put orders to buy or sell securities immediately, taking out liquidity from the order book. Trading firms and individual investors fall into the category of takers. Meanwhile, entities in the business of creating order book liquidity are market makers.  The data explains the recent bear failure to keep bitcoin below $29,000.  Since July, bitcoin has chalked out multiple daily candles with long lower wicks, indicating brief periods of sub-$29,000 trading. Prices jumped over 2% on Tuesday, topping the $30,000 mark.  According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, a spike in taker buy-sell ratio on low-volume exchanges like BitMEX is often a sign of increased buying by whales or large investors.

Market makers — or trading participants who fill buy and sell orders — were able to “fill the limit order and choose whether to return the additional slippage amount or retain the difference at their discretion,” developers said in a Wednesday tweet.  In trading, slippage refers to a market participant receiving a different trade execution price than intended due to factors such as available liquidity. On DEXs, users can manually set a slippage level they are comfortable with.  However, MuesliSwap users have been setting – and thus paying – high slippage for at least a year due to the way the decentralized matchmaker was set up.  The custom slippage was intended to be an incentive for decentralized matchmakers but ultimately caused “some misunderstanding among new users.”  “To make amends, we will be refunding affected users who encountered high slippage on the MuesliSwap pools in the last 12 months from our project funds,” developers said. “Additionally, immediate action has been taken to remedy the slippage issue in the MuesliSwap order book”  The refund process may take up to four weeks and funds will be automatically distributed by analyzing a user’s on-chain trading history.  MuesliSwap locks over $10 million worth of various tokens and is among the most-used platforms on the Cardano network.

Leading the charge among altcoins are PEPE with an 8% gain, followed closely by SHIB and HBAR both at 6.3%, TON at 5.6%, SNX at 5.4%, and SOL at 5.3%. The overall crypto market capitalization has swelled to $1.18 trillion(+1.63%), while Bitcoin’s dominance in the market has edged up to 50.63%. Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today? The market’s euphoria was initially triggered by a news piece which was shared by Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. He conveyed that insider sources from BlackRock and Invesco suggest that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF is more a question of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’, likely materializing within the next four to six months. The source for this information was Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz who made these revelations during a recent earnings call. This news, hinting at the imminent approval of a Bitcoin ETF, sent ripples across the Bitcoin and crypto community, igniting optimism and speculation. Following the news, whale activity has also been a notable driver behind the surge. Related Reading: Record-Breaking $10 Billion Open Interest Fuels Bullish Speculation For Bitcoin Reversal Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, tweeted: “Bitcoin whales opened giga long positions at $29k.” He also shared screenshots of the taker buy sell ratio on BitMEX, ByBit, Deribit and Huobi Global. Each chart shows an extremely high and sudden jump in buying volume, presumably from whales, as Ju said. Ali Martinez, a renowned analyst, chimed in on the significance of open interest. He pointed out that the Open Interest, which represents the total number of open long and short positions across all crypto derivative exchanges, has reached a remarkable year-to-date peak of $10.086 billion. This metric is particularly noteworthy given its historically strong correlation with Bitcoin’s price. The recent dip in Bitcoin to $28,700 seems to have presented an opportune moment for traders to adopt a bullish stance, suggesting that Bitcoin’s price might be poised for an upward trajectory Related Reading: ARK Invest’s CEO Says SEC Could Approve Multiple Spot Bitcoin ETFs Simultaneously Julio Moreno, from CryptoQuant, noted a sharp rise in Coinbase’s premium, indicating strengthening Bitcoin demand in the US. This observation aligns with the narrowing discount of GBTC, which many see as a proxy of Grayscale’s potential success against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its lawsuit for a spot ETF, but also as an indicator of the likelihood of a Bitcoin Spot ETF being approved. The GBTC discount fell to -27% yesterday. From a technical market perspective, the euphoria in the market has led to a short squeeze. A total of $37.19 million was liquidated in BTC shorts yesterday, $65.46 million in the overall crypto market. The short liquidations for Bitcoin were the highest since July 13 when the price rose to its yearly high at $31,820. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that while short-sellers were gradually liquidated while there was a premium on spot markets and funding rates on futures markets were falling. This means that the rise move was primarily driven via the spot markets rather than over-leveraged long positions. Remarkably, whales played a key role. At press time, the Bitcoin price faced critical resistance between $29,900 and $30,000.

Going by the moniker “GCR,” on-chain data on August 8 showed the trader moved 450,000 MOON from MEXC Exchange to Kraken. Moons Rallying Moons, the ERC-20 token associated with the r/CryptoCurrency forum on Reddit, is firm and on an uptrend, looking at current price action. At spot rates, the token is up 400% from late July and changing hands at $0.47, hovering near 2023 highs. Related Reading: HBAR Token Scores Impressive Gains As Major Cryptos Nosedive Based on price action from MEXC trade data, the immediate resistance level is at $0.65, which was printed in late July 2023. However, with the revival currently visible across the crypto market, prices will likely continue increasing. To illustrate, Moons is already up 90% in August alone, rebounding from $0.25 and surging to spot rates. Several factors are believed to be fanning demand. One of these is the influence of traders like GCR, who are acquiring Moons and potentially improving sentiment on altcoins considering the recent lower lows recorded in the better part of July. However, looking at how MOON prices reacted after Kraken’s listing on August 7, the community appears more buoyant and confident of improving liquidity. Kraken Listing As trackers reveal, before the Kraken listing, most Moons trading activity was concentrated on MEXC Exchange. On August 7, Kraken announced its listing of Moons alongside Bricks (BRICK). Alongside the announcement, Kraken said users could deposit MOON and BRICK from the Arbitrum Nova network. Moons and Bricks are also available for trading on Kraken and Kraken Pro accounts. From Kraken Pro, clients can trade MOON and BRICK perpetual derivatives. MOON has been described as a “community-driven” token since its launch in May 2020. Within the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit, it serves multiple functions, including rewarding users who contribute positively. Reddit said Moons’ holders can access premium features, including badges and custom emojis, and tip fellow community members. Moreover, holding Moons grants voting power in subreddit polls, affording holders a say in shaping the subreddit’s future.

15809910,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546306,1691553655,Record-Breaking $10 Billion Open Interest Fuels Bullish Speculation For Bitcoin Reversal,"The cryptocurrency market has experienced a period of stagnation, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading within a narrow range for the past week. However, according to market analyst Ali Martinez, there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon as Open Interest, a key indicator of market sentiment, has skyrocketed to a year-to-date high. Correlation Between Open Interest And Bitcoin Notably, the correlation between Open Interest and Bitcoin’s price has historically been significant, suggesting that this surge may herald a potential reversal in the leading cryptocurrency’s fortunes. Martinez believes the recent dip to $28,700 prompted crypto traders to take long positions, fueling optimism for a Bitcoin resurgence. Over the past week, the overall crypto market has experienced a period of stagnation, with Bitcoin trading within a tight range of $28,900 to $29,200. This consolidation follows a continuous decline from its yearly high of $31,800, which has also set the tone for other major cryptocurrencies. The lack of significant price movement has left investors and traders eager for a catalyst that could propel the market forward. Related Reading: Is Curve DAO (CRV) Price On Track To Reach Or Exceed $1 This Month? Nevertheless, the number of open long and short positions on crypto derivative exchanges has surged to a remarkable year-to-date high of $10.086 billion. This surge in Open Interest is significant, indicating heightened market activity and trader engagement. One crucial aspect to consider is the historical correlation between Open Interest and the price of Bitcoin. This relationship has often been strong, with Open Interest as a leading indicator for potential price movements. As Open Interest reaches new highs, it suggests that market participants are actively taking positions in anticipation of a significant market shift. While the crypto market has been characterized by stagnation and decline in recent times, the surge in Open Interest to a yearly high provides hope for a bullish reversal. Bearish Divergence Signals Potential Pullback For BTC Bitcoin has recently exhibited some intriguing patterns that warrant attention from both technical analysis and on-chain analysis perspectives. According to Baro Virtual, CryptoQuant author and analyst, a bearish divergence on the BTC Average Return Index suggests a possible pullback to $26,000. Simultaneously, on-chain analysis indicates a weakening return index performance alongside a rising Bitcoin price, potentially signaling a phase of re-accumulation that may benefit investors seeking lower prices. The transition of the return index into the negative zone suggests a shift in market sentiment towards re-accumulation. Related Reading: Terra Luna Token Burn Proposal Greenlit – Could $1 Be Hittable? Re-accumulation typically occurs when long-term investors or institutions acquire Bitcoin at lower prices, anticipating future price appreciation. This behavior can be seen as a positive sign for the market’s long-term health, reflecting increased interest from strategic investors. As of the current update, BTC has broken out of its range which has persisted since the beginning of August. It is trading at $29,600, reflecting a 2.5% increase over the past 24 hours. However, the upward price movement of BTC in the short term may not be sustained unless accompanied by substantial trading volume. Several significant resistance levels lie ahead, posing challenges for BTC’s attempt to reclaim the $30,000 milestone. To begin with, the $29,700 zone presents a formidable barrier, followed by subsequent resistance walls at $30,000, $30,700, $31,200, and $31,500. In the short and mid-term, BTC, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, will need a compelling catalyst to push beyond these levels. Without such, a retracement is possible in the coming weeks.

This allowed the bears to gain dominance. However, there appears to be a change in price sentiment during recent trading sessions. Related Reading: Terra Luna Token Burn Proposal Greenlit – Could $1 Be Hittable? On the daily chart, ETH experienced a 2% climb. A positive movement is observable on the weekly chart, although it remains relatively modest. Despite the upward movement, there is a potential risk of waning bullish momentum if Ethereum fails to sustain its price above the immediate trading zone. From a technical standpoint, the altcoin is leaning toward bullishness, with increased buying strength apparent in recent trading sessions. Both accumulation and demand have played a role in this positive shift. Furthermore, Ethereum’s market capitalization has grown, indicating heightened demand during the past trading sessions. At the time of writing, ETH was priced at $1,840. It is currently nearing its immediate resistance level of $1,850, which has previously functioned as a liquidity pocket. Approaching this level might trigger a price decrease. However, if the altcoin successfully surpasses $1,850 and establishes a trading position above the subsequent resistance at $1,870, it could signal a more prolonged period of bullish activity. On the flip side, the support level is $1,780, followed by another at $1,760. Falling within this range might lead to further downward movement in the price. The trading volume of ETH in the previous session was lower. However, the fact that it was in the green indicates that buyers were gradually entering the market. Technical Analysis Regarding buyer activity, there has been increased demand for the altcoin following a notable dip within the past 48 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) climbed above the 60 mark, suggesting a revival for the altcoin and signaling buyer engagement surpassed seller activity. Furthermore, the price remained above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that buyers were the driving force behind the market’s price momentum. Another observation is that ETH remained above the 200-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line (green). This suggests a substantial price surge could be anticipated before the bullish momentum wanes. Correlating with the increase in demand, ETH exhibited buy signals on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which signifies price momentum and potential shifts, showed green histograms aligned with buy signals. These buy signals also suggest a potential upward movement in the price over the subsequent immediate trading sessions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Show Accumulation Again, Bullish Sign? Additionally, the Bollinger Bands appeared wide from each other, indicating the likelihood of price volatility, although not overly significant as the bands mainly remained parallel.

Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has recorded similar profits while the rest of the market stalls or sees losses. Key resistance stands at around $30,000, but BTC failed to breach it on every recent occasion. Bitcoin Price Prepares… For Monotony? Over the past two years, the Bitcoin price has been moving in tandem with macroeconomic forces. In particular, BTC reacts to the tension from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) and its interest rates hike program. The financial institution is entering a quiet period due to summer vacations. As a result, according to crypto analysis firm Blofin, Bitcoin and the crypto market will likely stay within their current range until September. Over this period, price movements and volatility spikes will continue to decline as the low liquidity environment impacts price action, and institutions hedging their positions impact volatility, Blofin stated. Furthermore, the report claims that potential interest rate hikes are “somewhat priced in” and could be inefficient in propelling BTC above $30,000. The current macroeconomic landscape could persist until May 2023 as inflation, the key reason behind the interest rates hike, becomes sticky. The above could translate into sideways price action until that period or until the U.S. Fed decides to cut interest rates paving the way for more risk appetite across the sector. Blofin stated: (…) investors seem to have become accustomed to daily life at high interest rates. The lack of liquidity has left investors with little interest in “trading”. Most investors are sitting on the sidelines. Bitcoin Investors Brace For Impact The chart below shows monthly trading volume across crypto exchanges has declined since July 2022. The report stated that this status quo reflects investors’ lack of interest in crypto, with BTC recording intraday price movements of around 0.1%, a first for the cryptocurrency in such an extended period.

In that sense, the crypto research firm believes that, due to the lack of strength around BTC and ETH, prices are likely to see a dip: (…) it is not difficult to find that when the price of BTC is around $30,000, and the price of ETH is around $2,000, both will lose further upward momentum here, hovering for a while, and then fall.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Regulatory clarity is required for bitcoin to push past $30,000.  Insights: Where is the utility in Web3?  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC) is beginning the Asia trading day at $29,786, up 2% on-day, while ether (ETH) is trading at $1,855, up 1.3%.  Bitcoin’s volatility continues to be at a record low, Vivien Fang, head of trading products at Bybit, said in a note to CoinDesk, suggesting an eventual rebound.  “Our attention is on catalysts toward year-end, potentially linked to ETF narratives or industry-transforming events,” she said. “The alignment between speculative strategies and these kinds of pivotal events could combine to form significant tailwinds for the crypto market.”  The 30k mark is a critical threshold, with consensus indicating 40k as the next significant level, Fang explained. However, there remains a high potential for a volatility surge due to macro-related downside events that could unexpectedly impact the market.  Despite bitcoin’s low volatility, it’s still outperformed crypto hedge funds, according to a report from 21e6 Capital.  “It is plain to see that a simple buy-and-hold investment into bitcoin would have outperformed all of these fund baskets. Bitcoin added about 80% in value by the half of the year,” 21e6 Capital due diligence manager Jan Spörer and sales and marketing head Maximilian Bruckner wrote in the report. “In previous bull runs, crypto hedge funds were frequently able to significantly outperform the bitcoin benchmark.”  Data from CryptoRank.io shows that the price of bitcoin and the amount of money invested in crypto startups have historically been correlated, their analyst team wrote in a note to CoinDesk.  In 2022, both were on the decline. However, despite the significant growth of bitcoin in 2023, the monthly amount raised is low compared to 2021-2022.  The question continues to be: what will cause the next breakout? And what if it's not the long-awaited bitcoin ETF?

42419780,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUFr6j,1691544682,Coinbase Exec: ‘There’s No Playbook’ for Public Company Launching Blockchain,"Coinbase expects to get more revenue from decentralized applications or “dapps” that build atop Base than from the blockchain itself.  Coinbase has participated in discussions among developers over future upgrades for the Ethereum blockchain.  Coinbase aims to provide a “trusted interface, curated experiences” to people who previously have not spent a lot of time working with blockchains.  Coinbase ($COIN), the big publicly traded U.S. crypto exchange, is preparing for the launch of its new Base blockchain on Wednesday, expected around noon ET (9 am Pacific time).  The new network, technically a “layer 2” blockchain built atop Ethereum, is expected to immediately vault into the top ranks of rival projects.  Even prior to its official public debut, there was already $133 million of deposits locked into apps and protocols on the new Base network, according to the crypto analysis firm L2Beat. That amount of “total value locked” or TVL – a common metric for evaluating blockchains and protocols – is enough to rank Base as the fifth-biggest layer-2 blockchain.  On Tuesday, CoinDesk had a zoom conversation with Jesse Pollak, creator of Base and head of protocols at Coinbase, about the new blockchain's strategy, revenue potential and regulatory considerations.  A key point that Pollak emphasized: No publicly traded company has ever launched its own blockchain, so “there’s no playbook” for how to go about it.  The following Q&A has been edited for clarity and brevity.  CoinDesk: What does Coinbase get out of this initiative?  Pollak: Coinbase was started in 2012, before Ethereum, before smart contracts. It was really just a place to buy and sell bitcoin. And then over the last decade, it's expanded, you know, adding more currencies, made it so you couldn’t just buy and sell, you could also save, you could stake, you borrow, you could lend. I think the kind of guiding North Star for Coinbase has been like, How do we enable people to safely and easily do things with crypto? That's it. And I think historically that the aperture of what people can do with crypto has been relatively limited, right? It's been mostly speculation, and mostly trading. And so that's where Coinbase has focused most of the energy. That said, if you look at the “secret master plan” that [CEO] Brian [Armstrong] wrote in 2016, I think the vision has been, you know, a billion people in the crypto economy using millions of dapps that make their lives better.  And I think we kind of see the progression over the last decade as working through the first three phases of what we consider our master plan, which was like, build the protocols Bitcoin Ethereum, build the exchange so people get money into those protocols, build the consumer interface, and so people can start using those protocols. But we've kind of gotten stuck on phase four, like we don't have millions and billions. That's just not where we are as an industry. And so what's in it for Coinbase is we think we have to get there in order for Coinbase and crypto and this work that we're doing to have the impact that we all want. We need to move from the place where this is speculation to a place where this is integrated into every part of someone's day-to-day existence, and giving them a better platform to live their lives, across every part of the world that they interact with. And so we really see Base as the platform that's gonna enable that next wave of innovation. You know, it's low cost, it’s easy to use, it's built for developers, it's decentralized, it's connected into Ethereum, which is obviously like the largest kind of decentralized ecosystem in the world, from a crypto perspective, and it's Coinbase’s commitment, and it is our kind of investment in enabling that next wave of utility and innovation in crypto. And so when we think about Coinbase coming on-chain, really what we're saying is we're gonna see an incredible wave of blockchain innovation over the next five years, over the upcoming decade, where millions of incredibly useful products are going to be built. And some of those are going to be overlapping with existing products. Some of them are gonna be novel and new, and things that we create, and Coinbase is going to continue being the easiest, most trusted place for people to access those products.  CoinDesk: And so the revenue opportunity, does that come from the chain or does that come from the apps?  Pollak: We really think it comes from the apps. Base is an investment in innovation, not to earn a bunch of profits. I'd say Coinbase has always monetized by taking complex crypto things and then making them easy to do and charging a fee for that. And as the number of things that you can do with crypto increases, our bet is that that's going to be great for Coinbase, because the number of things that customers use Coinbase interfaces to access will increase, and there'll be an opportunity for us to monetize.  CoinDesk: And so the revenue wouldn’t primarily come from running the sequencer of the blockchain? (Armstrong told Wall Street analysts last week that “Base will be monetized through what are called sequencer fees.”)  Pollak: Generally, sequencer fees, we expect to not be the primary focus from a revenue perspective for the product. What we're really focused on is increasing utility, which increases the number of use cases that folks can do through Coinbase and increases the opportunity for Coinbase to provide easy-to-use, trusted experiences that we can monetize. We're not running the sequencer to make a bunch of profit. We're running the sequencer to enable innovation. And we're gonna be reinvesting that money in innovation. And we're going to be focusing monetization efforts where we've always monetized, which is the user experience.  CoinDesk: You're the centralized, retail-focused company. How do you communicate to retail investors when it comes to these sorts of, you know, possibilities of rug pools and so on? Or what we saw with the BALD token on Base after you opened it to developers.  Pollak: Historically, we've always done a good job communicating to folks about the risks and kind of like, where they should be focusing their attention, and providing kind of curated and trusted experiences for them. And that's not going to change. I think one thing that we've been clear about, kind of from the beginning, when we started creating Base, is that Base is going to be open and permissionless. It is an extension of Ethereum. It’s a layer 2 that scales Ethereum but preserves the open, permissionless nature of it. And what that means is that Base is, you know, it's crypto. Did I plan for that BALD stuff to happen the week before we were starting to open up Base? Absolutely not. But it was kind of a reminder for me that in crypto, you can make plans, but because these systems are open and permissionless, sometimes your plans change, and folks kind of bubble up in the way that, you know, crypto has always bubbled up over the last decade in ways that are unexpected. And so I think what we're really focused on is twofold. One is ensuring that Base remains open and permissionless so that we can have a decentralized and global on-chain economy because ultimately that's what we believe is like the single most important thing we can contribute to the world. And that decentralization and the open permissionless nature of Base is what enables that global economy. So that's the first thing and I think on the Coinbase side, what we're really focused on is continuing to provide that kind of easiest-to-use, most-trusted experience on top of Base.  And so I think what you'll see is that for folks who are kind of more comfortable just getting in there and you know, living at the edge and doing their own research, they'll find ways to use Base. But for most people, they'll access Base through Coinbase, and Coinbase will continue providing a trusted interface, curated experiences. We have our ratings and reviews, which rates dapps, it rates tokens, it helps people understand what they are, what the risks are. We're going to continue having what I would consider, like almost first party products that build on top of protocols on Base. So for instance, you know, the DEX swap functionality and Coinbase wallet or in Coinbase Web3 tab, the borrow functionality, Coinbase wallet, where we really say hey, these protocols are trusted. We're going to expose them through dedicated user interfaces. And I think that role that Coinbase can play is going to be that kind of gateway, where we make sure that the things that are getting in front of everyday folks are safe and trusted, while still enabling banks to have that open, permissionless characteristic that enables all the creativity that we want to see in the world.  CoinDesk: I wonder if you can say definitively there will never be a token on base, or is this something that you've talked about and are still talking about internally?  Pollak: Yeah, we have no plans to have a token on base or token for base. I guess there's lots of tokens on Base, right? Ethereum is the native asset of base, there's USDC and there's all sorts of tokens that are deployed on Base and folks are building a whole rich economy on Base. We looked at the regulatory environment and we looked at the impact of having tokens and products. I think our general perspective is like, they're more confusing for finding product market fit than helpful. What we're really focused on is ensuring and building a developer platform that makes it really easy for developers to build dapps and in building a chain that makes it really easy for users to use them. That's it.  And I think if you look at the last five years, there's a lot of noise that's basically been created by tokens, where the incentives for developers and the incentives for users have been perverted. And rather than saying, Hey, we're using this thing, because it's the best product, it's no, we're using the same because we got X million-dollar grant or we got paid Y dollars for every action. And so I think we kind of wanted to say, Hey, let's just not.  CoinDesk: In terms of launching your own blockchain, did you have to check with your general counsel or regulatory lawyers to make sure you’d have zero risk from a regulatory standpoint?  Pollak: We checked. Launching a decentralized open permissionless blockchain out of a public centralized company, no one's done that before. Like, there's no playbook. And we've applied all of the Coinbase rigor to doing this over the last year, which includes working with literally every single part of the company, from legal to compliance, to finance to privacy, to regulatory, to ensure that we're doing it to the Coinbase values, which is to be deliberate, to be thoughtful, to be measured, to be secure, to be trusted. And so at every turn, we have really gone above and beyond to make sure that we're doing this in the right way.  CoinDesk: So there’s nothing from a regulatory standpoint, that would be like, Yeah, you're not allowed to launch a blockchain?  Pollak: I think our feeling is that currently the regulatory environment in the many countries around the world is way more unclear than should be. And if you talk to entrepreneurs who are building on Base or building anywhere, what you'll hear is that they're spending more money on counsel and, you know, like defensive measures from a regulatory perspective than they are on hiring engineers, building products. And so we've been really consistent at Coinbase, that we think that needs to change. And we think that we need to bring clarity that can encourage and enable innovation and can protect consumers and make sure they're getting the best out of this incredible new technology.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/09/coinbase-exec-theres-no-playbook-for-public-company-launching-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c3a617bb5b8112ca162a69ad55a89e9ecb26d3f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the city’s chief regulatory agency, some cryptocurrency trading platforms have been making erroneous claims about meeting the regulatory requirements for digital assets. Investors Beware Of False Claims From Crypto Firms The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the chief regulatory body of Hong Kong, released the alert on August 7. In the statement, the commission noted that some unlicensed exchanges in the city were engaging in “improper practices.” Related Reading: Valkyrie Unveils Double-Barreled Approach To Launch An Ethereum ETF Alongside A Bitcoin ETF According to the body, unlicensed Virtual Assets Trading Platforms (VATPs) are falsely claiming to have submitted license applications to the body, which would enable them to conduct transactions legally in the special administrative region of China. Such fraudulent claims were designed to “give the public a false sense of assurance” and were targeted at “inducing another person to trade in virtual assets.” Making such claims amounts to a punishable offense under the city’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Finance Ordinance, the regulatory body said. Furthermore, the SFC will consider any likely misrepresentation made by an unlicensed Virtual Asset Trading Platform when deciding whether or not to grant them a license. The SFC may view as unfavorable any non-compliant actions that would need the reversion of client withdrawal or transactions that could have been reasonably avoided. The Securities and Futures Commission said it will evaluate a Virtual Asset Trading Platform’s application based on its ability to show genuine intention to correct previous non-compliant actions, including the gradual unwinding of impermissible transactions. Virtual Assets Trading Platforms that do not meet the agency’s requirements must make efforts to meet the regulatory and legal obligations of licensed VAPTs, the SFC clarified. Total market cap recovers to $1.133 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Hong Kong’s Regulatory Framework Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) recently released guidelines for Virtual Asset Trading Platform operators in the country to provide more regulatory certainty for the crypto industry in the country and help protect investors’ interests. The SFC laid down rules that would enable centralized exchanges to provide services to retail clients, provided they are authorized by a license obtained from the Securities and Futures Commission. Under Hong Kong’s VASP regime, which kickstarted on June 1, 2023, a one-year grace period commencing from June 1, 2023, allowed exchanges with an existing large presence in the city to continue operations while making changes to their businesses to ensure compliance with the new SFCs rules. Related Reading: PayPal’s PYUSD Launch Triggers Calls For Stablecoin Bill Platform operators that had not commenced operations before June 1, 2023, had to be SFC-licensed before they could operate. However, it seems that certain exchanges are already violating the rules provided under the new regime. According to SFC, investors participating in trading on unregulated virtual asset exchanges are likely to face “losing their entire investment” on the exchange if it “ceases operation, collapses, is hacked,” or “suffers from any misappropriation of assets.” Following this, many exchanges have publicly pledged to submit licensing applications with the SFC, including Huobi and OKX, two popular exchanges in Asia.

With a significant deadline for ARK’s application looming on August 13, amidst speculation of potential delays, Wood suggested that the deadline might pass and be extended but then the date will be eagerly waited on.
