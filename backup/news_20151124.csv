42378408,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i8wv,1448397656,Bitcoin Startups Face Backlash for Perceived Pivots,"Bitcoin industry startups are facing backlash over a new series of articles in which they have been portrayed as pivoting away from the digital currency and toward more general FinTech applications.  Spurred by articles in Business Insider and The Guardian that accused companies including BitPay, Circle and Uphold (formerly Bitreserve) of ""turning their back"" on the technology, social media forums became venues for an airing of community grievances over the more inflammatory language used by the publications this week.  ""Bitreserve, which used to be a bitcoin wallet and exchange, has rebranded itself as 'Uphold', and is now firmly trying to shove its history down the memory hole,"" The Guardian wrote.  At issue for many was whether the news publications were overenthusiastic in their characterization of the industry trend, or whether the companies with formerly bitcoin-centric business models are saying one thing to the press and another to the community.  Reddit user Eragmus took issue with the duality of statements by Uphold CEO Anthony Watson, writing:  ""This company is completely two-faced.""  Elsewhere, technology enthusiasts called the company ""hypocrites"" for statements that implied the ""Bit"" in its former name did not refer to bitcoin. Prior to this week, bitcoin had been the sole payment method available in the US to send funds in and out of the platform.  Also caught up in the crossfire were BitPay and Circle, which were accused of abandoning their bitcoin products and ""falling back"" on the blockchain in order to acquire new users by Business Insider.  Such wordings often confused the dualistic nature of the bitcoin blockchain, which requires the use of the bitcoin currency to function as a global payments rail. However, they did successfully highlight how many of the digital currency's users feel it is the responsibility of industry startups to introduce the technology to mainstream users.  Stance clarified  In statements following the news, Uphold was adamant that it was misrepresented in being characterized as moving away from bitcoin.  Anthony Watson, the CEO of Uphold – formerly known as Bitreserve – took to Twitter to defend his company's bitcoin strategy, telling his followers that the firm was not intending to pivot away from the digital currency.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Watson added:    ""First, Uphold has been independently verified as the cheapest place to buy bitcoin in the world. Contrary to the recent coverage, Uphold is not 'moving away from bitcoin.' We do and will continue to support the digital currency; it is one of the many currencies and commodities we support.""            Speculation about Uphold's relationship with bitcoin, however, has been rife ever since the company announced its rebranding last month.  Speaking to CoinDesk at the time, Watson denied that the firm was moving away from bitcoin, instead framing the re-branding as a response to customer demand for additional services.  Circle speaks out  Watson's firm, however, is not the only company in the space facing rumours about its potential abandonment of the digital currency.  Jeremy Allaire, founder and CEO of Circle Internet Financial, also took to Twitter to explain his company's business strategy toward bitcoin, directly addressing the Business Insider article:    @OscarWGrut Not an accurate view of .@circlepay strategy, but the more companies who use bitcoin ""under the hood"", the more bitcoin succeeds — Jeremy Allaire (@jerallaire) November 22, 2015          Bitcoin payment processor BitPay – which laid off staff in a ""cost-cutting"" exercise in September – was also mentioned in media reports for its perceived distancing from the digital currency.  The processor defended its strategy on Twitter, noting that it was still supportive of the original bitcoin vision, which envisaged the creation of a peer-to-peer payment system.  ""We believe in that vision,"" said the company on Twitter.  Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk's founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42378412,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i93D,1448391910,Post-Trade Tech Firm Seeks to Build Commodities Blockchain Consortium,"Post-trade technology services firm Kynetix is seeking to assemble a consortium of commodities market stakeholders to explore the collaborative use of blockchain technology.  Kynetix  announced today that it has so far assembled a ""coalition of 15 commodity exchanges, investment banks, clearing houses and brokers"", though it declined to name those involved in the effort.  Despite this silence, however, Kynetix is seeking to liken the project to similar efforts by distributed ledger startup R3, which has united 30 brand-name banks in a similar initiative.  In interview, Guillaume Kendall, head of business development at the UK-based company, sought to characterize its service as uniquely positioned between the ""physical economy and the financial markets"", thus making it an ideal candidate to lead the conversation.  Kendall told CoinDesk:  ""Our software is focused on the post-trade elements of the commodity trade lifecycle – specifically solving industry challenges for settlement, physical delivery, inventory, warranting and title transfer. It is on these last two points that we identified a potential use case for blockchain technology among others.""  Kendall said the goal of the consortium will be to investigate the benefits blockchain technology could bring to this process, and to explore the subject with ""key actors"" who could work on a collaborative solution.  He framed the effort as complementary to R3, positioning the comparison as an acknowledgement of that group's ""significant momentum"" in bringing together traditional financial stakeholders.  When reached for comment, Kynetix’s public-facing partners including London Metals Exchange, Stonehage and UBS declined to comment as to their involvement in the initiative. InterContinental Exchange (ICE) indicated it was not involved in the project.  Kynetix said the first meeting of the consortium will be held tomorrow, 25th November, in London.

42378405,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i8yB,1448384416,Vote for 2015's Most Influential People in Bitcoin and Blockchain,"Update: Please note: the poll has now closed.  The narrative surrounding cryptocurrencies has changed in 2015, and so has the language.  We no longer just talk about 'bitcoin', but use that other b-word: 'blockchain'. Institutional interest in bitcoin and blockchains has surged. Banks, exchanges and financial services firms are major players now.  Last year, we asked you to vote for the 10 most influential people in the bitcoin industry – and you gave us this list. It included venture capitalists, a regulator, a bitcoin evangelist, a technologist then still brewing his big project, the twin figures behind Silk Road and the man behind Mt Gox.  For 2015, our list of suggested nominees has similarly expanded.  Included are representatives from brand-name financial services firms, disruptive startups and government organizations (as well as a few major mining firms) who we think impacted the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem the most in the last 12 months.  But we're also inviting you to nominate anyone else who you believe has left an indelible mark on the blockchain terrain this year.  We'll run this poll for two to three weeks, collate the 10 names with the most votes and then publish the results in mid-December.  Update: Thank you for voting. We are now consolidating the data which will assist with informing our list.
