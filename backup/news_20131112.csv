42376683,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6beOR,1384291842,Winklevoss twins: bitcoin could hit market cap of $400 Billion,"The Winklevoss brothers are incredibly bullish on bitcoin, saying recently that its market cap could reach 100 times higher than it is right now.  The twins, who are major investors in bitcoin after becoming wealthy from an early partnership with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, told CNBC at the Dealbook conference in New York that a $400bn market cap for BTC would be a ""small bull case scenario"".  By some calculations, bitcoin may be worth more than the money in circulation in some countries, although that doesn't take into account other economic factors such as GDP.  Also, countries regulate their currencies. With bitcoin, however, there are no guarantees since it is not backed by any state authority. This has made the virtual currency relatively risky, as scams and fraud have been prevalent. Nevertheless, the Winklevoss twins still believe that there will be favorable regulation regarding it.  ""I think everyone recognizes the innovation and doesn't want to stifle it. They just want to make sure there's healthy regulations so it's used in a safe and productive manner,"" said Cameron Winklevoss.  The Winklevoss twins have a vested interest in bitcoin's growing popularity, as is obvious by their reported investment of somewhere in the neighborhood of 108,000 BTC, according to Business Insider. That would be worth around $37M at a recent CoinDesk BPI valuation.  But they also want to bring bitcoin to the masses through an exchange-traded fund. The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust filed for a $20m IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in July. No date for the offering has been set.  The twins believe that even though bitcoin can be used for criminal activity, such as for black marketplaces like Silk Road, there is a lot of very legitimate demand for it as well.  ""Prices are double what they were before Silk Road was shut down. So the demand to use bitcoin for illicit activity was clearly almost zero,"" said Tyler Winklevoss.  The twins believe that bitcoin has some similar values to gold, an asset that many investors buy because they lack faith in the US dollar.  ""Some people definitely view it as Gold 2.0,"" Tyler Winklevoss told CNBC.

42376685,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6beQx,1384275423,"Czech bitcoin exchange Bitcash.cz hacked and up to 4,000 user wallets emptied","Czech Republic-based bitcoin exchange Bitcash.cz has been hacked and up to 4,000 customers’ wallets have been emptied.  The company’s site is currently down, showing only a message informing of the hack, which took place on 11th November.  According to Czech news site E15.cz, some 4,000 bitcoin wallets had been opened with Bitcash.cz, with a total value of over 2 million Czech koruna (roughly equivalent to $100,000).  A post on the company's Facebook page reads (roughly translated):    ""Unfortunately, as we have already announced on our website Bitcash.cz, our server was attacked and compromised – including the wallets.      We are trying to resolve the situation, but we want to warn our users about fraudulent emails and scams [claiming to be from Bitcash].    We never ask anyone for access to his or her accounts or wallets nor ask for money.    We will inform you of any developments as soon as possible.    Thanks.""    Bitcash, founded in July 2011, has various features in addition to its wallets. It featured an online exchange that filled orders from traders, but also an OTC exchange, similar to LocalBitcoins.com, which enables people to trade with each other directly, using the site as an escrow service.  An online post purports to show an email sent from a bitcash.cz email address. The text in that mail suggests that the site may have been hacked using a phishing attack that used fraudulent emails to fool users. Hackers appear to have sent emails from Bitcash.cz email accounts pretending to be members of staff. The emails claim the company is having to use a US recovery company to get back the bitcoins that have been stolen.  Recipients are then apparently asked to send 2 BTC to a wallet address in order for their bitcoins to be returned. However the bitcoin address listed in the email text hasn’t been used online, and has no transactions.  Aleš Janda, a user of the Bitcash.cz service who claims to have known the administrator “a little”, is skeptical of the fake email claim. “This e-mail is strange,"" he said, adding that he knows no one else who received it. “I can't imagine that anyone who steals 485 BTC would take the risk of disclosure by sending dumb mails begging for 2 BTC.”  Janda arrived at this 485 BTC number via his own blockchain research. He has made several transactions to Bitcash.cz, which he says uses a shared wallet. These transactions enabled him to ascertain some of the addresses in the Bitcash.cz shared wallet, he says. He was then able to analyse transaction inputs and outputs to see where his bitcoins subsequently went. “Bitcash's wallet was pretty simple,” he said. “So I can trace all transactions [using a wallet subtree] from my transaction to some big transaction in the future. This big transaction perfectly matches the time of the attack and was much bigger than other transactions.”  He then confirmed this by analyzing other bitcoin transactions with Bitcash.cz, which he said led to a large transaction pointing to the same address. Searching for that address brings up a bitcoin charity web site called bitcoin-charity.info – now no longer available – which claims to be a donation address for whistle-blowing organization Wikileaks.  That supposed charity site, registered using a privacy protection service on 8th September, appears to be a fraudulent copy of legitimate bitcoin charity web site Bitcoins for Charity. Bitcoins for Charity cites the correct Wikileaks bitcoin donation address.  Janda suggests that wallets on Bitcash.cz were compromised through the site’s web interface. “Maybe the whole portal was compromised, but the wallets of all users were. It seems to me that wallets were compromised through the web interface - the attacker didn't have private keys.”  Calls and emails to 'Carlos', the owner of the site, who also owns Internet consultancy All High Seeds, went unanswered yesterday. However, a statement on the site suggested that it had filed charges against an “unknown perpetrator”.

42376675,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6beFd,1384260850,Online payment network Ripple Labs receives $3.5 Million in new funding,"Decentralised online payment network Ripple Labs has received a further $3.5m in funding.  This brings the total amount of funding raised by the company, formerly known as OpenCoin, to $9m.  Ripple Labs  , which enables people to make free and instant payments in any currency, including bitcoin, said it plans to use the new funds to continue the development of the Ripple ecosystem.  New investors in the company include Core Innovation Capital, Venture 51 and Camp One Ventures. Existing investor IDG Capital Partners has put more money into the company.  “Ripple removes friction from even the most basic of payment transactions, leveling the playing field for underserved individuals and emerging markets around the globe,” said Arjan Schütte, founder and managing partner of Core Innovation Capital.  [post-quote]  “We are investing in a veteran leadership team with a vision for using one of the most disruptive innovations in financial services to do good and empower individuals through financial inclusion,"" he added.  Ripple already has backing from Google Ventures and California-based VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, which has also invested in Skype, Twitter and Airbnb.  In order to activate their Ripple account users have to own small quantity of the company's own digital currency, known as XRP. Each user must then have a small Action Reserve of 12.5 XRP in their Ripple Wallet in order to make transactions.  Each transaction costs a very small fraction of XRP, a charge that is in place to prevent people from abusing the system.  One of Ripple's most attractive features is that users can send money in one currency and the recipient can receive it in another currency. This means a customer could pay for an item in bitcoins and the merchant could receive the payment in dollars.  “Similar to the way in which email and other technologies drove the creation of a new global information web where anyone can communicate instantly and for free, Ripple is changing the way the world transacts with the first global value web,” said Ripple Labs CEO Chris Larsen.  “Ripple powers instant, affordable and secure transactions in any currency, making it as easy to move money as it is to send an email,"" he concluded.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | XRP,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/12/online-payment-network-ripple-labs-receives-35-million-in-new-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e67c119109992304e399bd7790f8853236293995-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376671,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6beBr,1384259405,Bitcoin stock exchange BitFunder announces closure,"Yet another bitcoin stock exchange is about to bite the dust.  BitFunder has announced it is closing down.  The site, which launched in December 2012 and held around $16m in assets in July, will cease trading on 14th November and transfer out any leftover bitcoins held by users on 2nd December.  BitFunder owner Ukyo, aka Jon Montroll, made the announcement in a post on the BitFunder website and on the Bitcoin Talk forum, saying:    “As of November 14, 2013, no BitFunder user will be able to enter into any new positions or sell positions on the BitFunder website.      “…As of the date of this notice, BitFunder is not assessing any new fees against any BitFunder user.”    The closure is another gravestone in a graveyard of dead bitcoin stock exchanges.  BitFunder itself came hot on the heels of shutdown of Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange in October 2012. Another bitcoin exchange, btct.co, also shutdown this year.  Ventures like ASICminer and IceDrill, both bitcoin miners, sold shares on BitFunder but less than a year after launching, things had already begun to go sour. On 8th October 2013, it banned people in the US from using the site.  ""All current BitFunder users who are located in the United States or are determined to be United States persons or entities will not be able to enter into any new positions on the BitFunder website, and, as of November 1, 2013, such users will also not be allowed to sell positions on the BitFunder website.""  A later post on 11th October  advised all US users of BitFunder to move their money out by 1st December. As one might expect, US users took the hint, causing a stock crash on BitFunder.  The decision to ban US users appeared to be in response to moves by the US Securities and Exchange Commisssion (SEC), which regulates stock exchanges, to clamp down on bitcoin.  By preventing US users from trading on the site, the site might have a stronger defence against the long arm of the US law.  It’s unclear if those pressures are connected to the decision to shutter the site entirely.  “I will be making a detailed post explaining more later on. I know this will be hard for some of you, but please try to hold off on the conspiracy theories until then,” wrote Ukyo in his announcement about the closure of the site.  In a short follow-up post  , he admitted that the decision to shut down had been a recent one.  “The intention was to operate the site with verified users only. The decision to shut down completely is very recent.”  We have reached out to him for more information and will update this article accordingly if and when we hear back.  Ukyo is also the owner of WeExchange, a site connected with BitFunder that allows users to trade bitcoin into US, Canadian and Australian dollars.  WeExchange has also been experiencing its fair share of trouble recently. Users have been complaining of delays and problems in withdrawing funds from their accounts and in responses on bitcointalk.org, Ukyo blamed the problems on the underlying bitcoin software infrastructure, bitcoind:  “I really did not think bitcoind would buckle under such a reasonable increase in usage.”  Ukyo hinted that “WeExchange has big news coming very soon”, but with the current turmoil it remains to be seen whether anyone will have stuck around by the time it’s announced.

13181548,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us_subway_sandwich_shop_accept_bitcoins,1384259400,US ‘Subway’ sandwich shop accept bitcoins,"Last week we have published information that Subway sandwich shop in Moscow, Russia is now accepting payment by bitcoin.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,,0,0,CoinTelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us_subway_sandwich_shop_accept_bitcoins,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/cointelegraph/czk1o42xB0G.jpeg
42376668,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6be85,1384253153,Bitcoin-accepting Subway sandwich shop discovered in the US,"Another Subway sandwich shop is now accepting payment by bitcoin.  The shop, in Allentown, Pennslyvania in the US, is the second bitcoin-accepting Subway to come to light after an outlet in Moscow was found to be offering a 10% discount to bitcoiners.  Hints that the shop accepted bitcoin first emerged in a photo of a shop window bitcoin advert for the shop on 8th November.  Sceptical Redditors questioned whether the photo was legit: “Anyone could have taped the sign to the window,” wrote one.  Two days later, on 10th November, video proof was posted by redditor xzclusiv3, showing a purchase being made with bitcoin at the store.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWsd1WwhhNg  The purchase wasn’t entirely seamless, with commenters on the video noting that the video begins in the daytime and ends after dark, suggesting that the purchase took longer than your average credit card payment.  “The guy [at the register] wasn't the owner and never did this before. That and we didn't know what exchange to base the price off of [sic],” wrote xclusive3, explaining the difficulties with the payment.  Few have so far taken up the opportunity to pay with bitcoin at the Subway in question. The bitcoin address in the shop window advert had received a total of 0.018 BTC, or around $6, at the time of writing. The payment made in the video is therefore likely the first and only so far.  Subway sandwich shops are run as franchises, like many other fast-food businesses, meaning that the decision to accept bitcoin payments will have been made by the local owner, rather than the Subway corporation itself.  Photos of a bitcoin-accepting Subway in Moscow surfaced online as early as August, suggesting the Allentown franchise is not the first Subway to accept the digital currency.  As more and more business owners become aware of digital currency, corporations that run a franchise model may have eventually have to address the question of whether to embrace bitcoin payments.  Until then, Allentown and Moscow are two unlikely bitcoin sister cities.
