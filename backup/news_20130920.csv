42397247,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1VX,1379694726,Anonymous iPhone hacking and bitcoin's three most important letters,"Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 20th September 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  What’s in a name?  You’re nothing without a name. That rather glib bit of advice to the would-be famous goes far deeper than just deciding whether to call yourself MC Dethrod or Anthony Featheringale for your next X Factor outing.  Our entry into human society is marked by a naming ceremony, and the Genesis creation myth symbolises mankind’s domination over the natural world by Adam giving all the animals and birds their proper names.  (Think about that if you ever get caught up in an endless “What shall we call our new project?” discussions at work – or, worse, see a few hundred thousand quid disappear into a marketing and branding consultancy in exchange for getting called Qoxiqotica. You can have that one for free, by the way).  In fact, the naming of things is second only to their creation in terms of getting them into our heads and into our society. A nameless thing cannot be talked about, let alone used, in anything other than the most basic fashion. Only when named is it properly part of our world.  So it is with the machineries of finance. The physical part of money is practically vestigial; when your pay arrives in your bank account or a company gets bought for $10bn, nothing involved in those transactions knows or cares a fig about what a £10 note or a $20 bill looks like.  Instead, the codes GBP and USD are used to change strings of digits into actual value. It’s a common language that all financial systems speak. No code, and the money just doesn’t exist.    Bitcoin lacks such a code; BTC has been a useful stand-in, but with no official status. Without the code, a currency can only ever live in the shadowlands of ad-hoc systems, with none of the interchangeability that defines modern global finance.      Getting your code is an important part of any new currency – the most recent being the South Sudan Pound, code SSP, created on independence in 2011 – and normally one of the simpler aspects of the complex political, financial and logistic process of currency creation. And it’s not that difficult – with nearly 40 countries created since 1990, systems are in place. The world knows how to do it.      Bitcoin is in the interesting position of not having a national sponsor but awkwardly existing anyway. It was created, like Adam, out of the dust of the Internet, and is busy thriving on its own recognisance. It just needs its code.    And now it looks as if it may get it. A consensus is rapidly forming in the bitcoin world for XBT, while the financial engineers who run the mainstream transfer systems are making the by-now traditional “can’t see why not, guv” non-approval approval noises.  With Jon Matonis of the Bitcoin Foundation presenting the case at the heart of the beast in Zurich, it seems plausible that the International Standards Organisation committee that runs the ISO 4127 master list of codes will press the button.    But why XBT? As Matonis points out, non-currency value items like gold and silver have their own codes, XAU and XAG created from their chemical symbols, so there’s precedent – never underestimate how good that makes decision makers feel. And there’s no element with the symbol Bt, so that’s one potential cash clash avoided. At least until someone creates Britishtelecominium.    That’s unlikely to happen (and, given BT’s history, even more unlikely to become a major international unit of value). The day that XBT becomes an official code, however, has every chance of being a real piece of history.  Numbers to love, but dangers to watch  Not that the shadowlands of unofficial trading systems are that shadowy these days. American outfit BitPay, which flogs BTC – sorry, XBT – payment systems to merchants, said this week that it had got over 10,000 customers, most in the US, while European company BIPS has some 15,000 customers on its books in the Old World – only 1,000 are merchants, but eyes are being cast at the American market. Plus, BitPay said that Quickbooks, a very popular accounting system, could now import its sales records directly.  One of the key attributes of bitcoin is that it combines a good track record on security with an even better one on ease of implementation – if you want to put bitcoin capability into a system, all the parts are freely available and you don’t have to worry about the underlying safety of the system.  It’s hard to find a good analogy in history; one might be the swift and ruthless assassination of the sheet music industry by records and radio. You probably don’t have a piano in your apartment. Or look at the Internet itself, which has thoroughly murdered all opposition – and there used to be a big global market in unconnected, proprietary networks.  Don’t get too excited, though: the very ease with which you can build bitcoin into things means it’s a simple decision to make – and you don’t have to see a significant increase in revenues to justify it.  With the majority of bitcoin-enabled merchants being e-commerce companies, and the physical retailers of goods and services being heavily invested in the hipster universe, there’s a good risk that a lot of this is driven by fashion rather than fiscal probity. And fashion has a terrible habit of looking intensely important for a moment or two, then vanishing into nostalgia.  Cryptocurrencies won’t vanish as a group – they solve too many problems. But the only thing that will mark any particular currency as properly arrived will be when appreciable numbers of real people start spending the things on a regular basis; without that, all the carefully prepared infrastructure and widely deployed systems will count for nothing.  Social networks and massively multiplayer gaming environments are here to stay, but the predicted online world dominated by Myspace and Second Life never quite panned out.  Thus, enjoy all the metrics that show bitcoin’s supporters pushing out ever further into the real world, and the comfortable sensation from the powers that be gradually taking the whole idea seriously.  But until your next door neighbour proudly shows off their mobile phone wallet when you bump into them in the supermarket, don’t mistake any of that for a winning guarantee.  Giving Apple the finger  John Law is more than normally resistant to the seductive call of Apple. Although exposed early in life – he spent many evenings enthralled by a friend’s Apple II computer, and was transfixed by the Mac’s first appearance seemingly from another universe – he could never actually afford the stuff.  By the time his petty cash fund could bear the brunt, Apple had transformed itself into a cross between a fashion statement and a cult religion. The anarchistic atheism of open source had won his heart.    So it is with a weary eye that he regards the iPhone 5S and 5C, which eschew major innovation for mild tweaks and a chunk of catch-up with Android.      Apple, certainly at one stage, seemed to not like bitcoin, so you could spend more than £700 on a smartphone that has relatively limited bitcoin wallet options. However, bitcoin seems determined to reply in kind.    One of the new features – for iPhones, at least – is the inclusion of a fingerprint swipe on the iPhone 5S’ home key. Instead of typing in a PIN, the happy owner can access their new toy by a gentle touch. Now, increased security is something John Law is very much in favour of and applauds Apple for – if it works. Promised security that introduces new flaws is somewhat worse than useless.  Fingerprint scanners have been found vulnerable in the past. It’s pretty simple to steal a fingerprint; you can lift even the tiny amounts of grease from a normal dab with sticky tape, treat it to make it opaque, then use the image to create a fake finger from a wide variety of cheap household compounds.  John Law once successfully broke into a fingerprint-secured laptop with nothing more than gelatin and milky tea (the tea fooled the ‘skin colour’ test).  Apple hasn’t said much about the various security tests in its digital biometrics; a real finger is warm, conductive and has blood going through it, and modern scanners use a combination of techniques to check for such things.  None of this sounds too hard, though, so it is good to see The Register reporting that a Twitter-based group of hackers is running a crowdsourced competition to encourage the mischievous of the world to find ways to break in. Among the offered prizes – well, bitcoin, of course.  It would be a particularly beautiful irony if bitcoin itself proved to be the fulcrum that springs the thing open. It’s also all to the good if there are easy to implement hacks that these are known and public sooner rather than later – yes, even for Apple, which will have fewer units in the field to fix.  And it’s yet another thing that bitcoin can do, for better or worse: in making it easy for people to chip in anonymously for causes they think worthwhile but which carry a possibility – or certainty – of controversy or personal danger.  You might think that encouraging hacking is bad; it’s certainly not without consequence. But if the cause you want to support is one of impeccable rectitude, yet hugely disapproved of by state or pressure group, then you now not only have a voice but a hand in making it happen.  John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude.

42397236,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Lh,1379684533,Life on Bitcoin couple pays for hotel and flights in bitcoin,"Austin and Beccy Craig, the Utah-based couple living on bitcoin for 90 days, have overcome yet another hurdle and paid for a hotel and flights in bitcoin.  The couple, whose experiences are being filmed for a documentary titled Life on Bitcoin, managed to pay for flights to and from Atlanta plus a hotel room in the city via Bulgaria-based company Simply Travel.  ""Travel is challenging, but the biggest challenge was connecting with the right travel agency. Since we started speaking with Gregor Amon, the CEO at Simply Travel, it's all logistics,"" explained Austin.  Currently, the website only allows users to purchase hotel rooms, but it plans to add flights and rental cars over the next few weeks.  The Life on Bitcoin bloghttp://lifeonbitcoin.com/blog/ cites Amon as saying:  “There will be lots of improvements over the coming weeks, with conversion for additional currencies, added suppliers, stability, etc. However, we are ready to accept bitcoin for hotel reservations in over 300,000 hotels.”  He told CoinDesk he first heard about bitcoin around two years ago but has only been following it closely since the price rocketed in April this year. He said he was cautious about accepting bitcoin after the subsequent price crash, but was still convinced about bitcoin being a ""great technology"".  Faster payments  ""In the travel industry, we transfer a lot of money internationally. It's less of an issue in Europe where a SEPA bank transfer is free and usually at the receiver's account within 24 hours, but everything outside of Europe is a big pain,"" Amon added.  He went on to say he is also faced with credit card charges, fraud risk and chargebacks, all of which can be avoided if payments are made in bitcoin. Amon, who lives in Munch, Germany, said:    ""At the moment, we still have a certain currency conversion risk because we need to pay our suppliers in fiat currency, but I am willing to take that.      It's just such an awesome way of transferring money, I think in a couple of years it will at least replace the way money is sent.""    The company is using BitPay to process bitcoin payments from its customers, but Amon said he doesn't like the 0.99% it charges. ""So in the long run I am thinking of not using any payment provider. It's not that difficult to implement, after all.  ""With the high competition in the travel section, the more cost efficient I am, the better rates I can give my clients.""  Simply Travel has been operating for three years and initially started as a hotel booking service for airline crews. Amon used to be a pilot on private jets flying VIPs internationally so he used the knowledge he gained in that position to build Simply Travel.  Travelling on bitcoin  Austin Craig told CoinDesk he and his wife still have a few details to sort out before they head off to Atlanta to attend the Crypto-Currency Conference on 5th October. ""We'll end up packing a lot like we're going camping, so we can be sure to be prepared for any unexpected scenario. We're not sure how we're going to eat or get to and from the airport. We're hustling to figure that out.""  The couple said that, since starting their challenge, they have done business in bitcoin with around 33 companies. Austin believes this will become a lot more difficult when they are travelling, as companies usually take a few days to integrate the bitcoin payment process system.  ""In my experience, most businesses that are accepting bitcoin today have a very low volume of bitcoin customers. The big companies aren't highly incentivized to make those changes until there are some market signals that people really want to use it,"" he explained.  Austin speculates it could be years before larger travel companies accept payment in bitcoin, but for now the couple are more than happy with using Simply Travel, which is also arranging their flights for their round-the-world trip.

42397241,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Pd,1379670634,Canadian Royal Mint to test 'MintChip' payment system,"The Royal Canadian Mint is to begin testing its MintChip electronic payment system by the end of the year, according to reports. Software engineers at the Mint will begin piloting the system as a new means of paying for goods and services using smart phones and other devices.      Announced in April 2012, MintChip isn't a virtual currency. Instead, it is a mechanism for holding Canadian dollars - and potentially other currencies - electronically as digital cash that can be transferred between participants. The concept has languished publicly, with nothing of note happening since a developer challenge designed to encourage third party innovation around MintChip ended 18 months ago.      Now, however, head of the Royal Mint Marc Brûlé has been busy giving interviews, apparently designed to kindle interest in the idea. The Mint is already working on version 2.0 of the as-yet unimplemented concept.      MintChip uses a silicon chip to store value, but unlike bitcoin, the value is created digitally by the Mint, just as coins are physically minted. This value will then be sent to brokers, who will trade with consumers and businesses.      Those buying chips from brokers will load them onto a chip with a unique ID. To instigate a payment, the specification says that a receiving chip can optionally request the payment, sending its unique ID to the sending chip, along with an amount to be paid. It can also include information such as a text annotation describing the purchase, and a destination URL for the payment to be sent.      The sending chip then generates a value message, cryptographically encoded using a digital signature. This contains the value being transferred, and other information. On receipt, it is verified using the sender's public certificate, and then each chip is debited and credited to reflect the transaction.    To avoid duplicates, the MintChip specification also requires a challenge to be sent. The challenge is complex enough so that the same one will never be sent twice to the same recipient when transferring the same amount.    MintChip devices can be embedded in phones, USB sticks, wallets, laptops, or tablets. The system also allows for hosted MintChip accounts, storing value online with a third-party service provider.      The specification holds some tantalising possibilities. One of the fields in the value message is a currency code. '1' indicates the Canadian dollar, which the specification says is the only one in use at the moment. But it potentially opens up the possibility for other currencies to be used. How open this might be depends on how the specification is finally released, and how tight a grip the Mint retains over it.      As yet, that’s unknown. “MintChip remains an R&D project whose technology and business case we are continuing to test and refine. As such, we are not in a position to comment on its future commercialization,” said Royal Mint spokesperson Alex Reeves, when asked about a go-live date. “Also, note that the Mint does not compare its technology to other digital payment solutions, preferring instead to focus on its unique attributes as a form of digital cash, issued by the trusted custodian of a national currency system.”      It has its critics. Our own Jon Matonis has commented elsewhere on the centralized nature of the MintChip project, which keeps control firmly in the hands of the Mint. And others have similar concerns.      “There is no way in hell it will permit no-limit transactions between private parties anywhere in the world,” said Erik Vorhees in a Reddit post about the currency. Vorhees is the founder of the hugely successful SatoshiDice (which he sold this year) and Coinapult, a site that lets US and Canadian residents send bitcoins via email and SMS. He warned:    ""There will be limits, there will be account registrations, and there will be bank/mint/government oversight.""  Nevertheless, Canada seems to need something new. In 2011, a reporthttp://paymentsystemreview.ca/wp-content/themes/psr-esp-hub/documents/rf_eng.pdf produced by the Task Force for Payments System Review, a government-mandated review body, highlighted the need for payment reform in Canada. Some 27 EU countries and the BRIC region were significantly outpacing Canada's transition to digital payments, the review body said. “Even Peru and Romania"" were ahead of the country, it said.    Thoroughly modernising the payments system could save the Canadian economy up to 2% of GDP in productivity gains, or $32 billion, annually, the report suggested.      “Consumers … increasingly want to pay for purchases online, but too often have limited choices,"" it pointed out, adding:      “They also want to pay bills online, only to find out that processing takes days, often resulting in unwarranted late charges when transactions failed to clear by the deadline.""              Canadians can currently use Interac for online and in-person debit transfers, and Visa Paywave or Mastercard Paypass provide one-tap payments. Google’s Wallet payment service is not yet permitted in the country.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/20/canadian-royal-mint-to-test-mintchip-payment-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc69edb543b618005f6c86401677e00c5d913ee3-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
