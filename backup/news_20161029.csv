42378939,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mUIT,1477753620,Bitcoin Prices Roar Past $700 But Zcash Steals The Show,"Bitcoin may be nearing annual highs, but newcomer Zcash stole the show this week, generating robust momentum even before its launch.  The digital currency, whose use of zero-knowledge proofs is said to offer cryptocurrency users new levels of privacy, released its blockchain and first tokens (zerocoins) on 28th October.  In anticipation of the launch, nascent Zcash futures marketshttps://www.bitmex.com/app/contract/ZECZ16 saw robust trading. The pairs, which traded against bitcoin prior to the release of zerocoins, rose from a low of 0.027 BTC ($18.50) on 15th September to 0.78 BTC ($535) on 28th October. Yet, this figure surged nearly 1,200% to 10 BTC ($6,864) on the day of their launch.  This wasn't the end of its story, however. With a unique release schedule, speculation hit highs often unseen even in the volatile cryptocurrency sector.  Zcash rose to far more impressive heights on digital currency exchange Poloniex, with the price of 1 ZEC reaching roughly 3,300 BTC (or more than $2m), on 28th October. This sharp increase gave way to equally jolting losses, as Zcash was trading at 48 BTC later in the day.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, described the price movements as ""crazy"".  ""There's no way this valuation’s gonna hold,"" he said in reference to the lofty prices reached by Zcash futures.  He added:  ""This is scarcity driving the train, that’s it.""  Longevity concerns  In spite of all the momentum surrounding Zcash, some market observers emphasized that more than one currency has enjoyed surging value before fading from relevance.  ""Like all other cryptos, Zcash will need to prove useful to a large enough market for a long enough period of time to avoid death or irrelevance,"" said Petar Zivkovkski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub.  Digital currency hedge fund manager Jacob Eliosoff took a different tack, asserting that Zcash may be slightly overhyped.  In particular, he cited other blockchain communities that have focused on privacy solutions and that are already in use in the market.  ""Zcash looks like it may offer slightly more thorough anonymity than Monero, but not a major difference from a user or business perspective,” he told CoinDesk.  Eliosoff emphasized that users don’t need the latest cryptocurrency so much as they need digital currencies that protect their identities and work effectively.  Bitcoin enjoys big gains  While Zcash grabbed the lion’s share of attention this week, bitcoin enjoyed a 9% gain as market dynamics and concerns about China’s continued devaluation of the yuan pushed prices higher.  Bitcoin prices surged from $628.62 at 12:00 UTC on 21st October to $686.52 by 12:00 UTC on 28th October, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index figures reveal.  At press time, bitcoin had jumped even further, rising almost 4% to a high of $713.  The digital currency's upward price movement triggered many short squeezes ""across leveraged trading platforms,"" said Zivkovkski, though others suggested the renewed momentum may amount to more of a comeback after weeks of sideways trading.  Whaleclub data indicates that during the week through 12:00 UTC, the market was more than 90% long on all but one day.  The cryptocurrency might enjoy further gains as traders shift their focus away from altcoins, said Eliosoff. He emphasized that bitcoin has both recovered from the Bitfinex hack and approached $700.  Now, ""investors have begun to take profit on various altcoins and focus on the king crypto.""  Ethereum's identity crisis  Both ethereum (ETH) and its alternative blockchain ethereum classic (ETC) suffered weekly losses as the two currencies seem clouded by uncertainty.  The former dropped 6% week-over-week amid sustained denial-of-service attacks, and the latter dropped 4.6% as the ethereum classic blockchain executed a hard fork to stop the same issues.  ""The hard fork as well as turmoil and DDoS attacks on the ethereum network have impacted prices negatively,"" said Zivkovski. ""ETH and ETC are going through an identity crisis: of what use will they be in a future powered by digital currencies?""  Enneking also weighed in on the future relevance of the two currencies, though he stated that the price declines were an obvious side effect of the more immediate technical issues.  ""When ethereum is being attacked repeatedly, that doesn’t look good in the eyes of consumers,"" he quipped.

42378924,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mU5t,1477749722,Bitcoin's Block Size Debate is Back (And It Might Be Worse Than Ever),"Call it bitcoin's broken record.  First heating up in 2015, a debate about how best to scale the digital currency's underlying blockchain remains the dominating disagreement. Despite the best efforts of developers to bring what they say is more nuance to the discussion, a single metric remains the biggest sticking point.  One year later, some miners are again calling for measures that would raise the bitcoin block size in an effort to support more transactions and (they say) grow its user base. Likewise, the developers behind Bitcoin Core (its primary software) remain focused on increasing capacity by way of top-level protocols, arguing that developers and academics believe this is the safest way forward for the still-experimental project.  So, what's different this time around?  For one, a viable scaling solution that boosts the block size, but doesn't focus on the metric (Segregated Witness or 'SegWit') has completed testing and has been released. Further, a new mining pool (ViaBTC) and a prominent bitcoin investor (Roger Ver) are currently running software that supports larger blocks.  The presence of a major miner means the big block movement has some leverage this time in threatening to block SegWit, or perhaps creating its own network through a process known as a 'fork'.  Chairman of the board at the Factom Foundation, David A Johnston, argued that given these recent events a fork is inevitable. In a series of blog posts, he put forth the idea that both groups now have different goals, and that because of this, they may be better off working on two separate networks.  He told CoinDesk:  ""After two-plus years of debate, it seems the few months of time a fork would cost is a small price to pay in order to get development back on track regardless of which side you agree with.""  Is a fork likely?  Not everyone agrees with Johnson's view. Critics argue that past attempts by miners to bid for a bigger block size have largely failed, and that this one is no different.  ""I don't think it's going to happen. There is a very-loud-micro-tiny-minority making arguments not based on reality or future resiliency,"" said Coinkite CEO and founder Rodolfo Novak.  Novak noted that Bitcoin Unlimited follows similar proposals, including Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic, both of which released code to increase the block size to 8 MB and 2 MB, respectively, up from 1 MB today.  But while these proposals generated discussion at first, neither succeeded at reaching the 75% hashrate support threshold to trigger an upgrade. This time, though, it's the continued support of miners that has some observers taking this fork attempt seriously.  ""If the hashrate continues to climb, and I see no reason why it won't, it is a real concern,"" said Steven McKie, product operations manager at Yours, a bitcoin-based social content platform.  But it's hard to say with other scaling solutions on the way.  McKie pointed to the fact that recent announcements suggest SegWit and Lightning – scaling methods preferred by Core developers – are moving forward.  ""With Lightning-like implementations coming online, it may dull the block size debate enough to keep things going business as usual. [It's] hard to gauge at the moment until we see next moves,"" McKie said.  Different visions  Either way, Johnston thinks that the only natural solution to the long-standing debate is for the network to split along social lines.  ""Rather than continue endless fights on the topic, it seems more productive for the two groups to go their separate ways,"" he said.  He argued that ethereum’s split was a great example of a successful social fork, since each group can now focus on their respective vision for the network without the previous bitterness.  On the other hand, BTCC chief operating officer Samson Mow argued that ViaBTC and others can fork to form their own currency at any time (without a hard fork).  ""If they truly believe the current block size is holding back exponential adoption, causing users to suffer from high fees or unreliable confirmation times and preventing business with millions of users from integrating bitcoin, then shouldn't they fork to solve all of those dire problems?"" he argued.  For now, however, it seems the two groups are still attached to their economic marriage.  Mow worried the move could threaten not only bitcoin's future but the livelihood of those who are dedicated to supporting it.  ""A contentious hard-fork would wipe out billions of dollars in value for people and companies who hold bitcoin as an asset,"" he said.  Consensus, consensus  Still, these comments suggest that the past ethereum hard fork continues to be a reference point in bitcoin's debate.  The best-known display of a hard fork without full support (and its failure or success depending on point of view), the two networks (ethereum and ethereum classic) now both operate separately, commanding about as much value as they did before.  But, bitcoin's supporters believe its status could be harmed by a similar move, eroding confidence that the network will deliver on its promise to differ from traditional, top-down payment networks by ditching majority rule.  In this way, the hard fork debate may be more about whether 95% is too high a threshold to enact a change on a blockchain, or whether all participants in a blockchain are really part of a willing economic coalition.  Johnston worried that bitcoin will never progress if changes to the software require all of its participants to agree.  ""The 95% level of adoption seems a recipe for calcification, where new innovations effectively become impossible to get adopted,"" Johnston said.  Others, like faculty member at the University of Nicosia, George Papageorgiou, are optimistic about bitcoin’s future and see the block size debate as a healthy ongoing conversation, as bitter as it has been.  ""Discourse and different opinions are very much a part of this evolution and I don't think they should stop or be hampered in any way,"" he said.  What about a future fork?  While many bitcoin developers and observers oppose the most recent effort to fork, most agree that the option is on the table.  Adding fuel to the fire is that, without solid definitions, everyone is free to come to their own conclusion about how and when such decisions are made.  ""There's nothing wrong with a hard fork. The only question is how it's done,"" Mow said, again arguing for a non-contentious change.  This disagreement has also arguably diminished developer attention to the issue.  Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo noted the lack of hard fork proposals at bitcoin's most recent annual developer conference, noting that Core developers are not ignoring the topic. ""Private discussion"" has been ongoing, he said, with many suggesting rollout proposals to make a hard fork easier.  He wrote:  ""Hopefully this type of discussion can move more into the public eye.""
