42385226,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnr2d,1607125575,"Waters Tells Biden to Rescind OCC Crypto Guidance; May Be Part of Anti-Trump, Anti-Crypto Offensive","U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, who chairs the powerful House Financial Services Committee, wants President-elect Joe Biden to rescind or monitor all of the cryptocurrency-related guidance issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).      Waters' comments in a letter Friday follows weeks after fellow Democrat members of the House Financial Services Committee criticized the OCC's crypto-related actions during the COVID-19 pandemic.      It also comes days after those same members introduced a bill that would require stablecoin issuers to seek bank charters and secure regulatory approval to issue tokens.      In this light, Waters' action is bound to be seen as part of a coordinated effort to impose more severe regulatory oversight on stablecoins, if not all cryptocurrencies, as a way to undo what she termed the harm of President Donald Trump's administration.      ""As you begin to carry out the mandate given to you by the American people to restore trust in the federal government, I would like to highlight several areas where you and your team should immediately reverse the actions of your predecessors,"" she wrote.      In her letter, Waters (D-Calif.) called on Biden to rescind guidance by the OCC that national banks may hold stablecoin reserves as a service to bank customers.      Waters also is recommending similar guidance by the OCC that allowed federally chartered banks and federal savings associations to provide cryptocurrency custody services for customers be rescinded.      Each of these recommendations would undo work conducted by Brian Brooks, the Acting Comptroller of the Currency. Brooks was recently nominated to serve a full five-year term by Trump.      Read more: OCC Chief Hints at Coming 'Good' Actions on Crypto by End of Trump's Term      ""Your appointed officials at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) must also not assume, as their predecessors have, that a law Congress passed over 150 years ago somehow gives them authority to provide a national bank charter to non-bank fintech or payment companies,"" she wrote.      Under a section on financial stability, Waters wrote that the Financial Stability Oversight Council and Office of Financial Research should publish their analysis on developments and the existing regulatory framework around digital assets and distributed ledger technology.      If Waters and the three Democrat sponsors of the bill – Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill.) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) – are indeed intent on rolling back the OCC's pro-crypto guidance as a way to undo what they perceive as Trump's legacy, an assertion earlier Friday by Brooks that ""we're very focused on not killing (crypto innovation)"" may prove hollow.      The acting comptroller finds himself in an unenviable position. On the one side, the outgoing administration is rumored to be planning to issue self-hosted wallet regulation, a plan that already has the crypto industry up in arms. Now, the moves by Waters and the other Democrat representatives may bode poorly for the crypto space in the U.S., particularly should the Republicans lose the Senate runoff election in Georgia and thus control of the Senate.

42385235,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnrCh,1607121708,Coin Center Donations Top $100K Worth of Dai Following Anti-Stablecoin Bill Proposal,"Anti-stablecoin legislation has been a boon for donations to Coin Center, a cryptocurrency think tank and policy advocacy group, with the organization receiving over $100,000 in donations – paid out in stablecoins – two days after the bill was introduced.      Cryptocurrency investors, entrepreneurs and enthusiasts showed strong support for the industry’s leading policy advocacy group after three U.S. Democrat representatives introduced a bill that would require stablecoin issuers to secure bank charters and maintain either Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation cover or reserves in order to continue operating.      Coin Center donations were sent via Gitcoin in USDC, dai, and some ether with the Washington, D.C.-based organization receiving more than $130,000 from over 100 donors. An additional $60,000 in matched funds is set to be paid out at the end of the donation period later this month.      Even though the bill is effectively dead on arrival due to the approaching end of the congressional session, if introduced next session and passed the bill would also require issuers to receive permission from a host of regulatory agencies to actually circulate tokens, and could potentially place legal restrictions around node operators for networks like Ethereum.      “We are incredibly grateful to the [decentralized finance] and Ethereum communities for this outpouring of support,” said Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications for Coin Center. Praising the mechanism by which they received the donations, Agrawal added, “Gitcoin is an amazing platform for people who care about an issue to fund a solution.”      Donations sent via Gitcoin represent nearly 10% of Coin Center’s more than $1 million annual budget.      Writing about the bill in a post published Thursday, Coin Center’s director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh said the legislation targets stablecoins instead of “traditional money transmitters” perhaps because “it is easier to pick on a young, innovative industry with fewer political allies than an older sector with deeper pockets.”      The STABLE Act claims to be a way to define ""deposits"" as they pertain to digital assets. If stablecoins act like money, they should be regulated like money, Willamette University College of Law assistant professor Rohan Grey, an adviser to the bill, told CoinDesk on Wednesday.      The bill would regulate collateral-backed stablecoins like dai as well as dollar-backed coins like USDC.

42411937,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhEB2,1607120400,What Is a CBDC?,"CBDC stands for “central bank digital currency,” a type of virtual currency that governments around the world are experimenting with and investigating. What sets a CBDC apart from established currencies is that proponents hope it can use new payment technology, typically a blockchain, to potentially increase payment efficiency and lower costs.  This new type of currency is still early in its development. Most countries are still exploring and testing the idea, such as the U.S. form of a digital dollar. A few ambitious countries, notably China with its digital yuan, have already finished a demo and are piloting the technology. But a CBDC has yet to be deployed on a large scale.  Each country exploring a CBDC has its own approach. Several CBDCs are based on the same general principles and blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin.  Blockchain technology allows many different entities to hold a copy of a history of transactions so that history is distributed and not controlled by a single entity.  Several countries are known to be experimenting with blockchain-inspired CBDCs. Venezuela was a pioneer in this respect, launching its own cryptocurrency, the petro, in 2018. However, the petro is plagued by scandals and very few Venezuelans actually use it.  Common CBDC features  CBDCs are very early-stage, but in many cases, a CBDC is like a hybrid of Bitcoin and a government-issued currency. The resulting CBDC creation pulls in attributes of each, and specific features can include the following:  Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)  We live in a digital world and our money is mostly digital to begin with. We use apps on our smartphones to glimpse our balances. We use credit cards to make payments. So how is a CBDC different?  CBDCs are digital, but with a different technological makeup. They are generally proposed to reengineer money from the ground up, with many borrowing from Bitcoin's underlying technology with distributed ledger technology (DLT).  In order to keep track of money, banks need to store financial records, such as how much money a person has and what transactions they've made, in a ledger.  Instead of one central database storing all the financial records of people, DLT is composed of several copies of this transaction history, each stored and managed by a separate financial entity, and usually managed from the top by the country's central bank. These financial entities share DLT together in a distributed manner.  This is what's known as a permissioned blockchain, because only a select few entities can access and/or alter the blockchain. In addition, central entities control who gets access to the blockchain and what they can do with it. For instance, the central entity might decide that Alice can only read the blockchain, while Bob can both modify and read the blockchain.  This sits in contrast to a permissionless blockchain, such as Bitcoin, which allows anyone to run the software and participate in sending transactions on the network. No central entity can turn users away.  Centralized Control  There's a reason CBDCs choose this permissioned blockchain. Though DLT has some similarities with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the goals are very different.  Bitcoin and other public blockchains like Ethereum are unique in that no central entity or group of entities (as is the case with DLT) is in charge. That's typically not a property that sits well with governments.  Governments are choosing DLT technology because they can still retain control over certain aspects such as:  The supply: Bitcoin has a limit of 21 million bitcoins built into the protocol, and it is impossible to change this limit. In contrast, governments each have a central bank, which is in charge of the country's money supply. These powerful banks choose when to remove or add money to the supply, such as to stimulate the economy in troubled times, and set national interest rates, among other tasks. These roles aren't going to change with CBDCs.  Who runs it: A central entity will choose which financial entities participate in managing the distributed ledger. This differs from Bitcoin, which allows anyone to run the software, without permission.  Lower costs and higher efficiency  Advocates claim that because of the way CBDCs are structured under the hood, they could lead to lower costs for transferring money. The idea is that with a CBDC, financial entities are more connected, making a smoother way to move money around than the disjointed financial system that's in place today.  Tracking payments  DLTs give a full record of all the transactions. Some governments, such as China, which is known for its extensive surveillance apparatus, will potentially want to use this financial information to keep tighter tabs on its citizens.  Different governments are leaning toward different policies in this respect. For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve seems more eager to preserve the privacy of U.S. citizens in case it adopts a CBDC.  See Also: Just Saying No to Digital Dollars Means Cementing the Surveillance Status Quo  CBDC FAQ  Will CBDCs replace the money we use today?  Most countries see a CBDC as a supplementary form of money, not necessarily a currency that will completely replace the existing infrastructure.  What countries currently have CBDCs?  Several countries have launched CBDCs, including the Bahamas, Jamaica and Nigeria, though some view Nigeria’s CBDC as a cautionary tale. While Nigeria pioneered the use of CBDCs with its launch of the eNaira in 2021, the infrastructure to support it has been lacking and the citizens are reluctant to give up cash.  How many countries are experimenting with CBDCs?  In January 2020, a survey found only 10% of central banks reported they were exploring the idea, but a more recent survey by the Atlantic Council found 114 countries are currently exploring CBDCs. Some countries investigating CBDCs include:  China, who launched their pilot of the e-CNY in 2021, is one of the countries most advanced with their tests. The digital yuan already represents 0.13% of cash and reserves held by the central bank.  U.S. President Joe Biden issued an executive order in March, 2023 to urgently assess the benefits and risks of CBDCs.  India, currently testing both a wholesale CBDC and a retail CBDC.  Russia, testing digital ruble payments in April, 2023.  Japan is launching a pilot in April, 2023.  The United Arab Emirates, which expects the first phase of its digital dirham to be complete in 2024.  Australia is currently testing the eAUD with partners like Mastercard, the Australian Bond Exchange, DigiCash and others.  Why are some U.S. lawmakers opposed to CBDCs?  In 2023, both Senator Ted Cruz and Florida governor Ron DeSantis proposed bans on CBDCs. Cruz believes cryptocurrency should not be in control of a centralized government and DeSantis has stated concerns of “government-sanctioned surveillance” if CBDCs are used. Both Republicans noted fears that a centralized digital dollar would stifle innovation in the industry.  Will all CBDCs use blockchains?  No. While many central banks see blockchains as bringing benefits such as efficiency gains, several central banks have expressed skepticism, arguing a blockchain-inspired CBDC does not bring enough benefits to justify creating and maintaining one.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-cbdc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e29dd73362bd163f70b71284016c4888af58479f-1420x946.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether options traders appear less inclined to place bets on the asset’s price, as evidenced by lower Deribit volume.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $18,975 as of 21:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET).

Bitcoin prices slipped on sell volume at around 10:00 UTC (5 a.m. ET) Friday, pushing price below the $19,000, albeit temporarily. It was up to $18,975 as of press time.      Low spot volumes on CoinDesk 20 exchanges are plaguing the market for the third day in a row, with Friday’s $973 million in daily volume as of press time lower than Thursday’s $1.1 billion in daily volume and Wednesday’s $1.3 billion in trading activity across the eight major exchanges.      However, spot trading activity often belies the impact of the institutional market, which often uses over-the-counter or quantitative strategies to scoop up bitcoin, noted Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer. “We are watching Grayscale and PayPal continue to suck up BTC, but volumes should be lighter over the weekend as traders assess their positions,” said Edgerton. (Grayscale is a sister company to CoinDesk.)      Read More: Bitcoin Price Could Hit $50K in 2021, Bloomberg Analysts Say      Some tax-related profit-taking might be in store for the balance of December, added Edgerton. “We are also getting to the point where investors in the U.S. start to review their portfolios from a tax optimization point of view, which could lead to selling pressure in the U.S. over the next few weeks.”      “Bitcoin has had a good run for the last two months, so a pause or even a pullback are and have been expected,” said Elie Le Rest, partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha. He also suspects there will be further sell-offs as various market participants such as miners or long-term holders may look to exchange crypto for cold hard cash. “The interest is to sell in a strong market in order to reduce their negative market impact,"" he said, ""but as the markets look weak, they may not sell right now.”      According to data from aggregator Glassnode, the number of bitcoin addresses withdrawing from exchanges is much lower than those depositing so far this year. Glassnode calculates over 200,000 separate addresses have been receivers in transactions receiving funds from exchanges in 2020.      Meanwhile, over 700,000 addresses appeared as senders in transactions sending bitcoin to exchanges in 2020 so far.      More bitcoin is going into exchanges than coming out, at least according to Glassnode data. What traders plan to do with those balances is anyone’s guess, but ExoAlpha’s Le Rest also reiterated the potential for December profit-taking. “After a torrid bull run, a sideways or even a 15% pullback is definitely expected before a new bull run can take place.” Le Rest added.    Ether options volumes dropping    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Friday, trading around $588 and slipping 4% in 24 hours as of 21:15 UTC (4:15 p.m. ET).

There is no clear decisiveness at the moment,” Magadini told CoinDesk.      “Traders are taking a 'wait and see' approach right now in the ETH options market,” Magadini added. He noted that traders aren’t even all that interested in downside protection in the form of put options. That’s an indicator that many options traders expect ether’s price to bounce back up. “As ETH retraces below $600, no one is enthusiastic about buying puts,” he said.

42385243,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnrIz,1607117350,"Psychology, Sell Pressures Keep Bitcoin Below $20K","Less than a week ago, bitcoin’s price set a new all-time high at $19,920.53. However, the oldest cryptocurrency is still struggling to break above the $20,000 level.      The reason that milestone remains elusive, according to analysts and traders, is simple: There are too many sell orders very near the $20,000 level because some bitcoin holders are afraid of near-term sell-offs. That price point is particularly significant because it’s roughly where the market topped out in the late 2017 rally that saw bitcoin quadruple in price within two months, only to collapse by 70% within the subsequent two months, its biggest (at the time) price correction.      “A huge [number] of sellers are offering orders near the $20,000 level, which has no doubt created a strong resistance level,” Simons Chen, executive director of investment and trading at Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance, said. “People are trying to sell at this level based on what happened during the 2017 bull market.”      For some, similarities to 2017 are hard to ignore, particularly the speed by which bitcoin made new record prices.      The $20,000 level ""is like psychological warfare for many,” said Lingxiao Yang, chief operating officer at crypto quant firm Trade Terminal. “It only took about a month for bitcoin to go up from around $14,000 to the new all-time high.”      But Yang also said that this emotional element has largely been reflected on the retail investors' side, while more institutions are in the ""buy the dip"" mindset.      Market fundamentals are also weighing on bitcoin. Data from crypto analytics site CryptoQuant indicate major bitcoin holders, or whales, have not been withdrawing bitcoin from exchanges.      “The fact that whales don’t withdraw means that BTC is available for selling,” Ki Young Jun, chief executive officer of CryptoQuant said in a tweet. “If whales think the price will go up, they’ll withdraw BTC a lot.”      Further evidence of increased selling pressure near $20,000 is that a growing number of “wrapped” bitcoin have been “unwrapped” from the cooling decentralized finance (DeFi), according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant.      When the Ethereum-based DeFi space was garnering all the attention in the past summer, bitcoins were tokenized (or “wrapped”) on Ethereum. At one point there were more bitcoins being wrapped on Ethereum than bitcoins being created by bitcoin miners.

42385240,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnrLV,1607104713,Money Reimagined: Bitcoin vs. Gold Is a Battle of Narratives,"One reason I feel privileged to write about digital money is the ideas and technologies it seeks to disrupt aren’t just a few years or decades old. They date back centuries, even millennia.      Like gold, for example.      As bitcoin’s price has soared to new all-time highs and a parade of big-name investment professionals such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and hedge fund legend Stanley Druckenmiller have talked up its prospects as a provably scarce store-of-value, a war of words has sprung up between gold bugs and bitcoin fans.      Peter Schiff, one of the loudest proponents of gold as both a store-of-value investment and as a global standard for backing currencies, has been especially triggered. This past week saw a flurry of tweets from Schiff, labeling bitcoin a speculative instrument that lacks gold’s physical safe haven properties and complaining about the lack of airtime given to gold advocates versus bitcoiners. (Check the replies for colorful responses from bitcoin fans.)      This fight reflects something much bigger than a Twitter troll spat. It stems from an audacious effort by the crypto community to rewrite an ancient narrative.      Ultimately, winning the narrative is what will matter in this competition. As we’ve discussed before, a currency can have a host of worthy properties, but if there’s no belief in it, if the story doesn’t resonate, it won’t be accepted as money among a community of users.    Gold: Of kings and conquest    Gold’s proponents frequently mention the qualities that make it a sound store-of-value with which to hedge against fiat currency debasement. Let’s run through them:      It’s durable. Gold can’t be destroyed.      It’s fungible. In its pure state, bullion holds the same value regardless of which bar you have in your hand, enabling its acceptance as both a medium of exchange and store-of-value.      It’s divisible. After smelting, gold can be broken down into coins and ingots of any size.      It’s portable. Within limits, you can transport gold from one place to another.      And most important, it’s scarce. Setting aside the future viability or otherwise of asteroid mining, the slow and expensive pace at which the world’s known gold reserves can be extracted means that, unlike fiat paper currencies, its supply can’t be expanded at will.      Note, these properties are also ascribed to bitcoin – rightly, in my mind, and with a superiority to gold. (Bitcoin is certainly more portable and more easily divisible, and its scarcity is arguably more reliable.)      But while durability, fungibility, divisibility, portability and scarcity are necessary preconditions for sound, non-fiat money, they’re not enough on their own. There are other precious metals, such as silver and platinum, with similar qualities. And there are altcoins literally built from the same code as bitcoin. What ultimately distinguishes both gold and bitcoin from their competitors is the wide collective belief in their shared value.      For gold, this belief is not only widely held. It runs deep. Very deep.      Gold is the stuff of fairy tales such as the one about King Midas. It powered the conquest of the Americas, encapsulated in the search for El Dorado. It became synonymous with wealth and power.      And with beauty – to the point where we talk of gold’s beauty as if it’s innate or intrinsic. But beauty is culturally constructed. While evidence suggests gold’s use in jewelry preceded its use as money, there’s a circular, reinforcing logic to the aesthetic idea. Centuries of associating gold with wealth and power elevated its beauty in our minds.      In other words, there’s a powerful feedback loop arising from the “all that glitters is gold” story. It reinforces its cultural power – an ephemeral, intangible concept that’s actually more important than those five aforementioned physical qualities in giving gold its longstanding status as a universal store-of-value.    Bitcoin: Math for the masses    So, as you can tell, those driving the bitcoin narrative face a daunting competitor, a phenomenon with millennia-old cultural heft.      Yet, this moment feels ripe for a new story. We’ve entered a digital age, where the physical world is increasingly shaped and managed by a separate computing world. That world needs a “digital gold,” not a physical gold.      And it turns out the way to create that digital gold is by combining the power of math – another ancient, all-powerful human invention that rules how we live – with the power of collective human activity. That combination is what makes the bitcoin story so compelling.      At its essence, the proof-of-work consensus model (which lets us trust the transactions recorded in bitcoin’s distributed blockchain ledger) hinges on the fact that it’s mathematically really, really hard to find a randomly chosen number within a data set comprising quadrillions of other numbers. There’s something quite universal – literally, of the universe – in that.      But bitcoin’s claim to provable scarcity, which is fundamental to the store-of-value narrative that institutional investor big shots are now globbing onto, depends on more than its math – which, after all, can be and has been replicated in altcoin forks of the code. It also stems from mass human engagement and investment (of time, money and energy).      Bitcoin’s predictably scarce money supply depends on it being prohibitively expensive for anyone to take control of the network and on there being a sufficiently large, committed, international pool of developers working on keeping its code secure.      That’s where the widening resonance of the narrative becomes self-fulfilling. As more and more people believe in bitcoin, more and more will invest in it, which makes it increasingly expensive to attack it. Meanwhile, wider belief means more and more developers care about protecting bitcoin’s value. Both factors make it increasingly secure, which in turn increasingly strengthens its scarcity claim.      To me, this is what makes the bitcoin story more appealing than that of gold. Rather than stories of kings and conquest, it’s about human engagement under the governance of universal mathematical principles.      This epic narrative battle has a long way to go. I look forward to chronicling its development.    Central bank gold-buying spree    Speaking of gold, this chart in a story by financial news outlet Finbold jumped out at me. From a survey of the 12 largest economies in the world, Finbold found the central banks of U.S., China, Russia and India had accumulated a whopping 208.34 tons of gold between March and early-December this year. Their combined tally dwarfs an aggregate liquidation of 12.78 tons by the eight other countries in that list. It's not clear where Finbold got its data from and it should be noted that central bank gold reserve information is notoriously difficult to confirm. But with that caveat in mind, the numbers are worth exploring.      Why the big buildup in gold holdings by these four countries since the COVID-19 pandemic became a global crisis? The natural answer is that, like people, governments see gold as a hedge against economic and monetary stress, and the crisis has elevated the risk of that. But thinking about the four countries’ individually offers some other hypotheses.      The U.S. and Indian numbers are somewhat self-explanatory. For the U.S. Federal Reserve, its massive mid-pandemic monetary expansion necessarily required the buildup of a giant balance sheet of financial assets, of which gold was a part. And India, mostly for cultural reasons, has always been a giant gold buyer, so these numbers are perhaps just an extension of that.      The Chinese and Russian stories are potentially more interesting. Typically, these two countries buy dollars, held in U.S. government Treasury bonds, as their reserve asset. That they’re also accumulating gold could point to something of a loss of confidence in the dollar. More important, the question is what they might do with that gold in the future.      And that’s where an insight from Jennifer Zhu Scott, executive chairman of The Commons Project, makes this interesting. Speaking during a recent Money Reimagined podcast episode, she noted that although it’s clear that China has been growing its gold reserves significantly, no one knows for sure how much it holds. That, she speculates, could put China in a powerful position to give the digital yuan clout in the international marketplace.      “When the digital [renminbi]is launched, China doesn’t even need to say this is backed by gold. China might just make an announcement saying ‘Oh, by the way, our real gold reserve is actually 4,000 tons.’” (According to Finbold, China’s total holdings currently stand at 2,196 tons.) That would give the new digital currency a solid basis, which may encourage other countries to use it. At the same moment, it would allow China to avoid the volatility it would otherwise face when it ends capital controls, a step it must take if it is to achieve wider international usage of the yuan.      What about Russia? Well, like China, one of the reasons it is thought to be keen on creating a digital currency is to have a mechanism by which it can reduce its dependence on the dollar – in its case, to achieve the explicitly expressed goal of avoiding U.S. sanctions. A hefty gold reserve might also help it do that.      The bigger question, as per the column above, is whether these countries will eventually be better off accumulating bitcoin, rather than gold, as the backstop to their currencies.    Global town hall    THUMBS DOWN. A column by Sarah Frier in Bloomberg’s daily “Fully Charged” newsletter this week highlighted the excessive power Facebook wields over advertisers and the audiences they seek. Small businesses that have become dependent on Facebook ads for lead generation are now frustrated to find themselves in “Facebook jail” – locked out of the platform by an algorithm that’s supposed to police inappropriate content across its 3 billion users. The problem, Frier writes, is that “tiny glitches or misfires of this system can take down innocent users, who then have to hope a real human sees the mistake and resolves it. That's a process that can take days, if it happens at all.”      The article is another example of the growing recognition that big centralized Internet platforms such as Google and Facebook have de facto monopoly powers that can harm the economy, a mindset that is feeding into the increased risk of antitrust action against them. As Frier writes, “For a company that's fervently trying to convince lawmakers it's not a monopoly, some advice: It’s usually a bad thing when an entire sector of the economy is dependent on your service in order to survive.”      What’s still missing from the mainstream conversation about these problems is a discussion of how more decentralized models of media control might better address them. Whether it’s a blockchain solution or something else, we need to recognize that the centralized architecture of internet platforms is the root of their gatekeeping powers. Whatever the solution, that context is vital for how society thinks about a redesign of the social media and digital content industry.      STABLECARD. The expansion of stablecoin payments was given another boost this week when Forbes’ Michael Del Castillo ran a story saying card network Visa would give its 60 million merchants worldwide access to USDC, the stablecoin token developed by Circle Internet Financial and CoinBase. What’s interesting about that is USDC, as a bearer token, can move across borders from one party to another without the need for an intermediary. What it didn’t have was the network of users Visa offers. This looks like a solution for moving money internationally without using correspondent banks and the SWIFT messaging system. Another step toward disintermediated global finance.      BTC YIELD. Dan Held, who heads up growth at crypto exchange Kraken, has done a favor for everyone interested in turning their otherwise static bitcoin into an interest-earning asset. There are a host of ways to earn yield on your bitcoin these days and Held, who has been experimenting with them over much of the past year, created a summary of experiences and results in a useful tweet thread.      What I find interesting is that Held’s thread gives you a sense of the DIY nature of an emerging, decentralized financial system. In this system, bitcoin becomes a universal reserve asset, a form of collateral against which loans and speculative positions form.      Note: Interest payments in bitcoin markets are mostly derived by speculators, who borrow bitcoin from entities such as BlockFi to place short-selling bets. One way they do so, as Held points out, is to play the arbitrage between spot market prices and those quoted on derivative assets such as the CME bitcoin futures of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC. (Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent company of CoinDesk.) That’s quite different from, say, earning interest on your dollar deposits at a bank, but it does look like how a lot of funding happens in the interbank market. Banks obtain short-term funds by lending out Treasury securities and other collateral, which are then used in short-selling operations.      For now, at least, it’s people, not institutions, who are providing the collateral and liquidity need for the back office aspects of a capital market system.    Relevant reads    Why Ethereum and Bitcoin Are Very Different Investments. News you can use.

US Lawmakers Introduce Bill That Would Require Stablecoin Issuers to Obtain Bank Charters. This bill, introduced by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and others, may be a well-intended effort to protect consumers. But the overwhelming backlash from crypto experts, including many sympathetic to Tlaib’s interest in curtailing abuses of the little guy and boosting financial access, shows how badly it was thought out.

The U.S. Treasury Department will keep a vigilant eye on digital innovations. And trading volumes on OKEx have plummeted.    Top shelf    Forced burn Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz tweeted the community could force the burning of billions of the protocol’s XRP native tokens held in escrow to prevent the drop in price that would likely occur should those billions in frozen tokens ever flood the market. On Dec. 2 a Twitter user asked the CTO, “If Nodes, validators and the community at large got together and we agree that it's better for the community to burn the 50 billion XRP Ripple has in escrows, would that be possible?” Responding to the tweet, David Schwartz implied that majority rule would win in such a decision.      Innovation or risk? The U.S. Department of the Treasury wants state and federal regulators to keep a vigilant watch on digital asset innovation, which could upset the balance of the current financial system. According to a report released on Thursday by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, digital assets are a “particularly good example” of both benefits and potential risks associated with innovation. The report highlighted the ambitions by nations around the world in their experiments with central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as a way to “enhance the global standing of their own currencies and enable faster payments.”      Unwrapped wBCT Wrapped bitcoin, the bitcoin-backed token on Ethereum now worth over $2 billion, has seen an increase in burns (or “unwrappings”) by some of its largest users as the Ethereum-based decentralized finance sector continues to cool. BitGo clients including Three Arrows Capital and Alameda Research are exchanging an increasing amount of their tokenized bitcoins minted earlier this year for real bitcoins as the bullish cryptocurrency market continues to center on bitcoin and Ethereum’s decentralized finance takes a back seat for now. In the months following DeFi’s red-hot summer when bitcoins were wrapped faster than they were mined, the sector has cooled significantly.      Not OK A sharp drop in OKEx’s trading volume and stablecoin reserves – tether in particular – may reveal an ongoing exodus of its users after the popular crypto derivatives exchange unexpectedly halted all crypto withdrawal activities for about five weeks. Data from analytics service CryptoQuant shows the amount of tether held in OKEx wallets has dropped to 6.69 million from 275.0 million between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, down 97.6% in less than a week. At the same time, total daily trading volume on OKEx has declined significantly during the same time period – down approximately 67.7% from Nov. 25, according to data compiled by CoinDesk. The volume of tether traded on OKEx plunged 70%.      Mirror, mirror The creators of stablecoin platform Terra announced the launch of the Mirror Protocol Thursday, a way to mint crypto assets that mimic the value of shares in publicly traded companies like Apple or Tesla. The new protocol will also bring a new liquidity mining opportunity to Terra’s Tendermint-based blockchain. Known as mAssets, these tokens will track the price of U.S.-based equities in the real stock market, using an oracle system that’s able to check prices every six minutes. “The retail investor is at the center of this growing demand for U.S. equities and global equity derivatives.

In 2017, a small business owner sold all his assets – company, house and accumulated detritus – and moved his family of five into a van. “We stepped into bitcoin because we wanted to change our lives,” Didi Taihuttu told CNBC.      That’s wild! The media also quoted Taihuttu’s price prediction for a $200,000 bitcoin by 2022. He’s a man that acts on instinct and knows things in his gut. It’s seemingly worked out for him so far. CNBC went on to quote several price predictions from the respected and respectable folk in crypto.      Mike Novogratz, CEO of merchant bank Galaxy Digital, reportedly said bitcoin could reach $60,000 by next year. While a Citibank report geared for institutional clients made the case that one BTC could change hands for $318,000 by December 2021. That’s really wild!      Unquoted was Bloomberg’s recent, and more modest, prediction that bitcoin could hit $50,000 sometime next year. That’s more than double the price of bitcoin’s all-time high! And infers a $1 trillion market cap!      A lot of good data gets thrown into price predictions. There’s technical analysis of candles and wedges, there are surveys of high-net individuals and comparisons to similar movements in both bitcoin’s historical charts as well as analogue assets. (Want to understand bitcoin today? Study gold in the 1970s!)      But I wouldn’t put much store in them. This time three years ago, computer whiz and self-declared madman John McAfee had such strong convictions that bitcoin would hit $500,000 within three years (this year, incidentally) he would ingest his genitals.      After years of target prices that were well off their mark, it’s reasonable to suggest that most claims on bitcoin’s future price are more gut than calculus, more wager than assured.

Speaking to David Rubenstein at a Friday Bloomberg event, Corbat made clear CBDCs are an ""inevitable"" development in the future of money. Citigroup, the multinational banking giant, is helping bring that future about.      ""We've been working with governments around the world in terms of the creation and commercialization"" of sovereign digital currencies, he said.      Read more: Central Bankers, Experts Outline Possible Scenarios for CBDC Adoption      Corbat did not disclose Citigroup's government partners.      Citi spokesperson Danielle Romero Apsilos said Citigroup is ""actively participating"" in CBDC consultations being held by central banks.      ""As a significant practitioner in the payments market with connections to over 200 clearing systems, Citi is providing experience-based insights into the design choices involved in the formulation of digital currencies,"" she said.      Citigroup's press office did not immediately return a request for comment on the extent of the partnerships.      Cryptocurrencies will have a role to play even the age of CBDCs, Corbat said Friday. He stopped short of commenting on bitcoin specifically. But he said that ""some of these currencies will be continued alternatives, continued different sources of payment that people can take advantage of based on the underlying nature of what they are"" – a seeming reference to stablecoins.      The Friday disclosure reveals Citigroup as the latest private-sector company active in developing public sector digital currencies. Financial services firms Mastercard and Visa have both launched CBDC initiatives in the past year.      Three years ago, Corbat predicted CBDCs would arise as a direct response to the threat posed by bitcoin. His bank has been researching digital currencies since at least 2014.

42385232,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnrAB,1607092200,Bolivia Essentially Banned Crypto but Blockchain Advocates Are Pushing Back,"Earlier this year, Bolivian blockchain engineer Mario Blacutt – previously known in crypto circles only as “Berzeck” –finally felt safe enough to reveal his name and come out as the creator of a new blockchain network.      Blacutt let down his guard after the left-wing government that had banned crypto fell in November 2019, and its leader, Evo Morales, fled to Mexico.      A year earlier, Blacutt had his bank accounts shut down and his credit card taken away. The banks cited a directive put out by Bolivia’s central bank (BCB) in 2014 prohibiting virtual currencies, and flagged funds received in Blacutt’s accounts via crypto exchanges Bitstamp and Bitinka. Blacutt was paid in cryptocurrency.      “They said it was to protect me. This is a funny thing,” Blacutt said.      Even as many governments around the world embrace or at least regulate cryptocurrency, Bolivia is one of the rare countries that tried to stamp it out entirely.      A 2014 central bank circular technically only prohibited the use of crypto by banks and in commercial transactions or payments. But in 2017, Bolivian authorities arrested 60 individuals who were allegedly “undergoing training related to the investment of money in cryptocurrencies,” according to a statement released by the country’s financial authority ASFI.      So when Morales fled, Blacutt felt more at ease. “After he was ousted, I was more free to use my identity because I was optimistic that things were finally changing,” he told CoinDesk.      But now, Morales is back.    In the balance    The right-wing regime that replaced the Morales regime has quickly become unpopular as Bolivia’s economy suffers during the coronavirus pandemic.      Luis Arce, former economic minister to Morales, won the presidency in a landslide, restoring the socialist government to power; last month, the exiled Morales made a triumphant return to Bolivia.      Now, many things hang in the balance, including crypto.      Alberto Bonadona, senior economist and emeritus professor at Universidad Mayor de San Andrés (UMSA) in Bolivia told CoinDesk the current government is unlikely to reverse the crypto ban.      “All these kinds of cryptocurrencies are not quite welcome in Bolivia,” Bonadona said.      Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are still widely viewed with skepticism in Bolivia, and adoption is slow compared to other Latin American countries like Mexico or Venezuela.      Although Blacutt doesn’t believe he’s in any real danger, the return of the socialist government, he said, may put crypto enthusiasts in a “difficult position.”      But a growing community of advocates including Bolivian software engineers, entrepreneurs and developers are determined to change the government’s position.      Even though policy remains unchanged, sentiment may be changing, albeit slowly. The interim government that came to power after Morales’ exit did not lift the ban, but the blockchain community visibly grew this year. Bolivian users only traded a monthly average of $21,330 on peer-to-peer exchange Paxful, but the platform saw a 570% increase in trading volume compared to 2019, while new user registrations went up by 230%.      LocalBitcoins saw over 450% growth in trading volumes between January and September 2020, recording an all-time daily high of $17,000 on Sept. 2.    Why ban crypto?    In 2014, Bolivian software engineer Gabriela Melendrez was writing her undergraduate thesis on blockchain technology when the country’s central bank (BCB) issued the directive banning the use of “any kind of currency that is not issued and controlled by a government or an authorized entity.”      The directive was the first of its kind from a South American nation, and named a range of virtual currencies including bitcoin, namecoin, devcoin, quark and others as currencies that “do not belong to any state, country or economic zone” because they can cause losses to their holders.      Melendrez interviewed BCB personnel following the ban.      “The resolution was born to protect the population against pyramid schemes, Ponzi schemes and things like that. That was the answer they gave me,” Melendrez told CoinDesk via Telegram.      The 2017 statement by the ASFI reminded the citizens of Bolivia that this type of activity is prohibited across the nation because they may seek to trick Bolivians into losing their money and savings.      The central bank did not respond to requests for comment by press time. CoinDesk received a bounce-back from the ASFI email address a week after initially reaching out.      Blacutt confirmed the government was nervous about scams and the use of cryptocurrencies to fund criminal activities. But that was only part of the story.      The BCB statement also said the ban is necessary to ensure the stability and purchasing power of the national currency, the boliviano.      When the socialist government came to power in October, the country’s foreign reserves fell to a record low, the lowest in 13 years, down $1.3 billion since September. Wealthy Bolivians had begun sending money abroad, fearing President Arce’s promised wealth tax on millionaires.      Cryptocurrencies “could help people to take money out of the economy. Right now, they're trying to stop that,” Bonadona said.    An uneasy fit    When systems engineer Alvaro Guzman first heard about bitcoin back in 2013, he stayed up all night discussing the possible applications of blockchain in Bolivia.      “The first area I saw is, of course, an alternative to traditional banking. The second and very interesting area of development is on transparency,” Guzman told CoinDesk, citing claims of fraud that surrounded Morales’ fourth-term election last year, which led to his eventual resignation.      Guzman suggested that blockchain-based banking and cryptocurrencies can offer a viable alternative to traditional financial services in the country for a number of reasons, one being its high unbanked population.      According to World Bank statistics, in 2017, 46% of Bolivian adults did not have a bank account while only 7% of adults had a credit card. For comparison, 29% of Venezuelan adults claimed to own a credit card in 2017.      Bolivia has a very large, informal economy that is not taxed or regulated by the government, Guzman said. In fact, it is the largest informal economy in the world, according to the International Monetary Fund.      While a cash-driven economy and large unbanked population are driving crypto adoption in Mexico, Bolivia doesn’t seem to be showing the same momentum or interest in digital assets.      Bonadona said the government and most Bolivians still view bitcoin as an instrument for speculation as opposed to a reserve or currency that can be used for international transactions.      In Bolivia, Bonadona added, speculative investment instruments are not all the rage. According to the 2020 Investment Climate Statement by the U.S. Department of State, the Bolivian stock exchange (BBV) is very small, with more than 95% of transactions concentrated in bonds and debt instruments.      “There is the idea that basically this is a bubble and somehow, in some time, it will explode and won't do any good for anybody who invested in it,” Bonadona said.    Persistent advocates    Although it may have looked like an outright ban on the usage of crypto, Blacutt and Guzman agree that the 2014 central bank directive did not ban owning or trading crypto on exchanges, but only limited paying for goods and services with cryptocurrencies (hence keeping it out of circulation) and prohibited banks from transacting with them.      The ban is very specific in saying that Bolivia is not allowing commercial transactions using a currency that's not issued by the central bank, Guzman said, adding that he can’t go out and buy a burger or a car with bitcoin.      “But that's the only thing that they have written in the law. … The problem is that in practice, if you promote bitcoin, they can arrest you,” Blacutt said.      Despite the ban, and the authorities’ somewhat haphazard interpretation of it, blockchain believers powered ahead through the Morales regime and seemed undeterred by the Socialist party’s return to power.      “Technology is always one step ahead of legislation,” Guzman said.      After the ban was implemented, crypto enthusiasts formed networks that traded in cash underground, making themselves invisible to the government, Guzman added.      According to blockchain developer Huascar Miranda Martinez, few Bolivians trade on peer-to-peer platforms like LocalBitcoins and even less use exchanges like Binance (where they are not allowed to trade with a Bolivian credit card), although that number is slowly growing. People mostly trade bitcoin in person to avoid interactions with banks: Buyers and sellers agree on prices in WhatsApp groups or other social media networks, and meet at restaurants or cafes to exchange bitcoin wallet addresses for cash.      “The bank prohibition is not a problem for us. It’s a problem for the bank,” Martinez said.      To avoid getting flagged by banks, Guzman said people are now careful about how much money they transfer from wallets or exchanges, and make sure banks are not used in a way that breaks the law.      “Basically, the only thing that the bank can do is say, hey, you’re getting $70,000? Who sent this money? How did you get it? And depending on the response, and the amount, the bank can follow up with an investigation and look for the source,” Guzman said.    Road to adoption    Boliviais in recession, compounded by the COVID-19 health crisis. Its economy is projected to contract by 7.3% this year, according to the World Bank. Although the pandemic’s economic fallout is driving crypto adoption in countries like Nigeria, where a tech-savvy population is increasingly using bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, in Bolivia people still seem to prefer physical assets like jewelry or cash.      Guzman says this may have to do with a lack of knowledge of digital currency. Even if Bolivians buy things online, people still end up paying in cash, Guzman said, either on delivery or using a third party.      Bolivia’s blockchain activists aim to communicate with both the people and the government, helping them understand the broader applications of blockchain technology, Melendrez said.      Melendrez works with various crypto projects and founded Bolivian Mind Blockchain, a platform for learning and sharing knowledge about the technology.      “Nowadays we are working on education and presenting projects that could help our society understand the technology,” Melendrez said.      She eventually met Guzman, who was hosting meetings over beer to talk about community interest in cryptocurrencies. Lately, and more urgently, Guzman has been meeting with former lawmakers and experts to find ways to open a discussion with the government.      Meanwhile, blockchain projects are slowly coming out of the woodwork: A Bolivian cattle ranch is to be tokenized so investors can trade physical assets digitally, and a blockchain advocate Carlos Rodrigo, has created a gold tokenization project.      “I want to launch the project, and use that to show the government how we can raise capital in order to expand natural resources in our country with the private sector,” Rodrigo said.      Rodrigo is hopeful the government will reverse the ban. Eventually, he said, “they’re going to do it.”      UPDATE (Dec. 8, 2020, 15:27 UTC): CoinDesk received a bounce-back from the ASFI's email address a week after initially reaching out.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/12/04/bolivia-essentially-banned-crypto-but-blockchain-advocates-are-pushing-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b841df9309e60df781bf99f3366f8e378be0238f-1920x1369.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Digital-asset traders have been speculating whether prices would quickly breach $20,000 after the cryptocurrency surged earlier this week to a new all-time high of $19,920. But so far the market hasn't been able to carry through.      ""In the short run, this rally has endured for a good while and prices might need some sideways action or even a quick retracement before rising further,"" the digital-asset financial firm Diginex wrote Friday.

Total daily trading volume on OKEx declined significantly during the same time period – down approximately 67.7% from Nov. 25, according to data compiled by CoinDesk. The volume of tether traded on OKEx plunged 70%.      The sudden and significant decline in tether in reserves on OKEx could indicate that users are transferring their stablecoins elsewhere – possibly to a different exchange or to their private cold wallets, according to analysts and traders who spoke with CoinDesk.      “They don’t want to keep assets in OKEx,"" Darius Sit, of Singapore-based QCP Capital, told CoinDesk.      - Muyao Shen      Read More: OKEx’s Trading Volumes and Tether Reserve Plunge on Possible User Exodus    Bitcoin watch    Bloomberg analysts expect bitcoin to remain bid next year and possibly rise as high as $50,000 next year.

RAKIB sent a letter to Bank of Russia Chairwoman Elvira Nabiullina saying the potential design for the ""digital ruble"" favored by the regulator will return the Russian economy to the Soviet model, when all the financial activities were managed in a centralized way, according to a report in the Russian newspaper Kommersant on Friday.      RAKIB said that even the China's DCEP model, where the banks are in charge of individual digital yuan accounts, is more market-friendly and stimulates competition between banks. The Bank of Russia, on the contrary, seems to lean toward a model in which it will be the only issuer of the digital rubles, with all the accounts in a centralized system on which banks will offer products.      In such case, the retail banks will not be able to add the digital ruble accounts of their clients to existing balance sheets, and there is a chance retail users will leave the banks for a centralized digital ruble platform, RAKIB's advisory board member Vladislav Martynov told Kommersant.      According to the Bank of Russia's concept, the digital ruble will not be a replacement to bank accounts or physical cash but a third form of money in Russia, which will exist in parallel with the other two.      The letter by RAKIB echoed the sentiment expressed earlier by some of Russia's banks and financial market players, which are concerned that if the Bank of Russia chooses the centralized model retail banks will be put at a disadvantage. Banks will have to compete with the regulator for clients' deposits while also having to spend their own resources on the digital ruble integration into the economy, experts said.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/04/russias-crypto-community-fears-digital-ruble-plan-means-back-to-ussr,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da2501fb663fbf31835ea4429a18e6d25b2dcdec-1500x914.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Dec. 2, a Twitter user asked the CTO, “If Nodes, validators and the community at large got together and we agree that it's better for the community to burn the 50 billion XRP Ripple has in escrows would that be possible?”  Responding to the tweet, David Schwartz implied that majority rule would win in such a decision. ""Yes. There would be nothing Ripple could do to stop that from happening. Public blockchains are very democratic. If the majority wants a rules change, there is nothing the minority can do to stop them,"" Schwartz commented in response.  Ripple’s XRP sales have been declining after Ripple stopped selling tokens to exchanges. The escrow account held approximately 48.9 billion tokens at the start of 2020.  As there are currently 45.3 billion tokens in circulation, a sudden release of a sizable portion of those escrowed tokens could cause the price of XRP to plunge.

According to a report released on Thursday by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, digital assets are a ""particularly good example"" of both benefits and potential risks associated with innovation.      The report highlighted the ambitions by nations around the world in their experiments with central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as a way to ""enhance the global standing of their own currencies and enable faster payments.""      ""Financial Innovation offers considerable benefits to consumers,"" the report reads. However, the report also noted that should stablecoins become widely adopted as a form of payment it could upset the balance of the current financial system, warranting ""greater regulatory scrutiny.""      The Council is charged with identifying risks to the financial stability of the U.S. and encourages market discipline while responding to threats facing the U.S. financial system. The council is comprised of 10 voting members and five nonvoting members who amalgamate expertise of federal financial regulators, state regulators and an independent insurance expert appointed by the U.S. president, according to the Treasury Department's website.      E-commerce companies providing financial services, such as Square (SQ) and PayPal (PYPL) , could increasingly seek to compete directly with incumbent financial service providers. ""Their market presence could grow significantly,"" according to the report. That these companies are not regulated in the same way ""incumbent financial service providers are required to comply"" is a matter of concern, the council said.      See also: ‘It’s Something We’re Studying’: Deputy Treasury Secretary Discusses US CBDC Plans      It also noted that financial stability could be upset if financial institutions outsourced ""critical services"" from third-party providers where operational failures may disrupt the activities of ""multiple financial institutions or financial markets.""      As such, the council recommended regulators kept a ""proactive"" approach in identifying new financial products and services as well as encouraging ""relevent authorities"" to evaluate the effects those services could have on the status quo.

Stripe, which processes payments for online businesses and e-commerce platforms, will soon allow its customers to offer insured, interest-bearing bank accounts, debit cards and other cash-management services.  Stripe's offerings are designed for the merchants and vendors that do business with Stripe’s customers, and are not retail focused.  With its new offerings, Stripe is following other digital banks such as Square’s Cash App and Chime Financial, which have become popular by offering alternatives to checking accounts. Citigroup has also partnered with Google, which will allow its users to open checking and savings accounts through the Google Pay app.  Stripe, however, is focusing on automating business banking, specifically for platforms that have ties to other businesses, the WSJ said.  “If you are a Goldman Sachs or a Citi or one of these firms, you are watching the fact that new businesses live their lives online,” said John Collison, Stripe’s co-founder and president, told the WSJ.  Canadian e-commerce company Shopify is an early adopter and already uses Stripe’s banking services for its Shopify Balance. Starting early next year, will offer Shopify Balance accounts to thousands of merchants that use its software.
