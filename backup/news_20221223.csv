6258820,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513564,1671836452,"Ethereum Stalls At $1,200, Why Bears Still Have The Upper Hand","Ethereum is still closely mirroring the price of bitcoin through the bear market and that has seen its price basically stall in the last day in tandem with BTC. ETH’s price is presently resting just above $1,200, and while this would have served as a good bounce-off point for the digital asset, it shows no signs of doing so. Ethereum Price Stuck At $1,200 Given the current market circumstances, Ethereum at $1,200 presents one of the best prices that the market will see for the digital asset before 2022 runs out. The momentum in the market was already on a decline but the 49% jump in Ethereum’s trading volume in the last day put a perhaps temporary stop to that decline. Short-term indicators pointing towards sell points to this being temporary. Now, for the lull in price, it can be explained by ETH’s price sitting so close to the 20-day moving average of $1,247. Since there isn’t much movement in the market, it makes sense that the digital asset would only try to maintain its price at just above $1,200 at this time.

Although cryptocurrencies did not fall like the stock market following the release of the US GDP data on Thursday, it definitely hindered any growth from taking place in the market. ETH price struggling at $1,200 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com Why Is ETH Struggling? Ethereum has received some bad press over the last couple of days. One of the most prominent was when the Paxful peer-to-peer exchange announced that it was delisting Ethereum. CEO Ray Youssef presented the reason as “Integrity over revenue” as the exchange believes that the network was not decentralized. This stoked fears that had previously subsided following the move to proof of stake. For many, this move made Ethereum much easier to control and Youssef said, “One day you will need permission to use it.” Related Reading: Exchange Inflows, Outflows At A Stalemate As Bitcoin Refuses To Budge Given this, the price of ETH has buckled under the pressure of the FUD it created. If bulls are unable to hold the $1,200 support, then it could send the digital asset into free fall, with no significant support until $1,140. The cryptocurrency is already headed for a close below its year-to-date peak but a close below $1,200 would see it start the new year with a very bearish outlook. ETH is trading at $1,224 at the time of this writing, according to data from Coinmarketcap. It is up 0.64% in the last 24 hours and boasts a market cap of $149.8 billion.

42413341,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8RAQ,1671832556,Crypto Markets Today: Bitcoin Ends Penultimate Week of (Awful) 2022 on Quiet Note,"The year 2022 is likely to go down as one of the worst ever in the blockchain industry’s volatile history. But for scammers trolling digital-asset markets for suckers or even easy pickings from savvy crypto traders, it’s been a banner year.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  A new report from blockchain risk monitoring firm Solidus Labs shows that fraudsters deployed over 117,000 scam tokens from Jan. 1 to Dec. 1, 2022, a 41% increase over the full 2021.  The study also revealed that 8% of all Ethereum tokens are programmed to execute rug pulls, while 12% of all BNB Chain tokens are alleged to be scams.  According to Solidus Labs, many of the scammers behind these tokens use crypto-to-fiat exchanges to both seed their scams and launder their proceeds.  “These fraudsters – benefiting from the fact that more than 99% of their malicious tokens have evaded detection under traditional approaches to scam identification – deposited and withdrew a combined $11 billion worth of ETH to/from 153 different centralized finance [CeFi] exchanges during the time period we studied,” the report read.  The scam tokens deployed in 2022 brings the total since September 2020 to more than 200,000, based on the tally by Solidus Labs. Almost 2 million investors have lost funds to rug pull tokens.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Strong Economic Data Is Bad News For Bitcoin Bulls  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Our thoughts on bitcoin’s chart are relatively unchanged from our thoughts a week ago. Momentum is fairly stagnant, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading remaining in fairly neutral territory.  Past trading activity shows significant price agreement between $16,500 and $17,000. When agreement exists to this extent, prices can remain at that level for an extended period of time. This is compounded by the decline in volume that is emblematic of year end trading.  Bitcoin is currently trading fairly tightly to its 20-day moving average, and appears poised to remain there for the time being. Ether’s chart implies an almost identical situation, which is unsurprising given its persistently tight correlation with bitcoin.  Read the full technical take here.

As the year draws to close, investors remain on the sidelines, staying away from risky bets amid growing fears over the Federal Reserve's rate hike path. In what is widely called the ""2022 crypto winter"", bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been lagging the S&P 500 by a wide margin. After notching a new record of ~$69K in November 2021, it slumped to as low as ~$15.6K this year after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ). According to AFP data , total crypto market cap sank from ~$3T in November 2021 to a little over $8.1B this week. The crypto market cap currently stands at $810.46B, up 0.19% over Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap . ""From a financial perspective, 2022 will be remembered as a year where almost all bad things that could happen, did,"" said Matrixport U.S. CEO Anthony DeMartino . ""We still feel confident in the core themes and prospects that got us excited coming out of COVID, but with perhaps a more realistic approach to valuations and opportunities."" FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried has now been placed under house arrest after being released on a $250M bail. His associates Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang pled guilty to federal criminal fraud charges . The resulting fallout led to ramped up scrutiny in the industry. Crypto firms are on notice to start operating more like regulated securities companies as SEC chair Gary Gensler said ""the runway is getting shorter"" to start following rules. Companies that audit crypto firms are also under the SEC scanner as their proof of reserve reports do not establish that an entity has enough assets to cover its liabilities. Meanwhile, Brazil signed a bill to regulate the use of cryptos. The bill recognizes crypto as a payment method and investment, but may not be regarded as legal tender. In company news this week, Core Scientific ( CORZ ) shares sank to as low as 5 cents apiece after the bitcoin miner filed for bankruptcy . But it recovered slightly after it reportedly received court approval for a $37.5M bankruptcy loan. ""The miner's shares are poised to rally, which shows investors believe in the restructuring support agreement and are still willing to invest in some distressed parts of the cryptoverse,"" said OANDA analyst Edward Moya. Bankrupt brokerage Voyager Digital ( OTCPK:VYGVQ ) selected Binance.US's bid for its assets . Binance.US is said to be weighing other opportunities to acquire assets of troubled crypto firms. Bitcoin price Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was up 0.1% at $16.81K at 4.37 pm ET, while ether ( ETH-USD ) inched 0.3% higher at $1.22K. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) traded in the $16K-$17K range over the past week.

42413324,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8QwO,1671830057,Binance Failing to Get US Exchange Listings for BNB Is Yellow Flag for Crypto Analysts,"Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange by trading volume, has been the focus of crypto-market speculation in recent weeks after blockchain watchers detected billions of dollars of deposit outflows, the company’s auditor begged off and reports emerged the company might be under investigation by U.S. authorities.  Such anxieties are clearly reflected in the recent downward trajectory for Binance’s in-house token, BNB: The price has tumbled about 17% this month to $245, vastly underperforming the broad CoinDesk Market Index of digital assets, which is down 5.7%. At the peak in May 2021, BNB changed hands at $690, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The token’s market capitalization has dropped to around $40 billion, from a record $116 billion at one point last year.  At the core of the concerns is whether Binance might be prone to a loss of confidence similar to November’s stunningly swift unraveling of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange. And it’s impossible to ignore that the first signs of deep distress at FTX emerged when that exchange’s own FTT token started to plunge.  So as crypto analysts home in on BNB token’s valuation, they’re scrutinizing the FTT token’s arc for any red – or yellow – flags that, in hindsight, might have tipped investors off to the market’s fragility. And a key similarity stands out: Just as FTX’s FTT token had mostly failed to get listed on major U.S. crypto exchanges, so is BNB absent from a large number of U.S. exchanges. (It is listed on Binance.US.)  Some crypto analysts speculate that major U.S. exchanges might have steered clear of a BNB listing for fear of running afoul of regulators. Any issues on the regulatory front could also represent a risk for holders of the token.  “Exchanges probably do not list BNB as they see it as a security given the centralization of their network,” said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, in an interview with CoinDesk. “It's probably not worth U.S. exchanges risking listing a security especially if it's a competitor's token.”  FTT gets designated as a security  The risk was underscored this week when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission labeled FTX’s FTT token as a security in a complaint.  The document pointed to the existence of FTT's ""buy-and-burn"" program as an example of how the token might be intended to serve as an investment. Such programs might be compared to a stock buyback, where companies redeem their own shares from the open market to reduce the outstanding supply and thus to increase their value.  Binance also offers a burn program, introduced in late 2021, labeled “BNB Burn,” and detailed on its website and updated as recently as Oct. 13.  “BNB is a deflationary currency, which means that it maintains a stable value through burning its tokens throughout the year,” the website reads.  According to Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, BNB is likely not listed on most domestic exchanges due to the fact it could be “deemed a security by regulators.”  CoinDesk asked Binance for a comment on the lack of BNB token listings on major U.S. exchanges besides Binance.US, and also if executives at the firm were worried that it might be deemed a security. No response was received as of press time. In an earlier communication, the representative noted that BNB was listed on several major crypto exchanges outside the U.S.  What the exchanges say  According to Binance's website, ""BNB is the cryptocurrency coin that powers the BNB Chain ecosystem.""  ""As one of the world's most popular utility tokens, not only can you trade BNB like any other cryptocurrency, you can also use BNB in a wide range of applications and use cases,"" the website reads.  In terms of utility of the token, BNB can be used ""to pay for goods and services, settle transaction fees on Binance Smart Chain, participate in exclusive token sales and more,"" according to the site. A yellow button at the bottom of the web page reads, ""Buy BNB Now."" Clicking that leads to another web page where a user can log in to Binance or sign up for an account.  According to CoinGecko, the digital-asset markets pricing site, BNB is listed on tens of crypto exchanges, including KuCoin, Huobi and OKX.  The U.S. exchange Kraken lists over 120 tokens but does not offer BNB to its customers.  A Kraken spokesperson said to CoinDesk that “Kraken is an agnostic player in the crypto market” and that it “has a robust asset selection and listing procedure that ensures assets receive the analysis and vetting they deserve, which includes a rigorous compliance, legal and security process.”  A representative for Coinbase, which also has not listed BNB, told CoinDesk, ""If we haven’t listed a popular asset yet, it is likely due to various reasons which may include: We have concluded that the asset does not meet our listing standards, we do not have enough information about the asset, additional technical integration work is required, or we do not support the network for the given token standard.”  “BNB certainly is not in a position of strength, which will likely continue as thorny questions regarding Binance remain,” wrote Collin Howe, derivatives trader at B2C2 in a Friday note.",NEGATIVE,BNB | FTT,EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB | FTT | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/23/crypto-analysts-see-yellow-flag-in-us-exchanges-refusal-to-list-binances-bnb-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ca1355aa1934adc88adf820a9dce69c30c1d5f7-623x327.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413323,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8QvS,1671829564,Blockware Solutions Customer Accuses Bitcoin Mining Firm of Fraud,"Bitcoin mining equipment and hosting provider Blockware Solutions was accused by a customer in a lawsuit of breach of contract, negligence, deceptive trade practices and fraud.  The case, filed in U.S. federal court in the Northern District of Illinois on Dec. 17, centers around an allegation that Blockware sold Faes & Co. 50 mining rigs for $525,000. But, Faes said in the lawsuit, “Blockware did not actually own or operate a facility to host the miners and was not capable of doing so reliably.” Also, the facilities owned by third parties that Blockware could tap didn’t have reliable power, resulting in subpar service, according to the suit.  “As a result, Faes’ miners under Blockware’s management and control have experienced prolonged downtime and inoperability due to lack of power, resulting in significant loss of revenue,” Faes argued. Faes said it has suffered at least $250,000 of damages.  London-based Faes said it ordered the machines to be delivered and hosted in Blockware’s own facilities in January, when bitcoin mining was highly profitable amid a bull market. The rigs only came online in April, Faes said. The machines were running with 70% uptime on average as of October, as opposed to the advertised 100%, Faes said.  Operational issues, according to Faes, started as soon as the machines were online, which eventually become “nonoperational” in October. Prior to the machines going offline, Blockware was claiming 100% uptime on a 90-day status page, including for a facility in Pennsylvania, where Faes’ rigs were located, often not working, according to the lawsuit.  “We disagree with all statements and claims” in the lawsuit, Blockware CEO Mason Japp told CoinDesk. “We are confident it will be tossed out from the court, we have honestly served this industry for over 5.5 years and this has been [the] first filed lawsuit against us.”  Blockware is at least the second retail-facing mining company to be accused of operational problems this year. In July, both the CEO and the chief financial officer of Compass Mining resigned following a series of “setbacks and disappointments,” such as delays in machine deployment deploying machines and several thousand rigs being stranded in Russia following sanctions on its hosting partner in that country.

The company has a plan to potentially operate after debt restructuring. But the plan requires BTC spot pricing to never fall again, and is going to massively dilute current shareholders (at best). The sustained downturn in risk assets in 2022 has wreaked havoc on a wide variety of stocks and other financial instruments. One of those is certainly Bitcoin (BTC-USD), which is down 64% this year, and that has destroyed the share prices of the companies that (attempt to) make their living via mining the world’s largest digital currency. I’m not aware of a Bitcoin miner with a higher share price this year, but the declines of some have certainly been worse than others. In what has become the poster child for the downfall of crypto mining, Core Scientific ( CORZ ) has filed for bankruptcy protection . Core is the largest crypto miner by capacity, so it theoretically should have had all the advantages over competitors. However, far too much leverage, combined with a downturn in Bitcoin prices, led to its demise and a share price of less than a dime. The last time I covered Core, it was the “sell” portion of a Bitcoin miner pairs trade. The stock was $2.02 at the time, and has fallen 95% since then. I noted at the time that Core was far too leveraged, and the idea was that if there was going to be a prolonged bear market in Bitcoin (turns out that’s what we’ve gotten), those with too much leverage would suffer most. Here we are, and Core has now filed for bankruptcy protections. So what do we do now? Before we take a look at Core’s situation, I want to stress that a stock with a $33 million market cap, a share price of 9 or 10 cents, and a recent bankruptcy filing is subject to extreme volatility. The very existence of Core is currently up for grabs, as we’ll see below, and that means there’s a high likelihood of the current equity value going to zero, or close to it. The headline of what I’m about to show you is that I do not think it is prudent to take any positions in this stock given the volatility. If you’ve been shorting Core, you should congratulate yourself, take your profits, and move on. On the other side, I cannot see how this will work out for equity holders that pay even 10 cents per share. As far as I can tell, Core is either going to actually go out of business if Bitcoin continues to fall, or at best, current equity holders will be so diluted that even 10 cents will look expensive. With all of this in mind, I’ll reiterate my suggestion that you think long and hard before doing anything with this stock. I always start my analysis with a chart, as I primarily use technical analysis for my own trading. However, with a bankruptcy filing in place, the chart is meaningless. We’ll therefore skip that and move right to the financing discussion, as that’s far more relevant in this case. How did we get here? The short answer is that Core financed itself as though the good times would never end in terms of Bitcoin pricing. The company wanted to become the largest Bitcoin miner, and it has done so. However, the cost of doing that has proven too much to bear, and we have a bankruptcy filing. The economics of Bitcoin mining have deteriorated significantly in 2022, which I lay out in the linked article above from June. I won’t waste the space here to go through it again but suffice it to say that while the price of Bitcoin has fallen and fallen and fallen, the difficult of getting Bitcoin has gone higher and higher and higher. That’s a very bad combination, and it has led to the share prices of Bitcoin miners being decimated. Core posted an investor update on its bankruptcy filing in the week before Christmas, which provides a fairly detailed roadmap of what the company believes is going to occur going forward. Investor presentation You can give this a read but basically, the company’s bankruptcy filing is because it can no longer make debt servicing payments to its lenders. That means it’s in default, and that means it needs a bankruptcy filing. There was far too much miner expansion (financed by debt) in the face of higher difficulty to mine and lower Bitcoin prices. Combine those factors for months on end, and you have an insolvent company. Now, the company has a debtor-in-possession, or DIP, facility of $75 million in place. Existing holders of convertible notes will turn their debt into equity in the reorganized company, and holders of general unsecured claims will get common stock and warrants in the reorganized company. What that means is that creditors of various types are going to get “significant” portions of equity in the reorganized company. In practice, that means current equity holders will almost certainly be diluted to the point where even if one owned all outstanding shares of Core today, that investor would have a small minority stake in the company after reorganization. Let that sink in. This is the risk of buying a company that is in the process of reorganizing; current shareholders are going to be diluted enormously as the company reorganizes its debt into equity. Management says the cash generated from operations, as well as the debt-for-equity swaps, should provide enough cash to emerge from bankruptcy some time in 2023. But in no way does that mean today’s share price is some sort of bargain; the company has said current investors are going to be diluted enormously to rid the company’s balance sheet of the unsustainable amount of debt it possesses. Core says, for what it’s worth, that if it were debt-free, its miners would be “significantly” cash flow positive. That implies that if this plan works, Core could theoretically fund its own operations one day. We’ll see, but I’ll say again that this does not mean current equity holders would see a benefit by riding out the bankruptcy process. Capital structure woes Obviously, the company’s bankruptcy filing means its capital structure was, let’s say, suboptimal. Let’s take a look at the updated capital structure from the company’s filing. Investor presentation There is just $30 million of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet, and $908 million of debt of various types. One thing for those looking to “bargain hunt” with the current equity to notice, is that there is $552 million of convertible notes that the company has told us are going to be converted into new equity. The current market cap is $33 million, so you can do the math on what equity holders are likely to have at the end of this. The ultimate amount of equity these convertible note holders receives is up for grabs, but it’s unlikely to be the full face value. Even so, a 50% discount would still be $226 million, or about seven times the current market cap. This is why I was urging extreme caution when trying to buy this stock; people that buy today are likely to be left with little to nothing after the restructuring. For what it’s worth, Core says it will not sell any more equipment, and that it should be virtually debt-free after the restructuring. Those things should allow it to operate itself with cash generated from mining and selling Bitcoins. That argues that the company could survive in some form after the restructuring. That’s good news for employees that want to keep their jobs, but that does not change the outlook for buying the stock today. As I see it, buyers of the stock today have two possible outcomes. Either the restructuring doesn’t work and the company goes out of business, or the restructuring works and equity holders are diluted six or eight or 12 times the current float. The net outcome for the current stock is almost the same in either case, and that is extremely poor returns from the current share price. The company provided a handy 13-week cash flow forecast, the assumptions of which you can see below. Investor presentation Now, with those in mind, we can look at the actual cash inflows and outlays to get a sense of what Core thinks is on the near-term horizon. Apologies for the eye chart; you can click to make it larger. Investor presentation The company expects ~$10 million in monthly hosting revenues, and ~$25 million in monthly Bitcoin revenue from coins mined and sold. The assumed price is $15k per coin, so there’s upside and downside risk to this forecast depending upon what happens with spot prices. Importantly, net cash flow is still expected to be negative, so this is why Core filed for bankruptcy. Power and operating costs alone eat up essentially all of its revenue. Looking further out, here’s what Core thinks it can achieve after restructuring. Investor presentation It expects something like 65 BTC mined each day, which would equate to about $1.1 million of daily revenue. It also expects a flat number of miners deployed, as well as essentially flat earnings for the foreseeable future. Now, just like the cash flow forecast, these numbers have upside and downside risk from BTC spot prices. If the bear market persists and BTC goes to $10k or something like that, we’ll see huge risk to these numbers. If it goes back to $30k or $40k, Core stands to do very well with its reorganized structure. Regardless, keep in mind that current equity holders will have very little (if any) participation in any of this under the terms of the restructuring deal. Finally, let’s take a look at the liquidity schedule going forward. Again, click to enlarge, or go to page 34 in the investor presentation to view for yourself. Investor presentation The bottom line here is that at $16.5k in Bitcoin price, Core believes it can just scrape by in terms of operating sustainably going forward. It expects it can produce a run rate of $50 million to $55 million in total monthly revenue longer term, but that operating costs will be roughly the same. I’ll invite those looking to buy this stock to zoom in on the stock-based compensation line as well; the company is forecasting ~$5 million per month in SBC going forward indefinitely. Remember the current market cap is $33 million. The bottom line If you’re still with me, it means you’ve seen loud and clear that I do not think buying this stock is in any form a good idea. Based upon what I see, it is my belief that it is quite likely that this stock is going to trade very close to zero once the restructuring plan comes to fruition, or potentially even before that. I simply don’t see a path forward for current buyers of the stock, and I certainly recommend that if you own this for some reason, you take the money today, as quickly as you can, and never look back. I DO NOT condone trying to short this stock, even though I’m saying it is likely to lose most or all of its current value. If you could even find someone to lend you shares, the costs of doing so, and the risk of a short-term squeeze higher are far too great for the reward. Core has the chance to emerge from this as a company that can actually fund itself going forward. This is particularly true if BTC spot pricing rises significantly. The opposite is true as well, if BTC spot pricing falls further, Core may go out of business even after restructuring. If you’re looking to own a piece of the new company, I strongly suggest you wait until the reorganization is done, and look to purchase the “new” company. Buyers today are going to be diluted into oblivion, according to the plan, and I therefore think it’s best to just stay away.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4566220-core-scientific-stock-a-sell?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6250847.jpeg

The tendency to look for patterns where there are none is helpful in the wild: It’s better to see illusory predators than to miss the ones that are out to kill you. When it comes to thinking clearly, however, it has its drawbacks.  Association fallacies are everywhere. From a red herring in a debate to the guilt-by-association that smears public figures, association fallacies skew your strongest-held opinions. At best, it’s why you dislike a rival quarterback. But more seriously it’s the nightmare fuel that allows otherwise reasonable people to resist social, political and technological progress.  Pat Duffy is the co-founder of The Giving Block. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023.  Crypto has been more victimized by association fallacies in recent history than any other technology – scandals including Mt. Gox, Bitconnect and now Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX taint a whole industry, whatever its part in the catastrophe. Take the instinct to see nefarious patterns where they don’t exist and combine it with default bias (preferring the devil you know to the devil you don’t) and you begin to see why the adoption curve for cryptocurrency is so fragile.  Read more: David Z. Morris - There's Less Money in Crypto, and That's a Good Thing  In 2021, crypto was at an all-time high and it finally felt like people were starting to see crypto as a force for good. Now, one bad actor is on the verge of undoing more than a decade of Web3 progress. The actions of one have overshadowed the incredible impact that crypto has had on society, and the number of lives that it has saved since its inception.  Crypto has saved people suffering from the fiat crisis in Lebanon, Venezuela and China – providing a way for the average person to buy food, water and medical supplies necessary to survive. Crypto is sparking crucial conversations around banking the unbanked and empowering women in places such as Afghanistan to control their own financial accounts without male guardians.  In the charitable sector, crypto is one of the fastest-growing donation methods, with the most generous donors of any investment community. Blockchain-based decentralized IDs are saving refugees from losing their life savings or being separated from their families. Crypto is leading the way on privacy and transparency simultaneously, shielding human rights advocates from retribution by tyrannical regimes, while creating a fully transparent Bitcoin blockchain that has lived for more than a decade without a single record being altered.  FTX was bad. But crypto is one of the greatest forces for good on the planet. If we allow the narrative to continue on this path, the association fallacy will snowball, systematically erasing any memory of more than a decade’s worth of positive crypto impact. So, what can we do about it?  Stop hiding  We can start by abandoning this strategy of sticking our heads in the sand and waiting for this to blow over. Talk to anyone in crypto right now and they’re in a holding pattern. Everyone’s worried about putting their foot in their mouth, so the only stories people see are negative stories about former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and FTX. This might be a good strategy for not putting our feet in our mouths, but it’s not doing anything about the feet that are kicking us while we’re down. If you’re not speaking up right now you’re a part of the problem.  Say something  Continue showcasing all of the good that crypto is doing around the world. Typically, the holiday season is full of heartfelt stories about the impact of crypto. Crypto is still saving lives every single day, but those stories aren’t being told the same way they were prior to FTX’s collapse. If the crypto community can come together to tell these stories they are less likely to be forgotten.  Do something  It’s one thing to discuss the positive impact that crypto has made on the world, it’s another to put your money where your mouth is and use your crypto for good. Though crypto philanthropy is such a small part of the crypto story, its impact has been felt globally. You don’t have to donate much, but every single donation shows the world that crypto can make real, tangible changes to this world.  From our side, at The Giving Block we’re going well beyond that, starting “The Crypto is Good Project,” which will focus on compiling data, profiles and reports on the ways in which crypto is a force for good. If you’re in crypto, now is the time to take a little time and build a use case that matters.  If the crypto community seizes this moment to shed light on the bright side of crypto, we’ll put FTX behind us and go back to changing the world. If we don’t, people will continue to look at us and see SBF. That’s our choice right now.

The study also revealed that 8% of all Ethereum tokens are programmed to execute rug pulls, while 12% of all BNB Chain tokens are alleged to be scams.  According to Solidus Labs, many of the scammers behind these tokens use crypto-to-fiat exchanges to both seed their scams and launder their proceeds.  “These fraudsters – benefiting from the fact that more than 99% of their malicious tokens have evaded detection under traditional approaches to scam identification – deposited and withdrew a combined $11 billion worth of ETH to/from 153 different centralized finance [CeFi] exchanges during the time period we studied,” the report read.  The scam tokens deployed in 2022 brings the total since September 2020 to more than 200,000, based on the tally by Solidus Labs. Almost 2 million investors have lost funds to rug pull tokens.  Hidden theft  One common scheme is known as the “rug pull” and involves “creating a token, funding the liquidity pool and then removing all the liquidity after an initial rush of people buy the token,” as described by Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.  But why have the majority of rug pulls gone undetected in the past, and why aren’t these tokens counted on crypto pricing sites that mostly put the number of digital assets in existence at around 20,000?  Solidus Labs Chief Operating Officer Chen Arad pointed out that not all tokens deployed on blockchains are listed on pricing data sites because they’re not verified.  The number of cryptocurrencies tracked by data tracker CoinMarketCap reached over 22,000 as of today, but many existing tokens didn’t meet the site’s listing guidelines. They may still be featured on the site as untracked listings or unverified listings, including over 145,000 Ethereum ERC-20 tokens and 1.2 million BNB Chain BEP-20 tokens.  Arad told CoinDesk in an emailed comment that the report’s data is based on “continuously scanning smart contracts as they’re deployed on blockchains and flagging the token smart contracts that are hard-coded to scam users.”  Another type is called “soft rug pull,” or an exit scam where the scammer promotes their token to steal from investors by publishing misleading marketing websites and road maps, announcing fake partnerships, or using bots to manufacture trading activity, according to the report.  The study identified a “hard rug pull” as a token scam where the scammer programs their token to steal from investors.  Another type is called “soft rug pull,” or an exit scam where the scammer promotes their token to steal from investors by publishing misleading marketing websites and roadmaps, announcing fake partnerships or using bots to manufacture trading activity, according to the report.  Solidus Labs said 2021’s dizzying rise and fall of the Squid Game token was an example of the combination of two types of rug pulls: The project was a “honeypot” that prevents buyers from reselling their tokens, while having its own “marketing website, white paper and promotional video.”  The hidden theft phenomenon reveals “significant gaps in consumer protection, anti-money laundering and crypto market integrity,” the report added.  The Solidus Labs report is directionally consistent with separate data from Comparitech suggesting that the number of rug pulls climbed to at least 262 this year, more than five times the number in 2021.",NEGATIVE,ETH | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | BNB,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/23/crypto-adds-unsavory-footnote-to-dreadful-2022-year-of-the-rug-pull,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7525026792a6093a63cab9568917afd579898486-5920x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420867,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVvB,1671824293,Crypto Markets Analysis: Prices Trade Quietly Despite Surrounding Noise,"Crypto price movement was relatively mild this week.  Despite the soap opera surrounding Sam Bankman-Fried’s arrest, extradition and incredible shrinking $250 million bond, crypto assets appear to be ignoring the noise and trading on the basis of fundamentals, sentiment and basic supply and demand.  This is welcome news for markets in that focus can now shift to factors that are more connected to valuations. One factor that stands out is the decline in trading volume, understandable given the time of year. Crypto traders can be forgiven for a break after an exhausting and painful year.  The weekly chart for bitcoin (BTC) shows an approximate 50% decline in trading volume on Binance, along with a 17% decline in trading volume for ether.  Bitcoin’s seven-day performance versus the U.S. dollar was middle of the pack (ninth) this week relative to the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  By contrast, BTC finished third in the prior week. Its absolute performance was stronger, however, gaining 1.4% versus a 0.9% decline last week.  Ether’s 4.7% increase was a mirror opposite of last week’s 4.6% decline. ETH landed third on the performance list. BNB led the way with a 6.4% gain.  There was a much narrower dispersion of performance this week, with winners and losers ranging from 6.4% to -3.1%, compared to 30.6% to -15.4% the week prior.  Bitcoin and ether remain range-bound  Our thoughts on bitcoin’s chart are relatively unchanged from our thoughts a week ago.  Momentum is fairly stagnant, with BTC's Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading remaining in fairly neutral territory.  Past trading activity shows significant price agreement between $16,500 and $17,000. When agreement exists to this extent, prices can remain at that level for an extended period of time. This is compounded by the decline in volume that is emblematic of year end trading.  Bitcoin is currently trading fairly tightly to its 20-day moving average, and appears poised to remain there for the time being.  Ether’s chart implies an almost identical situation, which is unsurprising given its persistently tight correlation with bitcoin.  Coindesk Market Index sector performance  CDI Select sector performance shows the Currency (CCYS) and Smart Contract Platform (SCPX) sectors leading the way on both a weekly and monthly basis.  With BTC and ETH composing 62% and 58% of the CoinDesk Currency sector and Smart Contract Platform sector, respectively, the outperformance is strongly tied to the performance of the individual assets.

42417069,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOZh,1671824039,2023: The Year of Regulation vs. Decentralization,"It has been more than a decade since Satoshi introduced the world to the peer-to-peer electronic cash system called Bitcoin, and yet the regulatory landscape for crypto-assets remains a dark forest. After one of the most eventful years in crypto to date, what can we expect from the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (crypto’s primary U.S. market regulators) in 2023?  Securities and Exchange Commission  The SEC nearly doubled the size of its crypto-asset enforcement team in early 2022 and will likely continue to regulate by enforcement in 2023.  Michael Selig is counsel at Willkie Farr & Gallagher. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023.  SEC Chair Gary Gensler believes that the “vast majority” of crypto assets are securities. He said “probably only a few” may not be securities. While he might “think CryptoKitties is not a security,” the SEC is also reportedly investigating non-fungible tokens.  The SEC regards many crypto assets as a type of security called an “investment contract.” In SEC v. W.J. Howey & Co., the U.S. Supreme Court defined an investment contract as a contract, transaction or scheme whereby an investor invests money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.  During his prior tenure as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Gensler oversaw the implementation of new swap market regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. As SEC chair his approach to regulating crypto assets resembles his CFTC approach to regulating swaps. The Gensler-era CFTC disregarded industry opposition and leveraged the existing futures regulatory framework to hurriedly adopt a swaps regulatory framework that did not work for much of the market.  Read more: Adam Miller - 2023: The Year DAOs Follow the Law?  In the case of crypto assets, Gensler has “asked the SEC staff to work directly with entrepreneurs to get their tokens registered and regulated, where appropriate, as securities.” However, it appears unlikely that rules specifically tailored to crypto assets will be proposed during 2023. Gensler’s view is that most crypto assets are securities and therefore most crypto-asset issuers and intermediaries are subject to the same laws and regulations as other securities issuers and intermediaries. Gensler may face pushback from the Republican-controlled House Financial Services Committee in 2023, but is not likely to reverse course.  The regulatory narrative will continue to be shaped by the SEC’s enforcement actions. Since 2017 the SEC has brought dozens of actions for failing to register offers and sales of crypto assets as securities. These actions have mostly involved “utility tokens” sold in the days of initial coin offerings. The legal theory advanced by the defendants in many of these cases has been that the crypto assets were not part of an investment contract because the assets had consumptive use and therefore purchasers should not have reasonably expected profits. But lower courts have thus far rejected this argument, concluding that a crypto asset may be sold as part of an investment contract even if it has consumptive use.  More recently, crypto projects have shifted their focus to decentralization and community ownership. It is common for projects to issue crypto assets as a means of distributing governance and control over a network, protocol or organization to a broad and dispersed community. The legal theory likely to be advanced by these projects under the Howey Test is that such crypto assets are not securities because there is no “other” upon which holders of the crypto asset rely to earn profits.  As certain of the SEC’s more longstanding lawsuits against crypto-asset issuers conclude next year, the SEC may announce novel enforcement actions involving crypto assets associated with more decentralized crypto networks, protocols and organizations. The CFTC brought its first enforcement action against a decentralized autonomous organization this year and it may not be long before the SEC follows suit.  Gensler has emphasized that crypto market intermediaries (“whether they call themselves centralized or decentralized”) must register with the SEC. This signals that the agency may prioritize actions against intermediaries in 2023. These actions could test the theory that a crypto asset initially offered or sold as part of an investment contract remains an investment contract even when it is traded in secondary markets. In this regard, SEC v. Wahi, where the SEC alleges a crypto-asset exchange (Coinbase) employee engaged in insider trading, is a case to watch.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission  The CFTC has limited authority over crypto assets. It has exclusive jurisdiction over commodity derivatives, but only holds anti-manipulation and anti-fraud jurisdiction over commodity spot transactions. Its jurisdiction over crypto assets is based upon its position that bitcoin, ether, tether and other crypto assets are commodities.  CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has requested “clear authority to impose [the CFTC’s] traditional regulatory regime over the digital asset commodity market.” Earlier this year, bipartisan legislators in the U.S. Congress introduced competing bills that would each establish a crypto market intermediary registration regime overseen by the CFTC. These bills are likely to be reintroduced in 2023. After recent crypto market events, a comprehensive crypto bill that expands the CFTC’s jurisdiction may see broad support. However, neither bill would establish a bright line between SEC and CFTC jurisdiction over crypto assets. Gensler believes that most crypto assets are securities and Behnam has not challenged this view. In fact, he has advocated for “shared responsibility” between the agencies. Regardless of what happens on Capitol Hill in 2023, the CFTC is unlikely to win jurisdiction over all crypto assets.  The CFTC has been active in regulating by enforcement. More than 20% of the agency’s enforcement actions in 2022 involved crypto assets, and it is not likely to let up in 2023. Although the agency does not comprehensively regulate crypto-asset spot markets, the CFTC has recently begun to seek crypto-asset trading bans against defendants. This signals that the agency regards itself as the cop on the beat for non-security crypto asset markets. The CFTC’s lawsuit against the Ooki DAO made headlines this year because it raised novel legal questions. One question: Are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) “unincorporated associations” and can they be served with notice of the lawsuit through an online chatbot and forum? This is a case to continue to watch in 2023.  * * *  The crypto-asset regulatory landscape will likely remain a dark forest in 2023. SEC Chair Gensler believes the majority of crypto assets are securities but is not in favor of new crypto market rules or guidance. On the other hand, CFTC Chair Behnam seeks additional CFTC authority over crypto assets but the agency is currently limited in its ability to issue rules or guidance for these markets. While crypto projects continue to push the boundaries of decentralization and community governance, the SEC and CFTC will likely push the boundaries of their existing authorities through novel enforcement actions. With neither agency poised to issue new crypto rules, 2023 will be the year of regulation versus decentralization.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Michael Selig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/23/2023-the-year-of-regulation-vs-decentralization,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54456d9a82cece6a2809c8e136a7c76a1784b8bf-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413325,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8QxK,1671821903,"Over $30B of NFT Trading Volume on Ethereum Is Wash Trading, Research Suggests","It's no secret that wash trading – a form of market manipulation where the buyer and seller in a transaction are the same or collude together – continues to plague the non-fungible token (NFT) market. But a recent report compiled on blockchain data site Dune Analytics has revealed just how bad the problem has become.  According to the analysis compiled by pseudonymous researcher hildobby on Dec. 16, wash trading accounted for over half (58%) of the total NFT trade volumes on Ethereum in 2022. The tactic peaked in January, with wash trading accounting for over 80% of the total NFT trading volume that month.  The researcher used four filters to weed out odd trading behavior that most likely pointed to wash trading. First, they filtered out obvious trades of NFTs between the same wallet address. Second, they looked at back-and-forth trades of the same NFT between two different wallet addresses – one of the most common wash trading tactics. Third, if a wallet address had purchased the same NFT three or more times, it was flagged as a wash trade because of the unlikeliness of the situation. Finally, if a buyer and seller in an NFT transaction had wallets that were first funded by the same wallet, it was obvious that there was a connection between them and was therefore flagged as a wash trade.  To understand how prevalent the practice has become since the NFT markets emerged, when all of the filters were applied over $30 billion of NFT trading volume from all time could be linked to wash trading. This number is staggering, though it only represents about 1.5% of all trades that have taken place on Ethereum. If that seems confusing, don't worry: What it shows is that the majority of trades are legitimate, but happen at a generally lower price than the wash trades, which makes sense when the point of many wash trades is to artificially inflate the price of an NFT collection.  ""Almost halfof the amazing 'total trade volume' figures we often hear is just people gaming the system, and not legitimate trading,"" hildobby wrote.  According to the data, NFT marketplaces LooksRare and X2Y2 – which both offer forms of token rewards for engagement on the platform – had the highest percentages of wash trading, 98% and 87% of their total volume, respectively.  Hildobby attributed the rise in wash trading activity to increased competition among NFT marketplaces to capture trade volume market share.  ""Well-intentioned schemes to incentivize usage quickly emerged as a way to pull ahead in the race to attract this volume and become the most successful marketplace,"" the author wrote. ""Many widely quoted statistics have therefore been misleading at best, painting a picture of organic usage which hasn’t perfectly matched reality.""  Wash trading is illegal under U.S. law and remains difficult to track in the crypto space. In February, blockchain research firm Chainalysis reported that while most NFT wash traders were previously not profitable due to high gas fees, a group of 110 profitable wash traders were still able to make $8.4 million in profit.

According to the case filed Thursday, Senior Vice President Chris Ko, Chief Operating Officer and head of games Matt Nutt and co-founder Rudy Koch, stole Mythical’s plans for raising capital, funneling $150 million into their new firm Fenix Games while still employed by the company.  Last year, Ko, Nutt and Koch were tasked with acquiring investors for Mythical’s venture capital wing, Mythical Ventures. After each separately announced their departure from the firm in November, the executives announced that Fenix Games raised funds from Cypher Capital, a lead investor the executives had previously been working with to obtain capital for Mythical Ventures.  “We believe very strongly in the protection of our intellectual property and corporate assets,” Nate Nesbitt, head of communications at Mythical told CoinDesk. “In this instance, it was necessary to take these steps to rectify this situation and protect the company’s corporate interest, as is our duty to our employees and investors.”  The firm is suing Ko, Nutt and Koch on 10 counts including fraud and breach of contract.

The rapid uptick in the price of the token showed the positivity, albeit brief, that had spread across investors in the token. However, as the dust settles on the disgraced founder, the question now becomes whether the digital asset can hold the gains from yesterday. FTT Jumps 65% On Thursday, Bankman-Fried’s parents had put their home up to raise money for the $250 million bond put on the former CEO, with friends and associates speculated to have helped come up with the 10% collateral required for his release. However this was achieved, Sam was released under house arrest. Related Reading: Exchange Inflows, Outflows At A Stalemate As Bitcoin Refuses To Budge Soon after the news broke, the price of FTX’s native token FTT made a significant jump. After trending just below $1 for the better part of the week, the 65% push had brought it above $1.1. This brought renewed vigor to the market and momentum rightfully picked up. FTT price spikes following SBF making bail | Source: FTTUSD on TradingView.com The problem now is that FTT has not done a good job of holding onto these gains. Naturally, the brief surge in price had triggered sell-offs among investors looking to take out some profit, triggering another fall below $1. In the early hours of Friday, there had been a 9% jump that brought FTT’s price above $1 once more, but even this would not hold. Support remains weak at $1 and it is now a battle between the bears and the bulls to turn this critical level in their favor. Right now, the bears remain in control of the digital asset with the price sitting at $0.96, and FTT has struggled to break the resistance mounting at $1. What About FTX? For many in the space who lost money when the FTX crypto exchange collapsed, this is just the beginning of the battle. Charges have already been brought against Bankman-Fried and his associates in what is being called the ‘largest fraud of the generation’ but there is still a long way to go. On Thursday, it was reported that Paul Hastings LLP had been appointed by a committee to represent the interests of creditors in the FTX bankruptcy case. So far, the new FTX CEO John J. Ray III said he and his team had been able to recover around $1 billion worth of assets. Related Reading: Ethereum Classic Hashrate Dumps Almost 50% In 3 Months, What About ETC?

42411283,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMfkl,1671813251,Bankman-Fried's Incredible Shrinking ‘$250 Million Bond’,"Sam Bankman-Fried walked out of federal court on Thursday essentially a free man.  News outlets all around the globe reported that Bankman-Fried got out of jail by posting a gargantuan, unprecedented “$250 million bond.” In court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos described it as the “largest ever” pretrial bond.  But, as it turns out, there is less than meets the eye in this “$250 million bond.” In fact, a lot less.  James A. Murphy was the founder and chairman of law firm Murphy & McGonigle.  In the typical federal case, a bail bondsman would charge between 10%-15% of the amount in cash to issue a surety bond or “bail bond.” In the case of Bankman-Fried’s astronomical bond, 15% of $250 million would be $37.5 million. But Bankman-Fried did not pay $37.5 million for his bond. No, Bankman-Fried actually paid no cash at all for his “$250 million bond.” Nothing. Zero.  There is a second way to acquire a bail bond. A defendant, or someone on their behalf, may pledge collateral in the full amount of the bond. Then, if the defendant fails to appear in court, the pledged collateral is forfeit to the court. So, in Bankman-Fried’s case, that would mean he would need a benefactor to step up and pledge property worth $250 million to get the bond. But that did not happen either.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Released on $250M Bail Secured by Parents  Instead, Bankman-Fried’s parents promised to pledge as collateral their Palo Alto, California, home, where he'll also be staying under house arrest. The Palo Alto home is rumored to be worth $4 million. And that is the full extent of the collateral pledged to guarantee the $250 million bond. No other collateral was posted or promised.  So where did that $250 million figure come from? Great question.  In this case, Bankman-Fried was not required to post a conventional bail bond. Instead, Bankman-Fried was simply released from custody on something called a personal recognizance bond. The personal recognizance bond contains Bankman-Fried’s solemn promise (and his parents’ promise) to pay the court $250 million if he fails to show up for trial at the appointed time.  Yes, you read that right. Bankman-Fried walked out of court essentially a free man by signing a piece of paper where he promised to pay the court $250 million if he decides to flee to another country with no extradition. This, of course, is totally absurd.  See also: Bankman-Fried Is a 'Master of Deflection,' Securities Lawyer Says  The attempt by the prosecutor’s office to sell this as some extraordinarily onerous bail condition would be laughable. Except the millions of customers who Bankman-Fried defrauded aren’t laughing.  Who could have imagined that the Bahamas would have stricter bail laws for financial fraud than the United States?

42411284,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMfo4,1671810950,The End of Crypto Twitter as We Know It?,"If Elon Musk’s controversial leadership of Twitter sends the platform into the slow death spiral many are predicting, what happens to Crypto Twitter?  Insider Intelligence this week predicted Twitter will lose 30 million users over the next two years. That’s about 10% of the active user base, but given that many of those expected to remain are likely to be relatively inactive or are bots, the impact on real, human engagement could be significant. It could also breed a kind of reverse network effect, as the smaller community makes the site less attractive, leading to more departures in a negative feedback loop.  It is also reasonable to assume that Crypto Twitter, the argumentative “CT” community of crypto enthusiasts, critics, meme propagators, NFT creators, coin-pumpers and related trolls, will also see exits.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  More to the point: What will the community look like, in terms of its diversity of ideas, after those departures? Given the prominent (if highly imperfect) role that Twitter has played as a forum in which industry stakeholders discuss issues and hash out differences, it’s an extremely relevant matter for the future of crypto.  Generally speaking, the kinds of people considering leaving Twitter – some folks are calling for a mass “Twixit” event – are probably different in their political and ideological persuasions from those adamant on staying.  Twixit “leavers” likely skew toward a more liberal political bent. Many have expressed discomfort with a reported increase in anti-semitic and racist slurs as Musk has adjusted the moderation policies. Others are angered by the recent suspension of journalists’ accounts. Already half of Twitter’s advertisers reportedly abandoned the platform in the month after Musk took over out of concern about negative associations with their brand. Other corporate accounts are worried that the new CEO’s mass layoffs are leaving the site vulnerable to security breaches.  Those “remainers” enthusiastic about the new Twitter and so committed to stay are likely to be more supportive of Musk’s stated mission as “a free speech absolutist” to end “shadowbanning” and remove supposed political bias from content moderation. Many describe themselves as “anti-woke,” expressing concern about culturally imposed constraints on speech that liberals consider offensive. They tend to align with Silicon Valley tech leaders in their ongoing battle with the mainstream press and believe that “citizen journalism” on Twitter provides a more reliable source of information than “biased” news organizations. Their ranks include a large number of libertarian-leaning people who staunchly defend property rights and are suspicious of government intervention and surveillance.  That kind of division seems destined to play out in Crypto Twitter because the population of people interested in this technology draws from a similar spectrum of personalities as the general population. (Contrary to mainstream critics’ depictions of a monolithic community of lawless, money-worshiping “crypto bros,” the humans in this field encompass a diverse array of backgrounds and political leanings.)  Groupthink in Crypto Twitter’s future  This matters because of the outsized role Twitter has played in crypto discourse. As a decentralized community with no central decision-makers, there needs to be public fora for stakeholders in the industry to hash out ideas and differences. For detailed changes to code, that debate often happens in developer chat rooms, but when it comes to arguments over big, contentious issues, Twitter has played a vital role.  Twitter’s place in crypto was cemented during the Block Size War of 2016-2017, climaxing with the implementation of a “user-activated soft fork” in the Bitcoin code, which effectively prevented miners from implementing a proposal from certain businesses to increase the block capacity of the blockchain. On Twitter, supporters of the “small blocks” status quo aggressively propagated the hashtag “#UASF” to successfully stir support for it.  If that was the high point, many, myself included, argue that the crypto experience on Twitter has deteriorated significantly since then.  The clearest mark of that is the surge in token-shilling bots that fill up replies to tweets and effectively discourage engagement. Musk’s pre-acquisition criticisms of Twitter’s handling of bot accounts and the notion that his move to charge users for identifying check marks could discourage their proliferation offered some initial hope for potential change. But the token bots have kept coming. Meanwhile, at least from this observer’s perch, two other negative experiences of Crypto Twitter appear to have intensified: the toxicity of interactions and the discouragement of nuance and careful readings.  Creating a more homogenous, increasingly fortified pool of ideologues, whether of the left or the right, could make things even more unbearable for anyone expressing a view that challenges that majority. There’s a piling-on effect that happens when one side is disproportionately represented, as encouragement from like-minded users sparks a dopamine release feedback loop to drive abusive behavior. Eventually, when the dissenting minority is driven away, perhaps the toxicity will die down. But then what are you left with? Groupthink.  None of this is in crypto’s interest. It’s axiomatic that permissionless, open-source environments thrive on a plurality of ideas from which the “wisdom of the crowd” can be drawn. Indeed, diversity of thought – which, interestingly, is an argument against “wokeness” – is the reason for the one relatively consistent mindset among crypto people of otherwise varying political persuasions: a resistance to centralized authority over the design of this technology.  Non-Twitter alternatives  Now, I’m not especially worried that if Crypto Twitter shrinks to the point where it ceases to be a useful, open, multi-viewpoint forum, the crypto community will lose its capacity to properly debate and develop ideas. The era of Web3 may shift us out of centralized social media altogether and into wallet-based, on-chain networks of conversation that, while siloed for specific projects, create links of interoperable exchange across communities in which ideas can intersect, clash and synthesize into new concepts.  As my colleague Daniel Kuhn opined, Musk is indirectly offering a clear argument for a decentralized Web3 internet. The contradictions and flip-flops seen in his erratic attempts to define and manage free speech on Twitter are not necessarily a problem unique to him; they are the direct outcome of centralized control, no matter who is in charge. Free speech cannot be “guaranteed” by a controlling private individual with his own natural, human whims and self interests.  The real good news is that we’re already seeing the failings of Musk’s attempts to fix Twitter spurring interest in a new, crypto-friendly alternative: for instance, Nostr, the open-relay protocol that’s seeking to build a censorship-resistant social network, now with former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s financial support. Meanwhile, Mastodon is gaining support.  It was fun while it lasted. But Crypto Twitter’s demise mightn’t be a bad thing.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Michael J.

42413328,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8R08,1671810246,"Craig Wright Can Appeal Satoshi Defamation Finding, Norwegian Court Rules","Craig Wright has been given permission to appeal a Norwegian court ruling concerning his claim to be Satoshi Nakomoto, founder of Bitcoin, CoinDesk has been told.  In October, Judge Helen Engebrigtsen of the Oslo District Court ruled that Magnus Granath (who goes by the Twitter handle Hodlonaut) had been entitled to post tweets in 2019 calling Wright a “fraud” and a “scammer” for saying he was the true founder of Bitcoin.  Wright’s right to protest that ruling has now been upheld by the Norwegian Court of Appeal, lawyers involved in the case have told CoinDesk, offering yet another twist in an already tangled series of legal cases.  “For Dr. Wright, this decision means that the Court of Appeals will hear his case and render its own independent decision,” Wright’s attorney, Halvor Manshaus, told CoinDesk in a statement.  “The case involves other non-economic interest, aside from just the monetary claims, and may also raise important legal principles for the court to address,” Manshaus, a partner at Oslo practice Schjødt, added. The lawyer cited such issues as “defamation, protection of the personal sphere and harassment.”  Granath’s lawyers, meanwhile, attempted to play down the significance of the decision in a jurisdiction where there is a presumption that any case can be heard twice.  “There is nothing dramatic or unusual about the decision” by the appeals court, said Ørjan Salvesen Haukaas, a partner at DLA Piper, in an email.  Manshaus told CoinDesk back in October of Wright’s intention to appeal, saying that “anonymous online bullying” could have a “chilling effect” on public discourse. Granath (Hodlonaut) hoped to use the Norwegian case to forestall an unfavorable ruling in the U.K., where defamation laws are stricter.  In the U.K., Wright scored a partial legal victory on Wednesday when he was awarded 900,000 pounds (US$1.1 million) in costs in relation to a separate claim made by podcaster Peter McCormack. Wright was previously awarded only nominal damages by U.K. Judge Martin Chamberlain, who said Wright had “put forward deliberately false evidence.”  In her judgment, Engebrigtsen said Granath had “sufficient factual grounds” for his tweets, after witnesses at the trial demonstrated discrepancies in the documents Wright used to prove his claims, such as typefaces that weren’t around in 2008.  In tweets sent on Wednesday, Wright appeared to signal he was giving up on legal attempts to prove he invented Bitcoin.

6237251,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513556,1671810047,MATIC Price Enters Recovery Mode But Can It Touch $0.90?,"The MATIC price has remained bearish for most of this month. Presently, MATIC is attempting to correct its price. Over the last 24 hours, the coin is up by 2%. In the past week, however, the coin has depreciated by over 8%. Although, securing daily gains has helped the altcoin reverse some of its weekly losses. With Bitcoin consolidating at the moment, many altcoins are unable to break past their immediate resistance. The technical outlook for MATIC was bearish, but certain indicators pointed towards a potential rally in the upcoming trading sessions. The buying strength remained low, which means that accumulation was also lower on the chart. For prices to propel above the immediate price ceiling, buyers have to surpass sellers. As the altcoin logged gains over the last 48 hours, MATIC now has a strong support region extending from $0.70 to $0.63. As MATIC traded laterally between different price zones for weeks of this month, investors have remained worried. This caused sellers to short the asset, resulting in increased selling pressure. The altcoin currently presents an entry opportunity as the bulls are slowly making a comeback in the market. The amount of altcoin traded in the last session fell, which still points to a bearish presence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Will Spike By End 2022, Which Way Will It Push BTC? MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart The altcoin was exchanging hands at $0.80 at the time of writing. After a period of consolidation, it has finally started to register gains. The coin’s overhead price ceiling was $0.82; if that was breached, MATIC could attempt to return to or even exceed the $0.90 mark. The $0.82 level has previously acted as a platform for a rally in the altcoin’s case. On the flip side, if unable to rest above the $0.77 mark, the price will first fall to $0.70 and then to $0.67. The amount of MATIC traded in the last session was in red, indicating that sellers were still active on the daily chart. Technical Analysis Buying strength has remained low due to increased shorting over the past few weeks. The Relative Strength (RSI) Index stood at 40, which indicated that even though buyers were making a comeback, sellers remained strong. However, there has been an uptick in the RSI over the last few days. MATIC’s price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which demonstrates that sellers were driving the price momentum. On the other hand, MATIC’s price was attempting to move above the 200-SMA line (green below) which paints an extremely bullish picture. This meant that the altcoin could soon move above the $0.82 resistance mark and rally up. In accordance with the entry point for buyers, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) painted fading red signal bars. These declining red signal bars are tied to the decline in the sell signal for the altcoin, which also means shorting currently might not be a good idea. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Key Trend is Forming and Swift Recovery Could Occur The MACD depicts the change in price momentum, and these bars portray that the indicator could reflect bullish signals over the next trading sessions.

Is it possible 2023 is the year energy FUD around Bitcoin finally dies?  Kent Halliburton is the president and chief operating officer of Sazmining. This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023.  Green bitcoiners enter  So-called “green bitcoiners” made themselves heard over the past 12 months, and they’ve brought novel ideas to the fore. Troy Cross, professor of philosophy at Reed College in Oregon and fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, has broached several ideas on bitcoin (BTC) mining and energy with which bitcoiners are still wrestling.  Together with Yale-NUS professor of philosophy Andrew Bailey, Cross has been arguing that bitcoiners have a sort of moral duty to uphold related to bitcoin and the environment. They say their ideas is a “way to invest in bitcoin without contributing, even slightly, to unsustainable bitcoin mining.” (Their white paper came out in late 2021, but gained traction in 2022.)  Meanwhile, Cleantech investor Daniel Batten put together groundbreaking research into bitcoin mining, and may have found a way to put a significant dent in humanity's methane problem. Batten has explained through careful calculations how and why bitcoin mining is the only available technology that can mitigate humanity’s methane emissions at scale.  Finally, in 2022 Jason Maier crowdfunded and wrote his book, “A Progressive’s Case for Bitcoin.” He makes the case that Bitcoin is, contrary to critics, a net positive for the environment.  Dawn of green companies  In 2022, several bitcoin-focused companies launched with a mandate of proving the viability that the Bitcoin blockchain could contribute to fighting climate change through competition and free markets. Synota, for instance, was founded this year and raised a $3 million seed round to pursue its mission.  The company’s platform allows energy companies and their customers to trade energy and money more frequently and with less friction than traditional payment rails allow. It’s a use that may “promote global energy abundance by integrating Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and energy,” they write.  Read more: The More Energy Bitcoin Uses, the Better  Did you hear of the company that converts landfill waste into BTC? Vespene launched this year, and uses methane emissions from landfill as fuel to power bitcoin miners, putting into practice what Batten theorized. In August, it closed a $4.3 million funding round to continue its pioneering project into carbon-negative mining.  Finally, Jack Dorsey’s digital payments company, Block, and Alyse Killeen’s VC firm, Stillmark, recently invested in a company that builds out renewable bitcoin mining sites in parts of Africa that have excess power. Still at the seed stage, Gridless, in 2023, plans to launch a hydro mining site in Malawi and a solar-powered mining site in West Africa.  Admittedly, critics of the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption and environmental impact have made a meaningful dent on adoption. For some, the network has become synonymous with wasted electricity and electronics waste. But the situation is changing fast.  Read more: ECB Official Says Energy-Intensive Crypto Should Be Banned  Just as when China's President Xi banned crypto he only helped prove how unstoppable the Bitcoin network is, Bitcoin’s environmental critics are fostering a green revolution that will show how adaptable and sustainable Bitcoin can be. The meteoric rise of fresh research, voices and visions of what Bitcoin could be demonstrate this.  Bitcoin can and will be a net positive for energy and the environment.

42417068,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOYf,1671806075,DeFi Derivatives Trading Has Untapped Potential,"As cults of personality and centralized platforms lose their sheen, we must return to the fundamentals that drove the crypto industry at its inception: decentralization, self-custody and economic empowerment for all. In a phrase: decentralized finance (DeFi).  DeFi brings a lot of diversity to our economy, but one specific sector of DeFi that will continue to see prolonged, exponential growth in 2023 is the derivatives market, and even more specifically options trading. The reasons for crypto options' high probability of growth in the new year can be pinned to massive yet-unrealized potential for trading in both retail and institutional capacities. If we learn to read the markets, make smart use of the data at our disposal and overcome a few speed bumps along the way, options will certainly drive the next era of DeFi to higher highs than ever before.  Greg Magadini is director of derivatives at Amberdata. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  Everybody wants options  According to DeFi Llama, just the top 10 DeFi options marketplaces alone have a combined total value locked (TVL) of over $180 million. This shows how popular options are. And for good reason – options are, essentially, insurance policies that allow the ability for investors to tailor trades and risk tolerance, which is why they’ve remained a popular investment strategy during the bear market.  Options give traders, well, options. Think about insuring your home – certainly every homeowner will carry fire insurance to help protect their investment. This behavior is what allows you to tailor or insure the risks that you don't want to take, and basically trade that risk away to someone else. With options you're able to express investment views that incorporate new elements; instead of just saying “price go up” or ”price go down,” you can say “price go up by this date,” or “in this timeframe” or “with this velocity.”  And while the crypto options market continues to grow extremely fast, there is still plenty of room for growth. If we consider the market cap of bitcoin versus the outstanding notional open interest of crypto options, it's about 6%. Whereas in traditional finance, that number is 200%. Let’s call it an opportunity to see a 30 to 35 times increase just to match the same sort of relative levels as traditional finance.  So, what’s holding the options market back from achieving this growth in the here and now?  Read more: The Year Crypto Yields Blew Up | Opinion  Crypto is still trying to figure out what’s important  On the surface, there are a lot of similarities between crypto options and traditional finance (TradFi) options. But the main difference is that we’re still learning how external events affect the crypto market, while in TradFi people know how to identify big mover events. TradFi investors have access to earning reports or substantial company news covered by the media. These events inform traders what the smartest trades will be, as long as they pay close attention. But crypto is the exact opposite.  In crypto, we don't necessarily know what it looks like when an encryption algorithm breaks. When someone tweeted that Vitalik Buterin had died, ether (ETH) temporarily “crashed” on the “news” before swinging right back. With such fast-moving tech, there are numerous events and forks that are necessary and common, and yet people don't know how they will affect the market. Even the Ethereum Merge in September – a hugely anticipated event that had people expecting extreme volatility – came and went and the prices remained remarkably stable.  See also: 2023: The Year Blockchain Becomes a Sustainability Solution | Opinion  The lesson? We don't know how to value the true potential of crypto yet, and we know even less about how it should move based on volatility events. But all is not lost. Not only do trading strategies like options provide us with ways to mitigate losses and customize risk levels, but the way our underlying blockchains are designed provides us with access to an enormous amount of consistently-generated, granular data such as spot data, which provides a true source of price and volatility. Analyzing this data will teach us to recognize trends and movement events. And the best part is the more use DeFi gets, the more data we have at our disposal and the more we learn. DeFi only gets stronger as it grows.  DeFi options will continue to see exponential growth due to their dynamic nature, massive investment prospects and, soon, ease of access and use. There are currently many competing models, and certainly many questions still loom large, especially with regard to regulation. Yet, as things mature we can expect to see the barriers fall. More investors will see DeFi for the next evolution in our economy that it truly is. Options trading will help drive this adoption, because as an investment strategy it offers immense utility to institutions and retail traders alike.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Greg Magadini,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/23/defi-derivatives-trading-has-untapped-potential,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8488710e2c538bf22158c3371f43e8c654d4a8e-2048x1362.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

6233884,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513532,1671805853,Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Is Up 5% On This News,"After a tough week for Dogecoin (DOGE) investors, there was at least a small Christmas present from the European crypto exchange Bitstamp yesterday. The fifth-largest exchange by spot trading volume, according to recent data from CoinMarketCap, announced that it will list Dogecoin. Bitstamp, which is based in Luxembourg, allows trading between fiat currencies and Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies. As of yesterday, Dogecoin (DOGE) can now be exchanged for euros and USD. “We’ve launched Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency inspired by the popular Shiba Inu meme, for our customers. Buy and trade DOGE on Bitstamp today!” the exchange wrote. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Poised To Rally Big-Time On Today’s PCE Release Dogecoin Price Shows Slight Recovery Driven by the news, DOGE recorded a slight upward move today, causing the Dogecoin price to rise by 5% temporarily. At press time, DOGE was trading at $0.776. Thus, DOGE had already lost some of its profits again and is only 2% above the previous day’s price as of press time. The news has also caused Dogecoin to see a brisk increase in 24-hour trading volume. Compared to the previous period, DOGE’s trading volume spiked by 76%, totaling $590 million. Still, the DOGE army has failed to push the price above the key resistance at $0.0791. A look at the 4-hour chart reveals that the price is still in strong bearish territory. If DOGE fails to break through the aforementioned resistance, a retest of the support at $0.0700 seems likely to happen. A look at the 1-day chart also reveals that Dogecoin has been in a descending trend channel since the beginning of the month. After trading as high as $0.114 on December 5, DOGE is currently trapped in this descending trend. A close significantly above the $0.0776 level would mark a breakout from the trend channel and could bring new hope. As NewsBTC reported, DOGE investors can hope for a positive boost from today’s release of the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE). If the data comes in significantly below expectations, what seems very like to some analysts, the US dollar could weaken and boost risk assets such as DOGE.

After the Twitter acquisition, Musk was still very active in promoting DOGE. The Tesla CEO hinted several times that Dogecoin could play a role in Twitter’s future path. However, in the past week, there were two harsh dampers for the DOGE army. On the one hand, a vote ended with Musk stepping down as Twitter CEO in the coming weeks, and on the other, the platform introduced a new chart feature for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but not for the meme coin.

42417079,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOiz,1671805399,ZK Rollups Bring Ethereum's Decentralized Vision Into Focus,"In 2015, the Ethereum protocol proposed a vision for a decentralized world computer capable of rearchitecting a free and open internet – removed from the whims and constraints of centralized entities. While Ethereum has become the foundation for Web3 as we know it, its growth was underscored by the upgrades that would be required to realize its full potential. As a result, layer 2 has emerged as clear frontrunners in the race to scale the network for mass adoption. Systems using zero-knowledge (ZK) technologies are among the most promising – and their potential isn’t limited to scaling.  Mihailo Bjelic is the co-founder of Polygon. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  ZK-powered technology is expected to revolutionize myriad sectors from gaming to payments, and from digital identity to enterprise solutions. Looking ahead, 2023 promises to be the year ZK tech truly starts to take off.  What is zero-knowledge technology?  Zero-knowledge technology refers to tools that use cryptography to prove that something is true without revealing any additional information other than the fact that it is true. The value of such a tool for crypto is that it greatly reduces the costs of processing data (such as transaction data on a blockchain) without compromising the security or decentralization that make these monetary networks unique.  The application of ZK tech allows blockchain networks to prove the authenticity of their operations in the most efficient way, using the fewest possible steps. This has the power to be transformational for Web3 development by reducing costs, increasing throughput capacity, and expanding potential use cases far beyond what is currently possible.  Read more: Polygon Stakes Claim to Fastest Zero-Knowledge Layer 2 With ‘Plonky2’ Launch  There is little doubt among blockchain developers that ZK technology represents the ultimate solution to blockchain scaling. For many, it’s the most crucial development in ensuring a fair internet environment for the free exchange of value and digital ownership of assets and data, all without being subjugated to centralized control.  Until recently, ZK-based scaling was limited by its incompatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It’s not strictly incompatible, of course, but perhaps unfriendly. In fact, many industry participants projected that it would take more than a decade to build a performant, EVM-compatible ZK rollup. Fortunately, it took considerably less time than that.  While the Ethereum Merge in 2022 was instrumental in transitioning the network from proof-of-work (PoW) to the more efficient proof-of-stake (PoS), it represents just the first step in the broader Ethereum road map, with improvements to how on-chain data is stored likely to be the next step.  The realization of this road map may take years, though it’s clear that ZK technology is a part of Ethereum’s long-term vision. Indeed, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has stated outright that ZK rollups are the solution to scaling Ethereum. Given this, it's critical that the development and application of ZK tech adhere to the core ideals of Web3, with transparency chief among them.  Users cannot truly trust the outputs of a ZK-powered tool if they cannot independently verify its inputs. In this way, transparency requires proving systems that have source-available code for every component.  How will ZK tech benefit crypto?  As mentioned, ZK has a wide range of applications but there are several where there is value in the near term.  With ZK’s ability to increase throughput and security and reduce fees, ZK rollups will also be a meaningful tool for the decentralized finance sector. Leveraging Ethereum's robust security and decentralization while providing scale in a trustless way could take DeFi to the next level.  Similarly, zero knowledge tech could have a knock-on effect on the payments industry. Crypto has failed to become a widely accepted channel for business and consumer payments, largely a consequence of limited scalability and high fees (and taxes, but that’s a separate issue with a less-technical solution). Breakthroughs such as zkEVM look to challenge this, allowing robust payment stacks to be realized on Ethereum.  Additionally, for blockchain gaming applications to match the volume of users seen in the mainstream gaming sector, ZK rollups will be essential for processing the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of micro-transactions that a typical blockchain game would require.  Another area rife for the kinds of innovation that zkEVM can bring is enterprise blockchain solutions. Until now, enterprise users have been wary of the security issues presented by decentralized networks and their perceived lack of oversight and accountability.  Read more: The Trend Towards Blockchain Privacy: Zero-Knowledge Proofs  Zero-knowledge technology is the very thing that will deliver accountability to decentralized networks without submitting to arbitrary oversight. Its implementation will provide the kind of security that enterprises need to interact with decentralized blockchains.  ZK tech is also being applied to digital identity, providing a decentralized, privacy-first means for users to verify their credentials and identity without ever revealing personal information. Such an ID offers a decentralized solution for users to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks without relying on third parties to store and process their data.  In response to the collapse of the FTX exchange, Vitalik proposed a ZK-based solution for preventing future FTXs. A cryptocurrency exchange could use Zero-Knowledge proofs to demonstrate solvency by publishing a proof of reserves. This would allow an exchange to confirm it has the liquidity to cover customer withdrawals without revealing the sensitive business information contained therein.  With so much potential coming from a single technological breakthrough, it's increasingly difficult to argue that ZK rollups won't play a central role in the broad adoption of cryptocurrency. While this list of possible use cases is by no means comprehensive, what is more likely is that the most useful, groundbreaking application of ZK doesn’t yet exist.  As a helpful analog, consider that the explosion of social media was in part the consequence of its being an application that could only exist on the internet – it had no real world antecedent. Somewhere there is a young dev with a nascent idea for something that can only be built on a blockchain.

Image: Altcoin Buzz WAVES Down By 99% Off Its April 2022 ATH Blockchain founder Sasha Ivanov has urged different crypto exchanges on Wednesday to cut off the futures markets that are connected to the crypto as she insists that it’s doing more harm than good. The crypto exchanges included Kraken, Bybit, Binance, and OKX. Ivanov on a Twitter post said: “They are a breeding ground for FUD and making money off short positions, profitable because of it. I kindly ask all centralized exchanges to disable Waves future markets.” Evidently, the blockchain native currency has nosedived by more than 45% as seen in the past couple of weeks. In fact, its numbers now are completely off-track as it’s down by as much as 99% from its ATH as seen in April 2022. Stablecoin Acting Erratic Lately USDN has been extremely volatile. The token’s most recent de-peg came following South Korea’s digital asset exchange association issuing a warning. Related Reading: MATIC Seen Breaking Present Support With Sustained Momentum Crypto total market cap at nearly $774 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com According to Wu Blockchain, the Korean Federation of Exchanges (KFE) has issued an “investment warning” for WAVES. The reason for this is because of the erratic price movements of the USDN stablecoin, which is intended to keep its $1 peg at all times. WAVES was flagged as an “investment warning” by the Korea Federation of Exchanges. The reason is that the USDN stablecoin has been fluctuating rapidly. Upbit will decide whether to terminate the transaction within two weeks. https://t.co/wiB5gSfm7f — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 8, 2022",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ICO | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/news/waves-dragged-down-by-usdn/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/6232520.jpeg

The International Chess Federation (FIDE), the sport’s governing body, announced Friday it is partnering with the Avalanche blockchain to bring its competitions into Web3.  The partnership will create “operational efficiencies for players and federations and improve game integrity,” according to a press release, such as publishing tournament data and player rankings on-chain, as well as AVAX-hosted tournament prize pools.  The tie-up also places Ava Labs, the builders behind the Avalanche blockchain, and Core, a self-custody crypto wallet, as featured sponsors at physical chess tournaments around the world, including the World Chess Championship and Chess Olympiad.  “Chess is a unique sport and this cooperation will allow us to unify our community and strengthen the ties between players, clubs, federations and FIDE,” Emil Sutovsky, FIDE CEO, said in a statement.  FIDE’s Web3 integrations follow alongside the chess world’s gradual embrace of digital mediums. The federation says more than 100 million people play online chess regularly and compete in over 25 million virtual chess matches each day.  Despite mainstream excitement for Web3 and non-fungible tokens (NFT) declining in recent months, federations like FIDE still see potential in the industry to grow its sport. The governing body of table tennis launched a similar Web3 campaign last August.

42413326,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8QyG,1671803069,"Crypto Funding Plunged in 2022, but VC Head Sees Areas of Opportunity for 2023","Venture capital investments in blockchain startups soared to a record $25.2 billion in 2021, driven by bullish optimism and financing surges for non-fungible tokens (NFT) and decentralized finance projects. In 2022, funding slowed dramatically and is projected to be about one-third of 2021’s record, following a wave of fallen companies including hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, lender Celsius Network and exchange giant FTX.  David Pakman, managing partner and venture investing head at crypto-focused venture capital firm CoinFund, discussed in an interview with CoinDesk what the investment landscape will look like in 2023 and what crypto verticals could emerge stronger in the post-FTX world.  ""Crypto has seen a lot of self-harm in 2022 and it feeds the narrative that we’re already fighting against: ‘Oh, scammy people doing scammy things.’ And here’s yet another example,” said Pakman, noting that the downfall of FTX was due to human behavior, not technological failure. “Hopefully, we’re weeding them out of the system.""  2023 investment landscape  CoinFund was an early investor in FTX and had a small amount of equity, which has now been written to zero, said Pakman. The firm didn’t hold any FTT tokens but had what he believed was a “very small trade” in progress when the exchange collapsed. The FTX investment predated Pakman, who joined CoinFund last year after spending 13 years at tech and healthcare-focused venture capital firm Venrock.  CoinFund announced a $300 million Web3-focused fund in August, and regulatory filings last month revealed plans to raise $250 million for a seed investments fund, indicating the firm has continued to raise money despite the macro environment.  “We were nervous even at the beginning of this year, and getting more nervous as the year went on given the macro environment and the stuff happening in crypto.” Pakman said of CoinFund’s own fundraising efforts. “But we’re very fortunate that we have [limited partners] that actually prefer to see us investing in this pricing environment.”  Bear markets can benefit venture capital firms because shakier markets lead to lower valuations and more attractive entry points for potential investors  2023 predictions  Pakman thinks crypto investments will continue focusing on areas that were in progress before all of the turbulence, including layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains, NFTs, gaming and the Web3 development stack that’s maturing enough to entice Web2 developers to make the jump. The collapse of a centralized exchange has also put more focus on decentralized finance (DeFi).  ""The FTX and Celsius stuff – and all the other failures – might be creating renewed interest in productizing DeFi in a way that’s easier to access by both institutions and individuals. Because DeFi is not super easy to access,” said Pakman.  Post-FTX path forward  “How do we get out of this loop of bad events happen – largely because of a human-led CeFi mistake – that exposes all sorts of other risky behaviors that lead to this domino effect of more companies failing?” asked Pakman, referring to centralized finance. “We don’t want lots of companies failing.”  Companies should focus on risk management and the conservative use of leverage, he said, though startups should try to avoid using leverage at all.  “Creating a startup is one of the riskiest things you can do. It almost never works,” noted Pakman.  “When you have some success, you don’t want to then bring in a bunch of extra risk by using leverage or doing other stupid things because it’s hard enough to get to a success scenario,” Pakman said. “Retire risk as you move on, don’t create more.”  Read more: 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023",NEUTRAL,FTT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | FTT,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/23/crypto-funding-plunged-in-2022-but-vc-head-sees-areas-of-opportunity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea8ddfa7c4966786e949b0e524ce30fb0e91b638-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413337,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8R8Y,1671802840,First Mover Americas: SEC Scrutnizes Crypto Audits; SBF Gets Bail,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Top Stories  Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been released on bail after appearing in U.S. federal court in New York on Thursday. Bankman-Fried was told he can live with his parents on $250 million bail secured in part by their Palo Alto, California, house. His release also includes a long list of requirements for him to remain free while he faces charges. He's not allowed to make financial transactions of more than $1,000, can't open new lines of credit, can't leave the house except to exercise and must go through substance abuse and mental health treatment, according to the agreement.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is increasing its scrutiny of audits of cryptocurrency companies in an effort to warn investors who may feel assured by audits such as proof-of-reserve reports. “Investors should not place too much confidence in the mere fact a company says it’s got a proof-of-reserves from an audit firm,” said Paul Munter, the SEC’s acting chief accountant. Having such a report “is not enough information for an investor to assess whether the company has sufficient assets to cover its liabilities,” he added.  Tron founder Justin Sun was a top client of crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments. A private financial document reviewed by CoinDesk shows that Sun, one of the richest figures in crypto, was responsible for the vast majority of a key Valkyrie division’s assets under management. He had more than $580 million of bitcoin stashed with the asset manager at one point in August. This amounted to over 90% of money at Valkyrie’s largest division, Valkyrie Digital Assets LLC.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows year-to-date performance of bitcoin and crypto stocks.  While bitcoin has tanked 63% this year, crypto stocks, often seen as a proxy for digital assets, have suffered bigger losses.  It shows that buying bitcoin is the best bet if you want to add crypto exposure to your portfolio.

""The runway is getting shorter"" to start following rules and register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, its chair, Gary Gensler, said in an interview with Bloomberg. ""The casinos in this Wild West are non-compliant intermediaries."" If the comments alone don't motivate crypto firms to get in line, the recent charges against two Sam Bankman-Fried associates might get their attention. On Wednesday, the SEC filed lawsuits against Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, former executives at SBF's Alameda Research, for defrauding investors in FTX, the crypto asset exchange that filed for bankruptcy last month. Both defendants also pled guilty to criminal charges and agreed to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. For months, Gensler has been contending that most digital tokens are unregistered securities that should be following the same rules as other securities exchanges. Problem areas include failing to properly separate different parts of crypto firms' businesses, such as market-making and custody; and client funds often aren't properly segregated. He also questions ""proof of reserves reports,"" which some companies are publishing in an effort to show customers they have enough funds available to back customers' deposits. Such reports don't measure up to regulatory rigor, he said. ""Proof of reserves is neither a full accounting of the assets and liability of a company, nor does it satisfy segregation of customer funds under the securities laws,"" Gensler said. Specifically, crypto firms need to focus on financial recordkeeping, he said. The best way firms can assure customers is by following regulations. ""They should do that by coming into compliance with time-tested custody, segregation of customer funds rules and accounting rules,"" Gensler said. John J. Ray, III, who is overseeing FTX's wind-down, told Congress earlier this month that there were ""virtually no internal controls"" or recordkeeping at the company. Sifting through FTX's operations, its new management has identified more than $1B in cash assets. Earlier, Ray reported his team secured more than $1B in digital assets .

Assets worth 3 million euros were seized during the action by a joint investigation team, Eurojust, the European Union's cross-border agency for fighting organized crime, announced on Dec. 19. More than 160 electronic devices were also seized including computers, servers, digital video recorders and a cellphone.  An organized crime group carried out the operation out of a call center in Tirana, Albania, Eurojust said. Victims were asked to create an account and transfer an initial sum, which showed an immediate financial gain. They were then contacted by the perpetrators posing as brokers ""that proposed advantageous investments in cryptocurrencies with zero risk,"" though it's not clear that any crypto assets were purchased.  Victims were subsequently encouraged to make far larger investments, in some cases their entire economic capital, according to Eurojust. Once the larger deposits were made, the account details were changed and the victims locked out.  Crypto investment scams have proved popular with criminals as they target victims seeking to make sizable short-term financial gains, despite the market's decline this year. That's separate from the use of cryptocurrency, with its perceived lack of traceability, to hide the proceeds of crime. In the U.K., crypto tactical advisers have begun to be stationed in police departments specifically to investigate and seize digital assets linked to crime.  ""We cannot provide further details on this case as the investigation is still ongoing,"" Eurojust told CoinDesk in response for a request for more information.

More than 2,300 readers responded to this week's Wall Street Breakfast poll. Asked where they would deploy most of their investing capital in 2023, a vast majority of readers said ""stocks."" More than 62% of respondents will tilt most of their investments to equities ( NYSEARCA: SPY ) ( QQQ ) ( IWM ) ( URTH ), according to the results. For the more risk averse, cash ( SPRXX ) at 17.5% was a favorite over bonds ( TBT ) ( TLT ) ( SHY ) ( JNK ) ( LQD ) ( BNDW ) at 12.2%, indicating that those investors are skeptical of Fed rate cuts coming next year. The latest Summary of Economic projections ""shows the 'median' FOMCer expects short rates to rise to 5.1%, and remain there for the entirety of 2023 , inflation to remain hundreds of basis points above target through the end of next year, the yield curve to remain in inversion for two more years (given the current level of long rates) and the unemployment rate to 'only' rise 110 bps from recent trough to prospective peak,"" MKM strategist and economist Michael Darda wrote in a note (emphasis his). Rounding out the results, 5.4% said they will put most of their capital to work in commodities ( USO ) ( GLD ) ( DBC ), nudging out crypto ( BTC-USD ) ( ETH-USD ) ( OTC:GBTC ) at 2.7%. Wall Street skeptical : The confidence in stocks from those surveyed is in sharp contrast to the expectations from Wall Street strategists. Strategists expect below-average returns for the S&P 500 ( SP500 ) ( SPY ) in 2023, with many of their colleagues on the economics side predicting a global recession. On average, the 2023 end price target for major Wall Street shops is 4,080, a little less than a 7% rise from current levels. On the top end, Fundstrat's Tom Lee is the most bullish with a target of 4,750. BNP Paribas' Greg Boutle is the most bearish, predicting a drop to 3,400. Among other notable calls, J.P. Morgan's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas is expecting the S&P to close out next year at 4,200, a view also shared by Wells Fargo's Chris Harvey. Goldman Sachs' David Kostin, Citi's Scott Chronert and BofA's Savita Subramanian all predict a mostly sideways year with a target of 4,000.

6221224,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513505,1671790265,Bitcoin Price Poised To Rally Big-Time On Today’s PCE Release,"The Bitcoin price could see a significant uptick today Friday, December 23 at 8:30 am (EST) if the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) comes in better than expected. And the chances are high! Bitcoin price has been heavily dependent on macro data and the decisions of the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) lately. The last FOMC meeting of the year on December 13 provided a bearish surprise, even though the consumer price index (CPI) came in better than expected. However, there was a catch. After the FOMC meeting, rumors emerged that chairman Jerome Powell ignored the CPI data that arrived a few hours before the meeting, although he claimed the opposite in the press conference. Within Wall Street, several analysts spoke out, accusing Powell of hoaxes. Why Today’s Core PCE Is Of Paramount Importance The problem is that the Fed’s forecast for core PCE inflation seems far too high after the surprisingly weak CPI data, as Tomas Lee, an analyst at Fundstrat, writes. As the economic forecast overview shows, the FED raised the core PCE inflation target for 2022 from 4.5% to 4.8%. With that, Powell added to the “higher for longer” narrative. But there is something “odd,” as Lee explained. The month-to-month percentage change in inflation would have to be staggeringly high to reach the FED’s 4.8% target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Shows Signs of Life and Could Soon Clear This Hurdle Lee wonders how the FED can forecast 4.8% core PCE inflation in 2022 when inflation is moving toward 4.1-4.2%. “How can Fed forecast be so far??” Lee wrote. The analyst points to a ransomware attack on Haver Analytics as a possible reason for this large divergence. Due to the attack, Haver Analytics may not have been able to update the data, which is why Jerome Powell and the FOMC committee ignored the positive data. Therefore, according to the Fundstrat analyst, today’s PCE release is of massive importance. Lee writes: We think core PCE inflation will be 0.10% compared to Cleveland Fed inflation NOW forecast of 0.26%. Any figure below 0.40% would make #FOMC figure of 4.8% too high. Remarkably, the PCE is also the key data point for the U.S. central bank. The FED’s forecasts and its 2% target are not based on CPI, but on the PCE. Twitter user ZeroHedge estimated based on this fact: If tomorrow’s core PCE is 4.5% or lower (~75% chance), the entire hawkish FOMC repricing is blown out – no way 4.8% core PCE in December, SEP/Dots repriced and terminal rate tumbles. The Impact On The Bitcoin Price If the PCE is significantly below the FED’s expectations, the theory would find confirmation today and could completely wipe out the bearish sentiment. The FED would possibly be forced to revise its forecasts as the PCE shows that inflation is under control. This could prompt the FED to take a more dovish stance at the next meeting, with markets front-running this as early as today. Ultimately, the PCE release could lead to a weaker dollar, spurring risk assets like Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Will Spike By End 2022, Which Way Will It Push BTC? At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $16,827. Today, like the last few days, the $16,900 level will be of key importance as the most crucial resistance at the moment. If there is a strong push above this resistance, the next target would be the $17,400 region. Otherwise, Bitcoin investors should keep an eye on the support at $16,400.

42413355,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8UH8,1671786243,"OKX Unveils 2nd Proof-of-Reserves Report, Promises Monthly Publication","Cryptocurrency exchange OKX published a second proof-of-reserves (PoR) report, adding features that allow users to verify that the second-largest platform by trading volume has sufficient assets to handle customer withdrawals.  The report, released Thursday, shows that as of Tuesday, 12:00 UTC, OKX's wallets held 113,754 bitcoin (US$1.87 billion) against a user balance of 112,192 bitcoin (BTC). That's a bitcoin reserve ratio of 101%, a slight decline from 102% disclosed in the first report released on Nov. 22.  The reserve ratio for leading stablecoin tether (USDT) held steady at 101%, while ether's (ETH) reserve ratio ticked higher to 103% from 102%. The exchange addresses tracked by analytics firm Nansen show BTC, ETH and USDT make up over 90% of holdings.  Proof of reserves is an audit method adopted by cryptocurrency exchanges in the aftermath of FTX's collapse to prove that the custodian, in this case OKX, isn't lending out customer funds, as FTX did, and has the assets it claims to hold on behalf of its users. These reports have, nevertheless, been criticized for not providing information about liabilities and internal quality controls, a focal point in the crypto community. For instance, Binance's recent proof of reserves report from French audit firm Mazars was criticized for lack of details about the way exchange liquidates assets to cover margin loans.  OKX said in a press release shared with CoinDesk that it would release proof of funds on the 22nd day of each month to win customer trust and allow users to audit its 23,000 addresses, which the exchange plans to continue using in the future.  Users can now view and download the old and new reserve ratios and assess the exchange's health and the safety of their assets.  “Publishing PoR results on a monthly basis strengthens our commitment to lead the industry when it comes to transparency and trust,” Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique said in the release. “At OKX, we believe that PoR should be verifiable via open source tools so that users can self-verify the balances and ownership of our reserve addresses.”",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SPONSORED | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/23/okx-unveils-second-proof-of-reserves-report-promises-monthly-publication,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d003f2d735240fdcd6b6ae27cdf7ffd3bf5251dc-2504x1216.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413352,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8UFG,1671785760,SEC Increases Scrutiny of Audits of Cryptocurrency Companies: WSJ,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is increasing its scrutiny of audits of cryptocurrency companies in an effort to warn investors who may feel assured by audits such as proof-of-reserve reports, according to a Wall Street Journal report that cites a senior SEC official.  “Investors should not place too much confidence in the mere fact a company says it’s got a proof-of-reserves from an audit firm,” said Paul Munter, the SEC’s acting chief accountant. Having such a report “is not enough information for an investor to assess whether the company has sufficient assets to cover its liabilities,” he added.  In the aftermath of FTX's collapse as many as nine crypto exchanges across the world announced they would publish transparency reports or Merkle tree proof of reserves to reassure spooked investors. A Merkle tree proof of reserves is a cryptographic data structure that maintains privacy but allows users to verify the stability of their holdings on exchanges, thereby creating trust.  The SEC is warning both investors and audit firms that if it finds troublesome ""fact patterns,"" the watchdog will consider a referral to the division of enforcement, according to Munter.  The development assumes significance as questions have been swirling regarding Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, that did release a report of its proof of reserves but it was withdrawn two days later when the auditing firm it had hired, Mazars, announced it was no longer working with crypto firms.  According to the WSJ report, Binance was looking for another audit firm after it was dropped by Mazars. Binance “reached out to multiple large firms, including the Big Four (Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC), who are currently unwilling to conduct a [proof of reserves] for a private crypto company,” the company said.

That probably isn’t good news.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Whispers in the dark  The narrative  QuadrigaCX is back in the news! For those of you who weren’t here back then: A Canadian crypto exchange collapsed in dramatic fashion in January 2019 after its founder apparently passed away in India due to complications from Crohn’s disease.  Why it matters  It turned out the exchange owed thousands of customers around $200 million in crypto (at prices at the time). It later came out that the exchange’s founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, had misappropriated customer funds for personal purposes. He also left behind little paperwork or records, making it difficult for investigators to actually verify what assets or liabilities Quadriga had... Sound familiar?  Breaking it down  That’s ancient history by current standards. Ernst and Young, a Big Four auditor, is acting as the company’s bankruptcy trustee and has spent much of the last 3+ years investigating Quadriga, trying to find the company’s assets and recover what funds it could. The Canada Revenue Agency is also digging into Quadriga, checking on taxes the exchange may not have filed when it was operating.  Early on, in February 2019, EY revealed it had accidentally sent over 100 bitcoin (BTC) to what it described as Quadriga’s cold wallets, which it could not access.  Last Friday, someone pulled all 104 BTC out. And promptly moved at least 70 or so of that to Wasabi Wallet, a privacy service. EY confirmed it wasn’t anyone on the auditor’s team, implying someone has either had access to these wallets for the last four years or someone found the keys after nearly four years. Either way, it’s yet another blow to the crypto exchange, which is still going through its bankruptcy proceedings.  Crypto analytics firm Chainalysis said the movements are similar to bitcoin that left defunct trading service BTC-e’s wallets a few weeks ago.  This is obviously not great news. EY and Miller Thomson, the law firm representing Quadriga creditors, did not return requests for comment earlier this week. In nearly identical statements, the two firms said they were investigating the “unauthorized transactions.”  A number of questions will have to be answered. Why did EY believe the addresses in question were cold wallets, and what work have they done over the past four years to try and verify that they couldn’t find the keys?  Furthermore, the case at this point appears to be held up largely by the Canada Revenue Agency, but EY hasn’t published any reports on the bankruptcy case since January 2021, and its last notice to creditors was in February 2021. Crypto prices have changed dramatically since then, so it’s unclear what exactly creditors will recover.

While he was in the air, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams announced that Bankman-Fried’s former associates – onetime Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX-co-founder Gary Wang – had pleaded guilty to various charges and were cooperating with prosecutors.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin avoids losses in U.S. stocks as strong economic data makes investors reconsider expectations that the Federal Reserve will pivot anytime soon to a more dovish monetary policy.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin dodges stock sell-off  By Bradley Keoun  Bitcoin (BTC) was flat over the past 24 hours, on a day where U.S. stocks sold off. Positive economic data rekindled fears that the Federal Reserve may need to keep tightening monetary policy longer than expected – a trend that has put downward pressure on risky asset prices all year. (Check out Glenn Williams Jr.'s analysis here.)  The largest cryptocurrency by market volume was trading above $16,800, down just 0.01% over 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the second largest, was trading around $1,223, up 0.82%. The CoinDesk Market Index was up 0.5%  Messari's Ryan Selkis, in a 168-page report on his 2023 predictions, wrote the market's direction is ""still all about macro and regulation.""  ""The resting market sentiment is that we will have a recession in 2023, with some debate over its potential magnitude. The market also seems to trust that central banks will continue to tighten until inflation is under control. Though contrarian, there are some investors who think it’s more likely that the Fed will pivot once the recession really gets going and accept multi-year high inflation in lieu of a depression or global reserve currency crisis.""  Insights  Web3, DeFi at the center of Indonesian CBDC  By Glenn Ardi, CoinDesk Indonesia  The Central Bank of Indonesia’s white paper about the development of the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) stands in contrast to China’s: It envisions a world where the government permits, and controls, Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) by providing a government-sanctioned payment layer instead of trying to eliminate it.  Indonesia’s population has fully embraced crypto. Based on data from the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Authority (Bappebti), the number of registered crypto accounts hit 16.3 million as of September 2022, with a year-over-year growth rate of 81.6%.  While the Central Bank of Indonesia sees some negative parts to crypto, such as the ability for it to operate as a ""shadow central bank,"" it knows it needs to work on keeping up, but also not getting in the way either, and with that it's developing a digital form of the Rupiah known as Project Garuda, Indonesia’s CBDC. At this point, crypto is too big in Indonesia to ban, so why not work with the industry and provide regulated payment layers, the prevailing logic goes.  “[A] CBDC fills the gap left by existing money by acting as the core instrument for central banks to maintain monetary and financial system stability within digital ecosystem,” a whitepaper from the Bank on the CBDC reads.  The bank envisions a market where crypto exists as part of a broader ecosystem, with on-ramps to and from CBDC.  “Activities within the Web 3.0 ecosystem, including crypto asset transactions, also add to the complexity of controlling financial systems, both in the context of mitigating micro-financial and macro-financial risks,” the paper reads. “Central banks would need to find a future-proof solution to maintain public trust in them with regards to carrying out their mandate in the digital era.”  The Indonesian CBDC, according to the white paper, will be the method of settlement for traditional and digital ecosystem including DeFi, the metaverse and Web3. Cryptocurrency is fine, the prevailing thought seems to go, provided that a digital form of the Rupiah is the dominant means of settlement.  This stands in contrast to China’s approach. The country has largely banned most kinds of cryptocurrencies and prohibits crypto transactions almost entirely. The People’s Bank of China white paper on its CBDC mentions cryptocurrency as a concern but takes particular issue with stablecoins, saying they will bring “risks and challenges” to the global financial system.  But for Indonesia, stablecoins aren’t a problem. The country already has a handful of rupiah-backed stablecoins such as the BIDR, IDRT or IDK. A big market for these stablecoins is Indonesia’s large diaspora of migrant workers as overseas remittances is a big source of income for the country.  In theory, a CBDC could be swapped for a stablecoin, then sent abroad. This method would also have the benefit of allowing authorities to monitor for tax compliance.  Still, all this is a long way from being finalized. “The current whitepaper is still high level and theoretical and plans to be implemented,” Asih Karnengsih, chairwoman of Indonesia Blockchain Association, told CoinDesk. “The implementation of the CBDC will take many stakeholders to be involved and the real challenge will be how to invite these stakeholders to join the CBDC system.”  But there are security risks  A CBDC means that the government would have a lot of information on transactions and users. And Indonesia doesn’t have the best record for IT security.  In January 2022, the Central Bank of Indonesia suffered a ransomware attack that resulted in 74.82 GB of data being leaked. A few months later the country’s national electoral commission was hacked, and the personal information of 105 million Indonesian citizens was sold on the dark web. This comes two years after the same department was hacked, resulting in a leak of 2.3 million voter records.  Considering the government’s poor track record of IT security, is it really a good idea to give them so much more information? A CBDC would have details about every transaction a person makes. What price would that fetch on the dark web?

The growth of the crypto space will likely be handicapped for the foreseeable future with the risk of regulatory blowback likely to keep some institutions away. The company's depositary-preferred shares offer an alternative way to play a potential recovery. Silvergate Capital's ( SI ) push to offer banking services to the crypto space in 2014 retrospectively looked like a masterstroke. The company would IPO in 2019 just ahead of the pandemic-led surge of crypto and its inherent explosion into the mainstream on the back of an unprecedented level of institutional adoption. But the party is now over and the collapse of Silvergate's common shares this year has been built on the seemingly bleak future ahead for crypto. The near 40% short interest in the La Jolla, California-based company is reflective of just how much bears believe this new future will play out. To them, what lies ahead is a long dark crypto winter where the current list of 2022 bankruptcies grows even longer . Silvergate's depositors are already filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy. FTX on the 11th of November, Alameda Research on the 11th of November, and BlockFi on the 28th of November. Bulls would be right to state that Silvergate's total digital asset customer deposit exposure to some of these companies like BlockFi was small at $20 million but this would miss the bigger picture. Silvergate has so far in November become a financial layer for an industry realizing a structural decline. The chartered and FDIC-insured bank with an account at the Federal Reserve is now currently subject to a class action lawsuit over its alleged role in transferring FTX user deposits to Alameda bank accounts. Whilst the fundamental bearish point is that the FTX debacle will significantly hamper institutional adoption of crypto, the worst-case scenario for Silvergate could be realized if the company loses its charter over its FTX-Alameda dealings. The New Crypto Landscape Is Hostile It's important to note that there are a lot of allegations flying around and some of them might not be reflective of the truth. Hence, the lawsuit is important as it would allow the company to more transparently defend itself and more clearly separate fact from fiction. Silvergate currently faces the specter of regulatory blowback with US Senators Elizabeth Warren, Roger Marshall, and John Kennedy writing to the bank to seek answers on its role in the FTX collapse. With the SEC looking to more heavily Bitcoin as a security and more states looking to place more onerous regulations on crypto activity, the growth rates Silvergate has historically seen will likely be in the rearview mirror. For example, New York State-registered banks will now need to receive regulatory permission 90 days before they get involved in crypto even if it's via a third party. Whilst enhanced regulation could be good for the industry and increase its legitimacy, the current sentiment leans towards the regulations looking more reactionary. Indeed, the FTX debacle has been a total disaster with billions of lost customer funds likely pushing regulators to move to rein in the type of crypto activities that drove Silvergate's deposit growth. Prospective investors might be interested in the company's 5.375% Depositary Shares ( SI.PA ) which represent an alternative way to gain exposure. Quite confusingly, the company does not describe these as preferred shares but as depositary shares which represent a 1/40 interest in a share of the fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. QuantumOnline These currently trade at $10.90, which is around $14.10 or 56.4% below their $25 redemption value. They also currently pay out a $1.34 annual coupon which amounts to a 12.33% dividend yield with a call date quite a while away on the 15th of August 2026. As the commons don't pay a dividend and against the deep discount to redemption value, the 1/40 of a preferred depository shares offer an alternative way to gain exposure to Silvergate's potential recovery. However, it's important to note that the depositary shares are non-cumulative. This represents one of the least attractive structures as the company can choose to suspend the dividend at any time and the unpaid dividends will not accumulate to be paid fully at a later date. Cumulative preferred shares are designed to reduce the probability of dividends being suspended during times of economic discombobulation, hence, holders of these could find themselves out of income in the event the slowdown in the crypto space translates to a marked disruption of Silvergate's financials. Every Day Is For The Bull, One Day Is For The Bear Morgan Stanley recently slashed its 2023 EPS estimates for Silvergate by 51% to $4.48 compared with the broader analyst consensus of earnings of $5.95 per share. Silvergate's digital deposit balance is also expected to fall by 20% sequentially during its fiscal 2022 fourth quarter from $11.9 billion in its last reported third quarter. The company's revenue for its third quarter of $89.34 million grew by a staggering 72.8% over the year-ago period but was a miss by $11 million on consensus estimates. Digital asset customers reached 1,677, up from 1,305 in the year-ago comp and was a growth of 5.8% sequentially. A potentially lower deposit balance represents the greatest risk to EPS as Silvergate does not pay any interest to its depositors. Silvergate Capital The company's Silvergate Exchange Network, which allows crypto companies to transfer dollars any time of day, is already in decline and fell by 30% year-over-year to handle $112.6 billion of US dollar transfers. The FTX debacle and the ongoing retrenchment of the industry from the recent bankruptcy of one of North America's largest miners Core Scientific ( CORZ ) to the near-distressed valuation of most listed miners and the suspension of withdrawals by Gemini all point to a bleak near-term future. Hence, whilst the price-to-forward GAAP earnings ratio of 4x looks attractive, earnings might very well turn negative depending on the severity of the industry's pullback. The valuation is too low here to recommend this as a short, but it's equally not a buy until there is more clarity over the lawsuit and the regulatory response.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4566076-silvergate-depositors-filing-chapter-11s?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6194872.jpeg

The exchange has remained strong in the face of adversity. I rate BNB, the exchange's token, a strong buy. This article was co-authored by Mandela Amoussou What You May Have Missed All eyes are on Binance ( BNB-USD ) following rumors of potential FTX-like insolvency at the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. At the onset of the FTX ( FTT-USD ) collapse following the report released by CoinDesk that showed assets to liability mismatch on Alameda Research’s (FTX trading arm) balance sheet, Binance was quick to announce it will liquidate all of its FTT (FTX's token) holdings. There was a Twitter ( TWTR ) back and forth between the CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao (known by the initials CZ) and Sam Bankman-Fried (""SBF""), the fallen CEO of FTX. Binance’s exit triggered more sell-off of crypto-assets by FTX customers, leading to the opening of a can of worms at FTX, and a subsequent bank-run-like implosion. Since the FTX fiasco, Binance is one of the entities constantly reassuring the crypto community—via tweets, published statements, and novel initiatives—that not every centralized exchange (CEX) has the underlying problems FTX had. The reassurances via tweets and statements have not quelled the weeks-long FUD surrounding major CEX, including Binance. Last week, customer outflows from Binance exceeded $3 billion, including withdrawals of about $2 billion in a single day. As the largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance has been under scrutiny by the crypto community and lawmakers in certain jurisdictions where it operates. The crypto community seems to be on the alert as a result of the FTX surprise collapse last month. Quest for Transparency: Merkle Tree Proof-of-Reserves Audit The recent insolvency and implosions in the crypto industry have pushed the demand for greater transparency in the crypto space. One of the steps towards transparency that CEX have taken is to make third-party financial audits public via Proof of Reserves (""POR""). Binance was one of the first crypto exchanges to publish its PoR after the collapse of FTX. On November 22, auditing and accounting firm Mazars took a snapshot of assets on Binance including customers’ spot, options, margin, futures, funding, loan and earn accounts for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC-USD ) held on the Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), BNB Chain and Binance Smart Chain blockchains. Mazars' audit of Binance’s assets on November 22, 2022, showed that Binance was 101% collateralized. Binance had enough assets to cover all of the users’ funds on the exchange and a little extra. Other crypto exchanges audited by Mazars include Crypto.com and KuCoin. In the latest developments, Mazars has deleted the reports related to crypto firms' audits on its official website. Mazars, in a report, said that crypto-related audit works are now put on hold. Mazars cited concerns regarding how the public understands these reports and the intense media scrutiny the reports have generated. The concerns were cited in an email from Mazars, according to a Bloomberg report. Mazars' withdrawal and the hesitation of other big auditing firms to provide auditing services to crypto exchanges are largely seen as a way to maintain their reputation as most of these auditing firms fear being entangled in an FTX-like collapse. In a recent CNBC interview, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said, “Many audit firms are scared to work with crypto businesses."" The news of Mazars' withdrawal of its published audits resulted in some FUD, causing price drops in BNB (Binance ecosystem native coin) and other altcoins. Lawmakers Probe Binance As the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance is the subject of scrutiny by lawmakers in different jurisdictions where the exchange operates. Authorities in Singapore commenced an ongoing investigation into Binance, accusing the crypto exchange of a possible breach of local payment services rules, Bloomberg reported. US prosecutors are looking into Binance and its activities. Sources who spoke to Reuters say the US Department of Justice (DoJ) is mulling over the decision to file charges against Binance and its top executives, including CEO Changpeng Zhao. Prosecutors are, however, divided on whether to file charges immediately based on gathered evidence or wait until more concrete evidence is obtained. The potential charges stem from a 2018 investigation related to Binance's compliance with US anti-money laundering laws, according to sources who spoke with Reuters. Binance's attorneys are said to have negotiated a plea deal with DoJ authorities, fearing the catastrophic effect a criminal charge will have on the crypto market which is yet to recover from the FTX contagion. Binance to the Rescue In the crypto space, Binance has continued to play a leadership role during times of crisis. Following the implosion of FTX, Binance announced an initiative it calls the industry recovery initiative (""IRI""). Binance made a $1 billion initial IRI commitment; other key industry players, including Polygon Ventures, Aptos Labs, Animoca Brands, and Jump Crypto, have made contributions to the initiative. In a similar vein, Binance.us—the US-based subsidiary of Binance—is set to acquire Voyager Digital (VYGVQ) for $1 billion as part of Voyager's chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Voyager filed for bankruptcy in July. The TerraLUNA-induced implosion of Three Arrows Capital (3AC); 3AC, a crypto hedge fund, owed Voyager funds which it couldn't repay. Is BNB worth the risk? Binance is one of the crypto entities that face a lot of scrutiny in the industry. The news of possible criminal charges by US prosecutors last week created FUD, (fear, uncertainty and doubt) leading to huge customer outflows from the exchange. Data analytics firm CryptoQuant has said it has performed an analysis of Binance's proof-of-reserves audit and has ascertained that the reserves are truly accounted for, backing the now-expunged audit report of Mazars. BNB, the native coin of Binance, is an important crypto asset in the Binance ecosystem. BNB undergoes periodic buybacks and burns by Binance, a process the firm says will continue until 50% of the BNB supply is burnt. The introduction of BEP-95 has also added to the deflationary mechanism of BNB. Generally, in crypto, the more deflationary mechanism a coin has, the more it tends to maintain its value. From a purely fundamental perspective, BNB is certainly a valuable coin. Unlike, say, FTT or other coins that support an ecosystem, BNB is regularly burned, and the Binance Smart Chain is popular with many developers, as it allows for fast transactions. The big issue here is how Binance will deal with attacks from centralized powers. Binance operates from Hong Kong but was originally a Chinese company. This might be one of the reasons why it is not looked at so favourably in the West, and regulation could make it difficult for Binance to continue growing. Still, I see Binance building a powerful crypto ecosystem. The crypto exchange and its strong team seem to always push the exchange to a greater height despite the FUD and criticisms. Takeaway Binance has shown it can hold on strong, despite the accelerated withdrawals, and I have even verified this myself, withdrawing funds from the exchange as a test. Like in any industry, there are good companies and bad. FTX turned out to be not so great, but Binance is doing things right, and I personally use the exchange and hold BNB. With that said, minimizing the funds held in centralized exchanges is always a smart idea.",NEUTRAL,BTC | BNB | FTT,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | BNB | FTT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4566073-binance-staying-strong-in-face-of-adversity?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6194477.jpeg

Auditor halts work and critics talk of a 'black box' A DOJ investigation adds further negative sentiment. As the dust settles on the collapse of the FTX (FTT-USD) cryptocurrency exchange, attention has now turned to the financial soundness of the Binance exchange. In this article, I will dig deeper into the finances and criticism of Binance and the outlook for the BNB token ( BNB-USD ). Binance is under pressure over its finances It has been a year of hero-turned-villain in the cryptocurrency market. In the summer of 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried was likened by Fortune to John Pierpont Morgan for bailing out crypto firms in the bear market. Six months later and he is under arrest after being extradited to the U.S. with his $32 billion empire now in messy bankruptcy proceedings. The rival Binance exchange, and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, is now facing a similar predicament. It was CZ who triggered the initial run on the FTX exchange and its ultimate collapse when he announced that his firm was selling all of its FTT tokens- the native coin of the FTX exchange. As FTX collapsed, Binance was left standing at the top of the mountain with its CEO preaching about how to handle customer funds. Only a month later, it is Zhao who is having to deflect concerns over the soundness of his exchange. Binance would be a big scalp and could lead to an even bigger fallout than FTX. The company has a daily trading volume of $7.8 billion, which is huge compared to its nearest big-name rival Coinbase ( COIN ), which has $1.1 billion. Last week, Binance saw its highest daily withdrawals since June, with net outflows of $3 billion in a 24-hour period, according to Nansen. Investors are spooked over reserves and audits The problems started for Binance last week when the audit company Mazars removed a web page related to its work with Binance and said that it had halted its work on “proof of reserves” reporting, with Binance, Crypto.com, and KuCoin. Mazars said it had “paused its activity relating to the provision of proof of reserves reports for entities in the cryptocurrency sector due to concerns regarding how these reports are understood by the public”. The reports were said to be limited in scope compared to a traditional audit of company accounts and the company was distancing itself from the media attention, according to the Financial Times. Michael Burry, the famed investor of the “Big Short” film, tweeted : In 2005 when I started using a new kind of credit default swap, our auditors were learning on the job. That's not a good thing. Same goes for FTX, Binance, etc. The audit is essentially meaningless. A month ago, Nansen reported that Binance held $69.5 billion in digital assets in publicly disclosed wallets. That total was now said to be around $54.7 billion due to large withdrawals and price fluctuations. Nansen analyst Andrew Thurman told Coindesk that Binance’s finances were still, “ very much a black box .” After Reuters released an article with a similar accusation, Binance hit back in a blog post but did not seem to want to increase transparency over the firm’s finances. Binance said that it “does not need” to disclose detailed information on its financial status as it is not publicly traded. The company stated it was self-sufficient and “financially healthy,” with “no external financing needs and external investors, and no intention to go public at this stage.” A DOJ money laundering investigation adds extra weight Another headwind over the last two weeks was news that the Department of Justice (DOJ) was considering whether to file criminal charges against Binance over money laundering accusations. The investigation began in 2018 and Reuters said , “Some of the at least half dozen federal prosecutors involved in the case believe the evidence already gathered justifies moving aggressively against the exchange and filing criminal charges against individual executives including founder Changpeng Zhao, said two of the sources. Others have argued taking time to review more evidence.” “The stakes are high for the deeply troubled crypto sector. If the investigation goes against Binance and Zhao, it could loosen Binance's grip on the industry,” they added. Zhao seeks to reassure investors and staff Changpeng Zhao tried to reassure Binance’s army of retail investors in an email, saying : We only spend our own funds. We do not use client funds to deal on our own account. Zhao added: Binance holds all of its clients’ crypto-assets in segregated accounts which are identified separately from any accounts used to hold crypto-assets belonging to Binance and it also uses Binance’s own wallet infrastructure to safeguard user assets and Binance’s own assets. This is where the story gets interesting as CZ seems to believe that all will be well at Binance because they do not trade or spend users’ funds. That is true, but the company still holds the majority of its assets in its native token, just like FTX did. Client funds may be protected, but the fate of the exchange’s operations is a different story. The price of Binance Coin has been under pressure since the late-November crypto peak but is still in a bearish tone despite the reassurances of the exchange’s management team. BNB-USD ((M)) (TradingView) On the monthly chart, support is at $200-210 and if that gives way, all hell could break out in the cryptocurrency sector once more. Conclusion Just as Binance appeared to be left standing alone at the top of the mountain as king of the crypto exchanges, the company is coming under fire from all angles. A DOJ investigation into money laundering, dropped by its auditor and now fielding regular questions over its reserves. The market is looking for assurances that the company is in sound financial health. The company's response that they are not publicly listed and not required to disclose such details is not what investors are looking for. Binance may not trade client funds, but a large number of its reserves are held in its native BNB token and that could ultimately threaten its operations.",NEGATIVE,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ICO | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4566068-binance-waiting-for-other-shoe-to-drop?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6193552.jpeg
