Bitcoin Netflow And Stablecoins Supply Ratio Trends Look Similar To Q4 2020 As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, two BTC indicators: the netflow and the stablecoins supply ratio, are both trending similarly to how they did during the last quarter of 2020. The Bitcoin netflow indicator shows the net number of coins entering or exiting exchanges. Its value is calculated by taking the difference between the outflows and the inflows. When the metric observes positive values, it means exchanges are experiencing more inflows than the outflows, and so more investors have started sending their BTC to exchanges for selling purposes. Similarly, negative values imply just the opposite; investors are withdrawing their Bitcoin from exchanges either to hodl in personal wallets or to sell them through OTC deals. The other metric of relevance is the stablecoins supply ratio, which is defined as the market cap of BTC divided by the market cap of all stablecoins. When the indicator&apos;s values are on the lower end, it means there is an abundance of stablecoins supply in the market. High supplies can imply a potentially bullish sentiment among the market as investors use these coins for picking up other crypto like BTC.

42396834,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT5cWl,1633027192,Can Crypto Put a Price on Community?,"Crypto-backed online communities are constantly wrestling with speculation. Take DAOs, or “decentralized autonomous organizations,” which use crypto tokens like access keys – a bot confirms the requisite tokens are in your wallet before letting you into a private Discord server, where the organization awaits.  Rallying around shared ownership of a token can incentivize development and community building, but as the price of the token increases, the group inevitably ends up weighing the value of continued membership against the value of cashing out. The crypto market never sleeps, and neither do token prices. How should community members feel if the price of admission shoots up 10-fold overnight?  This is more or less what happened to Crypto Packaged Goods (CPG), a new community that’s betting big on the long-term value of mentorship. A limited supply of 250 non-fungible tokens works as access keys. At press time, the lowest price for one of those NFTs on the secondary market (that’s the “floor” in crypto speak) was 2.4 ETH, or around $7,000. When they launched earlier this week, the tokens cost just 0.2 ETH apiece.  Orchestrated by Color Capital, a small venture capital firm investing in consumer-focused companies like The Sill (direct-to-order houseplants) and Salt & Straw (ice cream), CPG is, for now, just a private channel on the messaging app Telegram. But there’s power behind that unassuming facade. CPG looks to marry the world of crypto with the world of consumer goods, shepherding Web3 educators, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs into a single chat room.  Read More: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  Jaime Schmidt and Chris Cantino, the wife-and-husband duo behind Color Capital, say the CPG Telegram channel is built around mentorship. “We started with identifying 50 ‘mentors’ who we thought would be nice, big names that people would be excited to chat with in our Telegram,” Schmidt said. The list includes some of Crypto Twitter’s heaviest hitters, from influencers (Jackson Dame), to investors (Jarrod Dicker, Packy McCormick), to do-anything entrepreneurs (Cooper Turley).  The idea was to get people talking about the relationship between crypto and consumer goods. Industry experts would act as go-betweens, helping newcomers negotiate some of Web3′s notoriously high barriers to entry.  The “mentors” were each given two NFTs: one for themselves and one for regifting to a potential new member. There were also 150 more access NFTs designated for the public. Within an hour of the announcement, Cantino said, the public NFTs were sold out.  Things get a little more chaotic once you’re actually in the Telegram group (Cantino airdropped me an NFT so that I could access the channel, which I’ve since returned). Moments after I joined, messages began to whiz by – because CPG is structured as a single feed, these messages flow almost constantly, without a filter. A few members discussed which NFT projects they found the most promising. One toasted National Coffee Day with a celebratory GIF. Two others resolved to discuss a potential business opportunity at a later date. At one point, Cantino circulated a survey meant to “identify networking opportunities within the group.”  Part of the goal, according to Color Capital, was to set CPG apart from token-centric communities in the vein of Bored Ape Yacht Club – the collection of NFT profile pictures (or “PFPs”) that has spawned a nascent media empire. “There are so many PFP projects that have been really extractive of their communities,” Cantino said. “The incentives are aligned for everybody to pump, or encourage each other to hold, or drive up the price.”  It’s not uncommon for NFTs to have a community aspect. Developers are constantly spinning off token-gated chat rooms for their projects (see Bitmap, Loot and and Nouns). But a lot of that value is hypothetical: NFT developers make all sorts of promises about the future of their communities (so-called “road maps” are par for the course with PFP collections), but there are no guarantees.  The difference here, Cantino explained, is that “the value is already baked in.”  Read More: The Latest NFT Fad Is a Text-Based Fantasy Game Building Block  “The non-ETH value is that in this group, with all these great people, you could make a relationship that changed your life. You could meet a mentor that invested in your startup. You could meet somebody that just gave you that one piece of advice, and then everything clicked.”  One of the challenges posed by this model is there’s nothing to keep the channel centered on that intersection of Web3 and consumer goods, beyond the meat of the conversation itself. Whether Color Capital succeeds in fostering a community with those shared goals will depend on how successfully Schmidt and Cantino can organize events and marshal group discussions.  Schmidt and Cantino also plan to give members access to something called the “Club CPG Investment Vehicle,” which will let “accredited investors” get an early shot at investing in startups. In that sense, an NFT access key for CPG becomes a direct opportunity to make more money down the line.  This is where speculation comes into play. What is CPG’s take on mentorship really worth? An NFT that comes bundled with intel on potentially lucrative NFT projects and startups probably has more going for it than the sticker price suggests.  Someone with the alias “Uncle Rick,” also known as “icculus.eth,” bought 10 access NFTs on Monday for 0.2 ETH each and is still hanging onto them. My first instinct was that they were looking to flip them for a quick buck, but they told me over Telegram they were considering selling the NFTs directly to “people [they] keep in high regard in the space.” It’s a combination of speculation and curation – sharing the love over the counter.  Cantino insists that the value of membership goes beyond the numbers.  “Paying entry fees for token-gated communities is essentially providing ‘proof of funds,’ he tweeted yesterday, just after our conversation. “You don’t ‘lose’ that money when you buy in – you exchange it for tokens at market value. You are staking funds in exchange for membership that can be sold back later.”  That is an optimistic view; most would probably say that you do, literally, “lose” money when that $7,000 leaves your checking account. And it’s hard not to bristle at the idea of spending that much for access to a chat room. But unlike with a concert ticket, or a subscription to a network of physical spaces (like The Wing), the money isn’t exactly gone after you’ve swapped it for an NFT; it’s just been invested.  As long as people remain interested in CPG, members who want out can just flip their NFTs on the secondary market. Think of it like a venture capital firm exiting its position in a startup after making an initial investment: Whether you make money is a measure of the project’s success.  “Maybe you get hired and you find your dream job, or you just get some great advice,” Cantino said of his plans for the group. “That can be worth so much more than the price of entry.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/30/can-crypto-put-a-price-on-community,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e988a2837ef423c1968c831b960a8803581d9a0-7952x5304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421722,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpGUX,1633021500,Gary Gensler Says Crypto Is a ‘Wild West.’ Others See Pure Capitalism,"Gary Gensler, from up high on his regulatory perch at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is arguing for greater oversight of crypto. He calls the sector the “Wild West,” inviting comparisons to the outlaw days of frontier capitalism.  It’s a nice metaphor. Is it apt? Crypto is indisputably tied up in the greater financial system. And some may argue that because of loose monetary policy and an overabundance of cheap cash, crypto does sit at the fringes of some portfolios of those investors looking to outperform the market.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But if crypto is on the map at all, it’s because the market has made it so. With yields on cash near zero, the “risk curve” has shifted – stocks are the new savings accounts, memes the new stocks and crypto the new bet for venture capital. People gotta get paid to save.  Crypto’s relationship to unfettered capitalism is complicated. A charitable interpretation is that the industry is committed to its libertarian roots. Experimentation is welcome, and with that come outsized risks and rewards. That’s why regulation is often viewed with derision or suspision, the range between saying “code is law” or “the rules need to be clearer.”  “Crypto today presents itself as both the wild wild west fringe, and the inevitable future of mainstream finance. But the kind of volatility and riskiness that is tolerable at the fringe isn’t necessarily tolerable at the core,” says Rohan Grey, an assistant professor of law at Willamette University.  The current, dominant economic regime in the U.S. is nominally capitalist, but in practice, it is something far afield. Government actors and the unelected Federal Reserve have long been in the business of picking and choosing winners in the market – sometimes directly. Regulation is often treated as a moat for powerful incumbents. If crypto is the Wild West, then traditional finance is the protectionism, cronyism and decadence of early modern Western Europe.  By comparison, crypto is a textbook example of “free enterprise.” It is a global financial architecture that anyone with internet access can use. It runs 24/7, it’s liquid, and it has winners and losers determined by the rules of the game. As yet, there are few intermediaries to intermediate bad outcomes.  When liquidity crises happen, people get liquidated. Businesses go bankrupt. Exchanges go down. People lose in proportion to the risks they take. Those are market forces functioning according to the rules. People may get hurt.  “This crypto space is now certainly of a size that without those investor protections of banking, insurance[and] securities laws [and] market oversight, I do think somebody is going to get hurt,” Gensler told the Financial Times Wednesday. “A lot of people are likely to get hurt.”  Recently, in crypto, there have been a number of instances where bad or ambiguous actors capitalized on the misfortune of others. So-called decentralized platforms are often more centralized than advertised, leaving backdoors for knowledgable people to exploit. And hastily written code is often ridden with unintentional errors.  Read more: DeFi Money Market Compound Overpays Millions in COMP Rewards in Possible Exploit; Founder Says $80M at Risk  Take the Poly Network hacker, who stole $600 million from a decentralized lending protocol, taking advantage of poorly written code. In a strange turn of events, the hacker decided to return the stolen funds. The circumstances around that are murky, but it appears the parties involved worked out an agreeable solution.  That is happening more and more in crypto. In the Poly Network situation, the hacker may have feared being turned in to financial authorities, which seemed plausible – a point in favor of the regulatory state. But the hacker or hackers may also have been concerned about lasting reputational damage in the industry or realized that their stolen funds were blacklisted, and made unusable, by exchanges. In other words, market forces were at work.  In a similar situation, this one involving financial titan Citigroup and cosmetic firm Revlon, a fat finger error cost the bank almost $500 million – without recourse.  In 2018, while teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Gensler noted the importance of “marrying” innovative financial technologies with regulation. Recently, he’s said that the majority of cryptocurrencies are likely securities, meaning vast swaths of this $2 trillion market would be under the SEC’s remit.  Now I like Gary Gensler. As a professor at MIT, he cited deep cuts from Satoshi’s emails. He genuinely seems concerned about financial stability and consumer protections. He’s remarkably consistent: During that same lecture, he seemed miffed that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission entered “sufficiently decentralized” into the lexicon, an opaque, post-hoc qualification relating to the Ethereum initial coin offering. He fears that the standard could be unevenly applied to other crypto-based smart contract platforms in the future.  But there’s a case to be made that crypto ought to and can stand independent of the current economic system. As The Economist wrote recently, the state’s role in markets is to guarantee property rights. Crypto is a grand experiment with conceding that turf to blockchains. Taking ownership of your keys means taking on associated risks.  Not everyone agrees.  “Cryptocurrency proves the need for regulations because it is as profitable to be unethical as any other form of capitalism. All cops are bastards, but the only bastards a civil society should tolerate are financial police,” the wonderfully chaotic blockchain builder Bryce Weiner said over Telegram.  Read more: SEC Chairman Gensler Agrees With Predecessor: ‘Every ICO Is a Security’  Willamette’s Grey suggested that crypto might be functioning according to its own set of rules now, but said that’s because it’s still a niche market. “I would probably describe it more as ‘forgetting the painful lessons of history so we can learn them the hard way all over again,’” he said.  Gensler may be preparing for the day when crypto isn’t just at the fringes, but at the very heart of capitalism.  “If the average person’s retirement prospects were linked to the state of crypto in the way it is today to the S&P 500, then it would be quite likely that a large downturn would be seen as socially unacceptable and lead to a government intervention,” Grey said.  “Pure” capitalism promises something ruthless, but sticks to its own rules. Too bad it’s never been tried.

It’s the firm’s first in-house lawyer, a company spokesman confirmed.  The New York-based Xethalis, formerly of Chapman and Cutler LLP, has long tackled crypto’s square-peg-round-hole regulatory status. He worked with the Winklevoss brothers in 2012 to submit the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to U.S. regulators (the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has still yet to approve a single bid).  Xethalis’ move in-house comes as other prominent venture fims in the crypto space steel their ranks with legal minds and ex-regulators. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has ramped up its rhetoric in recent months, with general partner and former federal prosecutor Katie Haun taking SEC Chair Gary Gensler to task as recently as this week.  For his part, Xethalis will assume the mantle of keeping compliance top of mind at Multicoin, both for the firm itself and in an advisory capacity for its many investments.  “We do want to be a strong advocate for the space and our portfolio companies,” he said.  In a blog post shared early with CoinDesk, Multicoin added:  “Crypto is entering mainstream awareness, and we are growing our team so that we can support entrepreneurs as effectively as possible, and engage broader stakeholders as one of the largest investment firms in the space.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/30/multicoin-capital-hires-general-counsel-as-talk-of-crypto-regulation-ramps-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c89ef3fab087f0932c78351487348ed1a03a51c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The hires come as Binance has faced scrutiny from regulators worldwide in recent months, including the U.S. and Japan. CEO Changpeng Zhao has acknowledged the company has more responsibility as the cryptocurrency industry grows larger and more complex.  The cryptocurrency exchange giant said Thursday it hired Tigran Gambaryan and Matthew Price, former special agents of the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Cyber Crimes Unit.  Gambaryan becomes Binance’s VP of Global Intelligence and Investigations. He reports to Binance Chief Security Officer Jimmy Su and helps lead the audit and investigations team, which looks to head off threats and financial losses and works with outside law enforcement agencies.  Price, who reports to Gambaryan, is serving as senior director of investigations. Both started in their new jobs earlier this month.  In the announcement, Zhao noted the exchange’s “investigations team now includes investigators who have worked on some of the most significant cyber investigations in history,” adding that “this level of experience will make Binance a leader in compliance, enhancing trust in Binance and the cryptocurrency ecosystem.”  Read more: Binance Names Europol Veteran to Join Audit and Investigations Team  The newcomers join recent recruits, former Europol investigator Nils Andersen-Röed and former California detective Aron Akbiyikian, who also ran investigations at Chainalysis and TRM Labs.

His cases covered such areas as national security, terrorism financing and Bank Secrecy Act violations.  At the IRS-CI, Price headed international investigations into individuals and groups looking to use cryptocurrency for illegal intent, including the successful prosecution of the operator of Helix, a darknet mixing service that sent out transactions in mixed batches to mask the identity of senders. In his 15 years in law enforcement and intelligence, he has worked on cases involving money laundering, financial crimes and counterterrorism, among other areas.

The pilot program aims to give 1,300 participating households a one-time payment of $120 that they can use to pay for low-cost internet for one year.  To fund those payments, the mayor’s Office of Technology and Innovation will install 20 Helium-compatible hotspots with volunteer residents and small businesses. The hotspots will mine HNT tokens for six months.  Helium aims to provide wireless connectivity that doesn’t rely on centralized wireless carriers. Instead, it seeks to build a global peer-to-peer network of nodeshttps://nodes.com/ that power internet-of-things (IoT) devices. The network includes more than 200,000 nodes, according to the Helium website.  Helium mining devices use 5 watts of energy to provide long-range wireless access to devices around them while earning HNT tokens. This type of connection cannot support devices like laptops or smartphones, but can work for IoT devices.

42411908,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgx0M,1633020772,How to Send Bitcoin Tips on Twitter,"Tips is an integrated tipping service on Twitter that allows users to to send bitcoin by adding links to to third-party payment services, including bitcoin wallets and Lightning Network services, on their profiles. The new tool is designed to be more seamless than sharing third-party payment usernames via tweets and involves embedding links directly into your Twitter profile.  The tipping tool was first introduced in May 2021 as an exclusive feature for selected users and was later rolled out to more users on Sept. 23, 2021. Starting in February 2022, users can add their Ethereum wallets to Twitter and send ether (ETH) as well.  How does Tips work?  As of writing, Tips is currently available to Android and iOS users only. This means web users may have to wait a while before they can start enjoying this feature.  For those interested in sending bitcoin to other users, the first thing you need to check is the recipient’s eligibility to receive tips. Users that can accept tips or have activated this feature have a Tips icon, which resembles a fiat bill, next to the Follow button on their Twitter profile. By clicking this icon, you get to see all of the payment services accepted by the user. Twitter will automatically direct you to the third-party payment service where the transactions can be executed. The supported payment services are:  Bitcoin wallet  Strike (Bitcoin Lightning Network)  Bandcamp  Cash App  Chipper  Patreon  Razorpay  Wealthsimple Cash  Venmo  GoFundMe  PicPay  Note that the availability of these services is dependent on where users are located. The only payment networks available globally are Bitcoin and the Lightning options.  Read more: What Can You Buy with Bitcoin?  How to send bitcoin on Twitter  Although there is a wide range of payment methods supported by Tips, we will be focusing more on those options enabling bitcoin (BTC) transactions. To send bitcoin-denominated tips, you can either use a bitcoin wallet or execute the transaction via Strike, which is a bitcoin Lightning Network service.  Send tips via bitcoin wallets  The bitcoin wallet payment feature is as simple as they come. Follow the steps below to send tips denominated in bitcoin to Twitter users.  Click the Tips icon on the recipient’s Twitter profile to confirm that a bitcoin wallet transfer is supported. If bitcoin payment is supported, there will be a bitcoin wallet address attached to the profile.  You can copy this address and paste it in the recipient address field on your bitcoin wallet to send bitcoin directly to the Twitter user.  Send bitcoin tips via Lightning Network  Alternatively, you can tip Twitter users with bitcoin via Light Network-enabled Strike. It is important to explain how Lightning Network and Strike work before discussing the steps involved.  What is Lightning Network? Lightning Network is a secondary payment layer built on the Bitcoin network to initiate cheap and fast transactions. Note that it takes up to an hour for a bitcoin transaction to be finalized on the Bitcoin blockchain. By using the Lightning Network, users can sidestep this time-consuming process by executing instant transactions between multiple channels on the Lightning Network before registering the final state on the blockchain.  undefined  What is Strike? Strike is an app that provides Lightning Network services to users for instant and free bitcoin transactions. Think of it as a seamless payment service like Cashapp and PayPal that uses Bitcoin’s secondary layer – instead of traditional fiat rails – to facilitate transactions across borders. Because Strike does not charge extra fees on payment executed via its Lightning Network, it is ideal for micropayments.  How to use Strike to send bitcoin on Twitter  Note that Strike is only available to people in the U.S. (excluding those living in New York and Hawaii) and El Salvador. First you have to create and fund an account on Strike or any other Lightning Network supported service before you can start using it as a channel to tip Twitter users. Once you have set up a Strike account, you can head to Twitter and continue the following steps:  Confirm that the Twitter user supports Strike by clicking on the Tips icon on the user profile to view the supported third-party payment service.  You can choose from the default amounts ranging from $1 to $10 or opt for a custom setting where you can manually insert the amount you want to send.  After selecting an amount, click on Next. You will be directed to a new page where you can add a comment, which will be delivered along with the tip notification to the recipient. Lastly, you will be directed to your Strike app, where you can confirm the transaction.  It is worth mentioning that you can send bitcoin from your Strike account to a bitcoin wallet address. However, unlike executing bitcoin transactions between two Strike accounts, sending bitcoin from a Strike account to a bitcoin wallet address incurs network fees.  How to start receiving bitcoin tips  To receive bitcoin tips, you need to first confirm your eligibility status by going to your profile page and clicking the Edit Profile button. If you find a Tips option here, you are eligible to use this feature. Below are the steps required to activate Tips:  Click on the Tips option to activate the feature. Note that you will have to agree to Twitter’s General Tipping Policy before you can continue the process.  Once you have agreed to the rule governing this service, you will be directed to a settings screen. Here, you have to toggle the Allow tips button on and choose from any of the bitcoin-enabled options listed among the supported third-party services.  If Strike is your preferred option, you need to add your Strike username to complete the process. Alternatively, you can add a bitcoin wallet address. After successfully adding a Strike username or bitcoin wallet address, a Tips icon will automatically appear on your profile.  Why is this feature important?  1. It exemplifies Twitter’s commitment to its emerging content economy  For a while now, Twitter has been introducing new features designed to promote more conversations and improve user experience. Having built a strong following and user base, the next step is to induce more engagements and entice content creators to spend more time on the platform. It is safe to say that the introduction of Tips showcases Twitter’s intent to enable a content economy designed around a tipping system. With this, users can tip their favorite content creators, appreciate a gesture or even support businesses. Additionally, Tips can also be used to contribute financially to an important cause.  2. Tips introduces bitcoin to Twitter’s ecosystem  More importantly, the introduction of Tips marks the first bitcoin implementation on Twitter. Jack Dorsey had previously hinted that it was only a matter of time before Twitter began to adopt bitcoin in one capacity or the other. The decision to incorporate Bitcoin and the Lightning Network as part of the supported payment methods on Tips shows that bitcoin can play a pivotal role in the ongoing push for content monetization.

The incentives will be applied “across the entire platform” but will focus in particular on “growth in native markets,” per a copy of the release provided to CoinDesk. The incentives will consist of $10 million in JOE tokens and $10 million in AVAX.  The $20 million in incentives is especially large given the current size of the project – accounting for 7% of the JOE token’s total market cap at the time of writing.  The incentives are part of Avalanche Rush, a mammoth $180 million ecosystem-wide incentive program announced in August.  “We’re really humbled to be able to participate in Avalanche Rush in a big way, putting us as the recipients of the second-largest grant – only Aave’s has been larger,” said pseudonymous Trader Joe co-founder 0xMurloc.  Read more: Can Avalanche Keep It Up? DeFi Users Rush In as Incentives Roll Out  The exchange now counts $1.2 billion in the closely watched total value locked (TVL) metric, up from just $25 million at the start of August.  It has also managed to overtake rival exchange Pangolin in TVL and volume, accounting for 85% of swaps on Avalanche and capturing 90% of liquidity coming across the bridge, per Murloc.  “We want to be the largest exchange across all EVM [Ethereum Virtual Machine] chains,” Murloc said, adding that the team wants to expand to be a full-service DeFi platform offering lending and other services.  Its “Banker Joe” money market is expected to launch later this year.  Unlike many projects, however, Trader Joe won’t be going cross-chain any time soon, and Murloc says that sticking to Avalanche is part of a strategy to “stick with what works.”  Murloc said that part of the team’s faith in Avalanche comes from how quickly the ecosystem is developing.  “With all blockchains, at some point, you need the ecosystem to grow on its own and mature, and I think we’re getting to that stage in the lifecycle. We’re starting to have more projects being launched – it’s now impossible to keep up with it. It used to be a handful of developers in one single chat room, and now there’s a bunch of people showing up that no one’s heard of before – and that’s exciting,” Murloc said.

Paxos completed a $300 million funding round in April and also has deals with PayPal and Interactive Brokers.  Ben Cruikshank, head of Flourish, said the move is a result of rapidly growing demand by institutional investors and their clients for exposure to digital assets.  “We’ve heard from countless advisors that they are fielding questions about crypto on a daily basis – and that they don’t have the right solutions to meet this growing client demand or to compete with offerings from retail trading platforms and wirehouses,” Cruikshank said in a statement.  MassMutual, a giant of the insurance industry, acquired Flourish in February following a $100 million investment in bitcoin and the purchase of a $5 million equity stake in NYDIG in December 2020.

While issuers aren’t required to apply for an AMF visa, having one allows them to open bank accounts and solicit investments, according to law firm Baker McKenzie.  The AMF said it suspected that some of the documents submitted by Air Next were forgeries, and has not issued a visa for this ICO or any other token offering by the company.  Investors are advised to remain vigilant in the event of being approached by Air Next and to avoid referring such approaches to third parties, it said.  Air Next says it offers a blockchain-based service allowing users to buy plane or train tickets with an instant refund in the event of delay or cancellation.

Bitcoin has gained 4.5% to trade near $43,400 one day after exhibiting bearish price action. The cryptocurrency failed to keep gains above $42,000 on Wednesday, hinting at further weakness, as pseudonymous trader @trader1sz noted on Twitter.  However, the cryptocurrency picked up early today, possibly in response to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler reiterating support for a narrow class of bitcoin ETFs that would invest in futures contracts instead of buying the cryptocurrency directly. “There is some newfound optimism around the launch and approval of an ETF in the U.S,” said Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds.  Canada’s decision to approve a multi-cryptocurrency ETF that holds bitcoin and ether may have added more impetus to the advance. The U.S. SEC’s final verdict on several bitcoin ETF applications and a first response on futures-based ETFs is due next quarter.  The consensus in the crypto market is that an ETF would become the most important source of demand from yield-hungry institutional and traditional market investors. The first gold-backed ETF in the U.S., the SPDR Gold Trust, was launched on Nov. 18, 2004. Since then, the metal’s price has developed a strong link with the SPDR trust flows.  Data from ByteTree Asset Management show bitcoin ETFs and funds now own around 801,000 BTC, amounting to 4.3% of the total supply. “Holdings ballooned from 250,000 in 2019 to 800,000 today and helped drive the bitcoin bull market from $5,000 to $64,0000, before flattening off,” ByteTree Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Charlie Morris said in the latest ByteTree Market Health Update published Wednesday. ByteTree tracks the European and Canadian ETFs with the US and Canadian closed-ended funds.  The funds have amassed just over 3,000 bitcoin over the past four weeks. Blockchain data show large traders have accumulated coins during the recent price dip in a sign of confidence in bitcoin’s broader bull run.  Stack Funds’ Dibb said, “We are experiencing some end-of-month buying before the quarter is closed. We may see this continue over the next few days as funds take on new investor subscriptions.”  The bullish sentiment is also evident from thick bids stacked ay around $40,000 on crypto exchange Bitfinex, as analyst Cole Garner tweeted.  However, prospects of tighter Federal Reserve policy, the U.S. debt uncertainty, and the dollar rally could cap gains.  The 60-day rolling correlation between the greenback and bitcoin has dropped to -0.33, the strongest negative reading since March, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

42421729,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpGVZ,1633014387,3 Factors That Make Quant Trading in Crypto Unique,"In recent years, quantitative (quant) trading has gone from mysticism to being part of the everyday vocabulary of capital markets. The rapid proliferation of algorithmic trading together with trends such as machine learning has some experts thinking that every trading fund will eventually become a quant fund. Crypto was born in this golden era of quant financing and its digital and programmable nature makes it an ideal asset class for quant strategies. However, quant trading in crypto is both incredibly challenging and different from other asset trading.  Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock, a market intelligence platform for crypto assets. He has held leadership roles at major technology companies and hedge funds. He is an active investor, speaker, author and guest lecturer at Columbia University in New York.  There are a number of relatively simple factors that make quant strategies for crypto assets unique. To put those factors in perspective, we can start by understanding the history of quant trading since its inception.  A brief history of quant finance  The roots of quantitative finance/trading can be traced back to mathematicians such as Louis Bachelier and his seminal work, “Theory of Speculation,” which outlined a model to price options under normal distributions. Bachelier’s ideas were mostly forgotten for over a century before being rediscovered by economists including Paul Samuelson and Robert Merton in their work in options pricing.  In the first half of the 20th century, most of the work around quant finance still lacked practical applications. This started to change in the 1950s when Harry Markowitz relied on computational finance methods to solve portfolio optimization problems, opening the doors to algorithmic trading across large numbers of securities. A remarkable figure in the history of quant finance has been the famous mathematician and hedge fund manager Edward Thorp, who adapted a lot of his work predicting and simulating blackjack card games to exploit pricing anomalies in securities markets. Very similar ideas to Thorp’s were formalized by economists Fischer Black and Myron Scholes when developing the Black–Scholes model, which was awarded the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics. These ideas are still at the center of modern quant strategies, including those in crypto.  Read more: When DeFi Becomes Intelligent | Jesus Rodriguez  Despite its roots in academic research, the history of quant trading is tightly linked to technological developments in capital markets. From the transition from floor trading to electronic markets, the emergence of dark pools or the renaissance of movements such as machine learning, most pivotal moments have been enabled by technological breakthroughs.  The early 2000s became the golden era of quant trading, with billions of dollars flowing from traditional discretionary funds to quant alternatives. This is the universe into which crypto was born. Crypto represents not only a new asset class but a technological breakthrough in financial markets and, as a result, presented a new landscape for quant trading.  What makes quant for crypto different?  Despite the diversity in financial markets, the mechanics of quant strategies remain relatively similar across asset classes. It turns out that quant strategies that trade oil futures or traditional equities are incredibly similar in terms of datasets, techniques and infrastructure. Even more interesting, the technological evolutions in financial markets have benefited all asset classes fairly evenly. For instance, when dark pools were established, they were used by high frequency trading (HFT) funds to trade all sorts of financial instruments. From that perspective, quant trading technology has evolved at a very similar pace across all asset classes.  Crypto is the first asset class that combines new financial instruments with incremental technology improvements such as programmability or decentralization. There are several factors that make quant strategies in crypto unique, but most of them can be grouped into three fundamental categories: New Sources of Alpha, Programmable Financial Primitives and Unconventional Risk Models.  Alpha  The datasets used by quantitative strategies to discover alpha (the excess return of an investment relative to the return of a benchmark index) in different asset classes such as commodities, equities or currencies are remarkably similar. Spot or derivative order books, earnings reports and central bank reports are some of the common sources of alpha used in quant models in traditional capital markets. Crypto is the first asset class to introduce a new native source of alpha in the form of blockchain datasets.  Blockchain records are an incredibly rich source to extract intelligence related to the behavior of relevant parties in the crypto ecosystem such as exchanges, miners, large holders (whales), long-term holders and many others. From manual labeling to machine learning classification models, there are several strategies that help identify the entities associated with blockchain addresses. That information can enable strategies that detect trading signals based on the flow of capital in and out of the relevant addresses such as an exchange’s hot wallets that are accessible online. From that perspective, blockchain represents a new source of alpha that can spark new types of quant strategies specifically tailored to crypto assets.  Primitives  Quant strategies in traditional financial instruments focus on making predictions about the state of the market and executing actions based on those predictions. However, the infrastructure processing those actions relies on financial functions such as market making, lending or insurance that are controlled by obscure intermediaries outside the quant models themselves.  In crypto, decentralized finance (DeFi) introduces the idea of disintermediating those traditional financial primitives with smart contracts whose functionality is not only transparent but can be programmatically accessed by quant strategies. This simple idea adds a completely new vector to quant models in crypto, and DeFi specifically.  Read more: 6 Reasons DeFi Will Stay Inefficient (and Profitable) | Jesus Rodriguez  In addition to modeling predictions and executing trades, DeFi quant models interacting can interact with an underlying layer of financial primitives such as lending, staking, market making and many others. Also, the behavior of these financial primitives produces a footprint of on-chain data that can be incorporated as a unique source of intelligence in quant models. Replacing obscure intermediaries with transparent and programmable smart contracts introduces levels of automation and intelligence in DeFi quant strategies that have no equivalent in traditional capital markets.  Risk models  Almost since its inception, risk management is an essential component of quant strategies. Traditional risk management models in quant strategies evolve around price-related concepts such as volatility or hedging.  Crypto is a natively digital and programmable asset class, and that nature introduces different risk vectors that are foreign to traditional quant strategies. Events such as forks (a change in open-source software that requires users to upgrade to ensure everyone is running the same version of the code), liquidity attacks, smart contract hacks or new protocol launches, exchange listings represent relevant risk dimensions in crypto assets that should be factored in quant strategies. Although crypto still lacks a formal risk management theory that encompasses these new elements, most quant models express some individual awareness of them. As quant strategies in crypto evolve, so will their corresponding risk management models.  Perfect storm  The emergence of crypto coincided with a series of market and technological movements that makes it the perfect asset class for quant strategies. For starters, crypto was born in the golden era of quant trading in which quant asset managers are receiving a disproportional level of attention compared to discretionary alternatives.  Additionally, crypto coincided with the first mainstream wave of adoption in machine learning and deep learning technologies, which are driving a disproportional level of innovation in quant trading models.  Finally, the digital and programmable nature of crypto enables the emergence of new financial instruments such as DeFi, which represent a new playground for quant strategies.  Despite the confluence of positive factors, building quant strategies in crypto is different than in traditional capital markets. Unexplored sources of alpha, a new generation of financial primitives and unconventional risk models are some of the factors pushing the boundaries of quant trading in crypto.  Crypto might not have been designed for quant strategies but it could end up being the asset class that catalyzes a new wave of innovation in the quant space.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/30/3-factors-that-make-quant-trading-in-crypto-unique,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b00380f254ab7e5222f7960ffc24e58554c4a590-2896x1944.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410983,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtuKt,1633007766,Coincidence or Insider Trading? Price Pops Before Incentive Announcements Raise Questions,"“Buy the rumor, sell the news.” It is not surprising when a token sees a price pop after its underlying blockchain announces a multimillion-dollar program to attract new users.  But in the case for some popular tokens of layer 1 blockchains, the price pumps were premature: Trading data shows that both volume and prices for some tokens started going up a few days before incentives were announced, raising questions on whether some insiders were front-running the news.  Team members from these projects denied the possibility of insider trading, but for an industry that tries to eradicate financial inequality, the pre-event price pump can shake some investors’ faith in crypto.  “Digital assets operate like a frontier economy where rules and regulations are still being developed,” Jesse Proudman, CEO and co-founder of crypto robo-advisor Makara, said. “Insider trading, long established as illegal in established markets, is often celebrated in these markets.”  Days before blockchains Celo, Avalanche and Algorand announced major incentive programs, trading volumes across all centralized exchanges for their respective tokens were rising steadily, as were their prices, according to data compiled by the crypto analysts at Kaiko.  For example, before Algorand announced its $300 million decentralized finance (DeFi) fund on Sept. 10, the price of its token ALGO had been climbing for a few days – this positive growth in pricing was also little affected by a broader market sell-off at the time.  Similar moves happened to Celo and Avalanche as well.  “The charts for those cryptos mentioned certainly suggest significant buying immediately prior to public announcements,” Rick Delaney, senior analyst at OKEx Insights, said. “The most logical conclusion is that those closest to the deals or partnerships front-ran the announcements.”  Representatives from Celo and Algorand declined to comment on token prices, but said various news events leading up to their incentive announcements had generated increased excitement and confidence among token holders.  “Celo has no insight into who is trading and for what reasons,” a representative for Celo wrote in an email. “A number of major announcements led up to that point,” the person said, including a tweet by data site Defi Llama that it started tracking a decentralized exchange on Celo.  Algorand representatives sounded a similar note.  “While we don’t generally speculate on the reason for price movements of the ALGO token, we want to point out that the launch of the Viridis DeFi fund was one of a number of significant events that occurred in a very dynamic late August and early September for the Algorand ecosystem,” Stephen Duignan, head of marketing at the Algorand Foundation, said through a representative.  By press time, Ava Labs, the company that builds Avalanche, did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.  Inside the data  According to some sources who spoke to CoinDesk on the subject, it is still possible that insider trading was involved in the pre-event price pump.  All three blockchains, Celo, Avalanche and Algorand, have their own blockchain explorers that, in theory, allow anyone to search for any on-chain transactions. Thanks to that, blockchain analysis firm Crystal Blockchain found that at least on Celo and Avalanche, the on-chain transactions spiked just a day before their official announcements.  On Celo, for example, the total number of transactions spiked on Aug. 24, one day before Celo’s announcement, which was similar to the number of transactions on Aug. 25, according to Scott Pounder, head of investigations at Crystal. The firm was not able to analyze Algorand’s data because its blockchain explorer does not provide filters to sort data by time frames.  “These organizations try to keep price-affecting news confidential before release, but as with all organizations, it’s possible that insiders do trade confidential information or it’s leaked to other people that do,” Andrew Kang, co-founder of crypto investment firm Mechanism Capital, told CoinDesk.  Big picture  Crypto has a total market capitalization of about $2 trillion (versus $11 trillion for gold); therefore, the value of most cryptocurrencies is small enough that their prices can be more vulnerable to potential price manipulation.  “When seeking to invest in digital assets, people should always do their homework and understand the risks involved, as they can be far more volatile than traditional assets,” Makara’s Proudman said.  According to Chen Arad, chief operating officer at crypto risk monitoring firm Solidus Labs, the lack of market surveillance solutions has invited “common manipulative schemes like pump and dump, insider trading, wash-trading.” He estimated that at least 85% crypto platforms have not deployed any market surveillance tools.  On the other hand  But some argue that with all the excitement around layer 1 blockchains, it is also possible the pre-event price pumps occurred because investors are betting on the next hot layer 1 after witnessing the huge success of Solana and Terra (and Bitcoin and Ethereum before them).  “It looks like in the last few weeks there’s been a sort of rotation in every top layer 1 or even secondary layer 1 with some significant price move at some point,” Jake Dwyer, managing director and head of DeFi at crypto market maker GSR, said. “If you look over the last month and a half, you just see really aggressive price action on each of them.”  Avi Felman, co-portfolio manager at crypto investment firm BlockTower Capital, said Avalanche was among the first projects to deploy the incentive playbook, which was followed by many other competitors.  “And once [Avalanche] started the program, I think a lot of people realized that coins with big treasuries could also pull the same stunt, so piled in,” Felman said of the $180 million “Avalanche Rush” program. A pioneer in the approach is Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which announced a $100 million fund for DeFi projects on BSC back in September 2020.  According to Messari’s second-quarter report on layer 1 projects in July, the effect of Ethereum’s rising transaction fees has forced many developers and traders to look for cheaper and faster alternatives. While many base layers claim to provide faster and cheaper transactions, the prospect of juiced token returns has become one of the more efficient ways to attract Ethereum users.  “There is a lot of money from traders trying to find the next narrative or big layer 1 play,” said Mechanism’s Kang.",NEGATIVE,ALGO,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/30/coincidence-or-insider-trading-price-pops-before-incentive-announcements-raise-questions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d53d13a0bd5e9a63cc52cb9e00eba0a3740e3520-5125x3410.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424545,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2qA1h,1633006870,Gelato Raises $11M as Smart Contract Automation Market Heats Up,"The race is on to see who can capture the smart contract automation market, and early pioneer Gelato has raised $11 million to expand operations.  The Series A round was led by Dragonfly Ventures, with participation from ParaFi Capital, Nascent, IDEO CoLab Ventures and Aave founder Stani Kulechov.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Gelato co-founder Hilmar Orth said the round’s backers will vest their tokens for two years and will be key in introducing the team to prospective clients.  The raise comes at a time where teams are just beginning to scratch the surface of smart contract automation – a key piece of blockchain plumbing that has the potential to be a massive market, and what Orth describes as the Google Cloud of Web 3.  “Many more transactions will be automated within these networks than data being fed in from the outside,” Orth told CoinDesk. “So from the volume of transactions, this is a much, much wider market than oracles.”  Infrastructure play  In explaining what Gelato does, Orth pointed to Cloud and Amazon Lambda – two services that enabled companies to perform computation without hardware overhead.  “You’ve got these services that millions of applications are running on today where you write small functions to do certain tasks – I want to send an email or create a listing on Airbnb or something, and they just run these scripts in small containers,” he said.  In Web 3, users need similar functionality from “bots” – tools that automate certain smart contract functions. Gelato client InstaDapp, for instance, has a decentralized finance (DeFi) aggregator that enables debt refinancing – switching among MakerDAO, Aave and Compound to ensure the lowest possible rates and collateral requirements.  However, until Gelato, users had to manually switch their positions.  “What Gelato offers, rather than you building every bot from scratch for every single specific use case out there in Web 3, and there are millions, we just built a general-purpose protocol and and network that you can plug into and you can automate any function you want without having to build this infrastructure,” Orth told CoinDesk.  Another example is limit orders on automated market makers (AMM) – a common tool in traditional finance that executes a trade only at a present price that has largely eluded decentralized exchanges for some time. Polygon-native QuickSwap and Fantom-native SpookySwap use Gelato functions to enable them, executing 500-600 orders every day accounting for millions of dollars in volume, said Orth.  In all, a large and growing number of projects need these automated processes to offer different services to users.  “They’re all small use cases, but they really add up,” Orth said.  Competitive landscape  Gelato isn’t the only team looking to corner the market, however.  “It’s crystal clear there will be competition sooner rather than later,” Orth said.  Despite being crunchier, back-end tooling, the automation market features cutthroat competition. After working with Chainlink in 2019 – winning second place at a Chainlink-sponsored ETH Berlin hackathon and holding ongoing talks after – Chainlink released a rival “Keepers” product in August, according to Orth.  Read more: Chainlink Unveils Crypto ‘Keepers’ and Anti-Fraud Blockchain Bridges  Likewise, the team was approached by Andre Cronje in early 2020 to help automate functions for Yearn, but he released his Keep3r competitor later in the year.  “He released Keep3r with a token and suddenly everyone was hyping this, and we’re like, ‘Damn, maybe we also need a token,’” joked Orth.  The team held a sale for GEL, Gelato’s native token, in August.  Additionally, in August Cronje accused the Chainlink team of “copying” Keep3r architecture, saying that he would be using rival Band oracles for future projects:  In a statement to CoinDesk, Cronje somewhat reversed that stance, saying that Gelato, Keep3r and Keepers are “not competitors” and all fill “different niches.” Cronje also was a donator to early Gelato Gitcoin grant rounds.  While Orth griped about the exclusivity deals Chainlink signs with users, he ultimately concluded that competition is good.  “The market for arbitrary smart contract execution is much larger than the oracle market, probably, so it’s a natural move for Chainlink to try to move into this space,” he said. “At the end of the day the better product should win, and they will also add to the growth of the network and the growth of the ecosystem, so it’s fair play.”  In a statement to CoinDesk, a Chainlink representative declined to weigh in directly on the competitive dynamics, writing, “Chainlink Keepers has the largest number of users across DeFi, gaming and other smart contracts” and that the team has been working on the product for “over three years.”  Orth also hinted that there may be a collaboration in the works between Keep3r and Gelato.  “Andre’s a competitor, but at the end of the day he’s a builder – he doesn’t think about competition, he wants us to work together in some way to team up against,” he paused for a moment, “other projects in the space.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LINK | MARKET | MKR,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/30/gelato-raises-11m-as-smart-contract-automation-market-heats-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b9b3cba7ec6523221edbfa742b2720ae6b6e516-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421726,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpGXd,1633006200,The Importance of Bitcoin Upgrades and Layer Two Applications,"It’s no secret that the crypto community is divided around the support of bitcoin and alt coins, a term given to any coin that is an alternative to bitcoin. Some are in the camp that bitcoin, along with future technical improvements, will be the main – if not the only – coin that will survive. While others view this as impossible, it’s important to understand why these pro-bitcoin believers remain so convinced.  Crucial to the advancement of bitcoin are the Bitcoin Core Developers. This is an international team of developers, often called “maintainers,” that is constantly monitoring, improving and working on bitcoin and its blockchain. This group, due to its decentralized nature, is funded by companies, such as Square, Coinbase, Gemini and others, and the community to maintain Bitcoin’s open-source and secure network.  Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)  Often, these core developers will propose changes to the Bitcoin network. These changes are referred to as Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and, if implemented, create a formal change to Bitcoin. True to Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, anyone can propose a BIP. The community will discuss each BIP until it is ultimately accepted or rejected.  Upon acceptance, each BIP is assigned a number and officially published on the Bitcoin Core GitHub. When this happens, the Bitcoin Core Developers really get to work. They test the upgrade and make sure it is safe to implement on Bitcoin. Once satisfactory due diligence is done on the BIP (often this is referred to as reaching consensus), the activation plan is created. Upon the network approving the BIP and the activation plan, the code is changed and the upgrade is implemented.  SegWit and Taproot  A notable BIP on Bitcoin was SegWit (BIP 141), which was activated in 2017. This upgrade modified the Bitcoin code and effectively increased the block size by removing signature data from Bitcoin transactions. In short, the BIP 141 upgrade allowed more transactions to be included in each Bitcoin block and therefore increased the Bitcoin transaction volume.  This November, Bitcoin will undergo the biggest upgrade to its code since SegWit. Taproot (discussed in BIP 340, 341 and 342) introduces what are called Schnorr signatures to Bitcoin. To avoid a very technical discussion, Taproot will improve privacy, scalability and finally implement smart contract functions on Bitcoin.  One of the major benefits of Taproot activation is the fact that multi-signature transactions will become much less data heavy, which blazes a Bitcoin path for smart contract implementation. Many alt coins were designed from the ground up with these improvements in place and therefore drew attention and investment away from Bitcoin. The Bitcoin developers took plenty of time to ensure this upgrade was safe before implementation. Many, including myself, view this as a monumental move for Bitcoin, and it certainly levels the playing field in the smart-contract competition.  As a financial advisor with clients interested in bitcoin, it’s important to understand these upgrades and their potential impact on the investment thesis of bitcoin. BIPs can have positive effects or negative effects when implemented on Bitcoin. Just as an advisor would listen to quarterly calls of companies whose stocks they hold for clients in order to determine future outlooks, the same applies to Bitcoin, and an advisor must remain aware of any future changes.  Layer two applications  Another component of Bitcoin is what is called layer two applications. Very early in the history of Bitcoin, the community noticed scaling problems. If bitcoin were to ever become a global currency, or even compete with companies like Western Union, Visa or others, developers would need to create solutions that allow for cheap and fast transactions to always occur. The Bitcoin blocks would become too crowded, transaction times would be too long, and fees too high if a solution wasn’t presented and implemented. The Bitcoin mainchain can handle approximately three to seven transactions per second, a far cry from the 20,000 transactions per second that occur on credit card networks.  Bitcoin Lightning Network  Along came the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a second layer protocol that operates on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Lightning takes transactions “off-chain.” Basically, bitcoin is removed from the main network and placed into a two-party, multi-signature “channel.” This channel is created between two parties and allows each party to send nearly an unlimited amount of transactions at a very low cost. These transactions happen specifically on the Lightning Network and not on the Bitcoin blockchain. Because these transactions are not approved by Bitcoin nodes or miners, the Bitcoin network is not affected. Upon terminating or closing the Lightning channel, all of the information included in the history of the channel is consolidated and included in a transaction that is then sent to the main Bitcoin blockchain (mainnet) to be recorded.  Twitter recently announced tipping for all iOS users. For this to be possible, Twitter will rely on third-party companies such as Strike that provide the ability to link a Twitter account to a Bitcoin address and a Lightning Network address. The Lightning Network allows tiny amounts of money to be sent instantly to anyone with an address. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has been a longtime proponent of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Many view this as an elegant solution to many problems faced in the global payment’s ecosystem. Many pro-Bitcoin investors are encouraged to see that such a large social media company is exclusively building on Bitcoin, and this adds to their Bitcoin-only conviction.  What is clear is that Bitcoin Core developers are focused exclusively on improving Bitcoin. Through BIP implementations, layer 2 advancements, and the continued focus on Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency is constantly able to compete with newer projects and continues to demand the majority of market share in the cryptosphere. Taproot and Lightning Network will allow bitcoin to remain competitive with other alt coins in terms of functionality, speed and security. Not only is bitcoin the largest cryptocurrency based on market cap, but the upgrades and core developers are working to ensure that bitcoin remains preeminent.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/30/the-importance-of-bitcoin-upgrades-and-layer-two-applications,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa63d111448961a4364deb5e109d776faa161c10-4077x3203.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424543,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2q9xh,1633000486,"Terra Blockchain, Home of LUNA and UST, Upgrades for Cross-Chain Interoperability","The Terra blockchain has completed Columbus-5, a hotly anticipated upgrade that is expected to make the system work more seamlessly with other cryptocurrency networks.  The upgrade began at 8:31 UTC Thursday, after the publication of block No. 4,724,000, and was finished roughly 2 1/2 hours later, when the development team declared the revamped chain stable and ready to use. During the migration, users were advised to refrain from sending transactions on the network or accessing their wallets, since the new version of the software is not compatible with its predecessor.  Columbus-5 “will enable dozens of applications to launch,” wrote Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at Messari, in the data provider’s newsletter this week.  Perhaps more importantly, it promises to let investors easily transfer assets from Terra to a host of other chains and vice versa. LUNA, the native asset of the Terra blockchain, has surged in value in 2021 and is currently the 12th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.  The easy transfer of assets across networks stems from Terra now being able to use the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) standard, which eases the exchange of data among all the networks that adopt it.  To be clear: IBC adoption is “subject to an on-chain governance vote on Terra before manually being executed on the network – meaning it won’t be functional until activated by community vote,” Brian Curran of the Terra team told CoinDesk. “Governance votes on Terra have a 14-day voting period, so IBC will go live on Terra sometime shortly after the voting period, assuming that it passes.”  At least 10 other blockchains have integrated IBC, the most famous of them being Cosmos, which was built with interoperability in mind. Around 13 or so other networks are working on it, according to an upgrade-tracking website whimsically titled “Wen Mainnet, Sir?”  Building bridges  Terra’s compatibility with other systems is set to further improve in the coming weeks, when yet another “bridge” protocol, Wormhole V2, is fully connected to the chain.  Wormhole will aid the movement of Terra tokens to and from two massively popular blockchains, Ethereum and Solana, according to an Aug. 9 blog post by Curran. These networks’ native tokens, ETH and SOL, rank No. 2 and No. 7 among all cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to CoinGecko data.  “Cross-chain movements of UST and other Terra assets to ETH are currently available via our Shuttle bridge,” Curran told CoinDesk. “However, Shuttle will soon be deprecated for Wormhole, which allows more decentralized cross-chain transfers of UST and other Terra assets to both Solana and ETH.”  Technically, “Wormhole V2 is already live for Solana, ETH and Terra,” Curran explained. Wormhole’s node operators, known as guardians, “support Terra for V2, but the front-end interface support that allows users to transfer assets in and out of Terra to Solana and Ethereum is not live yet. The Wormhole team is just awaiting the launch of Col-5 before launching V2 UI support for Terra, which should happen within a week after Col-5 goes live.”  Taken together, these enhancements have big implications for TerraUSD (UST), a stablecoin designed to hold its value against the U.S. dollar that runs on Terra.  “The upgrade could potentially accelerate ... UST’s growth, gaining its market share in the decentralized stablecoin market as UST will be able to move cross-chain,” Kevin Kang, managing principal at BKCoin Capital, a digital assets hedge fund, told CoinDesk.  Read more: The Quest for a Truly Decentralized Stablecoin  Messari’s Watkins was even bolder, suggesting that UST, currently the fifth-largest stablecoin with a $2.6 billion market cap, could overtake DAI, No. 4 among stablecoins overall with twice as much in circulation. That is a stated goal of Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, which developed UST and Terra.  “The combination of these upgrades and integrations have the potential to accelerate UST supply growth substantially setting up UST to flip DAI,” Watkins wrote.  Interoperability also means products built on Terra, such as the Anchor lending system and Mirror protocol for tokenizing stocks like Tesla and Apple, can now accept coins from other chains as collateral, noted Fred Schebesta, founder of the price-comparison site Finder and an avid crypto investor.  “The ability to adapt both Inter Blockchain Communication and Wormhole v.2 makes Terra a beast to be reckoned with,” he said.

This couldn&apos;t happen without the initial 7-person team finding a way to spearhead crypto adoption in 2013. Little did they know, KuCoin would become a global enterprise with over 600 employees and serve 8 million users in 207 countries. KuCoin started solely as a spot-crypto trading platform. It&apos;s now morphed into a massively rich crypto ecosystem due to onboarding industry-standard services such as KuCoin Spotlight, KuCoin Futures, KuCoin Trading Bots, KuCoin Pool, KuCoin Labs, and more. This progress has led to $500 billion accumulated in trading volume and over 800 million transactions. How it all started KuCoin founder, Michael Gan was a tech expert for Alibaba Group&apos;s Ant Financial. He first heard about Bitcoin when it was only $6 from his boss (and now co-founder), Eric Tang. Michael did what most people do when they recognize Bitcoin&apos;s future potential - mine. After stacking BTCs, Michael decided to sell some on Mt.Gox as it had the most liquidity. He immediately noticed how challenging the platform was for newcomers and how it would be a problem for mass adoption.

42424548,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2qA3h,1632977310,New Zealand’s Reserve Bank Seeks Public Input on Digital Dollar Before December Deadline,"The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is seeking public input over how it should assess the way the country’s digital dollar can be used.  Two discussion papers titled “The Future of Money – Stewardship” and “The Future of Money – Central Bank Digital Currency,” released Thursday, are aiming to solicit public feedback before a Dec. 6 deadline. The bank announced it would begin discussions with the public earlier this year.  “Trends in cash use and availability along with digital innovation create opportunities to innovate,” RBNZ Assistant Governor Christian Hawkesby said in a press release Thursday. “We believe these should be discussed widely and our consultations aim to encourage that.”  The bank said in its papers that it sees trends in the use of cash and innovation in money which “present an opportunity” for the bank to consider broadening central bank money to include a widely available digital form. Central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are often touted as a means to increase financial inclusion while enhancing security. Several countries in the Caribbean have already begun using CBDCs to facilitate payments, increase liquidity and boost financial inclusion.  The RBNZ also took aim at stablecoins by treading the well-worn narrative that pegged cryptos to government currencies or commodities pose a risk to its sovereignty and domestic economy.  China is the world’s largest economy developing a CBDC, with plans to implement and experiment with foreign visitors during the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February.  Though CBDCs are not without their own inherent risks which, some argue, provide central banks with increased control over citizens’ financial rights while negatively impacting competition.  Still, the reserve bank argues a CBDC ensures a stable “anchor” of value and provides confidence that is convertible with the country’s existing money while ensuring a “fair and equal way to pay” in a “modern and inclusive economy.”  “A central bank digital currency would see the features and benefits of cash enjoyed in the digital world, working alongside cash and private money held in commercial bank accounts,” said Hawkesby.  The assistant governor said the RBNZ will release a third paper in November exploring “high-level options to achieve greater efficiency and resilience.”  Read more: Compliant Stablecoin Launches in New Zealand",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | SPONSORED,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/30/new-zealands-reserve-bank-seeks-public-input-on-digital-dollar-before-december-deadline,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3eac9a4924b23ff4e9bf9a41a99d949e53afd73-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424579,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2q9fh,1632969042,"SBI, Sygnum, Azimut Establish $75M VC Fund for Crypto Startup Investments","A new Singapore-based venture capital fund has been set up by three major financial services firms that will pour $75 million into crypto startups across the European Union and Asia.  Japan’s SBI Group, Switzerland’s Sygnum Bank and Italy’s Azimut Group have incorporated the fund as a Variable Capital Company in a bid to “accelerate the growth of promising companies” within the industry.  SBI’s Ven Capital will act as the fund’s primary fund manager, while the fund’s investment strategy will mainly focus on pre-Series A and Series A companies developing blockchain, according to a press release on Wednesday.  Companies involved in distributed ledger technology (DLT) infrastructure, decentralized finance, and regulatory technology tools will also be the target of the fund’s investment.  The fund seeks a piece of the crypto industry’s venture capital inflows, which amounts to roughly 6% of all global venture capital funding year-to-date and is up slightly over 1% on the same time last year, per the release.  “DLT and digital assets are at the inflection point of mainstream adoption,” said SBI Ven Capital CEO Ryosuke Hayashi. “They have the potential to reduce inefficiencies and unlock new capabilities across several sectors, such as financial services and supply chain management.”  SBI Group, via its affiliate company SBI Digital Asset Holdings, has continued to ratchet investment in the industry. This began in earnest this year when SBI founder and CEO Yoshitaka Kitao said his firm would “definitely” turn a crypto joint venture into a major earner for SBI. SBI has continued to ink deals with exchanges and banks seeking to tap into the lucrative global crypto markets.  In February, Sygnum secured a significant “eight-figure” U.S. dollar investment from SBI Digital Asset Holdings, which was used to grow the firm, its client base, and expand into new markets across Europe and Asia.  Sygnum is a digital asset finance firm with a Swiss banking license. Its connection to Azimut in crypto extends back to November of last year when the Italian fund manager began experimenting with Sygnum’s blockchain-based alternative to listing shares on a stock exchange.

42424552,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2qABh,1632962166,DeFi Money Market Compound Overpays Millions in COMP Rewards in Possible Exploit; Founder Says $80M at Risk,"In a possible exploit on Wednesday night, decentralized money market Compound has been erroneously paying out millions of dollars in COMP tokens intended as liquidity mining rewards.  Twitter user “napgener” first flagged the issue, pointing to three Ethereum transactions showing users receiving a total of $15 million in COMP tokens in exchange for borrowing and supplying tiny quantities of tokens, including USDC, ETH and DAI.  Compound has a liquidity mining program that rewards depositors and borrowers, but often at a rate of a single-digit APY. The botched payout sums indicate a flaw in the comptroller contract, which disburses the COMP liquidity mining rewards, possibly related to a recent upgrade.  Observers have noted that Compound’s comptroller contract is not managed by a multi-sig controlled by Compound Labs, and any fix to the exploit may require a governance vote among COMP holders.  Per DeFi Llama, Compound is the world’s fifth-largest decentralized finance protocol with a total value locked (TVL) of $10.2 billion.  Compound acknowledged the exploit on its official Twitter handle and said no user funds are at risk:  Likewise, Compound founder Robert Leshner acknowledged the exploit in a tweet, saying that “at worst” only 280,000 COMP tokens are at risk of being erroneously claimed.  He also noted that “there are no admin controls or community tools to disable the COMP distribution; any changes to the protocol require a 7-day governance process to make their way into production. Labs, and members of the community, are evaluating potential steps to patch the COMP distribution.”  Shortly after Leshner’s tweet, at 1:38 UTC on Thursday (9:38 p.m. ET on Wednesday), some 91,000 COMP tokens worth $27 million were claimed in a single transaction. The user appears to have supplied $0 in crypto assets to the platform; they paid $154.77 in gas fees to take in their dubious haul.  The same wallet then swapped $140,000 in COMP for USDC via Uniswap.  The price of COMP has plunged on the news, falling from a 24-hour high of $334 to as low as $290. At the time of this story’s latest update, it sits at $290, according to CoinGecko.  A request for comment sent to Compound Labs was not returned by press time.  This is a developing story and will be updated.  UPDATE (Sept. 30, 1:23 UTC): Adds comments from Compound founder Robert Leshner.
