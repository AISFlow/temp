The team cited a “blocker bug” as the reason for the delay. Blocker bugs are broadly defined as issues that arise during the testing phase of a project’s development.  “Due to the nature of this bug, we do not feel comfortable bringing the mint live right now,” the team said in the thread, predicting a one-day delay.  The Y00ts team did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment on the specifics of the bug.  Y00ts has taken NFT land by storm in recent weeks, generating hype through a publicly announced whitelist that has included prominent NFT influencers and celebrity newcomers to crypto, including soccer player Wayne Rooney, rapper Lil Baby and former basketball star Allen Iverson, also known as ""The Answer.""  The Y00ts NFTs will be minted on the Solana blockchain through marketplace Magic Eden, with whitelisted accounts having to purchase 375 of the project’s DUST token before minting. (DUST is the official token of the DeGods ecosystem, which is the NFT collective that created the project.)  The lead-up to the mint has come with a fair share of controversy.

Bitcoin Open Interest Goes Up While Funding Rates Approach A Neutral Value As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC open interest has gained around $500 million over the last few days. The &apos;open interest&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of BTCUSD positions currently open on all derivatives exchanges. The metric takes into account for both short and long positions. When the value of this indicator goes up, it means investors are opening up more positions on exchanges right now. Since this usually leads to a higher amount of leverage in the market, this kind of trend can make the price of Bitcoin more volatile. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Must Make It Past This Threshold To Bounce Back On the other hand, the decline in the metric implies positions are closing up or liquidating on exchanges at the moment. Lower leverage usually leads to a more stable value of the crypto, and so such a trend can result in lesser volatility for BTC. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin open interest over the last few days: The value of the metric seems to have climbed up in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin open interest has observed an uplift during the past couple of days.

42373893,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvW9cp,1662318038,"MicroStrategy, With Bitcoin's Price Depressed, Looks to Lightning to Boost Usage, Saylor Says","Michael Saylor, who transformed a sleepy software firm into a cryptocurrency powerhouse via a (currently underwater) multi-billion dollar bet on bitcoin, is now having the non-crypto part of the business work on bitcoin-related projects as well.  Speaking to an audience at the Baltic Honeybadger conference in Riga, Latvia, on Saturday, the executive chairman and former CEO of MicroStrategy said the firm's developers are working on solutions that would allow to onboard large numbers of people onto the Lightning network, a payment network on top of bitcoin allowing faster and cheaper transactions.  Saylor announced on Aug. 2 he stepped down as MicroStrategy CEO, retaining his position as chairman of the board and taking on the new title of executive chairman. At the time, Saylor said his successor would be able to focus on the company's software business while he continued his bitcoin evangelization. Now it appears at least some of that software business is going to be used to help make it easier for people to use bitcoin, which potentially would increase the value of the cryptocurrency the company holds.  Speaking to the audience via video call, Saylor praised Lightning as “the most important thing going on in the world in technology.”  “MicroStrategy has got some R&D projects going on right now where we’re working on enterprise applications of Lightning: enterprise Lightning wallet, enterprise Lightning servers, enterprise authentication,” Saylor said on the video call.  He said MicroStrategy is looking for solutions that would allow companies to “roll out Lightning to a hundred thousand employees every day” or “open Lightning wallets for 10 million customers overnight.”  It’s still a very early stage and it’s yet to be seen whether any viable products would come out of this, Saylor said.  The announcement closely followed the one of the New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG) during the BitBlockBoom conference in Texas in August, opening a Lightning accelerator to bootstrap development on the protocol.  Saylor has been known as a fan of the Lightning Protocol for a while, and he reiterated his trust in the technology’s big future.  “The advantage of Lightning is not just that you could scale up bitcoin for billions of people, or drive the transaction cost to nearly nothing, but also, the ethos of bitcoin is to go very carefully and not move fast on the base layer without the universal consensus, but in Lightning, you can move much more aggressively developing functionality and take more risks with the applications than you can with the underlying bitcoin layer,” Saylor said.  Lightning protocol allows users to open payment channels with each other and exchange multiple transactions before settling on-chain, which helps minimize fees and confirmation time: in bitcoin, transactions normally take 10 minutes or longer to be considered final.  Read also: Lightning Sucks, But It Could Help Build a Bitcoin Economy  After the company's latest purchase in late June, MicroStrategy owns 129,699 BTC, worth about $2.58 billion at current prices. The company has seen its bitcoin holdings shrivel in dollar value recently as the price of the leading cryptocurrency has lost more than two-thirds of its value since November 2021.  Crypto isn't the only reason Saylor has been in the news lately. On Aug. 31, the attorney general of the District of Columbia sued him for allegedly not paying his taxes over the last 10 years.

42411387,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNR3a,1662303000,It Was Cruel Summer for the Bitcoin Market,"It’s Labor Day weekend, which means that summer is over. No, I do not care that the autumn season hasn’t officially started; summer is over when August is over.  Anyway, the finance world is usually slow in August because that’s when Wall Street’s finest unwind by doing work by the dim light of their mobile phones in the Hamptons instead of by the bright light of their offices in the Financial District. Now bitcoin (BTC), not to be upstaged, thought it would be best to buck that trend entirely by effectively erasing all of July’s price gains in August.  So let’s talk about summer markets.  – George Kaloudis  ______________________________________________________________________  First, let’s define summer as from the start of June to the end of August. If you look at bitcoin’s last two monthly candles, they look like mirror images of each other, with July’s green and August’s red (see below).  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Candles show how the price of an asset changed over a specified time period. The end of the lines (or wicks) on either side of the rectangles touch the low and high price during the time period, and the bottoms and tops of the rectangles (or candlesticks) represent the open and close price during that time period. Green candles mean the price went up; red candles mean the price went down.  In this case: bitcoin started July around $19.9K, hit a monthly low of about $18.8K, peaked around $24.7K in July, and ended July around $23.3K. It then started August around $23.3K, sank to $19.6K, climbed as high as $25.2K, and ended the month around $20.0K.  So you could say that bitcoin has taken the summer off – except June happened. Bitcoin opened June trading at about $31.8K, which means bitcoin’s price fell about 33% in the summer. To test the idea that “nothing happens in finance in the summer,” you could compare bitcoin’s summer to the S&P 500’s, which has lost about 4.3% since June (maybe things do happen in finance in the summer).  But an interesting fact pattern appears when looking at these summers: Bitcoin hadn’t had a negative summer since 2018 and the S&P 500 hadn’t had one since 2015.  Read more: Bitcoin's Price Rises Amid Uncertainty  You could insert an advertisement for the disclaimer that “past performance is not indicative of future results,” but also, we knew that. The only thing these historical time frames have in common over the years is the time frame itself. But we’ll look at these time frames for some insight anyway, because Mr. Market is emotional, irrational (a dog-themed cryptocurrency is worth billions (there are actually two of them!)) and inefficient (if it weren’t, prices would never move).  A cruel summer  Here are some truths: During the last two summers, BTC spot exchange volumes (the dollar value of bitcoin traded) were down about 43.5% in 2021 and about 14.0% in 2022 when compared to the preceding three months, respectively. Volumes were down in both comparable periods, but bitcoin’s price gained 33.1% in 2021 and lost 32.6% in 2022. So if the last two years are any indication, you can reasonably suggest that volumes are thinner in summer, but you probably wouldn’t suggest that it leads to a price increase or decrease.  As a disclaimer, the volume data comes from skew, which aggregated across seven trusted exchanges (Kraken, LMAX Digital, ItBit, Bitstamp, Gemini, Coinbase and FTX). As such, the absolute volume number is understated, but it works for comparison purposes.  If you then look forward to September, the same volume historically increases rather quickly. The spot exchange volumes in September were $10.7 billion and $51 billion for 2020 and 2021, respectively. Those values make up 38.9% and 42.7% of the preceding three months of volumes (not for nothing, there wasn’t a month-over-month volume increase between August and September in 2020).  So you could reasonably expect trading volume to pick up, and it typically does in the fourth quarter anyway. But the real question is: At what price?  Well, if previous Septembers are any indication (which they aren’t), it is valuable to know that bitcoin’s price has decreased in September every year since 2017. So does that mean, after bitcoin performed so poorly this summer, it will be absolutely, tremendously down in September?  Who knows? See, the thing about looking at tangible metrics of price performance and volume over time periods is there is one critical item missing in those numbers.  Narrative.  Sure, the expected volume increase in September might exacerbate whatever narrative is the flavor of the month, but it doesn’t necessarily indicate that bitcoin’s price will definitely fall this September.  2022’s post–summer narrative  So, what is the narrative? These days, traders are paying close attention to the Merge. The Merge is not on Bitcoin (it is on Ethereum), but ether (ETH) is the second most-heavily traded cryptocurrency, so the price action is related. Whether the Merge will be bearish or bullish is up for debate.  Read more: Ethereum’s Merge Projected for September According to 'Soft' Timeline  Instead, here’s the cynical narrative my skeptical mind is paying attention to: What if the Merge isn’t as successful as anticipated or, worse yet, it breaks Ethereum? To me that means that either: a) Bitcoin will get dragged down as collateral damage as traders will trade all crypto assets like they’ve failed, b) traders will flood out of ETH to bitcoin because BTC doesn’t really make these sorts of wholesale technology updates and that’s good or c) something in between.  Read more: Did Merge Optimism Lift Ether or Was It the S&P 500?  My bet is on c, but that’s because it’s easy to not be wrong if you hedge enough. In any event, we’ll be sure to revisit this at the end of September since that would mark the end of the third quarter and the start for the historically heavily traded fourth quarter. On top of that, the Merge will have been … merged … by then so there will be plenty to discuss around its degree of success.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/04/it-was-cruel-summer-for-the-bitcoin-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9a0c6df3227742d056e09171b4d4843c6527ccd-1613x1210.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
