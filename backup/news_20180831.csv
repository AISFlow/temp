42401876,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2isC,1535746527,Former Ripple CTO's Blockchain Project Coil Enters Closed Beta,"Coil, a new company founded by Ripple's former chief technology officer Stefan Thomas, has launched a closed beta.  The project – which aims to allow web content creators to better monetize their work – was announced in May, when Thomas departed Ripple. In an interview, Thomas detailed the closed beta, describing the initiative as a way to level the playing field for content creators.  ""If you're big you can have a subscription service like Netflix or Spotify. If you're big you can collect enough data about people to make a lot of money with ads like Facebook or Google,"" he said, going on to add:  ""If you're small it's actually very hard right now to make money on the web.""  Coil has not announced the beta publicly, Thomas said, though it has begun inviting certain select parties (those interested can sign up here).  Thus far, few websites have joined the platform, he continued, noting that ""we did some passive integrations with some sites like Wikipedia, Youtube, Twitch.""  While at Ripple, Thomas co-created Interledger, an interoperability protocol that facilitates payments across different networks. This technology, which is open source, is now being used as the basis of Coil.  Thomas also helped to create Codius, a smart contract platform that Ripple developed- in-house but ultimately shelved in 2015 due to technological challenges and a lack of compelling use cases. In June, however, Thomas revealed that Codius would be incorporated into Coil.  Coil allows readers, watchers and listeners to compensate content creators through micropayments. It's a model that has been tried multiple times in the industry, including the browser-focused startup Brave, which raised $35 million in an ICO last year. Thomas also cited Patreon and Flattr, but highlighted an important aspect that distinguishes Coil.  With Coil, he said, ""you're getting paid in real time,"" allowing content creators to explore new business models.  ""You can now make a service where maybe you need to rent a server for every user that comes by,"" he explained, adding that other possibilities include downloading or uploading a file, sending an SMS, or streaming music that triggers a licensing fee.  ""The website gets the money instantly as you're on the website, so they can actually react to it and provide extra services,"" Thomas said, concluding:  ""That's never been possible before, so we're excited to see what people build with that.""

42401894,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2j31,1535738408,Firefox Plans to Block Crypto Mining Malware in Future Releases,"Firefox, the popular Web browser, will soon begin automatically blocking crypto mining malware scripts as part of a wider performance-enhancing push.  The Mozilla Foundation, the not-for-profit organization behind the open-source browser, said Thursday that it intends to block trackers and other ""harmful practices"" in upcoming releases.  Some of these features, such as the anti-tracking function, are already available in its Firefox Nightly beta version.  The goal is to prevent third-party scripts from hampering the user experience, according to Mozilla vice president of product Nick Nguyen. These scripts are generally embedded within websites and can commandeer a user's computing power without their knowledge.  Scripts that hijack an individual's unused computer power to mine cryptocurrencies also fall into this category.  ""Deceptive practices that invisibly collect identifiable user information or degrade user experience are becoming more common,"" Nguyen wrote, adding:  ""For example, some trackers fingerprint users — a technique that allows them to invisibly identify users by their device properties, and which users are unable to control. Other sites have deployed cryptomining scripts that silently mine cryptocurrencies on the user's device. Practices like these make the web a more hostile place to be. Future versions of Firefox will block these practices by default.""  The Firefox Nightly version will be used to test the functionality of the new features. And if successful, users may begin seeing them enabled by default in the Firefox 63 release.  Mozilla joins other browser developers, including Opera and Google, in trying to protect its users from malicious miners, which can slow down the user experience at best and damage their computers at worst.  Opera announced in January that it was rolling out miner protection to the smartphone version of its browser, which would also be active by default. The company already offered cryptominer protection on its desktop version.  Google, meanwhile, has banned any cryptomining apps from its Play Store, though it has not made any official statements regarding automatically blocking scripts embedded within websites.

42401886,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2ix7,1535730828,Ethereum Developers Move to Alter Blockchain's Economics In Next Upgrade,"A proposal that, if enacted, would change how much new cryptocurrency is released on the world's second-largest blockchain was finalized Friday, with developers agreeing to include the code for such a change as part of ethereum's upcoming October upgrade, Constantinople.  Speaking on a video call, a group of 14 developers agreed to support code that would reduce the amount of new cryptocurrency introduced on ethereum to 2 ETH per block, down from 3 ETH today, by implementing an updated version of an ethereum improvement upgrade named EIP 1234.  Notably, investors and miners who attended a meeting on which upgrades should be included in Constantinople last week were not invited to this week's meeting and did not attend.  But while this week's meeting featured a more limited number of attendees, those present agreed that the difficulty bomb — a piece of code intended to add time pressure to upgrades, and that has influenced discussion of Constantinople's code — will be delayed for a 12-month period.  Yet another hard fork, or network-wide software upgrade, will be planned to occur 8 months from the upgrade to Constantinople, developers agreed.  With controversy building on the issuance change – and multiple parties arguing for different outcomes – a reduction to 2 ETH was positioned as the conservative choice.  Depending on the perceived outcome of the change to ethereum's code, security researcher Martin Swende suggested revisiting the question after the 8-month period.  ""I think we also need to be conservative with changes and make changes incrementally, and not dictate changes against the will of the community, but apply conservative measures in doing changes but try to keep them within the intent of the community,"" Swende said during the call.  Speaking in the meeting, Casper developer for the Ethereum Foundation Danny Ryan echoed this point, stating that because issuance is likely to drop considerably in an upcoming upgrade that will find ethereum making a dramatic changes in how the network is secured, a decision in the interim should be seen as ""incremental compromises until we get to the vision.""  ""Everything I view in the issuance discussion is an incremental compromise to encourage the community and move things sanely until we move to proof-of-stake, which will bring issuance down to the range of 0.5 or 1 percent per year, and at that point I think the community will certainly be happy. These are incremental compromises until we get to that goal,"" Ryan said.  What's next?  While several opposing parties have come forward on the topic of issuance reduction, today's move was touted by developers as a balance between competing voices.  In the past week, several community members have argued that ethereum's issuance model is over-inflated, pointing to a voting website, that saw 72 percent of participating ether holders vote for a reduction to 1 ETH. Such a reduction could have an impact on the price of ether, pushing up its fiat value as miners would earn less income for securing the blockchain.  However, already grappling with the introduction of optimized mining hardware, ASICs, on the platform, others argued that too high a reduction would force miners to mine other cryptocurrencies, reducing the security of the platform.  As such, combined with ASIC-resistant research, developers are hoping a majority will be on board with the proposal.  ""We have a strong user base of investors who want to reduce as much as possible but we have miners that said they'd agree to a small reduction, and that's why i think we should go with 2 ETH per block,"" author of the proposal, Afri Schoedon, said.  While a decision has yet to be made on an algorithm change that would to restrict the use of ASICs, a type of specialized mining hardware, from the platform, speaking in the meeting, several developers argued that research should continue in this direction, while Ryan said there might be potential funding from the Ethereum Foundation.  ""There's a potential for a grant here,"" Ryan said.  Several further non-contentious upgrades were also confirmed for the upcoming hard fork.  As detailed by CoinDesk, these include EIP 145, EIP 1014, EIP 1052, and EIP 1283, which work to increase efficiency and scalability.  ""Those are all accepted and we are all on board with those being the four Constaninope EIPs,"" ethereum developer Piper Merriam concluded.

In track dubbed ""Not Alike,"" fellow artist Royce Da 5'9' – who guest features on the piece – raps:  ""Remember everybody used to bite nickel, now everybody doing bitcoin.""  The album was launched on midnight Thursday in a surprise announcement by Eminem, according to reports. His previous release was ""Revival"" in December 2017.  While the crypto citation is unlikely to bump the price of bitcoin, it comes as the latest mainstream entertainment industry reference to the top cryptocurrency by market valuation.  In one of the most memorable mentions, chat-show host Ellen DeGeneres took a humorous look at cryptocurrency in her regular show back in February. ""Everybody is talking about bitcoin,"" she said, but, ""nobody understands it.""  She went on to say about investors in bitcoin, ""You'll either be a millionaire or you'll be totally broke.""  A month later, John Oliver poked fun at the bitcoin community and reminded viewers to take care when investing in his ""Last Week Tonight"" show. Grabbing the headlines at the time, he compared bitcoin's volatile price to a $15,000 Beanie Baby and said cryptocurrency was gambling, not investing.  The rap industry has helped raise the profile of cryptocurrency in ways other than recordings too.  Rapper 50 Cent's move to accept bitcoin for his 2014 ""Animal Ambition"" album was reported in January to have made him a crypto millionaire, though he denied owning bitcoin in a bankruptcy court case a month later.  And in March, Young Dirty, the son of late Wu Tan Clan rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard, was involved in the launch of a new cryptocurrency called Dirty Coin. The token was intended to help raise funding for an upcoming Young Dirty album, as well as a means for fans to access shows and buy merchandise.  Most recently, in May, Snoop Dogg performed at an event in New York set up to celebrate XRP, a cryptocurrency associated with blockchain payments startup Ripple.

42401900,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2j8v,1535720457,Neo Price Bleeds 40% to End August as Worst-Performing Big Crypto,"NEO's dismal performance in August has likely strengthened the already strong bear grip on its market.  Down 39.6 percent month-on-month in August, it is the biggest loser among the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap and analysis by CoinDesk.  Throughout the month, the world's 14th largest cryptocurrency has moved in tandem with the broader market, which took a beating in August due to SEC's rejection of multiple bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  Notably, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies was printing more than $100 billion loss just two weeks into the month as the metric sank below $200 billion for the first time inover eight months. At the same time, NEO was reporting monthly lows below $14.50.  However, the broader market made a considerable rebound in the final two weeks of August, regaining nearly $40 billion of the lost value in total market capitalization.  Still, the rally towards August's end was not enough for many cryptocurrencies to salvage the considerable losses endured in the weeks prior, including the likes of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the markets largest assets, reporting double-digit monthly losses.  NEO also recovered 35 percent from the lows seen on Aug. 14 but is still a standout performer in the losers column.  Monthly Loser  NEO  Monthly performance: -39.62 percent  All-time high: $162.11  Closing price on August 31: $31.73  Current market price: $19.16  Rank as per market capitalization: 15  NEO came stumbling into August thanks to a less than impressive performance in July when its price declined more than 40 percent month to month. The resulting short-term oversold conditions, however, did little to put a bid under the cryptocurrency.  Prices continued their descent from a starting price of $28.87 on Aug. 1 to its monthly low of $14.38 set on Aug. 14, at the time representing a 50.16 percent two-week depreciation.  The cryptocurrency made a bit of a comeback during the last two weeks of August, climbing 33 percent from its monthly low to a final price of just over $19 on Aug. 31. All in all, NEO printed a 39.62 percent loss during the month of August.  Monthly Chart  The above chart paints the picture of a cryptocurrency stuck in limbo.  A rebound from the key support of $14, though encouraging, is not enough to for the bulls to make a strong comeback. Only a break above $30 (former support-turned-resistance) would indicate a bottom has been made.  However, it could be a tough task, as the 5-month and 10-month moving averages (MAs) reside above current prices, indicating the path of least resistance is still to the downside. Further, with six of the last seven months flashing red, it is clear that bears are in control.  Still, the monthly candle does offer some hope for bulls due to its lengthy bottom wick, which indicates there was considerable buying after price touched the $14 support.  A monthly close above current resistance at $34.00 would return the longer term trend to bullish favor and set the scope for a rally to $50 - the location of prior support and 5-month moving average. On the other hand, a close below current support of $14 would confirm the bearish strength and likely send prices to the prior support of $7.70.

According to a news report from NHK on Thursday, the NPA will budget 35 million yen ($315,000) for 2019 to fund creation of the product – outsourcing technological development of the software to the private sector.  The NPA said the software will track the flow of blockchain transactions flagged as suspicious and ""visualize and locate"" the individuals sending or receiving the cryptocurrency.  The effort apparently comes in response to the increasing number of suspected criminal cases in Japan that involve cryptocurrency. Given the anonymity of blockchain transactions, police forces in the country are facing difficulties when conducting further investigations.  Early this year, the NPA disclosed it had received 669 reports of suspected money laundering from Japanese crypto exchanges in just eight months of 2017, as reported by CoinDesk.  Further, according to an annual reported revealed by the agency in March, hackers stole at least $6.2 million-worth of cryptocurrencies from Japanese users' exchange and wallet accounts in 2017.  The cryptocurrency industry in Japan also took a hit in January after the Coincheck exchange reported a $520 million hack, which prompted calls from regulators to implement better crypto anti-money laundering and security measures.

42429611,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM05Th,1535713220,Bitcoin Price Loses 10% In August But Long-Term Bottom May Be In,"Bitcoin (BTC) is all set to end August with double digit-losses, but a closer look at the price action suggest better times lie ahead for the leading cryptocurrency.  At time of writing, BTC is trading at $6,940 – down 10.7 percent from the month's opening price of $7,727, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. However, losses would have been much bigger had prices not recovered from the six-week lows below $5,900 seen on Aug. 14.  Indeed, the bitcoin market has witnessed a solid two-way business this month.  Sellers dominated the first half as the markets reacted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) disapproval of a Winklevoss bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in late July. However, by mid-August, the bears had run out of steam and the technical charts were calling for a corrective rally. Accordingly, BTC picked up a bid and moved above $6,400 in the third week.  Notably, the short-term bullish reversal signals gained more credence after the cryptocurrency shrugged off the SEC's rejection of nine other ETF proposals on Aug. 22.  Further, BTC/USD short positions in the futures market hit record lows, signaling the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 set in December likely ended around the psychological support of $6,000.  Consequently, the emboldened bulls pushed BTC to highs above $7,000 earlier this week.  So, while BTC is reporting a 10 percent monthly loss overall, the technical charts indicate there is a reason to be optimistic going forward.  Monthly chart  As seen in the above chart (prices as per Bitfinex), a long wick (tail) is attached to the current monthly candle, which is widely considered a sign of trend weakness – that is, the bears failed in their attempt to push prices back to the June low of $5,755 and the bulls regained some lost ground.  Further, the bears have failed three times in the last 10 weeks to keep the cryptocurrency below the support at $6,000.  So, it seems safe to say the cryptocurrency has likely charted a long-term bottom around $6,000 and hence prices could revisit July highs above $8,500 in the next month or two.  View  Bitcoin's long-tailed monthly candle indicates the long-term bear market likely bottomed out around $6,000.  A break above the July high of $8,507 would confirm a bullish reversal.  A monthly close below $6,000 (major support) would signal a revival of the sell-off from the December high of $20,000.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The company said in an announcement that it has inked a share transfer agreement for 100 percent of an exchange called Everybody's Bitcoin on Friday. The acquisition appears to be costing the firm 265 million yen, or $2.4 million, when it goes through on Oct. 1.  Explaining the move, Rakuten said it believes ""the role of cryptocurrency-based payments in e-commerce, offline retail and in P2P payments will grow in the future,"" adding:  ""In order to provide cryptocurrency payment methods smoothly, we believe it is necessary for us to provide a cryptocurrency exchange function.""  Further, the firm indicated that the acquisition is in response to demands from a growing number of foreign exchange customers on its securities business arm, who have been calling for the offering of a cryptocurrency exchange service.  Launched in March 2017, Everybody's Bitcoin is one of the several unlicensed crypto exchanges in Japan that came under scrutiny from Japan's Financial Services Agency after the Coincheck hack in January, as the regulator sought business and security improvements.  With the planned acquisition, Rakuten aims to assist the exchange in enhancing its internal systems in an effort to meet with the regulator's requirements for obtaining a license.  According to today's announcement, Everybody's Bitcoin reported a net loss of around $444,000 in the fiscal year ended March 30, 2018.  The acquisition deal follows a previous report that Rakuten is also planning to launch its own cryptocurrency as a way to help the group expand its global user base.

Messaging giant LINE has become one of the first publicly traded companies to have launched a proprietary blockchain mainnet with its own cryptocurrency.  Revealed in an announcement Friday, the firm said that the genesis block of its LINK Chain was produced on Aug. 23. The messaging giant now aims to gradually issue a total of 1 billion of the network's LINK tokens, of which 800 million will be distributed to public users while the rest will be held as a company reserve.  Rather than adopt an initial coin offering model, LINE will issue the tokens as an incentive for users who participate in its decentralized applications (dapps) built on top of the LINK Chain network. According to LINE's white paper, it is now eyeing a deadline in September for the rollout of an initial two dapps, with over 10 to be released by the first quarter of 2019.  A spokesperson for LINE explained some of the technical aspects of the blockchain protocol, telling CoinDesk:  ""We need fast confirmation time for a service-oriented blockchain platform. Thus the consensus algorithm of LINK Chain is delegated proof-of-stake consensus and practical Byzantine fault tolerance.""  The LINK token will be added to LINE's newly launched BITBOX cryptocurrency exchange for trading in September, as an alternative way for users to acquire the crypto asset, the release added. The tokens can be further used as a payments means within LINE's existing ecosystem.  The firm specified in the announcement that BITBOX is currently not a licensed exchange platform in Japan by Financial Services Agency. As such, residents in the firm's home country are only able to receive what's called a LINK Point for the time being, which will be exchangeable for the full crypto asset once BITBOX becomes licensed in Japan.  Intriguingly, LINE, a Japanese firm, launched the blockchain and its exchange platform via a new subsidiary established in April in Singapore called LINE Tech Plus PTE.  The launch marks the latest move by the company in seeking to integrate blockchain into its existing business ecosystem.  Early in August, LINE also announced an initiative to launch a $10 million token fund to foster development in the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem.

According to a blog post on Thursday, the company now supports trading of four types of assets – bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, and dogecoin – on its iOS mobile app.  The announcement came amid various tweets online yesterday indicating the service appeared to be also available on the desktop version of Yahoo Finance – although, the feature is not visible on desktop browsers at the moment. Yahoo Finance said in the announcement it pans to extend the service to Android, desktop and mobile web platforms in the future.  For the new feature, Yahoo partnered with TradeIt, a platform that integrates with brokerage services to act as a hub for trading financial assets. TradeIt notably integrated with the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase last year, according to a statement at the time, though it isn't yet clear which brokerage Yahoo is connected with for the new offering.  The financial news service first started its partnership with TradeIt in September 2017, letting users carry out in-app trading of traditional financial assets. The exposure to cryptos at the time was limited to data on prices and portfolio performance.  The site first started tracking bitcoin's price in 2014, as CoinDesk reported. Last year, the company expanded its price tracking service to cover over 100 cryptocurrencies across all its platforms globally.

The firm will assign 1,000 of its employees to a two-year training program which will cover various digital technology-related, from blockchain to 3D printing to drones, Digiday reported Thursday.  Called Digital Accelerators, the program will begin this January, according to the report.  PwC Digital Accelerators head Sarah McEneaney told the publication that the move is part of a wider effort to help increase the firm's subject-matter expertise.  ""My job is to future proof our workforce ... It just seems table stakes at this point that people should have more technology skills. It's needed for us to remain competitive and to be responsive for what our clients are also going through.""  The training should make employees more efficient as well, reducing the number of hours they spend working on problems, McEneany contended. These savings will be transferred to PwC's customers.  Roughly 3,500 out of the more than 46,000 employees working at PwC are said to have applied for spots in the program.  During the program, the 1,000 selected employees will work with clients while taking roughly 10 hours worth of courses each week. Data and analytics, which will include information collection and blockchain, will make up the first part of the program's curriculum.

42429597,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM04th,1535677233,Apple Abruptly Orders Coinbase Wallet to Remove Crypto Collectible,"It seems iPhone users won't have access to the crypto collectible craze anytime soon.  The news comes after forthcoming video game War Riders was featured on the Coinbase Wallet iOS app and then quickly withdrawn. In War Riders, players drive around an apocalyptic wasteland, building up armies of vehicles – vehicles represented by non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, on a blockchain.  According to screenshots obtained by CoinDesk, a Coinbase staffer told Cartified, the company behind the game, via Discord:  ""Quick heads up – we will be removing from the iOS version as we're not able to highlight dapps that facilitate purchase of digital goods.""  The employee explained that War Riders was the only app listed within the wallet that sells NFTs.  Notably, CryptoKitties, the famous decentralized application (dapp) for buying and breeding digital cats, isn't even featured. Although War Riders remains listed on the Android version of the Coinbase Wallet app.  Stepping back, Apple has long had a complicated relationship with crypto in its app store. Coinbase was itself removed for a time early on (but that was a long time back). Plus an early game that allowed users to earn bitcoin for playing was also removed.  Viktor Radchenko, CEO of Trust Wallet, tweeted about the same problem in June.  ""Experience with Apple is just terrible,"" he told CoinDesk via Telegram. ""No communication from there on how to work with NFT's or even with cryptocurrencies.""  Yet, within Apple's app store review guidelines, there's no specific language forbidding NFTs precisely. Radchenko said Apple has indicated they are forbidden under its ""In-App Purchase"" rules.  Neither Apple nor Coinbase have responded to repeated requests for comment.  Featured dapps  The controversy started Monday after Coinbase enabled native hosting of the dapp's NFTs on its app.  That was the first day War Riders got native support for its NFT on Coinbase, meaning users could not only find the game by name, but also, should they purchase an NFT, it would show up in the Coinbase Wallet, according to Vlad Kartashov, CEO of Cartified.  By late Tuesday night, Kartashov informed CoinDesk that War Riders was no longer showing up as ""featured dapp"" within the Coinbase Wallet at all.  While Cartified is not officially describing the gameplay yet, it's currently selling premium vehicles, of which there are only 30,000 premium vehicles of a maximum 1,180,000 vehicles throughout the whole game.  According to Kartashov, it's not for a lack of interest that the game got removed.  ""We have a very thriving community on Discord, and people have already been forming clans even though clans have not been announced officially,"" he told CoinDesk.  Plus, the game itself seems well suited to attract fans of post-apocalyptic games, even those that are tired of the same old, same old design.  ""These vehicles will also be modernized and will not be from the 70s like it is in the most post-apocalyptic games,"" he said.  Another token  Beside the NFT, War Riders' players will also use an ERC-20 token called benzene (or BZN) within the game as money. BZN will be released to players through caches that will be algorithmically generated by the game within its world.  But there's a twist here. BZN will function as a more traditional cryptocurrency outside the game, but players that acquire the token within the game must use their vehicles to safely get the BZN back to their garage in order to use it in the real world. Other players will be able to steal it on the way.  Its premium NFTs will also come with full ""tanks"" of BZN, so it will be on the market in small quantities before the game goes live.  Speaking to Cartified's mission for BZN, Kartashov said, ""No BZN will ever be for sale. There's no ICO or anything like that. We are only selling non-fungible tokens.""  Cartified is only running an NFT pre-sale right now. Buyers are not yet receiving the actual tokens.  Kartashov has not been able to get any more clarity about the specific objection from Apple to his app, but concluded:  ""I'm not sure what's exactly bad with people wanting to play games.""
