42378480,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iIqr,1450128705,NBER Report: Blockchain Could Shift Balance of Corporate Power,"The blockchain could dramatically change corporate governance by reducing legal insider trading and making shareholder voting more reliable, according to a new report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).  Authored by New York University (NYU) professor David Yermack, the second working paper by the US non-profit explores how the widespread adoption of distributed ledgers could impact investors, shareholders, auditors and other participants in corporate governance.  Citing recent proofs-of-concept at major stock exchanges, the NBER paper explores a future where blockchains are used to record equities in corporations, providing real-time insight into corporate share transfers.  The report goes on to label the blockchain as potential enabler of the most important changes to corporate governance ""since the 1933 and 1934 securities acts in the US"", stating:  ”Managerial ownership could become much more transparent, with insider buying and selling detected by the market in real time, and chicanery such as the backdating of stock compensation becoming much more difficult, if not impossible. Corporate voting could become more accurate, and strategies such as ‘empty voting’ that are designed to separate voting rights from other aspects of share ownership could become more difficult to execute secretly.""  ""Any and all of these changes,"" it says, ""could dramatically affect the balance of power between directors, managers, and shareholders.”  Notably, the report sees the technology as being first adopted in developing nations where existing recordkeeping systems are inadequate, market regulators are ineffective and smartphone penetration levels are high.  That said, the report speculates that the open, public bitcoin blockchain may not be the version of the technology that becomes widely embraced as a solution to these issues.  Though Yermack states that bitcoin has proven its reliability as the world’s longest-running decentralized ledger, he notes drawbacks to its model.  “If a manager sells shares of his own stock, I assume that the public will see not only the sale but will also discern the selling manager’s identity. In practice, this may or may not occur, because assets on blockchains are typically held in anonymous ‘digital wallets’ identified only by complex labels akin to serial numbers,” he continues.  Checks and balances  In a section on corporate governance, the report suggested that registering equities and securities on the blockchain would lead to ""faster, cheaper trade execution"" and greater transparency as all transactions on such a blockchain would be visible to the network.  However, Yermack noted that this was based on several assumptions about how such a blockchain network would be constructed.  ""This claim assumes not only that a distributed ledger of share ownership can be viewed by the public, but also that observers can identify the holders of individual shares and the counterparties of important transactions,"" the paper reads.  Here, the paper states that activist shareholders, those whose equity stakes serve as a strategic way to influence the company, might become less common due to the proliferation of the technology.  Investment managers, in turn, would likely trade less often due to what the paper said would be heightened concern about ""sending adverse signals to the market"" for fear of reputational risk.  ""The net effect would likely cut into managers’ profits from legal insider trading, and firms might have to pay them more to offset this loss,"" the report reads.  Voting transparency  Perhaps the most impactful change the technology could bring about, according to the report, would be to motivate shareholders to more directly participate in corporate decision-making through voting.  Due to the transparency and accuracy of digital ledgers, stock managers would be less able to manipulate outcome, the report argues, while votes themselves would lead to more verifiable results.  ""The net effect would be more frequent election of dissident outside candidates representing shareholder activists or other groups and more frequent defeats of management proposals related to compensation and governance,"" the report reads.  So-called empty voting, whereby investors borrow shares to acquire voting rights in secrecy would also be eliminated, the paper argues, as they would now be visible to the public, enabling opponents of such actions to counteract such measures.  ""Such a stock loan would be immediately transparent, providing notice to shareholders, management, and regulators of a redistribution of voting power,"" it reads, adding:  ""Opponents could take steps to counteract the acquisition of votes by an empty voter, and regulators could enjoin voting of the shares.""  Overhauling accounting  In what may be its boldest prediction, the paper indicates that blockchains could automate the accounting industry, thus shaving $50bn a year in corporate expenditures.  ""Instead of relying on the auditing industry, which itself has been subject to moral hazard and agency problems, each user could costlessly create their own financial statements from the blockchain’s data, for whatever time period they wished,"" the report reads.  Though eliminating the accounting practices of today, the paper speculated that the industry could reinvent itself through services that interpret blockchain data.  Elsewhere, the report predicts real-time accounting would make it difficult for earnings reports to be manipulated, while reducing the likelihood of suspicious or illegal asset transfers in times of financial distress.  Still, such a future is not without its own drawbacks, as the paper concludes by noting that both open and permissioned blockchains need strong governance models to operate effectively:  ""Just as is the case with a stock exchange, the regulations embedded in a blockchain’s software code could favor some participating companies at the expense of others, and therefore the authority to change these underlying rules could be critically important.""

Former Sungard president and CEO Cristóbal Conde will serve as a non-executive board member, according to a company release. SunGard, founded in 1982, was recently acquired for $5.1bn by Fidelity National Information Services (FIS).  Chris Church, who acted as chief executive for the Americas and head of the SWIFT's securities devision, will become Digital Asset's chief business development officer.  “With more than 50 years of combined experience in the financial and technology sectors, Cris and Chris have a deep understanding not only of the marketplace, but of what we are building and they will be invaluable to our continued growth,"" Digital Asset CEO Blythe Masters said in a statement.  The leadership team buildout follows a steady period of acquisitions for the startup.  Since the summer, the company has acquired blockchain startups Hyperledger, Bits of Proof and Blockstack.io, more firms than any other in the industry.

42378474,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iIlp,1450104707,BitGreet Lets You Gift Bitcoin with Christmas Cards,"A service called BitGreet is letting users spread more than just seasonal cheer – it lets senders attach bitcoin to its Christmas e-cards.  The commission-free service was launched last Christmas and it has already seen some 1,000 cards delivered, according to its co-founder.  BitGreet  is a service from CoinCorner, a bitcoin exchange in the Isle of Man. Co-founder Daniel Scott said:  ""We were thinking of a fun way to try and increase bitcoin adoption in the office one afternoon. It was nearly Christmas at the time and we were in the festive spirit so we came up with the idea of a digital bitcoin Christmas card.""  How it works  To send some Christmas cryptocurrency, users first select a card design from the BitGreet website. They then enter the receiver's email address and the amount of bitcoin they wish to send.  Senders then see a checkout page, similar to merchant checkout pages from BitPay or Coinbase, telling them the amount of bitcoin they have to deposit to a CoinCorner address.  You don't have to be CoinCorner customer to send a card with some bitcoin slipped in. Neither do you have to upload any data to satisfy Know-Your-Customer rules.  After four confirmations on the blockchain, the recipient gets an email containing a link to a page that enables them to send the coins to the digital wallet of their choice.  Beginners' protection  BitGreet has also built a 'clawback' mechanism in case a sender made a mistake and wants to claim their coins back.  Every card sent contains a link to a page that lets the sender retrieve the coins. This only works, of course, if the coins haven't already been claimed by the receiver.  There is an additional caveat to using BitGreet: senders have to trust CoinCorner, at least temporarily, with the funds they're attaching to greeting cards. That's because the funds sit at a CoinCorner-controlled address while they wait to be claimed by the receiver.  Scott addressed the issue:  ""Yes, we hold them in escrow, so to speak. This is because the end recipient may not have a wallet already. Also, if your recipient doesn’t claim them, then you can get them back easily. Obviously you need to trust CoinCorner but we don’t see that as being an issue – we’ve been around for over two years now and have over 25,000 registered users. We are nice guys.""

42378483,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iIud,1450096355,ING Exec: ‘All Our Business Lines’ Involved in Blockchain Exploration,"“It’s quite an effort.”  So says Mark Buitenhek, global head of transaction services for Dutch banking and financial services group ING.  In a new interview, Buitenhek told CoinDesk that the Amsterdam-based bank is pushing forward with a broad-reaching initiative to explore blockchain technology – a process that includes working with a global group of banks, as well as conducting in-house experimentation across a range of departments.  ING was among a group of five banks that announced in November that they were joining the global banking consortium headed up by startup R3 CEV.  Buitenhek said:  “All our business lines are involved here. The transaction services organization which I am heading for ING globally, our financial markets, our lending services department is involved. There are people from IT involved, people from operations, client coverage staff.”  According to Buitenhek, the bank sees the potential for blockchain applications in a variety of banking and finance contexts, including securities and trade settlement, internal transacting, e-identity and also as a backbone for connected devices.  “We do see the potential – we don’t know if it’s going to work. But if it’s going to work, it’s going to be big. That’s why we want to invest time, effort and money now,” he said.  Staff-led initiative  Buitenhek said that one of the driving forces behinds the bank's efforts to explore bitcoin and the blockchain that underlies it is the fact that a large number of its staff had already been experimenting with the technology on their own initiative.  “Two years ago – somewhere in 2013 – we started to look at this. We found out that over 100 of our IT staff were playing with applications of blockchain, including bitcoin. We didn’t even know about it.”  The process of looking at the technology, he said, is now very much a “bottom-up” process and reflects a change over what had previously been a top-down, hierarchical process.  “It’s also a new sign of the times,” he added.  Efforts 'paying off'  As one of a group of more than 30 banks working collaboratively, ING said that it was in strong support of the R3 effort and expects that much of the “granular” heavy lifting will take place over the next year.  The early efforts appears to be paying off. In a recent interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, R3 director of research and author Tim Swanson suggested that a distributed ledger connecting consortium members could be active as early as a year from now.  Buitenhek struck a positive note about the initial phases of the project:  “The jury is still out, but we’re really pleased to be part of it. The first meetings have already taken place and the guys we send to those meetings come back very [enthusiastic]. So, for now, we have the feeling we’re on the right track.”  Seeking problems to solve  Despite the blockchain's promise, Buitenhek suggested that the outcome of ING’s exploration of the technology will rest on whether any operational problems can be met.  “We need to look at our problems and see if the blockchain is a solution rather than the other way around,” he said. “And that is one of the things we’re focusing on, is making sure that our people don’t come up with fantastic application of what is possible with blockchain, but it really isn't an answer to a problem.”  He pointed to efforts in recent decades to onboard new types of technology within the banking system that, despite early hype and millions spent, failed to have a significant enough impact to elicit sufficient demand and justify the investments.  To that end, Buitenhek went on to say, the bank plans to spend the next several years looking at the technology internally, as well as externally through the R3 consortium.  He said:  “That’s the way we look at this and we’re really going to spend effort, time, money in the coming, let’s say, two to three years ... And if it’s not evident or clear in those two years that something will come of it, then we’ll stop and look at something else.”  “But we want to try right now and see what comes out. And that’s why we joined R3,” he said.
