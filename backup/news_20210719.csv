Athletes should be forbidden from “receiving or using digital yuan during the Beijing Olympics,” Republicans Marsha Blackburn, Cynthia Lummis and Roger Wicker said in a Monday letter to the U.S. Olympic Committee leadership, citing privacy concerns.      “We cannot allow America’s athletes to be used as a Trojan horse to increase the Chinese Communist Party’s ability to spy on the United States,” Lummis told CoinDesk.

42406971,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8l1s,1626730792,Por qué bitcoin podría ser algo bueno para El Salvador,"La noticia de que El Salvador adoptaría BTC como moneda de curso legal para las transacciones en el país ha causado un gran revuelo. Bitcoin ha conquistado su primer país. Las reacciones han variado desde frases como “vaya, esto es grande para bitcoin"" hasta “esto no va a acabar bien"".      Como siempre, la verdad está probablemente en algún lugar del medio. No es un gran éxito para bitcoin, pero podría funcionar bastante bien para El Salvador. Y, lo que es más importante, podría establecer un caso de uso en el mundo real para bitcoin que no implique el colapso de todo el sistema monetario mundial. No creo que bitcoin vaya a sustituir al dólar como principal moneda de liquidación y reserva mundial, pero eso no significa que no pueda ser bueno para algunos países.    Frances Coppola, columnista de CoinDesk, es escritora y una conferencista especializada en banca, finanzas y economía. Su libro, ""The Case for People's Quantitative Easing"", explica cómo funcionan la creación moderna de dinero y la flexibilización cuantitativa, y aboga por el dinero helicóptero para ayudar a las economías a salir de la recesión.    El Salvador, que posee 6,5 millones de habitantes, es una economía “dolarizada"". No tiene una moneda propia y en su lugar utiliza el dólar estadounidense como moneda nacional. La relación de El Salvador con Estados Unidos no es como la de un estado estadounidense ni como la de un territorio como Puerto Rico. Es un país soberano e independiente que elige utilizar el dólar en lugar de emitir su propia moneda. El Salvador no está sujeto a la legislación estadounidense y el gobierno de Estados Unidos no tiene jurisdicción allí.    Read this article in English.    Al no producir su propia moneda, el gobierno de El Salvador no puede imprimir dinero. Tampoco se beneficia de la creación de dinero de la Reserva Federal, que no es en absoluto responsable de asegurar que ese país tenga suficientes dólares para su uso interno. Por lo tanto, El Salvador debe pedir prestado o generar los dólares que necesita.      Puede generar dólares exportando más de lo que importa y recibiendo remesas en dólares de sus ciudadanos en el extranjero. Si esas dos fuentes no proporcionan suficientes dólares para satisfacer las necesidades internas, tanto el sector privado como el gobierno pueden pedir prestado en los mercados internacionales.      Actualmente, El Salvador exporta menos de lo que importa, pero las remesas son lo suficientemente grandes como para garantizar que su cuenta corriente —el valor neto de todas sus transacciones con el resto del mundo— siga siendo ligeramente positiva. Por lo tanto, en el total, El Salvador recibe entradas netas de dólares. Pero el gobierno se está endeudando mucho: en los últimos dos años la deuda pública ha aumentado hasta superar el 90% del producto interior bruto (PBI), y los costes de los préstamos están aumentando. No está claro cuánto más podrá pedir prestado el gobierno.      Además, los flujos de dólares son volátiles. Hace sólo unos años un desplome de los precios de las materias primas hizo que las entradas de dólares en países como Nigeria y Angola se invirtieran bruscamente, obligándoles a vender sus reservas de dólares para mantener la paridad con esa moneda. Una economía dolarizada como la de El Salvador no necesita reservas para mantener la vinculación de su moneda, pero sí para mantener la liquidez de los bancos nacionales, las empresas y los hogares. La escasez de dólares puede obligar a cerrar sus bancos y a reducir drásticamente el gasto público.      En un informe titulado Artículo IV, de 2019, el Fondo Monetario Internacional dijo que las reservas de dólares de El Salvador son demasiado bajas para su economía. El país necesita más ingresos en dólares, y eso significa desarrollar industrias de exportación y alentar a los trabajadores en el extranjero a enviar más dólares a casa. También le eayudaría obtener algunos ingresos de sus reservas actuales; los tipos de interés casi nulos de las inversiones seguras en dólares no son algo bueno para países como El Salvador.      Teniendo en cuenta todo esto, adoptar bitcoin como segunda moneda no parece una mala idea. Hay varios beneficios potenciales.      En primer lugar, el uso de bitcoin para enviar remesas podría ser más fácil, más barato y más rápido para los trabajadores en el extranjero en comparación con el uso de servicios de envío de dinero o transferencias bancarias, lo que podría aumentar el número de remesas. Por supuesto, éstas tendrían que ser cambiadas por dólares dentro de El Salvador, pero eso podría lograrse con una aplicación móvil conectada a un exchange de criptomonedas.      Como alternativa, los ciudadanos podrían utilizar BTC directamente para pagar bienes y servicios, y los comerciantes podrían disponer de los medios para cambiar BTC por dólares. Obviamente, existe el riesgo de que los intercambios de BTC fracasen debido a la falta de liquidez en dólares dentro de El Salvador. Por esa razón, el gobierno salvadoreño propuso establecer un fondo fiduciario de $150 millones en el banco estatal de desarrollo Bandesal, que garantizaría la liquidez de los intercambios. Y se está preparando una versión de la aplicación Strike para que la utilicen los salvadoreños, aunque todavía no está claro cómo funcionaría exactamente.      En segundo lugar, la diversificación de las reservas de dólares del país en BTC podría crear oportunidades de obtención de rendimientos y aumentar así el tamaño de las reservas.      Como tercer punto, una economía parcialmente ""bitcoinizada"" podría ser atractiva como residencia para los inversores de bitcoin y como sede para las empresas del sector, lo que podría aumentar el PBI del país. También crearía una oportunidad para desarrollar nuevos negocios basados en bitcoin. El gobierno ya ha propuesto un plan para utilizar la energía geotérmica en la alimentación de la minería de esta criptomoneda.      Si este plan de ""bitcoinización"" parcial funciona, El Salvador podría aumentar tanto sus reservas como su PIB, reduciendo la presión sobre los costes de endeudamiento del gobierno y liberando potencialmente dinero para programas sociales.    Riesgos de recesión    Sin embargo, existen graves riesgos.      El mayor, por encima de todos, es la posibilidad de que el país se quede sin dólares. La diversificación en bitcoin puede mejorar la cantidad de reservas, pero el precio de BTC es notoriamente volátil. Un desplome como el de 2018 acabaría con el 80% de las reservas de dólares del país, lo que podría obligar a los bancos a cerrar y hacer imposible que el gobierno cumpla con sus obligaciones en dólares. El Salvador entró en default en 2017. La diversificación en BTC podría forzarlo a otro escenario de impago.      Una caída de BTC también perjudicaría gravemente a los salvadoreños que habían adoptado total o parcialmente esa criptomoneda para sus ingresos por remesas y ahorros. Y provocaría que las empresas corrieran hacia el dólar, ya que buscarían cambiar sus devaluados BTC por esta moneda. Ese fondo fiduciario de $150 millones se agotaría muy rápidamente.      Incluso sin una gran caída del BTC, el país podría quedarse sin dólares estadounidenses. Convertir a BTC los ingresos por remesas reduce, por desgracia, la entrada de dólares y, por tanto, aumenta el riesgo de escasez de dólares. Es fácil comprar bitcoin con dólares estadounidenses, pero no es tan fácil venderlo a cambio de dólares, especialmente cuando muchas otras personas están tratando de vender al mismo tiempo. Las stablecoins como USDT pueden ser una cobertura temporal contra la volatilidad del BTC, pero no son muy útiles para las empresas y los gobiernos que tienen deudas en dólares que deben ser atendidas.      Además, el resto del mundo podría no estar muy entusiasmado con la idea de prestar dólares a un país que ha diversificado sus reservas en BTC y se ha quedado sin dólares como resultado. El FMI, que actualmente está negociando con El Salvador un posible préstamo, ya ha expresado cierta preocupación.      También existe otro tipo de riesgo, que desgraciadamente ha tenido lugar con demasiada frecuencia en América Latina. Se trata del riesgo de que la rigidez monetaria causada por la escasez de dólares y la iliquidez del BTC resulte insoportable, y el gobierno comience a emitir su propia moneda, quizás en forma de una stablecoin. Inicialmente, podría estar totalmente respaldada por sus reservas de dólares y BTC en un acuerdo de junta monetaria —conocida en ingles como currency board— similar al de Hong Kong. Pero la volatilidad del BTC hace que esto sea enormemente problemático; incluso una pequeña caída de BTC dejaría a la moneda parcialmente sin respaldo.      Además, si el deseo del gobierno de repartir dinero supera a su capacidad productiva de generar dólares y BTC, la junta monetaria podría convertirse rápidamente en un acuerdo permanente de tipo de reserva fraccionaria. Esto dejaría a la nueva moneda totalmente expuesta a un ataque especulativo diseñado para drenar las reservas y forzarla a salir de su paridad.      Es esencial que el gobierno de El Salvador resista la tentación de optar por una mejora a corto plazo del crecimiento económico y el bienestar mediante la emisión de grandes cantidades de una nueva moneda fiduciaria o stablecoin sólo parcialmente respaldada por las reservas de divisas. Esa es la receta para una crisis de divisas, el default de la deuda y la hiperinflación. Demasiados países de América Latina han jugado a esto antes. Es un riesgo que El Salvador no debería correr.      Así que doy una bienvenida reservada al esquema de El Salvador. Podría funcionar, pero hay enormes riesgos y tentaciones. Y debe ir unido a esfuerzos serios para atraer inversiones y desarrollar industrias de exportación. Cambiar el régimen monetario está muy bien, pero al final lo que importa es la producción de bienes y servicios reales. De ahí viene la riqueza de las naciones.      Si este esquema funciona, obviamente es bueno para bitcoin, ya que lo establecería como moneda nacional y activo de reserva menor. Y, lo crean o no, espero que funcione. Me gustaría ver a El Salvador alcanzar la prosperidad; y si bitcoin puede ayudar a hacerlo, entonces ese es un gran uso de esta criptomoneda.      Para mí, eso es mucho más importante que los sueños de dominación mundial. Significaría que bitcoin está marcando una diferencia real en la vida de personas reales. Y eso es lo que realmente importa.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDT,"Frances Coppola, Andrés Engler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/19/por-que-bitcoin-podria-ser-algo-bueno-para-el-salvador,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5be844fe7e0f44c2be9c8908a5252b7e7f77e62-1400x934.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406978,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8l6n,1626730354,"En medio de la crisis sanitaria y el embargo económico, cubanos utilizan criptomonedas para ayudar a sus compatriotas","Los cubanos están recurriendo a las criptomonedas para hacer llegar donaciones a compatriotas que las necesitan.      Los residentes en Cuba comenzaron a protestar contra el gobierno a principios de este mes, señalando el embargo económico al país y el rápido empeoramiento de la crisis del COVID-19. Los casos casi se duplicaron el 9 de julio, con resultados positivos diarios que alcanzaron los 6.422 después de los 3.664 del día anterior. Matanzas, la provincia más afectada, registró la mitad de ellos.      En Twitter, los hashtags #SOSCuba y #SOSMatanzas se convirtieron en trending topic en diferentes partes del mundo.    Read this article in English.    Al ver lo que ocurría en Matanzas, la emprendedora cubana Thais Liset comenzó a pensar en ideas para ayudar a sus compatriotas en esa provincia y decidió que las donaciones serían la mejor opción para contrarrestar la falta de insumos médicos y alimentos.      Junto al YouTuber cubano Frank el Makina, Liset buscó la ayuda de Erich García Cruz, uno de los principales influencers cubanos de cripto, quien lidera los proyectos BitRemesas y QvaPay, dos emprendimientos enfocados en facilitar la entrada de remesas y el cobro en dólares para cubanos utilizando criptomonedas.    Tras la solicitud, García Cruz creó una cuenta especial dentro de QvaPay para recibir donaciones sin ninguna comisión. ""Todas las transacciones son públicashttps://qvapay.com/payme/sosmatanzas para que se pueda auditar todo lo que está pasando en tiempo real"", dijo García Cruz a CoinDesk.    La iniciativa busca principalmente recibir dinero de los cubanos en el extranjero. Las criptomonedas proporcionan la forma más fácil y rápida para que los individuos donen, dijo García Cruz, quien agregó que los cubanos en Cuba fueron los que más contribuyeron. El proyecto también incluyó donaciones en fiat por parte de cubanos que están en Cuba, aunque el número de remesas mediante criptomonedas fue superior, dijo.      Muchos cubanos que viven en el extranjero no tenían cuentas en exchanges de criptomonedas, dijo García Cruz. ""Son amigos que viven en el extranjero y no saben mucho sobre cómo operar con cripto, así que los guiamos paso a paso para que compraran en Binance o Coinbase"", agregó.      Según García Cruz, las transferencias al país en dólares están prohibidas ya que un embargo impuesto por la Oficina de Control de Activos Extranjeros de Estados Unidos castiga a los bancos que realizan esas operaciones.      Sin embargo, dijo que algunos bancos europeos no están alcanzados por la prohibición y que se crearon agencias privadas de remesas como VaCuba y FonMoney para eludir las sanciones estadounidenses.      FonMoney, por ejemplo, recibe transferencias de euros, libras esterlinas, pesos mexicanos, pesos chilenos y francos suizos. Luego ofrece la conversión de ese dinero a pesos cubanos o dólares estadounidenses y el posterior envío a cuentas en Cuba o tarjetas prepagas, según consiga en su sitio web.      Los cubanos, además, no tienen acceso a productos de Visa o Mastercard debido al embargo comercial de Estados Unidos que rige actualmente, mientras que Western Union, el mayor servicio de transferencia de dinero a nivel global, suspendió las transferencias en dólares estadounidenses a Cuba en noviembre tras la última sanción de la administración Trump.      Por otra parte, una caída en la industria del turismo causada por la pandemia afectó a los cubanos que tenían ingresos en dólares dentro de la isla.      En junio Cuba anunció que dejaría de aceptar temporalmente depósitos bancarios en efectivo en dólares, argumentando que las sanciones de Estados Unidos restringen su capacidad de utilizar esa moneda en el extranjero. Las transferencias bancarias seguirían estando disponibles, anunció el gobierno.    La iniciativa    Según García Cruz, hasta ahora se han recaudado $2.000, y las donaciones hechas mediante criptomonedas están destinadas principalmente a cubanos que no reciben ayuda de sus familiares en el extranjero.      Otra empresa de criptomonedas que se ha sumado a la iniciativa de donaciones es Slyk.      ""Puede ser utilizada en Cuba por personas que quieran recaudar donaciones con cualquier método de pago, desde Venmo hasta bitcoin"", dijo a CoinDesk Tim Parsa, CEO de Slyk.      Las donaciones se destinarán a la compra de medicamentos y mascarillas para ayudar a los cubanos de Matanzas y otras ciudades, agregó.      El community manager y representante de Slyk en Cuba es Camilo Noa, uno de las personas que ideó el proyecto de las donaciones.      ""Hasta ahora hemos comprado medicamentos, mascarillas, alcohol, gel de manos, cloro, alimentos, productos de higiene personal, ropa y otros insumos. Las donaciones han sido entregadas a la gente, hospitales y centros de aislamiento"", dijo a CoinDesk.      Según García Cruz, ningún sistema o institución está supervisando las entregas. ""Esto se trata de cubanos ayudando a cubanos, siendo solidarios y transparentes con quienes más lo necesitan"", dijo.      Liset ofrece actualizaciones en su cuenta de Twitter sobre las cantidades compradas, los precios y las personas a las que se les entregan las donaciones realizadas.      Después de que el gobierno comenzara a detener a manifestantes, las donaciones a Matanzas quedaron en suspenso, ya que la gente no quiere salir de sus casas, dijo Liset.      ""Todo iba bien. Con permisos especiales, nosotros mismos estábamos enviando medicinas, suministros médicos, alimentos"", dijo.      Las donaciones se destinan actualmente al personal sanitario y a los pacientes de la llamada Zona Roja Covid-19 de Matanzas. Sin embargo, eso podría cambiar en el futuro, ya que García Cruz no ha dejado de recibir solicitudes de diferentes provincias en los últimos días.      ""Otras provincias ya se están sumando a la iniciativa porque el caos es total y la necesidad de ayuda está en todas partes"", dijo García Cruz.      El Consejo para la Transición Democrática en Cuba, creado recientemente por opositores al gobierno local, emitió el sábado 10 de julio un comunicado sobre la crisis humanitaria en el que calificaba de ""caótica"" la situación sanitaria en Matanzas.      Según el medio opositor local 14ymedio, se registraron decenas de denuncias sobre el colapso del sistema sanitario, la muerte de pacientes en sus domicilios, la falta de medicamentos e insumos médicos, y la mala atención médica.      Como respuesta al papel de las redes sociales en las protestas, el régimen empezó a cortar el servicio de internet.      NetBlocks, un monitor global de Internet, publicó en su Twitter que las redes sociales y las plataformas de mensajería habían sido restringidas desde el proveedor estatal de Internet Etecsa.      Fuentes cubanas confirmaron a CoinDesk que hay cortes de Internet. En algunos casos, los entrevistados tardaron hasta un día en responder los mensajes de Telegram.      En este contexto, las transacciones de criptomonedas también se ven ""considerablemente afectadas"", dijo Noa.      Según se observa en el registro público de QvaPay, ha disminuido la cantidad de donaciones en la última semana. De acuerdo a García Cruz, esto está ocurriendo por los cortes de internet y porque, consecuentemente, mucha gente no puede utilizar sus billeteras.    Fuera del sistema    Según García Cruz, los criptoactivos más utilizados para las donaciones son bitcoin y USDT, aunque la plataforma también acepta litecoin, tron y bitcoin cash, entre otros.      Una vez recibidas las donaciones en criptomonedas, éstas se cambian en el mercado paralelo a fiat y luego el dinero es utilizado en las tiendas MLC —moneda libre convertible— donde se pueden adquirir productos solo con monedas extranjeras, añadió García Cruz.      Tras generar el enojo de una parte de la población, varias de estas tiendas fueron saqueadas recientemente.      En el último año el número de tiendas MLC se ha multiplicado en el país y ha concentrado la mayor parte de los alimentos y productos básicos. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los cubanos no tiene acceso a ellas porque no recibe salarios en dólares o euros.      El 1 de enero Cuba puso fin a su sistema de doble moneda, tras eliminar el peso convertible —cotizaba 1 a 1 con el dólar estadounidense— y dejar en circulación al peso cubano, tras una fuerte devaluación que lo llevó a cotizar a $0,042 en la actualidad.      Sin embargo, García Cruz dijo que la tasa de cambio en el mercado negro es más alta —de 60 pesos cubanos por dólar—, mientras que las criptomonedas se cambian a 50 pesos cubanos debido a un factor de oferta y demanda.      Noa dijo que la mayoría de los cubanos no utiliza criptomonedas y que quienes buscan ayuda priorizan obtener dinero en efectivo para comprar los alimentos y medicinas que necesitan. García Cruz, sin embargo, estima que existe una gran comunidad cripto, de aproximadamente 200.000 personas en Cuba.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LTC | BNB,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/19/en-medio-de-la-crisis-sanitaria-y-el-embargo-economico-cubanos-utilizan-criptomonedas-para-ayudar-a-sus-compatriotas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4798f1ba5d719541bac3d80741dc1181759e6170-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Al igual que la mayoría de las instituciones, el banco ha sido conservador en su acercamiento al sector de las criptomonedas, pero debido a la gran cantidad de margen requerido para negociar los futuros ahora está permitiendo que algunos clientes accedan a ese mercado, dijo una de las fuentes.

En mayo, CME lanzó sus productos de futuros ""Micro Bitcoin"" en un intento de capitalizar el repunte del precio de esa criptomoneda.      A principios de este año CME ocupó el primer puesto en la lista de las mayores plataformas de negociación de futuros de bitcoin, lo que indica un aumento continuo de la participación institucional.

According to a readout published by the U.S. Treasury Department, the highly anticipated meeting examined stablecoin growth, use cases and possible threats. The meeting was first announced on Friday, capping off a recent rise in attention on stablecoins and their role in the cryptocurrency economy.      ""The group also heard a presentation from Treasury staff on the preparation of a report on stablecoins, which would discuss their potential benefits and risks, the current U.S. regulatory framework, and the development of recommendations for addressing any regulatory gaps,"" the readout said.      Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairwoman Jelena McWilliams, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance J. Nellie Liang and Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles joined Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler and Acting Commodities Futures Trading Commission chief Rostin Behnam during the meeting.      The meeting came just days after Federal Reserve attorney Jeffery Zhang (writing in a personal capacity and not for the Fed) and Yale University economist Gary Gorton published a paper saying stablecoins could pose a systemic risk to the financial system.      The paper likened stablecoins to the wildcat banks of the 1800s, pointing to a lack of insurance, the risk of bank runs and the chances of a stablecoin losing its peg when a user tries to redeem or spend it.      It's unclear when specifically the Treasury Department intends to publish its recommendations, or whether it will focus more on congressional action or agency rulemaking.

42406989,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8lJa,1626727027,Market Wrap: Sentiment Away From Risk Sends Bitcoin Toward $30K,"Bitcoin traded lower on Monday, mirroring declines in traditional markets as investors pull away from risky assets because of concerns about weaker monetary and fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, including those caused by the Delta variant.      Bitcoin was trading at around $30,600 at press time and is down about 3% over the past 24 hours. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is up about 4% year to date, compared with a roughly 12% return for the S&P 500 Index.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $30755.8, -2.78%  Ether (ETH) $1825.6, -3.96%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4258.7, -1.58%  Gold: $1811, -0.05%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.2%, compared with 1.294% on Friday  Macro and regulatory headwinds    Regulatory scrutiny regarding stablecoins is also weighing on cryptocurrencies. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued a white paper on Friday outlining initial research for the nation’s digital currency project, which appears to challenge existing cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.      “Cryptocurrencies are mostly speculative instruments, and therefore pose potential risks to financial security and social stability,” the PBOC's white paper stated.      “Some commercial institutions even plan to launch global stablecoins, which will bring three risks and challenges to the international monetary system, payment and clearing system, monetary policies, cross-border capital flow management, etc.,"" the report said.      Another source of selling pressure across risk assets could be the reduction of government stimulus. “Too much stimulus breeds complacency,” MRB Partners wrote in a research note published on Friday.      MRB also noted widespread asset price inflation, which can lead to market imbalances similar to an episode in Japan in the 1980s that preceded a decade of low investment returns.    Bitcoin market parallels    The chart below shows bitcoin’s current range, which is similar to the sideways pattern of between $5,900 and $7,400 in 2018. The previous range, although more volatile than the current pattern, preceded a nearly 45% sell-off, which extended the bear market until prices recovered in mid-2019.      A decline was also seen in ether (ETH) below the $400 price level in 2018, similar to the drop to below $2,000 last week.    Bitcoin volatility trap    Bitcoin’s near-term volatility is starting to rise after declining from peak levels in June. Some analysts expect selling pressure could increase, causing bitcoin to break below $30,000 support.      “Front-end vols have been hit the hardest, creating a very steep volatility term structure,” QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram chat. “It makes sense to roll short July positions to September given the significant dip in front-end vols.”      ""Front-end vols"" refers to ""short-term volatility.""      “Bitcoin volatility has started to spike up and is trading close to 80% for July expiry,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “We can see sharp moves on the downside if BTC breaks below $30,000 convincingly.”      Balani also noted that options sellers have become more aggressive as bitcoin trades in a tight range. There has been more put writing at $30,000 and $32,000 strikes on the downside, he said.    Ethereum funds capture inflows    Digital-asset funds have attracted capital over the past two weeks, albeit at a slower pace as investors remain cautious after the crypto crash in May. It appears that investors are warming up to ether, which saw a third consecutive week of inflows, totaling $11.7 million, according to a report by CoinShares.    Stablecoin regulations    As the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets discusses stablecoins at a meeting today, debates about how stablecoins should be regulated heated up. CoinDesk Columnist JP Koning wrote that regulators may have contributed to the fast growth of stablecoin supply because of their failure to close the ""pseudonymity loophole"" in such financial products earlier.      In an academic paper titled “Taming Wildcat Stablecoins” released Saturday, Yale economist Gary Gorton and U.S. Federal Reserve attorney Jeffery Zhang said that without proper regulation, the world of stablecoins could evolve into one reminiscent of the 19th century’s free banking period in the U.S.      It is not the first time for the analogy to be used, and Nic Carter, another CoinDesk columnist explained why.

The document notes a July 14 statement by SEC commissioners Hester Peirce and Elad Roisman opposing the agency’s enforcement action against Blotics, the operator of the once-popular cryptocurrency website Coinschedule.      The lawyers representing Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen highlighted the commissioners’ criticism that the enforcement action against Coinschedule did not pinpoint which tokens the site promoted were securities, as well as wider uncertainty about how tokens are defined.      “The Public Statement confirms the Individual Defendants’ arguments that there was (and remains) significant regulatory uncertainty regarding when digital assets may be classified as securities by the SEC,” the Ripple lawyers wrote in their filing.    Read more: Ripple Waiting for SEC Suit Resolution Before Going Public, Says CEO    The lawyers added: “The SEC’s aiding and abetting claim requires that 'it show that the Individual Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that Ripple’s offerings and sales of XRP required registration as securities and that those transactions were improper.’”      The SEC alleged in December 2020 that Ripple had conducted an ongoing and unregistered securities sale via the XRP token closely associated with its brand.      The SEC alleged Coinschedule, which profiled initial coin offerings (ICOs) from 2016 to 2019, secretly received compensation from digital asset issuers it was profiling. Blotics agreed to a settlement that included a penalty of $153,434 and an agreement to stop violating the anti-touting provisions.      “There is a decided lack of clarity for market participants around the application of the securities laws to digital assets and their trading, as is evidenced by the requests each of us receives for clarity and the consistent outreach to the Commission staff for no-action and other relief,” Peirce and Roisman wrote following the settlement.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP | TOKEN SALE,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/19/ripple-cites-sec-commissioners-remarks-to-support-dismissal-of-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/323a90c78173b6a94961d7f9c2fc26375b6cc990-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406980,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8lBi,1626723066,How $33B Robinhood Ended Up Being Worth Less Than Coinbase,"Robinhood announced its plans for an initial public offering earlier this month, and today we got a rather surprising number for the expected IPO valuation: $33 billion. That’s shocking because it’s nearly 18% below the $40 billion valuation that the ultra-hot stock trading app had been expected to hit.      The declining number tells a profound story about the role of sentiment and mood in markets – what economist John Maynard Keynes in 1936 called “animal spirits.” Keynes’ invocation of something as woolly as the mood of the investing public ran directly counter to the concept of homo economicus that stood, then as now, at the center of the so-called classical economics that has dominated the discipline. This fictional human has complete access to market information and is able to make the objectively correct decision about the price of assets, not just based on present conditions but on likely future projections.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    The all-knowing homo economicus is in turn the core of Efficient Markets Theory, or EMT. EMT is the idea that the arbitrage opportunities presented by markets (especially equity markets) attract traders with unknown information to those markets. Those traders and their information, according to EMT, then help markets find the “correct” price for an asset.      But Robinhood’s stunted IPO encapsulates many of the shortcomings of EMT, and shows why economics as a discipline is broadly rethinking the theory. More than perhaps any other company, Robinhood has benefited immensely from the animal spirits unleashed by a coronavirus pandemic-driven 18 months of meme trading and stimulus-fueled speculation. And it now seems poised to taste the other edge of the blade as a falling short-term market damps enthusiasm for what should be a long-term bet.    Read more: Can Coinbase Keep Wall Street Happy During the Crypto ‘Pause’? | David Z. Morris    Compare, if you will, Robinhood’s $33 billion valuation to the $85.8 billion IPO valuation earned back in April by Coinbase. I’m not going to do a full rundown, but in terms of both their basic business models and their user numbers it’s truly nonsensical that Coinbase should be worth nearly three times Robinhood. To make just one comparison, Robinhood recently reported 22.5 million funded accounts and nearly 18 million monthly active users. Coinbase, in its first quarterly report as a public company, claimed 56 million accounts, but only 6.1 million active users. Robinhood also has a vastly stronger competitive moat than Coinbase, which is at severe risk of undercutting by competitors with lower trading fees. Those competitors include Robinhood itself, which currently offers trading of BTC, ETH, LTC and dogecoin, but could easily expand its offerings.      So given all that, how did Coinbase wind up with an IPO valuation nearly three times as high as Robinhood’s?    Beast wars    The simple answer is: IPO timing matters, even though the dominant way of viewing capital markets says it shouldn’t.      The facts fit together neatly. Coinbase IPO’d in the middle of a bull market for the crypto assets on which it’s focused. That timing helped it raise at a valuation nearly five times the $18.1 billion that one respected analyst found reasonable based on its fundamentals.      Robinhood, by contrast, is a stock-trading company poised to IPO just as an overheated stock market cools off. Just this morning we saw a chilling 3% sell-off in the Dow Jones industrials, partly over fears that the new Delta variant of COVID-19 is going to slow the worldwide economic recovery. That’s a six- to 12-month headwind at most, but it’s helping rob Robinhood of hundreds of millions of dollars in capital it likely could have raked in if the IPO took place four months ago.      That holds some important and maybe scary lessons for capital markets because timing the market for IPOs shouldn't really be a thing, according to Efficient Markets Theory. EMT says investors should be able to fully and accurately zero out the short-term state of the market and economy when making a long-run investment like an IPO. Translated into real terms, EMT would argue that investors in Coinbase in April should have been able to intuit the crypto market was about to top out, based on historical patterns that are widely established. But, of course, when you put it like that, the absurdity becomes obvious.      Now, in fairness, a more realistic interpretation of EMT takes into account a certain time lag as markets figure out what an asset is ""really"" worth – it doesn’t assume every investor is individually perfectly rational, but that the market converges towards rationality as information spreads. Since its IPO, Coinbase stock has dropped more than 30%, so maybe early buyers took a harder look at the numbers and changed their minds.    Read more: Inflation Is Rampant. Is It Time to Buy Bitcoin? | David Z. Morris    Just as important to that drop, though, has been the broader downshift in the crypto market, which is itself immensely speculative and therefore highly driven by sentiment. In other words, the drop itself is just as likely sentimental as some sort of acknowledgment of reality. And even after dropping 30% from its IPO, Coinbase is valued at $45 billion, still well over Robinhood’s IPO valuation. Timing and sentiment have trounced long-view market rationality.      This disconnect between the Coinbase and Robinhood IPOs is just one example of market irrationality, but there are now so many economics is consciously turning away from, or at least complicating, the ideas of efficient markets and homo economicus. That re-evaluation has progressed to the point where the top prize in economics, the Bank of Sweden Memorial Nobel, has been awarded twice in the past decade to scholars who have worked specifically to highlight problems with EMT and Economic Man.      In 2011, the Bank of Sweden prize went to Daniel Kahneman, whose work on humans’ “fast and slow” thinking systems provides a compelling way to understand that puzzling breed of impulsive, greedy, fearful trader who always manages to buy the top and sell the bottom. In 2013, the prize went to Robert Shiller, whose work on the economic impact of narratives is key to a modern understanding of financial bubbles and bull markets.      As the narrative of a never-ending bull market breaks down, both bodies of work are well worth reviewing. Robinhood, I’m sure, is wishing it had moved fast enough to harness the wild beasts of the market when they were stampeding in the right direction.

42406974,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8l4p,1626719903,"If Stablecoins Cause Instability, Regulators Have Themselves to Blame","With the stablecoin market rising to $100 billion last month, the debate over how to regulate these novel financial products is heating up.      Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that stablecoins are ""growing incredibly fast but without appropriate regulation."" This week, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, made up of top U.S. financial regulators, will discuss stablecoins.      Regulators worry that the stablecoin market's explosive growth is creating financial stability issues. That may be the case, but if so, it's the regulator's own fault.    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    A major driver behind stablecoins' popularity is their pseudonymity. Folks don't have to provide ID to use them. By failing to close this pseudonymity loophole early on, regulators themselves have sponsored the ""incredibly fast"" growth that they are now so worried about. If they continue to ignore the pseudonymity issue, their job will get only more complicated.    There are two types of stablecoin regulations    There are two types of financial regulations: anti-money laundering rules and financial stability rules.      Under the first, financial institutions like stablecoins are required to do due diligence on their customers to screen out bad actors. Stability encompasses concerns like, ""Does the stablecoin hold sufficiently safe assets to ensure that it is actually stable?""    Read more: Why Central Bankers Invoke Free Banking to Attack Stablecoins | Nic Carter    Heightened concerns over stablecoins relate to the second type of regulation, financial stability. ""We have a tradition in this country where the public’s money is held in what is supposed to be a very safe asset,"" Powell said last week, pointing to regulatory frameworks for bank deposits and money market funds. “That doesn’t exist for stablecoins.""      That lack of safety, combined with the market's ""incredibly fast"" growth, has the U.S.'s top dog banker spooked.    Digital dollar pseudonymity    Regulators fear this fast-growing segment of the financial industry. But the growth of stablecoins has been caused by the regulators themselves. More specifically, it is regulators' early failure to properly enunciate how anti-money laundering rules apply to stablecoins that has underpinned the market's incredible growth.      For several years now, stablecoins have been providing a financial service that is in high demand, but no other U.S. financial institution is allowed to provide: non-KYC'ed (know your customer) access to digital U.S. dollars.      You or I can hold $100,000 in a PayPal account or a bank like Wells Fargo, but only after having passed through these institutions' due diligence processes. That isn't the case with stablecoins, however. We can hold $100,000 worth of tether or USD Coin without having to provide any identifying information whatsoever to either Tether or Circle, the owners of those stablecoin platforms.      We can then send that $100,000 along to other users, who can transfer the stablecoins on, who in turn can transfer them on, and no one along this daisy chain needs to go through a know-your-customer process.      The only users who stablecoin issuers bother identifying are those who want to convert stablecoins back into actual dollars, or those who want to deposit dollars at the stablecoin issuer in return for stablecoins. But that constitutes a tiny minority of stablecoin users.      Given how anti-money laundering requirements have been getting more stringent for decades, it's mind-boggling that stablecoin issuers have been allowed to continue providing this level of pseudonymity. But not a single U.S. regulator has done anything to stop it.    Read more: Circle Isn’t Winning the Stablecoin Transparency Race | J.P. Koning    There have been hints about regulators' dissatisfaction with stablecoin pseudonymity. Last December, for instance, the President's Working Group (the same one that met this week) suggested that stablecoins should ""have the capability to obtain and verify the identity of all transacting parties, including for those using unhosted wallets.""      A hosted stablecoin wallet refers to one's balances of tether or USD Coin held on an exchange like Coinbase, which does KYC on all of its customers. An unhosted stablecoin wallet is when a user self-custodies their stablecoin balances. For the most part, stablecoins currently make no effort to identify un-hosted users.      Another indication about what U.S. regulators actually think about stablecoin pseudonymity emanates from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), one of America's top banking regulators. Last year, the OCC granted Federal banks the authority to support stablecoin transactions, but only if they involve hosted wallets. Because all the big stablecoin issuers allow oodles of un-hosted activity, OCC-regulated banks are probably off limits to them.      So the top dog regulators aren't fond of pseudonymity. Even then, the stablecoin platforms continue to offer it. Since the PWG's December meeting, the stablecoin market has grown by an astonishing $75 billion to $110 billion stablecoins in circulation, due in no small part to demand for digital dollar pseudonymity.    Who are the users of stablecoin pseudonymity?    Stablecoin pseudonymity is key to decentralized finance, or DeFi. DeFi tools are automated smart contracts running on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain or Tron that provide various financial services such as banking, lending or trading.      The financial services being offered on DeFi are strictly regulated in the U.S. But the operators of these decentralized tools have mostly avoided chartering or licensing, usually after appealing to their anonymity, automated nature and lack of centralization. And except for a few instances such as EtherDelta, a decentralized exchange, regulators haven't shut these tools down.      Gray market financial institutions would not normally be granted access to accounts at U.S. financial institutions. But the stablecoin pseudonymity loophole allows these DeFi tools to do just that – ingest huge amounts of safe digital dollars.      One of them, MakerDAO, held just over $350 million in USDC in December. It now holds almost $3.5 billion! Maker is just one of many pseudonymous users of stablecoins.      Stablecoin pseudonymity is also handy for outright unlawful activities. Ponzi schemes and high-yield income programs (HYIPs) would normally be prevented from accessing dollar payments. They are illegal, and so banks can’t serve them. But there are many instances of Ponzis and HYIPs using stablecoins for pay-ins and payouts, thanks to ""light touch"" stablecoin KYC.    Read more: Can Decentralized Stablecoins Stabilize? | J.P. Koning    If U.S. regulators had from the get-go required stablecoins to do KYC on all their users, then gray market DeFi tools would not be able to access stablecoins, nor would Ponzis and HYIP operators. DeFi would be much smaller than it is now. And stablecoins would never have grown to become a $110 billion market.      But regulators let pseudonymity continue, and so stablecoins got big. And now these regulators find themselves in a mess of their own making. With the market becoming significant, they now find themselves worrying about matters like systemic risk, financial interdependencies and cascading failures.    A modicum of regulation    Powell isn't happy with the state of stablecoin regulators, but it's worth keeping in mind that the U.S. issuers of stablecoins already operate under a financial regulatory framework.      The New York Department of Financial Services, or NYDFS, has authorized state trust companies to issue stablecoins. Three stablecoins – Gemini Dollar, Paxos Standard and BUSD – already operate under the NYDFS's regulatory framework. Circle, the issuer of the USD Coin stablecoin, has taken a different pathway toward regulation. It has secured 44 state money transmitter licenses. This is the same regulatory route taken by PayPal and Western Union.      As long as stablecoins remained small, these niche regulatory frameworks were probably sufficient for guaranteeing stablecoin financial safety. But Tether and USDC are now bigger than many U.S. banks and money market mutual funds, which are required to abide by stricter rules than money transmitters.      Complicating matters is that the DeFi entire ecosystem has grown up around the assumption of pseudonymous stablecoin access. By removing pseudonymity this late into the game rather than at the outset, regulators will be imposing big changes on these decentralized tools.      Regulators are late and have a lot of catching up to do. They are worried about financial stability issues surrounding stablecoins, but figuring out the pseudonymity loophole will be a big part of their task. I don’t envy them.",NEUTRAL,USDC,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDC,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/19/if-stablecoins-cause-instability-regulators-have-themselves-to-blame,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/179a590b0ad22a3e47f99998b078b6bf9449cbb8-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387265,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmKbL,1626715911,"Everything Moves Fast in DeFi, Even Political Action","In a few years' time, the crypto world is going to look back on the DeFi Education Fund as money well spent.      Last week, controversy broke out when the new advocacy group sold about $10 million in UNI tokens for USDC so that it would have ready cash to get off the ground. The news was cast in a particularly bad light when one member of the organization's new governing committee made a sale of UNI right around the same time the trade was going through.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    I have it on pretty good authority that while it might be bad optically (it definitely was bad optically), it was a harmless trade. Time will tell, I suppose, but even if it was a malicious trade, that doesn't mean the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) isn't a good idea at its core.      The Defiant did a solid job reporting on why people felt weird about this vote. Uniswap governance, it should be noted, makes it particularly hard to get anything passed. This was only the fifth measure to rally enough tokens for a final vote and just the third successful measure since Uniswap introduced decentralized governance in September.      The proposal to create DEF passed largely with the support of very big UNI holders, deep-pocketed investors. It didn't feel grassroots.      But let's be honest about the core reason folks hated this grant: No one likes a big sale on a token they are holding. Investors in crypto have an especially short-term view of their favorite assets, probably because news and trades have a way of hitting their charts so fast and hard. Big sales are betrayals.      And the asset price was down 25% from the start of the week on Friday, but still up 100% from the start of the year. I know it hurt. No one likes a pinch in the smart wallet, but the objections are, in my mind, a bit myopic.      Decentralized finance is an industry that threatens the massive money spigots that run the whole world. Its potential to shake up how value moves globally is too big; folks can only guess at how far it might go, even its builders.      This is becoming disconcerting to the powers that be. They aren't going to bother with learning how blockchains work to try to build competing technologies. No, the powers that be, both the state and the financial industry, will use the levers of power they know well: the law and regulations. And, of course, the law is built upon the state's martial power.    Read more: The Case for Collaborating on Crypto Regulations | Delphine Forma    It surprised me to see there was a group in DeFi prescient enough to get an organization like DEF funded now (nearly as surprised as I was to learn it was getting $20 million out of the gate, but that's a separate question). I wouldn't have expected folks in DeFi to get serious about politics nearly this soon. After all, Silicon Valley sat on its hands for years before finally going big making their case inside capitol buildings.      But everything in crypto really does move faster than you expect.      Founding a fund to defend DeFi was the right move. I know that big sale felt like a blow to the UNI hodlers, but your bags will be better off over time if someone is making the case for this technology with lawmakers.",NEUTRAL,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING | UNI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/19/everything-moves-fast-in-defi-even-political-action,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb82238e0bd8b3af05fe8690a5129db792a1a42f-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387266,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmKcb,1626710004,Why Central Bankers Invoke Free Banking to Attack Stablecoins,"If you pay attention to central bank agitprop, you may have noticed an interesting trend: Central bankers are increasingly fond of making references to monetary history, specifically the pre-Civil War period in the U.S. That was when the U.S. entered a monetary era known as “free banking.”      As it’s characterized today, this was a rollicking time, rife with bank failures and monetary instability, in which banknotes traded at a discount to par reflecting the creditworthiness of the bank. As the central bankers tell it, if you were to take a Tennessee banknote to New York, for instance, your money might not have been accepted at par. From the 1830s to the 1860s, the vast majority of banknotes were issued privately, by banks mostly regulated by individual states.    CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.    Our monetary elite has become fixated on this period recently. In May, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard denounced antebellum banking in a speech exploring the creation of central bank digital currencies (CBDC): ""Indeed, the period in the nineteenth century when there was active competition among issuers of private paper banknotes in the United States is now notorious for inefficiency, fraud, and instability in the payments system. It led to the need for a uniform form of money backed by the national government.""      Back in 2018, the president of the St. Louis Fed, James Bullard, also issued his own history-inspired critique of cryptocurrency, saying “cryptocurrencies are creating drift toward a non-uniform currency in the U.S., a state of affairs that has existed historically but was disliked and eventually replaced.”      In a hearing on digital currency last month, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren repeated similar talking points, comparing stablecoins to “wildcat notes from the 19th century.”      And just last weekend, Jeffery Zhang, an attorney at the Federal Reserve, and Gary Gorton, a professor at Yale, published a paper entitled “Taming Wildcat Stablecoins” in which they pejoratively compare stablecoins today to the banking context in the 19th century, which they refer to as “free banking.” The paper concludes that privately issued money (whether free banking or stablecoin-based) cannot work, and that only a sovereign can supply good money. The paper was commended by none other than the high prince of fiat, Paul Krugman, who used it as an opportunity to condemn stablecoins.      In all these cases, attacks on free banking – the notion of permitting banks to operate largely outside the confines of state regulation – are rhetorically employed to undermine stablecoins.      Stablecoins come in many forms but primarily exist as tokenized IOUs for commercial bank dollars that circulate on public blockchains, allowing settlement in dollars (or other sovereign currency terms). They trade at par because they are convertible for underlying dollars in commercial banks – or sold to someone who is willing to undertake that conversion. Because stablecoins trade on public blockchains and facilitate the global exchange of value across a network of exchanges and wallets, and issuers for the most part aren’t regulated as banks, these comparisons to laissez-faire banking naturally emerge.      So do stablecoins constitute a reprisal of free banking, and if so, is this a problem? On the first question, I would answer in the affirmative. Free banks relied on gold as reserves, whereas stablecoins are mostly issued against commercial bank dollars. Larry White points out other things where there are no analogies in terms of the liabilities between notes issued by free banks and the stablecoins of today. But by and large, the comparisons are quite apt.    Read more: Stablecoins Risky Like ‘Wildcat’ Bank Practices of 19th Century, Gorton and Zhang Write    So much so that we wrote a white paper in summer 2020 pointing out that stablecoins and their issuers (oftentimes exchanges) represent a potential technologically enabled return to a free banking era. As we say in the piece, “lessons can be taken from the history of prior banking epochs when private entities took responsibility for issuing money, effectively outside of state control.” So on this point, we very much agree with the comparison between free banks and stablecoins proffered by Brainard, Zhang and Gorton.      However, their emphasis solely on the U.S. instance of free banking is wrongheaded. As economists George Selgin and Larry White have spent virtually their entire careers pointing out, and we echo in our crypto-dollar piece, the American antebellum episode did not constitute genuine laissez-faire banking. Banks during that period were forced to hold risky state government bonds and were restricted from engaging in “branching” – meaning they couldn’t establish branches nationwide. This inhibited them from geographically diversifying their depositor base and from having free choice in their asset portfolio. It’s no wonder that bank failures were common.      Neither of these peculiarly U.S.-based restrictions was present in genuine free banking episodes such as Canada. There’s also Scotland’s successful case study, chronicled by the aforementioned Selgin and White, alongside Kroszner and Dowd. The repeated omission of successful historical instances of free banking – Scotland, Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland – in which bank failures were uncommon, notes were mutually accepted by rival banks and traded at par, appears strategic. For analyses that do consider the fuller historical record, see Selgin and White’s comparisons of free banking and contemporary stablecoins.    Unfortunately for them, not only is their historical account flawed, but so is their present-day assessment of stablecoins.    So why are the central bankers so keen to characterize the private issuance of money as inherently unstable?      Because they are deeply conflicted: They rely on these myths to sell us their proposed solution in the form of CBDCs. It’s no coincidence the anti-stablecoin contingent is generally fond of CBDCs and believes the state should not only control the issuance of money but also have the power to determine which transactions are valid.      We do not have to speculate on this front: If you listen to central bankers, they invariably de-emphasize privacy in transactions and mention the necessary imposition of controls inhibiting activities that the government claims are illicit. This is sometimes euphemized as “balanc[ing] an individual’s right to privacy with the public’s interest in the enforcement of AML/CFT regulations” – despite the fact that physical cash has no inbuilt anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism controls. I have yet to come across a central banker proposing a CBDC project with the precise and same qualities of privacy and transactional freedom as physical cash.      The debate is fundamentally about the state’s role in society. CBDCs promise to strip some of the issuing power of money away from the commercial bank sector (which exists as a public-private partnership) and restore it to the central government. This would naturally grant governments extremely powerful tools for surveillance, societal control and would empower central bankers with granular tools to affect the money supply. In a country where the politicization of banking is an established doctrine, CBDCs would represent a colossal victory for those trying to concentrate power in state hands.      Thus, the reason historical episodes with private monetary issuance and administration are so frequently a target is because they stand in the way of attacks on stablecoins. The success of stablecoins, and the attendant stagnation of CBDC projects, is embarrassing to central bankers and policymakers. Stablecoins offer everything that CBDCs hope to achieve, but in a completely bottom-up, free-market way.      If economists can prove that episodes of free and unrestricted banking were failures and led to massive consumer losses, they might prove that similar, latter-day systems are a bad idea, too. Unfortunately for them, not only is their historical account flawed, but so is their present-day assessment of stablecoins.      Far from being inherently flawed or unstable, stablecoins are an overwhelming success today. The free market has allocated over $110 billion in deposits to these projects, even though they have only really existed in production for seven years or so. Stablecoins collectively today settle anywhere between $10 and $20 billion on a given day – trading with extremely tight spreads.      Gorton and Zhang object that stablecoin recipients will not accept these tokens at par, because the “no questions asked” (NQA) principle is violated due to a lack of confidence in the issuer and no government backing. “Without NQA,” they insist, “the community had no money. Stablecoins that do not satisfy this principle also will not be able to serve as money in transactions.” But their analysis is off base both historically and in the present day. Private banknotes worked just fine – in Scotland, between 1716 and 1844. Today, stablecoins have been embraced and indeed accepted at par by millions of individuals and firms, thanks to the presence of convertibility.    Read more: Money Reimagined: United States of Stablecoin | Michael Casey    Indeed, our venture fund – alongside many of our industry colleagues – today prefers to settle investments in stablecoin format because they operate 24/7, offer strong finality and do not face the massive headaches involved with sending wires abroad. Startups we invest in increasingly ask for them – and in some cases process payroll in stablecoin format. For globally distributed teams, stablecoins make far more sense than trying to tackle transfers to dozens of different countries via extractive intermediaries and the byzantine correspondent banking system.      On this topic the free market has already outmatched central banks. Encouragingly, some central bankers, like Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles, have understood the merits of stablecoins and have not dismissed them out of hand. Nevertheless, it is clear now that nothing in money or finance is deemed outside the purview of Washington and the New York Fed. The key question is, once they get ahold of them and regulate them “appropriately,” how will they do?      As for the consumer benefit of private versus public money, one only has to consider what happened after the free banking episode in the U.S. Monetary issuance was centralized in the hands of the state, which promptly inflated away everyone’s savings during the Civil War. Curiously, the central bankers touting the benefits of public money omit that part of the story.

42387269,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmKgN,1626702080,Bitcoin Drops as Investors Buy $22K and $20K Puts,"Bitcoin is falling a day after the options market saw increased demand for out-of-the-money or lower strike put options at $22,000 and $20,000.      The leading cryptocurrency was trading at a three-week low of $30,700 at press time, representing a 3.5% drop on the day. The decline has flipped the crucial 50-week simple moving average (SMA) support of $32,250 into resistance.      On Sunday, 500 contracts of the $22,000 put option expiring on Dec. 31 changed hands via the institution-focused over-the-counter (OTC) desk Paradigm. Similar volume crossed the tape for the $20,000 put expiring on Dec. 31.      ""There was interest to buy BTC puts for December in a significant size,"" Darius Sit, CEO of the Singapore-based QCP Capital, said. ""We made the market for most of the large block trades over the weekend. There was decent interest to sell September BTC puts as well.”      Market makers are always on the opposite side of traders/investors and run a direction-neutral portfolio. That essentially means buyers of the $20,000 and $22,000 puts expiring on Dec. 31 were investors, most likely adding downside hedges against long positions in the spot/futures market.      A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the underlying asset, in this case, bitcoin.      Overall, the options market is still biased bullish for the long term. The six-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts relative to calls, remains entrenched below zero. In plain English, longer duration calls or bullish bets are priced higher than puts.      However, the one-week, one-month and three-month put-call skews are indicating a negative bias with bearish prints.

The companies, both subsidiaries of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group (DCG), wrote in a joint press release the Grayscale DeFi Fund provides “exposure to a selection of industry-leading DeFi protocols through a market-capitalization weighted portfolio.” The idea is that investors can allocate money toward DeFi without having to buy the tokens directly.      DeFi, which consists of blockchain-based software protocols designed for the trading and lending of cryptocurrencies, is one of the fastest-growing segments of the digital-asset industry. The amount of collateral locked into the protocols has increased 19-fold over the past year to about $50 billion, and prices for many of the platforms’ associated tokens have soared.      ""Based on the user adoption that we're seeing around DeFi and DeFi protocols, we do think the future of this area is bright,"" Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an interview Monday on CoinDesk TV's First Mover program.      The fund is only open to “eligible individual and institutional accredited investors,” according to the press release. Grayscale said it “intends to attempt to have shares of this new product quoted on a secondary market” but added that “there is no guarantee this will be successful.”      The CoinDesk DeFi Index is a new product from TradeBlock, one of the first firms to develop an index for professional investors to track bitcoin when it launched the XBX Index in 2014. CoinDesk announced its purchase of TradeBlock for an undisclosed sum in January.      The new index joins a growing list of offerings designed to help investors track prices for DeFi tokens and invest in them. Last month, the technology firm Amun launched two new crypto token products, the DeFi Index Token and DeFi Momentum Index.      The cryptocurrency data firm Messari has a dedicated screening tool tracking 164 DeFi tokens. The average price of the tokens is up 395% this year, versus 8.3% for bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, and 160% for No. 2 ether.      According to the press release, the CoinDesk DeFi index aims to provide a “broad-based, benchmark representation of DeFi protocols,” with assets weighted by their market capitalization.      As of July 1, 2021, the CoinDesk DeFi Index consisted of the following assets, with their market-capitalization-based weightings:    Uniswap (UNI), 49.95%  Aave (AAVE), 10.25%  Compound (COMP), 8.38%  Curve (CRV), 7.44%  MakerDAO (MKR), 6.49%  SushiSwap (SUSHI), 4.83%  Synthetix (SNX), 4.43%  Yearn Finance (YFI), 3.31%  UMA Protocol (UMA), 2.93%  Bancor Network Token (BNT), 2.00%    UPDATE (13:19 UTC): This story has been updated to include a comment from Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein.",POSITIVE,YFI,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | YFI,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/19/grayscale-unveils-defi-fund-linked-to-new-coindesk-index,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56a86ad0bf4b77b5d7e57d9569f9ffc028dd59bc-1300x977.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387271,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmKhd,1626692484,Bitcoin Network Sees Fourth Straight Downward Difficulty Adjustment,"Bitcoin's mining difficulty, a metric indicating the effort required to solve the complex cryptographic puzzle to mine blocks and validate transactions, recorded its fourth straight drop over the weekend.      On Sunday, difficulty fell by 4.8% at block 691,488, having declined by a record 28% on July 3, according to data tracked by BTC.com. The difficulty rate now stands at an 18-month low of 13.67 trillion. That's down 45% from the mid-May peak of 25.05 trillion.      According to The Block, the network last recorded four consecutive declines in difficulty in 2011.      The bitcoin mining difficulty undergoes automatic adjustment every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks, to maintain a target block time of 10 minutes. The reward for mining blocks and approving transactions is currently 6.25 BTC.      The time taken to mine new blocks rises when there is a drop in the amount of computing power applied to the blockchain. At that point, the programmed code kicks pushes the difficulty lower to attract more miners and restore the average block time to 10 minutes.      ""Since May, the blockchain has been running slowly. Earlier this month, the average block time reached 1,000 seconds, when they ought to average around 600 seconds."" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, said.      ""To rectify that, the blockchain needed to speed up and make mining easier. The last four adjustments have been downward, and it now looks like the blockchain is back to normal,"" Morris said.      The self-adjusting mechanism makes bitcoin mining somewhat analogous to perfect competition, a hypothetical market structure where forces of demand and supply interact freely and firms' decisions are predictable.      The difficulty rate peaked at over 25 trillion in the second half of May and has been falling ever since amid China's crackdown on cryptocurrency mining. The mean hashrate peaked along with the price in mid-April and hit a two-year low of 61.22 exahashes per second (EH/s) in late June. Since then, it has recovered slightly to 96 EH/s, according to Glassnode data.      The dramatic decline in both the hashrate and difficulty could be a short-term phenomenon, as there is evidence that China-based miners shifting to the U.S. and Kazakhstan could soon become operational.      ""This is a one-off event, meaning most of this mining power will return, and before you know it, MORE than 900 coins per day will be mined since the hash rate will hit the network after the difficulty of each block decreases,"" Ben Lilly, a crypto economist at Jarvis Labs, noted in a Substack post published last month.      Also read: Bitcoin’s ‘Puell Multiple’ Flashes Misleading Bullish Signal as China Bans Mining      The drop in the mining difficulty has not had any bearish effect on the cryptocurrency's price, leaving it directionless in existing ranges.

The Russian Association of Cryptoeconomics, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain (RACIB) is working with federal and regional authorities as well as state-owned enterprises to determine how to bring mining to the country, the association said in a press release Monday.      RACIB has already formed several working groups with state-owned enterprises and companies in the energy sector, the statement said.      A group of Chinese mining companies representing 25% of the global bitcoin hashrate is also working with RACIB, the association said.      Miners from China, which until spring of this year accounted for about half the world's bitcoin hashrate, are migrating overseas following a government crackdown on the industry.      Many have flocked to Russia's neighboring Kazakhstan, which has surpassed Russia in terms of share of the global hashrate, according to Cambridge University's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.      Local governments in China appear to be concerned about the environmental impact of crypto mining.

Research by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic published Monday examines the case of a small business being contacted by REvil ransomware attackers demanding $50,000 in monero for a decryption tool.      In the ensuing dialogue on a ""victim portal"" reminiscent of live chat support on an IT help website:    The victim stated that $50,000 was too steep and asked for a reduction, to which the attacked replied ""My boss can offer 20% discount.""  Rather than paying in the anonymity-focused crypto monero, the victim asked to pay in bitcoin as it was easier to obtain. The attacker accepted the request, albeit with a 10% surcharge, reflecting the increased traceability of bitcoin.  The victim asked for reassurance that the attacker could perform the decryption by requesting a demonstration with two of the affected files, which the attacker appeared to oblige.  The attacker rejected a request to cut the payment to $10,000 or $20,000, finally agreeing to ""25K and okay not lower.""    Elliptic's research then shows the steps REvil took to launder the bitcoin received, splitting it into different streams, transferring it to different wallets and combining it with bitcoins from other sources. The analytics firms said it was able to make the information available to law-enforcement bodies, crypto exchanges and financial institutions to identify coins and wallets associated with cybercrime to take appropriate steps in preventing the criminals from being able to cash-out.      ""This laundering process in this case is still ongoing, but nevertheless we can already trace some of the funds to exchanges,"" the report said. ""Those exchanges will have information on the identities of people whose accounts received the funds – providing strong leads for law enforcement.""

Judith Fox, CEO of the Stockbrokers and Financial Advisers Association said costs to the group's members were rising as a result of an upgrade to the Australian Securities Exchange's (ASX) aging CHESS system.  “Many of our members are spending millions of dollars in order to be able to interact with the new distributed ledger technology that the ASX is implementing,” Fox said.  Fox was speaking during the country's Senate economics legislation committee, the Australian Financial Review reported Sunday.  An overhaul of the outdated 25-year-old Clearing House Electronic Subregister System, or CHESS, is being replaced by a blockchain-like iteration designed to speed up clearing and settlement.  Fox argues members, who aren't only in the business of providing industry advice, are connected in some way to the ASX and ""other global exchanges.""  “The investment required to operate in global markets is getting more and more intense,” said Fox as cited in the report.  A spokesperson for the ASX, who was present at the committee, said upgrading would entail some costs and that those costs would need to be determined by customers.  “Customers have choice about how they wish to interact with the new CHESS system,"" the spokesperson said.

Yale economist Gary Gorton and U.S. Federal Reserve attorney Jeffery Zhang said there existed systemic risk to the financial system by a ""digital form of privately produced money"" pegged one-to-one with ""safe"" assets.      In an academic paper titled ""Taming Wildcat Stablecoins"" released Saturday, the pair describe similarities they see in stablecoins with that of privately issued ""wildcat"" bank money in the past.      Gorton and Zhang liken stablecoins to a time in U.S. history when private banks issued their own notes in order to meet growing consumer demand, making it harder to transact as a result of fluctuating prices.      Private banknotes were also uninsured. The threat to the financial system posed by bank runs was very real, and at times, devastating. Privately produced monies, they argue, are not an effective medium of exchange because they are not always accepted at face value and are subject to bank runs.      ""If policymakers wait a decade, stablecoin issuers will become the money market funds of the 21st century – too big to fail – and the government will have to step in with a rescue package whenever there's a financial panic,"" the paper reads.    Read more: El Salvador May Issue Its Own Stablecoin: Report    Additionally, preserving the monetary sovereignty of the government is critical for establishing monetary policy, they wrote. ""Policymakers should learn from history and not make the same mistakes again.""      Therefore, regulating stablecoin issuers as banks and issuing a central bank digital currency, so as to have one uniform currency, is the way forward to combating those risks, the authors said.      Yet, George Selgin, Senior Fellow and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said Gorton and Zhang's view is misleading.      Selgin argues the sovereignty demands of the state exceeded that of the consumer's and was critical in establishing a financial monopoly by the banks and those that manage them.      ""Even the decision to establish a uniform U.S. currency during the Civil War also had nothing to do with consumers' preferences: if it had, there'd have been no need to a punitive 10% tax to force state banks to quit issuing their own notes.""",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/19/stablecoins-risky-like-wildcat-bank-practices-of-19th-century-gorton-and-zhang-write,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4896b1f4c8b8951ababfec9ca07f6b37404782a9-1400x930.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
