S&P said that bitcoin adoption could deter El Salvador from participating in an International Monetary Fund support program, increase financial weaknesses and impair banks by generating currency mismatches when they look to loan money, Reuters said.  “The risks” of El Salvador’s bitcoin adoption “seem to outweigh its potential benefits,” S&P said, according to the report. “There are immediate negative implications for (the) credit.”  The agency has given El Salvador a B- rating and a “stable” outlook.  Bitcoin became legal tender in El Salvador on Sept. 7 to great fanfare, but it has spurred protests among critics who say the law is not constitutional. The law was passed by a supermajority in El Salvador’s legislature on June 9.  In July, the ratings agency Moody’s downgraded El Salvador’s long-term, foreign-currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings from B3 to Caa1 and maintained a negative view of the country’s economy partly because of the government’s passage of the bitcoin law.  In a Thursday tweet, Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong noted that “crypto does not account for the majority of transactions in El Salvador yet” but called the country’s bitcoin adoption “steps in the right direction.”  UPDATE (Sept. 17, 03:59 UTC): Adds information about Brian Armstrong tweet.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/16/el-salvador-bitcoin-adoption-possesses-immediate-negative-implications-credit-rating-agency-says-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd36e6e6238905a70b2d4d023a7a933c2fa64adf-1024x684.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Avalanche Foundation said in a statement it will use the funds “to support and accelerate the rapid growth of DeFi, enterprise applications and other use cases on the Avalanche public blockchain.” Traders have plopped $2.6 billion onto Avalanche, according to data from Defi Llama, making it the sixth-largest network by total value locked (TVL).  The funding round was led by Three Arrows Capital and Polychain Capital, with participation from CMS Holdings and Dragonfly Capital, among others.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Avalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer said that a portion of the funds will be used to inject liquidity directly into Avalanche-based DeFi platforms.  “To make anything at Avalanche scale, you need large-scale capital. To provide a DEX [decentralized exchange] that operates efficiently, to provide liquidity pools that provide operations with low fees, low overhead, you often need access to large amounts of capital,” Gün Sirer said during a video call, adding:  “It is suboptimal to raise that with tiny amounts of checks. At some point you want the big liquidity to come in.”  Large-scale liquidity is a clear focus for the young chain. Two weeks ago the Avalanche Foundation announced a $180 million “Avalanche Rush” incentive program. Currently, those funds are primarily being used to incentivize user deposits.  Gün Sirer said the raise and the liquidity provision plans “will be something in conjunction with, but distinct from [Avalanche Rush].”  Read more: Can Avalanche Keep It Up? DeFi Users Rush In as Incentives Roll Out  Additionally, Gün Sirer told CoinDesk that the venture capital organizations that participated in the raise were chosen in part because of their expertise in DeFi markets and market-making.  “This was a case of us going to people in the space who we’ve admired for a long time, who have long track records, and who want to come into Avalanche and help boost this ecosystem,” he said.  Avalanche will be releasing more specifics of how the funds will be used in the coming weeks, and Gün Sirer said he anticipates a “busy fall” as protocols and organizations announce deployments to the chain.  AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain, jumped on the news, climbing from $59.19 shortly before this piece went out to $65.08 as of 15:37 UTC, according to CoinGecko.

42422148,pwSSwvY9oXIAw80qplcX5e,1631828243,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Drifts Lower as Altcoins Outperform,"Bitcoin dipped below $48,000 on Thursday as short-term overbought signals appeared on the charts. Buyers appear to be taking a breather ahead of the $50,000 resistance level, and some analysts expect the price to consolidate before the next option expiration date on Sept. 24.  Blockchain data shows large transaction volume in bitcoin, which suggests buyers could remain active at lower support levels. Bitcoin was trading at around $47,000 at press time and is up about 2% over the past week.  The rally in alternative cryptocurrencies continues to overshadow bitcoin, as seen especially in Avalanche’s AVAX token, which was up about 20% over the past 24 hours. The Avalanche Foundation announced on Thursday $230 million in funding to jumpstart liquidity in the network’s burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which contributed to the token’s price rally.  “It’s definitely altcoin season,” said Martha Reyes-Hulme, head of research at crypto trading platform BeQuant, in an interview with CoinDesk.  “BTC dominance (BTC market cap relative to the total cryptocurrency market cap) could easily pick up again, but certainly DeFi could continue – we see it on the front line in terms of client interest,” she said.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC), $47,493, -1.4%  Ether (ETH), $3,572, +0.2%  S&P 500: -0.2%  Gold: $1,755, -2.2%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.336%  “Bitcoin’s implied volatility selling off as range bound trading continues and the market heads into quarterly expiry next week,” tweeted options data provider Skew.  In a Telegram chat, QCP Capital, a crypto trading firm, noted the possibility of higher volatility heading toward the end of the month with bitcoin’s end-of-the-month expiry next week and macro uncertainty in the fourth quarter. The firm is planning to take profits on its short volatility positions.  Macro shuffle: Inflation cools as bitcoin recovers  Analysts are also monitoring inflation, which could encourage tighter monetary policy lead to a pullback in assets deemed to be risky, including cryptocurrencies.  On Tuesday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose less than expected in August, somewhat confirming the Federal Reserve’s view that rising prices are transitory because they are being compared with a low base from last year when the pandemic started. Equities pulled back following the CPI report, although the S&P 500 is roughly flat over the past five days, similar to bitcoin.  Some investors view bitcoin as a hedge against rising inflation due to its limited supply.  “Although the CPI release triggered a round of new narratives that we’ve potentially seen the peak for inflation, another rise in commodity prices yesterday suggested we aren’t out of the woods yet,” Deutsche Bank wrote in a Wednesday newsletter.  And rising inflation is not just a U.S. problem. “An area of particular interest that has the potential to create major concerns has been a big rise in European gas prices, bringing their gains since the start of August to +63.8%, and up by an astonishing +514% relative to a year ago,” Deutsche Bank wrote.  Gold, which is also viewed as an inflation hedge, is down about 7% year to date compared with a 63% rise in bitcoin over the same period. The chart below shows a declining correlation between bitcoin and gold, while the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 has risen over the past few months.  “Crypto tends to lead other asset classes; it’s a risk asset, although further out the risk curve than say emerging market equities,” Reyes-Hulme said.  Large bitcoin transaction volume  According to data tracked by analytics firm IntoTheBlock, aggregated daily volume measured in U.S. dollars from on-chain transactions, where each transaction was greater than $100,000, surged to a record $480 billion on Wednesday. In bitcoin terms, the so-called large transaction volume hit a two-year high of more than 10 million BTC.  Meanwhile, data shared by Santiment shows the supply held by millionaires list or addresses owning 10,000 to 100,000 coins has gone up 60,000 BTC in the past three days alone. Lucas Outumoru, head of research at IntoTheBlock, also confirmed a pickup in demand among large investors, saying “addresses with over 1,000 BTC are accumulating.”  With strong hands backing the recent rise above the 200-day moving average at $46,000, the path of least resistance appears to be on the higher side, reports CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.  Altcoin roundup  Solana network outage may be due to flawed design, says Huobi programming head: Andrew Zhang, head of Huobi Eco Chain’s Star Lab, said that the network’s outage on Tuesday was due to “excessive node memory consumption,” which “caused a chain reaction.” Zhang mentioned that the fundamental problem couldn’t be solved by simply restarting the network, and instead, pointed to deeper flaws with the blockchain’s design. In a statement to CoinDesk, Zhang also said Solana “still needs to solve some tricky follow-up issues” that surfaced after the outage.  Cardano approximately 20% off all-time highs despite smart-contract launch: Cardano’s ADA token ended the day below its early September highs, even though the network completed its highly anticipated smart contract launch earlier this week. According to crypto research firm 21Shares, Cardano “faces some technical issues and misunderstandings from the community on the fundamental front with its accounting model.”  Hedera Governing Council earmarked $5 billion in HBAR tokens to boost network adoption: Hedera Hashgraph, a blockchain alternative governed by the council, says about half of the tokens will be allocated to the newly established HBAR Foundation. The other $2.5 billion will go to initiatives aimed at strengthening the development of the Hedera ecosystem, reported CoinDesk’s Omar Godbole. The HBAR token has gained 100% during the month.

42376286,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4L3,1631826352,Bitcoin in El Salvador: Why Is It Worth the Effort?,"More than nine years ago, we founded Bitcoin Argentina’s nongovernmental organization to defend bitcoin and its potential despite all public opinion to the contrary. At the time, bitcoin was criticized by families and friends, very little was known about the subject, and everything in the media was negative. No one could understand the social relevance of defending a currency through an organization like ours.  Since then, our belief about the role that the currency as a store of value and its underlying technology would play in the near future became a reality, and all those who invested time to understand and listen saw the reward of their investment. In turn, they changed their minds, their lives and those of their children.  Rodolfo Andragnes is the founder of LABITCONF, which takes place Nov 15 to 20, Bitcoin Argentina’s NGO, LaBitcoineta, Bitcoin Center BsAs and SeedPirates.  We have carried out dozens of nonprofit projects, including conferences, traveling vans, co-working spaces, international NGOs, fundraisings, social impact projects, grants and so on, with the sole purpose of helping more and more people discover something that goes beyond money and technology. Poor or rich it does not matter, for everyone bitcoin implies a change of mentality.  On June 6, the president of El Salvador, a whole country, decided to make bitcoin an official currency, and we felt that as a new call and a new challenge. We felt we should drop everything to help Salvadorans discover the opportunity bitcoin represents for them and put together a more challenging event there than we’ve ever done before.  But why do it if part of the Salvadoran population criticizes bitcoin? Why defend a law that was imposed? Why defend a president whom some criticize? Why do it if some potential attendees still believe it is a dangerous country? Why take on such a great challenge with only two months left? Why do it without earning anything and risking our money and time? Why is it worth the effort?  The answer is simple: because helping people is worth it, because it is not about supporting or defending one or the other, but about betting on the future of all. Because, again, it does not matter if everyone criticizes us, or if they still do not see it, if citizens only see the price and the speculation or if they only read the criticism. It is worth giving them the opportunity to understand and discover that bitcoin is not just a currency but a ticket to more justice, transparency and freedom.  Everything unknown generates fear, but fear protects us as much as it drives us away. That is why, from Nov. 15 to 20, we will assume the risk of doing this event that helps students to program on blockchain, that links up doubters about bitcoin with specialists, hooks up entrepreneurs with new technological solutions and that encourages governments to debate and explore bitcoin’s future.  For that reason, we will do LABITCONF, together with four leading conferences in the continent. It will be a full week with hackathons, fairs, art, business rounds and free conferences, inviting whoever wants to debate. We see it as an effort to promote investment in this beautiful country and make its people and all of Latin America believe that they can also become leaders.  So forget your concerns, and join us in this unique crusade. Help us make history and change people’s future. It is worth it.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Rodolfo Andragnes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/16/bitcoin-in-el-salvador-why-is-it-worth-the-effort,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd36e6e6238905a70b2d4d023a7a933c2fa64adf-1024x684.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Chivo ATM, named after the government-sanctioned crypto wallet Chivo, can be seen below ablaze in the nation’s capital city, San Salvador.  Protesters are also expressing anger over perceived authoritarianism by the president.  Video footage provided by Ruptly shows protesters streaming into San Salvador brandishing signs such as “No to Bitcoin,” “resistance and popular rebellion against the regiment of Bukele,” and “no to corrupt money laundering.”  On Sept. 3, Bukele was cleared by the judiciary to run for another term despite constitutional limits. The judges were appointed in May by Bukele’s ruling party after the previous judiciary was sacked. The September ruling prompted criticism over abuse of power, including from the local U.S. Embassy.  El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law – which was passed by a supermajority in the Salvadoran legislature in June and which went into effect on Sept. 7 – has faced stiff opposition ever since it was proposed.  The law, a first of its kind around the world, enables citizens of the Latin American country to use bitcoin as a means to pay for goods and services alongside the U.S. dollar.  In June, Jaime Guevara, a regional deputy belonging to an opposition party in El Salvador, and a group of citizens sued the government over the law, labeling it unconstitutional.

The first cryptocurrency by market cap trades at $47,837 with a 1.2% loss in the daily chart. BTC&apos;s price has been moving in a tight range during the week, unable to break above $48,500. Data from Santiment suggest an increase in the amount of BTC&apos;s supply exchanging hands since the beginning of September. This suggests that investors could be taking more profits as Bitcoin tries to take previous highs contributing to the bears&apos; attempts to take over the market. As seen below, the BTC Token Circulation metric can be used to find a correlation between the price action and the amount of supply exchanging moving on the network. The firm said: Bitcoin now sits at $48.1k following a volatile couple of weeks to open September. Notably, the amount of unique tokens moving on the $BTC network, known as token circulation, is up big. Wednesday saw 187.91 unique coins moved, the most since July 29. For Analyst Justin Bennet, BTC&apos;s price broke its upward trend during last week&apos;s selloff. In that sense, the analyst found similarities between this event with May&apos;s price action, when Bitcoin experience the first of several capitulation events.

Whales Continue To Accumulate More Bitcoin As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, the Bitcoin sum coin age (SCA) indicator has been going up, showing long-term holders are continuing to accumulate. The SCA is a BTC metric that tells us about the distribution of long-term holders. It&apos;s calculated by taking the product of the UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) alive days and the UTxO value. The &apos;age&apos; of a coin is measured in &apos;coin days.&apos; When a certain amount of BTC remains unspent for a day, it accumulates some fraction of a &apos;coin day.&apos; One whole Bitcoin remaining unspent accumulates one coin day. Similarly, if half a coin remains unspent for a day, it picks up half (0.5) a coin day. With the help of the indicator, it becomes possible to tell what the sentiment among long-term holders is. A dip in the metric&apos;s value would suggest that whales have started moving their coins, while an increase would imply they are continuing their accumulation. Now, here is a chart that highlights the trend of the SCA vs the BTC price: The Bitcoin SCA seems to be climbing straight up | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above chart, the SCA had a minor dip late July, but since then the indicator has been going up in a straight line.

Crypto-native media companies are having a bit of a moment: Trevor McFedries’ Friends With Benefits was recently valued at $100 million after a funding infusion from crypto investment powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz, and social token issuers such as Roll and Rally have raised their profiles significantly over the past few months.  The Forefront round was cobbled together from a group of small firms and investment collectives, including 1kx, MetaCartel Ventures and Scalar Capital, as well as such angel investors as McFedries and Jesse Grushack, formerly of Ethereum software company ConsenSys.  Forefront consists of a website, a newsletter and an accompanying private Discord community. The entry fee to the Discord server is 1,000 $FF tokens, which currently go for about $6.16 a pop – that’s $6,160, not including gas fees.  “This round will help us scale our effort, onboard full-time contributors, and continue to build at the cutting edge of DAOs,” said Forefront founder Carlos Gomes.

Which helps explain why the newest non-fungible token (NFT) collectibles mega-hit, World of Women, is such a welcome jolt of energy for the space. “The mission of my art was always to showcase women, and put them in the spotlight, and bring more diversity into the space,” says Yam Karkai, who launched the NFTs with her partner Raphael Malavieille.  The duo launched the collection on July 27… and it sold out overnight. Its many fans include internet entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, prominent NFT collector Pransky, and YouTuber Logan Paul, who publicly offered to gift Reese Witherspoon a World of Women that looks like the actress.  Jeff Wilser is the author of seven books including “Alexander Hamilton’s Guide to Life,” “The Book of Joe: The Life, Wit, and (Sometimes Accidental) Wisdom of Joe Biden” and an Amazon Best Book of the Month in both non-fiction and humor.  Karkai and Malavieille are not crypto-insiders. They don’t have a history in the space. In something of a meet-cute, the real-life couple met in Paris five years ago, where Karkai was studying acting. (Her pre-NFT life includes theater, scriptwriting and digital illustration.) When NFT collections blew up, they realized this could be a way to more widely distribute Karkai’s art. They worked as a team. Karkai drew and created, Malavieille (with a background in project management) focused on the operations.  The results? Now the floor price of World of Women is 1.5 ETH, or roughly $5,100, meaning that the combined value of the project (10,000 NFTs) is at least $51 million. Karkai and Malavieille share how they launched the collection, the steps they took to promote inclusivity, and what it’s like to suddenly become crypto phenoms.  CoinDesk: So how’d this get started?  Yam Karkai: Well, I felt like I was not reaching a broad enough audience with my 1 / 1 art, in my opinion, for the message and the change that I want to see in this space. So why not do a collectible project that’s women instead of apes, or pandas, or bears? Because women are beautiful, and they’re important, and they’re relevant.  What are some of the reactions you’ve seen?  Karkai: Women telling me, “I’m a woman of color. I’m from Kenya or I’m from India. And it’s the first time there is an avatar that looks like me, and that I feel like could be me or anyone in my family.”  I’m guessing that when you launched, it was very important to be inclusive. Can you talk about that?  Karkai: So, creating the base woman that would be able to be any ethnicity, or any type of person, was extremely important to me. There were a lot of sketches, and a lot of trial and error. But I finally designed a woman that has a round face, so she could be skinny or she could be plus-size; we don’t know because it’s a bust portrait, and we don’t know what the body looks like.  And I also worked to create a shape of eyes that could pass as potentially Asian, or European, or African, etc.  How about skin tones?  Karkai: I was inspired by Fenty Beauty, Rihanna’s makeup line. She has the most diverse skin tone range ever, like in the history of makeup. And I named them respectfully because I saw some projects naming their skin tones black, yellow, and white, and for me that was incredibly disrespectful.  What other cultural sensitivities did you consider?  Karkai: First of all, no religious references. I’m half Middle Eastern, so I really wanted to have a Nazar necklace – the evil eye necklace. But I told myself, no, I’m not going to do that, because if I start putting in stuff from my culture, I’ll need to include everyone else’s, and it’s going to be impossible to please everybody. So no religious things, no political references, and nothing that could be mistaken as disrespectful.  Raphael Malavieille: And then there was the concern for cultural appropriation…  Karkai: For example, when I was drawing hairstyles, Raph came by and he was like, “Hey, why don’t you do a big afro hair?” But I didn’t want to do that because this is a generative project [10,000 unique combinations are generated from the “base assets” that Karkai draws], after all, and if a white girl with blue eyes ends up with an afro, it’s going to look like she’s dressing up as an African-American woman. And that is literal cultural appropriation. That’s the same reason why I didn’t do African braids, or I didn’t include a Muslim veil.  Your social media accounts have exploded. What’s your secret for the crazy fast growth?  Malavieille: While Yam was actually doing the art, I was researching the space. I looked at all the projects that were higher quality, like The Wicked Craniums, or the Bulls on The Block, or the Deadheads. I looked at all of those that would sell out very fast, and have a lot of hype at the time of launching.  And then I was like, okay, this is the methodology, this is what they do. And mostly what works well is to do a giveaway. So we bought from those other projects, we bought some assets, and we used them for giveaways to bring their community to see our project.

Karkai: When we tell our friends what’s going on in this space and what we’re doing, half of them are like, “Wow, that’s amazing. That’s crazy.” The other half are like, “I don’t get this. What is this s**t? What are you talking about? How is that even possible? Can I do the same thing? Can I like be rich tomorrow if I sell something?”  How has it felt to see your collection reach so many people, and to be embraced the way it has?  Karkai: At the beginning I was nervous, but when I saw that people were reacting the way I dreamed they would react, it felt really, really good, and it felt like it was making a difference. Every day, I still get messages from people thanking me for the project and saying that they believe in it so much.  And the community we’ve built is full of positivity, and with people honestly believing that this is the change that the space needs. So, for me, that is extremely rewarding. It’s all I ever wanted really.  Malavieille: Yeah.

The digital asset has seen yearly lows in the exchange reserves, transaction fees, and now, the short-term supply of bitcoin is down. The short-term supply has been shrinking for the past year. With declining volumes showing trends that have not been seen in the past five years. Given the low volume of bitcoin transactions, which has led to low transaction fees, only few bitcoins are moving around the network. One And Three-Month Lows Show Shrinkage Bitcoin is no longer being spent as it was in the past. One of the leading ideas behind the creation of the digital asset was so it could double as a currency, one which was not controlled by any one person or entity. Early adopters stuck to this initial vision. Using BTC for purchases where they can. Metrics show that in the past month, 6.8% of the asset&apos;s total supply has been spent. While the three-month trend shows that only 15.8% of the total supply has been spent by investors.

42421744,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpJxF,1631811561,Space Is the Place for Crypto,"Look up. You can’t see them right now, but if you read this email the day or two after it was sent, there will be four human lives hanging above you. Last night, the Inspiration4 crew reached their cruising altitude of 360 miles above Earth, farther away than the International Space Station or Hubble Space Telescope. It’s a crew composed entirely of non-astronauts, a first, on a trip beyond our atmosphere financed by a payments billionaire.  Why are we taking this orbital interlude in a crypto newsletter? Because the links between crypto and space are growing thick. As the “space economy” is increasingly privatized, it appears as though crypto moguls are determined to be a part of it. Not only that, the two industries are mirrors: real excursions into the weird, great beyond now that the government no longer has a complete monopoly on money or space.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  There are three basic ways crypto and space interact: crypto is a funding source for novel space programs and companies, space is a place to deploy infrastructure to improve crypto networks and crypto could become the monetary standard of future extraterrestrial settlements. There’s nothing inevitable about space colonization or the mass adoption of crypto, but we’re living in a window of time where both can be established.  Yesterday, the Winklevoss twins led a $650,000 seed round into space trade publication Payload. As Axios media reporter Sara Fischer noted, space is currently a $350 billion market. Some 400 space companies were founded in the first two decades of the current century. This capital expenditure is likely to continue, it’s almost assured crypto will play a role.  At the start of next year, for instance, Geometric Energy Corporation plans to launch a 40 kilogram cube satellite aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket headed towards the moon. It’s a trip that reportedly will be funded in full by dogecoin. When announced, SpaceX executive Tom Ochinero said that “DOGE-1” mission “will demonstrate the application of cryptocurrency beyond Earth orbit and set the foundation for interplanetary commerce.”  Then there’s early Bitcoin Core engineer Jeff Garzik, whose SpaceChain corporation is working to integrate space and blockchain technologies. The whole idea is to take advantage of the trustless nature of blockchain to facilitate deep space communication and commerce.  Blockstream, the Bitcoin infrastructure juggernaut, plans to build a floating web of satellites that will make it possible to beam BTC payments across the world, without using the internet, and eventually wherever humans go. This strengthens the Bitcoin network, moving it beyond the reach of nation state attacks and other Earth-bound risks.  See also: Elon Musk Says SpaceX Holds Bitcoin at ‘B Word’ Conference  Of course, not all explorations end up where intended. In 2018, Ethereum venture studio ConsenSys acquired the asteroid mining startup Planetary Resources and pivoted the firm’s attention to building cosmic blockchain tools. ConsenSys saved the firm from insolvency after failing to secure another round of financing.  But after launching a blockchain-based, crowdsourced satellite-tracking project called TruSat in 2019, the company’s prospects dimmed. Last year, ConsenSys auctioned off the firm’s hardware – someone bought a vacuum chamber for $9,100 – and open sourced its intellectual property.

The announcement follows the recent story involving DJ Justin “3LAU” Blau launching the Royal platform that will tokenize song royalties as tokens for anyone to buy and trade.  Solo Music founder and CEO Barron Solomon hopes to compete on this front with lower barriers to entry for users with no knowledge or experience of crypto or blockchain.  While Solo will support Solana digital wallets Sollet and Phantom, for example, fans will not be required to already possess a crypto wallet to use the platform. NFTs can be purchased in U.S. dollars using a credit card as an alternative.  Read more: 3LAU Raises $16M to Tokenize Music Royalties for Artists and Fans  “We can charge somebody $10-$20 for an NFT to get them introduced to the space, and then, maybe as they discover blockchain for the first time, they are more interested in investing in tokenized royalties or moving into something a bit more speculative,” Solomon told CoinDesk in an interview.  Tokenization of royalties represents “phase three” of Solo’s launch, following NFTs and concert ticketing. Solomon told CoinDesk that while tokenizing royalties does not present any particular complications from a technical point of view, there are legal challenges.  “A lot of the issues have more to do with the contracts that are in place with all of the major publishers and the individuals that control those royalty streams,” he told CoinDesk, adding:  “We have a lot of work to do – all of us, the Royal platform included – in order to set a standard for what this is going to look like on the blockchain, which is what we’re working toward right now.”  The platform will launch with country songwriter Eric Paslay and producer Tommy Cecil, both of whom will release several NFTs starting next month.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/16/solana-based-music-marketplace-launches-with-aspirations-to-tokenize-royalties,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd7e597f19488f498dbf3f4cb3cf91e3e795f71e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have given rise to a whole new digital marketplace for art investors, decentralized finance (DeFi) has provided investors with a brand new landscape for using currencies free of conventional limitations. While NFTs have gained groundbreaking momentum for their unique approach to digital collecting—investors now have the opportunity to own exclusive one-off pieces of art from their favourite artist digitally—cryptocurrency has liberated those living in countries with anti-democratic governments that allow banks to have complete control over transactions. It only makes sense that the two could eventually combine to even further disrupt the rapidly evolving investing space. There&apos;s no stopping the vast array of potential that NFTs hold. The new form of digital collectibles can span the spectrum from gifs of sports memorabilia, to photos of esteemed visual artists, to photos of Shiba Inus. Noteworthy NFTs of 2021 include Beeple&apos;s artwork that sold for $69 million, the DogeCoin meme that just this week flew in value from $4 million to $220 million in the space of one day as the meme was split into 17 billion pieces, and famous artist Max Denison-Pender&apos;s live painting that was thrown into a volcano shortly after its photo was taken.

In a press release shared with CoinDesk Thursday, Hedera said 5.4 billion tokens worth $2.5 billion would be allocated to the newly established HBAR Foundation. The remaining amount would go to other initiatives aimed at strengthening the development of the Hedera ecosystem.  Headed by software and M&A industry veteran Shayne Higdon, the HBAR foundation will be an independent organization with autonomy in deploying the HBAR tokens it receives. The foundation aims to boost the Hedera network’s adoption in decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens (NFTS), central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), gaming and other industries.  “Our mission is to fund a future where entrepreneurs form digitally-native economies and ecosystems, controlling their own assets, identities, data, marketplaces and more,” Higdon said. “We are excited to engage with and support organizations and teams that share this vision.”  Read more: HBAR Token Hits Record High as IIT Madras Joins Hedera’s Governing Council  Mance Harmon, CEO of Hedera Hashgraph, said the Hedera network is now the most used, energy-efficient, enterprise-grade public ledger on the market, and further growth hinges on empowering additional organizations. “We are pleased that the Hedera Governing Council has made such a significant commitment to accelerate the decentralized growth and usage of the network,” Harmon said.  The foundation and other development initiatives will soon receive the allocated HBAR tokens from Hedera Treasury accounts. The plan to allocate 20% of the token’s supply for development work was approved at the July 14 Governing Council meeting.  “The foundation will receive HBAR and will use it for partnerships and other initiatives,” Harmon said in a Zoom call. “It’s not the case, though, that we’re pushing 20% of supply into the market tomorrow. No, that’s not happening.”  The HBAR tokens will be part of the released supply but will be given as grants to applications and ecosystem partners building on and utilizing the Hedera network over the coming years, he said.  Hedera is a distributed ledger of transactions using a new consensus algorithm known as hashgraph to process more transactions at scale than proof-of-work and proof-of-stake networks. The hashgraph achieves consensus through gossip protocol, a way of multicasting messages across nodes inspired by epidemics, human gossip and social networks.  The platform is governed by leading global organizations like Boeing, Tata Communications, the Indian Institute of Technology, The London School of Economics and Political Science and Wipro.

42421748,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpK5V,1631796600,Advice You’ve Never Had to Consider Before,"As a financial advisor, you’re expected to understand and give guidance on a variety of subjects. You’ve sat across conference tables and dinner tables, and most recently on Zoom calls, helping your clients better understand risk profiles, efficient allocation, bond yields and exchange-traded funds. You speak eloquently about retirement plans and college plans.  Now comes crypto. As I noted in my previous column, the conversations you’re going to have with clients are unlike any you’ve had in the past. These new conversations are based on new technology, markets, esoteric valuation metrics and business models. Accordingly, you’ll need to understand and advise your clients on issues you may never have considered before.  This column originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  Custody  Custody is an issue when it comes to digital assets because the technology is so new.  Bitcoin was created with the idea that we would each hold our own crypto assets. Of course, that custody was meant to happen in a digital wallet, where we have our own private keys, and which we can’t lose or we also lose access to our crypto. For many who are hard-core bitcoiners, or extremely crypto native, the idea of controlling your own wallet and holding your keys is a must. As more investors have wanted exposure to bitcoin and crypto, we have seen new products and services that move custody, or control of the keys, to a third party.  This is when the new conversations come in. You will need to first think about the custodial options you want for your clients and your practice, and then have those conversations with your clients.  You are used to having all their assets with traditional custodians like Fidelity and Schwab. The extent of the conversation is explaining why the client gets a statement from one of these companies.  Now you’ll have to make decisions about crypto custody and even possibly split their crypto among various offerings for different purposes. You might have some assets at a crypto custodian so that you can trade, while moving some onto a hard wallet, or cold storage offline, to keep it more secure. Of course, being offline comes with risks as well, and you will have to go over wallet and private-key security and estate planning.  Volatility  While 2020 was as volatile a year as we’ve ever seen for equities, volatility still isn’t something we’re accustomed to discussing much with clients. Some tech stocks can fluctuate a few percentage points in a day based on earnings or announcements. That level pales in comparison to regular double-digit percent moves within hours in crypto.  For some, that volatility is reason enough to avoid crypto altogether. However, the chance to have conversations about it with clients will help make you a more valuable advisor.  The first conversation is one of setting the expectation. Your client needs to understand and acknowledge that their digital asset investments can move wildly in one direction or another anytime. It could be during the workday, evening or weekend.  You need to discuss the course of action for certain violent price moves. If bitcoin goes down 15%, do we get out, hold or buy more? Knowing that you have a plan will help your clients, and you, feel less anxious about the volatility.  You also get to have the conversation about how volatility can help a regularly rebalanced portfolio, especially when that volatile asset is highly liquid.  Highly volatile, liquid, alternative assets haven’t existed before, so you can really show your value.  Inflation hedge/store of value  Thinking a bit about inflation is nothing new. You routinely discuss that topic, especially as it relates to future healthcare and education costs. We usually try to offset the increases in costs by being invested in equities that also gain value with inflation.  We really haven’t seen overall economic inflation in about 15 years, as the Fed has somehow managed to keep it at its standard 2%.  With the money printing and spending we saw as a result of COVID, we now have to think about serious inflation – the devaluing of the U.S. dollar.  Now, with crypto, you’ll get to have macroeconomic conversations about the value of dollars relative to a fixed-supply asset like bitcoin. Until now, the closest asset you had to use as a store of value was gold, which has other issues with regard to investment.  The conversation about whether a client should have some funds invested in an asset specifically to offset short to mid-term inflation is a new one, and one in which an astute advisor can shine.  Regulation  This is going to be a fun conversation to have with clients, and one in which you will want to be relatively well versed in order to explain.  The U.S. regulation of cryptocurrency, digital assets, exchanges, banks, custody and investors is changing weekly, and is dependent on the regulators and legislators in office.  Your clients are going to read stories and opinions about whether crypto should be regulated, which assets should be regulated and how they should be regulated. These articles will run the gamut of whether it should be legal at all to how the yields and gains are taxed.  You likely haven’t had to have conversations with clients about assets or investments where the legality and tax treatment are all in question. Regulatory considerations will affect the willingness to invest, the determination of when to buy or sell and the allocation to crypto in the portfolio.  It will likely also cause some anxiety anytime the government discusses or hints at increased regulation, as this may have a negative impact on prices.  FUD: Fear, uncertainty and doubt  FUD is something well known in the crypto community, but is not as common in traditional finance. We use it as a term to describe the news, whether true or not, that drives the price of crypto.  Because crypto is a 24/7/365 asset that is traded internationally, one of hundreds of news items could drive the price higher or lower, somewhere in the world, which will greatly affect the entire market. You can go to bed and everything is fine, and wake up to find prices down 15% because of a rumor on Twitter that the South Korean government is considering banning bitcoin, for example.  There are few institutional analysts, and so traders and investors all over the world trade quickly based on anything even resembling news and try to determine the real effects later.  This leaves you to try to understand what happened and why it happened, and then to possibly explain it to your client. Based on the price movement, you might also have one of those volatility conversations where you look at your plan and determine if it’s time to buy or sell.  Your value for clients  As you can see, much of the value you’ll bring to clients as you adopt crypto into your practice will be the new conversations you’ll have with them on complex topics and issues in the crypto world. This is in contrast to the value many of you provide now, such as choosing investments and managers, portfolio allocation, etc.  These conversations come with the requirement that you understand the technology, the assets and the macro and microeconomic environments in which they are operating, so that you can effectively take in the information from the markets and provide good advice and guidance to your clients.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Adam Blumberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/16/advice-youve-never-had-to-consider-before,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bafac56da3d8eb6fb49104400d00e82190938e8f-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421752,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpK8b,1631796600,"Understanding Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake and Tokens","As we navigate the complex world of cryptocurrency for our clients, it’s especially important to have a clear understanding of how each network operates, how new tokens are created and the reason for their unique designs.  There are two major consensus mechanisms – algorithms used by distributed systems that allow the network to work together and stay secure – used by cryptocurrencies: proof-of-work and proof-of-stake. These methods are used to secure the blockchain, verify transactions, include transactions in the history of the blockchain and to create new coins and tokens.  This column originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s new weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  Proof-of-Work (PoW)  Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to implement proof-of-work – the consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin that allows the network to remain secure. You will often hear the term “miner” in the context of cryptocurrency. Mining the blockchain is referencing this proof-of-work mechanism. A tremendous amount of energy (computing power and electricity) is required to secure the blockchain, and thus the miners are rewarded by earning a distribution of new coins upon successfully auditing the blockchain.  All around the world, miners are competing to secure the Bitcoin blockchain and earn a monetary reward. The reward is currently 6.25 BTC, issued approximately every 10 minutes. This reward will eventually decrease to zero, as the supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21,000,000 coins. This cap exists because that is the maximum number of coins that can be generated, according to the code written by Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  Proof-of-work is a proven mechanism and thus trusted and used by Bitcoin. When the monetary value of the bitcoin network increases, miners are financially incentivized to join the network. This, in turn, strengthens the blockchain and improves security. Because of the tremendous energy needed to mine the Bitcoin blockchain, it is impossible for one single entity to take control of the chain, thus preserving the decentralization and integrity of the coin.  Proof of Stake (PoS)  Developers quickly realized that proof-of-work blockchains have trouble scaling and created cryptocurrencies like Ethereum* (Ethereum 2.0 specifically) that now relies on proof-of-stake – where validators stake coins to win the right to verify a transaction and add it to the blockchain – as the consensus mechanism.  (Important note: Ethereum just had an update, EIP 1559, on its journey from Ethereum 1.0 (PoW) to Ethereum 2.0 (PoS), which has resulted in over 173,000 ETH being burned (destroyed). This so far has led to a 45% net reduction in new ETH token issuance, which many are speculating will continue to drive the price higher (supply vs. demand). As more ETH gets locked up for staking, supply will become more and more scarce, taking a page from the playbook of Bitcoin scarcity.)  Ethereum and other smart-contract-enabled blockchains process a significant number of transactions when compared to non-smart-contract coins such as bitcoin. Ethereum currently processes over 1,000,000 transactions per day, which will increase to many times more than that once the ETH 2.0 upgrade is complete. Compared to approximately 200,000 transactions per day on Bitcoin, it’s easy to see why scaling problems needed to be solved.  Ethereum, for example, is required to process its own transactions, execute smart contract transactions, NFT transactions, etc. Proof-of-stake is the ideal solution for the scaling problems that proof-of-work mechanisms are unable to currently solve.  Not all proof-of-stake coins operate with the same rules, though the validation concept is consistent from coin to coin. Market participants, often called validators, are required to “stake” (contribute) a certain number of coins to be able to help validate transactions. (This is essentially serving the same function as miners.) Each qualifying validator has the ability to earn a reward. The network rewards the validators based primarily on tenure.  To make this as simple as I can: The more powerful your computer and the more energy you put behind it, the greater your odds are of earning a proof-of-work mining reward. The bigger your wallet and the more steadfast your commitment, the greater your chances of earning a proof-of-stake validating reward. Increased dedication of resources toward validation leads to an increased likelihood of being a rewarded validator.  Tokens  Tokens, on the other hand, are outside of the family of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. They are not a currency on their own, but rather a unit of measure that exists on top of an existing cryptocurrency’s framework. They are typically used to represent physical assets, such as real estate or collectibles, digital assets such as processing power or storage and decentralized finance (DeFi).  Recommending an allocation to bitcoin for a client will depend on your investment thesis, recommending ethereum or other proof-of-stake coins will depend on your investment thesis and the same goes with advising on tokens. It’s important to note that each token is unique and any advice applicable to a specific token cannot be applied to other tokens – the same as if you were giving advice on individual equities. Not only is it important to understand the basics of cryptocurrency, but it’s even more important to know how cryptocurrency helps clients reach their goals.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/16/understanding-proof-of-work-proof-of-stake-and-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1050f7ffe5c91240dd42e1627cebc44c6649eb14-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

LayerZero’s “omnichain interoperability protocol” – which offers an alternative to unsecure blockchain bridges on the one hand, and on-chain validation methods that come at a high cost on the other – was also backed by Sino Global Capital, Defiance, Delphi Digital, Robot Ventures, Spartan, Hypersphere Ventures, Protocol Ventures and Gen Block Capital.  The project previously raised $2 million in seed funding in April, bringing its total financing to date to just over $8 million. LayerZero is currently under audit and is expected to launch early in the fourth quarter of this year, the company said.  Blockchain bridge boom  Solving the pressing commercial need to connect decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on different blockchains is currently done in a couple of ways. One way is by using a cross-chain network, which can create a weak and exploitable link, as was seen in the recent PolyNetwork hack. The alternative is using on-chain light nodes to validate block headers on each pairwise chain, which is more secure but becomes very expensive to do on Ethereum, for instance.  LayerZero has augmented the on-chain light node approach, which takes every block sequentially from one chain and takes its block header and writes it to the other chain and vice versa.  “Rather than needing to take every block, many of which you don’t care about, you stream a single block on-demand for the transactions that you do care about,” said LayerZero co-founder Bryan Pellegrino in an interview. “To do this you need the block header and your transaction proof, and then you can combine those and do the validation directly on the chain.”  LayerZero’s “ultralight node” takes one single block in isolation and validates it with the help of blockchain oracle networks like Chainlink and Band, which both work with the protocol. The oracles are responsible for moving the block header, while an open relayer network is responsible for moving transaction proofs, Pellegrino explained.  For an attack on the LayerZero system, there would have to be malicious collusion between the oracle and the relayer network, said Pellegrino, adding:  “In the worst case, the system is as secure as the Chainlink DON [decentralized oracle network], which is a pretty good worst case.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | LINK | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/16/interoperability-startup-layerzero-comes-out-of-stealth-with-6m-in-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59a4ea033adcd162730970466f96298752754235-3000x2055.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chinese authorities are targeting mining operations that have disguised themselves as data researchers or storage facilities, Bloomberg reported Thursday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.  Inspections are being carried out across several Chinese provinces in colleges and research institutions.  Concern over potential power shortages for the coming winter is one of the motivations for the country’s intensified crackdown on crypto mining.  China began taking harsher steps against the mining industry earlier this year, shutting operations in regions such as Qinghai and Sichuan, which are rich in the coal and hydropower that miners were using to fuel their operations.  Many miners have responded by moving out of China, with the U.S. and Kazakhstan appearing to be among the most preferred destinations.  Those that have remained in China appear to be taking more creative steps to continue operating while escaping scrutiny from authorities. One unidentified miner cited by Bloomberg, for example, regularly switches to new facilities to house his equipment, never holding more than 100 machines at one location to make irregular power surges more difficult to spot.

The token is the top-performing digital asset today of any crypto with a market cap of over $1 billion, according to data tracked by Messari. At press time, the token was trading at $103.62.  After the announcement, Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group wrote a bullish tweet stating that he owns ZEN personally and that DCG has a large position, too. (DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk.)  The token’s increase in price is almost certainly related to the “Coinbase Effect,” the price pump that almost all smaller digital tokens experience after their listing on the U.S.-based exchange because of the exposure to a new set of market participants.  Messari conducted its own research into the effect and found that Coinbase listings lead to higher returns, compared with listings on other exchanges.  Horizen is a privacy-orientated cryptocurrency with sidechains that enable anyone to build privacy-based applications. It was launched in 2017 under the name ZenCash.

42407177,Dt7FUyaifSPRP7Z7xlEHqp,1631789024,"Bitcoin’s Blockchain Data Indicates Renewed Institutional Appetite, but Macro Risks Prevail","Bitcoin’s latest breakout above key resistance is backed by renewed interest from large investors, blockchain metrics show.  According to data tracked by analytics firm IntoTheBlock, aggregated daily volume measured in U.S. dollars from on-chain transactions, where each transaction was greater than $100,000, surged to a record $480 billion on Wednesday. In bitcoin terms, the so-called large transaction volume hit a two-year high of over 10 million BTC.  “Institutional activity for bitcoin is picking up momentum as the volume in transactions over $100,000 is setting new highs,” Lucas Outumuro, head of research at analytics firm IntoTheBlock, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  While every large transaction does not necessarily represent purchases by institutions or high-net-worth individuals, the steady uptrend in volume since early August, coupled with the uptick in the balance held by whales and the price recovery, suggests renewed adoption by large investors.  Data tracked by Glassnode and tweeted by William Clemente, lead insights analyst at Blockware Solutions, shows whales, or entities holding at least 1,000 BTC, have accumulated more than 50,000 BTC this month.  Meanwhile, data shared by Santiment shows the supply held by millionaires list or addresses owning 10,000 to 100,000 coins has gone up 60,000 BTC in the past three days alone. IntoTheBlock’s Outumoru also confirmed a pickup in whale demand, saying “addresses with over 1,000 BTC are accumulating.”  With strong hands backing the recent rise above the 200-day moving average at $46,000, the path of least resistance appears to be on the higher side.  Macro risks prevail  Renewed accumulation by whales does not guarantee immunity from macro risks like the debt crisis at the Chinese property giant Evergrande.  Tether Ltd., the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has denied rumors of holding Evergrande’s commercial paper as a reserve. However, cryptos may still feel the heat if the crisis spills over to global markets. That possibility cannot be ruled out given Evergrande’s position in China’s economy, the world’s second largest.  “There are pockets of contagion in Chinese markets from Evergrande’s swoon. The property developer’s woes exacerbate an already softening housing market, which accounts for 28% of China’s economy,” Bloomberg’s Lisa Abramovich tweeted.  According to Reuters, China’s housing authority has notified major banks that Evergrande Group won’t be able to pay loan interest due Sept. 20. The shares in the cash-strapped property giant tanked to a decade low early today.  Futures tied to the S&P 500 Index are trading flat to negative, while bitcoin is changing hands at about $47,900, representing a 0.5% drop on the day.  Aside from broader market sentiment, bitcoin traders could take cues from the U.S. retail sales number scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC. According to FXStreet, the data is expected to show consumer spending dropped by 0.8 in August from July, following July’s 1.1% contraction.  A weaker-than-expected figure would ease concerns of Federal Reserve dialing back stimulus and could lift asset prices higher.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/16/bitcoins-blockchain-data-indicates-renewed-institutional-appetite-but-macro-risks-prevail,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c06a76e67d4e2be392f0c6402716660fabe3b0ac-1480x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Healthcare workers have found themselves in an undesirable position where they spend more time computing patient information instead of doing their job - patient care. This inefficiency, coupled with shrinking health care budgets globally, has resulted in smaller core healthcare staff and supporting cast.

The Patientory Blockchain which encompasses the PTOYMatrix network is the answer to limitations currently facing electronic health record systems. These limitations include lack of security, the threat of malware and compromise, interoperability across different third-party systems, a complicated user interface, and poor user experience.

The investment will support Decentral Games’ rollout of ICE Poker, a new metaverse-based poker game in which players earn money competing against each other and completing daily challenges.

Players can then play poker to earn $ICE tokens and the XP cryptocurrency, allowing them to mint rarer NFTs that earn higher rewards.  The announcement came shortly after Decentral Games formed a similar strategic partnership with Polygon, in which the project behind an Ethereum-scaling product also invested an unspecified amount in Decentral Games to stake $DG tokens.

2804461,https://eng.ambcrypto.com/?p=77243,1631773143,Why Uniswap is likely to move this way in the coming days,"A recent article highlighted the fact that Uniswap's daily active addresses were up by 72.5% since Monday and also depicted the same for other tokens in the DeFi space, namely Maker, Compound and AAVE. This was an early indication of a possible DeFi recovery. Meanwhile, UNI's price has latched onto the positive sentiment as indicated by its weekly gains of nearly 20%, which were the highest among the top 10 coins by market cap. At the time of writing, Uniswap traded at $20.37, down by 2% as part of a wider correction in the broader market. Uniswap Daily Chart Source: UNI/USD , TradingView UNI's pickup from its demand zone of $13-16 was important as bulls avoided a sharper retracement towards late-January levels. The digital asset has risen steadily over the past two weeks and has even flipped its 20-SMA (red) back to bullish. A key resistance zone now rested between Visible Range's POC at $20.5 and 29 May's swing low of $21.5. A successful close above these levels could initiate the next upswing in the market. However, bulls had to negotiate a period of selling pressure before triggering such an outcome. A fall below the daily 20-SMA could result in another decline towards UNI's demand zone. Reasoning The Relative Strength Index formed higher highs and was in an uptrend over the past few days. A move above 55 would be the first in over a month and a half, something that would indicate a strengthening trend. The Aroon up was close to 100% as an uptrend was still active despite some selling pressure in the market. Even the Awesome Oscillator noted a series of green bars as bullish momentum was on the rise. The aforementioned signs were certainly a positive with regards to UNI's long-term trajectory and its 26th May swing of $30 would be under the bullish crosshair moving forward. Conclusion The current wave of selling pressure did not seem enough to deter Uniswap from a projected breakout above $21.5 in the coming days- an event that could trigger an even sharper comeback towards the $30-mark. However, the broader market was still in a sensitive position and traders must also be wary of another sell-off in case UNI's loses out on its 20-SMA.

The fund, filed by First Trust Advisors L.P., aims to “provide investors with capital appreciation.” First Trust has retained SkyBridge Capital to serve as investment sub-advisor to the fund. SkyBridge will be responsible for the selection and monitoring of securities in the fund’s investment portfolios.  The latest application for a crypto ETF follows a previous bitcoin ETF application filed in May by SkyBridge. The SEC extended its review of the firm’s application in July and again in August. SkyBridge’s bitcoin ETF application remains in limbo until SEC Chairman Gary Gensler decides whether to approve a crypto-based ETF.  Additionally, Scaramucci announced an Algorand fund during the SALT hedge fund conference in New York, which included luminaries in the financial world such as Ray Dalio, CEO of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund; Steven Cohen, founder of the Point72 Asset Management hedge fund and owner of the New York Mets; and financier Mike Novogratz, who founded finance company Galaxy Digital. Scaramucci founded SALT in 2009. Algorand is a decentralized blockchain network.  “SkyBridge now has about $700 million in crypto,” Scaramucci said in an interview with CNBC Wednesday. “We’re starting an Algorand fund ... we’re capping that fund at $250 million, we’ve already got $100 million raised for that fund.”  Read more: Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital Launches NFT Platform at SALT 2021  Correction: (Sept. 19, 2021, 16:06 UTC): Changes wording on ETF filing.

As price recovers and consolidates above $0.23 support level, trading volume has dipped near 40 percent on the intra-day trade. This can be linked to controversy surrounding Dogecoin and Coinseed Inc., a cryptocurrency exchange that was shut down by New York Attorney General Letita James. The reason behind came as Coinseed converted customers&apos; funds into Dogecoin and allegedly violated the Martin Act. Over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin price has been oscillating between a narrow range of $0.236 and $0.243, suggesting price is facing consolidation after last week&apos;s decline. Trading volume shows a worrying sign for DOGE bulls, as it dropped near 40 percent, suggesting there is very little momentum in the market. Dogecoin price went up almost 1 percent over the past 24 hours, following a positive day trade for the larger cryptocurrency market.

42407169,Dt7FUyaifSPRP7Z7xlEHJ1,1631759900,Top Australian Crypto Exchanges Say They Aren’t Threatened by the Bigger Players,"Four of Australia’s top crypto exchanges say they aren’t concerned that some of the industry’s biggest players have had the country in their sights for quite some time.  In recent years, Kraken, Gemini, and Binance have all set up shop in the country, aiming to carve out some of the domestic market share.  And while total app downloads across both iOS and Google platforms show a rise in popularity among outside players, local incumbents Swyftx, CoinSpot, CoinJar, and BTC Markets remain unfazed.  “The competitive landscape has evolved and we’ve seen multiple exchanges come and go,” said Gary Howells, chief product officer at CoinSpot. “We are continually staying agile by adding new projects to the platform.”  Gemini, one of the first among today’s major global exchanges to begin operations in Australia, set up shop in mid-2019. A year later in June, Kraken launched a new Australian fiat-to-crypto exchange. Binance followed suit a month later. Binance Australia is locally registered and operated by InvestbyBit Pty Ltd., a point Binance has hammered home with multiple jurisdictions on more than one occasion, including Singapore, and Malta.  “We generally find that Australian customers prefer to use Australian exchanges with local support,” said Dominic Gluchowski, chief marketing officer at CoinJar. “While we can’t compete with the advertising spends and campaigns of the international heavy-hitters, we still tend to outperform on a dollar-to-dollar basis due to better understanding of local market conditions.”  The Australian market has proved a tough nut to crack for both crypto and traditional financial businesses looking to establish a foothold on the island nation. Like most regions, locals prefer to use platforms based on their local currency, with support offered in their native tongue. At press time, CoinSpot currently ranks fifth in terms of popularity among iOS devices within the finance category.  The larger players say it is less about carving out a share in the market and more about education to fuel further crypto adoption in those regions.  “The Australian market is key to achieving global adoption and our local strategy focuses on supporting this through education,” said Jonathan Miller, managing director of Kraken Australia.  Leigh Travers, CEO of Binance Australia agreed, saying the crypto industry was still in its infancy and had room to grow.  “With a market that has around one million crypto users, and an equities market that has ten million traders, there is a huge potential,” said Travers.

The country’s central bank has dismissed cryptocurrency assets as a fringe investment not worth policing, even while it explores the potential benefits of a central bank digital currency.  “We don’t yet know the contents of any proposed Australian regulations, said Caroline Bowler, CEO at BTC Markets. “We do know, however, that they are coming. It’s reasonable to expect they will be similar to the traditional financial industry. From experience, this means increased reporting, system testing, external auditing, controls on advertising - to name a few.” Binance is already acquainted with Australia’s stance toward crypto derivatives, having curbed its offerings last month.  Still, the competitive landscape amongst crypto exchanges is growing. And while the advertising spend cannot be matched by the smaller exchanges, it does appear as though the larger players are proving successful in marketing their platforms to local Australians, despite what CoinSpot, CoinJar, BTC Markets, Swyftx say.  Swyftx, one of Australia’s fastest-growing marketplaces, has climbed the rankings in total app downloads and is currently placed at 28 in terms of the total number of downloads within the finance category for iPhones. Though that placement pales in comparison to Crypto.com (4th), CoinSpot (5th), and Binance (9th). For those using the Google store, results were within a similar margin with Binance (5th), CoinSpot (6th), Crypto.com (7th), and Swyftx (20th) all featuring in the top 20. In June 2021, iOS devices held a 55.86% share of the mobile operating system market in Australia, according to data by Statista.  The exchanges are part of a growing chorus claiming they don’t feel threatened by the likes of Binance, Kraken, or Gemini.  “Traditionally, the Australian market in financial services has proved pretty resilient to competition from international providers because factors like trust, customer service, local presence, and transparency are such fundamental drivers of choice over here,” said Tommy Honan, head of strategic partnerships at Swyftx. “Long-term, we see no reason to believe this won’t be the case in the digital assets’ industry.”  Though all exchanges agreed competition was a necessary benefit to the domestic landscape, especially in reducing costs while forcing improvements to their platforms as well as driving innovation.  “As in most sectors of the economy, the benefits of full, effective competition in the crypto space are enhanced efficiency, the provision of better products to consumers, greater innovation and lower prices,” said Jeremy Ng, managing director of Gemini’s Asia Pacific arm.
