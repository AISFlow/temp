42400923,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLPuB,1516834845,Bitcoin Exchange Hit By Armed Robbers in Thwarted Theft,"Ottawa police are seeking two suspects after an attempted armed robbery at a cryptocurrency exchange.  Three people entered the offices of Canadian Bitcoins in Ottawa carrying handguns and restrained four employees on Tuesday morning, according to CBC News. At that point, they attempted to compel one of the employees to make an outbound transaction from the exchange. A fifth employee called police before any assets could be taken, police told the news service.  One suspect has been arrested and charged, according to police. The charges include robbery with a firearm and forcible confinement.  The names of the suspects were not released.  CBC News reported in a Facebook post that the suspects were looking for physical cash, but other armed robberies have successfully made off with cryptocurrency wallets.  The New York District Attorney's Office filed armed robbery and kidnapping charges against New Jersey native Louis Meza after he allegedly stole more than $1.8 million of ether last November. In the filing, the DA's office claimed Meza held his victim at gunpoint, forcing him to turn over a cell phone and private keys, which he used to access the victim's digital wallet.

Listia, which is planning to launch its decentralized marketplace next month, drew funding from more than 4,000 people during the sale. Founded in 2009, the startup already operates a more traditional online market but is moving develop new services by utilizing the technology.  The company said that the sale ended in about 12 minutes after it hit the hard-cap of $15 million. Contributors to the sale include ConsenSys Ventures and Tetras Capital, according to CEO Gee Chuang.  The company also announced that it will launch its Ink Protocol on its marketplace on Feb. 28. On the same day, the site’s users will receive Listia's native XNK tokens, which they can use to purchase or sell goods listed on the company’s website. Chuang said the launch will see up to 10 million users receiving XNK tokens.  The Ink Protocol aims to decentralize marketplaces by enabling users to establish their own credibility without fear of having their profile taken down by the website they are selling goods on.  Chuang explained:  ""[The] Ink Protocol decentralizes marketplaces by allowing buyers and sellers to control their own reputation, choose any marketplace platform they prefer using, and safely pay for goods and services without relying on any central service provider.""  Listia wants to leverage the protocol as a way to allow users to list the same item on multiple marketplaces, with each listing changing as necessary if the item is bought – without requiring the seller to manually edit the listing’s information, as previously reported by CoinDesk.

As quoted by The Royal Gazette, premier David Burt remarked during an appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the country was aiming to shift away from its ""old school"" system of recording deed information.  The Royal Gazette  quoted Burt as saying:  ""Bermuda has an old school deeds-based property system. What we are going to do is transfer our registry to the blockchain. Clearly it needs to be transparent so people know what’s there and be secure, and that way we know who owns what at any point in time""  Burt reportedly remarked that some segments of Bermuda’s business ecosystem – namely the legal profession – may not be fully supportive of the move. That said, according to the premier, ""the thing is to make more efficiencies inside of our economy.""  The development reflects Bermuda’s continued engagement with the blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  In November, the British overseas territory set up a task force seeking to both create an appropriate regulatory environment and to support commerce utilizing these technologies in the hopes of attracting new industry and jobs. The government is also working with organizations such as Ambika Group and the Bermuda Business Development Agency on possible uses of the tech.

On Tuesday, celebrity gossip site TMZ reported that 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, had garnered about 700 BTC after moving to accept the cryptocurrency for the album. At the time, the rapper was accepting payments through processor startup BitPay. At the time, that amount was worth about $400k, and by the publication's estimation, his holdings are now worth somewhere between $7 million and $9 million.  The performance artist has confirmed the TMZ article, posting its text to Instagram and writing: ""Not Bad for a kid from South Side, I'm so proud of me."" In a comment on the social media site, he claimed that he had forgotten about the cache of bitcoin in the years since the Animal Ambition move.  Jackson has a history of entrepreneurial success, most famously as an early investor in Glaceau, which Coca-Cola later acquired for $4.1 billion. He has an extensive portfolio that includes a clothing line, dietary supplements and real estate among other things.  Yet he made waves by taking the step to accept bitcoin for the album, joining the ranks of other musicians who in past years have made similar moves. That year, for example, rock group Mastodon similarly started taking bitcoin via BitPay, and in November of last year, Icelandic singer Bjork revealed that her ""Utopia"" album would be available to buyers using multiple cryptocurrencies.

Dubbed VersaVault, the service will act as a means to store cryptocurrencies and other types of digital property, according to a Tuesday announcement. The product represents an expansion of sorts for the Canadian bank, which doesn't operate any physical branches and is primarily focused on deposits and financing. VersaBank was founded in the early 1980s and is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  President and CEO David Taylor positioned the product from the perspective of asset safety, pointing to the cybersecurity challenges that surround the handling of cryptocurrencies.  ""Bitcoin and other crypto currencies [sic] are quickly gaining popularity and holders have already experienced their valuable holdings vanish from the less secure 'digital storage' options,"" he said in a statement.  VersaBank has tapped Gurpreet Sahota, formerly the principal architect of cybersecurity at smartphone maker Blackberry, to spearhead the project. Sahota will also act as the bank’s chief architect of cybersecurity.  “Banks have always been known as the safest place to store physical valuables and it is our aim to make VersaVault the safest place to secure your digital valuables, with absolute privacy,"" Sahota said in a statement.

""Goldman's effort involves both its currency-trading division and the bank's strategic investment group, the people said. That suggests the firm believes bitcoin's future is more as a payment method rather than a store of value, like gold,"" the newspaper reported at the time.  Speaking with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, CEO Lloyd Blankfein called the report ""not true"" – though his comments left the door open to the possibility that Goldman could, one day, move in that direction.  He told the network, according to a transcript:  ""What we said was we were opening – we, we're clearing futures in bitcoins for some of our futures clients. We'd clear them. We're a prime broker and so if our clients are going to do it, we're going to do it. A principle bitcoin business where we're going long and short, market making, so far we're not[.]""  The network went on to ask Blankfein if his family has gotten involved in bitcoin, to which he replied: ""I can't speak for all of my – you know, for all of my Millennial children,"" going on to add ""but the grownups aren't.""  His remarks come months after Blankfein expressed openness toward bitcoin, comments that came amid a period during which some notable Wall Street figures, including JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon, were decrying the cryptocurrency as ""a fraud.""

Introduced on Jan. 23, a new House Joint Resolution, if enacted, would establish a subcommittee to explore how blockchain could improve government operations including in areas such as state record-keeping, information storage and service delivery.  According to the proposal, the detailed scope of the study would include examining how feasible it would be to implement the technology, as well as coming up with a realistic estimated timeline and impact assessment for the implementation. Other focuses may also cover case study research and how existing laws can be amended to foster blockchain development in Virginia.  So far, the bill has been referred to Committee on Rules, records show.  According to the bill, while the study group is not likely to receive an official budget for its costs, the House of Delegates would create a cryptocurrency wallet for private donations to fund the work.  The new legislative initiative comes just a few days after the state's senate introduced another bill that would launch a study of the impact of cryptocurrencies on the lives of Virginia's inhabitants – perhaps signaling increasing interest from lawmakers in exploring blockchain's potential to advance its information technology capacity.  Meanwhile, a similar growth of interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can also be seen in the neighboring state of West Virginia.  Also introduced on Jan. 23, a new House Resolution requests that West Virginia's Joint Committee on Government and Finance ""study bitcoin, its future and potential impact on the state, its citizens, and businesses.""

According to a release, the partners will work to complete a system that integrates blockchain with the internet of things (IoT), and combines Skuchain's EC3 blockchain platform and NTT DATA’s iQuattro platform.  The blockchain solution is aimed to help solve problems with traditional supply chain methods, including data unavailability, issues in manual processes, increased costs due to lack of coordination, market failure, and more.  Skuchain and NTT Data will jointly market the product to enterprises in Japan and other markets, the release states.  The integrated blockchain-IoT solution is designed to manages and optimize all aspects of a supply chain, utilizing Skuchain's Popcodes app for tracking supplies and the firm's Brackets smart contracts app for managing flow of transactions.  The partners have already completed a pilot in partnership with a Japanese firm and its supply chain in China. Skuchain and NTT Data now plan to conduct additional pilots with other Japanese companies.  Blockchain technology is increasingly being eyed by the supply chain industry as a means to bring new efficiencies and lower costs.

42400925,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLNy9,1516798810,Decentralization vs Scale: Crypto's Growing Struggle,"You can't have your cake and eat it too, the old saying goes. In the cryptocurrency space, the big question is whether you can have decentralization and scale it too.  The struggle between these two goals has become more noticeable as a rush of new enthusiasts have entered the space, lured by the technology being floated as a fix to many of the world's problems (well, that and greed).  Underscoring the urgency of the problem, a number of researchers are studying whether there's a balance to be struck between decentralization – the key non-financial motivation for cryptocurrency and blockchain excitement – and these networks' ability to scale to an ever-growing number of users.  Cornell University researcher Adem Efe Gencer explains the predicament well, telling CoinDesk:  ""The key impetus behind the interest in blockchains is decentralization of power among entities with minimal trust relationships. But, there's a fundamental tension between scale and decentralization. While we know how to get scale, scaling solutions may require compromising the decentralized nature of blockchains.""  And this dilemma has become more serious as users face deep transaction backlogs and rising transaction fees on the most popular blockchains dealing with the weight of increased adoption.  In response, many wonder whether the blockchain deserves all the attention it's currently receiving – or if it's yet another overhyped technology sector where expectations outpace actual usefulness.  At this point, there are solutions under development, such as bitcoin's Lightning Network, but there are always trade-offs to be made.  Gencer's new paper and a handful of others recently published explore just how decentralized the most popular blockchains are, and how resistant they will be in the future to being taken taken over by a controlling force as new technology for scaling is added.  Mirroring the debates in the bitcoin community about the best way to overcome the problem, the researchers each stressed different possible solutions in their findings: on-chain, off-chain and at the consensus protocol level.  Just how decentralized?  In their paper, Gencer and his co-authors aim to ""scientifically quantify"" the decentralization of the networks bitcoin and ethereum.  To do this, the paper brings together a range of metrics, including how many miners (the stakeholders that order and verify transactions on the network with the use of computer hardware) a network has, how many nodes, how much bandwidth it takes to send blocks across the network and so forth.  Looking at this big picture can help researchers to potentially address the scalability problem. Gencer told CoinDesk:  ""While we know how to get scale, scaling solutions may require compromising the decentralized nature of blockchains.""  With that in mind, the research sheds some light on the ""viability of different scaling proposals.""  For example, the block size can be increased up to 1.7 times to improve on-chain scaling without harming decentralization in some ways, the authors found.  It's worth noting Gencer and his colleagues' findings have been debated fiercely on social media. Because decentralization is such a complex property to measure in a system like bitcoin, many contend other elements of decentralization would need to be taken into account to get the full picture.  The scaling 'triangle'  Another quantitatively focused paper exploring the issue was published on arXiv last week by Greg Slepak, the founder of decentralized technology non-profit OkTurtles.  The paper describes the ""basic theory"" behind the scalability problem by way of a triangle (another researcher, Ocean Protocol founder Trent McConaghy, independently came up with this same idea).  Each point of the triangle represents one of the three properties that blockchains need – scale, the ability to support many users; decentralization, a state of affairs in which no one entity controls the system; and consensus, the agreement between each node on the validity of transactions.  Just as one line of a triangle can touch only two of the three points, so too, are blockchain developers only able to focus and succeed in two of the three properties necessary for decentralized blockchains.  For instance, blockchain developers can have a system that scales and reaches consensus, but it will be at the expense of full decentralization.  Still, Slepak's research was more optimistic than Gencer's, since the paper claims there's evidence that off-chain networks, such as Lightning Network, can ""get around"" this tricky trio of trade-offs.  To do so, the paper contends, off-chain solutions like bitcoin's Lightning Network can ""relax"" the definition of consensus. Rather than requiring nodes to hold every transaction that ever happens within the system, nodes only need to keep track of some transactions requested by users in 'rare moments.'""  Arguing that his research describes, in more formal terms, the trade-offs that have been at the heart of bitcoin's years-long scaling debate, Slepak told CoinDesk:  ""This seems pretty important to me given the fuss around [bitcoin's] block-size debate.""  The base layer  Meanwhile, University College London postdoctoral researcher Shehar Bano has also been researching the scaling/decentralization conundrum, but as it relates to each particular blockchain's consensus protocol.  In a paper titled ""Systemization of Knowledge,"" Bano aggregates a number of different consensus protocols, including proof-of-work (which bitcoin uses) and proof-of-stake, and compares them, in order to figure out where development is wanting.  ""Researchers can then look at it and think, 'Oh, I can contribute here,' or 'Oh, here's a gap,'"" Bano said.  Despite the sprawling scope of the paper, decentralization was one of the main trade-offs Bano mentioned in conversation with CoinDesk.  ""Because what shows up in some blockchains is that, while the system is decentralized, somehow due to the governance structures or the nature of the protocol, centralization happens again,"" she said. ""We can see this with bitcoin mining,"" where just three pools account for roughly 56 percent of the hashing power right now.  Solving the problem will hinge on developing better consensus protocols, Bano argued, concluding:  ""The other features are really the icing on top of the cake. Consensus protocols are the cake.""

Prices on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) fell to $9,972.29 yesterday, before witnessing a quick recovery to $11,000 levels. This is the fourth time in last week that bitcoin (BTC) has recovered losses after sinking below $10,000 levels. As of writing, bitcoin is at $10,990 levels. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 3.38 percent in the last 24 hours, according to OnChainFX.  On Coinbase's GDAX exchange, BTC witnessed two-way business yesterday with prices hitting highs and lows of $$11, 370 and $9,945, respectively, before closing (as per UTC) at $10,824 levels.  The situation looks no different today as the rebound from the intraday low of $10,450 seems to have run out of steam above $11,000 levels. The cryptocurrency was last seen changing hands on GDAX at $10,970 levels.  The two-way price action witnessed in the last 24 hours is indicative of indecision in the marketplace and a decisive move (in either direction) would likely set the tone for the market. That said, the price chart analysis today puts the odds of a decisive move higher above 50 percent.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  BTC has consistently found takers at or below $10,000 (marked by circles).  On a daily closing basis, bears have been repeatedly failed to push prices below $10,391.02 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 low to 2017 high).  The previous day's doji candle indicates indecision in the market. Note that the doji candle has appeared following a 44 percent drop from the all-time highs and at critical support ($10,391.02). So it is safer to say that the candle also reflects bearish exhaustion.  Hence, BTC may be likely to see a stronger move higher and establish a bullish short-term bias.  View  A positive close (as per UTC) today, preferably above $11,370 (yesterday's doji candle high), would confirm a bullish doji reversal and open doors for $13,000. A violation there would open up upside towards $15,733 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of December high to January low).  On the downside, a close (as per UTC) below $10,391 could yield a sustained move lower to $9,000.  However, while there are signs of green shoots on bitcoin chart, the market capitalization chart of all cryptocurrencies calls for caution.  Total market cap of cryptocurrencies  The market cap chart shows the formation of a head-and-shoulders bearish reversal pattern. A bearish pattern on market cap could be an indication of remaining weakness across the wider cryptocurrency market. Hence, there is merit in being cautious.

42400900,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLNsF,1516791620,US Government Lab Looks to Blockchain for P2P Energy,"Blockchain startup BlockCypher has partnered with a U.S. Department of Energy lab to develop solutions allowing energy transactions to be settled across multiple blockchains.  The energy agency's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and BlockCypher first plan to demonstrate peer-to-peer energy transactions involving distributed energy resources (DER) over the dash cryptocurrency network between two test homes in the NREL's energy facility, said Dylan Cutler, senior engineer for the initiative at NREL.  He said in a release:  ""Blockchain technology presents a transformative and highly scalable platform for enabling distributed energy markets, which could enable DER to interact more effectively with the larger grid. These interactions include more efficient demand response, capacity reserves, power quality support.""  According to Karen Hsu, head of growth at BlockCypher, people can exchange renewable energy peer to peer with the project's technology. ""This would be important in a natural disaster or when the grid goes down for extended periods, just like weve seen last year across the U.S.,"" she said.  The solution – which is planned to be blockchain agnostic – would also help streamline energy consumption by matching power generation with demand, and reducing power deficits during times of high energy usage, Hsu added.  Smart meters with the ability to exchange cryptocurrency for electricity could also make the grid ""more efficient and stable by enabling the monetization of stored energy and energy production at the endpoints of the grid,"" said Dash Core's CEO, Ryan Taylor.  Globally, Australian, Japanese, and European energy providers have been starting to develop blockchain-based energy projects in recent months.  Further, a research lab within the U.S. Department of Energy revealed last October that it is exploring the application of blockchain in managing next-generation power grids. In January 2017, the agency began publicly soliciting blockchain research proposals for ""novel concepts for energy systems that rely on blockchain.""

42400903,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLNuD,1516788036,South Korea Fines Crypto Exchanges for Privacy Failures,"The South Korea government has today issued fines totaling 141 million won ($130,000) to domestic cryptocurrency exchanges for providing insufficient user data protection.  In a public announcement, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) said the penalty is a result of an investigation that the agency conducted from Oct. 10 to Dec. 28 in 2017 across 10 domestic crypto exchanges. Launched as a ministry-level agency, KCC is responsible for regulating the broadcasting and telecommunications sector, as well citizen's information protection.  Among the 10 surveyed companies, eight were found to be violating the Information and Communication Network Act, which mandates user privacy protection methods, according to the announcement.  The eight penalized companies are: Upbit, Ripple4y, Coinpia, Youbit, Korbit, Coinone and Coinplug, as well as Eyalabs, a cryptocurrency wallet service. According to the agency, the individual fines range from $9,000 to $14,000.  The announcement details that critical violations include some exchanges failing to delete users' data even when they had stopped using the service for over a year, and some others storing users' data outside of the country.  KCC chairman Lee Hyo-Sung said:  ""While the security threats such as virtual currency speculation and hacking of handling sites are increasing, the actual situation of personal information protection of major virtual currency exchanges is very weak. Therefore, we will try to reduce the damage of users through more strict sanctions.""  The KCC subsequently required these exchanges to take actions in resolving the issue within 30 days and file reports to the agency. In addition, the regulator said it will draw up and implement plans pertaining to managing cryptocurrency wallets, private keys and cryptocurrency transactions to serve as administrative guidance for exchanges.  While the amount of the individual fines may not be significant, the move arrives just a day after the country's financial watchdog set a date for the formal cessation of anonymous cryptocurrency trading, yet another signal of the effort underway by the country's authorities to increase regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges.

42400908,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLO16,1516784432,Would Israel's ICO Tax Plan Retain Startups or Scare Them Off?,"There's a handful of initial coin offering (ICO) issuers working out of Tel Aviv, Israel, but they typically domicile elsewhere.  That's not particularly helpful for the government since it loses out, not only on tax revenue, but also opportunities to market Israel as a place to do business.  And according to some, the Israel Tax Authority's (ITA) draft circular, published last week, detailing how domestic companies' ICO revenue could be taxed, is an effort by the Israeli government to entice token issuers to stay on the Middle Eastern soil.  ""Up until now all Israeli ICOs ran the ICO from either Switzerland or Gibraltar,"" said Uriel Peled, a co-founder of two Israeli crypto startups. Both countries are known as business-friendly tax havens.  In Peled's eyes, the ITA is taking steps to legitimize the business of companies financed by ICOs, in an effort to make the country just as attractive. (The ITA did not respond to request for comment from CoinDesk delivered through a third party.)  CoinDash, Matchpool and Kik, all of whose teams fully or partly work in Israel, have moved their bases outside the country. Plus, Sirin Labs, which raised $157 million in an ICO recently, is largely based in Tel Aviv, but its website shows a company address in Switzerland.  One of the main reasons the ITA's circular might be appealing to token issuers is that it describes deferrals on when ICO income would become taxable, plus it mentions the potential for crypto companies to earn special tax treatment.  As such, according to Peled, the industry will see more companies officially operating from Israel this year, although he declined to give any specific names. One of his startups, a consultancy called CoinTree, is encouraging clients to consider an Israeli address.  Pointing to what he sees as an advantage to working in a country that is trying to move cryptocurrency out of a gray area, Peled told CoinDesk:  ""The goal of the blockchain industry in Israel is not to stay under the radar. It’s always been clear to us that there will be regulations and we want to work with government to help create regulations that are good for both sides.""  Realizing the magnitude  Global consulting giant Deloitte helped the ITA craft the circular, providing extensive feedback by invitation, according to Yitzchak Chikorel of Deloitte's international taxation team.  Chikorel and others were able to convince the authority that drawing distinctions between different crypto tokens – whether it be the original currency tokens, such as bitcoin; crypto tokens created to fund the building of a platform that the coins will be used to access in the future; or crypto tokens that act as equity – would be key to writing successful regulation.  ""The main focus is the utility coins which are also in the heart of the tax circular,"" Chikorel told CoinDesk. ""Our main focus was to tie a direct and clear line between the technology to the tokens, arguing they are connected one to each other in an inseparable tie.""  Plus, the circular makes it clear that income will not automatically be taxed when it is first received.  Chikorel likened this to a gift card purchase – in many places around the world, income from a gift card purchase doesn't become taxable until someone spends the amount on the gift card, and the company can actually determine how much profit it realized.  Similarly, as people start to spend the tokens bought in an ICO to purchase items on a new platform, the company will then calculate how much profit it made after it built the software and acquired customers.  The circular also acknowledges that blockchain-based companies could apply for further tax advantages under Israel's Encouragement of Capital Investment Law, which was broadly designed to attract and retain high-tech companies.  Chikorel said he's pretty confident such applications would be accepted, telling CoinDesk:  ""The ITA has realized the magnitude and the importance of the blockchain as an evolutionary technology that could allow the creation of the next generation of multinational companies.""  Keeping them away  Having said that, others aren't so sure that tax laws will persuade Israeli companies to bring their ICO income home.  First of all, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, mirroring some of the anti-establishment sentiment of the industry as a whole, have not typically viewed regulatory actions as comforting, even though many say these kinds of moves legitimize the industry.  ""Currently, I'm unaware of any Israeli company who did, or plans to do, an ICO under Israeli jurisdiction,"" said Lior Jaffe, co-founder of Jelurida, the Israeli startup behind blockchain platforms Nxt and Ardor. ""And these regulations, if accepted, pretty much ensure that this will stay this way.""  Secondly, taxes are just part of the regulatory landscape, and the Israel Securities Authority (ISA), which regulates securities in the country, has yet to formally rule on how ICO tokens should be categorized. However, in September, it established a committee to look into the actions taken by other securities regulators around the world and decide on whether it should consider ICOs part of its purview.  Not many countries' securities regulators have set hard-and-fast definitions for ICO tokens. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman has stated that most projects he's reviewed appear to be securities, and has moved to prosecute several ICO founders. Russia has been more decisive and China outright banned ICOs.  Possibly hinting at tighter rules, the head of the ISA, Shmuel Hauser, said the regulator will seek to ban any company that has major involvement in bitcoin trading from listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE).  Yet, as a small country lacking a global financial hub (like London or New York), Jaffe argued, Israel should go out of its way to keep its domestic high-tech companies local.  ""The only practical way to achieve this is to announce that all revenues from ICOs are considered an investment and therefore exempt from taxes for a period of several years,"" he contended, adding:  ""I think the state of Israeli is missing out on a huge opportunity to become a crypto-friendly jurisdiction.""

Called the ""holy grail"" of cryptocurrency, stablecoins have been heralded as a way to strengthen the commercial case for blockchains, since many businesses shy away from the volatility associated with the sector.  Case in point: an increasing number of decentralized apps (Dapps) rely on ether, and on internal crypto tokens dependent on ether, as a way to distribute value. As a result, unpredictable market shifts in the price of ether could cause chaos in the system.  Dapp users would be less likely to spend their tokens if they believed the value might double overnight; conversely, should potential users suspect the value of the Dapp tokens will plummet, that could discourage them from participating at all.  For this reason, Rune Christensen, the founder of MakerDAO, the company behind the DAI stablecoin, which was launched in December, told CoinDesk:  ""[Stablecoins] are the first step before you actually see anything else interesting happening. I would argue that the reason why the blockchain world is so vapor-wary ... is basically because you just cannot do business in an unstable environment.""  And in this pursuit of stability, interest in refining the stablecoin technology seems to be on the rise moving into 2018.  Not only did an all-star group of investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Pantera Capital, back a stablecoin project called basecoin in October, but CoinDesk has heard more such projects are on their way.  Plus the popularity in China of BitCNY – which is pegged to the Chinese renminbi and has entirely replaced renminbi trading pairs due to strict regulation of fiat/crypto trading in the country – led Christensen to describe stablecoins as ""pretty much the best example of blockchain done right at the moment.""  Yet, according to critics, DAI's brief spell of trading for around 72 cents only foreshadows impending doom that the market has seen several times already with stablecoins.  An inauspicious start  While stablecoins see trading in the tens of billions of dollars per day, many crypto enthusiasts have called the technology the ""single point of failure"" for the entire crypto industry.  Preston Byrne, an independent consultant and the former chief operating officer and legal counsel of Monax Industries, has even gone so far as to call stablecoins the ""single dumbest creature in the entire universe,"" alluding to the Bugblatter Beast from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""  And such criticisms are not entirely unfounded.  Perhaps the most well known of the stablecoins is USDT (U.S. dollar tether), which acts as a stand-in for the dollar on some of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. And while that function seems to validate its existence, the company behind the coin, Tether Limited, has seen its fair share of controversy.  For instance, last year, Tether Limited was allegedly hacked for $30 million in USDT.  And in a wave of recent accusations, the relationship between Tether Limited and the Bitfinex exchange has been harshly criticized.  While Tether's U.S. dollar-pegged crypto has been around since July 2014, formerly under the name Realcoin, Bitfinex, under immense pressure after losing banking relationships and the ability to send fiat wire transfers, ushered in broader use of the Tether stablecoin in 2015. USDT is widely seen as a substitute for traditional banking services, allowing users to withdraw and deposit dollar amounts quickly.  But since then, there has been much scrutiny of the close ties between Bitfinex and Tether (the companies have common ownership and management) and accusations of mismanagement. Some, most prominently the pseudonymous blogger ""Bitfinexed,"" have gone as far as to claim that USDT has no material basis, and is instead steadily pumped into the marketplace to move the price of bitcoin upward.  Speaking to CoinDesk, a Tether representative said, ""The same principals have been involved in both Bitfinex and Tether since the beginning – that has never been a secret. Suggestions that USDT has no material basis have no merit. Tether is fully backed dollar for dollar.""  In December, a spokesman for Bitfinex and Tether said a forthcoming audit would show that tether tokens were fully backed. The company has also threatened legal action against its online critics.  Similar issues also haunted NuShares after its distribution of the NuBits stablecoin in 2016.  Even though the project set out to maintain the stability of the currency through economic incentives, following a wave of hacks and alleged manipulation of the peg by stakeholders, the stablecoin traded for as low as 10 cents the same year.  At the time, NuBits core developer Jordan Lee blamed the blunders on ""suicidal tendencies"" in the community.  Small numbers, big mistakes?  Similarly cited by critics of the concept is the suspension of trading of BitUSD, what is perhaps the first stablecoin, on the BitShares exchange in 2014 after a security bug was found in the code.  Yet remarkably, in the four years since that happened, BitUSD has mostly maintained its parity – although ""mostly"" is still problematic.  Last week, BitUSD hit $1.10 per coin, according to CoinMarketCap. Small deviations of this type could incentivize traders to take advantage.  Or as Christensen said, ""If you’re buying DAI at slightly lower than one dollar and selling DAI at slightly above one dollar, in a dollar-denominated market, it’s just like a really easy way to essentially arbitrage the inefficiencies of the market.""  However, Christensen said, the tiny price fluctuations these stablecoins appear to have on CoinMarketCap don't translate to the price of the currencies on individual exchanges.  Rather, due to how CoinMarketCap calculates the average price of cryptocurrencies, ""there’s always going to be this volatility effect apparent on the price charts,"" he said.  To him, it doesn't make sense to claim the technology isn't working just because it's seen a few pitfalls, since there are stablecoins operating successfully in the market today.  ""BitUSD is one of the first really good examples of a smart contract or blockchain 2.0 technology actually working really well and in particular, providing real world utility in a way that almost no other blockchain stuff has done before,"" Christensen said.  Crude infrastructure  Still, according to Christensen, discrepancies between CoinMarketCap and the exchanges where DAI is traded weren't at fault for that coin's drop last week.  Rather, those price fluctuations, Christensen speculated, were due to a market-making trading bot gone awol on the Chinese exchange, Bibox. When that market maker went down, another high-frequency trading bot started skewing the price, he suggested. Underscoring his point, DAI traded for $1.10 on another exchange, Gatecoin, the same day it went for 72 cents on Bibox.  And this volatility spooks crypto enthusiasts, who are worried about a potential ""black swan event"" or a ""death spiral."" In such a scenario, the asset a stablecoin is backed by suddenly falls, and in turn pushes the stablecoin down and with it the whole multi-billion dollar crypto market.  But as these technologies advance, stablecoin creators are building in precautions.  For instance, the team behind MakerDAO said it has mitigated the possibility of a death spiral by backing DAI with a diverse array of supporting assets, in an upcoming version of the DAI token to be released this summer.  ""So [a black swan event] is highly theoretical and should only happen in conditions of extreme negligence. And with proper diversification it should, in theory, be possible to prevent with 99.9 percent certainty,"" Christensen told CoinDesk.  And all these instances just seem to display that the technology, and the surrounding crypto infrastructure, is still so new that hiccups should be expected.  ""Really early-stage markets for a new stablecoin are definitely some of the weirdest market conditions,"" Christensen said.  He compared DAI's dip to BitUSD’s price drop following its launch, explaining that before these stablecoins become widely traded on a particular market, they’re vulnerable to bots and bugs.  As Andy Milenius, a developer at MakerDAO, told CoinDesk:  ""When DAI volume is the tens of millions and then it demonstrates volatility, we will have something interesting to talk about.""
