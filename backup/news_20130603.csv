42424920,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX2Ph,1370284326,Butterfly Labs says bulk chip sales to start soon,"Butterfly Labs has announced it will begin selling bulk ASIC chips for bitcoin mining starting this month.  While some Bitcoiners on Butterfly Labs' forum welcomed the news, many others are expressing skepticism or frustration in light of the Kansas-based company's lengthy delays in fulfilling orders for ASIC mining devices.  Butterfly Labs announced late last month that it was starting to ship its ASIC products, which were originally announced in June of 2012.  Following Butterfly Labs' latest announcement about bulk sales of chips, a number of commenters have taken to reddit and the Bitcoin Forum to voice their concerns.  ""They better f...ing ship all of the preorders first,""  wrote redditor a1088245se.  ""Maybe I should have seen this coming,""  noted redditor _nightengale_. ""So they've not yet shipped 1% of products they started accepting payment for 11 months ago, and now they're going to try to flood the market with chips, maybe even before they finish their backlog, who knows?""  Complaints about Butterfly Labs' fulfillment difficulties continue to flow, prompting this response on the company's online forum today:  ""We are waiting on parts is why production is so slow,"" wrote Butterfly Labs' Josh Zerlan. ""As soon as we have all the parts we need, we will be building them. Right now, we have all the parts we need for 5 GH/s miners and we build those as the parts are available. This week should hopefully see tons of parts, hopefully enough to overwhelm the assembly crew. Right now we have more crew than parts ...""  According to its latest announcement, Butterfly Labs will deliver chip orders within about 100 days. It adds that chips must be ordered in minimum lots of 100, with a down payment of 50 percent and the remainder due upon delivery.  The company further noted, ""We will allow you to convert current orders with us into chip orders if you would rather design your own.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/03/butterfly-labs-says-bulk-chip-sales-to-start-soon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe271de698c219303cbeea8589f059eb76958099-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424921,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX2Nh,1370282465,Feds Shut Down Bitcoin (And Other Stupid Headlines),"Imagine if you will, an obscure meth lab tucked away in some trailer park in rural North Dakota, with a bunch of vagrants tweaking out at all hours of the day and night – robbing, stealing, pawning, and doing just about anything that they can in order to get another sweet fix. Now, imagine a long-time sting operation finally goes into effect and the feds swoop in and arrest everybody involved with the meth production along with all of the collateral users in the area. Upon later investigation they find stacks and stacks of cold hard cash that people used in order to purchase meth. The cash was untraceable, the transactions were clandestine, taking place in back alleys and behind closed doors.  The next day all of the financial blogs and newspapers start spewing out stories.  “Feds Crack Down on The Dollar Bill”  “Dark Times Ahead for USD – Is This The End?”  “Feds Seek an End to The US Dollar”  Sounds absurd doesn't it? That would never happen, of course. The events of this small little meth lab bust in rural North Dakota has no actual bearings on the United States financial system or its chosen currency. The price of the US dollar will not waver, the stock market will not be shocked, and the value of the dollar as a whole will not be lowered because of such an arbitrary and typical occurrence.  People know and understand that criminals use the US dollar for transactions and they do so without government oversight. There are gigantic money laundering operations and criminal enterprises and everyone is using untraceable cold hard cash – the same fiat currency the rest of us use for completely legal and traceable transactions – and no one sits around postulating as to whether or not this devalues the currency as a whole or whether or not the currency itself encourages anonymous illegal alleyway transactions. To do so would be irresponsible and pointless.  Yet – this type of insane speculation and sweeping idiocy is exactly what happens when any mundane and completely unrelated thing happens regarding Bitcoin. The feds crack down on Dwolla transactions to Mt.Gox? Watch the headlines roll in – it's obviously the end of Bitcoin. Not only that, but it's not an independent, singular form of transaction that has been cracked down on, but it's the entire Bitcoin network that has been halted, or so the scary, ominous headlines would have you think.  The most recent example of this headline hearsay is the Liberty Reserve shutdown. Liberty Reserve is an alternative payment network that was created solely for illegal activities. It ran a $6 billion online money laundering operation peddling stolen identities, child porn, drugs, and everything else you can imagine your friendly neighborhood black market would have on its shelves. The currency of choice for Liberty Reserve and its shadowy users was Bitcoin – the equivalent of online cash, which naturally provides users with the ability to make the internet's version of a back-alley anonymous transaction to some guy selling hot watches and shotguns out of the back of his beat-up Oldsmobile.  The Feds watched Liberty Reserve closely, and they shut it down for good reason. The price of Bitcoin didn't plummet (in fact it jumped up by $10 while the news was being reported) and people didn't stop using it.  Yet, irresponsible sensationalist headlines on behalf of the mainstream media and independent blogs began popping up everywhere spelling the end of Bitcoin. The headlines made it seem as though the Feds had just shut down an entire digital currency (as if that were even possible...which it's not) and that the whole digital currency scam had come to an end. I could practically hear the uneducated naysayers' collective condescending, “I told you so.”  Now, I don't entirely blame the journalists for jumping to such insane conclusions – it's a mix of miseducation on what exactly Bitcoin and cryptocurrency actually is and an insatiable need to stir up fervent community hissy fits. But when the same writers make the same mistake over and over again, one can't help but wonder if they're intentionally trying to spread misinformation, and that's something I have a problem with.  Take this headline from the Washington Post, for example:  ""Feds Shut Down Payment Network Liberty Reserve. Is Bitcoin Next?""  Yes... yes of course it is! Because Bitcoin itself is a singular, centralized institution that someone can just completely shut down (are you picking up my sarcasm?). Why would Timothy B. Lee not check his facts first, or make an effort to understand the very basics of what Bitcoin is? It's a network made up of thousands upon thousands of individuals across the entire globe. A network so vast, in fact, that the governments of the world would have to pool their resources and engineer a Lex Luthor-type plan in order to shut the entire network down. Of course, Timmy does allude to this later in the article, but that's exactly what is so frustrating about these headlines. People tend to graze through information on the internet like a cow in the fields, or an ADHD-afflicted five-year-old who just downed a Red Bull and a plate of fudge, and pounding out misleading headlines like this causes a lot of harm and only helps in perpetuating the already rampant lack of education about what Bitcoin currently is and how it works.  Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of FinCEN, which is the law enforcement branch of the US Department of Treasury, said on Thursday in an interview with American Banker, “FinCEN has been out front in issuing our guidance to make it clear that we see virtual currency as a type of money services business. It's as much part of the financial framework as any other type of financial institution, and it has the same obligations as those financial institutions, the same obligations as any money services business out there. For those that choose to act outside for those obligations and outside of the law, they are going to have to account for that.”  For those of you who are worried about the doom-and-gloom headlines, and for those writers who would keep perpetuating the myth that Bitcoin is somehow subject to a manual shutdown, it's important to understand that, as a whole, the feds are absolutely fine with digital currency, they are working with it. Despite what the news reports say, BTC is more traceable that any back-alley cash transaction ever will be. Digital currency is a good thing, and as long as the government keeps working with Bitcoin, it will only become more legitimate and stable.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,William McCanless,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/03/feds-shut-down-bitcoin-and-other-stupid-headlines,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/853696b2ad84093152e83e9631cbcddbc5feee65-425x300.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424909,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX21h,1370277374,Top 5 Bitcoin Tweets for May 27 to June 2,"It's been an event-filled week in the world of Bitcoin, as you'll know if you've been following the right Twitter accounts. If, however, you have not kept up to speed with the quick-fire social network, we've compiled the five most interesting links from Twitter about the world of Bitcoin.  1. EFF thanks community for 726 Bitcoin donation    Thank you, Bitcoin community, for the 726 BTC donation: eff.org/r.3bS8      — EFF (@EFF) May 31, 2013    As reported by CoinDesk  , the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has lifted its ban on receiving Bitcoin donations. The EFF had briefly accepted Bitcoin donations in 2011, but soon stopped accepting the digital currency. At this point, the 3,505 coins that had been given to the EFF were transferred to the Bitcoin Faucethttp://freebitcoins.appspot.com/, a non-profit organization that gave away a small amount of bitcoins to new users to learn about handling the currency. The Bitcoin Faucet recently closed, and the EFF coincidentally announced it would again start accepting donations in the form of bitcoins.  As a result, Gavin Andresen (who ran the Bitcoin Faucet) returned the remaining 765 Bitcoins to the EFF, with the following statement:  ""I’m satisfied to see these Bitcoins will be used as they were intended – as a donation to support the work of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Bitcoin Faucet was happy to receive the funds, but we are particularly glad to see them used as they were originally intended.""  2. Mapping Global Bitcoin Adoption    TGB's piece on mapping bitcoin adoption featured in @zerohedge bit.ly/18witaR      — The Genesis Block (@TheGenesisBlock) May 28, 2013    The Genesis Block blog tweeted a link to its analysis of global BitCoin adoption. The research involved looking at the following factors: global wallet downloads to show interest by region, exchange volumes in different currencies, where the most mining has been done, which companies are adopting Bitcoin and other interactions between Bitcoin and the real world.  The analysis shows that, while the US is the leading Bitcoin user in terms of client downloads and trading volumes, the Nordic countries have the greatest penetration of Bitcoin use. The research also shows that, while Mt. Gox is the most-used exchange by a large margin, other exchanges such as Btce and Bitstamp are fast catching up.  3. Bitcoin ain't the answer to saving the economy from hyperinflation    ""How do you prevent hyperinflation without destroying the economy? The answer ain’t Bitcoin."" by @someben medium.com/editors-picks/…      — Medium (@Medium) May 30, 2013    A new communal blogging platform called ""Medium"" hosted an academic essay last week on the potential pitfalls of relying on Bitcoin as a cure for hyperinflation. The piece begins by recounting the list of security issues suffered by Mt. Gox and pointing out that the Bitcoin infrastructure lacks the liquidity to be built out into a mature currency.  The essay continues by looking at the deflationary nature of Bitcoin. As we know, Bitcoin has a set limit of 21 million coins, and the cryptographic problems required to mint new coins become increasingly harder. That means as bitcoins increase in value we'll see a deflation as ever-decreasing amounts of bitcoin will be equivalent to a given real-world currency. If you want to read how the author (@someben) explains how the deflationary effect would be ""catastrophic"" for all of us, follow this link to the original article.  4. Australian WikiLeaks Party Courts Controversy over Anonymous Bitcoin Donations    WikiLeaks party flirts with Oz law by taking Bitcoin gifts? | Register theregister.co.uk/2013/05/27/bit… donate: wikileaksparty.org.au/forms/credit-c… #svpol      — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) May 27, 2013    The Register reports  that hopes that Bitcoin may be a way to give the Australian WikiLeaks party some clout in future elections could be dashed by stringent rules on anonymous donations. Bitcoin is inherently anonymous, and so potentially breaches disclosure regulations set forth by the Australian government that state:  "" ... furnish to the Electoral Commission a return, in an approved form, setting out the total amount or value of all gifts, the number of persons who made gifts, and the relevant details of each gift, received by the person during the disclosure period for the election” (emphasis added).""

TechCrunch names CoinBase as most trustworthy consumer Bitcoin brand    Techcrunch: ""@coinbase is becoming the most trustworthy consumer brand in #Bitcoin."" techcrunch.com/2013/05/27/bit…      — Coinbase (@coinbase) May 28, 2013    The last of our tweets comes from TechCrunch, which points out that one of the many benefits of Bitcoin is that there is zero transaction cost. However, its disadvantages include the risk of losing one's wallet and lack of integration with merchant tools.  CoinBase  is looking to solve that problem by providing merchant tools and a cloud-stored digital wallet. It looks like those efforts are finally being taken seriously, as the company has received $5 million from investors, including Fred Wilson, who invested in Twitter.

42424910,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX23h,1370271448,Virginia compliance issue leads FastCash4Bitcoins to suspend service,"Tangible Cryptography says it is suspending new purchases of bitcoins through its FastCash4Bitcoins service while it tries to resolve a compliance issue with the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Posts on both FastCash4Bitcoins and the Bitcoin Forum reported that a complaint had been filed alleging that Tangible Cryptography was operating as an unlicensed money transmitter.

42424941,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX2Xh,1370245568,Bitmessage is the Bitcoin of online communication,"We’ve seen the impact that Bitcoin can have on the future of payments. But money is not the only area that the movement is influencing. Bitmessage is a protocol that implements some of the ideas of Bitcoin into communications.  Given the pressure on technology companies to cooperate with governments regarding services like email, those looking for a private way to communicate could find Bitmessage’s concept quite interesting.  We live in a time where cloud computing has become the norm for our digital services. That means that a lot of our information is actually stored in data centers scattered around the globe. This has provided us with convenience in the form of access to our data from anywhere. At the same time, however, we are losing a sense of control and security over our communications whether it is via chat, email or on social networks.  Enter Bitmessage  Bitmessage is like Bitcoin in that it is a decentralized, peer-to-peer protocol. Unlike using an add-on component for email similar like Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), Bitmessage is a unified system that encrypts every message. The whole point of the platform is to keep your communications secure. And on top of that, it keeps secure the members of the communication: not only is the content of messages protected, but the sender and receiver of those messages is kept secret as well.  According to the official Bitmessage whitepaper, even those who use encryption standards such as PGP find it an overwhelming process. In this way, one can think about Bitmessage as a decentralized email server.  Up until now, the way in which we have used email systems has really not changed much over the years. But then, this idea came along. Bitmessage runs as a client on your computer -- for now, there is not a web-based client.  Like Bitcoin Without the Blockchain  Jonathan Warren, a New York-based developer who authored the Bitmessage whitepaper, says the system has a lot of similarities to Bitcoin: “Bitmessage and Bitcoin share the same message relay mechanism and the same address encoding mechanism but Bitmessage has no blockchain.”  The blockchain is the general ledger that allows the Bitcoin system to validate transactions. Since Bitmessage instead involves exchanging messages, it doesn’t need a ledger … which would actually show the communications between addresses. (Some point to Bitcoin’s ledger as a possible detriment, since one can follow transactions through addresses that appear on the blockchain.)  Instead of such a system, Bitmessage uses math to verify messages, keeping over two days worth of encrypted messages within the distributed system at any given time.  Bitmessage Addresses  To obscure addresses in Bitmessage, the system uses a non-identifiable address that will look very familiar to Bitcoin users. That’s one of the reasons why Bitmessage could become useful: other forms of communications have become so transparent that there’s a need for an alternative with more privacy and security.  Ostensibly, this system works like Bitcoin: transmissions are secure and cannot be fabricated. Messages are encrypted with the public key of the recipient. And a proof-of-work system means that the Bitmessage client must solve a computational problem to send a message. This in theory would prevent one of the major problems with regular email: spam.  Redundant and Distributed  As it stands now, it’s hard to see how Bitmessage would work directly with email. It’s likely that Bitmessage would operate on its own as another service that is ultimately separate from email. That’s probably the point, anyway: if Bitmessage did somehow work with regular email, that would probably defeat its intended purpose.  Because Bitmessage is decentralized, it has the potential to be more redundant than email itself. From time to time, big tech companies have outages that disrupt messaging services like email due to software bugs or other failures. With Bitmessage’s peer-to-peer network, this risk is reduced because it doesn’t rely on just a single provider. Bitmessage makes between 50-100 outgoing and about 8 incoming connections when the client is online.  Hurdles to Adoption  Right now, Bitmessage isn’t easy for the average person to use. There is a native Windows client you must install or, alternatively, you can compile the source code to use it on Linux or Mac OS X. Given that technology usually needs to be very intuitive as a path to popularity, though, someone is going to need to come along to develop a simple iteration of the software.  There can be an easy comparison here between Bitcoin and Bitmessage. The prevalence of web-based wallets and exchanges is certainly providing momentum for Bitcoin. The same could be said of Bitmessage. All it will take is for the developer community to realize the potential that Bitmessage as a system holds – after that, we’re likely to see the creation of easy-to-use tools to support it.  Could There Be Mass Appeal Like Bitcoin?  The regulatory environment of Bitcoin is heating up. The main message that came out of the Bitcoin 2013 conference was that the only way forward was for regulation to be a part of the overall picture. “The people using Bitmessage now are the type of people who were using Bitcoin in 2010,” says Warren. That leads one to question what could happen with Bitmessage, should it take off.  In fact, the concept of Bitmessage might have a lot of appeal. In an environment where governments and businesses alike are incredibly afraid of sensitive information leaks, a technology like Bitmessage might be appealing to them. This is unlike Bitcoin, which potentially poses a threat to organizations with concerns about monetary control.  In The End  To learn more about using Bitmessage, check out the website bitmessage org, which is set up as a wiki, complete with an FAQ. There is also a forum for discussing the Bitmessage platform.  Given the real value that the Bitcoin market has seen develop as the demand for Bitcoins has grown recently, it would seem like Bitmessage is coming along at just the right time.  “I don’t believe that people have yet come to appreciate how useful having a censorship-resistant, authenticated broadcast mechanism can be,” says Warren.  What do you think? Does Bitmessage offer promise? Would you use a decentralized system for digital communication?",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/03/bitmessage-is-the-bitcoin-of-online-communication,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dca7c7a86f34b3c7bf2f83a58717a90274a9999e-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
