42423519,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aWPh,1649977502,First Mover Asia: Taiwan Chip Manufacturer TSMC Remains a Crypto Skeptic; Major Cryptos Decline,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos decline amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.  Insights: Taiwan chip manufacturer has stayed largely out of the crypto mining fray.  Technician's take: BTC's bullish countertrend signals require weekly price closes above $40K.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $39,875 -3.3%  Ether (ETH): 3,017 -3.3%  Top Gainers  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Dogecoin DOGE +1.6% Currency XRP XRP +0.1% Currency  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Solana SOL −4.5% Smart Contract Platform Cardano ADA −4.4% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum Classic ETC −4.2% Smart Contract Platform  Bitcoin and other cryptos plummet  A day after bitcoin and other major cryptos had their best day since the beginning of the month, they were back in the doldrums as Russia escalated its attacks on the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine, spurring new angst among investors about the global economy.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization dipped below $40,000 during Thursday trading and was recently down over 3% for the past 24 hours. Ether was changing hands at about $3,000, down similarly for the same period. Other major cryptos were solidly in the red. SOL and ADA were both recently off more than 4%. DOGE was a rare bright spot, up over 1.5%.  Crypto prices tracked equity markets, which also sank, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq off 2.1% and the S&P 500 down a percentage point as investors continued to shy away from riskier assets.  Meanwhile, economic fallout from Russia's unprovoked invasion continued to mount.  A day after saying that peace talks with Ukraine had reached a dead end, Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged on Thursday that economic sanctions from the U.S. and other countries opposed to Russia's unprovoked aggression were hurting his country's oil and gas industry. European Union countries continued to discuss the possibility of a complete ban on Russian energy products. The price of Brent crude oil, a widely regarded measure of global energy markets, soared past $111, a roughly 40% gain from the start of the year.  Paul Robinson, strategist at news and research website Daily FX, noted in an email that ""contracting price action"" for bitcoin over the first quarter this year ""could continue to make things even choppier in the near term.""  Given the nature of volatility (expanding/contracting) and the fact that this is BTC, volatility is likely to ramp up again as we head towards the middle of the year,"" Robinson wrote.  ""Typically once BTC gets rolling it doesn’t take long to muster a fresh level of market interest,"" he added. ""If we were to see that fail to be the case this time around, then it could mean that BTC is headed for an extended period of sideways price action, or worse.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,392 -1.2%  DJIA: 34,451 -0.3%  Nasdaq: 13,351 -2.1%  Gold: $1,973 -0.1%  Insights  Taiwan chipmaker TSMC does not mention crypto mining in its latest earnings  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) posted another record profit for the quarter, hitting the $7 billion mark on continued strong demand for electronics and gadgets.  But absent from TSMC earnings was talk of mining. On the company’s earnings report for revenue by platform you can find categories like smartphone, high-performance computing, internet-of-things (IoT) and automotive, but nothing about crypto mining.  TSMC tends to be secretive when speaking about its customers. As a pure-play semiconductor foundry, the company has to be agnostic. Its engineers will fabricate chips for the fiercest of competitors, like AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA), so it stays silent on any sort of market commentary.  It wasn’t always this way, though. During the first major bitcoin mining boom of 2017, TSMC specifically called out crypto’s rise and mobile’s decline in a press release for its fourth quarter 2017 earnings.  “Our fourth-quarter business was supported by major mobile product launches and continuing demand for cryptocurrency mining,” said Lora Ho, senior vice president and chief financial officer of TSMC at the time. “Moving into first-quarter 2018, we expect the strong demand for cryptocurrency mining will continue while mobile product seasonality will dampen our business in this quarter. ”  But this being crypto, fortunes fall as quickly as they rise.  As crypto historians know, 2018 was a bear market for crypto, and this was reflected in TSMC’s earnings as the year continued.  By the third quarter, executives were blaming the “further weakening of cryptocurrency mining demand” for missed revenue guidance. By the end of the year, that language had been revised to “a big drop. It's almost a double-digit.”  The 2018 bear market also hit other semiconductor companies hard too. Nvidia said that it had a glut of unsold graphics cards in its inventory, alongside an 18% fall in the company’s stock price shaving $23 billion off its market value, which Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the ""post-crypto hangover.""  Fast forward to 2022 and TSMC is still skeptical about crypto’s long-term viability, especially when it’s also dealing with a period of high demand from other customers. It’s understood that TSMC just doesn’t want to allocate its limited fab capacity to businesses that it considers fairweather friends that fluctuate order volume on seasonality – crypto’s notorious bull and bear markets.  And we haven’t even mentioned Bitmain.  In early 2021, prosecutors in Taiwan charged Bitmain with setting up clandestine front companies to poach engineers from TSMC to help it accelerate the development of new business lines and diversify away from crypto.  Given Taiwan and China’s tense political status, the Taiwanese government does not allow Chinese firms to establish research hubs to develop technology for export to China. Chinese firms are allowed to set up branch offices in Taiwan, but they need to be specifically registered with the government and are closely monitored.  TSMC still allows for Bitmain to fabricate chips in its facilities, but TSMC requires the company to attest that its crypto-mining chips don’t violate any of TSMC’s intellectual property. If Bitmain does, the company will be banned and its chips discarded.  So it’s easy to see why TSMC doesn’t prioritize the crypto industry. The company bet big on crypto during the last bull run, and it was burned when the bear market started. Given the continued demand for semiconductors worldwide, there are also plenty of demand elsewhere.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Neutral, Support at $37K and Resistance at $46K  Bitcoin (BTC) continued to bounce around the $40,000 price level this week, indicating uncertainty among market participants.  The cryptocurrency is down by 8% over the past week and slightly positive over the past 30 days. Most technical indicators are neutral, although short-term buyers could remain active between the $35,000-$37,000 support zone, similar to what occurred earlier this year.  Momentum signals, per the MACD indicator, are positive on the weekly chart and negative on the monthly chart. That suggests a period of rangebound price action could persist, albeit with an average price swing of 20%.  On the weekly chart, the 100-week moving average, currently at $35,388, is an important gauge of trend support. Buyers will need to keep BTC above that level in order to sustain the recovery phase.  Still, there is strong resistance at the 40-week moving average (equivalent to 200-days), which at $46,800.  Further, an upside target at $50,966 was within close distance on March 28, although a pullback unfolded, similar to what occurred in September of last year.  For now, bullish countertrend signals will need to be confirmed with weekly price closes above $40,000.

Saudi Arabian Prince and major Twitter shareholder Alwaheed bin Talad voiced his opposition to Musk’s offer in a tweet, to which Musk responded in kind by asking exactly how much Twitter the Saudis own and questioning the Kingdom's views on freedom of speech.  The Tesla chief also tweeted about the importance of allowing a vote on his bid, reminding ""[the shareholders] own the company, not the board of directors.""  Strike CEO Jack Mallers told CNBC that he supports Musk’s purchase of the company, particularly if it means implementing cryptocurrency into the app. “With the right leadership, Twitter could become a payments business,” said Mallers.  Musk also happened to be speaking today at the TED2022 in Vancouver, where he expressed his desire for less regulation and more protections for freedom of speech.

MicroStrategy has spent $3.97 billion acquiring 129,218 bitcoins for an average of $30,700 apiece, he wrote. With bitcoin trading nearly $10,000 above that, the trade remains well in the green – though not nearly as much as when BTC was touching $69,000 all-time highs.  Saylor’s acquisition strategy has grown increasingly creative. What began as an experiment with excess cash amassed during the coronavirus lockdown has yielded share sales, convertible note offerings and crypto-collateralized loans – all to buy more bitcoin. MicroStrategy is Wall Street’s biggest balance-sheet bitcoin bull, Saylor said.  Thursday’s investor letter shed some light on the quirks of corporate bitcoin buying sprees.  For one, Saylor continues to “personally provide” the executive teams’ liability insurance coverage. MicroStrategy ditched its corporate plan last June because the “novelty” of its bitcoin buying strategy drove rates too high.  Executives’ bonus payouts are influenced in part by their contributions to the bitcoin strategy, the documents said. And MicroStrategy’s four outside directors continue to receive their boardroom fees in bitcoin instead of cash, a rarity in corporate America.  All this at a company with an undisputed king. Michael Saylor holds 68.1% “total voting power” at the company he founded in late 1989.

Concerns about macroeconomic and geopolitical risks continue to linger, which has kept some buyers on the sidelines. For example, during a news conference on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that peace talks with Ukraine have reached a dead end. Putin also pledged that Russia’s “military operation will continue until its full completion.""  Just launched! Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why.  Geopolitical uncertainty is one reason why gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, and oil have been well bid this year. Cryptos and stocks, however, have traded in a choppy price range, reflecting uncertainty among market participants.  BTC struggled to hold above $40,000 on Thursday while ether (ETH) traded around $3,000. Meanwhile, most alternative cryptos (altcoins) underperformed BTC, suggesting a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders. WAVES and LUNA have declined by more than 20% over the past week, compared with a 7% loss in BTC over the same period.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $39739, −3.14%    ●Ether (ETH): $2992, −2.93%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4393, −1.21%    ●Gold: $1975 per troy ounce, −0.29%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.83%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin dominance rangebound  The chart below shows bitcoin's dominance ratio, or BTC's market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market cap. The ratio has been stuck in a year-long range, similar to BTC's price, which reflects neutral sentiment among crypto traders.  Typically, a rise in the dominance ratio indicates a flight to safety, similar to what occurred during the 2018 crypto bear market. Further, BTC declines less than altcoins during times of market stress. The opposite is true during crypto rallies.  From a technical perspective, the dominance ratio is consolidating after a steep decline last year when altcoins such as ETH rallied ahead of BTC. This year, however, altcoins have fallen in and out of favor amid geopolitical and macro risk.  The dominance ratio is still above its 2018 low at 35%, which means alts could have additional room to outperform over the short term, so long as resistance at 47%-49% holds. Still, a breakout above resistance would indicate a risk-off environment.  Profit-taking among whales?  For now, large bitcoin investors, or whales, have started to take profits on price rallies. That could indicate some anxiety among the whales, who typically accumulate on price dips over the long term.  The chart below shows that the number of addresses with a balance of more than 10,000 BTC has decreased substantially over the past week or so.  ""In this period, at least four whales have sold their bitcoin – this may seem insignificant, but each of these addresses has sold more than $400 million worth of bitcoin,"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  ""This is an important metric to look at because whales typically have the power to control the direction of the market,"" Sotiriou wrote.  Smaller whales, or investors holding more than 1,000 BTC, have also taken some profits over the past month. The chart below shows the seven-day moving average of smaller whale balances, which appears to be stabilizing.  Sotiriou is still optimistic for the crypto market over the short term because of extreme negative sentiment among traders. Indeed, the bitcoin Fear & Greed Index reached ""extreme fear"" territory this week, which typically precedes price jumps, albeit with a long lead time that can span several months.

Since the first-ever NFT, Quantum - sold last year for $1.4 million - was minted by Kevin McCoy in 2014, no one would have predicted, even with the clearest of a crystal ball, that the total value of all NFT transactions would significantly increase by 21,350% to more than $17 billion in 2021, from $82.5 million within the last one year from 2020 - 2021. What is NFT? Non-fungible tokens or NFTs as it is mostly called are unique decentralized tokens stored on the blockchain (mostly on the Ethereum blockchain) and cannot be exchanged with something else like fungible tokens like Bitcoin. They are digital versions of physical assets that can be sold and traded on the public blockchain. There are over 5 million NFTs traded daily under different categories. Some of the categories include music, artwork, collectible items/trading cards, sport, fashion, gaming, memes, and more. Last year, the average price of an NFT rose from around $150 to $4,000 as interest in the digital world of art auctions exploded. To paint a more vivid picture of the burgeoning NFT market, 2.4 million NFT were sold on the OpenSea platform alone, the biggest NFT marketplace, in January.

42423544,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2acfh,1649963500,OlympusDAO Co-Founder Doxxed? Lawsuit Claims to Unmask 'Apollo',"A lawsuit filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for Connecticut alleges that co-founders of the OlympusDAO decentralized finance (DeFi) project cheated an early funder out of nearly 4 million in OHM tokens, which are now worth at least $20 million.  In what may be an unprecedented case testing the limits of pseudonymity in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), the lawsuit names a Connecticut resident as the supposed identity behind “Apollo,” one of Olympus’s pseudonymous co-founders.  CoinDesk has not independently verified the identity of the alleged Apollo and has reached out to the individual named in the lawsuit, Daniel Bara, for comment.  What is OlympusDAO?  The Ethereum-based OlympusDAO project has been one of the most talked-about – and most controversial – experiments to enter the world of DeFi in the past year.  The project sought to establish its native OHM token as a digital reserve currency through a mix of memes and game theory, but its price famously tanked 95% this past winter.  The OHM token now sits at $28 according to CoinMarketCap, down from a $1,300 peak in October.  The complainant in the lawsuit filed Thursday, Australia-based investor Jason Liang, says he agreed to promote OlympusDAO and paid $50,000 in DAI (a U.S. dollar-based stablecoin) in a private funding agreement in exchange for 4 million pOHM, a precursor to OHM. According to an Olympus Medium post, investors like Liang were later able to mint 1 OHM in exchange for 1 DAI and 1 pOHM.  In his suit, Liang alleges that after he started selling some of his Olympus tokens, the Olympus team punished him by rendering inoperable the smart contracts enabling him to redeem pOHM for OHM.  Liang says the Olympus team’s ability to meddle with key smart contract functionality undermines claims that the project is decentralized.  According to the lawsuit, the Olympus team also used pseudonymity to protect its members from liability.  Liang alleges that a token purchase agreement (TPA) between him and Olympus stated that money raised in the private funding round would go to a company that didn't actually exist. With the identities of Olympus’s founders a secret, the lack of an officially registered company behind the fundraiser was, according to the lawsuit, designed to make it difficult for an investor like Liang to pursue legal action against the project.  The suit says Liang's legal team identified Apollo by doing a reverse lookup on a phone number Apollo used to call Liang. The name behind the phone number matches one that was signed on the token purchase agreement that Liang originally thought was fictitious.  In an email to CoinDesk, Joseph B. Evans, an attorney for Liang, said: “There is a completely legal and legitimate way to run a DAO. This isn't it. It appears that certain organizations still believe they can avoid liability if their founders and promoters hide behind screen names, social media handles and fictitious entities. My client provided much needed start-up capital to Olympus, and he is entitled to share in its success.”  Is OlympusDAO an ‘honest Ponzi’?  When OlympusDAO was launched last year, the project's unique bonding and staking mechanics promised staggeringly high returns to investors in the realm of 10,000% annual percentage yield (APY). In order for the system to work, OHM holders were encouraged to interact with Olympus’s smart contracts according to a set of game theory principles ""memefied"" by the project’s community.  ""Hodling,"" buying, and staking OHM would theoretically guarantee steady, sky-high returns for the whole community. Selling, like Liang did, was sacrilege.  A flock of vocal critics dismissed OlympusDAO as a Ponzi scheme from its very start, but the DAO still managed to spur an entire “DeFi 2.0” movement – inspiring popular spinoffs like KlimaDAO and WonderlandDAO to jump in with their own high-yield token systems.  As OlympusDAO has grown into one of the most popular projects in decentralized finance, its creators – the pseudonymous “Zeus” and “Apollo” – have remained anonymous (until now, perhaps, in Apollo’s case).  Pseudonymity of a project’s core contributors is not uncommon in the world of DAOs, and it has been framed as a way for a decentralized community to preserve meritocracy.  Liang’s lawsuit suggests there are other reasons why DAO creators might want to hide their identities, and the filing comes a couple of months after the pseudonymous creator of WonderlandDAO, OlympusDAO’s largest spinoff, was unmasked as a well-known convicted felon.  This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Return To Profit Once Again As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC STH SOPR has once more broken past the &apos;one&apos; barrier. The &apos;Spent Output Profit Ratio&apos; (or SOPR in short) is a Bitcoin indicator that tells us whether coins selling right now are selling at a profit or a loss. The metric works by looking at the price history of each coin being sold on the chain to see what price it last moved at. If the last price was less than the current one, then the coin has been sold at a profit. Similarly, a loss is when the current price is lesser. When the value of the Bitcoin SOPR is less than one, it means investors are, on an average, selling at a loss at the moment. On the other hand, ratio values above one imply that the overall market is realizing a profit currently. Related Reading | Can The 600-Day MA Support Line Push Bitcoin Again? A modified version of the indicator shows the profit ratio for only those coins that were held for less than 155 days before being sold.

One of the primary uses of blockchain technology is to validate and track complex multi-step transactions. Although it is best recognized for its function in Bitcoin, blockchain technology is being used in a variety of applications, from monitoring the environmental impact of products to real-time pollution monitoring. There are two main points to consider. Even if we know what to do to slow or stop climate change, we don&apos;t know how to achieve it. We confront a climate-governance crisis at the same time. The 2015 Paris Agreement marked a historic turning point for global climate action. The pace of climate change has slowed a bit, but it is still expected to rise over the previously agreed-upon thresholds. It&apos;s time to come up with fresh ideas and push nations who aren&apos;t following the Paris Agreement to account. Things get a lot simpler when blockchain is included in the arsenal of tools used to address climate change. How, then, can this be done? Going Green with Smart Contracts Until recently, the inability of blockchains to interact effectively with real-world data, particularly environmental data, impeded the creation of green smart contracts.

42421200,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIij,1649961076,"Sam Bankman-Fried: The Man, the Hair, the Vision","He might now be a billionaire but Samuel Bankman-Fried still has that wild puff of hair. It’s hair that screams “just rolled out of bed.” Or a beanbag chair. “I’m up to something like 50%, in terms of sleeping on beds,” Bankman-Fried tells CoinDesk.  The 50% is a big deal. Beds were once a luxury that Bankman-Fried couldn’t afford. Only a year ago, the former trader spent most nights sleeping under his desk in Hong Kong while launching a then-obscure trading firm. (I called him once at 3:30 a.m. Hong Kong time. He was at the office and happily took my call.) Most Americans had never heard of FTX. Even most bitcoiners had never heard of FTX, an exchange that – at the time – focused on professional trading products like derivatives.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more. The interview originally appeared in the 2021 Most Influential series.  Fast forward one year.  The Miami Heat now play in the FTX Arena. Quarterback Tom Brady and wife Gisele Bündchen star in FTX commercials. During the World Series, you couldn’t miss the FTX signs behind home plate, the countless FTX commercials or the FTX patches on the baseball umpires’ uniforms. FTX became “the official cryptocurrency exchange” of Major League Baseball, as if baseball has used a crypto exchange since the days of Mickey Mantle.  Flush off a $420 million round of fundraising, FTX is now worth an estimated $25 billion, and Bankman-Fried – not yet 30 – is one of the richest and most powerful people on the planet.  That doesn’t seem to have changed the man. He still eats “when it seems appropriate for the given day,” which sometimes means 3 p.m., sometimes 3 a.m. He remains a vegan for humanitarian reasons (“it’s all for animal welfare”), and he still reaches for his beloved Oreos, “one of nature’s more surprising vegan foods.”  And he’s laser-focused on regulation. Earlier in the year, Bankman-Fried spent five hours a day personally dealing with regulatory issues, and he expects regulation to loom over 2022. “It’s a messy world, and there are 195 countries out there,” he says. “Each one is separately exploring what their regulatory framework will look like. We’re trying to stay abreast of all of them.”  Regulation is what drove FTX to move its headquarters from Hong Kong to the Bahamas, because Bankman-Fried says the islands “have a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto, and very few countries have that.”  Bankman-Fried sees over-regulation as the biggest risk to bitcoin (BTC). He views a “hard ban” as unlikely but acknowledges risk in a “soft ban.”  “If we saw coordinated action of restricting access to cryptocurrency projects in the United States and the European Union, that could have a materially bad impact on the market,” the FTX CEO says.  As for regulation in 2022? Bankman-Fried predicts there will “almost certainly” be some type of stablecoin regulation because there’s “a lot of noise around it, and there’s a lot of will for it,” such as periodic audits of what’s backing the tokens. That could have merit. Like the Winklevoss twins, Bankman-Fried views regulation in the U.S. as inevitable and even useful, telling CNN that “the strongest version of the crypto industry is one that does have regulatory oversight.”  Some risks to bitcoin, Bankman-Fried says, have already become less concerning. Exhibit A: the risk of institutional investors fleeing the market. He finds it useful to compare the state of bitcoin today, at the end of 2021, with bitcoin at the end of 2017.  “Going into 2018, there was an enormous amount of excitement,” Bankman-Fried says, as “institutions worldwide were actively trying to decide whether or not to get involved.” Then came the crash. These crypto-curious institutions felt they had dodged a bullet, and they remained on the sidelines. The price of bitcoin languished.  “It ended up taking another two or three years for a number of them to get in,” Bankman-Fried says. He imagines that if a crash had occurred during the summer of 2020, perhaps that would have dissuaded large institutions from entering crypto. But now they are in. The die is cast. “At this point, I think many of them are more committed to it now than they were,” says Bankman-Fried, and he expects more to join the party in 2022. “It would take substantially more negative effects to halt that momentum.”  I was curious what the “negative effects” could mean for FTX itself, particularly given its massive expansion. To the outsider, it seems that FTX spent like a drunken sailor on its advertising spree. And that happened during a throbbing bull run, where everyone looks like a genius. What would happen to FTX if, say, the price of bitcoin plummets?  Bankman-Fried isn’t losing sleep over that, or at least any more sleep than usual. First, and amazingly, he says FTX’s entire endorsement and partnership budget accounts for less than 10% of 2021 revenue, and so it’s “not a huge hit on that front.” If bitcoin crashed to $20,000, theoretically, Bankman-Fried would expect long-term revenue (“or at least medium-term revenue”) to suffer, but he said, “I would be shocked if it went down to a point where we were no longer profitable.”  And even if bitcoin enters a bear market, that fresh round of $420 million gives FTX “a pretty decent firewall of money.” And that firewall could soon become even more “decent” because recent reports indicate that FTX is looking to raise $1.5 billion at a potential valuation of $32 billion.  The son of Stanford Law School professors, Bankman-Fried is a longtime follower of “effective altruism.” That is, trying to make as much money as possible so he can then donate funds in a way that optimizes their impact. In 2020, he performed a rough calculus and determined that his money could serve the greatest good with one simple function: to boot President Donald Trump from the White House. His $5 million donation to the Joe Biden campaign, making him one of the largest donors, is unusual in the libertarian-heavy world of crypto.  “I have given to some Republicans, I’ve given to some Democrats,” Bankman-Fried says diplomatically, then immediately clarifies that “I’ve given more to Democrats at this point.” He cares more about policy than party fealty.  Bankman-Fried seemed appalled, for example, by the Democrats’ proposed tax on billionaires, telling the New York Times’ DealBook, “I think this could cause hugely negative collateral damage, significantly reducing the amount of innovation and taxable base in the first place.”  As for 2024? “It’s hard for me to have a great prediction of that, without knowing who the candidates are going to end up being,” which, intentionally or not, is an almost hilarious low-key swipe at Biden.  Besides, 2024 is a lifetime away, especially in crypto years. By then, we’ll be celebrating New Year’s Eve in midtown Manhattan at the FTX Times Square, we’ll buy our holiday gifts using the FTX cash app and little kids will hope that Santa brings them gifts from the FTX North Pole.  That is all in play.

That suggests a period of rangebound price action could persist, albeit with an average price swing of 20%.

42423538,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2acTh,1649959169,Bybit Replaces CME as No. 2 Bitcoin Futures Exchange by Open Interest,"Bybit, a cryptocurrency exchange with more than 2 million registered users, has overtaken the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as the second-largest bitcoin futures exchange by open interest (OI), according to data from Skew.  Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as options or futures held by market participants at the end of a day. Open interest measures the total level of activity in the futures market.  Bybit now has $2.48 billion in BTC futures open interest, whereas CME has $2.3 billion, according to Skew. Binance is still No. 1.  “Both retail and institutional investors tend to choose Bybit for its high liquidity, low spread and outstanding reliability when the battle between longs and shorts heat up,” a Bybit representative wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  More leverage, more risk  Mike Schwitalla, a senior trader at Crypto Finance AG, said one reason Bybit surpassed CME is that Bybit’s leverage limits are much higher than CME's.  Matthew Dibb, Stack Funds' co-founder and chief operating officer, said that Bybit has become the go-to venue for high leverage trading of bitcoin futures.  “When Bybit's OI is increasing, it generally means that retail traders are using heavy margin to directionally trade,” Dibb said in an interview with CoinDesk.  “The other side of this is that in the event that there is a substantial liquidation day, Bybit usually has the highest number of traders and value liquidations of any exchange,” he added.  Buffeted by speculation – and possibly a few hot trades  Joshua Lim, head of derivatives trading at Genesis Global Trading, said there’s been a lot of speculation among traders over Bybit flipping CME in terms of open interest. (Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  There was a large spike in BTC September futures that occurred on April 7, which has been unwound, according to Lim.  Open interest on the September futures got as high as $1.9 billion, but now sits at $677 million.  “Some traders were speculating that it was related to an exchange update that was rolled out to algo (algorithmic) market makers, and others were speculating that it was related to some kind of basis trade being executed,” Lim said in a Telegram conversation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/14/bybit-replaces-cme-as-no-2-bitcoin-futures-exchange-by-open-interest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fa255b6896c8115b95afe704d03ed4236fc5458-1200x670.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394229,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaTTt,1649958196,Recapturing the 'Revolution' With a Beatles Muse's NFTs,"She’s been a model, actress, muse and member of the “Fab Eight,” the musicians and wives or girlfriends of The Beatles. Her miniskirts inspired revolutions, and her soft eyes a ballad Frank Sinatra once called “the greatest love song of the past 50 years.” That was over 50 years ago at this point.  What is Pattie Boyd up to now? Minting NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, of course. This Friday, the former model, whose long legs and gapped-tooth smile are potent memories of 1960s style and grace, will auction off a set of her own photography.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  These images have been seen before. Some are a part of Boyd’s first gallery show, “Through the Eye of a Muse,” which traveled from San Francisco to Dublin to Sydney to Almaty, Kazakhstan. The photos provide an intimate look at the life she shared with her first husband, Beatles’ guitarist George Harrison, and later her second husband, his best friend and guitar god Eric Clapton.  It also contains what Boyd claims is the world’s first “selfie,” discovered years after the fact that has gone on to be one of her best-selling photographs.  “Without photographs, I don't think I would remember half the things I experienced,” Boyd told CoinDesk in a video interview. She was dialing in from a sunny room filled with books in England. The owner of Web 3 marketing agency Zebu Digital, Henry Hankin, was next to her on a split screen.  Boyd is not the first photographer or celebrity to sell bits of recent history as NFTs, a sort of crypto wrapping for digital files that gives them a signature, identity and lineage. Nor is she the first musician’s muse to sell a closer look into that world. But she has been turned on to NFTs quicker than most artists of her generation.  She sees the series as “wearing new clothes” and definitely not an artist’s “retrospective.”  “It's a new innovative way of showing [her photographs]. It's a different platform altogether,” she said. “I think [it] might introduce another group of people, as opposed to the people that normally go, to my photographic exhibitions all over the world, which is very nice.”  Buyers of the crypto-based format, which contains both “static” images and “animated” ones, will also receive a print edition and voice recordings of Boyd reminiscing. It’s a way of imbuing a little personality, something kinetic to once celluloid-based images.  Her personal and professional interest in photography followed the market and she hardly ever uses film cameras anymore. “Digital is much quicker, much faster,” she said. “Now there is now a third step ahead, as far as this art form is concerned,” referring to NFTs.  Selling images  In some sense, the rapidly evolving world of NFTs – already filled with socialites including Paris Hilton, celebrated athletes such as quarterback Tom Brady and a range of musicians both new and old – is an echo of the Swinging Sixties Boyd lived through. Crypto is also an industry birsmiched by scammers and false promises.  “Given the fact that Pattie's attached to it, we hope that people will be able to see this is something that is a cut above the cannon fodder that's littering 90% of OpenSea projects,” Hankin said, referring to the largest NFT marketplace.  “In the 1960s, [when I was in my] late teens, early 20s, we wanted to change everything – we had to fight for our freedom, fight for what we thought and what we believed in,” Boyd said. “Out of this battle emerge the most fantastic, creative people in film, cinema, music, art, every area you can think of.”  Crypto, too, is something of a revolution looking to reshape everything from finance to the architecture of the internet – the world is still waiting to see if it’s a flash in the pan.  Boyd’s generation might have done much to collapse conservative social mores, but the wave of individualism that followed yielded to a culture of hustling, professionalization and self-interest. In other words, the baby boomers (now just “boomers”) built many of the systems today’s youth find oppressive.  See also: 'We Blew It.' Douglas Rushkoff's Take on the Future of the Web  “Now, I feel that we're all being crushed, and we're told to be quiet and shut up and apologize. Apologize for being alive almost,” Boyd said. “And now I realize there's this new freedom in NFT, which is completely different.”  Many of the psychonauts of the love generation went on to craft the open internet we know today. For instance, Boyd’s contemporary, John Perry Barlow, was a lyricist for the Grateful Dead and author of a foundational text for both the early web revolution and today’s cryptoratti.  But the open, permissive design of the internet was ultimately captured by just a handful of corporations. The wide-open World Wide Web was replaced with “walled gardens.” Crypto, at its heart, is a return to 1960s permissiveness and the cyberlibertarianism that sprung from it.  At least, that’s what’s said. But they’re selling you something – be it a token or a dream. Boyd, for her part, is characteristically reserved. Her “small collection” is a “little invitation to see how it's enjoyed.”  She may again be joining a revolution, but pushes back against a direct comparison. “That was then, and this is now,” she said.  “But, you know, it still has the same feeling of something new about to emerge,” she said. “I want to touch it. I want to know what it's about.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/04/14/recapturing-the-revolution-with-a-beatles-muses-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ff032511843dc83d4f065e8c327cedd157c3bb46-1696x1236.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Terraform Labs transferred the tokens to a wallet connected to Luna Foundation Guard on Thursday, Terra Finder's publicly accessible blockchain transaction portal shows. Both Terra's official Twitter handle and the transaction details tagged the transfer as a ""gift"" to LFG.  Led by Do Kwon, Terraform Labs is the South Korea-based firm behind the TerraUSD blockchain protocol that hosts UST – the largest algorithmic stablecoin with a market capitalization of $17 billion – and its token pair LUNA.  Singapore-based Luna Foundation Guard was created to support the Terra ecosystem with development grants and to build up a reserve for UST to help maintain its peg. Do Kwon is a member of LFG's council.  The transfer helps prop up LFG's reserves, which now stands at $2.43 billion, according to a data tracker shared by LFG's official Twitter handle, with 69.8% of the reserves being in bitcoin.  The data tracker shows that LFG holds 2.25 million LUNA tokens which is fewer than the 10 million transferred. Terra Finder shows that 7.8 million LUNA token were forwarded to another wallet. Before the transfer, LFG's holding of LUNA stood at 50,000, according to a Twitter post that tracks LFG's reserve and its changes.  When the transaction was executed, Terra's LUNA was trading at $88. It has since slid more than 6% since to $82.  A Terraform Labs representative didn't immediately return a request for comment.  Read more: What Is LUNA and UST?

42411828,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDmU,1649955266,Want to Play Axie Infinity? Here’s What You Need to Know,"If you ask the average gamer what they look for when finding new games to play, thrills, intensity and graphics are often the factors considered most important.  Now that there is the possibility of earning cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) while playing games, there are even more factors to look at. In particular, there is a growing demand for games that can synergize conventional gameplay with an innovative and player-focused economy.  Not many games embody this emerging trope better than Axie Infinity, the Ethereum-based game that brings the popular elements of Pokemon to the blockchain space. The platform quickly rose to prominence in 2021 and, for a while, stood as the gold standard for blockchain-based games.  And although it’s hit some rough patches in 2022 (to say the least), the fact remains that Axie Infinity still stands as one of the most successful crypto game titles in the industry’s short history.  What’s more, there’s even a new free-to-play edition, Axie Infinity: Origin, that’s just been released.  What is Axie Infinity?  Axie Infinity is an online game developed and owned by Sky Mavis, a blockchain development company specializing in creating games with player-owned economies.  The game features many of the card-based components we have come to love in Pokemon, with the key difference being that it integrates the concept of NFTs such that players have complete ownership over and can monetize their in-game assets.  Prior to the launch of the free-to-play version, players were required to purchase three Axies to begin the game from the in-house marketplace. This is where existing players could sell their leveled-up Axies to others and try and make a profit. One Axie – a triple mystic-trait Axie called “Angel” – sold for 300 ETH in late 2020. At today’s prices that equates to more than $930,000.  Axies are NFT-based monsters with unique traits and fighting capabilities. Players must choose their starter Axies carefully if they’re to stand the best chance of beating others.  Players pit their monsters against each other for the chance of winning coins that can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies and, ultimately, fiat currencies.  How does Axie Infinity work?  As mentioned earlier, Axie Infinity’s whole gameplay revolves around the strategic use of Axies’ fighting traits to outduel opponents and, in the process, earn rewards.  You can either play against other players or face off against non-player combatants, called Chimeras. In both cases, you need to acquire three Axies with which you can initiate various strategies all in the hopes of coming out on top. Depending on the type of Axies in your possession, you can execute a series of attack and defense moves.  If you are wondering how battling capabilities are distributed or allocated to Axies, here is a breakdown below:  Axie stats: Axies come with four different stats, namely Health, Morale, Skill and Speed. These stats determine the battle mechanics of Axies as they indicate the degree of damage each Axie can dish out and receive and who gets to make the first move.  Axie classes: Another thing that you ought to have at the back of your mind is that Axies come in nine classes (six are normal and the remaining three are secret classes). The normal classes include Beast, Aquatic, Bird, Bug, Plant and Reptile. The secret classes are Mech, Dawn and Dusk. Certain classes have an edge over others. For instance, Aquatic has more advantages over Beast, Mech and Bug Axies. In contrast, they are weak against Dusk, Plant and Reptile Axies.  Axie body parts: Each Axie has six body parts, including ears, horns, eyes, mouth, back and tail. All, except the ears and eyes, have special battling abilities associated with them.  Smooth Love Potion: Whenever you win a battle, you will receive rewards denominated in Smooth Love Potion (SLP), an Ethereum-based token native to the Axie Infinity ecosystem. These SLP tokens can then be used to breed new Axies.  Axie breeding: You can breed Axies a total of seven times. The first breeding cycle requires the least amount of SLP to initiate, however it increases with each breeding cycle.  Axie genes: When breeding Axies, note that each body part of the parent Axies has dominant, recessive and minor recessive genes that might be passed onto the offspring.  Now that you have a basic understanding of Axies and their traits, it is worth mentioning that there are other tokenized items in the Axie Infinity universe, called Lunacia.  In addition to owning Axies, users can also own plots of land. The exciting bit about this part of the game is that owners can customize and monetize their parcels of land. In essence, you can build things, such as shops, on your land in Axie Infinity and generate passive income from them.  In total, there are 90,601 plots of land in Lunacia. There are also four levels of rarity attached to each plot of land – common, rare, epic and mystic – as well as five types of land that can be owned by players; savanna, forest, arctic, mystic and genesis.  Notably, the creator of Axie Infinity, Sky Mavis, has built and integrated a high-speed sidechain that allows players to avoid the cost and time ineffectiveness of the Ethereum blockchain. With this, Axie Infinity can process transactions executed on its platform almost instantly.  What is AXS?  Axie Infinity is a platform working towards enabling a fully decentralized gaming ecosystem. The goal is to completely hand over the management and governance of Axie Infinity to the players.  To this end, the platform launched a governance ERC-20 token called Axie Infinity Shards (AXS). Among other things, the holders of AXS tokens are elevated to the position of decision-makers and are allowed to vote on operational changes and future developments.  However, this is a work in progress. For now, Sky Mavis still has control over sensitive processes and systems. That said, AXS can also be staked to earn rewards.  The SLP price crash and Ronin attack  The lucrative nature of Axie Infinity, especially the income earned from the emission of SLP, has helped propel the popularity of the game, with the Philippines accounting for a significant percentage of its user base.  Interestingly, those living in developing countries saw an opportunity to earn an income much higher than their national minimum wage by playing Axie Infinity, with some going as far as to make it a full-time job.  But it has not always been smooth sailing for Axie Infinity. Skeptics have raised questions surrounding the sustainability of its economy and its reliance on an inflation-prone system. The original reward system and the fact that new users had to shell out cash to start playing the game meant that there was an unending inflow of SLPs and Axies.  Initially, all you need to do to earn SLPs is complete daily quests or battle in the single-player or the Arena mode, or PVP. Since this system guaranteed an influx of SLP, it was no surprise that the value of the token took a hit, which in turn had devastating effects on the value of players’ earnings.  This prompted those at Sky Mavis to restrict the SLP reward system to the PVP game mode. In essence, SLP will only be distributed to players who win matchups. Furthermore, the team opted to burn the SLPs used to breed new Axies, thereby shrinking the supply of the ERC20-based token further.  And just as Axie Infinity was looking to turn the corner, it suffered arguably the largest crypto exploit ever. Axie Infinity relied on a sidechain, called the Ronin network, for its transactions and this system had loopholes that hackers eventually took advantage of.  For one, Ronin required the inputs of nine validators with a minimum of five validators to process transactions. This is unlike what exists in the Ethereum ecosystem, where thousands of validators are constantly engaged to keep the system resistant against attacks.  Read more: What Is a 51% Attack?  “The attacker used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals,” the Ronin Network team announced in their official report published on March 29 – a week after the attack took place. This enabled the hacker to gain control over five validator nodes and via two separate withdrawals steal 173,600 ether and over 25.5 million USDC tokens worth more than $625 million in total at the time.  Following this attack, Sky Mavis has vowed to refund affected users. The company has also increased the number of validators on the Ronin Network so that 10 out of 11 nodes are required to sign off on transactions and discussed introducing a circuit breaker system to prevent this type of attack on the network going forward.  Axies Infinity: Origin  One of the many updates and developments that Sky Mavis has implemented in 2022 is the launch of Axie Infinity: Origin.  Unlike the classic Axie Infinity game, this version does not require users to buy Axies before they can play. New players receive a team of starter Axies for free. With this, you can start exploring the Axie Infinity universe without paying a dime or connecting a Ronin wallet. The team believes that this will open the game up to more gamers and eventually encourage them to take a step further to try the play-to-earn version.

42423551,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2acrh,1649954663,US Officials Tie North Korea’s ‘Lazarus’ Hackers to $625M Crypto Theft,"The U.S. Treasury Department alleged that North Korean hacking group Lazarus is tied to a more than $600 million theft of cryptocurrency from the Axie Infinity-linked Ronin bridge.  The Treasury Department added an Ethereum address to its sanctions list on Thursday. Wallet profiler Nansen had labeled the sanctioned address as a “Ronin Bridge Exploiter” when checked by CoinDesk Thursday. It held 148,000 ETH at publication time. CoinDesk independently confirmed that the wallet is tied to the Ronin exploit.  Crypto analytics firm Chainalysis tweeted that the address “was involved in the Ronin hack.” Tracing firm Elliptic estimated that 14% of the stolen funds had already been laundered by Thursday.  Ronin Network said in a blog post that the FBI had linked Lazarus with the validator breach and that the Treasury Department sanctioned the funds.  “We are still in the process of adding additional security measures before redeploying the Ronin Bridge to mitigate future risk,” the blog said, targeting deployment before month’s end and promising a full post-mortem at a later date.  Ronin – a sidechain that is connected to the main Ethereum blockchain but allows the developers behind play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, Sky Mavis, to support faster and cheaper transactions – was hacked last month, losing 173,600 ETH and 25.5 million USDC, worth $625 million at the time. It ranks among the largest exploits in crypto history.  Thursday’s action is the first time the Treasury's sanctions office has blacklisted an alleged Lazarus-held crypto wallet, a source in the tracing industry told CoinDesk.  A Treasury Department spokesperson said the department had worked with the FBI to investigate the Lazarus Group and Advance Persistent Threat 38 (another North Korean entity believed to use malicious programming to steal funds).  ""Identification of the wallet will make clear to other VC actors, that by transacting with it, they risk exposure to US sanctions. This demonstrates Treasury’s commitment to use all available authorities to disrupt malicious cyber actors and block ill-gotten criminal proceeds,"" the spokesperson said. ""There may be mandatory secondary sanctions requirements on persons who knowingly, directly or indirectly, engage in money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods or currency, bulk cash smuggling, or narcotics trafficking that supports the Government of North Korea or any senior official or person acting for or on behalf of that Government.""  The spokesperson said anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorists were ""critical"" chokepoints in preventing money laundering with stolen funds, and called on the crypto industry to implement these types of safeguards.

42423548,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aclh,1649953670,Oregon Democrat Pitches Campaign NFTs in Crowded House Primary,"Matt West, the former decentralized finance (DeFi) developer-turned-aspiring lawmaker in Oregon’s sixth congressional district, will sell a collection of Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens (NFT) to raise money for his campaign.  The NFTs feature cartoon beavers (Oregon’s state animal) drawn by film poster artist Paul Zeaiter. They range in price and rarity, with the most expensive tiers topping out near $5,800, West, a Democrat, told CoinDesk.  Whether they’ll make a difference in the battle for Oregon's newest congressional district is unclear. Nine Democrats are vying for the party nod in what has become an unexpectedly expensive primary race. One candidate estimated campaigns and political action committees (PAC) will spend $15 million by primary day, May 17.  Plenty of U.S. political candidates have tried NFT fundraising this election cycle in an effort to cash in on trendy digital collectibles. Some have layered complex mechanics while others veered into the absurd.  “There have been a few who have been successful, but generally they aren't treated with respect. They're not necessarily tradable. They're not mintable. You pay for it on credit card and on an alt-chain,” West said, referring to smart contracts blockchains other than Ethereum.  West’s NFT are “absolutely” on Ethereum; they’ll only be available for purchase in ether (ETH). It’s all in keeping with West’s true-to-his roots persona as a developer on the Ethereum-based DeFi protocol Yearn Finance.  “We fought hard to make sure that this is something that would resonate with the community,” West said.  Of course, the Democratic primary in Oregon 6, a new, slightly blue district in the state’s northwest, is composed of a different community entirely. By West’s admission, it's full of voters who don’t really care about crypto policy when issues such as climate change loom large.  Read more: DeFi on the Ballot: Yearn Developer Matt West Is Running for Congress  West’s NFTs live atop the energy-hungry Ethereum blockchain. Asked if this fact could prove to be a campaign liability in a Democratic primary, West said no.  “Ethereum is going to be proof-of-stake very soon,” he said, arguing the switch will cause a “2,000-fold reduction in energy usage.”  The NFTs underscore West’s commitment to “progressive” crypto policies, said Zeaiter, the project’s artist and soon-to-be recipient of their secondary market royalties.  “Regulations are coming, and I’d rather have someone like Matt who knows his stuff” in Washington, D.C., shaping their outcome, he said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Crypto’s presence is being felt in the race for Oregon 6 with or without the West NFTs. Another top contender, Oregon State House Rep.

Now Skynet EGLD Capital, the investment arm of software and consultancy firm Skynet Trading, is committing $40 million to back projects in the Elrond ecosystem.  “The Elrond blockchain architecture has been designed from scratch to evolve beyond the current scaling limitations of, say, Bitcoin or Ethereum,” Elrond co-founder and CEO Beniamin Mincu told CoinDesk in an email, touting the network’s high transaction capacity.  “A fully licensed fund like Skynet can attract institutional capital and provide a new growth path for the Elrond Network,” he added.

Elrond roadmap  Web 3 payments are an important investment area for the Elrond ecosystem following the network’s acquisitions of crypto payments firms Utrust and Twispay, said Mincu. The latter provided Elrond with regulatory approval to issue electronic money in Romania.  “Skynet has deep expertise in DeFi and algorithmic trading and will provide the knowledge and synergies to really build the backbone for Web 3 payments and the new metaverse economy,” he explained.

Jump Crypto led the round with participation from Tiger Global, ParaFi, Sino Global Capital, Polygon Studios and Harmony Foundation, among others.  The EPNS protocol enables on-chain communications with the ability to opt-in for permissionless channel notifications and subscriptions. Instead of using usernames to connect as on Discord or Twitter, EPNS relies on a user’s on-chain identifier. Since launching in January, EPNS says the protocol has powered 4 million notifications sent to more than 44,000 subscribers.  “We have a very aggressive plan to get to a million users,” EPNS founder Harsh Rajat told CoinDesk in an interview.

The protocol is already in testnet on Polygon and plans to launch on BNB Chain, Harmony and an unspecified non-Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain by the end of the year, said Rajat. The company also plans to launch wallet-to-wallet communication in the third quarter.  “A user on any blockchain should be able to receive a notification from any other service they use on any blockchain,” Rajat explained.  “As Web 3 power users, Sino Global Capital faces the difficulty of monitoring numerous DeFi, gaming and governance platforms and proposals,” said Sino Global Capital CEO Matthew Graham in a statement. “EPNS solves a huge pain point for us and fellow Web 3 product users by creating and consolidating notifications into an easy-to-use dashboard with fantastic UI/UX.”  Read more: A16z, Paradigm Lead $150M Round for Ethereum Scaling Solution Optimism at $1.65B Valuation",POSITIVE,BNB | ENS,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | BNB | ENS,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/14/ethereum-push-notification-service-raises-10m-at-131m-valuation,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The upgrade brings interchain accounts, a feature long-awaited by the Cosmos community. These allow blockchains to change data on another supported blockchain.  Other features of the upgrade are updated versions of Cosmos SDK – a developer framework – and the Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, which allows users to transfer crypto assets between supported blockchains.  Interchain accounts allow users to give permission to an application running on one blockchain to perform an action on another. This requires the blockchains to set up a mutual interchain account and be based on either Cosmos SDK or Tendermint, protocols used to replicate and launch blockchain applications.  The feature is a step ahead of IBC, also a Cosmos innovation.  “In a traditional framework, the end-user would log into an interface representing chain A and pass an asset to chain B via an IBC transaction,” Cosmos developers explained in a post. “The user would then be required to log into another interface, this time representing chain B, and complete the remainder of the product flow.”  “With an Interchain-native product model, a user can complete the entire flow within a single, streamlined user experience where chains pass sets of instructions and execute transactions under the hood — all without the user ever having to leave the first interface,” they wrote.  While blockchains are robust and immutable stores of data, they cannot communicate with each other. Networks like Cosmos work on this problem and aim to allow users to access several different blockchains from a single interface.  ATOM, Cosmos’ native token, was up a nominal 1.2% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. The tokens have lost 7% since last week amid a broader market decline.",POSITIVE,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/14/cosmos-gains-interchain-accounts-as-upgrade-kicks-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/322d4007fff4ef01cb35833bba5c45de67041552-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The collection of 1,110 NFTshttps://www.mgmresorts.com/en/entertainment/jabbawockeez-nft.html grants holders access to prime seating at the in-person shows, which run until April 30, as well as added benefits like food and drinks credits, airdropped digital collectibles and meet-and-greet opportunities.  It’s the latest crossover for the Polygon-based ticketing platform and the world of traditional entertainment, with the idea being that NFTs are not only a more secure and fraud-proof way to sell tickets, but can act as a sort of social token for added utility between fans and artists.  “Our product makes perfect sense for Vegas, where every door seems to require some type of access,” Josh Katz, CEO of YellowHeart, told CoinDesk in an interview. “Normally when you walk out of the MGM, it’s all over. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, as they say. But with these tickets, we’re really giving people a collectible to remember the show by, people love the artwork and how it changes after being scanned.”  NFTickets  The company launched its app last October, though the non-fungible ticketing sector still remains in its early stages.  Katz said about 100 YellowHeart tickets have been sold for the show so far, though ticket sales volume for these types of performances are typically concentrated in the final performances.

42410893,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt3Na,1649940600,Will Biden’s Executive Order Smash Barriers to Crypto?,"Financial advisors may soon not only get the regulatory clarity they have asked for about cryptocurrencies and digital asset investing – they may also have a timeline for when it will happen.  Last month, U.S. President Joe Biden issued an executive order, calling for a coordinated effort by federal agencies to research and report on digital assets in 180 days.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.  “I think it’s hugely positive because it takes the conversation from will crypto assets be normalized to how they will be normalized,” said John Sarson, CEO of Sarson Funds, a crypto asset manager and education service. “It removes all doubt that crypto assets will be normalized, and it even gives a timeline for doing so: 180 days. In the next 180 days, we’ll have a framework for crypto normalization.”  A generally positive industry reaction  Sarson was perhaps the most positive out of a seemingly unanimously positive response from people working in the institutional crypto and crypto for advisors market.  Ryan Louvar, legal officer and head of business and legal affairs at asset manager WisdomTree, also praised the aim and tone of the order.  “It didn’t really provide particular clarity, but it did at least start to leave a groundwork for those agencies to work together for a clear digital asset regulation,” Louvar said. “It demonstrates that the U.S. government views digital assets and blockchain each as a significant part of the global economy, which I thought was notable, and it directed a number of government agencies and interagency cooperation in an extensive way.”  The order asked federal agencies to consider crypto as it intersects seven issues: consumer and investor protection, U.S. and global financial stability, illicit finance and national security risks, U.S. leadership in technology and economic competitiveness, access to affordable financial services and supporting responsible technological development.  The good and bad  The executive order may be less important for the content that the agencies are being asked to review, than for how they will conduct their reviews, said Adam Blumberg, co-founder of PlannerDAO and Interaxis, a firm that teaches financial advisors about crypto.  “I like this idea of a coordinated government response and effort among different government agencies, the idea that they need to wrap their arms around these assets and figure out what they are and how they affect all these different aspects of the financial system and how to make them safe for everyone,” Blumberg said. “They need to regulate across different entities and agencies, yes, but they also need to try to do so in a way that is consistent so we don’t have the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] going one way and the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] going another.”  The U.S. now regulates cryptocurrencies in a mostly uncoordinated approach that overlaps several agencies, each with their own definition and treatment of the asset class, all of which lie on top of inconsistent state regulations, Blumberg said.  Although Blumberg is happy to see a presidential order acknowledging the economic importance of digital assets, he also sounded a cautionary tone. Federal agencies are staffed by career civil servants and political appointee, and so the outcome of an agency’s research will likely be bent toward some type of political aim and biased to grant more power to an agency.  “Part of the idea of crypto and DeFi (decentralized finance) is taking some of the financial power out of the hands of government. Why would we expect anyone in the government to be saying, 'Yes, we’ve been overdoing it for some time and we need to give up some trust to computer code that can process transactions for us?' ” said Blumberg. “It’s not in the interest of the government or the people employed by the government to do that.”  For advisors and traditional investors, Blumberg sees the executive order as a win, because it should deliver some of the clarity they are looking for. But for some investors deeply invested in the culture around digital assets, decentralization and pseudo-anonymity are popular concepts, and new regulations are likely to be intimidating.  A path to a bitcoin ETF?  For asset managers like WisdomTree, the research required by the executive order may help push the SEC to eventually approve a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, paving the way to more crypto products for advisors and investors.  “One thing we’ve heard quite frequently is that clients are approaching and investing in this space away from the advisory relationship, which undermines advisors’ ability to deliver cohesive holistic advice for their clients,” Louvar said. “One way they’re looking to bridge the gap is through regulated products to provide access, like a spot bitcoin ETF, which we’ve seen in foreign markets, but not in the U.S. I’m not sure whether this framework will speed up approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, but hopefully it will help.”  The timing of the executive order is fortuitous for digital assets industry incumbents, Louvar said. The battle for a bitcoin ETF and other crypto regulatory approvals has allowed the digital assets industry to build its lobbying power.  According to consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, the cryptocurrency industry quadrupled its spending on lobbyists from $2.2 million in 2018 to $9 million in 2021, with the number of lobbyists representing the industry nearly tripling during that same period from 115 to 320.  Of course, that’s a very small fraction of what the traditional finance industry spends on lobbyists, but it speaks to an accelerating engagement effort from a corner of the financial universe not known for wanting to embrace traditional institutions or power structures.  So what comes next?  What the end result of the review will be is as yet unclear. The general consensus seems to be that some form of new regulations will come from the effort, with some industry participants believing that a new government agency dedicated to the asset class will be established.  “I think we probably need an agency dedicated to crypto; this is a new asset class that is not really a commodity, not an equity and not a currency – it shouldn’t be regulated by the CFTC, the SEC or FinCEN,” Sarson said, referring to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.  “It would make sense that it will take a few years and a few iterations before we get there, but it took a long time from 1929 to set up the Adviser Act of 1933 and then the Adviser Act of 1940,” he said.  All told, it’s a sign of a maturing asset class, said Ben Cruikshank, CEO of Flourish, a crypto-for-advisors asset management platform.  “The result will be that crypto increasingly looks like and is treated like other assets, from anti-money laundering and know-your-client to consumer and investor protections,” Cruikshank said. “This applies to advisors trying to take a compliant approach to crypto and making sure vendors are in the regulation-first side of the spectrum. That’s not a deterrent to bringing more advisors into the crypto fold, it’s confirmation that the industry is continuing to mature.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/14/will-bidens-recent-executive-order-smash-barriers-to-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fec1b0add8e1c0b05e5ef5d2d1bc88e3a2083b8-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423530,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2acLh,1649931860,Elon Musk Offers to Buy Twitter to Take Company Private,"Elon Musk, CEO of electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA), offered to buy social media company Twitter (TWTR) for about $43 billion in cash.  The offer of $54.20 a share is a 38% premium over the price of the stock the day before Musk's investment in the company was made public earlier this month, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Musk plans to take the company private in order to ""go through the changes that need to be made,"" he wrote in a text to Twitter Chairman Bret Taylor replicated in the filing.  In late March, Musk criticized the social media platform for failing to adhere to principles of free speech, saying that it serves as ""de facto public town square"" and this failure therefore undermines democracy.  ""I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,"" Musk stated.  Following Musk's filing, Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, tweeted a thread in which he said he would offer $60 a share for the company.  Twitter shares surged more than 12% in premarket trading following the news. They were trading recently up about 6.4% to just under $49.  Twitter plans to hold a town hall meeting with its employees at 5 p.m. Eastern time (21:00 UTC) on Thursday to discuss the Musk's offer to buy the company, Reuters reported, citing a source familiar with the matter.  Musk took a 9.2% stake in Twitter for an estimated $2.89 billion earlier this month, quickly followed by an announcement that he would be joining the company's board of directors. However, CEO Parag Agrawal said a few days later that a board position was no longer on the cards.  ""My offer is my best and final offer, and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,"" Musk said, according to the filing.  Musk's announcements often make ripples in the crypto world because of his well-known interest in the industry. Meme-based crypto dogecoin rose 11% following the news of Musk's initial Twitter investment, and was up about 6% after Thursday's news. The coin is up 5% over the last 24 hours.  Twitter has established itself as a crypto-friendly platform, adding the ability to send tips in bitcoin last September with the facility extended to ether in February.

A breakdown of the local range of $8.5 and a test of the trend line of sellers showed the mood of buyers. And increased trading volumes during the local growth wave on 14 March proved that in addition to the mood, buyers still have strength. The last point that buyers need to do to start the active phase of the CAKE market is to keep the $7.3 mark. Yes, this mark could not stop the fall of the CAKE price on 17 January. However, sellers started having problems with this mark. A lot of effort has been thrown to win this mark - so it is in the interest of a major player in the CAKE market. https://www.tradingview.com/x/dqFQWNg7/ Therefore, when the CAKE price approaches the range of $7.3, buyers will have a favorable opportunity to buy this cryptocurrency and expect a strong growth boost with the first target of $12.9. At this point, the CAKE price has every chance to slow down and try to return to the downward trend. Therefore, the first part of your investment in CAKE should be sold in the range of $12.9. The rest will go to the section of long-term investments, which should be kept up to $19.5. Therefore, May 2022 has every chance to be a hot month in the good sense of the word.

The attack on this range took place within the weekly candle of 28 March and took place at increased volumes. Buyers even managed to break this range for a while. However, the week closed within the liquidity range, which indicates the control of sellers of this mark. Confirmation of these words was the next weekly candle, thanks to which sellers lowered the SUSHI price by more than 20%.

The Brooklyn, N.Y.-headquartered startup is raising $350 million, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the discussions.  A $5.25 billion valuation would place Ava Labs in the upper echelons of most valuable crypto startups in the world, though it would be still some ways behind the likes of Ethereum scaler Polygon, which is worth $20 billion as of its recent funding round, and USDC stablecoin backer Circle, which was valued at $9 billion in February.  Like several other blockchains, Avalanche is looking to draw projects and applications away from the Ethereum blockchain with the promise of high speeds and low transaction fees. Specifically, Avalanche offers ""subnet"" functionality, where application-specific blockchains can be spun up at scale.  Ava Labs didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

42423553,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2ai5h,1649924933,Some Indian Payment Processors Cut Off Local Crypto Exchanges,"CoinSwitch Kuber, one of India’s biggest crypto exchanges, on Tuesday halted all deposits of Indian rupees on its platform in what appears to be a broader trend among the country's crypto trading platforms.  The involuntary step occurred when Kotak Mahindra Bank stopped providing its services for trades, at least four different sources from India's crypto industry and institutions told CoinDesk.  It's not clear yet what was behind the move as Kotak has yet to comment on the matter.  The development is another blow for India's crypto community after stiff new taxes came into effect on April 1. Meanwhile, a ""harsher"" tax on crypto looms. That tax is scheduled to become effective on July 1.  The threat of an additional indirect tax has added to the concerns about the future of crypto in India. An increasing brain drain of talent and entrepreneurs threatens to be further exacerbated by the latest development, and data suggests that the blows on the crypto scene have caused trading volumes to plummet. And there is no sight of regulatory certainty in the form of a crypto-specific bill. Thus, the latest issues appear to threaten the industry's very survival according to analysts.  Payment providers an obstacle  The issues appear to stem from Indian crypto exchanges’ relationships with local payment providers. Payment gateways such as MobiKwik stopped supporting exchanges at the beginning of this month. Multiple industry sources said that was because MobiKwik needed time to comply with the new tax law.  WazirX, India’s biggest crypto exchange, confirmed that MobiKwik pulled out on April 1.  BuyUcoin, another crypto exchange, also said MobiKwik stopped providing its payment services.  “We had MobiKwik as a partner. They were partners for a long time, two to three years time. Now, they temporarily stopped all the services,” said Atulya Bhatt, co-founder and chief marketing officer of BuyUcoin.  MobiKwik didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Coinbase's debacle  Last week, Coinbase (COIN), the world’s largest listed crypto exchange, announced it was starting trading in India with a bit of pomp and circumstance – the launch included Bollywood songs and more.  At a launch event, Coinbase executives touted how easy it would be trade on the Coinbase app with payments for the trades being processed by Unified Payments Interface, or UPI, a widely used payments system in India.  Shortly after the event, however, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the entity that governs UPI, tweeted to clarify that it was “not aware of any crypto exchange using UPI.”  NPCI is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country's central bank, which has taken an anti-crypto stance. In February, T. Rabi Shankar, a deputy governor at the bank, said that “banning cryptocurrency is perhaps the most advisable choice open to India.”  After the NPCI tweet, a Coinbase spokesperson said the company is “experimenting with a number of payment methods.”  “One of these methods is UPI, a simple-to-use and rapid payment system. We are aware of the recent statement published by NPCI regarding the use of UPI by cryptocurrency exchanges. We are committed to working with NPCI and other relevant authorities to ensure we are aligned with local expectations and industry norms,"" the spokesperson added.  Three days after the launch, Coinbase payment services became “temporarily unavailable"" on its app. The exchange didn't issue a new explanation or statement, and it was unclear whether the UPI services were disabled by Coinbase or by UPI itself.  At the moment, Coinbase has no payment option available and therefore all fiat deposit, withdrawal or conversion services have been halted.  “It might have worked better for Coinbase if they avoided using UPI with crypto in the same sentence. Coinbase got a taste of what Indian exchanges have been facing and struggling with since 2018,” said Aditya Singh, a co-founder of Crypto India.  Sidharth Sogani, founder and CEO of crypto research firm Crebaco, said Coinbase did nothing wrong.  ""UPI is a very well structured payment system, the fastest and the world's most used. NPCI should not ask banks to stop providing services to crypto exchanges. Banks themselves don't have any problem with crypto exchanges. The crypto community had won the case in the Supreme Court against RBI. So banking is not a problem, and the same applies to UPI. Since it's a banking interface,"" Sogani said.  In 2020, India's Supreme Court overturned the RBI's ban on crypto in the country.  Problems for CoinSwitch Kuber  On Tuesday, deposit services became unavailable on CoinSwitch Kuber, an exchange in which Coinbase has invested millions.  An industry source not authorized to speak on the matter implied that India’s central bank – which has tried to bar banks from providing crypto exchanges services before – may be quietly influencing payment providers to cut off crypto exchanges.  “No exchange in India is withdrawing payment options voluntarily. Most of them don’t have payment options right now. So, it’s primarily an issue from either NPCI’s end or banks’ end,” said one industry source.  At least three other industry sources made the same allegation, requesting anonymity to speak frankly about a regulator with influence over their firms. Some said they feared this unproven revelation without proof could lead to a further clampdown against the industry and also said acquiring proof is nearly impossible in a situation like this.  ""There has been no fresh Reserve Bank of India directive asking banks to stay away from cryptos. But senior supervisory managers (of RBI) are telling some banks to exercise caution on cryptos till there is regulatory and legal clarity,"" a senior official of another bank told the Economic Times.  Another source closely connected to India’s financial institutions and the government said, “I’ve seen too many big companies going downhill because of going overboard.”  “Bringing UPI into the picture was a big mistake, and so my personal take is that they [Coinbase] went out of their brief and they have been rapped on the knuckles, and that's had a ripple effect,” the source said.  In April 2018, the RBI effectively banned banks through a notification from supporting or engaging in crypto transactions. That lasted until the Supreme Court decision two years ago. Thus, it is unlikely that the RBI or the NPCI, which is governed by the RBI, would release an official edict or statement that would prompt banks and payment gateways to stop providing their services to crypto exchanges.  CoinSwitch Kuber and Coinbase both declined to comment. NPCI didn't return requests for comment.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/14/some-indian-payment-processors-cut-off-local-crypto-exchanges,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42423570,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aiXh,1649919600,EU’s Crypto Activism Gets Mixed Reception at Paris Blockchain Week,"The crypto sector is still reeling from a string of votes in the European Parliament that some warned could prove regulatory overkill, attendees at the Paris Blockchain Week Summit discovered Wednesday.  Recent European Union plans to curb the energy footprint of proof-of-work technology – which some feared could amount to a bitcoin (BTC) ban – failed to get through the European Parliament when voted on in March. But a second, also controversial, anti-money laundering measure did pass and could now become law if governments also sign up.  Under a planned expansion of existing banking measures known as the travel rule, parties facilitating crypto transactions would have to identify participants. EU lawmakers want that to apply even for the smallest payments or those made to unhosted wallets, where the asset is held by a private individual rather than a regulated exchange.  Proponents, including lead lawmaker Assita Kanko, have argued the travel rule will help cut crime, and have previously told CoinDesk it could be a spur for innovation in a sector that prides itself on creativity.  “If the banking sector, that the crypto people think is actually boring and old, is surviving the travel rule … why would the very chic, cool crypto people not be able to do so?” she told CoinDesk shortly after the measure was voted through her committee on March 31. “They could work it out. ... I guess I'm telling them to try.”  But in Paris, some point out that the existing rule, which requires institutions like banks to report any dodgy-looking payments to the authorities, doesn’t work well even in the conventional financial sector – and is even worse suited to blockchain-style tech.  The rules would mean crypto exchange providers must “provide a full report to the authorities … when they see an unhosted wallet is involved, without even considering the threshold,” Hedi Navazan, head of compliance for Crystal Blockchain, told attendees Wednesday.  That would mean the financial intelligence units that gather suspected laundering cases “will be bombarded” with the data known as suspicious activity reports, she said – even though “they already don't have the capacity” to process the copious information they now get from banks.  That chimes with findings by the U.K.’s Law Commission, which complained in June 2019 that “too many low-quality” money laundering reports were sent to the authorities, “undermining the entire process.” Even the EU’s own regulator, the European Banking Authority, has complained of a “tick-box” approach, where financial institutions merely fulfill procedures rather than identifying risks.  The EU’s approach also doesn’t acknowledge that transparent blockchains allow payments to be traced, Navazan said, and could mean exchanges just abandon transactions with unhosted wallets all together.  Read more: I’m Not Anti-Crypto, Says Architect of Controversial EU Money Laundering Proposal  Yet, some have also expressed concerns about much worse effects.  Joshua Ellul, director of the Centre for Distributed Ledger Technology at the University of Malta, told CoinDesk that recent decisions about crypto payments were “malinformed.”  Crypto “is definitely used for this [money laundering] activity just like cash is,” Ellul said in an interview shortly after the European Parliament vote but warned that lawmakers were “rushing to a solution.”  “Stifle it too early, and operators in a space will just move to another area,” he said.  He’s not the first to warn that an industry faced with heavy-handed laws could simply skip the bloc. But others are more upbeat, warning that regulation is inevitable – and that responding constructively to it would at least silence incumbent banks and others skeptical about crypto newcomers.  The EU’s move “might hurt short-term industry, because if someone doesn’t want to give his wallet information and he moves elsewhere, then, yeah, you might suffer,” Michael Amar, co-host of the summit, told CoinDesk.  “But in the end, if you want to be mainstream, it needs to be regulated,” he said. “We know that it needs to be kosher … let’s not give the excuse for the people who don’t want to have the industry.”  Read more: EU Parliament Passes Privacy-Busting Crypto Rules Despite Industry Criticism",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/14/eus-crypto-activism-gets-mixed-reception-at-paris-blockchain-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/071d3645178680c53f209bd2586bea241d155add-3000x1807.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Major cryptocurrencies are all on a downtrend, after breaking past their immediate support levels. Bitcoin was priced below $40k and had declined by 12% over the past week. The global cryptocurrency market cap stood at $1.96 Trillion after a decline of 0.2% over the last 24 hours. Ethereum had witnessed a selling spree in the last week but over the last 24 hours, the coin tried to recover from the grasp of sellers, however, buying pressure is yet to resurface in the market. Recently, Ethereum developers went live with their Mainnet Shadow Fork. Ethereum Price Analysis: Four Hour Chart Ethereum was priced at $3028.86 and the coin has been hovering around the aforementioned price level over the past 48 hours. Immediate resistance for the coin stood at $3085.60 after the coin has been rejected from that level a couple of times in the past few days. Continued rejection from the resistance mark can push Ethereum to trade near the $2839.12 support level. A fall to that level would mean a 6.44% decline. In case the bulls resurface, the coin would aim for the resistance mark at $3391.95 and then at $3609.61. Trading volume was in red which signalled that buyers were less in number at the time of writing.
