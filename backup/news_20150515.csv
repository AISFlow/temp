42398387,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTLDp,1431726951,Factom Partners With Honduras Government on Blockchain Tech Trial,"Decentralized recordkeeping startup Factom has reportedly partnered with the government of Honduras on a new land title registry initiative.  Reuters  reported that the Texas-based company, in partnership with title software firm Epigraph, was working with the Honduran government to develop “a permanent and secure land title record system” using the bitcoin blockchain, the distributed ledger that tracks all bitcoin transactions.  Factom  president Peter Kirby told the publication that discussions with the Honduran government began earlier this year. However, the company first hinted at a partnership earlier this week on its bloghttp://blog.factom.org/post/118735295389/fun-new-things-happening-at-factom, when it said the proof of concept for a land registry tool was ""being evaluated by select governments worldwide"".  The initiative is notable given the Latin American nation's history of land rights abuse. Alleged corruption and mismanagement within the government of Honduras has fueled a conflict over property rights that dates back decades.  Reuters said it was unable to reach any representatives from the Honduran government for comment on the partnership.  The news also coincides with the end of Factom's crowdsale in which it sold 2,278 BTC, or roughly $540,000, in digital tokens called factoids as part of a bid to promote and build a community around its technology.

Launched in April, EntradaFan is a peer-to-peer online ticket marketplace seeking to compete with market leader Ticketek. The announcement follows EntradaFan's decision to accept bitcoin through a partnership with processor BitPagos, an Argentinian bitcoin firm that allows merchants to accept bitcoin as payment and settle fiat purchases in bitcoin.  The news itself comes amid a particularly active time for bitcoin in Argentina, with bitcoin services firm Xapo having recently signed a deal with social network Taringa! and media outlets such as The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times profiling the tech's regional growth.  EntradaFan director Rodrigo Alvarez alluded to what is perhaps bitcoin's growing popularity as a payment method in the region in a statement, adding:  ""We decided to add this new digital currency to our means of payment due to the great acceptance that has been generated.""  The Queen concert, to be held on 25th September, will see former American Idol star Adam Lambert singing vocals for original frontman Freddie Mercury, a position he first took up in 2011.  To be held at GEBA Stadium in Buenos Aires, the date is part of a five-night tour of South America that will see the band headlining the opening night of the famed Brazilian Rock in Rio Festival.

42398385,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTLBr,1431714019,Blocked Bitcoin Websites Back Online After Court Case Win,"A regional Russian court has overturned a decision today that restricted seven bitcoin websites from public access in January.  Russian-language bitcoin news blog BTCsec reported that a city court in Nevyansk had acted improperly by blocking the websites. As a result of the decision, educational and commercial websites including Bitcoin.org, Coinspot.ru and Indacoin.com will now be publicly accessible once again.  Representatives of certain affected websites had previously argued that there are no current laws that prohibit the release of information related to bitcoin or digital currency.  In interview, BTCsec's Ivan Tikhon told CoinDesk that the event, while positive, is unlikely to have a larger effect on the debate surrounding digital currency in Russia, owing largely to a forthcoming bill that would outlaw money surrogates.  ""I do not know how it will affect the opinion of the government or the central bank,"" Tikhon said. ""Bitcoin is not illegal, but this does not mean that everything will start to use it or that law enforcement will not exceed the official authority.""  Tikhon previously appeared in court on 24th April along with a representative from exhibition company Smile Expo, which has previously put on informational conferences centered on bitcoin.  BTCsec reported that a full text of the court hearing will be available in the coming days.

42398381,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTL9t,1431709819,Hong Kong Banks Hit By Bitcoin Ransom Demands,"Two of the largest Hong Kong banks were targeted with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks earlier this week by unknown parties demanding bitcoin ransoms.  Regional newspaper The Standard reported that the Bank of China (Hong Kong) and the Bank of East Asia were hit by the attacks last weekend. A representative for Bank of China confirmed that the attack took place on 9th May, telling CoinDesk:  “With our constant monitoring mechanism and contingency measures in place to ensure the security and operation of the Company's website, our services and customer information have not been affected by the incident. The case was reported to the Hong Kong Police.""  The Bank of East Asia did not respond to requests for comment by press time.  A police spokesperson told The Standard that those behind the attack demanded payment in bitcoin following an initial DDoS attack, during which a website is flooded with significant amounts of fake traffic in order to disrupt access for other users.  The police spokesperson said the threats included promises of future attacks.  The reports come days after the extortion group DD4BC was blamed for a series of DDoS attacks against organizations in Switzerland, New Zealand and Australia, prompting a direct warning by a Swiss government agency.  DD4BC was cited as the source of a wave of attacks against some of the world's largest bitcoin mining pools earlier this year, as well a variety of websites and services related to digital currency.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MINING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/05/15/hong-kong-banks-hit-by-bitcoin-ransom-demands,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5fc55a4e0805bda282113d3430f269c921b27a29-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398390,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTLGm,1431707749,Bitcoin in the Headlines: The Chicken and Egg Debate,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is our weekly look at bitcoin news, analysing media and its impact.    It's the classic philosopher's dilemma, the chicken and egg. Which came first? And how do you make sense of being stuck in that unknowing middle?      For the media and the general public, debates in the bitcoin space are often muddled in the same confusion – 'Can you have the blockchain without bitcoin?' 'Is the protocol safe even if bitcoin businesses are not?' and 'Who made this thing anyway and why can't we ask them?'      Such is the struggle of making sense of a technology that seems to have emerged as a fully formed chicken in the financial barnyard.      But, while it's natural that the media are out for their answers to these questions, this week's reporting illustrates how the search for answers is often betrayed by life's complexity.    Bitcoin or blockchain?  Perhaps bitcoin's biggest chicken-and-egg debate was revived earlier this week following Nasdaq OMX's announcement that it would begin trialing how bitcoin's blockchain could be used to help transform the way shares are sold and traded.  Banks and other international corporations are increasingly willing to adopt 'blockchain technology', while openly dismissing bitcoin. In doing so, they often fail to notice – or admit – the digital currency's co-dependency with its ledger.  In a Wired piece, titled ""Bitcoin May Never Make It to Wall Street, But Its Tech Will"", author Cade Metz, began by citing James Angel, a professor of finance at Georgetown University who compared bitcoin to MySpace.  The comparison to early, but failed, social networks is not new. But, it served to drive home the message that some pundits are not yet convinced that bitcoin is anything more than an inherently flawed first iteration of a distributed public ledger.  Unsurprisingly, this mixed message from Nasdaq was attacked by non-profit bitcoin advocacy group Coin Center, which noted that bitcoin's ledger requires a healthy currency to operate.  Still, Angel spoke about the need for distributed ledger technology to perhaps provide increased privacy, illustrating why there continues to be a drive to discuss ""blockchain technology"" more generally.  The strongest and most widely used distributed ledger today happens to be bitcoin, but many investors, Angel noted, prefer to keep transactions private. As such, attributes might exist that necessitate the rise of other blockchains, or distributed ledgers, he argued.  Bitcoin's supporters, in turn, will have to keep advancing the argument that its ledger is best-suited to become the most widely used.  A treacherous business  Liz Peek, a former Wall Street research analyst and the first woman to become a partner of a Wall Street firm, took a somewhat pessimistic stance on the technology this week.  Detailing bitcoin's flaws in a Fiscal Times piece, she arguably confused the bitcoin protocol's safety with that of the businesses operating with the technology.  Peek is by no means alone in doing so.  Questioning Wall Street's and the government's desire to legitimise the digital currency in the eyes of consumers, Peek wrote:  ""At at time when 'cybersecurity' has become an oxymoron, why is our government joining with Wall Street to greenlight bitcoin? The virtual currency, rocked by serial scandals and failures since its invention in 2008, has taken on new life as financial officials roll out regulations to govern the cyber cash and banks invest in its future.""      She continued: ""By requiring bitcoin exchanges to register and granting them legal status, the government is signalling to users and backers what may prove an unrealistic promise of transparency and security. ... At least, regulators need to affix flashing red warning lights to every bitcoin undertaking: consumers beware.""  Peek's reference to regulation, it soon became clear, followed on from itBit's announcement that it had received a trust company charter.  A timely news story, no doubt, but the misleading information just kept on coming, as Peek continued her crusade against bitcoin, citing a an MIT Technology Review article which said that academics had spotted flaws in Nakamoto's math, enabling ""cheats"", concluding:      ""High risk isn't a completely incorrect definition of bitcoin right now,"" said Peek. ""And yet, not only are regulators lending bitcoin legitimacy, Wall Street heavyweights have virtually guaranteed it.""  In search of Satoshi  Peek's story also referenced the ongoing mystery surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto, the author of the bitcoin white paper, a subject that was further attacked by Nathaniel Popper this week.  Writing for the New York Times, Popper outlined evidence to suggest that Nick Szabo, the noted cryptographer, was quite possibly behind the digital currency's creation.  ""Mr. Szabo is nearly as much of a mystery as Satoshi. But in the course of my reporting I kept turning up new hints that drew me further into the chase"", he noted.  The resulting piece relays a conversation between Popper and Szabo, that while inconclusive, provides an interesting look at the reclusive cryptographic and his continued work in the bitcoin space.  Neither Peek nor Popper are the first to delve into bitcoin's origin's in an attempt to decipher the identity of its mysterious creator – or creators, or to point to the mystery as one of the technology's shortcomings.  Though an intriguing narrative, however, such storytelling may get in the way of the more compelling reality. Propelled by big players like Nasdaq, bitcoin's chicken-and-egg issues are well on their way to an aisle near you.  This report was co-authored by Pete Rizzo.

42398361,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTJUa,1431649873,Xapo Moves to Switzerland Citing Customer Privacy Concerns,"Xapo has officially relocated its corporate headquarters to Zurich, Switzerland, citing the country's long history of neutrality and stability.  The bitcoin services and security firm said the transition was put in motion three months ago at the request of customers, and that now, Xapo's operations in Palo Alto are in the process of being reduced. As part of the transition, Xapo will hire new finance and legal staff in the central European nation while still keeping a small US presence.  In interview, Xapo CEO Wences Casares sought to position the move as one that would appeal to customers who remain worried about oversight of their bitcoin holdings and transactions.  Xapo indicated that its company representatives would now face potential fines and prison time for revealing customer information without consent in all but select circumstances.  Casares told CoinDesk:  ""This is not to facilitate crime, this is to protect privacy. There are some customers that will bring more balances if we do this and there are some customers who have said we will work with you if you do this.""  Casares said that previous attempts by the company to associate with Switzerland were perhaps not enough to encourage these customers. Xapo moved its deep cold storage vault servers to an unspecified location in the European nation in January, but continued to face pressure from customers for more privacy guarantees, Casares said.  ""We decided to do what they had been asking us to do for a while, move our main company to Switzerland and benefit from the safeguards,"" Casares explained.  Commitment to security  While Casares suggested that Xapo was primarily interested in promoting user privacy, he noted that the company must still follow Swiss law. This includes monitoring transactions for potential money laundering, illegal transactions and terrorist financing.  ""If we cannot prove who you are, we won't open an account for you, and if you do anything that looks suspicious, we will report you,"" Casares said.  Still, Casares indicated that Xapo's customers are most often using its accounts primarily for storage and security. He noted that many of its clientele have ""never made a bitcoin payment"", meaning its holdings are primarily long-term bets of high net-worth customers and family offices.  ""Ninety-six percent of the coins that we hold in custody are in the hands of people who are keeping those coins as an investment,"" Casares continued.  The move to Switzerland will not coincide with any significant technical upgrades to Xapo's vault storage offering, which would still utilize security practices such as multisig and offline private key generation.
