Led by Tsinghua x-lab, the innovation incubator at China's Tsinghua University, along with several other educational institutions such as the Peking and Zhejiang universities, the initiative was revealed on Sunday.  Dubbed the Youth Education Chain League (YEC League), the project's vision is to become the opposite of the U.S. Ivy League, in which educational resources are largely limited to the elite, the announcement says.  To do that, the university's innovation center seeks to build a decentralized autonomous organization (or DAO) based on a blockchain protocol, and which universities or research institutions can join as distributed nodes.  The end goal, according to x-lab, is to let participants vote for future development and applications over the platform, while students and faculties could potentially gain access to educational resources from different institutions shared over its distributed ledger.    Though x-lab has not yet disclosed a concrete timeline for the projects development, the initiative marks a major collaborative move by public universities in China as part of their wider push into researching and developing blockchain technologies.    As previously reported by CoinDesk, universities in China have been pursuing blockchain patents since 2015.  In fact, data from the China Intellectual Property Office shows that universities in the country have filed a total of nearly 140 patent applications that relate to blockchain technology over the past three years, covering a wide range of fields.

The report, titled ""New tech on the block,"" examined 50 blockchain use cases within the two sectors – across three general categories of business: consumer, supply chain and payments and contracts – and scoring them for the ""added value"" they could create, as per Deloitte's criteria.  The research identified four areas within retail and CPG where blockchain has the potential to ease pain-points in the industries, including traceability, compliance, flexibility and stakeholder management – with the supply chain use case having the most potential in the short-term.  Deloitte also hones in on more granular-level possibilities for the industries, saying in the report that a ""know your supplier"" solution with which firms can store data on suppliers and execute payments and contracts would be the ""number one opportunity"" for businesses, a company statement says.  Steve Larke, technology consulting partner at Deloitte, sees blockchain technology as the ""next big thing"" for retailers and consumer businesses, with its ability to authenticate, track and record transactions.  However, Larke stressed:  ""It is crucial for decision makers to understand which areas of the value chain will benefit most from the new technology, and how easy it is to implement.""  As the ""age of blockchain"" approaches, firms that do not consider blockchain within their processes, are at ""risk of falling behind competitors,"" he added.  The research studied both the potential impact of blockchain, as well as the complexities involved with implementing the tech within businesses. The report said that companies should look closely at the areas that could benefit most before investing in blockchain.  Larke concluded that the firm expects blockchain technology to achieve widespread, mainstream adoption ""sooner rather than later."" Firms within the retail and CPG industries ""need to act now and plan for future blockchain adoption, or risk being left in the dust.""

The new platform, announced Sunday at a post-event function after the 2018 Guiyang BigData Expo, will be developed in partnership with Yang Jun, co-founder of Meituan, one of the largest group discount apps in China, according to a WeChat post from Chen.  According to China Money Network, the entrepreneur said:  ""Ridehailing is the first time blockchain will be tested on a social application on mass scale.""  Although he did not disclose which blockchain platform would be used to develop the app or how he aims to counter blockchain's scalability issues, Chen's new project is notable given his background in developing applications around the ride-hailing use case.  Founded by Chen in 2012, Kuaidi Dache took off instantly in China to rival another ride hailing app called Didi Chuxing.  Both backed by venture capital and internet giants like Tencent and Alibaba, the two entered a bitter business war, subsidizing prices until they merged in 2014 to become the largest ride hailing app in China, keeping the name Didi Chuxing. The firm later pushed Uber out of China via an acquisition.  Furthermore, Chen's plan to move into the blockchain space is not entirely surprising, since he has been one of the most vocal pro-blockchain investors in China.

Speaking in a discussion at the annual SPIEF conference in St. Petersburg, Bank of Russia deputy governor Olga Skorobogatova said blockchain requires improvements in terms of security and scalability, adding that it is still ""not mature.""

This is mainly due not to the fact that the technology is not mature enough.""  Skorobogatova added that the lack of large-scale adoption is partly due to the fact that enterprise executives do not yet understand the value of the technology.  Still, there are two different areas in which the technology that might be of benefit, she argued, where one is well suited for online operations such as electronic letters of credit – she provided the examples of Ripple and R3's Corda platform – and the other involves working offline and with smart contracts – Ethereum and Hyperledger were cited in this case.

42380726,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zCOB,1527508816,"Amid Chaos, Our Decentralized Future Is Being Built","Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in Consensus Magazine, distributed to attendees of Consensus 2018.      If, during CoinDesk's Consensus conference in May 2017, I'd predicted the crypto and blockchain industry's subsequent experiences, you wouldn't have believed me.  Back then, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) was around $2,400. Six months later, it passed through $10,000 – right when 1,300 investors and financial professionals attended the inaugural Consensus: Invest conference. But that was only a way station to $19,783, an all-time high in mid-December.  This came as the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched bitcoin futures contracts, giving professional entities a vehicle for betting on the cryptocurrency. Come 2018, the entire mood shifted. Bitcoin lost two-thirds of its value in less than four months as regulatory clampdowns in China, South Korea and the U.S. ensued.  Bitcoin was not alone in this volatility, either. In the eleven months following Consensus 2017, $8.3 billion was raised in initial coin offerings, according to CoinDesk's ICO Tracker. At its peak in early January, the market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies and digital tokens listed on coinmarketcap.com surpassed $831 billion, a 900 percent rise from May 2017. As Consensus 2018 wrapped up recently week it was $375 billion.  With all this money being made and lost, and the ""What the hell is going on?"" questions it provoked among the general public, bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology were thrust into the headlines. Suddenly, they were topics of conversation at dinner tables. Mothers were asking their crypto-obsessed teenagers what coin to buy.  And those of us who'd floated around the space for some years were looked upon with intrigue: Are you one of them? A bitcoin billionaire? (For the record, I most decidedly am not.)  This level of public curiosity was totally new. But the market mania wasn't, not for crypto. Ratio-wise, the BPI chart of 2017–2018 looks similar to the 12 months from April 30, 2013, when bitcoin started at $144.30, soared to $1,151.30 on December 4, 2013, and then slid to $445.87 on April 30, 2014, where it more or less stayed for the rest of the year. The same goes for the calendar year 2011, when the price started at 30 cents, peaked at $29.60 on June 8, and then closed the year at $4.25.  I believe we were in a bubble in 2017, but we were also in one in 2013 and in 2011. In those two cases, recovery to higher highs came much sooner than it did for, say, the Nasdaq, which took 15 years to top its dot-com bubble peak of March 2000. The crypto markets may be redefining the nature of investment booms, speeding up the entire process of speculation, correction, retrenchment and recovery.  Under the hood  Price, though, is a distraction. It makes people miss the forest for the trees, overlooking the important innovations on which the investment ideas are supposedly founded. So, we must note that amid all the money mania, big changes were also occurring with the development of crypto technology itself.  In that same 12-month period, the bitcoin community's three-year internecine war, otherwise known as the ""block size debate,"" came to a divisive conclusion with a software hard fork to create bitcoin cash, a new, competing version of bitcoin with a larger block capacity. That left the community that supported the original small-block standard, now known as Bitcoin Core, free to incorporate code changes of its own. Most importantly, the Segregated Witness (SegWit) protocol upgrade was introduced, which streamlined data management and enabled other software improvements.  In particular, SegWit facilitated one of the most exciting cryptocurrency innovations since Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper: the lightning network. Now live on bitcoin, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies but still in its infancy, lightning is an off-chain payment channel solution that promises to significantly increase transaction-processing, enable derivative-like smart contracts, and lower costs.  Not to be outdone, ethereum developers introduced their own scaling initiatives. These included the lightning-inspired Raiden and Plasma, which aimed to enable smart contracts at massive scale. Meanwhile, new projects from Polkadot, Ripple and Cosmos and others sought cross-blockchain interoperability while still more worked on decentralized exchanges for custody-free token trading.  Meanwhile, businesses, NGOs and government agencies launched blockchain projects covering a smorgasbord of use cases. Almost every day a new private or public collaboration was launched for supply chain management, digital identity, land titles, trade finance, commodity exchanges, decentralized electricity or additive manufacturing.  The UN, the IMF and the World Bank set up blockchain labs. Consortia comprising established companies, startups and even state governments and cities were formed to explore open-source standards in energy, climate data, and the internet of things. People everywhere were striving to make blockchain go live.  Many of these ideas are ahead of their time, mostly because the underlying infrastructure, the protocols and programming rules that govern platforms such as bitcoin or ethereum, aren't sufficiently developed for them. That they are being proposed puts pressure on core blockchain developers.  Unlike the mostly academic and publicly funded founders of the internet, who worked for decades in relative obscurity before their work on packet switching and the Transmission Control and internet protocols was ready for the online boom in the nineties, blockchain developers are in the spotlight. The world is already demanding applications while highly speculative crypto markets want returns on their money.  Having hundreds of billions of dollars at stake does not make for an ideal, tranquil environment for testing and developing software.  Still, developers have no choice. Like it or not, the ecosystem is coming together at once rather than in sequence. Programmers and cryptographers are working on cleaner code, designing smarter security solutions and installing faster transaction mechanisms at or on top of the base protocol layer, while established companies and startups are rolling out smartphone products at the higher, application layer.  All this is occurring as day-traders flip in and out of multiple crypto tokens, creating huge, distracting gyrations in the developers' own net worth.  Out of this chaos, order will eventually come. It will partly be forced by regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will set rules and enforce them, hopefully without killing innovation.  Order will also come from the community itself, driven by the demands of the market. We need best practices for token-issuing startups, software audits and other quality assurances, and self-regulating governing bodies to encourage standards, adjudicate disputes and disincentivize wrongdoing.  Welcoming the bubble  Although the hysteria ensures this industry's development won't chart a methodical straight line, the crazed market need not be viewed as a negative phenomenon.  Throughout history, the arrival of transformative technologies has been accompanied by Wild West-like speculation. It happened with electricity, with railroads, and with the internet itself in the 90s.  As the economist Carlota Perez explains, speculation and bubbles are not just a byproduct but are core feature of how new, disruptive technologies are developed, deployed and ultimately incorporated into our economy.  Speculation unlocks cheap capital. Much of it just lines the pockets of early investors in crazy, overvalued proposals such as Pets.com in 1999, but it also funds real, valuable infrastructure.  In the dot-com bubble, money went into physical infrastructure: fiber-optic cable, giant server farms, research into 3G mobile technologies. People lost billions on silly ideas in the nineties but their money also paid for the infrastructure that would underlay internet 2.0 post-bubble. It enabled algorithmic search, cloud computing, smartphones, social media, big data and all the other functionality that have changed our way of life and made a few titans of tech fabulously wealthy and powerful.  What's the equivalent now? The capital unleashed by the crypto bubble isn't funding physical infrastructure but social infrastructure. Token valuations might be out of whack with reality and imply big losses for many. But they're also incentivizing global groups of innovators to come together online, conceive of new decentralized economic models, and codify those ideas in open-source software.  Their startups may fail but their code will be freely available for others to later work with, even more readily and cheaply than the dot-com era fiber helped Google, Facebook and co. in the 2000s.  We don't know what new innovations will emerge, but it's fair to say these early innovators are laying the building blocks of our future, decentralized economy.  The big idea  At times like this, there's a broad understanding that something big is happening. It's just hard to predict its economic impacts. So people throw scattershot money at everything. Inevitably, their bets overshoot and prices decline. That this is going on in crypto is perhaps vindication of the underlying technology's importance.  This raises some fundamental questions: What is the paradigm shift, the big idea that breeds such excitement? Why, after almost ten years is the market assigning $144 billion of value to a digital asset based on a software system that no one controls? What's so special, anyway, about a decentralized, censorship-resistant system of value exchange?  The big, underlying idea, I believe, is that blockchain technology can upend not just the business models of recent decades but a millennia-old societal practice of deep significance to civilization.  Its decentralized structure portends a profound change in ledger-keeping, a dramatic re-imagination of society's methods for tracking and assigning value. It overturns the centralized model installed with the first ledger, the Code of Hammurabi, which was founded around 1754 BC in Babylon.  It's hard to overstate how important ledgers are to our way of life. Without bookkeeping, modern society simply couldn't function. We'd have no idea of who owes what to whom and of how much value to assign to the assets of individuals, companies and entire economies.  It's how we overcome the core challenge of mistrust among strangers, the means by which we reach agreement on sets of facts and make exchanges of value. This is the stuff of civilization. Anything that transforms this function is, by definition, extremely important.  Until now, we've had to rely on centralized ledger keepers, essentially requiring us to trust the say-so of those who control the books. We've assigned regulators and auditors to randomly check their work, but for the most part we are blind to the accuracy of the data, beholden to what the bookkeeper tells us.  This siloed recordkeeping results in a ""cost of trust"" that takes many forms. One is found in financial crises, such as that of 2008, when society lost faith in the ledgers produced by banks such as Lehman Brothers and the Royal Bank of Scotland.  Another is less obvious: the endless work of millions of accountants at businesses around the world, each reconciling their company's books to those of their counterparties. Why? Because they don't trust each other.  Blockchains promise to supplant this centralized approach with a distributed, shared ledger whose updates follow a robust, ongoing consensus in real-time. At any given time, everyone who's with access can know the current state of agreed-to transactions and balances. No more need for weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual reconciliations and audits. The entire rhythm of our financial system could change.  And it's not just financial data. Valuable information of all kinds can be tracked in this decentralized manner. It includes the online data that defines digital identities, titles to assets, and compliance information. It could disintermediate middlemen of all stripes because, by having a decentralized algorithm resolve our mutual mistrust rather than depending on all-knowing centralized ledger-keepers, we can trade directly with each other. When this system is reliably attached to trusted devices in the internet of things, it could even allow for machine-to-machine trade.  Such a transformation points to unimaginable new efficiencies. It could create untold new forms of value. And it could massively disrupt existing businesses and jobs.  These prospects have stirred a hive mind of dreamers and fueled an unprecedented bout of economic speculation. We don't know where it's headed. But we sense something profound is afoot.  Blockchain is a software technology, but its sweeping potential has fostered a giant sideline industry of speculation and ideation. As the technology ""goes live,"" this hurly-burly process of creative innovation and destruction will only intensify.  That's both exciting and daunting, but it poses massive potential payoffs.

42380725,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zCPR,1527503130,Bitcoin Bears In Charge But Indecision Could Spur Rally,"While the odds are still stacked in favor of bitcoin's bears, a level of indecision looks to be creeping in, according to the technical charts.  The cryptocurrency fell to a 6.5-week low of $7,142 on Bitfinex earlier today, having breached the 50-week moving average (MA) support for the first time since 2015.  Amid the continued drop in prices, though, the charts show a doji candle formed yesterday, indicating that the bears may be running out of steam and a short-term rally could be on the cards.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,210 – down 16.58 percent from the last Monday's high of $8,644.  4-hour chart  The pennant breakdown, a bearish continuation pattern, on the 4-hour chart indicates the sell-off from the last Monday's high of $8,644 has resumed and opened the doors to $6,800 (target as per the measured height method: pennant range subtracted from breakout price).  The 50-candle, 100-candle, and 200-candle moving averages (MAs) are aligned in favor of a further drop in prices.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, indicating a short-term bearish setup. A series of lower highs and lower lows also indicates the bears are in control.  The relative strength index (RSI) is holding slightly above 30.00, signaling just enough room for another $200 drop in BTC prices.  Weekly chart  The first weekly close below the 50-week MA in nearly three years only validates the argument that the long-term bull market has ended.  The relative strength index (RSI) has also rolled over in favor of the bears, while the 5-week MA is set to cross the 10-week MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover.  Clearly, BTC is on the defensive, still, there is merit in being cautious as the cryptocurrency created a small doji candle on Sunday (as seen in the daily chart) at the key 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $7,209, indicating bear indecision in the marketplace. Thus, a minor corrective rally could be in the offing if bitcoin posts gain today (bullish doji reversal).  View  BTC looks set to test the psychological support of $7,000. Acceptance below that level would expose the April 1 low of $6,425.  An unexpected close today (as per UTC) above $7,425 (doji candle high) would confirm a short-term bullish doji reversal and allow a minor corrective rally, possibly to $7,800–$8,000.  Only a convincing move above the weekly 50-MA would abort the bearish view. Meanwhile, a break above $9,990 (May 5 high) would imply a bullish reversal.

Intel Seeks to Automate DLT Block Verification,"Software giant Intel is looking to protect a novel way to verify transactions on a distributed ledger.  In a filing released last Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the company outlines a method by which it would partition and update distributed ledgers automatically, with a processor able to independently verify that new blocks are valid and able to be attached to the ledger.  This is distinct from the conventional mining method advanced by blockchains like bitcoin, that rely on a network of competing nodes to verify and record transactions in exchange for rewards.  Notably, the application explains that some of these distributed ledger systems (DLS) could also be blockchains, but makes a distinction between the two related technologies.  According to the application, the physical computers would need to be pre-programmed with certain parameters to define how a block could be validated.  However, discussing the scalability concerns facing blockchains today, the patent application also notes that distributed ledgers may not be the most efficient form of data storage.  It states:  ""Distributed ledgers have inherent scalability issues. When all of the validators in a DLS must have a copy of all transactions, all of the transactions must be broadcast to all of the validators. These broadcasted transactions create a very large number of network messages.""  Since this would create a large number of network messages, a DLS can impose ""significant storage requirements"" and ""may not scale well,"" it adds.

Dubbed the Bo'Ao Blockchain Forum for Asia (not to be confused with the Bo'Ao Forum), the two-day event in Hainan province is co-hosted by a Chinese blockchain and cryptocurrency media firm BiKuai.org and kicked off Monday as scheduled.  Yet within hours of the start, a video emerged on Chinese social networks Weibo and WeChat showing an actor hired by the event organizer mimicking China's most famous leader Mao Zedong in a welcome speech.  The actor, named Xu Guoxiang, said:  ""In the name of Mao Zedong, I'd like to say thank you to all the attendees today ... And I wish the event will be tremendously successful.""  The video immediately went viral across Chinese social networks, although various reports and reposts of the video and event appear to have since been be censored by the state.  As the clip emerged, several Chinese blockchain media companies that were present at the event this morning, such as BTC123 and Jinse Finance, immediately blasted the organizer's conduct as legally questionable. They further called for a boycott of coverage of the event in an effort to eliminate any association with the Mao stunt over fears of a possible government backlash.  In 2007, China's Ministry of Commerce published a rule prohibiting commercial activities from making associations with high-level Chinese leaders, as such, commercial promotion using a leader's image, either directly or via impersonation, is not banned.  Following the wide criticism of the promotion, the event organizer BiKuai issued a statement suggesting that the issue arose due to a lack of communication with the actor prior to the event.  ""The excellent speech made by Xu was largely appreciated by the audience ... and shall only represent his own opinion, not that of the event organizer,"" the statement reads.

42380709,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zC6Z,1527489051,What to Expect When Ethereum Classic Defuses Its 'Difficulty Bomb',"Ethereum classic (ETC) is set to fork in the coming days as part of a bid to diffuse a so-called 'bomb' in its code.  Set for block 5,900,000, the change, in which all users of the original ethereum blockchain will need to update their software, is meant to disable a feature that is designed to increase the difficulty of mining the protocol's rewards ahead of a shift to a new consensus algorithm.  Such changes, originally envisioned as part of the roadmap now continued by the ethereum blockchain, would render ETC mining unprofitable if allowed to persist.  Advocates in the ethereum community argue that proof-of-stake systems are more energy efficient than their proof-of-work counterparts. However, Anthony Lusardi, developer and director of ETC Cooperative, a community development and marketing body for the protocol, argues this is yet another point on which the ethereum and ethereum classic communities disagree.  As such, he sought to frame the impending removal of the code as another way the ethereum classic project is attempting to differentiate since the 2017 split.  ""Proof-of-work seems to be the most decentralized approach currently to achieving consensus from what the majority of the community feels,"" Lusardi said in an interview.  He told CoinDesk:  ""There's a lot of new algorithms being proposed like proof-of-stake, delegated proof-of-stake and byzantine fault tolerance, and within our community we're not convinced that these newer versions of consensus are any more decentralized and we're somewhat afraid that they may be more centralized than say proof-of-work.""  Ethereum classic's decision to uphold its proof-of-work system was not made in haste. In fact, discussions started in 2016 after the collapse of the smart contract-based funding project The DAO, which triggered the original splintering of the ethereum and ethereum classic blockchains.  In January 2017, the ETC community moved to fork their blockchain to delay the bomb to allow for more deliberation time.  ""We didn't know if we were going to move to proof-of-stake or stay with proof-of-work and there were a lot of discussions. We realized we didn't have enough time,"" Igor Artamonov, CTO of the ethereum classic development team, told CoinDesk.  By now, however, proof-of-stake systems have been better explored, Lusardi said.  He contends that proof-of-work systems better resist centralization because mining requires continuous infrastructural investment in hardware. Conversely, once a participant achieves an ""economic majority"" in a proof-of-stake system, he said, ""there doesn't seem to be much to ever stop them from having it.""  Ethereum classic developer Cody Burns agrees. ""The entire premise is that you would put normal money into the system to buy a stake in it, and banks and large institutions have unfair amounts of capital compared to normal participants,"" he said.  ""We would have spent the last four or five years just reinventing the modern financial system that we have now. Same actors, same players,"" he added.  Mass destruction? Unlikely  Hard forks have proven contentious in the past due to the potential for networks to split if miners fail to update their software or if some users decide to keep the network going with old code. But, Lusardi, Artamonov and Burns all said they don't anticipate the upcoming fork to spark any controversy or technical difficulties.  The majority of nodes and miners have already updated their software, which was released three months ago, they said.  Major ethereum classic developer and tech company IOHK has also followed suit. It released its node client Mantis V1.1 three weeks ago with hard fork integration so its users had sufficient time to update, IOHK's ethereum classic community manager, Kevin Lord, told CoinDesk.  ""There have been extensive announcements, discussions and careful review of the proposal,"" he said, adding that the company will ""be keeping a watchful eye on the network.""  However, the developers noted that exchanges could be potentially unaware of the fork, but suggested the risk was small. Nonetheless, Lord said he recommends that users maintain control of their private keys and do not store their tokens on exchanges.  The developers anticipate that the fork will benefit the community, and not only by eliminating the mining difficulties caused by the bomb. The fork is also expected to reduce the amount of time it takes to create a block.  ""Right now we're on 26 second block times on average, so this will take us back down to 14,"" Burns predicted.  Some users may be disappointed with the fork, however, because the network upgrade will not result in an airdrop or the creation of a new coin unlike other types of hard forks.  All in all, the disabling of the bomb will likely pass without much notice, the developers told CoinDesk.  ""We tend to not have very contentious forks,"" Lusardi said.

42380713,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zCBb,1527480046,IHS Markit Has A Plan to Tokenize A $1 Trillion Loan Market,"There's a lot of talk in the financial world these days about putting cash (the fiat kind) on distributed ledgers, but little action beyond proofs-of-concept.  That may soon change as IHS Markit, the market infrastructure giant, is developing a new blockchain-based system to handle the payments leg of syndicated loan trading – and eventually, a wider range of financial transactions. Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, this system of smart contracts and wallets, known as Stax, is designed to eliminate the last mile of wire transfers, where each transaction has its own wire.  If successful, it should cut out the complexity and workload around cash reconciliation between parties in a syndicated loan, which can involve as many as 30 different banks.  Stepping back, the brave new world of digital assets can be broken down into distinct categories. First, there are the native digital assets we all know today, such as bitcoin. For financial players wary of the volatility and other risks of cryptocurrencies, a more alluring possibility is that central banks will decide to issue digital versions of their fiat currencies. But this may take some time to become reality.  In the meantime, a third, more practical approach is to use digital wallets to represent, in token form, some fiat money that has been deposited in a traditional trading account.  Indeed, this is what IHS Markit is doing with Stax, which will begin its testing phase this summer.  John Olesky, a managing director and the head of product management at the London-based company, explained that IHS bank customers will wire money into an old-fashioned account. The deposited amounts are then converted into digital tokens on a private network, and ultimately the digital wallets will allow for the ongoing settlement of transactions.  ""We believe we can settle trades 24 hours a day. So you eliminate those wires and reduce time and effort,"" Olesky told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We don't think that wire system procedures, technology and uptime should be barriers anymore.""  Loans and beyond  By themselves, syndicated loans represent a large and important market (over $1 trillion in issuance annually). A majority of it is settled through IHS Markit's loan solutions platform, which was created in 2007, making it older than the invention of blockchains but a spring chicken by legacy financial system standards.  Unlike in many other DLT use cases, the aim of the new Stax system is not necessarily to make settlement near-instantaneous, just to make it simpler.  According to Olesky, the smart contracts decide when a trade is ready to close and perform the cash settlement, and so the system does not shorten the trade lifecycle. This can take up to 20 days for syndicated loans, which to some extent is deliberate in order to account for primary issuance and secondary trades, varying interest rates kicking in and so on.  ""It's not always about reducing time; for us, it's about reducing work,"" Olesky said. ""If we can take something that involves ten steps down to seven, great.""  Syndicated loans are Olesky's area of financial trading expertise; his previous job was heading up IHS Markit's loan market strategy. But from his perspective as a technologist (he also holds a masters in computer engineering), loans just happen to be the first use case for Stax.  ""We have built this in a generic way and we have already met with exchanges and talked about derivatives and other asset classes,"" he said.  But for Stax to ultimately work with any kind of payment anywhere would involve modifications to the smart contract. For example, it would have to be tweaked to deal with other transactions and conditions, and also how users manage money inside their wallets in terms of how that might be segregated, for example.  Nevertheless, Olesky said the fundamental payment rails of Stax could be applied elsewhere.  ""The rest of the infrastructure will work for any type of payment that is based on the tokenization of fiat. Period,"" he said. ""Take something very natural like a cross-currency swap – well, that's just like a list of cash obligations that you must check against a digital wallet.""  Practicalities  IHS Markit has taken a practical approach with Stax. The network is already in place and the company is not requiring every participant to operate a node; the platform can host nodes for small movers and less tech-savvy players.  Olesky pointed out that most firms do not have a production blockchain or node operating, so this arrangement will be a useful way for many to learn about the technology.  ""We think this is concentrated enough and specific enough that it can be the first time they manage this,"" he said. ""So they will learn about interacting with the technology and then can grow into adjacent items.""  Olesky would not name the big players that would be taking down nodes in the first instance of testing, but a logical candidate is JP Morgan, which also recently tested a $150m Yankee certificate of deposit using tokenized cash on Quorum.  In fact, Olesky's engineers have been building on Quorum and have strong ties with the team working out of JP Morgan. (The bank did not immediately return a call seeking comment.)  Beyond the testing stage, Olesky said it was early to give an exact time for a production version. ""We believe the platform will be ready earlier than a year from now but we think it will be about a year for production launch, including testing,"" he said.  Further down the road, there's one more potential use case. There have been some rumblings of late about how large corporates might use digital tokens internally to move funds around in a frictionless manner, removing the need for currency conversions among other things.  Global insurance firm Allianz recently revealed that it was experimenting with an internal token system to move cash around and remove currency conversions between subsidiaries in different countries, while energy giant BP also said it had been testing internal tokens.  So could the Stax blockchain technology find its way into the payments systems of other large corporate entities? When asked about this, Olesky replied:  ""It's funny you mention that because we do have one of the larger banks in the world inquiring about potentially using our infrastructure to manage their thousands of internal bank accounts.""
