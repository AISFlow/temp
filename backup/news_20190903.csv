Franklin Templeton Investments filed a preliminary prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday for a money market fund whose shares would be recorded on the Stellar Network. The plan requires the SEC's approval.  To be clear: the fund would not invest in any cryptocurrencies or crypto projects. Rather, “the ownership of the Fund’s shares may be maintained and recorded solely on the Stellar network,” the prospectus says.  According to the prospectus, the money fund would seek a $1 per share net asset value (NAV) with 99.5 percent of its investments in government securities, cash, and repurchase agreements further backed by government securities or cash.  Shares would purchasable on the asset manager's online app but not on the secondary market. Minimum purchases start at $20.  The prospectus says Franklin Templeton believes blockchain-based shares provide transparency for shareholders but warns they come with their own risks, including hacking and loss of funds.  As such, the firm cautioned that its Stellar project is a test and the fund is liable to liquidation if decided upon by Franklin Templeton.  With over $700 billion in assets under management, Franklin Templeton, based in San Mateo, California, ranks among the top 35 mutual fund managers.

42403248,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfL5j,1567531801,Human-Trafficking Expert Urges US Congress to Regulate Crypto Miners,"Cryptocurrencies are helping to facilitate human trafficking, and thus should be regulated far more heavily than at present, an expert witness will tell a U.S. Senate subcommittee today.  In written testimony  , David Murray, vice president for product development and services at Financial Integrity Network, recommended that Congress create a new class of regulated financial institutions known as ""virtual asset transaction validators,"" i.e. crypto miners.  These validators would have to know who they are dealing with, just like other financial institutions but very much unlike today’s miners.  ""For these essential actors in cryptocurrency transactions, such a regulatory regime would emphasize counterparty financial institution due diligence,"" Murray said in his remarks to be delivered before a hearing on human trafficking at the Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance (part of the Senate Banking Committee).  ""The lack of systemwide financial crimes compliance (FCC) governance for some existing cryptocurrencies allows criminals space to operate and makes it difficult for the United States to isolate rogue service providers from the U.S. financial system,"" he said.  A former director of the Office of Illicit Finance at the Treasury Department, Murray argued that miners must, at the very least, govern who can participate in networks, and vet any issuers, exchanges or custodians they serve.  Mining is not currently regulated under the Bank Secrecy Act, ""but virtual asset transaction validators could be gatekeepers for virtual asset systems if they are brought into the scope of the BSA,"" said Murray, whose Washington, D.C.-based firm advises financial institutions and governments on combating money laundering.  Again, this would be very different from the current state of affairs in public blockchain networks, which anyone can join without permission. But the openness of such systems makes them useful to criminals, including human traffickers, Murray argued.  ""The trend toward decentralized and autonomous systems threatens our ability to control access to the U.S. financial system,"" he said.  Two other expert witnesses at the subcommittee hearing – Nebraska State Attorney General Douglas Peterson and Nebraska State Senator Julie Slama – also brought up the use of cryptocurrency in human trafficking in their prepared remarks.  Basically a ban  Regulating miners the way Murray described would be tantamount to prohibiting them from participating on public blockchain networks, said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at the Washington-based think tank Coin Center.  ""It’s couched as regulating but what it would be is an effective ban on American persons or businesses using open blockchain networks because it would require them to use it on a permissioned basis,"" Van Valkenburgh told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It’s just a ban on a whole type of technology.""  Murray even seems to acknowledge this in his testimony, which reads, ""Imposing regulations on people and entities who perform these functions almost certainly would make it difficult for some existing implementations of blockchain-based payments to continue operating as they do today.""  However, he adds that the Bank Secrecy Act’s job is not to ""enable or accommodate all manner of financial products and services, regardless of the threat that they pose to financial transparency.""  Van Valkenburgh argued that such a ban would be counterproductive to the goal of nabbing criminals.  ""From a policy standpoint, the fact that this technology has been legal and available has been a boon to law enforcement, because major American companies play a role on these networks like Coinbase and Kraken and [other] exchanges because they ... cooperate with law enforcement,"" he said.  Van Valkenburgh also noted that anonymous payments can have legitimate uses. Cash, for example, while used in private transactions by criminals, is also being used by protestors in Hong Kong who are concerned that the Chinese government might trace their steps on the way to protest sites.  He concluded:  ""The internet is used for all kinds of crime, but if in 1998 we said ‘let’s ban the internet because it’s used for crime,’ the U.S. would have suffered.""

Huobi Global announced Tuesday the launch of the ""Acute Angle"" blockchain phone for $515. The Acute Angle is made by Whole Network, a startup that Huobi invested in. Also announced today, Whole Network's NODE token will be listed on Huobi Prime. Running against competitors like Sirin Labs' $1,000 ""Finney"" phone, the Whole Network device can be purchased with Huobi's native token, HT, for roughly half the price.  Based on Android’s operating system, Acute Angle is currently available in China with a Q4 2019 launch planned for Southeast Asia. Dates for the U.S. and European rollout have not yet been given.  In a statement, Huobi Global CEO Livio Weng said blockchain-based phones have a bright future:  “We think blockchain phones are a promising area for future blockchain industry development. As the industry develops and as innovations like 5G become increasingly integrated into our telecommunications systems, we believe more and more crypto communities will want to trade and transact from mobile devices.”  Acute Angle includes built-in crypto-ready features like push trade notifications, a dapp wallet, an optional cold-wallet plugin and the NODE native token.  Acute Angle is the first in a future lineup of blockchain-based phones from Whole Network, Huobi said, with plans for 5G capability for future phones promised.

42430907,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMychh,1567512030,Ethereum Co-Founder Anthony Di Iorio Steps Down as Decentral CEO,"Billionaire and crypto industry veteran Anthony Di Iorio, founder of the Jaxx wallet-maker Decentral, retired this week to focus on “philanthropic initiatives,” he told CoinDesk.  The ethereum co-founder will continue funding Decentral and approving budgets as chairman of the board. Meanwhile, former product manager Maggie Xu, Di Iorio’s girlfriend of two years, will take the helm as the company’s new CEO.  “If she develops a roadmap, presents it to me, it will be approved depending on which resources she needs,” Di Iorio said. “I’m happy to agree to continue funding [Decentral] if it makes sense.”  Stepping back, in 2018 Di Iorio said the crypto wallet had up to a million monthly users and had processed more than $2 billion worth of crypto swaps through a partnership with ShapeShift. Around this time last year, the company underwent an ambitious campaign to attract paid integrations with service providers, such as loan startups and exchanges, and futuristic office plans with a hologram studio.  But then the bear market hit hard. Transaction fees from the ShapeShift integration were Decentral’s primary revenue flow, Di Iorio said, peaking at $300,000 a month. When ShapeShift started requiring know-your-customer information last fall, revenue dwindled to a pittance. Decentral laid off almost half of its staff, he said, down to the 14 employees it has today.  Decentral is hiring again these days, a few developer positions, because it runs nearly a dozen nodes to ease integrations and data flows across the assets supported in the mobile app. Xu told CoinDesk they’ve finally secured five integration partnerships, including GiftPay and Changelly, which should allow users to convert tokens inside the app and spend them with fiat-denominated gift cards by 2020.  “We need to add the functions people care about, which is being able to buy and sell crypto, convert it to fiat and send it, while meeting other people in the community,” Xu said. “We’re looking to bring back Decentral meetups.”  As a former lawyer and product lead, Xu said her combination of expertise will help make growing and marketing the business more seamless.  Over the next six months, Xu plans to prioritize these integrations and seek funding through “strategic partnerships.” She added the newest version of the mobile wallet, Jaxx Liberty, garnered 250,000 downloads over the past year.  Xu concluded:  “This is about trying to move this whole movement to the mainstream.”  Anthony Di Iorio image via Decentral",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | WALLET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/03/ethereum-co-founder-anthony-di-iorio-steps-down-as-decentral-ceo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/919bb4008e479f4f6ba3836a9a2c9ebc0dac8b74-1024x600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430922,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMyd5h,1567508411,Bitcoin's Total Share of Crypto Market Now Highest Since March 2017,"View  Bitcoin's price recovery from the Aug. 29 low of $9,320 is backed by an uptick in the dominance rate to 30-month highs.  Weak trading volumes, however, indicate the recovery could be short-lived and a fall back to $9,750 could be in the offing in the next day or two. Weekly chart indicators continue to call a bearish move.  A high-volume UTC close above the bearish lower high of $10,956 (Aug. 20 high) is needed to revive the short-term bullish outlook.  A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed for full bull revival.      Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing green at press time, while its share of the cryptocurrency market has reached at 30-month highs above 70 percent.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $10,350 on Bitstamp – up 6 percent on a 24-hour basis – after hitting an eight-day high of $10,506 earlier today. At that level, BTC was up 12.7 percent from the one-month low of $9,320 hit on Aug. 29.  Over the last nine weeks, BTC has consistently found takers in the range of $9,000–$10,000. The resulting recovery rallies, however, ended up creating lower highs – a sign of bull market exhaustion – as seen in the chart below.  The question now is whether the latest recovery from sub-$10,000 levels will invalidate the bearish lower-highs setup with a move above $10,956.  The gains seen in the last four days look sustainable and could be extended further, as BTC’s dominance rate – the cryptocurrency’s share of the total crypto market – has jumped to 70.10 percent, the highest level since March 2017, according to CoinMarketCap.  The gauge stood at 69 percent on Aug. 29, when BTC's price slipped to one-month lows below $9,400.  Many observers consider price gains sustainable if they are backed by a rise in the dominance rate, as discussed last month. The shift indicates money is being poured into BTC for the long haul and not to fund purchases of alternative cryptocurrencies.  Trading volumes, however, tell another story, and suggest the recovery seen in the last four days could be short-lived.  Hourly and daily charts  The green bars (buying volumes) seen in the last four days on the hourly chart (above left) are smaller compared to the red bars (selling volumes) seen during bitcoin's drop to one-month lows on Aug.29.  Buying volumes only ticked up slightly in the 60 minutes to 21:00 UTC yesterday. During that time frame, BTC rose from $10,200 to $10,470. Further, Sunday's green bar (above right) is significantly smaller than those observed during previous breakouts above $10,000 (marked by arrows).  Put simply, the price bounce seen in the last four days lacks substance and a pullback, possibly to $9,750. could be in the offing in the next day or two.  The outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish if prices print a UTC close above $10,956 on high buying volumes. That would open the doors to $12,000.  Weekly chart  The bitcoin bulls have failed four times in the last 10 weeks to secure a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000. Meanwhile, the sellers have failed persistently failed to keep prices below $9,500.  A downside break looks likely, as key indicators have turned bearish, including a bearish crossover of 5- and 10-week moving averages.  The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram has also dropped below zero for the first time since February, while the Chaikin money flow, which incorporates both prices and trading volumes, has slipped to a 4.5-month low of 0.10, a sign of weakening bullish pressures.

42387614,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlvCh,1567506967,"VanEck, SolidX to Offer Bitcoin ETF-Like Product to Institutions","Update (13:15 UTC, Sept. 3 2019): Added details and comment from a press release sent after publication of this article. Further, we've clarified that the product is not a true ETF, although similar.     While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has so far blocked a number of proposed bitcoin ETFs, two firms aim to launch a more limited option this week.  Announced Tuesday, VanEck Securities and SolidX Management – which have previously had a decision on their proposed bitcoin ETF postponed by the SEC – revealed they are taking an unusual route to bypass the regulatory hurdles. The companies will use an SEC exemption that will allow shares in their VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust to be offered to institutions such as hedge funds and banks, but not to retail investors.  Though not in fact a true exchange-traded fund, the product is similar. Ed Lopez, head of ETF product at VanEck, told CoinDesk that the offering ""allows for shares to be created and redeemed like ETFs, but it is not an ETF.""  ""Unlike an ETF it isn’t listed on a national exchange, rather it is quoted on the OTC Link ATS platform. This is a first-of-its-kind type of offering. Given it will trade over-the-counter via broker-to-broker transactions, we’ve been casually referring to it as a Broker Traded Fund, a BTF,"" Lopez said.  The shares are to be sold from Thursday under the SEC’s Rule 144A, which allows privately placed securities to be traded among ""qualified institutional buyers"" with shorter holding periods and without the requirement to register with the SEC.  ""The shares will provide institutional investors access to a physically-backed bitcoin product that is tradeable through traditional and prime brokerage accounts,"" the firms explained in a press release. ""The Shares are the first institutional-quality, cleared product providing exposure to bitcoin and enabling a standard ETF creation-and-redemption process.""  Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital asset strategies at VanEck/MVIS, said;     SolidX is sponsoring the trust, while VanEck is providing ""marketing services,"" according to the release. Further, BNY Mellon has come onboard as the daily fund accountant, administrator and transfer agent. This includes ""facilitating the investor creation and redemption activity.""  Investors are also insured against ""the theft or loss"" of the bitcoin private keys held by the trust, and are provided open-ended creation and redemption of shares, the firms said.  Daniel H. Gallancy, CEO of SolidX, commented:  “As the first bitcoin product in the U.S. with standard ETF creation and redemption and established clearing and settlement processes, institutional investors can finally gain exposure to bitcoin within a familiar context. We view the product as an exciting next step for SolidX and VanEck in our partnership as we work to bring institutional-quality crypto asset products to the marketplace.”  To date, the SEC has not approved any crypto ETF, although SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson said early in 2019 that he believes an ETF proposal will “eventually"" meet the SEC's standards.  On Aug. 12, the SEC delayed decisions on bitcoin ETF proposals by Bitwise Asset Management, VanEck/SolidX and Wilshire Phoenix, all of which hope to become the first to offer a crypto ETF in the U.S. Those decisions are now scheduled for later this month and in October.

Sharma said the bank expects the use of blockchain to facilitate trade transactions to bring the cost of doing business down and usher in speed improvements. The yuan-based letter of credit transaction – involving a shipment of LCD equipment from Hong Kong to China – took just 24 hours, much faster than the normal 5-10 days it takes using the existing paper-based system.  Facilitating blockchain trade in the yuan promises a way into a major market. Based on information from SWIFT, China-related trade produced 1.2 million letters of credit worth $750 billion last year, HSBC said.  In early August, Standard Chartered Bank said it had successfully completed its first international letter of credit transaction on the Voltron platform.
