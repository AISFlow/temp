42426128,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIilDh,1412708497,"Mining Roundup: Pen-and-Paper Mining, ROI Uncertainty and the Latest on Butterfly Labs","Between predictions of a difficulty drop and the recent legal maelstrom surrounding Butterfly Labs, you might think that it was all bad news in the mining community. However, those who have been active in this market segment for long enough know it would take more these events to stop miners from hashing.  Read on to learn more about some of the latest happenings in the bitcoin mining world.  FTC pleased with Butterfly Labs reopening  The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has agreed to allow troubled bitcoin mining hardware company Butterfly Labs to reopen for business, albeit in a limited capacity. The decision will enable shipments to resume and, according to the FTC, set the stage for long-term action against the Missouri-based company.  CoinDesk spoke to FTC lawyer Leah Frazier, who confirmed that a court-appointed receiver remains in control of the company. Further, she explained that Butterfly Labs will take no new orders, and will instead process existing shipment requests.  Frazier told CoinDesk:  “During this time, the company can’t take anymore orders and they are barred from making false representations. Really, they can’t do anything without the receiver. So, from our perspective, we’re very pleased with the outcome.”  Frazier added that the Butterfly Labs leadership could be tasked with providing assistance to the receiver as the representative runs the company, but clarified that the management team will receive no compensation as a result of its work.  When asked about consumer refunds, Frazier said that the company’s assets remain frozen. However, she said that the FTC advocated that Butterfly Labs reopen, in part, to establish channels of communication with customers.  The FTC said its goal going forward is to ensure that everyone who feels they are entitled to a refund can submit a request.  “What we’re trying to do is preserve the status quo so we can achieve the most equitable results for everyone,” Frazier concluded.  Bitcoin mining and power load balancing  Power producers, particularly renewable energy generators, are not unusual in the bitcoin mining sector. Some solar or wind farm owners use excess electricity to power mining ASICs, generate bitcoin and help support the industry as a whole.  A recent post on Bitcoin Talk by author mpfrank suggests that energy producers may benefit from using mining equipment as a load-balancing tool. Theoretically, the user posits, energy producers could use miners to balance the power network.  The post explains that the solution, if implemented correctly, could help solve a pain point for independent energy producers who want to avoid having to pay to either store their excess power or send it elsewhere.  The post reads:  “Renewable power utilities could use their excess power to drive mining hardware, and collect the value of the energy consumed in the process as cryptocurrency. Then, later, when production is lower, and falls below power demand, the saved coins can be used to buy back surplus energy from nearby partners on the grid, or alternatively, to pay for or offset the cost of fuel to produce it locally.”  Subsequent discussion focused on whether the solution would actually make sense from an economic perspective. The author added that the framework makes sense for renewable operators because the variance in day-to-day activity means that electrical output won’t be consistent.  It’s better, the author concluded, to find ways to generate income during the process as best one can – with bitcoin being essentially monetized processing power – instead of paying money to transfer or store excess electricity.  Mining bitcoins – by hand?  Many hobby miners bemoan how it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to generate bitcoins. Thanks to the rise of industrial-scale mining, veteran miners are likely to agree that things aren’t the way they used to be.  But what if you were trying to mine bitcoins by hand? You probably wouldn’t make even one satoshi per day, according to a recent experiment by technology expert and bitcoin enthusiast Ken Shirriff.  Shirriff’s latest experiment involved hashing SHA-256 calculations using pen and paper – effectively solving bitcoin transactions by hand. As shown by the video embedded below, Shirriff writes out each block and works through the process of solving each round. However, he does concede that pencil-and-paper mining “is not at all practical”.  He explains:  “Doing one round of SHA-256 by hand took me 16 minutes, 45 seconds. At this rate, hashing a full Bitcoin block (128 rounds) would take 1.49 days, for a hash rate of 0.67 hashes per day (although I would probably get faster with practice).”  Shirriff also calculated that, power wise, he can’t compete with modern ASICs by a wide margin. He said that his energy costs are 67 quadrillion times that of a mining computer, rendering him less energy efficient compared to an ASIC by a factor of 10 quadrillion.  “It’s clear I’m not going to make my fortune off manual mining,” he joked.  The future of bitcoin mining profitability  The falling price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index – which at press time stood at an average of $327 – has once again raised the question facing miners both great and small: Will mining become unprofitable?  The past few days have shown that while $300 could be the hard floor some called at $400, there’s no indication that the price won’t fall further. This circumstance could create headaches for some miners, especially those who have recently acquired ASICs and are looking for a reasonable ROI. At the same time, should the network start to see significant outflows of hashing power, it’s not out of the question that the difficulty could fall and give small-scale miners some breathing room.  If and when a time comes that the price affects the ability of miners to remain profitable, such a situation would no doubt adversely impact smaller-scale operations more than larger miners. Industrial-scale companies and independent mines would be able to withstand a dropping price given their likely cheaper access to electricity and ability to generate larger amounts of bitcoins.  A recent discussion on Bitcoin Talk saw some predictably passionate responses to the question of whether bitcoin mining will stay profitable. One user took a unique perspective on the matter, saying that it might be worth it for some folks simply for the experience.  The user noted:  “If you weren't mining anything ever before, the only reason to start mining now is to feel how it is. You would later tell some of your children or grandchildren that at some point you were a bitcoin miner in the past. Other than that standard mining is not that good for individuals.”  Ultimately, even those who drop below the profitability line may continue to mine. As holding bitcoins is a speculative action, there are some that will probably hang onto their BTC in hopes of a long-term price increase.

42426119,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIikvh,1412702159,"Airbitz's Touchless Bitcoin Wallet Targets Novices, Evangelists Alike","Airbitz has launched a new version of its mobile digital wallet with added features aimed to help onboard novice bitcoin users.  The company’s mission is to offer a product that will help newcomers understand how bitcoin can be easily used for everyday purchases through features such as a location-based merchant directory, cloud encryption and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) payments.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Airbitz CEO Paul Puey said that the app is designed for bitcoin educators, who he hopes will use it to show others that using and managing a bitcoin wallet – even with functions for added security – doesn't have to be complicated.  Puey said:  “Our intellectual property is to hide the fact that [our wallet] is synchronizing and encrypting data – to make it feel more like online banking.”  Touchless transactions  One of the more popular ways to send bitcoin from one wallet to another has long been QR codes, although some novice consumers struggle to use the payment tools at physical points of sale.  Airbitz is looking to help solve this issue by using touchless BLE technology. For example, the iOS version of Airbitz uses BLE to allow two iPhone users to transact bitcoin wirelessly in close proximity.  While currently only available for the iOS version of the wallet, Airbitz is working on making the feature available for Android devices in the near future.  Spreading the word  Despite its technological advantages, one of the best ways to familiarize new users with digital currency remains word-of-mouth recommendations.  Puey said that when an evangelist gives someone a dollar's worth of bitcoin, he believes they should send it to a mobile wallet like Airbitz that blends strong security features with a friendly interface.  “You have to use a wallet that has backup and encryption,” he said.  To further aid new users, the app also features a location-specific directory to show users where they can find bitcoin-accepting merchants. As soon as a user opens the wallet, it provides a list of all the nearby businesses that accept bitcoin.  A similar feature was also notably part of Blockchain's latest update to its Android wallet, announced in July.  Coins in the cloud  Airbitz’s consumer-focused interface is built upon a backend that employs the latest standards to protect funds stored within the wallet.  The wallet is automatically backed up and can be synced across many devices without any additional work for the user. Cloud encryption of users' data keeps security high throughout the whole process.  “The encryption is top notch for a mobile device, ease of use is there from the get-go and people instantly know where to spend bitcoin,"" Puey said, adding:  “All private keys, metadata and settings are encrypted. It is all backed up to peer-to-peer cloud servers.”  The latest version of Airbitz is available in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.

42426137,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIikhh,1412693685,Bitcoin Foundation to Standardise Bitcoin Symbol and Code Next Year,"The Bitcoin Foundation's Financial Standards Working Group has shed new light on its priorities for the next six months, announcing it will attempt to standardise bitcoin's code, currency symbol and subunits over that period.  The group's formal plan of action follows its first emergence as an unnamed standards committee this June, when a post on the Bitcoin Foundation community forum called for volunteers for the initiative.  The Bitcoin Foundation framed the group as one that will seek to smooth bitcoin's path to mainstream adoption by creating commonly accepted symbols for bitcoin as a currency and ensuring the digital currency's compliance with international standards.  Emphasizing this position, Bitcoin Foundation executive director Jon Matonis said:  “Standardization is an important step towards removing obstacles for mainstream adoption – this is especially true with a technology for financial innovation that is global in reach.""  Goodbye to BTC?  The first task for the foundation will be to apply for ISO 4217 approval, which would lead to an industry-approved bitcoin currency code.  ISO codes are a global standard for banking and business, and compliance would more closely integrate bitcoin, enabling ""more fluid transactions and currency conversions"".  The current code, BTC, does not comply with ISO 4217, which requires the first letter used in global commodities to be 'X'. For example, gold is classified as XAU. Emerging supranational currencies like the euro are also classified with an X, so the precursor to the euro used the XEU code.  The foundation pointed out that several leading foreign exchange tools, such as XE.com, Oanda and Bloomberg, have already adopted XBT as the code for bitcoin. However, the vast majority of the bitcoin community and most media outlets still use BTC.  B, ฿ or Ƀ?  The group will also seek to create a Unicode-approved bitcoin symbol, an issue that has long been debated by the bitcoin community.  Without a Unicode symbol, there is no option for displaying a symbol in a standard computer typeface. While seemingly small, many community members have argued that the issue could hinder long-term adoption, as both online and print media are forced to use non-standard workarounds.  The leading symbols that will be considered for bitcoin are B, ฿ and Ƀ, though the Bitcoin Foundation said it will seek to involve the community in its ultimate decision.  ""The working group will deploy a consensus-based process for reaching an agreement for the official currency symbol,"" the foundation said.  How many decimal places?  Finally, in addition to the new symbol, the working group has also been tasked with standardising bitcoin's subunits, an increasingly important issue as 1 BTC is valued in the hundreds of dollars and needs to be easily divisible to transact in smaller day-to-day quantities.  The foundation explained the issues that would be addressed by standardisation:  ""Currencies today operate with two decimal spaces to the right ($1.00). In bitcoin, there are currently eight so one could theoretically pay you 0.00000001 or one hundred-millionth of a bitcoin. Not only is this confusing for consumers, it does not fit in existing systems and software for accounting practices.""  The working group is run by volunteers and headed by NASA veteran Beth Moses, who has previously helped standardise and test extravehicular interfaces for the International Space Station.  Moses is currently designing and building equipment and facilities for Virgin Galactic – flights for which are already on sale for BTC. Or is it XBT?

42426129,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIilFh,1412690475,State of Bitcoin Q3 2014: Ecosystem Maturing Amid Price Pressure,"State of Bitcoin Q3 2014 from CoinDesk      Download the full report in PDF form. View more of CoinDesk's Research Reports here.      We are pleased to release our latest quarterly State of Bitcoin update.      This article will run through some key findings from the new report, which focuses on data and events in the third quarter of 2014 up to the present day.      Overall, this quarter could be characterized as a ‘Tale of Two Bitcoins’.      On the one hand, significant bitcoin venture investment continued and much progress was made in furthering adoption, particularly in bitcoin's use as a medium of exchange.      On the other, there was a steady erosion in the price of bitcoin throughout the quarter (Slide 10), which was further punctuated by a sharp plunge of roughly 20% at the start of Q4.    Price still a focus    Last quarter we noted how some noteworthy bitcoin observers felt that there has been too much emphasis placed on bitcoin’s price. However, out of the 10 most read stores on CoinDesk during the second quarter, four were about bitcoin’s price.      In the third quarter this interest has only increased, as almost twice as many of the top 10 CoinDesk stories were focused on bitcoin’s price (Slide 20).      Given how the fourth quarter has begun we do not expect interest in bitcoin’s price to abate any time soon.    Q2 price gains lost in Q3    In the media business it is often said that bad news sells more than good, so perhaps the fact that bitcoin’s price fell nearly 40% in Q3 helps explain the greater relative interest in price in the most recent quarter.      The third quarter also featured a remarkable price coincidence: after rising 39.4% in Q2, bitcoin’s price fell by a nearly identical amount in Q3 (Slide 9).      A wide range of theories have been put forth to explain bitcoin’s price decline, ranging from macroeconomic factors (such as a strong US dollar) and regulatory concerns (like the BitLicense), to a lack of speculative investment momentum (Slide 15).      One of the more widely debated and somewhat counterintuitive theories proposed by Citi and others on why bitcoin’s price saw a steady decline throughout Q3 is increasing merchant adoption.      This theory goes as follows: growing merchant acceptance by companies like Dell is creating selling pressure as these companies quickly liquidate bitcoins they accept for national currencies.      However, right now there are arguably too few merchant transactions to have a significant influence on price (for example Overstock is only averaging $15k per day in bitcoin sales) while a single bitcoin exchange like Bitstamp can do upwards of several millions of dollars in bitcoin trading volume each day.      Additionally, while it’s true that in the short-term timing differences may lead to commerce supply-demand imbalances, over the medium-term bitcoin-to-fiat conversions by payment processors should be balanced by fiat-to-bitcoin conversions by bitcoin-spending consumers (Slide 13).    All-time bitcoin startup VC investment crosses $300 million    While Q3 did not match the second quarter’s $73m in venture investment, the third quarter saw a substantial $60m of new venture capital invested in bitcoin startups.      To date, including early Q4 deals such as Blockchain's $30.5 million round a total of $317m has now been invested in bitcoin startups since 2012; 71% of this figure ($224m) has come in 2014 alone (Slide 27).    2014 VC investment to exceed 1995 Internet    One of the more widely discussed elements of earlier State of Bitcoin reports has been our comparison of the level of investment in early Internet startups versus investment in early bitcoin startups.      VCs such as Marc Andreessen have compared bitcoin’s overall potential, as well as its current stage of development, to the Internet circa 1993.      Our comparison was meant to assess whether VCs are backing up their lofty bitcoin statements with their wallets. And notwithstanding a number of methodological issues which we discussed previously with making this comparison (including inflation and changes over time in the cost of launching a startup), we feel the comparison is still interesting and useful.      We are currently projecting a total of $290m to be invested in bitcoin startups for the calendar year of 2014. This figure would well exceed the $250m invested in first sequence Internet startups in 1995 (Slide 32).      *Note: Only includes first sequence venture deals; late-stage 1995 Internet investments totaling $257.6m are excluded.      Sources: PricewaterhouseCoopers, National Venture Capital Association, CoinDesk, Dow Jones VentureSource, VentureScanner.      The 2014 run rate for publicly-disclosed VC investment in bitcoin startups would also equal nearly three times more than the total investment VCs made in bitcoin startups in 2013.      In short, a ‘wall of money’ continues flowing towards bitcoin startups. This massive investment made by venture capitalists is shaping up to be one of the most important bitcoin stories for 2014.    More commerce and consumer traction    Bitcoin has seen much faster adoption as an alternative store of value, or object of speculation, than as a medium of exchange.      In the third quarter Dell became the largest retailer by far to begin accepting bitcoin for payment for anything on the Dell.com site (Slide 44).      Companies like Dell and Purse.io also are giving consumers compelling reasons to actually spend bitcoins by offering savings off full retail price of anywhere between 10-30%.      While we have shaved our end of year forecast slightly we are continuing to see strong growth in the number of merchants accepting bitcoin (Slide 42).      There were 1.2 million new bitcoin wallets created in Q3, representing 21% growth quarter-over-quarter. We continue to forecast 8 million total bitcoin wallets by the end of 2014 (Slide 47).

42426126,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIil7h,1412679599,New Fund Gives Traders Blue-Chip Stock Exposure for Bitcoin,"Suppose you could trade your bitcoin for shares in, say, Apple Inc, just as the company is on the cusp of rolling out its biggest product release in years. Or perhaps use that bitcoin stash to buy stock in London-listed Vodafone to enjoy its 5.4% dividend yield.  That's what First Global Credit wants to do with a new derivatives product for bitcoin holders that will allow them to participate in global equities markets, without cashing their bitcoin in for fiat. The fund allows investors to keep their funds in bitcoin, while seeking returns with those holdings.  Gavin Smith, First Global’s chief executive, said:  ""If you believe bitcoin is going to increase in value, you don't want to lose that potential. [Our product] will retain the value of your bitcoins, and you will also hopefully make money on your investment.""  First Global formally launched yesterday at Inside Bitcoins Las Vegas, a three-day digital currency conference running through 7th October at the Flamingo Hotel and Casino.  Blue-chip stocks for bitcoin  First Global sells a type of derivative known as a 'contract for difference' (CFD). Further, it has created 109 CFDs that are based on blue-chip technology stocks, index funds for the major markets, including the S&P 500 and FTSE 100 and popular exchange-traded funds.  When a First Global customer buys a 'share' of Apple through the fund, for example, she does not own the underlying equity. Instead, she owns a CFD issued by First Global. First Global then buys the Apple share and holds it in its own account, Smith explained.  If Apple declares a dividend – it usually yields just under 2% since it resumed paying dividends regularly in 2012 – then the Apple CFD holder at First Global will receive a dividend in the form of a credit in her First Global account.  The First Global customer can withdraw dividends or sell her Apple CFD holdings at any time, according to Smith. If the investor was long Apple and the stock price went up, then she would receive the difference between the purchase price and the sale price. She would then cash out of the trade in bitcoin.  ""The investor will walk away with bitcoins,"" Smith said.  CFDs and regulation  CFDs are derivatives that can be created for almost any type of security, including treasury bonds, foreign exchange rates, commodities and indices. Unlike futures contracts, they don't come with a delivery date. Instead, CFDs based on stocks mimic the purchase of actual shares.  The benefit of a CFD is that it allows buyers to gain exposure to the underlying asset at a fraction of the cost of actually acquiring the asset. This is because CFDs can often be bought on margin, meaning the buyer need only pay a small percentage upfront.  CFDs are offered by big banks like Barclays, for example, which offers its customers contracts on thousands of equities and commodities. Many countries allow trading in CFDs, like the UK and Australia. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), however, does not allow trading in CFDs, so US residents generally don't have access to these derivatives.  Leverage trading risks  One of the reasons CFDs aren't allowed by the US regulator is because of the high levels of leverage they typically require. Even Smith acknowledged that trading CFDs with large amounts of borrowed money can be risky, although he is quick to point out that it's using too much borrowed money and not the contracts that are the potential issue:  ""The risk is really around the gearing rather than the product itself.""  First Global will offer margin trading, he said, but at ""conservative"" levels. Traders can leverage up to five times what they deposit with First Global.  The company charges commissions on each trade of 1.45% for long-only investors and 0.1% for active traders. An additional financing fee of 2.08% is also levied to make up for the difference when taking bitcoin deposits from clients, but buying securities in fiat. Active traders must also pay a holding charge of 0.1% if contracts are held overnight.  Hedge management  Smith stressed that First Global will not be taking risks with investors' money. The fund will match all buys with underlying securities on a ""one-for-one"" basis, he said. In addition, the fund has a hedging strategy to ensure that its holdings aren't affected by violent moves in either the cryptocurrency or traditional equities markets.  Hedging risk is Smith's specialty. He comes to the bitcoin markets from two decades devising hedging strategies for commodities and derivatives at Credit Suisse and Trafigura, one of the largest global commodity trading firms.  At Trafigura, he constructed strategies to hedge metals and oil. He set up the bitcoin fund with Marcie Terman, who holds the post of communications director. The two have funded the company themselves, with no outside investment.  Smith explained that First Global, which is currently domiciled in Belize, will move to the European Union in the coming months, and that customers will be expected to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) checks.  ""We can't offer the anonymity that some people would like to have. But the flipside is we are operating fully within the legal framework,"" he said.  First Global is looking to expand the range of securities offered to include fixed-income assets and commodities in the future.  Smith concluded:  ""It's a new market now, it's very small. But we believe it will grow significantly over the next three years.""  Disclaimer: This article should not be viewed as an endorsement of any of the companies mentioned.

42377668,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72ylL,1412675521,European Commissioner-Designate to Discuss Bitcoin at EU Hearing,"The European Parliament is set to quiz several nominees for European Commission posts this week, including Britain's Lord Jonathan Hill, who is scheduled to appear before parliament today. Notably, Lord Hill is expected to discuss digital currencies during his appearance.  Lord Hill, the commissioner-designate for the Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union portfolio, has already attended one hearing, which took place last week. At that hearing, Hill and another designate were posed a number of questions from lawmakers and committees, submitted by Martin Schulz, the President of the European Parliament.  Lord Hill was asked a further set of supplementary questions to elaborate his position on the matter and to outline his recommendations for digital currencies like bitcoin.  Finding a balance  In his response, which leaked to media ahead of his second hearing, Lord Hill points out that bitcoin is just one of more than 200 virtual currencies and indicates his belief that there is a need to find a balance between safety and innovation.  Cryptocurrencies can often bring ""faster and cheaper"" means of payments than traditional bank transfers, he says, but they suffer from a lack of regulation, security and capital requirements that currently apply to other payment services providers, thus creating prudential risks.  The issue falls within the responsibilities of the new Director General for Economic and Financial Affairs, Lord Hill adds, pledging that he would ensure the development of digital currency markets is kept ""under close scrutiny"" with a view to early identification of potential emerging risks.  ""If such risks are identified,"" he continues, ""I am ready to discuss quickly with this House what needs to be done in terms of better protecting users – as, in fact, was done for payment services.""  Lord Hill further outlines his first proposal for digital currency regulation:  ""One possibility would be to propose to include Virtual Currency Exchange Platforms as 'obliged entities', and thereby subject to the customer due diligence requirements in the Directive. This would send a clear signal to Member States and encourage common solutions at EU level.""  Commission role  The European Commission has played an active role in discussions of the EU's task force on virtual currencies, led by the European Banking Authority (EBA). That effort, Lord Hill says, helped identify the main risks associated with cryptocurrencies and put forth a number of recommendations, explaining:  ""This resulted in an Opinion of the EBA that recommended that EU legislators consider declaring market participants at the direct interface between conventional and VCs, such as virtual currency exchange platforms, to become ‘obliged entities' under the EU Anti Money Laundering Directive and thus subject to its anti-money laundering (AML) and counter terrorist financing (CFT) requirements.”  According to existing EU legislation and the 3rd AML directive, financial institutions are deemed obliged entities, which means they must comply with AML and CFT requirements. The directive itself offers a certain level of flexibility, since it enables a tailored risk-based approach, proportionate to the size and nature of the obliged entity.  The EBA recommended that EU legislators consider declaring digital currency exchanges as obliged entities earlier this year.  Further discussions on the subject are expected later this month, during a new round of negotiations on the commission's 4th AML directive. Lord Hill indicates that commissioner designate Věra Jourová would be in charge of the issue.

The figure is one of the largest ever single investments in a bitcoin company, after BitPay announced a new record with its $30m Series A round in May and Xapo achieved the gold standard for total funding with $40m over two rounds in March and July.  Blockchain is the world's most popular bitcoin wallet provider, search and technical information source with 2.3 million wallet accounts and a total $26bn in transaction volume.  Today's news marks its first funding round from external investors. It was previously bootstrapped by founders including Roger Ver, who remains with the company.  Blockchain president Peter Smith said:  ""The company has grown exponentially in every way over the last 18 months. We are honoured to add investors and partners to the team with deep expertise in financial services and consumer technology.""          Future Plans  According to a report in the New York Times, Lightspeed partner Jeremy Liew will take a seat on Blockchain's board.  Blockchain will use the extra funding to grow its product and engineering teams, and expand and invest in developing markets. Wallet services would be the ""central nexus of value creation"" in the digital currency industry, said Liew.  Founder and CEO Nicolas Cary told CoinDesk he was looking forward to the opportunities such an investment would bring. He said:  ""This is the first outside capital in Blockchain. We've accomplished a lot with a little. So now we're even more excited about what we can do. We have a very compelling product roadmap and we're eager to share it with our users over the coming months.""  Blockchain produces software tools for merchants to accept bitcoin, and acquired bitcoin price and data provider ZeroBlock last December. It also manages the premium domain name bitcoin.com, which it uses to introduce bitcoin to total newcomers.  Key bitcoin player  The announcement from one of bitcoin's oldest and more respected service providers is bound to warm hearts in the bitcoin world, amid news dominated recently by price drops and market anomalies.  Blockchain is notable for practicing the cryptocurrency ethos it preaches. Its mission is equal parts growth of its own business and building an international bitcoin ecosystem.  Fervently decentralized and traditionally bitcoin only, Blockchain's international staff have received salaries in bitcoin and the company has until now done its deals, including acquisitions, in bitcoin.  It is also one of the only major bitcoin companies to not have a bitcoin trading or even a buying platform, preferring to focus on making bitcoin accessible and useful to everyone.  Rapid expansion  Blockchain's growth reflects the rise of bitcoin's own popularity and awareness levels. The company, which was a one-man operation from its August 2011 beginning until the spring of 2013, and operated with only a handful of employees as recently as seven months ago, now has a total 21 employees in various locations around the world.  It recently announced its two millionth wallet account (there are now 2.3 million), more than half of which are from sign-ups made this year. At the beginning of 2013, it had just 110,000 accounts and by the end of October that year it had 500,000.  The Blockchain mobile app's relaunch on both Android and iOS, together with its re-admission to Apple's iOS App Store in July, are in part responsible for those numbers.      Other investors in this funding round included Mosaic Ventures, Prudence Holdings, Future Perfect Ventures, and a number of angels including Rafael Corrales of CRV, Amit Jhawar of Braintree and Nat Brown, among others.

42377669,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72ynr,1412656700,SolidX Raises $3 Million to Give Institutional Investors Better Access to Bitcoin,"New York City-based SolidX has raised $3m to bring financial instruments – including 'total return swaps' – to large institutional bitcoin investors.  Founded in early 2014, SolidX’s funding round came from a group of investors led by Liberty City Ventures and hedge fund manager James Pallotta.  The team at SolidX is comprised of professionals with backgrounds on Wall Street. The company sees a huge opportunity to provide the traditional finance industry a way to access bitcoin.  SolidX CEO Daniel Gallancy told CoinDesk the company wants to provide a Wall Street with bitcoin investment tools:  “Institutional investors, a large pool of capital, have largely been left out of what is a tremendous innovation.”  A way to institutionally invest  Gallancy has a proprietary trader and tech sector investment analyst background. He’s also been paying attention to bitcoin since 2011. The problem, he said, is that bitcoin is a tough sell to the people making investment decisions in the millions of dollars.  He says Wall Street analysts, “are very aware of bitcoin, a lot of them think it's great. [But] they can’t pitch it to their portfolio manager because there’s no real way for them to buy.”  Gallancy said this is why SolidX is bringing the total return swap to bitcoin:  “We offer financial entities, hedge funds and family offices a total return swap – an instrument they are very accustomed to dealing with.”  A total return swap allows buying or short selling of a security that an investor does not have direct access to.  The total return swap is a form of derivative used, for example, by many investors when buying securities in a foreign market where access is limited to only local investors. In this same way, the total return swap offered by SolidX gives an institutional investor an avenue to bitcoin.  The flexible swap  The term ‘swap’ received a negative image during the 2008 financial crisis – especially the credit default swap, which was a complex instrument used in theory to limit exposure to credit risk.  Gallancy told CoinDesk the total return swap is simpler:  “A swap, for all intents and purposes, is simply a legal contract. You are entitled the dollar return on the underlying asset.“  “The idea is to give a return on the underlying asset without having to think about anything except for its price,” he added.  The company gave careful thought to choosing the right financial instrument to provide wider investor access to bitcoin. SolidX eventually chose the total return swap as the right vehicle to get off the ground, as it is flexible enough to work with any block chain-based technology, not just bitcoin.  Other block chain-based currencies, should they become popular, could conceivably be used by this particular instrument in the future.  “We didn’t just jump right into this,” said Gallancy. “One of the reasons we chose this is because of the flexibility of swaps. “  Bitcoin in financial markets  As bitcoin becomes more well-known on Wall Street, investment funds will want to put capital into the digital currency. This is what the financial industry as a whole does – it’s always on the lookout for new financial opportunities.  Institutional-grade bitcoin exchanges such as itBit and Vaurum have been around for some time now, yet they are more trading platforms than anything else.  Gallancy also noted Bitfinex offers bitcoin swaps on its platform. However, he said SolidX is offering an internationally recognized swap as accredited by the International Swap and Derivatives Association, or ISDA.  It’s possible SolidX’s entrance into the market could mean further institutional investment into digital currencies outside of major VC funds that have put money in bitcoin startups.  David Lehmann, SolidX’s president, told CoinDesk:  “While institutions to date are invested on the venture capital side through Andreessen Horowitz and Fortress, we believe that financial institutions are going to want exposure to bitcoin as an asset class.”  Growth image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/07/solidx-raises-3-million-to-give-institutional-investors-better-access-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6482273866a25a0ae77d4487d0be9732196b72f1-1456x971.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377662,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX72yhZ,1412651012,Overstock Hires Counterparty Developers to Build Cryptosecurity Stock Exchange,"Global e-commerce giant Overstock.com has hired the developers behind peer-to-peer decentralized exchange Counterparty to develop a new stock market platform powered by cryptocurrency technology.  The developers will work on a platform called 'Medici', an evolution of Overstock's previously announced 'cryptosecurity' offering that will allow not only Overstock, but other businesses, the ability to issue cryptosecurities to the investing public.  Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne made the official announcement at the Inside Bitcoins Las Vegas conference today during his keynote speech entitled 'Cryptosecurities: the Next Digital Frontier’. The three-day conference began on 5th October and will run through 7th October at the Flamingo Hotel & Casino.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Byrne indicated that this latest move finds Overstock advancing beyond the exploratory phase with crypto 2.0 technologies.  Byrne told CoinDesk:  ""We're committed. We formed a business unit within Overstock, we have lawyers, we have developers, these guys have a multimillion-dollar budget and they have moved to Utah. We're full speed ahead.""  With the announcement, Counterparty founders Robby Dermody and Evan Wager told CoinDesk that they have now turned their focus primarily to the Medici project, though this will entail work for Counterparty as Medici will be built on top of the Counterparty protocol. Dermody and Wagner are now working to find replacement candidates to cover their duties at Counterparty while working on Medici.  The developers will first work to create the software as part of the Overstock corporate entity, but they will eventually be allocated to a new company that will seek to monetize the platform and introduce new value-added services.  Launched in January, Counterparty quickly built itself into a market leader using a DIY approach, the bitcoin protocol and Counterparty's own native currency XCP to facilitate digital asset exchange. Counterparty developer Adam Krellenstein will continue to work full-time on Counterparty following the announcement.  All-star team  In addition to the Counterparty development team, Byrne told CoinDesk that the project will also involve Perkins Coie, the Seattle-based law firm that represents some 40 startups in the bitcoin space, including major players such as bitcoin wallet provider Xapo and digital currency exchanges Kraken and Coinsetter.  Byrne indicated that Perkins Coie will help the Medici project with what will perhaps be its toughest challenge, securing approval with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US federal regulator that enforces securities law and regulates that nation's stock and options exchanges.  Byrne told CoinDesk:  ""The technology is a hurdle we can quite comfortably clear. We don't know yet how high the regulatory hurdle is, but we've jumped regulatory hurdles before and we don't have reason to think this is insurmountable.""  Overstock first announced its intention to explore a cryptosecurity offering via a company wiki page in late July.  At the time, Byrne told CoinDesk that the move was, in part, an attempt to raise the issue of cryptosecurities with the SEC.  Kindred philosophies  For the initial proposal, Overstock asked the bitcoin community to provide the company with information on asset trading platforms that might be able to host the offering, with BitShares, Counterparty, Ethereum and NXT all receiving attention among a wider field of competitors.  Byrne said that while he had considered other platforms, he ultimately felt that the Counterparty team and its underlying use of the bitcoin protocol provided the best opportunity to bring his ideas to light.  ""The block chain has been pounded on by all these hackers around the world,"" he said. ""It's the most secure.""  Byrne went on to laud Krellenstein, Dermody and Wager for their dedication to philosophy, math and computer science, as well as their decidedly non-Wall Street approach to finance.  ""They're true to the ethics of bitcoin, true to the open-source nature, they're true to the principles,"" Byrne added.  At press time, the value of XCP, Counterparty's native currency has increased more than 150% on the news.  Regulatory focus  Dermody told CoinDesk that his team saw the Medici project as too big to ignore, given the effects its success could have on businesses and the wider economy.  Likewise, Wagner said Medici will go beyond previous asset exchange projects through its effort to ensure the technology meets the approval of US regulators.  ""Medici will provide a comprehensive built-in digital asset exchange, [but] that's very different when you're going through a process of regulatory compliance,"" he said. ""This project is going to make that effort.""  Byrne said the name Medici was also chosen as a reflection of the project's ambitious goals, as it takes the name of the famous 15th century Italian bank that made notable contributions to the fields of accounting and banking.  ""It seemed like an appropriate tip of the hat,"" Byrne said.
