The SEC published  an ""order instituting proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove a proposed rule change"" filed by Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. If approved, Cboe would have the green light to list a bitcoin ETF pitched earlier this year by money management firm VanEck and crypto startup SolidX.  As part of that process, the SEC wants more input from the public – to date, according to the agency, more than 1,400 comments have been submitted.  SEC secretary Brent Fields wrote in the order:  ""Institution of such proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change. Institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, as described below, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule change.""  Under the terms of the proposal, VanEck and SolidX would create a bitcoin trust, in which SolidX would list shares. The SEC has already delayed making a decision on the matter once, and can potentially delay making a final decision through February under existing regulations.  Last month, the SEC made waves after it moved to reject nine proposed bitcoin ETF proposals – only to reverse course soon after and launch a review of those decisions.

42401921,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2uzs,1537471808,Enigma Delays Release of 'Discovery' Protocol on Ethereum Mainnet,"Enigma, the startup seeking to bring privacy to the world of public blockchains, is delaying the launch of its mainnet as part of a wider reworking of its developmental roadmap.  The company had previously planned to deploy its ""Discovery"" protocol on the live ethereum network or ""mainnet"" – it launched on an ethereum ""testnet"" over the summer – by the end of the third quarter. According to a blog post published Thursday, that plan has changed in the interest of building out the Enigma ecosystem and continuing to work with the project's stakeholders.  ""We have decided to extend our initial timelines and focus on working with our partners to grow our ecosystem, expand Enigma's capabilities, and build secret contracts,"" the team wrote. ""Importantly, we will keep a strong focus on acquiring and onboarding new launch partners between now and a mainnet launch – and you can stay tuned for more news on this front.""  When reached for comment, Tor Bair, Enigma's head of growth and marketing, reiterated that reasoning, telling CoinDesk:  ""From my perspective, the decision to delay a mainnet release means we'll be able to achieve our long-term mission faster of supporting global adoption of dApps. Given our focus, it's not a delay at all – it's actually an acceleration towards our primary mission. It means we're building a healthier, larger ecosystem sooner. It's an easy business decision and a difficult communication.""  Bair also criticized the focus on deadlines, arguing that ""dates make for speculation.""  ""Honestly, the addiction to 'when mainnet' isn't healthy for protocols. It's like demanding quarterly earnings from public companies, except we're an early stage startup and we have to ship high-stakes code instead of just revealing a balance sheet,"" Bair went on to write. ""We have no intention of shipping something without having immediate adoption, and we want to minimize risks for the projects who will depend on us.""  Enigma's roadmap is notable for its complexity, with several different ""mainnet"" launches planned over the next couple of years. Discovery would mark a milestone in deploying Enigma's ""secret contracts"" to the live ethereum network. Secret contracts, in contrast to normal smart contracts, conceal the data they're processing, potentially allowing decentralized applications to handle sensitive personal data such as financial and medical information.  Last month, Enigma revealed exclusively to CoinDesk eight launch partners that planned to deploy the Enigma's secret contracts following Discovery's launch.  Discovery represents an intermediate step towards Enigma's ultimate goals, however, with subsequent releases – ""Voyager,"" ""Valiant"" and ""Defiant,"" each with their own testnet and mainnet stages – incorporating technology such as multiparty computation, further decentralizing the Enigma protocol, enabling it to scale more effectively, and transitioning it to its own blockchain.

42401912,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2usz,1537466412,Quick Brew? Bitfury's Coffee Machine Accepts Bitcoin Via Lightning Network,"Blockchain firm Bitfury has come up with a novel product aimed at making it easier to pay for products with bitcoin.  A specialized engineering team within the company has developed a coffee vending machine capable of connecting to the Lightning Network, a second-layer transaction protocol designed to make bitcoin more scalable by processing transactions off the main bitcoin blockchain.  As a result, the vending machine can accept bitcoin payments without charging high fees or requiring long transaction times, according to a press release. LightningPeach, the team behind the new vending machine, added a device capable of joining the network to a coffee machine that already sported some built-in smart components.  The device is composed of a small Raspberry Pi computer and a unique circuit board designed by the team to process transactions.  Vasyl Grygorovych, LightningPeach's head of community, told CoinDesk that the team's strategic goal is to develop a real-world infrastructure for faster bitcoin payments.  ""With a small computer and a chip, which is assembled by us or is easy to reproduce … it is much easier to pay with cryptocurrencies than with credit cards, because you don't need your credit cards at all, you just need your mobile device,"" he said.  The team's head, Pavel Prikhodko, explained that the chip can be installed on other types of devices as well.  He continued:  ""In a way, as we connect this machine, we can connect lots of other stuff, both offline and online. It relies on the infrastructure we built, so we really want for this to open the road to other businesses who want to try crypto. We want to [build] a way to do this easily.""  Users can scan a QR code on the machine using their phones, which connects to a bitcoin wallet, the release explains. They would then be charged $2 for a cup of coffee, which the system would then convert into roughly 15,800 satoshis (smallest subdivision of a bitcoin).  Grygorovych said the team modified a commercially available coffee maker, which already had the ability to connect to the internet, making accessing the Lightning Network relatively easy.  ""We just need to put this hardware inside,"" Prikhodko said.  Moreover, Prikhodko explained, ""Cheaper [chips] can be installed into a majority of vending machines, so you can use them whenever you want ... like universities or malls. And people [who] have bitcoin wallets with Lightning support can just pay with no issues.""  While the first coffee machine LightningPeach has modified remains operational inside Bitfury's office, there are no plans to distribute a mass-production version at this time. Rather, the device was built to determine whether Lightning-compatible vending machines were feasible at all.

42401913,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2uvw,1537461936,Just a Cycle? Big Bitcoin Miners Stay Positive in Face of Market Slump,"Despite the downturn in the crypto markets so far in 2018, executives from several bitcoin mining firms have said this scenario has been seen before and they are not deterred by current low prices.  Speaking on stage at CoinDesk's Consensus Singapore 2018 event Thursday, Alex Ao, founder of Chinese firm Innosilicon – which launched in 2014 to become one of the first bitcoin ASIC makers – said he believes the mining business has its own cycles and the current bear market is actually a good time for his firm to double down on its efforts.  Ao said:  ""We started out in 2014 and saw the price of bitcoin go up and down over the years, but we still believe in the future. ... History always repeats itself and that's the nature of economy.""  Offering a similar sentiment, Henry Monzon, chief revenue officer for bitcoin miner maker Bitfury, thinks the mining industry is entering a consolidation phase as it continues to mature.  Monzon continued to say that Bitfury doesn't even plan to expand its efforts to mining cryptocurrencies on other networks, at least not in the short term. ""It's too early to decide on going to other cryptocurrencies,"" he added.  As a sign of that focus, the firm this week announced the launch of its latest bitcoin ASIC chip – one that it claims will bring new efficiencies to bitcoin mining.  The Bitfury exec also commented that the mining industry shouldn't be ""overly concerned"" that traditional chip makers such as Intel and NVIDIA have now entered the space. The design requirements for traditional chips are very different from those needed for crypto, he said, and in fact that provides the industry a special advantage.  Even if history is repeating itself in terms of price cycles, the market dynamics of cryptocurrency mining are certainly shifting, with major industry players now more mature and even eyeing initial public offerings (IPOs).  As CoinDesk has reported, another mining firm, Canaan Creative, has already filed an application to go public in Hong Kong, as has Bitmain – although its bid to go public hasn't been without controversy.  Further, Bitmain, which has a dominant position as a maker of cryptocurrency mining hardware, is facing increasing disruption from competitors, as well.  Discussing these factors, Xin Xu, CEO and co-founder of ethereum mining pool SparkPool, said a sign that the cryptocurrency market has become relatively more mature is that the mining industry is ""starting to get into the public's eye sight.""  Monzon shared a similar view, saying that, with mining playing a key role in supporting cryptocurrency networks, increasing public awareness ""points to some maturity.""  Still, the industry players on the panel were somewhat skeptical when discussing the IPO aims of some mining companies.  Speaking from an investor's perspective, Bing Lin, CEO and co-founder of C Block Capital Group, said that, after having reviewed the financial numbers of many mining firms, he believed that many of them spent their revenue on seemingly irrelevant research and development, such as on AI and the internet of things.  Lin said:  ""That's like investing in the sesame, not the steak. I don't feel that being listed necessarily gives you an advantage. Money is not necessarily the only driver.""  Adding to that point, Innosilicon's Ao commented: ""If you truly believe in blockchain, you would continue to be creative without the constrains after going for public money,"" referring to public firms' strictly mandated earnings disclosures and financial stability.  Monzon further expressed doubts that there will be an IPO from a crypto mining firm in 2018, adding: ""I don't think Bitmain's business model is even sustainable.""

42401918,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2uyt,1537457737,RBS Blockchain Team Jumps Ship to Build New Startups Using R3's Corda,"A team from Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has left to start a blockchain ""venture studio"" called Chorum.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Richard Crook, who headed up the RBS innovation team, takes with him engineers Mark Simpson, Ben Wyeth and Farzad Pezeshkpour.  Their move is the latest in a string of departures by enterprise blockchain professionals from financial institutions to startups this year. Others include Amber Baldet, who left JPMorgan Chase to start Clovyr, and Julio Faura and Ed Budd, who quit Santander and Deutsche Bank, respectively, to form Adhara.  But Chorum stands out in at least one way. Normally, when blockchain-minded bankers jump ship, it's to exercise a free rein with some variant of ethereum, often by way of joining the umbrella of ConsenSys, another venture production studio.  However, Crook and his team, which developed the Cordite token project on R3's Corda platform, will continue to work closely with that software in the new Chorum studio.  Asked why he was leaving the bank, Crook told CoinDesk:  ""RBS has been a tremendous sponsor and employer. However the blockchain space has outgrown and outpaced the incumbents including RBS. We wanted to be part of this wave of disruption to both the financial and other industries.""  Crook said he has left RBS with a robust blockchain strategy, noting that the bank has an investment in R3 and have got a number of enterprise projects on the go including some relating to Cordite enterprise tokens.  But he conceded that for now at least, ""RBS's blockchain capability has very much now left the bank."" RBS representatives did not respond to requests for comment by press time.  Crook said Chorum (the name relates to a choir, and was used in the original Corda white paper) will operate as a blockchain venture studio from which full-blown startups an be spun out (a similar model to ConsenSys).  He also said Chorum will be working closely with R3 co-founder Todd McDonald, who is focused on tokenizing assets on the Corda platform.  Token sale  David Williams, the former chief executive and co-founder of broadband satellite operator Avanti Communications, will steer Crook and his engineers as CEO of Chorum.  Williams explained that Chorum's flagship protocol is a blockchain and ecosystem for enterprises called Arqit. He claimed Arqit is quantum-resistant, meaning it would be secure from attack even from a powerful future quantum computer (a long-term existential worry in the blockchain world).  Arqit has just received a ""significant investment"" in a token pre-sale from Singapore-based crypto fund Neo Global Capital (NGC), which is part of Chinese blockchain giant Neo, Williams said.  The project uses the open source Corda code base, and a secret sauce of ""proof of performance"" consensus (""a method of fairly distributing fees to nodes""), with added quantum encryption, he said.  ""Our approach is to build blockchain systems at our own cost, either by ourselves or as consortiums, and then look at an industry or marketplace and offer that blockchain in a software-as-a-service model,"" said Williams.  Regarding the token sale, Williams said it uses the etherem ERC-20 standard and Arqit will migrate to a native coin when the mainnet, or live version of its blockchain, launches. He said the hard cap for sale proceeds is $30 million, and the early indication is raising that amount will not be a problem thanks to NGC's support.  He also framed the project with a nationalistic twist, telling CoinDesk:  ""We are going to build a British public blockchain, the infrastructure of the U.K. I don't think there's anyone else in London with their own protocol.""

At press time, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading across exchanges at an average price of $0.37 – a six-week high and 13.60 percent gain from today's opening price of $0.33, according to CoinDesk's XRP Price Index (XPI).  XRP's standout 24-hour appreciation makes it the best performer out of the world's 50 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, data from CoinMarketCap reveals.  The bullish price development for XRP follows multiple positive news events regarding distributed ledger startup Ripple, the founders of which created XRP. Most recently, US banking giant PNC became the latest to adopt Ripple's xCurrent product to handle cross-border payments, though xCurrent itself doesn't utilize XRP.  XRP is still a far cry from its all-time high, currently reflecting an 89 percent depreciation from the $3.48 price point set back in January (XPI). That said, the recent price action has surpassed multiple technical hurdles which has potentially opened the door for more growth ahead.  The broader market is also flashing green today with all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization reporting positive price developments. Notably, Cardano (ADA) and EOS (EOS) are both up more than 4 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Further, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is currently printing a value north of $203 billion, up $10 billion from its low point yesterday.

42401906,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2up3,1537452364,US Lawmakers 'Strongly Urge' IRS to Update Crypto Tax Guidance,"A group of U.S. lawmakers has called on the nation's Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to release comprehensive guidance for taxpayers earning gains on cryptocurrency investments or transactions.  In an open letter sent to acting IRS commissioner David Kautter, representatives Kevin Brady, Lynn Jenkins, David Schweikert, Darin LaHood and Brad Wenstrup write that the agency has had ""more than adequate"" time to develop clear rules on how cryptocurrency-related profits would be taxed.  Rather than release such guidance, the IRS has instead focused on enforcement actions around preliminary rules released in 2014, the letter claims, citing examples such as the agency's push to collect earnings data on customers from crypto exchange Coinbase and referencing a previous letter sent to the IRS in 2017.  ""We therefore write again today to strongly urge the IRS to issue updated guidance, providing additional clarity for taxpayers seeking to better understand and comply with their tax obligations when using virtual currencies,"" the lawmakers state.  Saying that it is ""a key component of the IRS's duties"" to provide such guidance, they add:  ""We are concerned that the IRS is seeking to enforce guidance that does not adequately advise taxpayers of their tax obligations when using virtual currencies.""  Further, they argue that failing to provide sufficient guidance ""severely hinders"" taxpayers' ability to comply with tax obligations.  The House Committee on Ways and Means, which Brady chairs, will also ask the Government Accountability Office to conduct an audit on the matter, the letter adds.  Crypto advocacy group Coin Center praised the letter in a blog post, with communications director Neeraj Agrawal noting that ""currently, a user needs to calculate capital gains on every stick of gum they buy with cryptocurrency.""  ""That doesn't make sense,"" he writes, continuing:  ""We are glad to see Congress take action – there are clearly many open questions surrounding taxation of cryptocurrencies.

42401907,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd2uo4,1537444816,One of Investors' Favorite Governance Blockchains Is Handing Over $20 Million,"Governance is one of the hottest topics in crypto right now – and Decred developers' take is that the community should decide.  And, by way of the release of a communication tool called Politeia, they will soon be giving that community $20 million in DCR tokens to manage.  Stepping back, Decred was built by a startup called Company 0, which has among its ranks developers that go back to bitcoin's early days. For instance, Decred's CEO Jake Yocom-Piatt built btcsuite, a software for interacting with bitcoin using Google's programming language, Go, with several other developers that are now part of the Decred team.  In 2015, after spending several years building the suite, Yocom-Piatt penned a blog post where he recounts realizing that bitcoin's lack of robust governance would eventually hold it back.  Calling the group of developers that maintain Bitcoin Core, the most popular implementation of bitcoin, ""just another central planning committee,"" Yocom-Piatt told CoinDesk: ""If you weren't part of Bitcoin Core, and you didn't kowtow to them and do what they said, then basically anything they disagreed with wasn't gonna happen. And that model really didn't seem like it was viable to me.""  So he and his colleagues set about building an alternative.  They funded it to launch themselves. No token sale. No venture funding.  And since then, they've attracted interest from crypto-focused investors like Placeholder VC and Blue Yard Capital. Retail investors seem to be buying in too. The hash rate has increased dramatically this year as more miners put more powerful hardware to work on the network and token holders have staked some 46 percent of the total tokens minted, which locks those tokens up for on average 28 days (but up to nearly five months).  Something else has been happening behind the scenes as well.  Every block mined generates 20.13 DCR as a block reward – about $725 – 60 percent of which goes to miners, 30 percent of which goes to staked participants and 10 percent which goes to an account called the treasury.  That treasury account, which now has $20 million in it and is growing every five minutes or so as blocks are mined, is currently under the control of Decred developers, but very soon they'll release Politeia and the funds will be in the hands of the community.  While Marco Peereboom, the chief technology officer of Company 0, wouldn't commit to a specific release date, he said, the Decred developers are checking and rechecking the code to release the first live version of it any day now.  According Peereboom:  ""We have been extremely frugal spending from the treasury, and we don't consider it our funds. It is for the stakeholders to determine what it will be used for.""  Governance in vogue  The developers though have made and spent some money, though.  They paid themselves for the development of the protocol with a so-called premine – where developers of a cryptocurrency protocol generate a batch of tokens in advance of mainnet launch.  The premine accounted for 8 percent of the total token supply of 21 million tokens (just like bitcoin) – valued at around $820,000 at the time. But only 4 percent was used to pay the developers and the other 4 percent was airdropped to people to ignite interest in the protocol.  There's definitely interest in the protocol now, in part because blockchain governance has been an important topic this year.  It's the fundamental idea that bitcoin's, and even ethereum's, conflicts over the future of the protocol could be handled better should those technologies have more sophisticated governance methods.  This drove the whole development of the Tezos protocol. And ethereum competitor, EOS, had a similar idea, although its failure to launch with a fully developed decisionmaking structure has driven much of the discussion around that project.  Sure enough, EOS itself has a very similar pool of funds that developers are supposed to be handing over to the community, although without a clear method for deciding how to do that, the funds currently sit idle.  Announced last October, Politeia gives users a way to carry out conversations and community-wide decisions, vote them through and maintain a permanent record of such decisions. It allows the community to extend governance beyond verifying blocks into more complex issues, like grantmaking from the treasury or protocol upgrades.  According to Chris Burniske of Placeholder, a venture capital firm that has been very supportive of Decred:  ""Politeia lays the foundation for other organizations – be they crypto networks or organizations in the broader universe of the world – to use Politeia as a governance mechanism.""  How it works  To explain how Politeia will work on the network, it helps to explain how the protocol operates now.  Currently, Decred uses a hybrid proof-of-work/proof-of-stake system that, according to Peereboom, ""makes miners a commodity and hands ultimate decision making power to the stakeholders.""  Proof-of-work is a consensus algorithm where a distributed group of miners all compete to verify blocks of transactions by using hardware that solves mathematical puzzles. Proof-of-stake is an algorithm that puts (or elects) a certain group in charge of validating transactions.  On Decred, proof-of-stake participants double check proof-of-work miners' blocks in an experience that is somewhat like a lottery, in that they have to stake tokens to get what Decred calls ""tickets.""  Tickets are digital, like tokens. They sit in a user's wallet and give that wallet a chance to vote on verifying blocks. The system aims to have 40,960 tickets staked at any one time.  Every block, five tickets get called at random to vote on each block. When that happens, the voting ticket holders get a small reward (as of this writing, about $44 in DCR), plus they get their stake back. It currently requires about $3,500 worth of DCR to stake for a ticket.  So block verification is like a roving committee for double-checking miners.  No one knows when one of their tickets will get chosen to vote. As such, many people keep DCR tokens staked to possibly get picked to vote and in turn, get some extra tokens.  Politeia operates on the assumption that people holding these stakes in the hopes of being chosen to verify blocks are long DCR, sophisticated about how it operates and interested in its progress.  Censorship tokens  So Politeia leans on ticket holders, too, but there's no lottery on Politeia decisions. Every ticket gets to vote on the big decisions for the platform, such as updates and community events.  Anyone can push a proposal through Politeia, but only those with tickets can vote on them.  But the Decred developers also see a need for vetting proposals – because the internet can be a nasty place.  Peereboom told CoinDesk:  ""We all know what happens on sites like Reddit and 4chan. They are cesspools of -isms that may result in legal liabilities when displayed. So we needed some much dreaded censorship capabilities.""  The architects then created what's called a censorship token. Everyone who posts a proposal will receive a token that proves a proposal was posted. Admins will review all proposals before the rest of the community can see them, and abusive posts won't go up.  Proposals get timestamped, with hashes logged on the blockchain using dcrtime, Decred software that builds on previous open source tools. Interested parties can read the proposals and discuss them online, and all the discussion gets logged as well.  But if a proposal is censored, the user can prove it with the token, and if it wasn't abusive or offensive and instead was a legitimate proposal, it gives ""the voice back to the submitter to prove that there is a bad actor in the admin ranks,"" Peereboom wrote.  Once a proposal is approved, the voting period opens and those called to vote on a block will be able to make decisions about whether the proposals should get funded.  The most obvious and immediate use for Politeia will be to spend the funds in that ever-growing treasury.  As Yocom-Piatt said: ""So if you have a great idea it can get funded, and – the way that this is sort of a website on steroids – is it takes all of the data on this proposal system, including the votes, and it anchors it into the Decred blockchain. ""  A broader experiment  A preview  of the user interface is up already.  While later on, viewers will probably need to prove that they hold DCR to go in and post, Yocom-Piatt said, for now anyone can have a look.  Unlike authenticating blocks, voting on Politeia proposals doesn't come with direct rewards to participants (just like voting in a nation-state election). But if it works well, it may reward everyone as the esteem and value of the whole network increases, which would likely push up the tokens price as well.  ""Part of the Decred project certainly is a social experiment to see how far can we take decentralized sovereignty,"" Peereboom wrote, adding:  ""There are going to be good, bad and awful proposals and we will have to learn how to differentiate between them.""  Once the Decred team gets everything tweaked to work, the plan is to share the system with the world.  Although it's not the focus right now, Decred's developers believe that Politeia can manage decision making for more than just one blockchain. In an October 2017 blog post, Yocom-Piatt wrote, ""The larger goal with Politeia is to create a resilient public record that mimics the function of typical nation state websites for their governance bodies, e.g. senate.gov or house.gov.""  But for now, once the governance system launched, users will have a way to agree on how to fix any vulnerabilities or change the protocol to align with the community's vision for it.  Speaking to this, Peereboom said, ""There is no way that all assumptions we have made will prove correct and we don't claim – and we are in fact sure – that we got some things wrong. By having a change mechanism and process we can correct those assumptions.""  And Burniske, for one, is very much looking forward to the experiment.  ""Politeia is the single biggest feature upgrade that Decred has had thus far in its life,"" he told CoinDesk. ""It's really the materialization of what the Decred core team set out to build in the first place.""  Additional reporting by David Floyd.

42429694,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0hNh,1537441238,Bitcoin Price Sees High-Volume Recovery From Five-Week Lows,"Bitcoin's (BTC) has made a high volume recovery from five-week lows, although a bullish reversal is still not confirmed, technical studies indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,100 on Bitfinex at 18:00 UTC yesterday – the lowest level since Aug. 14 – signaling a downside break of the trendline connecting the June low and Aug. 11 low (lower edge of the pennant).  However, the cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid just an hour later and jumped to a high of $6,550. More importantly, trading volumes on Bitfinex increased by 66 percent during the price recovery.  While the persistent failure to beat the key support could be taken as a sign of bearish exhaustion, the upside is seen gathering pace only above $6,600 (Sept. 14 high).  At press time, BTC is trading at $6,400, representing a 1.10 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  1-hour chart  As can be seen, the big move higher witnessed during the 60 minutes leading up to 19:00 UTC yesterday was backed by a jump in trading volumes. However, so far, the follow-through has been anything but encouraging.  Nevertheless, the strong rebound from $6,100 has established the figure as a key near-term support.  Daily chart  Bitcoin remains stuck in no-man's land on the daily chart defined by the lower end of the pennant pattern and the Sept. 14 high of $6,600.  As of writing, the pennant support is located at $6,225. A UTC close below that level would signal a revival of the sell-off from May highs near $10,000.  On the other hand, a move above $6,600 would imply a double bottom bullish reversal. This scenario is looking increasingly likely, courtesy of repeated rebounds at the lower end of the pennant pattern.  View  BTC's high volume reversal from $6,100 has raised the odds of a break above $6,600 (double bottom neckline).  A double bottom breakout, if confirmed, would open the doors to $7,100 (target as per the measured move method).  On the downside, a UTC close below $6,225 (trendline support) may yield a drop to $5,859 (August low) and $5,755 (June low).

42429676,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0gnh,1537437639,Japan Lost $540 Million to Crypto Hacks in First Half of 2018,"After news broke yesterday of yet another hack of a cryptocurrency exchange in Japan, the country's police authority has released figures revealing the rise in such attacks this year.  According to a report from The Asahi Shimbun Thursday, the National Police Agency (NPA) has released data for the first six months of 2018 that reveal cyberattacks on crypto wallets and platforms tripled over the same period last year.  The NPA said that, through 158 cyber-breaches, hackers had stolen a massive 60.503 billion yen (around $540 million) worth of cryptocurrency. That figure puts the total for January through June 2017 in the shade – a period when $5.9 million in cryptos was stolen in 149 cases of theft.  As per the data, the majority of the losses for 2018's first half were stolen from exchange platforms, around $518 million. The remainder – just over $22 million – was taken from individuals' crypto wallets.  In what should be a lesson for us all in what not to do with your crypto accounts, the report said that, in over 60 percent of individual wallet breaches, the owners had used the same ID and password to protect their cryptocurrencies as they used for their e-mail and other Internet services.  The majority of the total for hacks at exchanges arose from the Coincheck exchange breach in January – possibly the worst hack ever – one that saw nearly $517 million stolen, according to the report's figures.  In the months since, the country's Financial Services Agency has moved to tighten security at exchanges via site inspections, improvement orders and even service suspensions and license denials. The NPA too has worked to persuade investors to improve their password security.  As a result, the report indicates that, while January to March saw around 76 percent of the total losses (120 cases), the number of thefts dropped off afterwards, with only 38 cases being reported.  In more detail provided by the NPA, NEM was the cryptocurrency most targeted by hackers, with $517 million taken in 36 breaches – with the vast majority having been stolen in the Coincheck hack.  Further, XRP to the value of $13.5 million was taken in 42 instances, and bitcoin worth $7.66 million was also stolen in 94 attacks.

In a blog post published Thursday, Coinbase's chief policy officer, Mike Lempres, wrote that the OAG's assertions in the report have led to misrepresentation of the exchange's business in the media.  The OAG wrote in its original report: ""Coinbase disclosed that almost 20 percent of executed volume on its platform was attributable to its own trading.""  In response, Lempres clarified that Coinbase does not ""trade for the benefit of the company on a proprietary basis.""  He continued:  ""When Coinbase executes these trades, it does so on behalf of Coinbase Consumer customers, not itself.""  Lempres further explained that the 20 percent figure represents consumer-driven volume on Coinbase Consumer, a service that executes users' orders with its own exchange, as oppose to what was described as ""self-trading"" in the report.  Jesse Powell, the founder of the U.S.-based Kraken exchange, which was named by the OAG as possibly in violation of state law, vented his anger on Twitter, describing the environment in New York generally as ""abusive.""  ""NY is that abusive, controlling ex you broke up with 3 years ago but they keep stalking you, throwing shade on your new relationships, unable to accept that you have happily moved on and are better off without them. #getoverit,"" he wrote.  Echoing that, Shapeshift's Erik Voorhees further tweeted:  ""And those kinds of people never seem to realize their behavior is what led to the breakup... NY is going to lose its position at the head of global finance if it doesn't change soon. Keep up the good work.""      Both Powell and Voorhees have been vocal in criticizing the high regulatory bars imposed by New York as stifling crypto growth in the global financial center.  Voorhees said in May at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 event in New York:      ""Here we are two miles from the Statue of Liberty and you cannot sell CryptoKitties in the state without that license.

42429683,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0gzh,1537425028,Leading Bitcoin Cash Developer Says Future Fork Unlikely,"Cryptocurrency forks are likely to slow down considerably in the future, leaders of several major projects, all of which were formed by forks, said at CoinDesk's Consensus Singapore event today.  On a morning panel, Amaury Sechet, the lead developer behind Bitcoin ABC, the most widely used bitcoin cash software implementation, noted that the industry has already seen a slowdown in forks since 2017. Over 50 percent of nodes running the bitcoin cash software, created in 2017 from a fork of bitcoin, now run Bitcoin ABC to connect to the network.  Sechet argued that each time when a cryptocurrency fork happens, it leads to the loss of the network effect in the original blockchain, reducing the ability to create future value.  ""You can only do that a certain amount of times,"" he said, adding that a majority of future crypto forks will eventually become meaningless.  In this way, he put forth the argument that the value of the fork is derived from the strength of the disagreement that sparks the fork, leading a project down competing paths.  ""I think there may be many, many forks in the future, but 99 percent of them will become worthless eventually,"" he noted. ""The bitcoin communities had many arguments before about forks, but not many people really give anything because every one just kept fighting with each other.""  Further, he said he believes it's unlikely bitcoin cash will fork in the near future, arguing that participants in the project's open-source community remain aligned on overall objectives, if recently they have diverged on specifics.  ""I think it's unlikely bitcoin cash will fork into something else,"" he said.  Jack Liao, CEO of the Hong Kong-based LighteningASIC mining equipment firm, who initiated the Bitcoin Gold fork last year, shared similar views and said communities' internal conflicts appear to have been quiet compared to last year.  ""If there's no conflict, there's no fork, because you need to get supporters,"" Liao said.  CoinDesk reported last year that Liao initiated the idea of creating Bitcoin Gold, a crypto asset that was forked off the bitcoin network in an effort to replace bitcoin mining via ASIC miners with GPU chips.  It came just months after the bitcoin cash fork, championed by mining pools and bitcoin mining giant Bitmain as a way to boost the block size of the bitcoin blockchain network for handling more transactions.  James Wo, who heads the ETC Labs, which focuses on building ecosystem for ethereum classic, also weighed in saying that the fundamental value of cryptocurrency forks comes from the string of disagreements from the community, adding:  ""The fork only happens when there's really a huge diverge in a community.""  Ethereum Classic is the cryptocurrency the continues to run the original ethereum code, after the projects main developers forked the code in 2016.  Asked about how they see the competition between crypto forks and the original network, the panelists indicated the competition certainly exists to some degree, though they compete for different businesses and user segments.  Wo, for instance, said there's competition between ethereum classic and ethereum ""for sure,"" but that they co-exist to suit different user demands, such as ETC for those who look for cheaper transaction fees while ETH for those who demand more diverse services.  Commenting on such competition, Liao said much of the attacks among the bitcoin communities also derive from their marketing and public relation strategies, referring to bitcoin cash's self-branding as the true bitcoin.  Sechet said that it's true to some extent that forks compete with each other but reinstated that the goal of what bitcoin and bitcoin cash are trying to reach do vary.

42429698,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0hPh,1537417866,Messaging Giant LINE Unveils Ambitious Plan for Crypto Token Ecosystem,"LINE, the messaging app giant from Japan, has unveiled plans that will see it launch an ambitious, token-powered ecosystem by the end of 2018.  Aimed at capitalizing on the company's big user base – LINE claims to have more than 164 million monthly active users across four key countries – the plan is centered around its previously announced LINK token. Supported by a $10 million venture fund and a newly-launched cryptocurrency exchange, LINE has already said that its initiative will focus heavily on the development of decentralized apps, or dApps, that are tied to the LINK blockchain.  The plan, as a whole, represents one of the more notable enterprise-level efforts of 2018 to apply blockchain to mainstream use cases. LINE is hoping that its LINK token will serve as the fuel for a wide range of consumer-facing applications, from payments for restaurants and other services to the serving of online content.  In a presentation given during CoinDesk's Consensus: Singapore event on September 20, LINE said that its goal is to make token and accompanying applications as easy to use as possible in a bid to migrate some of those millions of users to its nascent crypto-economy.  The idea is that, rather than distributing LINK tokens through some kind of sale, users will be rewarded through the use of dApps. Developers, in turn, can use the company's blockchain-as-a-service to develop applications of their own.  LINE's scaling solution  Perhaps more ambitious is LINE's plan for supporting the scalability of its platform.  Dubbed the LINEAR NETWORK, the plan would see dApps existing on their own so-called ""leafchains"" that exist on their own but are capable of interacting with other offshoots. LINEAR will be underpinned by the LINK token, which can be exchanged from chain to chain by way of smart contracts.  LINE expects to go live with its framework for the LINK token as well as the LINEAR NETWORK in December, according to the company's presentation.  And as reported previously, LINE is already moving to shore up its developer resources ahead of that kick-off – signaling that it will seek to have a number of dApps in place prior to launch.  EDIT (12:16 UTC, Sept. 20, 2018 ): This article has been updated to correct the claimed number of LINE users from 160 million to over 164 million.

The licensed exchange, called Zaif, is operated by the Tech Bureau. It said on Thursday that the exchange first noticed an unusual outflow of funds on the platform around 17:00 Japan time on September 14, after which the company suspended asset deposit and withdrawal services.  Tech Bureau explained that after further investigation, it discovered that hackers with unauthorized access to the exchange's hot wallets had stolen roughly $60 million in bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and MonaCoin. That being said, the exact amount of bitcoin cash stolen remains unknown.  The exchange added that since its own asset reserve is currently around 2.2 billion yen (or $20 million), it has reached an agreement with a Japan-listed firm called Fisco to receive a $44.5 million investment in exchange for a major share of ownership.  Tech Bureau said given the nature of the unauthorized fund access, it has filed the incident as a criminal case to local authorities for further investigation.  The incident marks the second hack in Japan this year, after Coincheck also reported that a whopping $520 million in NEM tokens were stolen by hackers in January.  Following Coincheck's hack, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) – Japan's financial watchdog – has launched a series of inspections on cryptocurrency exchanges in the country regarding their security measures.

42429692,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM0hHh,1537403404,Ecash's Creator Is Back – And He Thinks He's Built the Fastest Blockchain Ever,"One of the founders of the cypherpunk movement has just revealed new technology that he believes will revolutionize cryptocurrency from this moment on.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the grey-haired, digital money pioneer David Chaum is launching a new cryptocurrency Elixxir via his startup.  And his goals are bold. By using cryptographic techniques he invented decades ago, he believes he's ""reinvented"" cryptocurrency, fixing fundamental problems plaguing the emerging technology, including speed, privacy, scalability and – one that perhaps doesn't get quite as much attention – resistance to future disasters.  Even further, he thinks solving these problems will take blockchain ""mainstream.""  One of the most influential digital money pioneers leading up to bitcoin, the famed cryptographer has been sleuthing around cryptocurrency conferences recently – dropping hints here and there – sparking theories about what exactly he's been up to.  What he found, though, were many problems with the tech.  Not least of all that it takes upwards of an hour to send a secure payment, which is not at all competitive with PayPal, Visa or other major digital payment systems.  ""Yeah, it's not really suitable for widespread use,"" Chaum told CoinDesk.  But using his more than 30 years of experience working with cryptography and payments, including developing anonymous digital money eCash before even the internet existed, he thinks he's found a new way to solve these problems.  ""I think we can shoot these problems dead,"" Chaum told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It's no bullshit. We have code running in our lab.""  Claimed breakthroughs  The cryptographer claims to have made two blockchain breakthroughs.  One is to change digital signatures, a crucial cryptographic component of cryptocurrency, used to verify whether someone owns the cryptocurrency they say they do.  According to Chaum, the way digital signatures are computed in most cryptocurrencies today is just a hassle. These signatures are just too computationally expensive as is, Chaum contends.  ""There's no way we can get speed and scalability if for every transaction a server has to do a public key operation like making a signature or checking a signature,"" he said.  So, Elixxir changes it up a bit.  ""We can cheat a little bit,"" Chaum said.  Arguing that the system could carry out these public key operations ""in advance,"" Chaum explained that by doing this, Elixxir is no less than a thousand times faster than any other blockchain.  ""It's a breakthrough. No one else does anything like it,"" he added.  The public key cryptography used in Elixxir has another impact as well – it futureproofs the cryptocurrency for the era of quantum computers. Currently, most cryptocurrencies architecture leaves them vulnerable to quantum computers.  And while this technology is likely still a long way from release, Chaum thinks this is such an important notion that he argues governments should be spending time on making sure digital money is quantum resistant.  One honest person  Then there's the privacy of Elixxir – arguably Chaum's forte, as he's known as the ""father of online anonymity.""  Within the Elixxir architecture, Chaum believes ""true privacy"" can be achieved through so-called ""multi-party computations"" – a term he coined decades ago and a feature that's used for enhanced privacy in cryptocurrency projects like Zcash and Enigma.  The gist of the system is that a bunch of developers or nodes are involved in a cryptocurrency computation, but only one person needs to be honest in order for the computation to work and for the data to stay private.  Elixxir uses this idea in a novel way. The nodes on the network, called ""Mixnodes,"" produce a multi-party computation for every block of transactions.  Chaum compares this process to a group of people sitting around a card table. Each cuts the deck and shuffles, passing it to the next person. Say three of them are card sharks who know how to shuffle in a way that helps them to determine the location of the cards in the deck.  But if just one of these people is honest and shuffles sufficiently, the card sharks, in the end, are ""completely in the dark,"" Chaum said.  He continued:  ""Despite their best efforts to collude, and you know make notes of exactly what they do and everything, they are powerless against the one party that actually does what they're supposed to.""  And in this way, Elixxir privatizes transactions.  Skepticism, everywhere  What brought Chaum to build Elixxir was suspicion and apprehension about the state of the cryptocurrency industry today.  ""In this space, there are a lot of unfounded claims being made,"" he told CoinDesk.  ""People bend the rules. They try to present things in a way that makes them look as good as possible,"" Chaum continued, arguing many projects ""gloss over"" various technical issues that could break or undermine a project.  Yet, there's a similar skepticism on the part of crypto enthusiasts investigating Chaum's promises. A notable example is when the pseudonymous cryptocurrency blogger WhalePanda dug up the Elixxir website prior to today's announcement, expressing concerns about what he found.  While Elixxir claims to boost privacy, WhalePanda argued that requiring participants to send their name and location in a ""KYC form"" runs counter to those goals.  But with the technical brief now released, the broader community will be able to determine whether the breakthroughs are actually that, or whether there are bumps in the system.  All in all, though, while the project is currently focused on payments, Chaum believes Elixxir could play an even bigger part in ensuring more people have control over their data online.  ""The bigger aim is to create the expectation of the broader public for fundamental human rights – digital rights in their ability to control all these aspects of their digital lives,"" he told CoinDesk, concluding:  ""Cryptography is the only thing that can give power to the individual in the Information Age.""
