42395175,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXSEm,1658274263,Another Twitter Hack Hits the NFT Community,"Another phishing scam has hit the non-fungible token (NFT) community, with the latest target being the social media accounts of NFT influencer Zeneca.  The compromised Twitter and Discord accounts linked to a fake airdrop for the influencer’s “Zen Academy Founders Pass,” tricking unsuspecting users into connecting their wallets. The damage from the attack remains unknown.  The hack is believed to be a part of a widespread threat against the NFT community, first alluded to on Monday in a tweet by the Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs.  Users began flagging Zeneca’s account as compromised within minutes of the tweet being sent. Justin Tayler, Twitter’s head of consumer product marketing, locked down the account 40 minutes after the hack took place. Twitter did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment on the scope of the attack.  The hack is far from the first of its kind targeting the NFT community, with Discord scams and impersonations becoming increasingly common.

Bitcoin blasted through the $23,000 threshold early in the day, rising over $23,700 at one point. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading near $23,600, a more than 6% gain during the previous 24 hours and up approximately 20% from a week ago.  Yet, bitcoin's performance pales next to ether, the token of the Ethereum blockchain, which has skyrocketed about 50% over the past seven days as updates trickle in about the Merge. The Merge will shift the protocol from its current, energy-sapping proof-of-work model to a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake one. The second-largest crypto by market cap after bitcoin was cruising comfortably above $1,500, a more than 1.5% increase over the previous day. Other major altcoins spent their Tuesday well in the green with YGG spiking over 26% at one point and ETC, the token of Ethereum Classic, climbing more than 15%.  ""Crypto may be finding a bottom,"" Noah Hammond, the CEO of asset manager AdvisorShares, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""It feels like we're in this pricing trough, bouncing off the bottom and then hitting up to the top. And over the last month, ether has been moving up significantly.""  ""Positive momentum, which is nice to see,"" Hammond added.  Cryptos' dramatic rise dovetailed with equity markets' steep gains on Tuesday as markets continued to look favorably on a number of recent earnings, particularly in the financial services sector. Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC), among others, have reported better-than-expected quarters in recent days. Investors have even found encouragement in the U.S. central bank's likely decision to boost interest rates 75 basis points instead of a more robust 100 points.  Ethereum community conference  Ether's ongoing upturn also comes as the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) kicked off Tuesday morning in Paris with more than 250 speakers and a speech from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin on Thursday. As CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole reported, ether topped a key technical level for the first time in three months, moving above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $1,327 on Monday, hitting a one-month high above $1,500. Bitcoin has remained below its 50-day SMA at $23,000.  Ether's options market turned upward on Monday, showing a bias for strength in Ethereum's native token for the first time in over six months. Meanwhile, for once the crypto day's headlines were largely absent the latest revelations about embattled crypto lender Celsius Network and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, both of which have filed for bankruptcy.  In a note to CoinDesk, Karl Jacob, the founder and CEO of stablecoin platform Bacon Protocol, believes investors ""priced in"" inflationary bad news, enabling the current crypto rally.  Jacob also noted the strength of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. ""While we have seen multiple businesses collapse in this cycle, which is never good, we have also seen the power of DeFi’s market resilience as those loans were paid back almost immediately while more traditional loans are stuck waiting for the courts to figure out who gets what,"" he wrote. ""Despite billion-dollar businesses failing, blockchain and decentralization continues to command huge interest in the eyes of investors.”  Insights  Dissecting Three Arrows Capital's Fall  In the past week, the transparency of the blockchain has met the openness of the court system in the U.S. and Singapore.  Thanks to a major disclosure to the courts on behalf of Three Arrows’ liquidator, we’ve learned a lot.  There have been revelations such as how much money Three Arrows owes Digital Currency Group’s subsidiary Genesis Global Trading. Digital Currency Group also owns CoinDesk.  Another: Despite TPS Capital’s claims to the contrary, court documents reveal a tight relationship with Three Arrows Capital.  Or, how thanks to Singapore’s transparent corporate registry ⁠– a far cry from the British Virgin Islands’ comparative black hole – we could learn about Three Arrows' stake in Deribit via a Special Purpose Vehicle.  This is all possible thanks to an open and transparent system of government in Singapore and the U.S. While Singapore is a tax haven, it’s a transparent one. Its founder, Lee Kuan Yew, saw the nation's path to prosperity as one of good governance and honesty.  There, the corporate registry is available online and for a small fee. Those wishing to find details about a company can get a list of its directors and shareholders, as well as its last filed returns.  In contrast, all of this is a black hole in the BVI. Why? Because Singapore isn’t a place to hide money, it’s somewhere to do business efficiently. BVI’s entire business model is “confidentiality,” which lends itself to the allied industry of money laundering. Under the 2004 edition of the Companies Act, directors of a firm aren’t required to be public, which is in total contrast to Singapore.  No hurry to change  And the BVI doesn’t seem to be in a hurry to change this. Although cooperation with foreign law enforcement investigations has increased post-""Panama Papers,"" a true transparent BVI wouldn’t be good for business.  As the Financial Times reports, BVI corporate registry officials will happily boast that their know-your-customer process is more careful than that of the United Kingdom’s.  “When you look at our compliance rating, it’s on a par with and in some instances actually surpasses those of the United Kingdom or the United States,” Elise Donovan, chief executive of BVI Finance, a trade body, told the FT.  But the DNA of the island is robust. The confidentiality law that helped hide TPS Capital’s connections to Three Arrows is going nowhere fast.  Lawyers in BVI who spoke to the FT scoffed at the idea behind the ""Panama Papers,"" which helped kick off reform on the island.  “Industrial-scale hacking and data theft,” said one lawyer to the FT. “What is good about that?”  So it looks like the “transparency’” of the blockchain has no home in BVI.

124990,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496138,1658271621,Bitcoin Dominance Dives As Ethereum Takes Up More Space,"The recent market recovery has seen digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum put on significant amounts of value over the last couple of days. However, there have been some who have been market leaders in this regard, and Ethereum is one of them. The digital asset had rallied upwards due to the announcement that the Merge was happening in September, but that is not the only aspect where the second-largest cryptocurrency in the crypto market had recorded a recovery. Ethereum Steals Market Dominance Ethereum’s rally above $1,500 had seen its market cap grow above $190 billion once more. The digital asset had posted some of the largest gains over the last couple of weeks, with a more than 40% recovery. This has seen the asset’s dominance across the industry grow. Related Reading | Liquidations Cross $230 Million As Ethereum Barrels Past $1,400 Although Ethereum still remains the cryptocurrency with the second-largest market dominance, it has added more over the last two days. This has seen it creep into bitcoin’s market cap as the pioneer cryptocurrency struggles to keep up with the market gains. Over the last couple of days, bitcoin has watched its market dominance declined by more than 2%. This market share was quickly soaked up by Ethereum, which has seen its dominance rise in this time period. It added more than 2% to go from straggling around $16% to its current dominance of 18.9%. ETH dominance adds 2% | Source: Market Cap ETH Dominance on TradingView.com It is expected to steal more market share from bitcoin as its price continues to grow. However, it is still a long way off from its all-time high, which had seen its dominance rise as high as 32% back in the bull market of 2017. ETH Sets Sight On $1,700 Ethereum has now broken above an important technical point. After trending below the 50-day moving average for the better part of last month, ETH has flipped this technical level and is now sitting comfortably above it. The implication of this has been a complete 180-degree turn from bearish to bullish, especially during the short term. Related Reading | The Worst May Be Over As Crypto Market Adds More Than $100 Billion After defying the bears and recovering above $1,500 this week, it is now headed towards the next important technical level. Even as the recovery trend continues, the bears have begun to mount resistance at the $1,700 level. A break above this point is important for Ethereum in the short term. If Ethereum is able to successfully beat the resistance at $1,700, the next important level becomes $1,936. This point ensures that there is not much resistance up until $2,500. However, a failure to beat the bears at $1,700 could send the digital asset spiraling down to $1,300.

123621,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4524310-usd-coin-stablecoin-interest-update-cefi-implosion?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1658268854,USD Coin Stablecoin Interest Update: CeFi Implosion,"Recent implosions of Terra Luna and Three Arrows Capital have set off a massive contagion effect in the crypto industry. Many CeFi lenders are in distress due to market downturns, risky investments, and unsecured loans. Here's a status and health summary for Centralized Finance exchanges offering interest for crypto deposits. In my article USCoin: How To Earn 6-12% Interest Safely With Stablecoins , I recommended considering high interest stablecoins to avoid the melting ice cube problem -- optimizing portfolios to fight inflation, even for cash reserves. My thesis was to hold high interest stablecoins on reputable exchanges to offset dollar value destruction. And for me, the best stablecoin for crypto yield is still USD Coin ( USDC-USD ). USDC is fully backed by cash and short-dated U.S. government obligations, and always redeemable 1:1 in US dollars. But since that article the entire crypto industry has experienced turmoil around specific coins and institutions leading to cascading liquidations, huge waves of selling, and the destruction of almost a trillion dollars from the global cryptocurrency market cap . The companies offering crypto interest were deeply affected and several have entered bankruptcy due to reckless and risky investments. This update will trace the events that brought us to this point and revisit the financial health of the platforms reviewed in my first article. The Precipitating Event: The Terra Disaster In May of this year the algorithmic stablecoin Terra ( UST-USD ) broke its dollar peg; value rapidly shrank to zero for UST and its companion token ( LUNC-USD ). Between the two coins, about $60 billion of value disappeared in a breathtaking fashion. In my stablecoin article, I warned my readers to stay away from UST. No algorithmic stablecoin has succeeded long term and the attempts are far too risky for the prudent investor. But incredibly, some of the biggest names in the crypto lending and investment funds had significant exposure to UST or LUNA and suffered because of it. As shocking as the Terra blowup was, analysts were rightly concerned about collateral damage, called contagion , appearing elsewhere. The Next Domino: Three Arrows Capital Three Arrows Capital Ltd. is a hedge fund established in 2012 and was focused on providing superior risk-adjusted returns, founded by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies. 3AC lost over $200 million in LUNA when the Terra ecosystem imploded in mid-May. ""The Terra-Luna situation caught us very much off guard,"" Davies told the WSJ. 3AC was also one of the largest holders of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">GBTC ) and staked Ethereum (stETH) tokens. When both of these assets experienced steep declines, their loans began being liquidated by lenders. A New York bankruptcy court has frozen all remaining assets of 3AC. According to lawyers representing the creditors the whereabouts of Zu and Davies are unknown. The CeFi Bank Run Panic Because of the Terra Luna disaster and the 3AC blow-up, doubts began mounting that the Centralized Finance (CeFi) banks were solvent. These are crypto lenders that take in customer assets, lend them back out to hedge funds and other institutions, and pay a portion of the interest they receive back to individual clients. The biggest potential issues with CeFi platforms were always cyber security (avoiding loss through hacks) and risk management (losing funds to poor investment choices). The problem for investors was a lack of transparency around what these firms were doing to generate yield. People began to openly question these platform's risk management strategies, if they were affected by the Three Arrows Capital debacle, and whether they had sufficient liquidity to cover a bank run type event where customers attempted to withdraw all their assets. CeFi Health Check Here's the current status of the platforms I listed in my previous article. Abra Status: Normal operations Abra has touted their sound risk management practices and so far they appear to be unaffected by the bank run plaguing other platforms. I personally have recently withdrawn a substantial amount of coins from Abra because my assets got locked on two other platforms and I couldn't take any more risk during this turbulent time. The withdrawals were processed without an issue. In a Twitter message exchange with Abra CEO Bill Barhyde , I expressed the need for CeFi platforms to release a proof of reserves attestation to give depositors assurance that funds are present. He agreed and said Abra has started that process, and that they are fully committed to releasing it when their auditor is ready. BlockFi Status: Normal operations BlockFi was pummeled by a ""bank run"" panic after Celsius paused withdrawals, but never wavered in their operations. This was partially because they had better risk management procedures but perhaps more importantly received a $250 million credit facility from FTX. Celsius Network Status: Withdrawals closed, filed for bankruptcy Celsius paused all withdrawals , swaps, and transfers between accounts on June 12 and hired external Legal and Finance teams to advise on how to restructure the company. Over the next several weeks, analysts watched a series of moves in crypto wallets associated with Celsius as the beleaguered company began repaying DeFi loans to free up capital once used as collateral. Although some loyal Celsius users held out hope the company could unwind enough assets to resume normal operations, the other shoe dropped on July 14 when the company filed petitions for Chapter 11 reorganization. The bankruptcy document signed off by CEO Alex Mashinsky shows the company holds around $4.3 billion in assets against $5.5 billion in liabilities , a $1.2 billion deficit. With the huge hole in the balance sheet and no white knight appearing to rescue Celsius, prospects for depositors appear grim. Crypto.com Status: Normal operations As far as I can tell, Crypto.com has not been affected by recent events. Hodlnaut Status: Normal operations As far as I can tell, Hodlnaut has not been affected by recent events. Vauld Status: Withdrawals closed, signed a 60 day letter with Nexo On July 4, Vauld suspended all withdrawals, trading, and deposits and as with Celsius, hired Legal and Finance advisors to look at restructuring the company. Vauld has disclosed assets worth ~$330 million and liabilities worth ~$400 million at this time. Vauld has signed a term sheet with Nexo for a 60-day exclusive period. This allows an : exploratory period related to its intended acquisition of Vauld, pending a satisfactory outcome of the initiated due diligence process. Upon successful completion of the transaction, Nexo plans to acquire up to 100% of Vauld and reorganize its future operations with the aim to accelerate its deeper presence in Asia. Voyager (VYGVQ) Status: Withdrawals closed, filed for bankruptcy Voyager ""temporarily suspended"" trading, deposits, withdrawals, and rewards on July 1, 2022 and has voluntarily entered in Chapter 11 bankruptcy to reorganize their financial obligations and hopefully resume normal operations sometime in the future. Voyager unexplainably made a $670M unsecured loan to 3AC which is now in default. This extremely risky transaction was either based on 3AC's previous stellar industry reputation or faulty financial information. From Bloomberg : On June 30, the Monetary Authority of Singapore reprimanded 3AC, without a fine or other sanction, for providing false information and exceeding the limit on its assets under management. Skin In The Game Had I known that any CeFi lenders had exposure to Terra, were making unsecured loans, or engaging in any other risky investments, I would have eliminated them from any consideration for high interest yield. Unfortunately, we don't know who is swimming naked until the tide goes out. This is a tough lesson learned both for me and other content creators. Bitboy creator Ben Armstrong (1.45M YouTube subscribers) promoted Celsius Network with referral links, and now has multiple millions stranded there. Scott Melker, also known as ""The Wolf of All Streets"" stated he is listed among the top 50 depositors on Voyager, a sum he described as ""millions ."" I had a few assets on Celsius and Vauld which totalled a very small percentage of my overall holdings. But Simon Dixon , a Celsius depositor, shareholder, and head of Bank to the Future, has related stories of people who staked their life savings on Celsius and are now desperate for help. The Celsius situation is especially tangled and may have additional twists and turns before the whole story is revealed. I still believe yield generated from institutional lending is possible with crypto just as it is for traditional finance institutions such as JP Morgan (JPM). However, CeFi banks must provide a higher level of transparency to give depositors confidence again. Congress will certainly jump on these events as an opportunity to regulate the industry -- which may be a good thing.

122590,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496188,1658267023,Bitcoin Barrels Towards $24k As Miners Move $300 Million From Wallets,"Given that the price of Bitcoin has been lingering above the $17K–$20K range over the past few weeks, Bitcoin’s sharp downturn has come to an end. The price is currently retesting the $23K resistance level after being rejected three times from the $20K support area. Bitcoin Advocates Rejoice The market flashed its first significant relief rally in at least a month, and crypto enthusiasts rejoiced at the sight of green on July 19 as the months of “down only” price action finally came to a stop. According to TradingView data, Bitcoin’s (BTC) breakthrough over resistance at $23,000 to reach a daily high of $23,447—its first appreciable move above the 200-week moving average—is largely responsible for the renewed optimism. The $23K level is also experiencing extra opposition from the 50-day moving average. A further retest of the $20K support level and perhaps a deeper negative continuation are anticipated in this situation because it appears as though these two points are currently rejecting the price’s move downward. The bulls, though, seem keen to seize the level. BTC/USD barrels towards $24k. Source: TradingView In order to assess the likelihood of a negative reversal, the price action on the lower timeframes should be closely monitored throughout the course of the following few days. A rally into the $30K supply zone is the next move, especially if a bullish breakthrough happens above the $23K-$24K range. While many have predicted a rise to the mid-$30,000 area, several analysts have expressed concern that it might just be another fakeout pump. “Weekly Candle Close Above $22,800” Rekt Capital, a cryptocurrency analyst, posted the following chart with the comment that “For the first time in weeks, BTC is putting in a decent effort to try to reclaim the 200-week MA as support.” The analyst has been paying close attention to the move back above the 200-week MA. Related Reading | Mid Cap Crypto Coins Lead In July, Best Way To Weather The Winter? In recent weeks, the 200-week MA has received a lot of attention since it has traditionally acted as a dependable bear market indicator that has given insight into when a bottom has been set. As per Rekt Capital, “BTC needs to Weekly Candle Close above $22800 to successfully confirm a reclaim of the 200-week MA as support.” Miners Capitulate Miners have entered the capitulation phase, who have started to slightly distribute their holdings. The hashrate of Bitcoin has been in a minor downturn following a new all-time high during the previous shakeout, exhibiting the same behavior. Within a 24-hour period, cryptocurrency miners removed up to 14,000 bitcoin, each worth $300 million, from their wallets. Due to the recent decline in the value of many digital currencies, miners sold their bitcoin holdings. Source: CryptoQuant This minor fall in the hashrate is expected given that Bitcoin’s price is currently approximately 74% off its all-time high and that mining may not be profitable for many miners and pools. But despite the current price correction’s size, the hashrate is still doing fairly well. In the past, the bear market’s ultimate phase has been identified by the capitulation of the miners. Therefore, there is a strong likelihood that Bitcoin will soon reach its long-term bottom and start a fresh uptrend toward higher price levels.

42395183,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXSNd,1658266192,The Fed Is Upside-Down on Inflation and That's a Big Risk,"The last time the U.S. suffered a nasty bout of inflation, in the 1980s, the economic emergency was seen as so dire the Federal Reserve, then led by Paul Volcker, jacked up interest rates by as much as three percentage points.  That's about six times the pace seen in a more typical rate-hiking cycle, where the Fed moves in 0.25 percentage-point increments.  “Unless we respond to the increase, which could be quite large in this period, we're going to have a real credibility problem,” Donald Winn, former senior official of the Federal Reserve Board, told Volcker at the Fed meeting in March 1980, according to the meeting transcript.     Eventually, the U.S. central bank's main interest rate was some five percentage points over the inflation rate. The increase induced a sharp recession, but the intent worked: Inflation soon subsided.  Now, there's a similar gap between inflation and the federal funds rate, but the relationship is upside-down.  Inflation surged to a fresh four-decade high of 9.1% last month, and Fed officials are worried although several governors of the U.S. central bank have talked down the prospect of a 1 percentage point rate hike, expressing their preference for a 0.75 percentage point hike.  Such a move would raise the federal funds rate to a range between 2.25% and 2.5%, which would still be at least 6 percentage points below the current headline inflation rate.  Last month, Fed officials published their fresh quarterly economic projections, or “dot plot,” and members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expect the federal funds rate to be at 3.4%, while inflation is forecasted to be at 5.2% by year end.  The point is Fed officials aren't moving with anything close to the urgency seen in the Volcker era. That's a risk, some top economists say.  “We're as close to an inflation emergency as we've been anytime in the past 40 years,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan. “The only thing that's keeping it from being a full-blown, no-holds-barred emergency is that longer-term inflation expectations still seem reasonably well anchored.”  The dynamic is being closely watched in the bitcoin (BTC) market, partly because the price performance of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently been correlated with U.S. stocks. Faster interest-rate hikes will make bonds more attractive to investors. Higher borrowing costs will eat into corporate earnings and slow the pace of investment, which could affect stock prices.  The bitcoin price is down about 49% this year, currently around $23,351.  Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital, recently wrote that the difference between inflation and the federal funds rate is larger than at any point in history. The rate currently sits where it was before the coronavirus pandemic, when inflation was at 2.3%.  On Friday, a University of Michigan survey showed that consumers see inflation running at 2.8% over a five-year horizon, down from an expected 3.1% in June.  However, currently inflation is still running at a four-decade high, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has admitted that the U.S. central bank underestimated the pace of consumer-price rises and was wrong about calling it ""transitory."" He also repeatedly said the economy, thanks to a very hot labor market, is very strong, which is why many market participants predicted a 100 basis-point (one percentage point) hike in July.  The Fed’s current target is to get the federal funds rate to a longer-run neutral rate of 2.5%, but minutes of the last FOMC meeting show that officials plan for rate increases that would take the rate to 3.4% this year.  “I think there's good reasons for 100 or 125 basis points, but I think one of the strongest reasons for 75 basis points is that two 75 basis point hikes get you to neutral and then you can start calibrating from there,” Feroli said.  But these measured calculations are a far cry from the swift, emergency action the Federal Reserve took to slash rates during the market crash of March 2020 because of the pandemic's expected economic impact, or during the financial crisis of 2008.  Vincent Reinhart, a former Fed official who's now chief economist and macro strategist at Dreyfus and Mellon, says that it’s hard to understand how the Fed will bring inflation down if the federal funds rate remains negative throughout the year, as shown in officials' own projections.  Reinhart noted that the Fed risks violating the Taylor principle.  According to the Taylor principle, the real interest rate should be raised “more than one-for-one” when inflation increases, but the rate is currently negative because it is lower than inflation.  “That's a complaint you can have about the Federal Reserve right now,” Reinhart said.  Fear of losing credibility  Another risk of the Fed's light approach could be the fear of losing credibility.  The Fed's use of forward guidance to prepare and control markets for coming rate hikes – an innovation of recent decades – only works as long as investors believe that officials will follow through.  “Powell really, really hates surprising markets,” Reinhart said. “He wants to control the narrative, and he wants to make sure there’s no surprise.”  Last month, Fed officials changed their minds about the level of rate increase at the last minute after a higher-than-expected inflation report. This time they may stick to their initial plan. Fed officials at the end of May signaled that they would likely raise interest rates by 75 basis points in July, given that inflation was expected to accelerate slightly in June. But even though the CPI came in much stronger than forecast, the Fed stuck with its plan.  “I think they probably got some blowback from what appeared to be a bit of choppiness in the last meeting,” JPMorgan’s Feroli said of the Fed. “It didn't appear that there was a steady advance, and I think to go from 75 to 100 basis points may appear choppier. More unstable, perhaps.”  Consistently making decisions before the FOMC meetings even take place also undercuts the importance of the two-day, closed-door discussions.  “The FOMC wants to do multiple things, and they're not all mutually consistent,” Dreyfus and Mellon’s Reinhart said. “You want guidance, you want to convey what you're going to be doing with rates to investors so they can price it in advance. On the other hand, you also want to be responsive to incoming information. If you give guidance that is not described by the incoming information, what do you do?”  “If you change the plan between meetings, are you respecting the consultations of the committee?” he said.  If all goes according to the Fed's plan, inflation will decelerate notably in the fourth quarter, according to Feroli, and if the officials' projections prove accurate, the federal funds rate will be as high as 3.5% by year end.  “So at least in quarterly sequential annualized terms, you will get back to a positive real fed funds rate by the fourth quarter, if not sooner,” he said.  That's a gradual return to normal.

Key technical points: The CVX prices jumped by 2.33% in the last 24 hours. The bull run takes a step back from the 100-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of Convex Finance is $21.91 Million, indicating a rise of 11.75%. Past Performance of CVX The price trend of CVX was enclosed within the resistance trendline and was able to fuel the downtrend by leveraging the 50-day SMA. The bullish reversal from $3.21 with a double bottom pattern ends this bearish trend and breaks the resistance trendline and the opposing SMA. Buyers accomplished their goal by creating a bullish engulfing candle with an increase of 111% in the last three weeks. Source- Tradingview CVX Technical Analysis CVX price chart shows the daily candle struggling to surpass the $7.75 mark and is retracing to hit the support trendline. Additionally, the higher price rejection could indicate a drop of 10%. So, traders can anticipate the price to fall and slow down over the week. The RSI indicator indicates an upswing in fundamental optimism as the slope sustains in the nearly overbought zone. Additionally, the MACD indicator shows slow and fast lines that maintain the bullish trend but with little to no spread. Nonetheless, the technical indicators show a bullish phase in motion and encourage the possibility of an uptrend with the help of the support trendline. In short, CVX technical analysis displays a higher low formation possibility and forecasts a dip to buy. Upcoming Trend The bullish continuation trend could aid in making the value of CVX rise by 25% to reach the $9 mark if the support trendline sustains. In contrast, the 10% reversal to the support trendline could prove fatal if it breaks under the support trendline.

Realized losses, or the losses incurred by selling assets, show the extent of investor capitulation. The magnitude can be charted using blockchain data.  The stablecoin terraUSD (UST) and its companion token LUNA’s collapse in May triggered a wave of realized losses totaling $28 billion over 30 days, according to Glassnode. When crypto prices plunged below the 2017 all-time high on June 18th, realized losses jumped to a record high of $36 billion over 30 days.  As retail and short-term investors are purged from the market during these mass sell-offs, the saturation of ""HODLers,"" or the cohort of price-insensitive long-term investors, swells.

42395189,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXSLf,1658263822,Crypto Mining Hosting Firm Applied Blockchain Stock Surges After 200MW Deal,"The shares of crypto mining hosting provider Applied Blockchain (APLD) more than doubled to $2.13 on Tuesday after the company signed its largest hosting deal ever with bitcoin (BTC) miner Marathon Digital (MARA).  Applied, which went public last year and recently signed a joint venture with Bitmain’s unit Antpool, inked a new five-year, roughly 200 megawatts (MW) deal with Marathon, one of the largest bitcoin mining companies.  “This deal should help ease funding concerns around APLD's expansion plans as Marathon should provide direct capital support as well as improve its financing options,” said Wall Street investment bank DA Davidson’s analyst Chris Brendler in a research note on Tuesday.  Although the terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, Brendler said he got the impression that the deal was a favorable one for the hosting firm, with “attractive all-in economics.”  Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners in which customers can store their crypto mining rigs and mine their preferred digital assets for a fee, without having to build the accompanying infrastructure themselves. All of Marathon’s bitcoin miners are hosted by third-party providers, a business model that the miner calls an “asset-light strategy.”  Hosting demand  In recent months, demand for hosting crypto miners has seen an uptick as infrastructure and power supply-related delays, as well as lack of capital, have caused bottlenecks for miners in expanding their operations, with more mining rigs than places to provide power.  These problems have led to hosting of mining rigs as an attractive alternative to building out an entire mining facility, which several companies are trying to capitalize, including Applied.  Most recently, Luxor Technology, the full-stack bitcoin mining software and services provider, started a marketplace for miners in which customers will be able to purchase hosting services for their mining rigs, citing more demand for hosting facilities.  “With locked-in long-term contracts amid persistently high hosting demand as well as significantly lower equity capital needs, we think APLD is poised to revalue significantly,” said DA Davidson’s Brendler, who reiterated his buy rating on Applied’s stock.

42395190,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXSSY,1658262908,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Breaks Above $23K as Investor Fears Recede,"Hi, I'm Jimmy He, here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  Bitcoin (BTC) broke above $23,000 in Tuesday afternoon trading and was changing hands at around $23,350.  In two days, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has climbed by more than 12% and pushed the price to its highest point since bitcoin collapsed on June 13.  The Crypto Greed & Fear Index, which tracks investors’ cryptocurrency sentiments, moved from “extreme fear” to “fear” and rose 10 points to 30, the highest since April.  Most altcoins gained, with FLOW leading the charts, up 16% over the past 24 hours.  Ether (ETH) also climbed, by 6.9% to around $1,560. The second-largest cryptocurrency has been consistently outperforming bitcoin and hit a high of $1,500 on Monday, breaching its 50-day simple moving average (SMA).  Today’s edition of ""Market Wrap"" was produced by Sage D. Young.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $23,183 +7.8%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,550 +6.4%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,936.69 +2.8%      ●Gold: $1,710 per troy ounce +0.0%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.02% +0.06       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

BTC Finds Support at $20K, Shrugs Off Possibility of 1% Rate Increase for Now  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Macroeconomic headwinds continue to be the order of the day for BTC’s price or, more directly, inflation expectations and the Federal Reserve’s response. An item for investors to keep an eye on is a recent shift in target rate probabilities for the July 27 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.  Per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool (which calculates rate level probabilities for a specific point in time), markets are predicting a 66.8% chance that the FOMC raises interest rates by 0.75% (75 basis points) on July 27. Of note is that seven days prior, that probability stood at 92.4%. Moreover, the probability of a 100 basis point increase in rates moved from 7.6%, to 33.2%. An increase of 100 basis points would likely be received as bearish for crypto prices.  At the moment, bitcoin traders appear to be taking the shift lightly, as BTC prices are up 3.93% intraday. In our view, few U.S. data points exist between now and the July 27 meeting that are likely to affect probabilities. Investors, however, are likely to monitor Thursday’s Initial Jobless Claims data. The current consensus estimate for initial claims is 240,000 versus actual claims of 244,000 for the prior week. We expect that higher-than-expected jobless claims will deter the Federal Reserve from increasing rates more than 0.75%.  From a technical vantage point today’s increase represents the second consecutive day of higher prices, and the sixth day of higher prices over the last seven. Of note is that both today and Monday’s price increases occurred on higher than average volume (when looking at average volume over the most recent 20 trading days).  BTC prices appear to have found support at $20,500 as evidenced by the “high volume node” displayed on the “Visible Range Volume Profile” tool. The VRVP tool displays trading activity at specific price levels over a distinct time period. High volume nodes display price levels where above-average trading volume has occurred, and can serve as indications of support and/or resistance. As implied below, the VRVP shows a visible decline in volume between $25,500 (which we would view as support), and $30,000 (which we would view as resistance).  Also of note is the increase in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is often used as both a proxy for momentum, and an indication of overbought and/or oversold levels. Traditionally, a level of 30 or below implies oversold conditions, while levels of 70 or above indicate overbought conditions. During the last 30 days, the RSI for bitcoin has increased to 61.58 from a level of 20.36. Prices over that identical time period have increased by 23.5%.

This would suggest ETH’s price current price action is a “fakeout”, an uptrend to trap bullish investors into taking long positions before re-testing lower levels. The survey claims ETH’s price could bottom after experiencing another massive crash. The cryptocurrency recorded a yearly low at around $950, but Finder’s experts expect ETH to reach another low at $674.

In that sense, Joseph Raczynski, a technologist, and futurist for Thomson Reuters ETH is still positioned as the best for success. The Merge is not priced into it. The platform it created still supports hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions and value, with thousands of tokens. At this stage, Ethereum is still the blue blood of the crypto world.

Managing director of Digital Capital Management Ben Ritchie believes ETH’s price would continue to trade in tandem with the current macro-economic factors.

Ritchie said: Since Ethereum’s correlation to Bitcoin is still high, we can speculate that if Merge happens before the year-end, its price may decouple. However, the outside economic factor is vital, bringing hurdles to the short-term price action.

This alone is enough for technical analysts to begin watching for follow-through. A buy signal on the RSI is generated after the indicator reclaims the lower threshold at 30, retraces, holds, then pushes past the first high. The signal is clear during the 2018 bear market bottom and told the masses it was time to buy BTC.

Bitcoin Top 10 Exchange Inflows Have Been Elevated In Recent Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the current whale deposits to exchanges are at their highest value in the history of the crypto. The “all exchanges inflow” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin currently entering into wallets of all centralized exchanges. The sum of the top ten inflows, specifically, represents the total number of coins being deposited by BTC whales. When the value of this metric is high, it means whales are currently depositing a large amount of Bitcoin right now. Since investors usually transfer to exchanges for selling purposes, such a trend could point at dumping from whales, and hence can be bearish for the value of the coin. On the other hand, a low value of the metric implies whales are depositing a healthy amount to exchanges at the moment. This kind of trend can be either bullish or neutral for BTC, depending on whether buying is also going on in the market currently.

This suggests that whales are currently depositing to exchanges at a rate never seen before in the history of the crypto.

42395184,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXSMe,1658256941,Stake in Crypto Exchange Deribit Becomes Disputed Asset in Three Arrows Bankruptcy,"As Three Arrows Capital, the troubled crypto hedge fund, struggles through liquidation proceedings in the British Virgin Islands and bankruptcy-court hearings in New York, a behind-the-scenes drama is playing out over the value of a key asset: an indirect stake of nearly 17% in Deribit, the digital-asset industry's preeminent options exchange.  One estimate getting passed around by creditors puts the value as high as $500 million, according to a document shared with CoinDesk by a person who's directly involved in the process.  But the stake may be worth far less.  One reason is that the stake is locked up in a complicated legal structure that might impair Three Arrows’ ability to quickly liquidate the asset, based on a review of corporate filing and court documents. And Three Arrows appears to have used “side letters” over the years to quietly sell off interests in the special purpose vehicle created to hold the Deribit shares.  Another issue is that the private-market valuation of Deribit's shares is believed to have fallen during the recent crypto crash, the person said. And Deribit itself has a claim on Three Arrows that may now be significantly impaired.  According to court filings, the hedge fund owes about $80 million to Deribit, including unpaid loans and negative values in a trading account.  Deribit acknowledged the claim in a tweet on June 16 that also confirmed Three Arrows had been a shareholder in the company since February 2020.  ""Due to market developments, Deribit has a small number of accounts that have a net debt to us that we consider as potentially distressed,"" the options exchange said on Twitter.  The person with knowledge of the matter estimates that Three Arrows' interest in Deribit is now worth as little as $25 million.  The Singapore SPV  The Deribit stake is held through a Singapore-incorporated investment vehicle called 3AC QCP Deribit SPV Pte. Ltd.  The lead investors and two largest shareholders in this SPV are Three Arrows Capital and QCP Soteria Node (QSN), documents show.  According to a corporate filing in Singapore, the directors of the SPV are Three Arrows co-founder Su Zhu along with Darius Sit, co-founder of QCP Capital, and Sherwin Lee, who is founder and director of QCP Soteria Node. According to his LinkedIn profile, Lee also is a venture partner in 3AC QCP Deribit SPV.  There are 31 shareholders listed in the Singapore corporate filing.  One shareholder of the SPV, Kenrick Drijkoningen, is also listed as a creditor in documents released by the BVI liquidator.  Drijkoningen didn't respond to a message sent to his LinkedIn profile.  The person with knowledge of the matter said the SPV holds an estimated 23% stake in Deribit. Three Arrows owns about 70% of the SPV.  But the SPV shares are subject to several material encumbrances.  For one, the owner of the SPV shares cannot sell or transfer the underlying Deribit shares without unanimous consent of all shareholders in the SPV, the person said.  Whoever ends up owning the stake could not remove Sit or Lee, the two non-Three Arrows directors, because they are entrenched under the SPV's corporate rules, the person said.  Plus, the investment firm QCP Soteria Node has a right of first refusal on the deal, under a binding side letter between Three Arrows and QCP Soteria Node, the person said.  Whatever the true market value, the Deribit shares have already become a focal point for creditors trying to recover losses stemming from the Three Arrows meltdown.  Source of security  In documents included in an affidavit submitted as part of the British Virgin Islands liquidation proceedings, an affiliate of the crypto trading firm Genesis Global Trading claimed Three Arrows should deposit the Deribit shares ""into a third-party escrow account for safekeeping pending the resolution of this arbitration.""  According to Genesis, some $462.2 million of additional collateral is owed under trading-loan agreements. (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  ""Genesis is aware that Three Arrows directly or indirectly owns the Deribit shares and the StarkWare shares, which could be sold to pay part of an eventual award against Three Arrows, but in light of Three Arrows' conduct it is likely that Three Arrows will seek to dissipate such shares without legal intervention,"" a lawyer for Genesis Asia Pacific wrote in one of the documents.  A request for comment sent to a media email address for Genesis had not been returned as of press time.

Bankman-Fried said the need to be a “good, constructive actor in this space” justifies “incinerating a small amount of money.”  “The bar is not: Is this a good return on investment?” he said. It’s more about maintaining the health of the wider industry.  FTX and Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research have offered costly rescues to crypto lender BlockFi and crypto broker Voyager Digital amid a broad market downturn, and Bankman-Fried said he's open to helping more.  While FTX has extended millions of dollars to those companies, that hasn’t necessarily succeeded in bailing them out. BlockFi negotiated a deal where FTX could buy the company outright, and Voyager filed for bankruptcy earlier this month. When the Voyager deal came up during a panel discussion, Bankman-Fried laughed and shrugged off the dollars that may have been ""incinerated.""  Bankman-Fried, however, said that the conversations he’s been having with other crypto firms show that many of them aren’t clear about their own financial pictures. That’s the minimum requirement to keep him on the phone, he suggested.  “Step one is literally, ‘Do we know what’s going on?’” he said.  Bankman-Fried also said that FTX was standing ready to start buying bitcoin if the price fell to a certain, unnamed floor.  “We did have real conversations at some point,” he said. “There was a price. We did not hit that price.”  When bitcoin suddenly dove by a third toward $20,000 last month, Bankman-Fried said he was traveling and his first impulse was to race back to his company to help it handle things. But he said this forced stress test proved that the systems FTX created didn’t need any intervention.  “Nothing was on fire,” he said.  In the midst of crypto winter, he said it’s clear that regulations would likely have demanded that firms get properly collateralized in their deals, which would have prevented some of the current contagion.

During a hearing Tuesday, SEC Director of Enforcement Gurbir Grewal told the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets – which oversees the SEC’s enforcement efforts – there have been so many more enforcement actions against crypto companies they are straining the regulator’s nascent crypto unit.  In May, the SEC nearly doubled the size of its Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit to 50 employees, adding 20 new positions including attorneys, investigators and fraud analysts to its Washington, D.C., headquarters. But as the agency continues to ramp up its efforts to police the crypto industry – and the industry is hit with a wave of high-profile bankruptcies – Grewal says he needs more staff.  “Certainly resources are an issue across our division and across the agency,” Grewal said. “The additional resources in the crypto asset unit will help. They include litigators because a number of these cases are in court right now and are a drain on our resources.”  Several subcommittee members brought up the possibility of expanding the SEC Enforcement Division’s allocated resources. When Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) asked Grewal whether his unit had sufficient resources to regulate crypto, Grewal hinted at a potentially massive expansion on the horizon.  “I could always use more resources but we’re making the best with the additional 20 slots and then we’re hopeful to get the 125 additional slots we’ve asked for,” Grewal said.

116623,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=241179,1658255040,3 Ingenious Ways to Make Money From Cryptocurrencies,"Digital currencies are providing lucrative opportunities to retail and institutional investors. Today, the crypto industry has close to 19,000 assets with a cumulative market cap of $825B. The crypto ecosystem is, however, in its earliest development stages since it is a fairly new concept. Many individuals are uncertain about how they can make money with virtual currencies. Investors across the world are taking advantage of common mechanisms like mining, day trading, and holding to maximize profits. The following article, therefore, intends to examine which of the three strategies is more suitable for investors to make money from cryptocurrencies. How to Make Money From Cryptocurrencies Crypto Mining Crypto mining is an income-generating opportunity that rewards miners for validating transactions on a blockchain. Under this mechanism, a group of decentralized computers is responsible for maintaining the public ledger. The process encourages miners to participate in solving complex algorithmic equations. As such, miners with significant computational power have a higher chance of solving the equations. From there, the winning miner is able to update the ledger by adding new blocks to a chain. Performing this activity allows miners to earn a predetermined amount of digital currencies. Bitcoin, for instance, provides miners with a certain amount of BTCs which decreases after every four years. During its initial stages, the mining reward for Bitcoin was 50 BTCs. Going by the asset’s current price, the amount is equivalent to $890k. Today, the block reward is currently at 6.25 BTCs which is equal to $112k. There are several downsides that make mining an inappropriate investment strategy. For one, investors need to have access to sufficient mining energy since the process requires intensive amounts of power. What’s more, the mechanism requires powerful equipment which can be somewhat costly. Such disadvantages make crypto mining a costly venture to undertake. Day Trading Day trading is one of the most popular ways to make money from cryptocurrencies. It represents an investment strategy where users trade digital assets every day. The mechanism enables investors to make profits by entering and exiting the market. Strategies that fall under the day trading mechanism include: Scalping Scalping functions as a short-term investment strategy where users place different types of trades to generate an income. Here, traders take advantage of small gains to accumulate sufficient profits. In some cases, investors may automate their trading with bots to obtain profits within the shortest time possible. Arbitrage Crypto arbitrage involves the act of buying a digital asset from one exchange and selling it to another trading platform. Essentially, arbitrage relies on the discrepancies of one asset across various exchanges. Hence, investors can buy cryptocurrencies at a cheaper price and sell them to another exchange at a higher price. Range Trading Range trading entails the use of support and resistance levels to determine an appropriate trading range. An asset’s support level represents a value that is below its current price while the resistance level reflects a price that’s above the current price. Basically, traders sell digital assets once they reach a resistance level and buy them when they hit a support level. Generally, day trading needs in-depth technical analysis to make the right trading decisions. The strategy heavily relies on constant market research, analyzing chart patterns, and price trends. This requirement could pose a challenge to new traders who want to maximize profits. Holding The third investment strategy is holding, a common practice where investors buy and store digital currencies. Holding serves as a less risky mechanism that requires little or no commitment compared to day trading. More importantly, this exercise helps investors to bypass the effects of crypto volatility. When users hold digital coins, they genuinely believe that the asset in question will become profitable in the future. There are multiple factors that may make an asset favorable for holding. In most cases, users may select an asset based on their use cases and acceptance rate. Like day trading and mining, holding cryptocurrencies has its own downsides which may affect an investor’s earnings. Investors may develop Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt amid their holding journey. As a result, investors end up making little profit as they can sell their holdings at a lower price. The other demerit is that holders will not spend their crypto as a payment medium. Holding discourages the use of virtual coins, thus limiting it to a reserve asset that cannot be used to make payments. This downside could affect the mainstream adoption goal since there is no diversification. Bottomline Millions of users are joining the digital asset economy with a profit-oriented goal. Crypto mining and day trading have complex procedures and requirements that may be challenging to new investors. The mining exercise is expensive since users will need adequate power and mining equipment. On the other hand, day trading requires intensive market research and … Continued The post 3 Ingenious Ways to Make Money From Cryptocurrencies appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform .",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/3-ingenious-ways-to-make-money-from-cryptocurrencies/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=3-ingenious-ways-to-make-money-from-cryptocurrencies,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Gensler mentioned trading and lending platforms that have taken in money and in some cases failed, saying those businesses fall under “classic parts of the securities laws.”  “We at the SEC are going to do what we can,” Gensler said, but added there are currently too many platforms that haven’t properly complied with the law and registered accordingly.  When it comes to the crises faced by many crypto lenders and exchanges recently and what type of regulation is now needed, Gensler said ""it's a mixture of things,"" including collaborating with market participants and reworking some investor protections. And he noted that the SEC needs to be “technology neutral” yet still protect the public.  If crypto is to continue, more trust in the system is necessary, he said. With respect to more regulation, Gensler said the SEC already maintains “a lot of laws on the books that have been there for decades.”  He said many crypto tokens have attributes of being promotional and raising money from the public and promised the SEC will “continue to bring robust enforcement actions.""

115967,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496173,1658253974,5 Best ICO Projects in 2022 – Top Initial Coin Offerings,"If you are interested in finding out which ICOs you should invest in, you’ve landed on the right page. This article lists the top 5 ICO projects and initial coin offerings in 2022. We know ICOs are often hard to grasp. An initial coin offering (ICO) is the crypto equivalent of an IPO, an initial public offering. ICO requires a lot of knowledge and scrutiny to pick the one with minimum risks that will yield a high return on investment. To ease the search, we discovered the top 5 ICO campaigns for 2022. However, there is a solution. This article covers the five best ICO projects in 2022. The best ICO project in 2022 My Freedom Coin – The world’s first crashproof asset with zero-risk loan liquidations. Maxxer – A community-driven decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. KubeCoin – An innovative project designed to bring crypto to the travel and leisure industry. Tetrix Token – The first cryptocurrency compatible with augmented reality technology. BlaBlaGame – The first crypto-based rock, paper, and scissors game. A Closer Look at the 5 Best ICO Projects in 2022 1. My Freedom Coin My Freedom Coin (MFC) is a top initial coin offering as it’s the only existing cryptocurrency project with a Floor Price. All fees generated from platform usage contribute to the appreciation of the coin. With the Floor Price of MFC only going higher, My Freedom Coin is the only crashproof cryptocurrency that can minimize any negative volatility within the market for its holders. Additionally, it is the only platform that can offer BUSD loans with zero liquidation risks! Built on the Binance Smart Chain, My Freedom Coin is an all-in-one DeFi platform that is a wallet, an exchange service, and a bank. It allows users to store cryptocurrency, exchange crypto into MFC, and take out BUSD loans using MFC as collateral. The Floor Price is created via all assets held inside the BUSD Treasury. Therefore, no matter what happens within the overall market, the BUSD inside the treasury will always be available to buy all the coins in circulation at the current Floor Price. The treasury is filled through a series of higher consecutive coin offerings until all 7 billion tokens are released into circulation. Each new coin offering releases MFC at 2x the Floor Price, bringing it higher each time. In addition, fees generated from platform usage also contribute to the evaluation of the token. For example, exchanging MFC on the P2P exchange incurs a 2% transaction fee to both buyers and sellers. For buyers, the 2% is charged in MFC and is taken out of circulation, increasing the Floor Price. To access the exchange, traders must acquire a Trading License. The fee for the license is set at $0 but will increase by $5 for every new 10,000 users until it rises to $50. Any transactions sending MFC from wallet-to-wallet also have a small 0.5% fee, which is removed from circulation. Furthermore, My Freedom Coin provides a decentralized loan service, allowing users to secure BUSD loans from the treasury using MFC as collateral. Users are charged an interest rate of 0.98% per month in MFC, which is removed from circulation. Follow My Freedom Coin on Twitter or join the conversation on Discord. My Freedom Coin is free to download on iOS and Android. However, it is an invite-only community, so you will need to scan the following QR code to gain access to the platform; CODE: ABXNMMXPHN If you’re after a DeFi platform genuinely owned by its users with unique economics, then My Freedom Coin is the only place to visit. VISIT MY FREEDOM COIN TODAY 2. Maxxer – $MXXR Token Wouldn’t it be great to be able to trade digital assets and, at the same time, make high-profile “crypto” friends? Now you can if you invest and believe in Maxxer. Maxxer is the first community-driven decentralized crypto exchange, with social trading at its core. The new regulated exchange service focuses on making crypto investments and trading easy and understandable. Maxxer introduces new functionalities to enhance the experience alongside the classic exchange features. Social trading is Maxxer’s top priority. It enables users to observe the activities of other participants and follow or copy their decisions. The Maxxer community allows you to discover the best traders and follow them to keep track of their choices. Moreover, you can interact with experienced traders and learn from them. The platform also features gamification, the Social Trading League, to make things more entertaining. The league allows you to find the best traders. If you become a social trader, you can climb five levels and earn valuable rewards. The project offers its native token, $MXXR, and provides discounts on fees. This is a significant incentive that should guarantee a consistent volume of $MXXR token and help it grow at the same rate as Maxxer’s exchange service itself. 3. KubeCoin – KUBE Token KubeCoin is an innovative virtual currency aiming to bring groundbreaking changes to the travel and leisure industry. One of the objectives of the KubeCoin ICO project is to integrate cryptocurrencies into the everyday life of a wide range of users. However, the main idea behind KUBE is not only offering a new digital asset. Kube Coin project wants to create an entire crypto ecosystem comprising several pioneering projects. These include KubePay, the proprietary wallet, EatKube with various surprises changing the overall dining experience, and the NFT platform. Furthermore, the ecosystem also has the NFT project with unique NFTs. The collection of KubeCoin’s NFTs allows users to access exclusive events, special deals, and other attractive benefits. KubeCoin is a decentralized DeFi token founded in 2021 as the primary digital asset in the Kube Ecosystem. The entire hub strives to establish KUBE as the main currency used for travel expenses in the real world. Moreover, the company wants to create the Kube Group featuring KubeCoin as the standard currency in the travel industry. A startup backing the KUBE ICO project was founded in 2017, having a total gross profit of €5,000,000. 4. Tetrix Token – XTR XTR token, or Tetrix, is the cornerstone of a global data-driven platform. Tetrix token implements the TRC20 standard of the TRON network. XTR is a cryptocurrency designed to be fully compatible with the metaverse augmented reality ecosystem. It allows you to send and receive money using the latest metaverse technology. XTR VR box is a high-performance, blockchain-powered technology development platform. The platform is created to support a daily volume of around $10 million from more than 4,000 daily active users. Tetrix token (XTR) is a new digital currency created for the augmented reality system. The social element of the new platform connects traders and early adopters. Tetrix launched the ICO with a goal to link businesses, employees, and assets into a single blockchain-based ecosystem that facilitates business activities. Tetrix token will enable quick and secure transfers. The new crypto will leverage TRON’s idea of decentralized Internet that makes TRON the top-notch platform facilitating the development of blockchain apps. XTR will utilize TRON’s scalability and high throughput to offer its clients the best user experience. One of the future products is also an all-in-one DEX Wallet. The XTR team comprises 11 members. TRON Arcade Fund has invested funds in the new Tetrix ICO project. 5. BlaBlaGame – BLA Token Finally, let’s have some fun with the first crypto Rock Paper Scissors game. BlaBlaGame.io has set an ambitious goal for this ICO project. The team that developed the game expects it will attract thousands of players within the first few months after the official rollout. The game currently has almost 1,000 users who’ve played over 13,700 games. The winner receives a reward with a 3% fee deducted from the total amount. Here is where the new token, BLA, comes in handy. If you use BLA, the fee you’ll pay is 2.2%. The fee is allocated to the daily and monthly prize pools, daily cashback, and other rewards. To reach a new level, you need to win a certain number of games and collect enough BLA tokens. The maximum is 1,000,000 tokens for the final “To the Moon” level. BLA token is issued on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-20 standard. Closing Thoughts My Freedom Coin is considered to be one of the true crashproof assets in the crypto industry whose floor price is claimed to provide a level of security for all MFC holders. According to the project, the rise in floor price, and meeting the purchase cost of MFC could potentially make the investment risk-free. Other ICO options mentioned above are also worth considering as they all cater to different verticals and come with their own utility and growth potential. But remember to carefully read the white papers of the project you’re interested in and conduct your due diligence.

""The fundamentals of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in any viable investment thesis hasn't changed,"" he said during the 2022 Bloomberg Crypto Summit. Mallers' remarks come as the crypto space experiences one of its most tumultuous drawdowns in its short history, though, ""it's risk-off in everything,"" Mallers said, adding that ""everyone's scared"" across a slew of asset classes amid deepening recession fears and the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy. In response to a question about bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) intensive energy consumption, Mallers said ""using energy is not a bad thing"" even though regulators are increasingly scrutinizing crypto miner's use of fossil-fuel-based Proof-of-Work blockchains like bitcoin. That's where a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism comes into play given its substantially less energy use and more security than PoW. Note that ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is expected to transition to PoS from PoW in a bid that could improve transaction speeds and well as scalability on the blockchain. ""Since when is using energy a bad thing,"" Mallers asked rhetorically, citing how nobody complains about how much energy airplanes or washing machines take up. Regulators concerns about bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) energy use is ""absolutely asinine and ridiculous,"" he said.

42421480,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoUk1,1658252959,Is the Ethereum ‘Merge’ Driving This Rally?,"Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is up 45% over the week, outpacing most other assets you can bet on. There might be an easy explanation here:  Traders are turning bullish as Ethereum’s cadre of developers near the end of a multiyear, hyper-complicated upgrade.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Nathaniel Whittemore, an influential podcaster and committed industry observer, suggested as much in his latest episode of “The Breakdown.” On Twitter, Discord and all the other places people discuss crypto, there’s a growing acknowledgement that “the Merge” could drive markets.  The market rally began last week, after Ethereum developer Tim Beiko proposed Sept. 19, during an open developer’s call for the network to finally switch from proof-of-work, an energy intensive way to secure blockchains, to the environmentally friendlier proof-of-stake protocol.  The event signals, as Whittemore suggested, a “return of optimism” in crypto markets after a monthslong slog of depressed prices. Moreover, the Merge is filling a “narrative void,” the stories crypto folks can tell others about how this technology is reshaping the world.  The usefulness of narratives  Narratives are useful for people to coordinate actions alongside shared beliefs. But they can also be dangerous delusions, like Three Arrows Capital co-founder Su Zhu’s idea of “the supercycle,” the idea that the most recent crypto rally was sustainable.  Countless firms fed capital to Zhu’s hedge fund partly because of that idea, only to see 3AC implode after the crushing reality of several bad trades and a souring market.  There are some reasons for optimism about Ethereum: Namely, the Merge would be the most sophisticated upgrade in the digital asset industry’s 14-year history. It would move ETH to a less environmentally taxing system and improve the functionality of the most-used blockchain. It could also put crypto in the news under a positive light.  Others see structural reasons for how the Merge could catalyze prices. The upgrade is a structural shift in how Ethereum could be used – rewarding holders who stake their assets with the network. The shift could even create Bitcoin-like deflationary pressures that further reward holders. In this scenario, people who are buying ETH now in anticipation may see it more as an investment than a trade.  See also: The 'Merge Trade' Has Begun, Experts Say, as Ether Surges  “There’s going to be virtually no sell pressure when the Merge happens. Everyone who’s staking is locked up, everyone remaining with their money in stETH is holding until it repegs, anyone who had their money on Voyager or Celsius is locked in bankruptcy proceedings for 5-10yrs,” crypto commenter Ethereum Jesus tweeted, referring to the bankruptcy filings of crypto broker Voyager and crypto lender Celsius Network.  As with all narratives, none of this must be true for people to believe or trade. There’s a growing acknowledgement that people could “buy the news” of the Merge in a supreme example of the feedback loops that drive many crypto pumps.  Still, a risky trade  The hope is that a “dump” won't follow. The Merge represents the culmination of years of work, countless brain cycles, nearly immeasurable testnets and ETH’s biggest backer’s commitment to not only improving the network, but also to ensuring it might stand the test of time.  That’s the story people could be buying. It’s important, however, to acknowledge that this event is still a risky trade and that there are long-term regulatory and technological risks crypto faces.  Whittemore began his show discussing how crypto, “alongside every asset class,” is subject to wider macroeconomic forces like the U.S. Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflation and a potential recession.  “Crypto is not immune,” Whittemore said, and a “true bull market” likely won’t return until the Fed ends tightening.

Three Arrows Capital, previously a large holder of the shares, has fully liquidated its position. Grayscale is suing the SEC for yet another ETF conversion rejection and the Wall Street Journal seems to be siding with Grayscale. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the flagship fund in Grayscale's digital product portfolio. It accounts for a little over $13 billion of the $17 billion in AUM that Grayscale has in its single asset funds. Over the last couple years, I've covered GBTC two times. The first time was in late 2019 when I was highly critical of the fund's management fee, marketing approach, and premium to NAV. The second time was 13 months later . The reason for writing the follow up was because I had changed my mind. That article is now a year and a half old. The setup is very different for GBTC at this point so I feel an update is warranted. The Discount Rate What was still a 6% premium to NAV in January 2021 when I last covered the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is now a 30% discount. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was $31k when I wrote that article. Down 32% since then, the price action in Bitcoin has been pretty bad. For GBTC though, it's been even worse; down from just under $33 per share to $14. This price action also turned what had been a premium to net asset value for most of the fund's existence into a sizable discount. Grayscale The discount to net asset value is now roughly 30% in GBTC shares. That GBTC discount rate is actually so steep at this point, that many of Grayscale's altcoin funds actually have less severe discount rates than GBTC and even price premiums in some cases: Fund Ticker Fund Asset Holdings Share Value Share Price Premium Rate ( ETCG ) ( ETC-USD ) $235.05M $12.95 $5.97 -53.90% ( OTCQB:GBAT ) ( BAT-USD ) $2.32M $3.77 $1.80 -52.25% ( OTCQX:LTCN ) ( LTC-USD ) $86.59M $4.69 $2.46 -47.55% ( OTCQX:HZEN ) ( ZEN-USD ) $10.32M $1.43 $1.00 -30.07% GBTC BTC-USD $13.28B $19.50 $13.69 -29.79% ( OTCQX:ETHE ) ( ETH-USD ) $4.14B $12.55 $9.35 -25.50% ( OTCQX:BCHG ) ( BCH-USD ) $34.51M $0.95 $0.75 -21.05% ( OTCQX:ZCSH ) ( ZEC-USD ) $20.02M $5.31 $4.55 -14.31% ( OTCQX:GXLM ) ( XLM-USD ) $8.04M $9.87 $8.56 -13.27% ( LPT )"" target=""_blank"">OTCQB:GLIV ) (LPT-USD) $5.42M $8.05 $8.00 -0.62% ( OTCQX:MANA ) ( MANA-USD ) $15.43M $8.20 $9.50 15.85% ( OTCQB:GLNK ) ( LINK-USD ) $1.98M $6.18 $13.50 118.45% ( FIL )"" target=""_blank"">OTCQB:FILG ) ( FIL-USD ) $614.26K $5.19 $17.00 227.55% Source: Grayscale, as of 7/15 close Two of the biggest factors driving GBTC's price action are likely the 3AC liquidation and the SEC's repeated denials of Grayscale's ETF conversion application. Three Arrows Capital Sells Out Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, was once a very large holder of GBTC. That crypto-focused investment fund was forced to liquidate its GBTC position when the crypto market unraveled. The unwinding of what was 5% of GBTC's outstanding shares by one entity resulted in a large increase in GBTC's traded volume during the week of June 13th. You can see that week's volume indicated in the chart below with a darker shade of green: Yahoo Finance After market close on Friday June 10th, the average daily session volume for that week was 3.7 million shares. But the following week when 3AC is believed to have liquidated its GBTC position, the average daily volume spiked up to 11.4 million shares and the price of the shares tumbled from $18.68 down to $12.47. In my weekly Digital Market Overview for BlockChain Reaction subscribers, I said this on Monday June 20th: There was a lot of attention given to the fact that GBTC had made a new discount low late last week. Don't be surprised to see big green candles today in the Grayscale tickers now that 3AC seems to be liquidated of its GBTC position. While the price of the shares didn't deviate too far from $13, after news of 3AC's Grayscale share liquidation spread, the volume spikes in GBTC during the following week's early sessions were enormous. June 21st and 22nd saw nearly 60 million combined shares traded. This was about 3x more than the average daily volume from the week prior and about 8x the average daily volume from the first full week in June. The 3AC liquidation was a major catalyst in that volume activity and may have been a capitulation signal to the market. The SEC and the WSJ The second issue that is likely exacerbating the discount rate is the repeated denials of GBTC's ETF conversion applications by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most recent application denial came in late June and was followed by Grayscale suing the SEC on the same day of the rejection. Grayscale believes the SEC is acting in bad faith and is exercising arbitrary application of securities law when it comes to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Conventional wisdom suggests a spot Bitcoin ETF will help drive more safe investment demand in Bitcoin from institutions. The SEC, currently led by Gary Gensler, has repeatedly denied requests for spot ETFs but has allowed Bitcoin futures ETFs. The Wall Street Journal recently published an editorial board opinion piece about Gensler and how GBTC's ETF conversion plans continue to be blocked by the SEC. The WSJ didn't hold any punches in its criticism of Gensler. The editorial board started with aggressive tone right out of the gate: Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has his regulatory eye on cryptocurrency markets, and he’s taking investors hostage in the process. That’s the best way to explain the agency’s blockade of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products, or ETPs. The editorial also pointed out why it's silly to have a futures ETF without a spot ETF. If accusing Gensler of holding investors hostage isn't spicy enough, the real heat may have been in the final paragraph: Members of Congress in both parties have sent letters to Mr. Gensler inquiring about his hold-up. Maybe they should call him to explain why he’s undermining crypto innovation and investor protections—and remind him who controls the agency’s purse-strings. I think this is important. We now have a major financial opinion-driving publication that is calling out both a regulatory body and the chair overseeing that body. It's a big deal and I think it adds credence to Grayscale's polarizing decision to sort it out through litigation. We'll see how that plays out. In the meantime, another ETF conversion has been denied and might therefore be priced in from a discount to NAV perspective. Risks Grayscale's Bitcoin trust is probably one of the most risky ways to buy Bitcoin. It's a derivative that charges a large management fee while offering no redemption and you can't trade it outside of normal market hours. If you're a HODLer, GBTC isn't the way to do that. Additionally, private placement is currently closed, so as Grayscale continues to take its management fee out of the fund via BTC holding decay, Grayscale is seemingly a net seller of Bitcoin at this point in time. GBTC total holdings declining (Coinglass) Furthermore, Grayscale is now entering a legal fight with the SEC. That is a fight that has the potential to be both expensive and damaging to Grayscale in the eyes of US regulators. Summary What GBTC does offer investors is a tax-advantaged way to get exposure to Bitcoin whether it converts to an ETF or not. I personally hold GBTC shares in a Roth IRA. That means any potential realized gains on Bitcoin holdings through the shares of the fund won't be taxed. I think that's a strong reason to look at GBTC despite the management fee. Furthermore, if you like the fund at a small premium (as I did in January 2021), you love it at a 30% discount. In my last article covering Bitcoin for Seeking Alpha, I made the case for why I believed the market sentiment was getting too one-sided. I still very much hold that view and believe that even if the cycle bottom isn't in yet, Bitcoin has yet to benefit from a meaningful bear market rally since giving up $48k in March. After the liquidation of a top shareholder, I think GBTC shares at a 30% discount are a solid way to long Bitcoin for a potential rally in the spot price.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4524242-gbtc-if-you-liked-it-at-premium-love-it-30-percent-discount?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/114135.jpeg

The token, which is an offshoot of the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has been suffering due to the bear trend that has been plaguing the market. But as the sentiment has begun to turn, Ethereum Class (ETC) has emerged as one of the biggest winners of the last week. Ethereum Classic Adds 80% Ethereum Classic’s recovery in the last week has been nothing short of miraculous. Where other cryptocurrencies have been posting gains below 50%, the altcoin has surged more than 80% in the last 7 days alone. More specifically, Ethereum Classic (ETC) is up 83.505, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Related Reading | Bitcoin Marks One Month Of Negative Funding Rates, More Decline Incoming? This recovery has taken the price of the digital asset and catapulted it into the mid $20s. After spending most of last week trending around $14, the price is now up almost 100% in this time period. In the same vein, the total market cap of the cryptocurrency has climbed. It added more than $1 billion to its market cap in the last two days alone, to be sitting at its current level of $3.97 billion at the time of this writing. It is no surprise that the altcoin is surging at this time. It has always shown a tendency to follow the price movements of Ethereum. However, the margin by which it is surging above its predecessor has been wide, showing a deviation from this usual correlation. ETC market cap crosses $3 billion | Source: Market Cap ETC on TradingView.com ETC Is Not Done Yet The indicators for Ethereum Classic (ETC) point to more steam in the current rally. An example is the fact that the digital asset over the last couple of days. It has consistently closed in the green in the last three days, and the indicators point to another green close for ETC. Related Reading | Liquidations Cross $230 Million As Ethereum Barrels Past $1,400 Another daily close above $25 will likely see the price rally to $30 before the week is over. This will bring its recovery over the last one week to more than 100%. Its 100-day moving average is just under $27, so a cross to $30 would put it higher above this level, as well as higher than its year-to-date moving average. This will cement its bull trend over the next week. There is still significant sell pressure mounting up as investors are taking out some profit. However, support is forming at $25, which gives it a soft landing if it is unable to break the $27 resistance. Also, if Ethereum’s recovery continues, then support will continue to pour in for Ethereum Classic, pushing its price further.

42395182,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXSKg,1658250000,Blockchain Music Service Audius to Allow Users to Tip Artists Using Audio Token,"Web3 music streaming service Audius is offering a new feature for creators to monetize their content by allowing listeners to send tips to artists, the company said Tuesday.  With audio, the governance token of the Audius platform, users can send tips to any artist who publishes their music on the platform, whether they have a large following or not.  Audius, a platform serving seven million listeners and 250,000 artists, caters to artists who want to share their most exclusive content for their biggest fans on the blockchain. Now, it’s taking the platform it has grown since 2018 in the direction of creator monetization to support artists in new ways, Audius co-founder and CEO Roneil Rumburg told CoinDesk.  “We're not necessarily trying to attract 100% of somebody's fan base from a different platform. We're trying to attract maybe the top 10 most engaged superfans,” the ones who will tip their favorite artists, said Forrest Browning, Audius co-founder and chief product officer.  Earlier this year, Audius introduced audio rewards for users to earn tokens by following artists, creating playlists or uploading songs. Fans can now use those tokens to send tips to artists, or connect an external crypto wallet. Audius plans to allow tipping in fiat currency via credit cards in the coming months, according to Browning.  “We kind of see it as laying out the breadcrumbs to help our mainstream, Web2 audience start to understand how to tip and how to support their favorite artists and a Web3 ecosystem,” said Browning.  But tipping isn’t just a one-way street. Artists can react to fans’ tips with emojis to show their thanks. And fans’ tips will display in their profile, as well as on a public leaderboard for artists’ biggest tippers.  Audius, built on the Ethereum and Solana chains, has been making significant strides in the Web3 music scene. In December, the streaming platform partnered with crypto game DeFi Land to create a radio station in the metaverse. In September, the platform raised $5 million from musicians Katy Perry, The Chainsmokers and Pusha T.  The audio token is Ethereum-based, but has a Solana bridge for transaction speed and cost efficiency. According to data from CoinGecko, the token currently trades at 39 cents with a market cap of $281 million. In August, its market cap surpassed $1 billion following the announcement of its TikTok collaboration.

In an update, the announcement follows the recent release of Juno, a Cosmos-based open and decentralized layer-1 protocol for cross-chain smart contracts designed to promote interoperability. The Fetch-ai Network development team views SubQuery as a valuable partner. Integrating the indexing provider into its fast-growing ecosystem will free valuable time and resources for Fetch-ai Network projects, allowing developers to focus on product development and enhancing user experience, making them deliver their vision mission and key milestones faster. Technically, all dApp developers in Fetch-ai Network and other networks must access blockchain data quickly and reliably. SubQuery is designed to be reliable and open so that dependent projects can readily access data. In this manner, SubQuery has emerged as a critical cog in crypto and dApp development whose service offerings would massively complete Fetch-ai Network’s wide range of toolchains. Accordingly, Kamal Ved, the Chief Product Officer at Fetch-ai Network, is confident the blockchain will grow to become a choice platform for dApp builders. “Fast access to blockchain data is paramount for Fetch’s compute-intensive AI and agent-based automation products. Our integration with SubQuery’s indexing solution nicely supplements the rest of our toolchain to support our aspirations to solve complex coordination challenges with AI and automation and make Fetch-ai Network Network a great choice for dApp builders to develop and launch their applications.” SubQuery is rapidly expanding to provide data indexing solutions across the Cosmos ecosystem via Juno, a data indexing solution purposely designed for the Cosmos network. Developers leveraging SubQuery will now focus on growth and scaling their products. They will enjoy the broad spectrum of SubQuery experience, including accessing open source SDK, tools, and even eligibility to the SubQuery Grants Program. Notably, because Fetch-ai Network is accommodated by SubQuery’s managed service that provides enterprise-level infrastructure hosting capable of handling over 400 million requests daily, developers will access enhanced services. The launch of Juno and SubQuery’s expansion across the Cosmos ecosystem precedes the launch of the decentralized and open-source SubQuery Network. The blockchain will adhere to blockchain principles and will be accessible to all users and projects. However, the network will specifically aim to innovate in payments and critically support all Fetch-ai Network projects upon launch. In late June, Fetch-ai Network announced the release of DabbaFlow, a data sharing platform, a solution that gives users control of their data and privacy.

ETH’s price currently leads the market recovery as it records a 40% profit in the past seven days trading at $1,500. Related Reading | Solana Adds 70% More Shine – Can SOL Keep The Light Coming? On the other hand, BTC’s price is more conservative but has begun recording important gains. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $22,800 with a 14% profit over the same period and is on track to securing further gains. As a result of the bullish momentum, the Fear and Greed Index has broken out of its 74-day streak moving to extreme fear levels, according to a report from Arcane Research. Again, this confirms the profitability of taking long positions when this Index consolidates around those levels. As seen in the chart below, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has returned to its Q1 2022 levels. This indicator plummeted in May when the price of Bitcoin broke below the $30,000 barrier and into a multi-year low at around $17,500. Despite the current bullish momentum, the Index is still gravitating in fear territory suggesting BTC, ETH, and the crypto market will need to follow the Index and reclaim its Q1 2022 prices before more market participants turn more optimistic. Arcane Research noted the following: While the sentiment is improving, the Fear and Greed Index remains deep in the fearful territory, and other viable sentiment indicators from the derivatives market suggest that market participants still exercise caution. The chart above suggests the sector is at a turning point as it pushes above 30 in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index. A break above these levels could confirm a change in the current market trend. Why The Crypto Market Could Seize This Window Of Opportunity In the short term, the crypto market has a chance to extend the bullish momentum. The factors pushing BTC and ETH into yearly lows seem to be mitigating. These include the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) trying to stop inflation by hiking interest rates. The financial institution has entered a blackout period, meaning its representatives won’t make public statements until the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), seems poised to slow down. As NewsBTC reported, this metric experienced a 40-year hike but might take a step back as oil, copper, and others trend to the downside. The CPI print relies heavily on the price of commodities.

42395171,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXSAq,1658245172,"'Singapore-based' Crypto Firms Leading Market Meltdown Were Not Regulated, Central Bank Chief Says","Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), says troubled crypto firms reported by the media as being based in Singapore are not fully regulated in the country.  Menon focused in particular on crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and Singapore-registered companies TerraForm Labs and Vauld during a press briefing for the presentation of the central bank's annual report.  ""In reality, these so-called “Singapore-based” crypto firms have little to do with crypto-related regulation in Singapore,"" Menon said.  Crypto markets have shed around $2 trillion in a matter of weeks during the recent market downturn, prompting Singapore – a jurisdiction that took a leading role in setting up a regulatory framework for crypto companies – to harden its position on digital assets.  The MAS, the country's central bank, is continuing to distance itself from embattled crypto firms with ties to the Southeast Asian nation. In June, the MAS reprimanded Singapore-born Three Arrows Capital, which is currently facing liquidation, for allegedly misleading regulators with false information and exceeding the threshold of assets it could manage in Singapore.  Menon said the fund was not regulated under the country's Payment Services Act.  ""It had operated under the registered fund management regime to carry out limited fund management business, but had ceased to manage funds in Singapore prior to the problems leading to its insolvency,"" Menon said.  TerraForm Labs and the Luna Foundation, responsible for the collapsed stablecoin terraUSD (UST), are not licensed or regulated by MAS, according to Menon. TerraForm Labs is a Singapore-registered company but its address is of a registration agent that houses hundreds of Singaporean companies.  Menon also said crypto firm Vauld, which suspended transactions in early July and has a registration address in Singapore, is currently not licensed by MAS but has submitted a license application, which is pending review.  The central bank chief also said that most crypto regulators to date have focused on containing money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and that regulations do not cover consumer protection, market conduct or reserve backing for stablecoins.  ""This is changing. Reviews and public consultations are underway among international standard-setting bodies and regulators to strengthen regulation in these areas,"" Menon said. He said the bank will consult on proposed measures in the coming months.  Menon said the bank will take ""firm enforcement action"" if any company is caught providing regulated services without a license. MAS will be ""brutal and unrelentingly hard"" on bad behavior in the crypto industry, Sopnendu Mohanty, the bank's chief fintech officer, said in June.

42395191,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXSTX,1658245072,Ether Breaches 50-Day Average for First Time Since April; Bitcoin Lags,"Ether (ETH) has topped a key technical level for the first time in three months, leaving market leader bitcoin (BTC) behind.  However, one analyst tracking price chart patterns cautions against expecting rapid ether price rallies.  Ether moved above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) on Monday, hitting a one-month high above $1,500. The cryptocurrency traded at $1,525 at press time, with the 50-day SMA at $1,327. Bitcoin remained below its 50-day SMA at $23,000.  While chart-based traders and analysts typically read crossovers above the 50-day SMA as a sign of a positive shift in the momentum, ether's latest breakout may be different, according to Katie Stockton, a chartered market technician and founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies.  ""Ether has cleared its 50-day [S]MA, improving sentiment behind altcoins [alternative cryptocurrencies], but the bounce may be fleeting with short-term overbought conditions having returned,"" Stockton wrote in a client note late Monday. ""The downtrend remains intact, with prices below the daily [Ichimoku] cloud model.""  The Ichimoku Cloud, created by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda in the late 1960s, comprises two lines – the leading span A and the leading span B. Both lines are plotted 26 days ahead of the last candle to indicate future support or resistance. Crossovers above or below the cloud are widely taken to represent early signs of a bullish or bearish trend change.  As of writing, ether traded within the Ichimoku Cloud identified by the area between the leading span A and the leading span B. Any move above the leading span B would be needed to confirm the cloud breakout.  ""Ether needs more significant improvement in intermediate-term momentum to convince us a lasting turnaround is underway,"" Stockton noted, citing the lack of major price support between $1,000, the psychological level, and the September 2020 high of $490 as a risk to the cryptocurrency.  In other words, there is plenty of downside possible should ether fall below $1,000 – more so since long-term indicators remain bearish.  ""From a long-term perspective, a bear market cycle has a hold with negative momentum according to the monthly MACD and stochastics,"" Stockton wrote.  The weekly chart ""moving average convergence-divergence"" (MACD) histogram printed negative values as of writing, indicating a persistent bearish bias. The MACD is an indicator used to gauge trend strength and identify trend changes. MACD's crossover below zero implies a bullish-to-bearish trend change and vice versa.  Stochastics, a popular indicator for generating overbought and oversold signals, signaled oversold conditions with a below-20 print. However, oversold does not imply a trend reversal higher and indicators can stay oversold longer than dip buyers can stay solvent.  Despite the latest bounce, ether was nursing a 58% year-to-date loss, compared to bitcoin's 51%.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/19/ether-breaches-50-day-average-for-first-time-since-april-bitcoin-lags,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/834c0b8fb7329f46767604a270cfa6903de99f1a-1437x1078.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

U.S. officials believe the hackers either extorted the money from U.S.-based health care organizations or used the money to launder ransom payments.  The North Korean hackers targeted medical providers in Kansas and Colorado last year, encrypting computer systems that operated key equipment, Monaco said. The incidents came to the attention of U.S. officials when an unnamed medical provider in Kansas reported them to the FBI.  The Kansas complaint helped the FBI identify a new type of ransomware used by the North Koreans and allowed the bureau to seize ransom payments and cryptocurrencies from China-based money launderers hired by the North Koreans, according to Monaco. She urged other U.S. organizations and companies to report similar incidents to the FBI.  The seizures were aided by investments that the FBI, Secret Service and Treasury Department have made in tracking crypto payments to cybercriminal groups, according to Monaco.  Earlier this year, the FBI assembled a new task force of cryptocurrency experts that focuses on blockchain analysis and digital money seizures.  In March, the U.S. government linked North Korean state-sponsored hacker Lazarus Group to a $625 million theft of cryptocurrency from the Ronin bridge linked to popular play-to-earn game Axie Infinity.

42395187,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASXSQa,1658244600,Fedi to Build Privacy-Focused Bitcoin Mobile App on Fedimint Protocol,"Fedi Inc. has closed a $4.2 million seed round to fund development of the Fedi mobile app built on the Bitcoin custody protocol Fedimint. The round was led by Kingsway Capital, ego death capital and Ten31. Trammell Venture Partners, Hivemind VC, Time Chain, Recursive Capital and Steve Lee also participated.  A common refrain among bitcoiners is “Not your keys, not your coins.” In short, if you are not holding the private keys to your bitcoin – that is, “self-custodying” them – and are allowing a third party like an exchange to take care of them, then you do not truly “own” your bitcoin (BTC). But self-custody carries with it a weight of responsibility and a level of technological expertise that some newcomers to the Bitcoin protocol can find intimidating.  Fedi’s overarching objective is to overcome three of the biggest obstacles to bitcoin adoption today – lack of secure custody, privacy and scalability – all of which are addressed by the open-source Fedimint bitcoin custody protocol. Fedi’s mobile app will be a bitcoin wallet built on top of that protocol, which means, in theory, the app may turn out to be a viable solution for securing your bitcoin.  “Fedi is global bitcoin adoption technology. We want to see billions of people using bitcoin. Once we get to a million users, it's only a matter of time before we get to 10 million, then 100 million, then a billion,” said Fedi CEO and co-founder Obi Nwosu.  Fedi’s three founders, Nwosu, Eric Sirion and Justin Moon, are prominent members of the bitcoin community. Nwosu founded and operated U.K.-based bitcoin-only exchange, Coinfloor, until its recent sale in late 2021. Sirion has a background in computer science and prior to co-founding Fedi, received sponsorship from Bitcoin infrastructure firm Blockstream to conduct research on Fedimint. Moon is a popular Bitcoin developer and educator known for his Bitcoin courses and bootcamps. The app is set to launch in early 2023.  Read more: UK's Oldest Crypto Exchange to Delist Ethereum and Focus Solely on Bitcoin  What is Fedimint?  “Fedimint” is an abbreviation of the words, “federated” and “mint.” The concept was originally conceived in 1983 by renowned computer scientist and cryptographer, David Chaum, and later used to create e-cash, a primordial, albeit centralized, version of today’s cryptocurrencies. E-cash used blind signatures to preserve user privacy. Blind signatures allow a sender’s message to be cryptographically blinded (or hidden) before being digitally signed by the recipient, thereby preserving the sender’s anonymity.  Fedi’s other co-founder, Sirion, was fascinated by these early developments and contemplated adding two key components from the Bitcoin ecosystem to Chaum’s e-cash protocol. The first component was the idea of federations – pre-existing groups of Bitcoin users with high levels of trust in each other (for example, family members, friends, and community groups). The second component was the use of multisignature functionality to solve e-cash’s centralization flaw. Incorporating these components into Chaum’s original idea gave birth to Fedimint – a community-based Bitcoin custody protocol.  “We already have a protocol for decentralized censorship-resistant money – that’s Bitcoin. We also have a protocol for decentralized censorship-resistant payments – that's Lightning. The final missing piece is a decentralized, censorship-resistant custody protocol,” said Nwoso. That protocol is Fedimint.  Fedimint accepts bitcoin deposits and returns minted tokens to the federation member making the deposit. The number of tokens minted for each bitcoin is based on a predetermined rate set by the federation. Tokens can then be used off-chain to pay for goods and services, or simply exchanged between members. This off-chain activity allows for scaling beyond Bitcoin’s on-chain constraints.  Furthermore, like its e-cash predecessor, Fedimint provides full anonymity by using blind signatures to ensure users cannot be linked to the minting process that created their tokens.  Finally, the protocol uses multisignature functionality to distribute wallet custody among trusted federation members called “guardians.” Imagine an extended family with 20 members, some of whom are technologically sophisticated. If most of the members are uncomfortable with private key management, they can simply delegate that function to their more tech-savvy kin, who would then assume the guardian role. This solves the problem of cost and complexity inherent in traditional self-custody methods that often require running a full node and using a hardware wallet. It also solves the problem of trusting third-party entities like centralized exchanges that often prioritize profits over security.  Thus, Fedimint provides an intermediate solution that uses pre-existing trust structures to create what Nwosu calls, “community custody.”  Read more: It's Genesis Block Day. Do You Know Where Your Bitcoin Keys Are?  “Billions of people are being excluded from accessing Bitcoin, due to exchange regulation. The reason exchanges need to be regulated is because if they're not, they're more likely to disappear with people’s money or get hacked. Then you have billions more being excluded from first-party custody due to cost and fear of complexity,” Nwosu said.  Community custody and hyperbitcoinization  Hyperbitcoinization refers to a scenario when bitcoin becomes the world’s default monetary system. According to Fediment’s team, self-custody is too costly and complex to accomplish that end. Similarly, third-party custody is too rigidly regulated to achieve mass adoption, especially in less developed countries. The only feasible solution is one that combines the security of self-custody with the simplicity of third-party platforms and eliminates cost, complexity and regulation.  Nwosi believes the mobile app Fedi is building will check all the boxes and bring the benefits of Fedimint to the masses. Fedi has even teamed up with global design company, Ideo, to ensure the final product incorporates human-centered design and is as simple and easy to use as possible.  “If you want to go to the moon, a bicycle won’t get you there. Neither will a car, or even a jumbo jet. You must re-architect and build a rocket,” Nwosi said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/19/fedi-to-build-privacy-focused-bitcoin-mobile-app-on-fedimint-protocol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b7bc21e2813a4f47167ba4e5417366e6299e038-6904x5178.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Past Performance of RUNE RUNE price trend had been contained within the resistance trendline, fueling the downtrend with the help of the 50-day SMA. However, the recent bullish reversal puts a stop to the bearish trend and breaches the resistance trendline, opposing SMA and the $2.50 mark. The buyers completed the mission by forming a bullish engulfing candle yesterday with a 22% jump. Source- Tradingview RUNE Technical Analysis RUNE price action shows the daily candle acting as the follow-through candle and preparing to reach the overhead resistance at $3. However, the higher price rejection suggests a delay in the uptrend. Hence, traders can expect the rally to slow down and lose some momentum over the week. The RSI indicator shows an increase in the underlying bullishness as the slope spikes higher into the nearly overbought zone. Furthermore, the MACD indicator shows the fast and slow lines maintaining a bullish trend but lacks spread. Nonetheless, the momentum indicators showcase an increase in buying pressure and promote the possibility of uptrend continuation above $2. In a nutshell, RUNE technical analysis maintains a bullish bias and signals a buying opportunity for traders. Upcoming Trend The bullish trend continuation will help the market value of RUNE increase by 25% if it reaches the $3.5 supply zone. First, however, it must surpass the psychological mark of $3. Conversely, the reversal from $3 will lead to a retest of the broken horizontal level at the $2.50 mark.

As of this writing, SOL is trading at $46.25, up 40% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko show, Tuesday. The market is anticipated to continue its ascent as long as $41 serves as support. Nevertheless, the bears may claw their way back if prices fail to surpass the $42 resistance barrier. Suggested Reading | Polygon Price Explodes By 60% – Is MATIC Nearing $1 Target? Solana Outperforms Major Cryptos Solana’s price behavior over the past seven days has outpaced Bitcoin, BNB, XRP, and Cardano despite not displaying as much upside as Ethereum during the same time period. If SOL keeps going up, its market capitalization might exceed Cardano’s $16.4 billion and overtake it as the eighth-largest digital asset by market cap. Tuesday saw the global cryptocurrency market capitalization surpass $1 trillion for the first time in as many months. Nonetheless, the total trading volume of cryptocurrencies decreased by more than 1 percent to $63 billion. The price of Solana experienced a robust bounce as investors continued to purchase dips. The token’s breakthrough of the $46 threshold represented its highest price since May of this year. Image - Changelly SOL Gets 70% More Light SOL has increased by more than 70 percent from its year-to-date low as the volume of its DeFi platforms has grown. Solana’s market capitalization of $15 billion makes it the ninth largest cryptocurrency in the market. Solana was able to overcome $44’s primary obstacle and convert it into support. Thus, SOL soared past the rising triangle, which is currently being tested as support. If this range is sustained over the medium term, the route to $59 will become less difficult. The price of SOL has climbed by around 20% during the previous 36 hours. It rose from a monthly low of $38.60 to a new monthly peak of $46.25. The quick increase has enabled the cryptocurrency to pass a significant area of resistance, which could lead to new highs.

It might be another earning call miss, given the destructive effects of the crypto winter and the CEO's doubling down on Bitcoin. MSTR fundamentally is not a highly profitable business with minimal revenue growth. With $2.3B of debt, MSTR may pledge or sell unencumbered Bitcoin, otherwise additional debt or share dilution would follow. Investors, get out while you can. Sell, sell, and sell. Investment Thesis MicroStrategy (MSTR) has long been linked to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), since its CEO took an aggressive position with the king of cryptocurrency in 2020. By FQ1'22, MSTR owned 129.2K Bitcoins with a total market value of $5.9B and YTD, 129.69K Bitcoins . Therefore, it is not a coincidence that MSTR's price chart looks awfully similar to BTC-USD's, especially given the recent notorious crypto winter that occurred recently. 5Y Correlation Between MSTR and BTC-USD's Prices Seeking Alpha Since the historical crypto winter in 2018 lasted for two years , we expect another cyclical behavior this time round as well. In addition, MSTR's stock decline is also partially attributed to its poorer financial performance in the past four consecutive quarters, significantly worsened by the macro issues, rising inflation, and potential recession. Therefore, we are not hopeful for stock price recovery in the short term and intermediate term. MSTR's Financial Performance Has Been Under-Whelming Thus Far S&P Capital IQ From the chart above, it is easy to see that MSTR has not performed well, with declining revenue and net income growth in the past few years. By the LTM, the company reported revenues of $507.1M and gross margins of 81.3%, representing minimal growth of 5.4% and 0.2 percentage points from FY2020 levels, respectively. In addition, MSTR reported massive net losses of -$556.2M and net income margins of -109.7% in the LTM, representing an enormous decline of 7416% and 102.2 percentage points from FY2020 levels, respectively. It is important to note that the losses are mainly attributed to the Bitcoin impairment charges recorded in the past seven quarters, with even more coming in FQ2'22 given the -58% decline in Bitcoin then. Painful indeed - since MSTR's stock price will continually be impacted moving forward if the price of Bitcoin does not recover. S&P Capital IQ Despite its minimal revenue growth, MSTR has been consistently increasing its operating expenses in the past few years. By the LTM, the company reported a total of $376.9M, representing an increase of 13.3% from FY2020 levels. Thereby, increasing the ratio to its revenues by 5.1 percentage points to 74.3% in the LTM. S&P Capital IQ Nonetheless, the bright point for MSTR is that it has been reporting positive Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") thus far, lending strength to its balance sheet for now. By the LTM, the company reported an FCF of $71.9M and an FCF margin of 14.2%, representing notable improvements of 43.8% and 3.8 percentage points from FY2020 levels, respectively. Thereby, improving its cash and equivalents to $98.9M on its balance sheet. S&P Capital IQ MSTR's Long-Term Debt Table S&P Capital IQ Based on the two tables above, it is evident that MSTR has taken on massive loans in the past two years, with a sum of $2.36B in long-term debts and $37.8M of interest expenses in the LTM. This is mostly attributed to the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic then and its continued investment in Bitcoin. In addition, its CEO continued to load up on Bitcoin in FQ2'22, while raising another $10M in capital for the purchase, therefore highlighting his unwavering conviction on the cryptocurrency. Nonetheless, given MSTR's FCF generation of $71.9M in the LTM, it is unlikely that the company would be able to repay the debt of $843.2M by 2025 through FCF alone, barring highly positive ( though unlikely ) earnings for the next two years. The company could potentially pledge some of its nearly $2B worth of unencumbered Bitcoins as collateral, or otherwise, sell some Bitcoins to raise capital. In the meantime, based on the original conversion features, we may also see an alternative share dilutive effect of 1.63M shares for the 2025 Convertible Notes. That would be equivalent to 15.6% of its existing diluted shares outstanding as of FQ1'22 - a somewhat significant sum given the company's continued stock-based compensation of $50.81M in the LTM. We shall see by 2025. Fortunately, MSTR practiced prudence in its net PPE assets to $100.3M and capital expenditures to $2.9M by the LTM, indicating a moderation of 29% since FY2019 levels. S&P Capital IQ Over the next three years, MSTR is expected to report revenue growth at a CAGR of 2.62%, while also potentially resuming net income profitability from FY2023 onwards. Its net income margins are also expected to improve from 7.1% in FY2019 to 8.8% in FY2024. For FY2022, consensus estimates that MSTR will report revenues of $506M and net incomes of -$112M, representing a YoY decline of 1% though improvement of 79%, respectively. In the meantime, analysts will be closely watching MSTR's FQ2'22 performance, with consensus revenue estimates of $123.32M and EPS of -$13.71, indicating YoY growth of -1.62% and 55.37%, respectively. Nonetheless, we are not overly hopeful about its performance, given the historical misses in the past four consecutive quarters. So, Is MSTR Stock A Buy , Sell, or Hold? MSTR 5Y EV/Revenue and P/E Valuations S&P Capital IQ MSTR is currently trading at an EV/NTM Revenue of 9.32x and NTM P/E of 112.98x, higher than its 5Y EV/Revenue mean of 5.75x though relatively in line with its 5Y P/E mean of 114.91x. The stock is also trading at $213.98, down 75.9% from its 52 weeks high of $891.38, though at a premium of 59.5% from its 52 weeks low of $134.09 MSTR 5Y Stock Price S&P Capital IQ Therefore, despite consensus estimates strong buy rating with a price target of $701.50, we are not convinced of its 227.83% upside. Even a future Bitcoin recovery would not justify MSTR's current premium stock valuation, because it fundamentally remains an underperforming company with limited ( projected ) net income and FCF profitability. As a result, we encourage investors to sell off their current holdings and move their capital elsewhere, especially since the time of maximum pain is not here yet, given the rising interest rates, inflation, and potential recession. We potentially see another drastic retracement for MSTR to $100s or less, since the crypto winter may not defrost by 2023 or 2024. Nonetheless, crypto and MSTR bulls may remain invested, if they are willing to gamble on Bitcoin's eventual recovery to $40K or more by sometime in 2023 or 2024. That would be a positive catalyst for its future stock recovery, returning some much-needed capital to the highly volatile investment. However, we are more skeptical since we mirror Dane Bowler's view on cryptocurrency in general, which you may read more about here: When Bitcoin Collapses It Doesn't Get Cheap . Therefore, we rate MSTR stock as a Sell and do not look back, anymore.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4524205-microstrategy-drastic-correction-imminent?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/110804.jpeg

Crypto custody firm Fireblocks is also involved in the bank's digital asset infrastructure, according to a press release on Wednesday,  Many large banks are edging towards crypto custody, but what makes this deal particularly significant is BNP Paribas Securities Services’ position as a major global custodian with almost $13 trillion in assets under custody.  BNP Paribas did not respond to requests for comment. Metaco declined to comment.  Metaco, which recently inked a custody tech deal with French bank Societe Generale (GLE), is becoming the go-to provider for banks and institutions looking to enter the crypto space. Metaco also recently announced a deal with Citigroup (C), and previously with the likes of BBVA (BBVA), Zodia Custody, DBS and UnionBank Philippines.  BNP Paribas Securities Services recently used Fireblocks, which also works on crypto assets with custody giant BNY Mellon, in a live experiment on the settlement and custody of a non-listed digital bond in the French market.  The service Metaco will be providing for SocGen and Citi is focused on security tokens, such as tokenized versions of stocks or other financial instruments, with less of an emphasis on pure cryptocurrencies.  This is a popular trend among French banks as they enter the digital asset space, explained Metaco CEO Adrien Treccani in a previous interview with CoinDesk.

42422689,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0otTh,1658240866,Bored Apes Creator Warns of Threat Group Targeting NFT Communities,"Yuga Labs, the development studio behind popular non-fungible tokens (NFT) collections such as the Bored Apes Yacht Club, warned in a tweet Monday of a group of attackers targeting the NFT community.  “Our security team has been tracking a persistent threat group that targets the NFT community,” Yuga developers tweeted. “We believe that they may soon be launching a coordinated attack targeting multiple communities via compromised social media accounts.”  Yuga Labs did not respond to requests asking for more specific information at writing time. However, the warning came as millions of dollars worth of NFT exploits have occurred in the past few months.  The past weekend saw over $375,000 worth of ether (ETH) and 314 NFTs stolen from Premint NFT, a popular NFT platform. An investigation by security firm CertiK revealed the threat actors planted a malicious JavaScript code on the premint.xyz website. The script was designed to instruct users to “set approvals for all” when connecting their wallets to the site, which allowed attackers to access all assets in the user’s wallets.  “While the malicious file is no longer available due to the Domain Name Server no longer existing, the effects of the attack are visible on-chain,"" read a statement from CertiK at the time. ""In total, six externally owned accounts (EOA) are directly associated with the attack, with approximately 275 ETH stolen (~$375K).  The firm added that attackers “exploit the centralization issues and single-points of failure” that come with crypto projects relying on centralized internet infrastructures. “Hacks of this kind are becoming increasingly popular,” CertiK said. “There has been a marked increase in attackers targeting other official accounts such as social media platforms to conduct exploits.”  The Premint attack came nearly a week after attackers stole over $1.4 million worth of ether from Omni Protocol, an NFT platform that allows users to take loans against their NFTs.  That followed a May attack when users of NFT marketplace OpenSea received false promotional messages on the project’s Discord channel, which led community members to a fake site that ultimately drained user wallets after clicking on a malicious link.  In April, the Bored Apes’ Instagram account and Discord server were exploited with an unofficial ""mint"" link sent out to followers. The fraudulent link claimed that users could mint ""land"" in the then-upcoming OthersideMeta, as previously reported.  In a separate April incident, attackers exploited a now-fixed design flaw in the Rarible NFT marketplace to steal a Bored Ape NFT from Taiwanese singer and actor Jay Chou and sell it for over $500,000.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/19/bored-apes-creator-warns-of-threat-group-targeting-nft-communities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/740b6910565a017a314b369b4422c8d71ba50c20-960x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That implies a roughly 625% jump from the token's November peak of $68.9K despite ongoing financial contagion effects in the crypto market resulting in widespread price depreciation and wealth destruction. The world's largest digital token by market cap is ""tailor-made to being an anti-inflation store of value,"" he said during the 2022 Bloomberg Crypto Summit, adding that ""it is easily transferable and so it's better than gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) in so many ways."" Novogratz, a former global macro investor, pointed out that the debt-driven global economy is fueling high consumer price inflation, and bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) may serve as a unique way to store wealth over the long-term. In contradiction to Novogratz's remarks about bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) being an inflation hedge, CPI has been soaring to its highest since 1981 over the past year, though bitcoin has been slumping well over 60% from its peak in November, suggesting that the crypto doesn't necessarily protect wealth during inflationary cycles.

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: Bitcoin has managed to hold $22,000 as the European Central Bank has flagged it would raise rates by 25 basis points on Thursday. ETH continues to rally, up 5% on the day.  Market Moves: Omkar Godbole looks at staked eth's expansion to layer 2 and how it could mean lower fees and more yield-generating opportunities for investors staking ether.  This web version of today's First Mover newsletter was produced by Sage D. Young.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading up slightly on the day, as eurozone bond yields shot up after reports that the European Central Bank will discuss whether to raise rates by 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) or 50 basis points at its meeting on Thursday.  BTC is up 15% over the last seven days, and Monday was the cryptocurrency’s best day in over a month.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at around $1,550 at the time of writing, a 5% increase on the day. The token of Ethereum Classic, the legacy chain that split from the Ethereum blockchain following a hard fork, is up 10% on the day, trading at about $25.  That comes as the Merge is a topic of conversation among traders and as the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) kicked off Tuesday morning in Paris. There will be more than 250 speakers at the event with a speech from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin on Thursday.  Ether's options market flipped bullish on Monday, showing a bias for strength in Ethereum's native token for the first time in over six months.  Other altcoins continued to rise on Tuesday, with NEAR up 12%, SOL by 9.5% and UNI by 5.7%.  In other news, crypto broker Genesis Global Trading has filed a $1.2 billion claim against the now insolvent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, according to a 1,157-page court filing uploaded by bankruptcy trustee Teneo.  Meanwhile, crypto lender Celsius Network laid out its mining-focused reorganization plan at its first bankruptcy hearing Monday.

On Monday, Ethereum-based liquid staking giant Lido Finance announced plans to offer staked ether (stETH) – a derivative representing an equivalent amount of ether deposited into the protocol – on layer 2 products, which process transactions relatively faster and at cheaper costs than the Ethereum mainnet.  ""For Ethereum stakers, this means staking with lower fees and access to a new suite of DeFi (decentralized finance) applications to amplify yields,"" Lido said in an explainer blog published Monday. Lido's stETH is heavily integrated into DeFi. Ethereum's high transaction costs have kept retail investors from accessing DeFi, and so the launch of liquid staking tools on the relatively cheaper layer 2s could boost mainstream adoption of DeFi.  Layer 2 protocols run a separate blockchain on top of the main network, providing a secondary framework where transactions can take place. Once the transactions are processed, the data is sent back to the layer 1 network where it is stored in the blockchain ledger. That way, layer 2s help alleviate network congestion on the main network.  Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Loopring are some of the well-known Ethereum layer 2 tools that facilitate higher transaction throughput (expressed as a number of transactions per second) at lower prices to broaden participation, all the while retaining the security of the layer 1 blockchain.  While Lido didn't announce a timeline for its layer 2 expansion, it did express commitment to offering liquid derivatives of staked tokens on various layer 2s with ""demonstrated network activity,"" starting with Arbitrum and Optimism.  Lido said it has already integrated with Ethereum smart wallet Argent to make wstETH, the wrapped version of the staked ether token, available on Ethereum-focused scaling platform zkSync. Earlier this year, the Aztec protocol unveiled its layer 2 tool on zkSync.  At press time, Lido controlled 90% of the $6.9 billion ether liquid staking market, according to Dune Analytics.  Lido users can stake their ether in return for stETH, which can be used on decentralized lending and borrowing platforms to generate an additional yield. Lido users can also avoid the burden of owning a minimum of 32 ETH to participate in staking – a process of holding coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the network's operations in return for newly minted coins. Lido users can redeem stETH for ETH only after the completion of Ethereum's transition from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.  Lido is confident that a large portion of economic activity will migrate to layer 2 networks in the future. The company plans to support wstETH bridging and staking in the early days of L2 expansion, eventually allowing ""staking of ETH held by users on L2 networks directly from that L2 without the need to bridge their assets back to Ethereum Mainnet.""  stETH is supposed to trade close to the spot price of ether. However, the staked derivative slipped to a discount of 0.93 to ETH following the collapse of Terra's algorithmic stablecoin UST in May.  The situation has improved somewhat, with the Ethereum developers recently announcing Sept. 19 as the tentative timeline for the long-awaited transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism. The stETH discount to ether has narrowed to 0.98 since the announcement on Thursday. While ether has rallied by more than 30%, Lido's governance token, LDO, has surged by 58%, according to data provided by CoinDesk.

Bringing The Concept of Second-Party Custody Fedi app will be officially launched in Q1 2023. It will provide a user interface for Fedimint, an open-source protocol that leverages federated Chaumian Ecash mints to decentralize bitcoin custody and enhance the scaling capabilities of the currency. The open-source protocol is based on the concept of second-party custody, which improves upon third-party custody solutions including self-custody or first-party custody setups. Second-party custody relies on parties that are already trustable in real life. For example, close friends or family members can secure their funds instead of completely outsourcing this to an unknown institutional party. Commenting on the development, Fedi co-founder and CEO, Obi Nwosu, in a statement: “Fedi and Fedimint will help put monetary power back into the hands of everyone, everywhere. This creates brighter futures for billions and especially for those struggling under oppressive regimes, which ultimately makes the world a better place.” Fedimint brings that trust assumption into a second-party trust model that is less technically complex than self-custody and more scalable and private. In a nutshell, Fedimint leverages a decentralized trust system to enable Bitcoin users to form communities with friends and family, within which transactions are cheaper, quicker, and anonymous.

42422687,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0otXh,1658236730,Investment Firm Valkyrie Branches Into Venture Capital With Focus on Israeli Crypto Startups,"Crypto investment firm Valkyrie is moving into venture capital with a planned $30 million fund that will bet heavily on early-stage startups in Israel.  Valkyrie has hired Lluis Pedragosa, a veteran of Israel’s VC scene and former partner of cybersecurity-oriented Israeli VC Team8, to lead Valkyrie Ventures.  The Spaniard told CoinDesk that the crypto startup market in Israel has been languishing in a “vacuum” and that despite the country’s surging tech entrepreneur landscape, funders, founders and builders were all avoiding crypto. He attributed that to the bad taste left by the initial coin offerings scams of 2017 and 2018.  “But that has changed in the past 12 to 18 months, with more and more entrepreneurs jumping on the blockchain wagon,” Pedragosa said.  Valkyrie will invest $250,000 to $1 million in behind-the-scenes infrastructure companies that make crypto businesses run smoothly, he said, pointing to security and authentication, data management, networking and storage firms – “all of the technological rails that decentralized applications will need in order to be built.”  Pedragosa said Valkyrie has already invested in a Web3 team called “Bunches” that’s building a messaging platform for wallets. A team member for Bunches didn't respond to a request for comment.  Pedragosa said Valkyrie will provide Israeli teams with access to the U.S. market. Valkyrie is a Tennessee-based company with a largely U.S.-based network of contacts and customers that will help “bridge the gap” for Israeli teams.  Pedragosa said Valkyrie is looking for companies with mass-market potential with projects that help crypto ventures scale into the billions of users. That was his thesis when he embarked on the VC effort with Valkyrie and “the thesis is the same” today, he said.  One thing that has changed are the valuations of the companies promising to build that on-chain future. Startup valuations have been slashed amid the macroeconomic uncertainty and compounded by the crypto rout. Israel’s own startup market didn't escape the pain.  “We believe it's an even better time to start a fund because innovation is generally more prominent in times of crisis,” Pedragosa said. Plus, lower valuations mean better deals, he said.

Let’s examine the technicals. MATIC has sustained its steady solid momentum and is trading higher, sending signals of a bullish run.

During this run, the altcoin has recently surpassed $0.745 after breaking through many resistance levels. How far can this token maintain this pace?

The company’s CEO, Wilson Wei, called it “LinkedIn for Web3.”  “CyberConnect’s mission is to connect everyone on Web3,” Wei told CoinDesk in an email. “We found that a trusted identity network is the foundation for building more meaningful connections.”  The product also seeks to protect users from social media-related fraud.

The official blog article states that in addition to helping creators with all post-mint and secondary sales, OpenSea will advise them on handling all pre-mint activities and allowlist minting for their community and fans. The objective of enabling users to have custody of their NFTs is to create “the best Solana experience” inside the NFT ecosystem. “We’re excited to start this program with two Solana creators as part of our launchpad experience. We are excited to launch and learn with these first drops, and we’re committed to expanding primary drops on OpenSea.” OpenSea Supports Solana Three months after OpenSea turned on support for Solana, the development happened.

42422701,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0otrh,1658233834,"THORChain Phases Out Support for Rune Tokens on Ethereum, BNB Chain","THORChain has activated a “killswitch” that will eventually phase out rune (RUNE) based on the Ethereum blockchain and BNB Chain in favor of rune issued on its native blockchain.  “The BEP-2 and ERC-20 $RUNE killswitch will be activated at block 6500000. Upgrades will no longer be 1:1,” developers said in a tweet Monday. BEP-2 and ERC20 refer to tokens issued atop the BNB Chain and Ethereum networks, respectively.  The killswitch will reduce the redemption rate of the BNB Chain-based rune (BNB.RUNE) and Ethereum-based rune (ETH.RUNE) from 1:1 to 1:0 over the next year.  That means 1 BNB.RUNE presented after six months of the killswitch will be redeemed only for 0.5 THOR.RUNE, and after one year, it will be redeemed for 0.0 THOR.RUNE, which means the token is effectively entirely deprecated.  RUNE was, so far, issued on the BNB Chain and Ethereum networks as an IOU, meaning the tokens were redeemable for an equivalent value of THORChain-based assets. Users acquired the tokens 18 months before the launch of its multichain testing network, “Chaosnet.”  Anyone could have acquired enough RUNE to run a ""THORNode,"" which processes transactions on and validates the THORChain network.  Developers, however, explained earlier this year that BNB.RUNE and ETH.RUNE, the two IOU tokens, allowed third parties to create new tokens using THORChain’s “mint” function, which made THORChain dependent on the two networks.  “Six months ago, a white hat found a critical vulnerability, that was *almost* exploited but swiftly prevented, around this mint functionality on Binance Chain,” developers pointed out at the time. “ETH.RUNE also has unfavorable characteristics for long-term holders, being the transferTo() function, which makes it easy for users to be phished.”  Moving the tokens to THORChain’s native network makes the network less susceptible to exploits, the developers said.  Meanwhile, THORChain developers said in Monday’s tweet that several large exchanges that have listed BNB.RUNE haven't made the switch to THORChain-issued rune yet.  “This has created two separate markets for RUNE and one that is both unnecessary, and problematic, since it slows adoption of the network,” they said. “These exchanges have not yet been given an imperative to switch to native RUNE.  THORChain allows users to trade bitcoin (BTC) for any other supported asset without the use of bridges or wrapped assets. Bridges are software that allows users to transfer coins among different blockchains.

105063,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496090,1658232045,"Bitcoin Transaction Cost Plummets After Every 4 Years, Is there A Reason?","Bitcoin emerged in 2009, making it a total of 13 years of operations. In all these years, experts have identified interesting patterns from watching its movement closely. Observers suggest that two factors usually evoke these patterns on the network, market conditions and investor sentiment. A change in either of these factors causes many events to unfold in the ecosystem. The recent observation by these experts points towards a transaction cost reduction every four years. For example, the cost for one Bitcoin transaction was reduced to $56.846 on Thursday, July 14. This reduction indicates a four-year cycle of cost reduction on the network. Related Reading | TA: Ethereum Outpaces Bitcoin, Why ETH Could Rise To $1,500 Initially, the cost of BTC transactions was usually unpredictable because it is derived using the number of transactions to divide the miner’s revenue. But now, the recent Blockchain.com data seem to have proven a more satisfying pattern for crypto enthusiasts. Bitcoin Data Shows A Predictive Pattern According to available data on cost movement, July 2022 saw a drop in transaction cost by more than 81%. This percentage was derived using May 2021 high transaction costs of $300.331. The factors leading to such a spike in transaction costs was the reduction in on-chain transaction and a prolonged bear market. Then, many crypto investors struggled to operate amid regulatory challenges permeating the industry. But now, it is clear that the upward and downward trend in transactions occurs every four years. Data revealed that this pattern first emerged in 2014, then the next one occurred in 2018, and now another one in 2022, showing a 4-year cycle. Based on these data, experts predict that by 2026, another cycle will occur and might cause a fall to $50. On the flip side, miners are losing revenue, which has worsened since 2022. According to reports, July 2022 has been the worst miners have seen in 2 years. Market Crash Affects Miner’s Revenue It’s not surprising that miners recorded a loss in revenue in July 2022. The crypto market hasn’t performed very well since the announcement of a rate increase, activation of the rise, and the crash of the Terra network. Related Reading | Liquidations Cross $230 Million As Ethereum Barrels Past $1,400 These events have contributed terribly to the falling market prices. As a result, miners now spend more on operating costs in Bitcoin mining. Thankfully, the market saw a fall in GPU prices, providing a ray of hope for miners. By that, miners can get hardware at affordable prices, reducing operational costs. The price at which miners buy their hardware fell by 15%. This is because many card manufacturers started operations again after closing shop for some time due to a chip shortage. Now, the supply of these graphic cards is higher than its demands causing many cards to sell below MSRPs to fight cut-throat.

According to a securities and intelligence agency alert released on July 18, hackers have developed apps using the same logos and other identifying details as real cryptocurrency organizations to scam investors. 244 people had already been duped by these fraudulent apps, according to the FBI. Cyber-Criminals Using Legitimate Logos For Fake Crypto App Cybercriminals used the logo of a legitimate U.S. financial institution, in one instance, to lure victims into downloading an app. They then encouraged them to deposit cryptocurrencies into wallets connected to their accounts. Victims would be required to pay taxes on any withdrawals they sought to make using the app. The withdrawals would still be inaccessible even if the victims paid the fees. Therefore this was merely another scheme to steal more money from the victims. The FBI reported that 28 victims were scammed for over $3.7 million between December 2021 and May 2022. Cybersecurity Firm ESET Uncovered “Sophisticated Scheme” Cybersecurity company ESET discovered a “sophisticated scheme” earlier this year that involved disseminating Trojan programs posing as well-known cryptocurrency wallets. Then, these applications would try to steal cryptocurrency from their targets. One user lost $600,000 in Bitcoin last year due to a fraudulent cryptocurrency program posing as a mobile Trezor app on Apple’s App Store. According to a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report released in June 2022, since 2021, scammers have stolen up to $1 billion in cryptocurrency, with roughly half of all crypto-related scams coming from social media platforms.

Key Technical Points: The SAND prices jumped by 7.26% in the last 24 hours. However, the bullish trend struggles to surpass the $1.45 resistance level. The 24-hour trading volume of Sandbox is $1.018 Billion, indicating a rise of 177%. Past Performance of SAND During the early-June sell-off, the SAND holder lost the $1.27 support and plunged to a new 2022 low mark of $0.737. However, the coin price showcased a sharp recovery from this level and attempted to breach the flipped resistance of $1.27. Since last month, the coin chart showed several failed attempts to break this resistance, eventually revealing an ascending triangle pattern. Source – Tradingview SAND Technical Analysis The higher low formation within this pattern reflected a gradual growth in bullish momentum, indicating the buyers are wrestling for trend control. As a result, on July 18th, the buyers gave a massive breakout from the $1.27 neckline, supported by a significant pump in volume. Today, the SAND price is 0.21% down, and the long-wick rejection attached to the daily candle may encourage a $1.27 retest. The increased buying pressure last night influenced the MACD and signal lines to gain a bullish spread and drive the RSI slope to approach the overbought boundary. Hence the momentum indicators maintain a bullish bias, opposing the price action. The market price sustains above the 50-day SMA (red) in the daily chart but struggles to exceed the 100-day SMA. In a nutshell, SAND technical analysis suggests the traders wait for the price action confirmation. Upcoming Trend If the expected retest sustains above the $1.27 support, the buyers will acquire a stable footing to carry this recovery forward. The triangle pattern breakout should lead the coin price to the $1.8 mark per the technical setup. Conversely, if buyers fail to sustain this breakout, the SAND price may witness a significant correction, possibly to the $1 psychological mark.

Instead, the crypto that seemed promising from inception started plummeting when the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued it. The accusation was that the company raised more than $1.3 billion illegitimately. As a result, SEC held the co-founder Christian Larsen and Bradley Garlinghouse, the CEO, accountable for the illegal gains. The court case has already lasted for more than one year. But, surprisingly, on April 14, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that the fight had gone very well. Moreover, his statements and results seem to have yielded favorable fruits for the crypto.

The Ripple CTO jokingly told sources that he wouldn’t be selling his XRP coins. Instead, he will hold them awaiting when the coins spikes in price. According to him, if 1 XRP sells at $589, he will become a rich man. Another news revealed that the CTO had earlier sold more than half of his remaining 5 million XRP. But after a few days, he bought another 2.8 million coins to top it. McCaleb mentioned that his decision to add up to the coin was sudden. However, he disclosed that his mind wouldn’t rest until he replaced the coins. In his statement, there’s a possibility that his remaining XRP coins will provide the security he needs for his family in the future. Ripple And SEC Court Issues Continue Amid all these, the battle between SEC and Ripple is still ongoing.

Instead, Judge Sarah Netburn refused the claims and mandated that every document must be disclosed.

Source – Tradingview CRV Technical Analysis CRV price action shows the daily candle dumping the market value by 5.42%, teasing a tweezer top formation. Hence traders might find a retracement to the psychological mark of $1 as a retest due to increased selling pressure. However, a bullish reversal exceeding the 100-day SMA will result in a price jump to the $2 mark. The underlying bullishness shows a gradual growth as the RSI slope continues to grow with the support of the 14-day SMA. However, bearish divergence grows between the price jump and RSI jump, teasing a downfall. However, the MACD indicator shows the fast and slow lines avoiding a downfall as the lines regain the bullish alignment. Hence, the technical indicators represent an increase in selling pressure. In a nutshell, CRV technical analysis signals a high bearish retracement from the 100-day SMA as the selling pressure grows. Upcoming Trend The bullish break out of the opposing SMA will surpass the $1.50 level to reach the psychological mark of $2. Conversely, the retracement to the $1 seems inevitable as the selling pressure grows.

The business believes this move will improve stETH’s market capitalization and usage while decreasing investor gas costs. Scaling staked ether (stETH) to layer-2 Ethereum protocols is what staking protocol Lido Finance is doing as the price of ether rises in preparation for its long-awaited “Merge” to Proof-of-Stake validation. What does this mean? Lower gas fees + expanded DeFi ecosystem⚡️ Lido on L2 is not limited to a single network, but will unfold via an ongoing roadmap of L2 scaling solutions. The supported Lido On L2 networks will be announced soon. — Lido (@LidoFinance) July 18, 2022 Beacon Chain For Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Investors in Lido stETH earn staking incentives when they lock ether on the Beacon Chain for Proof-of-Stake. Although the Beacon Chain Merging for ETH has been planned since 2020, Ethereum developers chose September 19 as their newest merge target last week. Holders of stETH will still have to wait six to twelve months to unlock tokens after The Merge. On integrated DeFi protocols like Curve, stowed ether can be traded. Rebasable Tokens However, layer-2s that do not enable “rebasable” tokens that alter the value in response to staking incentives are currently incompatible with stETH. As stated by Lido, wstETH delivers stETH a set value, enabling the wrapped token to be traded on well-known layer-2s like UniSwap, ArcX, 1inch, and SushiSwap. The stETH Curve liquidity pool nearly ran out of ether a month prior, making it challenging for investors to liquidate positions. The lack of liquidity led to stETH’s price losing its historical parity with ether and falling to a low of 0.93 ETH. According to CoinMarketCap, one stETH is currently trading for 0.98 ETH. In the previous week, LDO, Lido’s DAO token, increased by more than 130%.

The agreement was made between Moonbeam Foundation and Three Arrows on Sept. 20, 2021. Three Arrows, also known as 3AC, borrowed the open term loan at a 12% interest rate.  Separately, 3AC was additionally engaged by Moonbeam as a “liquidity consultant” for the network’s moonriver (MOVR) and glimmer (GLMR) tokens. Moonbeam is a smart contract network based on Polkadot that allows for interoperability between the Polkadot and Ethereum networks.  Three Arrows held over 10 million GLMR tokens and 200,000 MOVR tokens. These have not been returned to Moonbeam as of July 15. These are valued at nearly $10 million at current market rates.  Under the terms of the liquidity consultancy, 3AC was tasked by Moonbeam to make ""commercially reasonable efforts to open up new markets"" for the two tokens, with the hedge fund also conducting ""market analysis"" and suggesting new ""suitable exchanges"" for the tokens to trade on.  However, Three Arrows was not liable to “the ultimate performance” and had no specific trading volume targets. The obligations were “limited to making commercially reasonable efforts to advise on methods to increase liquidity” for river and glimmer tokens.  Meanwhile, the documents show that Moonbeam paid Three Arrows a sum of $90,000 as a six-month fee in installments for the consultancy services.  3AC has been an active investor in the digital asset industry in recent years, with investments across non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance, layer 1 blockchain firms and crypto companies.  The hedge fund, however, suffered massive losses following the Terra system’s implosion of its LUNA currency in mid-May and a market-wide decline in June, leading to its insolvency.

42422704,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0otzh,1658225716,"Lido Finance Will Soon Offer Staked Ether on Layer 2 Networks, Proposes to Sell LDO for DAI","Liquid staking, which allows users to stake cryptocurrencies while retaining a tradeable variant of the locked coins, will soon become accessible to investors wary of Ethereum's high transaction costs.  On Monday, Ethereum-based liquid staking giant Lido Finance announced plans to offer staked ether (stETH) – a derivative representing an equivalent amount of ether (ETH) deposited into the protocol – on layer 2 systems, which process transactions relatively faster and at cheaper costs than the Ethereum mainnet.  ""For Ethereum stakers, this means staking with lower fees and access to a new suite of DeFi applications to amplify yields,"" Lido said in an explainer blog published Monday. Lido's stETH is heavily integrated into decentralized finance. Ethereum's high transaction costs have kept retail investors from accessing decentralized finance (DeFi), therefore, the launch of liquid staking solutions on the relatively cheaper layer 2s could boost mainstream adoption of DeFi.  Layer 2 protocols run a separate blockchain on top of the mainnet, providing a secondary framework where transactions can take place. Once the transactions are processed, the data is sent back to the layer 1 blockchain, where it is stored in the blockchain ledger. That way layer 2s help alleviate network congestion on the mainnet.  Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum and Loopring are some of the well-known Ethereum layer 2 solutions, facilitating higher transaction throughput (expressed as a number of transactions per second) at lower prices to broaden participation, all the while retaining the security of the layer 1.  While Lido did not announce a timeline for its layer 2 expansion, it did express commitment to offering liquid derivatives of staked tokens on various layer 2s with ""demonstrated network activity,"" starting with Arbitrum and Optimism.  Lido said it has already integrated with Ethereum smart wallet Argent to make wstETH, the wrapped version of the staked ether token, available on Ethereum-focused scaling product zkSync. Earlier this year, Aztec protocol unveiled its layer 2 system on zkSync.  At press time, Lido controlled 90% of the $6.9 billion ether liquid staking market, according to Dune Analytics.  Lido users can stake their ether in return for stETH, which can be used in decentralized lending and borrowing protocols to generate an additional yield. Lido users can also avoid the burden of owning a minimum of 32 ETH to participate in staking – a process of holding coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the network's operations in return for newly minted coins. Lido users can redeem stETH for ETH only after the completion of Ethereum's transition from the proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.  Lido is confident that a large portion of economic activity will migrate to layer 2 networks in the future. The company plans to support wstETH bridging and staking in the early days of layer 2 expansion, eventually allowing ""staking of ETH held by users on [layer 2] networks directly from that [system] without the need to bridge their assets back to Ethereum mainnet.""  Staked ether is supposed to trade close to the spot price of ether. However, the staked derivative slipped to a discount of 0.93 to ETH following the collapse of Terra's algorithmic stablecoin UST in May.  The situation has improved somewhat, with the Ethereum developers recently announcing Sept. 19 as the tentative timeline for the long-awaited transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism. The stETH discount to ether has narrowed to 0.98 since the announcement on Thursday. While ether has rallied by more than 30%, Lido's governance token LDO has surged by 58%, according to data provided by CoinDesk.  Lido proposes selling 2% of the LDO token supply  On Tuesday, Lido Finance also introduced a community proposal to liquidate 20 million of its LDO tokens, amounting to 2% of the total supply of 1 billion, in return for stablecoin DAI.  The 20 million LDO will be sold from the Lido decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) treasury, which administers stETH, at a per token price of $1.45215. The price was calculated by adding a 50% premium to the seven-day time weighted average price (TWAP).  ""This proposal is looking to secure ~2 years of operating runway for Lido DAO, in stablecoins,"" Lido said. ""This will ensure Lido and its core contributors are able to continue the important work needed for the protocol in the long term and to flourish as an autonomous, self-governing collective.""  Details of the proposal reveal a plan to sell 10 million tokens to the crypto investment firm Dragonfly Capital, which had around $3 billion in assets under management as of April. The remaining coins will be distributed to the DAO-approved group of other strategic participants.  Lido expects Dragonfly's participation to facilitate vertical integration of staked derivatives in the decentralized finance ecosystem and strengthen Lido's grip over the liquid staking market.",POSITIVE,ETH | DAI | LDO,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | DAI | LDO,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/19/lido-finance-will-soon-offer-staked-ether-on-layer-2-networks-proposes-to-sell-ldo-for-dai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ad6ef7680ebfe4d6943c72d9828d75d4a5514bb-1707x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Court Documents Indicate a Connection,"Tai Ping Shan (TPS) Capital created a complicated corporate structure that obscured its relationship with Three Arrows Capital, and later denied any connection aside from “passive investment,” claiming it was independent. But court filings prepared by Three Arrows’ liquidators show the two are tightly connected.  In a statement, TPS said that, “TPS has its own independent operations and was acting as an agent with respect to the loans between lenders and 3AC.” However, court documents show it was actually Three Arrows acting as a guarantor for TPS for loans on which it later defaulted, according to demand letters referenced in court filings.  The revelation adds new details to the tangled web surrounding the former Singapore hedge fund, which couldn’t sustain the pressure of a rapidly onsetting bear market and the collapse of Luna.  According to one demand letter found in court filings, TPS Capital took out a USDC 20 million loan from Arrakis Capital in late April and defaulted on it in mid-June as TPS was unable to honor a margin call for its trading account, contribute additional capital, or begin repayment of the loan.  A similar structure listing Three Arrows as a guarantor for a TPS Capital loan was found in a demand letter issued by Mirana Corp., a Seychelles-registered crypto fund, for a loan made in early June.  Term sheets for the loans were not included in the filed court documents.  According to the document, the loan required TPS Capital to contribute additional capital should the price of bitcoin decline by more than 10% since the origination of the loan. In addition, by June 14 the price of bitcoin breached the margin call level of $23,510, yet TPS did not respond to the lender’s attempts to contact it.  Mirana then sued Three Arrows in Singapore, but filings at the time did not mention TPS Capital.  As TPS Capital received demand letters from its creditors, court documents, citing on-chain data, show that Three Arrows transferred $31 million in crypto to a wallet controlled by TPS Capital.  While the amount is similar to that owed by TPS Capital to creditors, it's not known if that was the intent of the fund transfer.  The court filing also notes that Three Arrows transferred USDT 10.9 million to an otherwise unknown address, which then transferred it to a second unknown address.  In the case of Mirana’s loan to Three Arrows, all correspondence was directed to Three Arrows co-founder Kyle Davies. For Arrakis’ loan, it was directed to Ningxin Zhan, who is listed as an authorized agent for TPS and an operations contact at Three Arrows.  Three Arrows’ Founders at the Top of Org Charts  Despite claims of being passive investors, Three Arrows’ founder Su Zhu, and Kelly Kaili Chen, spouse of Kyle Davies, own over 80% of TPS’ BVI entity, which in turn owns 47.5% of the Singapore parent.  This wasn’t previously known, because BVI law directors and shareholders of a company in the territory aren’t publicly disclosed.  Another firm called “Three Lucky Charms Ltd” owns an equal amount of shares, but this company isn’t mentioned in the court filing.  Caymans-registered Tai Ping Shan, which owns 5% of the Singapore entity TPS Capital, lists Paul Muspratt, the managing director of West Bay Global Services, a corporate services provider, as one of its directors, alongside Steven Sokohl, another West Bay employee, and Yi Long Fung as directors.  Muspratt, Sokohl, and Fung are also listed as directors of ThreeAC Ltd, the managing fund of all of Three Arrows’ entities.  Aside from the role as director with ThreeAC Ltd, Fung isn’t mentioned again in the court document. According to a directory of Canadian federally incorporated businesses, he is listed as a director of TPS Capital’s Canadian-registered entity, which operates by the same name and was founded in February 2022.  Three Arrows is due back in court in Singapore on July 26 for a pre-trial conference regarding the Mirana lawsuit. Meanwhile, in the United States, the case continues before U.S. courts in New York on July 28. Neither Three Arrows nor TPS Capital has declared bankruptcy in Singapore as of the evening of July 19 Asia time, according to the Singapore Insolvency Office.  In response to a request for comment from CoinDesk, a TPS spokesperson pointed to a prior statement the company made claiming that is independent from Three Arrows.

Key Technical Points: The GALA prices jumped by 8.82% in the last 24 hours. The bull cycle prepares to exit the falling channel and beat the 50-day SMA. The 24-hour trading volume of GalaGames is $495 Million, indicating a rise of 119%. Past Performance of GALA GALA price chart shows a long-coming downtrend within a falling channel pattern accounting for a price drop of 55% within the last two months. The downfall breaks the $0.050 psychological mark, but the recent bullish reversal has the prices challenging the resistance trendline. Additionally, the bull cycle repairs to beat the 50-day SMA slightly below the supply zone at $0.065. Source – Tradingview GALA Technical Analysis GALA price action shows a 13% jump in the last two days, but the higher price rejection in the daily candle from the 50-day SMA shows a bearish reaction. However, the increased trading volume supports the bullish breakout theory. Hence traders should wait for the price action confirmation before taking a bullish trade. The underlying bullish momentum increase is evident from the RSI slope crossing the halfway line. As a result, the technical indicator projects a high possibility of a falling channel breakout. The MACD indicator shows the fast and slow lines avoiding a downfall as the lines regain the bullish alignment. Hence the technical indicators represent a bullish bias teasing a jump above $0.065. In a nutshell, GALA technical analysis signals a high possibility of an uptrend continuation with a falling channel breakout. Upcoming Trend The falling breakout can propel the GALA prices to exceed the $0.065 supply zone to reach the psychological mark of $0.10. Conversely, the bullish failure to beat the resistance trend will retest the $0.045 support level.

The 24-hour trading volume of Decentraland is $398 Million, indicating a rise of 143%. Past Performance of MANA MANA price chart shows the market value surpassing the resistance trendline and the 50-day SMA displaying a breakout entry opportunity. The trendline had kept the prices under a downtrend for months accounting for a dip to $0.76. Moreover, the recovering market conditions increase the demand for altcoins, evidenced by the increased trading volumes. Source – Tradingview MANA Technical Analysis The trendline breakout ends the two-month-long correction phase in MANA prices. This increases the likelihood of a price jump to the 100-day SMA at $1.20. Hence, traders can expect the rally to exceed the psychological mark of $1. The increased buying pressure influences the MACD and signal lines to regain the positive alignment and propels the RSI slope into the nearly overbought zone. Hence, the momentum indicators forecast a potential uptrend continuation. Additionally, the market price sustains above the 50-day SMA (red) in the daily chart teasing an upside rally from the resistance trendline. In a nutshell, MANA technical analysis signals a high likelihood of a breakout rally exceeding the psychological mark of $1. Upcoming Trend The resistance level for the upcoming positive trend for MANA prices is at the psychological mark of $1, the 100-day SMA at $1.20, and $1.50.

Yuga Labs Warns of a Potential Coordinated Attack In a Twitter update posted today, Yuga Labs noted that its security team has been tracking a “persistent threat group” targeting the NFT community through compromised social media accounts. Our security team has been tracking a persistent threat group that targets the NFT community. We believe that they may soon be launching a coordinated attack targeting multiple communities via compromised social media accounts. Please be vigilant and stay safe. — Yuga Labs (@yugalabs) July 18, 2022 This is not the first time the company has warned of a potential attack. In June, Gordon Goner, pseudonymous co-founder of Yuga Labs, issued a warning of a possible incoming attack on its Twitter social media accounts. Soon after the warning, Twitter officials began monitoring activity on the accounts and fortified their existing security. Goner told investors that the company would never conduct surprise mints, a popular method attackers use to lure victims. In the past, the company has also suffered hacks through its other social platforms, such as Discord channels. We’ve been in contact with Twitter and they confirmed that they have an active monitor on the accounts and security has been escalated. We’re feeling more secure, but please stay safe everyone. And remember there will be no surprise mints. — GordonGoner.eth (@GordonGoner) June 12, 2022 Yuga Labs’ recent warning comes just a day after the attack of a popular NFT platform Premint NFT which led to the drain out of approximately 314 NFTs and $375,000 in Ethereum (ETH), making it one of the largest NFT hacks of this year. The thefts occurred on Sunday after hackers inserted malicious code into Premint’s website. We're continuing to dig into this incident, but a reminder: ❌ You will never, EVER be asked to approve ANY KIND OF transaction on PREMINT. ✍️ When connecting a wallet, you'll be asked to *sign* a message, but there will NEVER be a gas fee or anything resembling a transaction. — PREMINT | NFT Access List Tool (@PREMINT_NFT) July 18, 2022 Premint is an NFT whitelisting service that allows NFT artists to access a large number of verified NFT collectors to whitelist them for new NFT projects.

In a statement on July 18, Marathon said that data center operator Applied Blockchain would contribute 254 megawatts of electricity with the potential to add 70 megawatts from additional suppliers, including Compute North. Marathon anticipates that this hosting agreement will enable them to meet its target of 23.3 EH/s by 2023.

They will each generate roughly 9.2 EH/s in total. At its site in Granbury, Texas, Compute North has the authorization from the relevant authorities to provide Marathon with 42 megawatts of hosting capacity. By the end of 2022, 26,000 mining units will be housed there, producing 3.6 EH/s, according to Marathon. Marathon added that several undisclosed suppliers would contribute up to 12 megawatts of hosting capacity, or 324 megawatts, valued at approximately 0.8 EH/s. Marathon’s decreased output was also partially caused by the closure of its Hardin, Montana, mining site on June 11 due to a strong storm.

MAS to Consult on Crypto Regulation Menon addresses the various failed crypto companies with links to the city, claiming they have “little to do with crypto-related regulation in Singapore,” including TerraForm Labs and Luna Foundation Guard – the companies behind the collapsed TerraUSD stablecoin, hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and lender Vauld. Menon said that the recently bankrupt Three Arrows Capital was not regulated under the Payment Services Act and had ceased to manage funds in Singapore, leading to its bankruptcy. Similarly, TerraForm Labs and Luna Foundation Guard aren’t licensed or regulated by the central bank, nor have they applied for any license or sought exemption from holding one. Menon stated that the crypto lender Vauld also doesn’t have a MAS license. He further said that MAS’ repeated warnings against retail investments in cryptocurrencies and “ratcheting up of policies to restrain retail access” has “raised some questions” about the regulator’s stance concerning the digital asset ecosystem. Addressing this issue, the central bank will organize a seminar next month to explain its strategies for developing Singapore as a digital asset hub. “We will set out how our developmental and regulatory approaches will work in harmony to achieve the vision of Singapore as an innovative and responsible digital asset hub,” he said.

Circle, the company behind USD Coin (USDC), has an estimated $54 billion in circulation. Disparte listed the 18 principles Circle had formed as part of its campaign to influence stablecoin legislation in the United States in a blog post on Monday. It emphasized privacy issues, the need for regulatory clarity, how stablecoins can coexist with a central bank digital currency, and the market for “a level playing field” between banks and non-banks regarding a U.S. dollar-pegged digital currency. Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Framework The Markets in Crypto-Assets Framework, or MiCA, legislation intended to unify cryptocurrency rules among E.U. member states, was passed by the European Union in June, according to the Circle CSO. To “prevent trans-Atlantic or worldwide misalignment” about stablecoin legislation, Disparte continued, the U.S. could play a leading role. President’s Working Group on Financial Markets released a report on stablecoin regulation in the U.S. in November. Stablecoin issuers should be subject to “appropriate federal oversight” under Congress’ jurisdiction, according to the policy recommendations, as the digital asset may develop to the point where it is “outside the regulatory perimeter” of the Securities and Exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Facebook’s Libra Stablecoin Project Before joining Circle in April 2021, Disparte was a part of Facebook’s Libra stablecoin project, which was eventually renamed, Diem. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, also spoke in congressional hearings on the digital asset sector in December 2021 before the House Committee on Financial Services and in 2019 before a Senate committee.

The same source said that the company was laying off due to what it described as “extreme cost-cutting.” The Winklevoss brothers founded crypto exchange reportedly cut 10% of its employees amid the bear market in June. Last week, a document about internal operations was shared on the anonymous professional network Blind, which was taken down shortly after. That document highlighted the company’s plans to cut the staff count by laying off staff from the current total of 950 employees. There is a probability that the document was shared by one of their employees, which made the co-founder of Gemini quite unhappy. “It’s come to my attention that at least one team member thinks it’s a good idea to post a snippet of our technology operating plan on a third-party website (Blind). Wow, super lame if you are leaking company information, you are exhibiting a low level of consciousness and respect for your fellow team members who greatly benefit from the openness we are trying to create and foster here.” Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founder of Gemini, wrote in a Slack message at the time. Besides Gemini, a wave of other major crypto companies have also laid off their employees in recent months. For instance, last week, NFT marketplace OpenSea reduced its staff by 20%. Several other firms, including Crypto.com, Coinbase, Bybit, and BlokFi, have also cut off their staff amid crypto market volatility.

94572,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=496065,1658210734,How Blockchain is Revolutionizing Business-Communication Networks,"The traditional model of communication networks is based on a centralized infrastructure where a single entity controls the entire network. This approach has several disadvantages, including vulnerabilities to attacks and information censorship. From a business standpoint, most enterprises rely on external entities for their communication infrastructure because of high construction and maintenance costs. However, this results in siloed communication networks lacking interoperability and having inefficiencies. Moreover, with the increasing use of email scraping tools, employees spend around two hours daily weeding out spam from essential emails. Considering such bombardment of organizational inboxes with unsolicited communications, giving individuals more control over who can message them is necessary. Leveraging blockchain technology and cryptography, innovative messaging platforms like TokLok address the above issues, as discussed in this article. Permissioned Networks, Private Communications A permissioned communication network is where the participant’s identity is duly verified, even if publicly undisclosed. Creating such networks is possible using blockchains where users can have a unique and cryptographically verifiable digital identity. One can use this identity to access services available only to authorized users. By enabling users to host private communication channels cost-effectively, blockchain also enhances data and information security. There’s minimal scope for censorship and privacy breaches since users have complete control over their communications data. Besides individuals, permissioned networks are particularly beneficial for enterprises requiring secure means of communicating sensitive information, both internally and externally. And in light of the above statistics, private and spam-free communications boost the overall productivity of the workforce. Thus, blockchain-powered networks can, indeed, transform business communications holistically. TokLok – Locking the Talk TokLok is a pioneer in using blockchain technology to ensure better, more secure business communications. The team thus set out to develop a flagship instant messaging application powered by the TokLok Token ($TOL). The Ethereum-based private messenger allows users to choose who can communicate with them. Moreover, besides strong encryption, TokLok ensures complete anonymity since it doesn’t store users’ messages. It is thus one of the most secure, end-to-end encrypted instant messaging applications. $TOL is an ERC-20 token necessary for accessing TokLok. It is available on the project’s official website, purchasable with BTC, ETH, Polish złoty (PLN), and Euro. As of July 7, 2022, TokLok has sold 15% of tokens allocated for its first round of public sales ending on July 15, 2022. Since early adoption is crucial for the project’s long-term development, it offers investors in this round exclusive benefits like passive income and lifetime access to the TokLok App. Talking About the Future It is evident that the need for better communication networks is real and pressing. The advantages of using blockchain to create permissioned communication networks are many. TokLok is thus utilizing the power of blockchain to build a safer and more efficient business communication network. As the world moves towards a more decentralized future, projects like TokLok will become increasingly relevant. In February 2022, the team launched the app’s iOS version and is currently focusing on token sales, implementing communicators in institutions, and introducing new features in the app.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ICO | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/how-blockchain-is-revolutionizing-business-communication-networks/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Elon Musk Plans to Countersue Twitter According to a new report from the New York Post citing sources close to the case, the purpose of the countersuit was to push a Delaware Court of Chancery judge to grant Musk’s legal team more time to gather information about Twitter bots. Musk argued that Twitter did not portray the number of spam/scam accounts in a recent 10-K filing and ultimately decided to pull out of the deal. Consequently, this caused Twitter to file a lawsuit last Tuesday, “Musk apparently believes that he unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.” Twitter wants the court to force Musk to purchase Twitter at the agreed-upon price of $54.20 per share, while Musk argues that he’s allowed to terminate the deal because Twitter has not been truthful regarding the number of bot/fake accounts on the platform. The first hearing in Twitter’s suit is scheduled for Tuesday when Delaware Court of Chancery chancellor Kathaleen McCormick is expected to weigh in on Twitter’s request for an expedited trial. While Twitter is pushing for a four-day trial starting in September, Musk wants it to open no earlier than February 2023.

Streak Of Green Candlesticks Indicate Recovery,"Strong technical indicators for the price of ethereum suggest that the bull run might only be beginning. Ethereum Has Bottomed? Ethereum [ETH] has had a recovery over the previous five days from its month-long demand zone in the $1,049 range. As a result of the recent run of green candlesticks, ETH is now under bullish control for the immediate future. At this time, the price of ethereum is $1,563. In response to the bear’s year-long suppression, the bulls are indicating a fierce retaliation. If the bears are unable to halt the bullish trend, ETH price will likely continue increasing towards $1,650. It has set a big objective mark at $1,450. ETH/USD trades at $1,563. Source: TradingView ETH lost more than half of its value in just nine days when it was in its previous downturn phase (from 10 June). As a result, on June 19, the alt drew closer to its 17-month low. However, the bulls promptly confirmed the $1,049-zone demand zone and promoted an up-channel (yellow) resurrection in the 4-hour timeframe. As a result of the increased bullishness, the 20 EMA (red) moved above the 200 EMA (cyan). The bears may attempt to test the $1,390 level again if they recover from the 61.8 percent level. A further breakdown from the up-channel could lead to a retest of the 20 EMA to the north before a likely recovery. Investors who took part in the bullish knife-catching trading setup from last week are 35 percent in the black. At $1,304, bulls looking to join the market would be invalidated. The price of Ethereum might drop by 45 percent if the bears break through this barrier and proceed to tumble toward $970.

Less than three weeks after Celsius halted its withdrawals, Voyager Digital followed suit, before it also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in SDNY on July 6.  Court filings paint a concerning picture for Celsius’ creditors, most of whom are average retail investors. The company has an enormous $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet (at least) – and retail depositors who held their crypto in Celsius accounts will likely be the last to get paid.  Chapter 11 bankruptcy, also called a “reorganization bankruptcy,” pauses any attempts at civil litigation from creditors, and allows the company time to get its finances in order to repay its debts.  Breaking down Celsius’ bad debt  Documents filed to the Southern District by the company’s law firm Kirkland & Ellis show that Celsius is deeply insolvent.  Read more: Looking at the Claims Celsius Operated Like a Ponzi  Leading up to declaring bankruptcy, Celsius saw its digital asset holdings dwindle to a mere $1.7 billion as of July 14, down from $14.6 billion since the end of March. The documents also show that Celsius owes $4.7 billion to its customers, almost three times what it holds in digital assets.  Celsius also holds $170 million in cash held in a bank, but the rest of the assets are tied up in mining equipment ($720 million), outstanding loans ($620 million) and other assets ($450 million). The documents also somehow account for $600 million in the platform’s CEL token, a much higher value than the total market capitalization of the coin. (The CEL token faces regulatory scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission.)  The firms claimed that most of the drop was due to the collapse in crypto prices, shrinking its assets by $12.3 billion.  The rest of the losses added up as:  Users withdrew $1.9 billion from deposits up until June 12, the date when the company suspended withdrawals.  Loan redemptions and liquidations reduced the firm's assets by another $1.9 billion.  Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, USDT, in the market and also an investor in Celsius, set back the firm by an additional $900 million when it liquidated a loan to Celsius. (Tether issued a statement about the liquidation.)  And the firm also lost $100 million from investments.  Another document filed for the court listed the crypto lender's “unanticipated losses to the business.""  Namely, the Ethereum staking platform StakeHound lost access to 35,000 ETH ($50 million at current prices) that Celsius deposited on the platform to earn a yield “due to an alleged error by StakeHound’s third-party crypto custody provider Fireblocks.”  StakeHound and Fireblocks are currently involved in litigation over the matter.  A private lender, reportedly the Indianapolis-based lending platform EquitiesFirst, failed to return the collateral of a loan Celsius paid off and owes $439 million to Celsius.  Celsius admitted it also lost about $15.8 million in Terra’s collapse, but the “widespread and completely misleading Twitter and social media commentary,” as the company’s legal advisor said during today’s hearing, prompted a run on its deposits in the first place.  A mining Hail Mary  Monday’s hearing – as well as a host of court documents, including a 61-page declaration from CEO Alex Mashinsky – indicate that much of Celsius’ plan to recoup its losses depends heavily on the projected future profits of its half-finished, wholly owned mining subsidiary, Celsius Mining.  However, that mining subsidiary is also a debtor. Lawyers for Celsius asked the court on Monday to approve over $5 million in spending to finish the construction of the mining center in Texas (which Celsius’ attorneys said would take approximately two more months), as well as pay duties on mining rigs “currently sitting with the customs authorities.”  Though Judge Martin Glenn, chief judge of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York, approved the request on an interim basis, the U.S. Trustee – the arm of the Department of Justice that oversees administration of bankruptcy cases– will ultimately hold the purse strings.  At Monday’s hearing, Shara Cornell, an attorney with the U.S. Trustee Program, voiced her concerns about the viability of Celsius’ mining operation.  “There’s one mining company that I don’t believe is currently operable, but has caused the debtor a considerable amount of money. I’m not clear if construction may or may not be the best avenue for the debtor at this time,” Cornell told the court. “Why not just consider liquidating it and move on?”  Celsius’ attorneys pushed back, claiming that Celsius’ operation already included more than 43,000 mining rigs, with plans to reach 112,000 mining rigs “sometime in Q2 of 2023.”  Pat Nash, Celsius’ lead attorney, told the court that the mining subsidiary was mining approximately 14.2 bitcoins (BTC) per day – and expected to mine 10,100 bitcoins in 2022.  “If everything goes well, in 2023 we hope and expect to be in a position to mine approximately 15,000 bitcoin a day,” Nash told the court (Nash presumably meant 15,000 bitcoins in the entire year, as only roughly 900 total bitcoins can currently be mined per day).  Retail customers will suffer  Even if Celsius’ promises to mine 10,100 this year are accurate (something that is difficult to independently verify), at current market prices that would yield approximately $225 million – only a fraction of what is needed to make Celsius’ solvent.  When Celsius begins to make good on its $5.5 billion in liabilities – $4.7 billion of which represents customer holdings – its customers will almost certainly be last to get their money back. And by then, there might not be any money left.  Read more: Celsius Bankruptcy Filings Hint Retail Customers Will Bear Brunt of Its Failure  “Celsius has set the stage for conflict between its customers and its sophisticated institutional investors,” Daniel Gwen, a business restructuring associate at New York-based law firm Ropes & Gray, told CoinDesk.  “In particular, Celsius has pointed out in its pleadings that customers transferred ownership of crypto assets to Celsius, making those customers unsecured creditors. This detail may undercut customer expectations, who thought they were depositing their assets into a construct similar to a traditional bank,” Gwen added.  Nash told the court on Monday that Celsius has approximately 500,000 depositors, 300,000 of which have more than $100 worth of crypto in their accounts.  Celsius’ attorneys asked the judge to redact names and other personally identifying information from Celsius’ creditor matrix and other documents, citing Celsius’ employees and corporate creditors’ fear for their personal safety.  “These cases have generated a lot of press and social media commentary. Certain employees have been receiving death threats and hate mail,” an attorney for Celsius told the court. “We received certain communications from scheduled corporate creditors stating that corporate principals have been receiving death threats and hate mail as well.”  Next steps for Celsius  The second hearing in Celsius’ bankruptcy proceedings will be held remotely on the morning of August 10.  The U.S. Trustee is currently in the process of forming and appointing a committee of creditors. These committees are typically made up of the seven largest unsecured creditors of the debtor, and help oversee the bankruptcy proceedings, investigate the debtor’s conduct and business operations, and help the court formulate a reorganization plan for the company’s debt.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,"Cheyenne Ligon, Krisztian Sandor",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/19/celsius-lays-out-mining-focused-reorganization-plan-at-first-bankruptcy-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1adcb539494678ff0b33e28ba24c2ea669d5715e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It has followed the path of an upward trendline and soared substantially. MATIC has continued its bullish price trajectory since a week and the asset brought double-digit gains. The altcoin has broken past several crucial resistance marks and now stands above the $0.77 support line. Pullback chances cannot be ruled out as the coin has been quite optimistic in the last week. Bitcoin recently touched the $22,000 level pushing major altcoins in the upward direction. The altcoin’s bulls are now in control as the buyers have regained confidence in the coin. MATIC was overvalued at the time of writing. Technical outlook for the coin remained bullish on the four hour chart. The altcoin has continued to form higher highs which are an indication of bullish strength on the chart. If the bulls keep up the present price momentum, MATIC will soon revisit the dollar mark. MATIC Price Analysis: Four Hour Chart The altcoin was trading at $0.903 on the four hour chart. MATIC was very close to revisiting $1.00. If buyers keep up the momentum, MATIC will continue to soar upwards. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $1.00. In case of a pullback, the closest support level for MATIC was at $0.77, below which stood the $0.68 mark. The altcoin has maintained an upward trajectory (yellow line) painting bullish picture on the chart. Amount of MATIC traded increased over the last few days and that is indicative of mounting bullish strength. Technical Analysis With increased buying momentum, the asset registered surplus buying strength. The indicators depicted the same on the four hour chart. The Relative Strength Index over the past few days have visited the overvalued zone. At press time, RSI was in the overbought zone. Usually a pullback occurs when the asset visits the overbought zone. The price of MATIC was also way above the 20-SMA line which is suggestive of buyers driving the price momentum in the market. Price above the 50-SMA and 200-SMA is considered to be sign of heavy bullishness. Related Reading | Bitcoin Breaks Above Realized Price Again, Bottom Finally In?

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $22,896, up more than 9% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is now perched above the $18,000 to $22,000 range it has held since mid-June roughly when crypto trading platform Celsius Network announced it was halting withdrawals and Coinbase (COIN) and a number of digital asset companies said they were cutting jobs.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, fared even better, recently climbing more than 19% over the previous day to trade at roughly $1,600. Markets continue to look hopefully at the Ethereum blockchain's Merge transition from a more energy-intensive proof-of-work to a more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake protocol. Other major altcoins assumed various shades of green, mostly on the deeper side, with ETC and SAND up over 13% and 10%, respectively, at one point.  Still, market observers were wary of sounding too upbeat, given the months-long backdrop of rising inflation, central bank uncertainty and the looming prospect of recession.  ""I'm bullish in the near term of like a week or two, but after that you have to be cautious because you still have all these macroeconomic headwinds,"" Hassan Bassiri, vice president, portfolio management for asset management firm Arca, told CoinDesk. ""And you still have no new capital flowing into the space. It's just us trading against each other.""  Cryptos tracked the general direction of stocks, which rose early before falling in the afternoon, although major equity indexes finished slightly in the red for the day with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 dropping 0.8%. The declines came largely after iPhone and computer manufacturer Apple (AAPL) announced it would ratchet back spending and hiring.  ""This is a very interesting time in the market now,"" Bassiri said. ""When Apple news came out, the market immediately pulled back, so there's still a strong correlation with traditional markets. But crypto is starting to decouple on a short-term basis. So it's very challenging to say with a lot of competence what's going to happen because the market is very player versus player.""  Crypto bad news continues  Troublesome news continued to flow from the crypto industry. Crypto broker Genesis Global Trading, a CoinDesk sister company, has filed a $1.2 billion claim against the now insolvent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, according to a 1,157-page court filing uploaded by bankruptcy trustee Teneo. The filing indicates that Genesis Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd., a subsidiary of Genesis Global, is seeking relief from Three Arrows regarding assets of $1.14 billion, as well as pledged AVAX and NEAR tokens worth a total of $91.3 million.  And court filings revealed that Celsius Network has a $1.2 billion hole (at minimum) in its balance sheet – the company has $5.5 billion in liabilities ($4.7 billion of which represents customer holdings) and only $4.3 billion in assets, much of which is illiquid. Though the company has already begun to make good on its debt to institutional creditors, retail investors have been left in the dark and will likely bear the brunt of Celsius’ failing.  Bassiri said that the rally over the past day stemmed from an Ethereum short squeeze. ""If the market structure is such that people are shorting and you can start a short squeeze against them, that can start triggering momentum algos (algorithms) and additional buyers,"" he noted. ""You're continuing to see that today.""  He added: ""Ether has a real reason to move because it has a catalyst coming.""  Insights  DappRadar's Complicated Valuation Model  Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are a tough asset class to value. As we’ve discussed before, there just isn’t a universally accepted way to value NFTs; three different services gave three different results when trying to value Three Arrows’ Starry Night collection.  NFT Twitter wants to see the value of their collective bag of JPGs hit the moon, so they weren’t happy that CoinDesk used DappRadar’s numbers to value Starry Night’s wallet at less than $5 million.  All sorts of accusations flew on Twitter about DappRadar’s methodology, so who better to talk to about how DappRadar actually works than Pedro Herrera, the company’s head of research, and Sarunas Simaitis, a consultant who works with the company in developing Machine Learning initiatives.  “I think the biggest challenge to any modeling of NFT valuations are opinions,” Simaitis said. “People have a lot of opinions about what the valuations should be and what there actually is. They confuse two things: prices and values, a lot.”  The two explained that DappRadar uses a machine learning regression algorithm that goes through all the historic sales as well as metadata and estimates a price of the NFT through interpolation.  While this might be seen as a prediction, it is more an interpolation of market and time with a consistent price retrieved via artificial intelligence (AI), DappRadar said in an email briefing. The result of the price interpolation is used as the valuation.  “[The model] starts to draw a line between metadata price and previous sales to estimate the potential market value of an NFT,” Herrera said. “It also starts to see how different is its estimate from the price from the previous sales, so it starts to adjust.”  Difficulties in estimating prices  And the reality is that estimating the price is difficult because it's a new asset class, and each collection has different characteristics.  “For example, one has the utility; the other one is more like a social exclusive club, so how do you really evaluate that? It's a challenge, but at a high level this is how it works,” Herrera said.  One thing the model looks out for is outlier events that would move the value of the market, such as last year’s record-setting Christie’s auction for a CryptoPunk and a Bored Ape.  “That's a type of sale that our model is, by design, designed to interpret poorly because that's a market-changing event,” Herrera said.  Because of the outlier nature of the sale, it would be weighted at a lower rating of importance to other market data.  But even as the crypto market slowly recovers from last month’s crash, DappRadar is still seeing interest from traders in the asset class – albeit the mentality has changed. Now, there’s a liquidity crunch in the sector, the DappRadar team says, because everyone is buying and holding, not selling, with the belief there are brighter days for valuations.  “I think looking at liquidity can give you a bit of a short-sighted view,” Simaitis said, because so many traders are waiting things out.  So the valuations of the bear market of 2022 just aren’t going to be the same as the good times of 2021. But, at the same time, will these values hold when the speculation dies?  “NFTs now, just like all assets, have two values: They have the fundamental value and the speculative value,” added Simaitis. “People actually don't know what that fundamental value is.”  Important events  9:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:30 a.m. UTC): Minutes from monetary policy meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia  10 a.m. HKT/SGT(2 a.m. UTC): Speech by Michele Bullock, assistant governor (Financial System) at the Reserve Bank of Australia  4 p.m. HKT/SGT(8 a.m. UTC): European Central Bank lending survey  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Chris Giancarlo on First Hearing in Celsius Bankruptcy Case; Ethereum Merge Update  Celsius Network revealed how it plans to protect customers as it prepares for its first hearing in New York bankruptcy court.
