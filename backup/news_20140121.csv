42425289,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0Jh,1390330212,"Las Vegas Casinos Accept Bitcoin, But Not for Gambling","The D Las Vegas Casino Hotel and Golden Gate Hotel & Casino have announced they will become the first hotels in Las Vegas to directly accept bitcoin for purchases.  Notably, acceptance will be limited to certain sections of the hotels, including the Golden Gate’s front desk and the D’s front desk, gift shop and on-site restaurants American Coney Island and Andiamo Steakhouse. However, bitcoin will not be an accepted payment method on the casino floor, Derek Stevens, co-owner and CEO of the D and Golden Gate, told CoinDesk, due to ongoing concerns from state regulators.  Golden Gate is primarily owned by Desert Rock Enterprises, an investment company led by Derek and Greg Stevens. The brothers are also co-owners of the D. From 22nd January, both properties will use the services of Georgia-based payment processor BitPay to handle transactions via tablet and mobile devices. Stevens said his company elected to use BitPay due to its ease-of-use.    The oldest hotel casino in Las Vegas (Golden Gate, built 1906) now accepts #bitcoin http://t.co/F7tGwqti39            — BitPay (@bitpay) January 21, 2014            Though patrons will be barred from bitcoin gambling, Stevens indicated that he believes his hotels have much to offer the currency's dedicated user base.  ""I'm hoping the early adopter element provides us an opportunity to meet what I consider to be an interesting and intelligent demographic.""  Davis went on to suggest the decision to accept bitcoin would also appeal to Vegas residents who have relocated to the city due to its growing status as a technology hub.  A big step for bitcoin  While bitcoin gambling services have long been a staple on the Internet, the decision by Golden Gate and the D puts real-life bitcoin gambling one step closer to reality, even if this milestone is still far off. Stevens indicated that Nevada's gaming regulation bodies remain wary of bitcoin and what it could mean for the city's businesses.  ""I don't think the [State] Gaming Control Board or [the Nevada] Gaming Commission would be prepared to deal with bitcoin at this point. But I do know that the Gaming Commission and Gaming Control Board have bitcoin on the radar, and are trying to evaluate what their future plans will be.""  ""I do think that from the Gaming Commission's perspective that there's some greater interest in understanding with some better clarity where the US Treasury and the IRS falls on this before it makes a determination on whether bitcoin can be used in casino cages to purchase casino chips or to purchase slot play,"" he added.  Still, bitcoin could mean big a new market for the hotels and Vegas at large, as it seeks to improve on recent record visitation figures. As of June 2013, one website in particular, SatoshiDice, was estimated to account for between 25% and 50% of all bitcoin transactions.  However, while notable, the D and Golden Gate are not located on the infamous Las Vegas strip, signaling that despite an increased interest from the area's hotels, bitcoin has not yet cracked mainstream acceptance in Vegas.  Built in 1906, Golden Gate was one of the first hotels erected on Las Vegas' famous Freemont Street. Today, the area is known affectionately as ""Old Vegas,"" and it draws more interest for its historic ambience than its nightlife.  This appeal is evidenced by advertising for properties such as the D, which is marketed to customers in the Great Lakes region of Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin, whereas major nightlife destinations such as The Cosmopolitan frequently advertise nationally in major metropolitan areas.  Top bitcoin attraction  In addition to hosting the annual Inside Bitcoins conference, Las Vegas has nurtured a thriving bitcoin community, complete with a number of local merchants and retail outlets accepting the currency.  Rumours that major hotels were considering accepting bitcoin began surfacing last year, however, sources told CoinDesk that issues with the local gaming commission may have hampered these early initiatives.  Stevens reported that the pressure may be on at many hotels, however, as he stated that the number of customers inquiring about bitcoin acceptance at his properties helped sway his decision to become involved in the movement:  ""I think if you look at the last 10 days with bitcoin, you have some pretty substantial announcements. You have an NBA franchise that makes an announcement, Overstock makes an announcement and now you throw us into it, I think it's definitely something that will continue to grow.""

42425298,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0Xh,1390325409,OKPAY Makes U-Turn on GBP to Bitcoin Transfers,"Web payments service OKPAY has announced that it will allow users to move pound sterling (GBP) into OKPAY web-based wallet accounts and then transfer these funds to cryptocurrency exchanges.      Rumours of the policy change by the merchant and consumer payment provider first surfaced on reddit and Bitcoin Talk after customers received emails. The announcement was later confirmed on 21st January via OKPAY's official Twitter account:      Fund OKPAY account by a GBP wire and then transfer funds to the crypto-currency exchangers: https://t.co/D7qEyDf0Jt      — OKPAY.com (@okpaycom) January 21, 2014      The company's email announcement suggests it made the move after changing its banking provider.      ""New bank does not have any restrictions regarding the further usage of funds on crypto-currency markets. Please feel free to fund your account using the updated banking details and use the money without any limitations,"" the email read.              Based in the British Virgin Islands, OKPAY bowed to pressure and cut its services to electronic currency exchanges back in May 2013. At the time, OKPAY cited the ""risks"" and ""potential dangers"" posed by anti-money laundering laws as the primary driver of the decision.      While limited to GBP, the move is indicative of OKPAY's shifting stance on bitcoin. The payment services provider has historically been adamant about its support for emerging virtual currencies: in November the company added support for litecoin payments. OKPAY's Konstantin Romanovsky said:      ""The UK bank that we used before did not make a final decision on whether to handle transactions in favour of crypto-currencies or not. Therefore the compliance department of the bank asked us to restrict such transfers.""              ""As of now we decided not to wait for the final decision and switched to alternative bank which does not have limitations of that matter,"" he added.    A tumultuous history  As one of the most prominent early bitcoin affiliates, OKPAY's announcement is noteworthy. After OKPAY abruptly curtailed wire transfer services to and from all bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox stopped accepting deposits via OKPAY before eventually cutting off withdrawalshttps://www.mtgox.com/pdf/20130528_okpay_statement.pdf to OKPAY accounts.    Still, despite the decision, OKPAY was firm in its support for virtual currencies. The company wrote in April 2013:      ""In many respects it breaks our heart to have taken this step (we’re a firm that champions financial innovation after all), but we know our banking providers are not comfortable with bitcoin and want payments to these firms restricted.""              ""This is happening everywhere – notably Bitfloor and Bitcoin-24 shut themselves down recently. The banks – just like everyone else in the sector – are nervous because they don’t know what to think of Bitcoin. The regulators and politicians’ silence on the topic leaves us all in the dark,"" the statement added.      OKPAY's policy shift comes just months after it stipulated that GBP users check a box, verifying that their funds would not be spent on cryptocurrency, a feature that further incited users.    User frustrations    Due to its long history of policy changes, frustrations have become an accepted, albeit maligned, part of OKPAY's service. Some reddit users have gone as far as to boycott the company, while others place the blame on the major banks OKPAY use, alongside its financial services provider Mayzus Financial. Reddit user mkellerman wrote:      ""OKPAY are quite paranoid about AML and another problem is that their support people seem to be very bad at English, so their replies are often hard to understand. Their support are also slow [sic]. However in my experience they are an honest company.""              OKPAY emerged as a popular way for bitcoin buyers to move fiat currency into the Bulgarian-based bitcoin exchange BTC-e, and it remains unclear whether this policy shift will restore both cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals.      Past statements from Mayzus indicate its partner banks include Deutsche Bank, Arab Jordan Investment Bank, Česká spořitelna and Barclays Bank. However, the company's most recent email indicates its UK provider has changed.

42425292,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0Nh,1390321818,25-Year-Old Arrested After Selling Gun for Bitcoin on Black Market,"A 25-year-old US citizen has been arrested in the US for allegedly selling a semi-automatic pistol to Dutch law enforcement officials in exchange for bitcoin.      This is according to the Amsterdam District Public Prosecutor, which revealed a semi-automatic weapon was purchased through an unidentified black market website on the supposedly anonymous Tor network.      The gun was sent disassembled, with its parts – including a silencer and laser pointer – concealed inside a DVD player, which allowed it to pass through customs.      Representatives from the Amsterdam District Public Prosecutor suggested that the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is prosecuting the case stateside, but the agency refused requests for comment on the case.      The arrest marks the end of an investigation that began last summer, when Dutch police and the Public Prosecution Service in Amsterdam set out to purchase illegal goods with bitcoin. An English translation of the press release reads:      ""Police and public prosecution wanted to investigate whether it is possible to purchase illegal products through the Tor network.""            Tor networks    Tor networks have long provided anonymity to 'dark web' sites like Sheep Marketplace, Black Market Reloaded and Silk Road, which facilitate the sale of illegal goods such as firearms, as well as legal items.      Speaking to CoinDesk in December, Tor's creator Roger Dingledine estimated that roughly 800,000 people use the Tor network each day, and reiterated that many use it to access ordinary websites on the Internet.      Documents leaked last October by US whistleblower Edward Snowden suggest the Tor network is secure, having withstood years of attempted breaches by government hackers. However, reports have suggested the network is less effective at protecting individual users.    Making the arrest    Though details about the new case remain scarce, the Public Prosecutor said the sender was already under surveillance by US law enforcement before the case began, a fact that perhaps contributed to the arrest. Further, the firearm was sent through standard mail, potentially providing another way for law enforcement to link the identity of the sender to the package.      Dutch officials say the purchase was made under an alias, and that the bitcoin payment was sent to a ""trust account which the supplier believed to operate anonymously"".      ""The suspect will be brought to trial in the United States because of illegal weapon export,"" the statement continued.      The automatic pistol involved in the exchange is not illegal in the US, it concluded.

42425293,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0Ph,1390318240,Cryptocurrency Exchange CoinMKT Announces US Banking Partner,"Los Angeles bitcoin exchange CoinMKT has announced a US-based banking partner. As a result, the company is now able to accept bank wires from US bank accounts.  Travis Skweres, CEO of CoinMKT, says he expects the company to grow as a result.  ""We're confident our growth will explode being able to accept wires deposits that can be credited same day or next day,"" he said.  Not many exchanges currently have the ability to accept banking wires, and the ones that do have experienced massive user expansion. Exchanges that have the ability to link directly to the US dollar via a banking institution are more attractive to investors. Skweres told CoinDesk that his company has added staff in order to meet the expected demand.  ""We have 8 employees now, so we have hired to enhance customer support as well as accelerate feature development.""  The company is also announcing the addition of three more altcoins to its exchange: Megacoin (MEC), Worldcoin (WDC) and Quark Coin (QRK). Terracoin (TRC), which CoinMKT is now referring to as ""problem plagued"", is being removed.  As a result, CoinMKT users can now trade between USD and nine cryptocurrencies in total. All of them are listed here, with informational resources for each. Additionally, users now have the ability to trade bitcoin for each of the eight altcoins. For example, there is a BTC/LTC pair for bitcoin/litecoin and a BTC/FTC pair for bitcoin/feathercoin trading.  Maker-taker structure  The company is also switching its commission structure to a 'maker-taker' setup. This adds an incentive for market makers, those who are selling a cryptocurrency on a particular market.  Essentially, it helps to better fill an order book, something that BTC China has already implemented. That exchange has seen impressive volume gains, which may partially be attributed to its maker-taker structure. Skweres observed:  ""This is a popular method in many FOREX (foreign exchange) platforms, and it's being experimented with in crypto, you're basically paying market makers to trade instead of charging them.""  Larry Harris, a professor at the USC Marshall School of Business, recently wrote a paper entitled 'Maker-Taker Pricing Effects on Market Quotations'. In his abstract, he writes that his research found ""the exchange maker-taker pricing scheme affects incentives to take or make markets resulting in narrower bid-ask spreads"".  The more narrow the spread is, the more liquidity that exists in an exchange as buyers and sellers are closer to bid and ask amounts.  That's good for cryptocurrency trading, since there's a general lack of that attribute in many exchanges. CoinMKT's new maker-taker commission structure means that the taker is charged 0.75%. CoinMKT then takes 0.5% as part of its fee, and the the maker is rewarded 0.25%.  Maker-taker aside, the US banking partnership is clearly the most significant of the company's announcements. Yet there are also many other options available for CoinMKT deposit and withdrawals, according to Skweres.  ""US customers now have the option of wire or money order. Foreign customers have wire, money order, OKPay or Egopay as choices,"" he said.

42425301,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0fh,1390314605,Sales Portal BitSimple Raises $600k in Bitcoin Seed Round,"Tangible Cryptography has announced the completion of a $600,000 seed round investment funded completely in bitcoin.  The company will use the funds to launch BitSimple, a new bitcoin sales portal that aims to set itself apart from traditional bitcoin exchanges.  Tangible Cryptography is not the first company to pull off a successful seed round in bitcoin. Last November Korean startup Coinplug did the same, raising $200,000 in the currency (alongside $200,000 in fiat).  BitSimple is described as a simple, fast and secure alternative to large bitcoin exchanges. It will allow users to buy and sell bitcoins directly from any digital wallet, which helps boost security. Traditional exchanges are centralized, and as such, are big targets for hackers and cyber criminals.  The security platform includes dedicated servers, a 100% offline wallet, paper backups, encrypted storage and smartcard secured access. In addition, there is no need to share sensitive information with strangers online, as BitSimple is a direct broker. The direct approach is also supposed to speed up the process, allowing transfers within hours rather than days.  Security concerns  Cyber attacks  and security breaches have already put a number of exchanges out of business. A recent report found that nearly one half of all bitcoin exchanges were destroyed by hackers or internal theft. More often than not, users of such exchanges see their accounts wiped out overnight. With Bitsimple’s approach, this is not an issue.  Lead developer Gerald Davis pointed out that BitSimple is not a wallet and does not contain the balances of customers who choose to use it. He explained:  “Users are free to secure their virtual currency as they see fit. With BitSimple, instant liquidity is still just a transaction away.""  This essentially means that every individual users is free to choose how to store their bitcoins. In doing so, BitSimple virtually outsources risk, leaving it up to users to select secure wallets. Davis added that the long-term goal is to expand BitSimple’s presence and deliver unmatched customer service.  It is interesting to note that Bitsimple is operated by North American Cryptographics, which is a subsidiary of Tangible Cryptography, but more importantly it is a FinCEN registered service.

42425304,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0lh,1390311277,"The Economics of Trust: Bob Geldof, Aid and Remittance","Yesterday, the Huffington Post reported on Sir Bob Geldof’s recent response to Russell Brand’s call for a revolution, in which Geldof claimed “bitcoin is a nice idea but it simply won’t work"".  Geldof's criticism wasn't based on his ignorance of the technology per se, or ignorance of economics in general, as Max Keiser suggested, but rather was an attack on monetary systems generally.  According to the Huffington Post he ""blamed the failure of capitalism on the banks going 'out of control' and due to human greed, inventing 'completely spurious' financial products"".  The crowning moment was when Geldof, who was addressing young entrepreneurs at the Huffington Post's incubator ""Rockstar Group"", a mentoring organisation, said:  ""You couldn’t have a system that deals with value through cash or money or any other value system. It won’t work. Bitcoin is a type of that, It simply won’t work. Nice, but it won’t work.”  Like Jesus knocking over the tables of the money changers on the steps of the temple in Jerusalem, or Paul proclaiming that ”the love of money is the root of all evil"", Geldof’s message is not simple bitcoin bashing as some bitcoiners have interpreted it as. Nor is it Krugman-style click bait a la the ‘Bitcoin is Evil’ headline in the New York Times recently.  Rather, Geldof's message is that merely changing the mechanics of money misses the larger point, that man’s inhumanity to man continues under all financially oriented systems. But this is where Sir Bob seems to have missed the potential of bitcoin to change the developing world’s economics from the ground up.  Global Remittance  According to statistics released by the World Bank, global remittance totalled somewhere between $400bn and $530bn in 2012, and it predicts that figure will grow to around $685bn in 2015, of which companies like Western Union and Moneygram plus banks themselves take a hefty chunk.  According to the Guardian’s report in January 2013:    ""The remittance phenomenon has been largely recession proof, although there was a dip in 2008/09, but the biggest complaint from migrants is the cut taken by banks and wire transfer firms.      The G8 wants the global cost of sending money lowered to an average of 5% by 2014, giving billions more to migrants' families.At present, the average fee is about 9%, meaning an average of $18 for every $200 sent, but in some parts of the world it tops 20%.""    The news provider report goes on to say: ""India and China were the biggest beneficiaries of remittances last year, each receiving more than $60bn, followed by the Philippines ($24bn), Mexico ($24bn), and Nigeria ($21bn). Egypt, the sixth largest, has seen the value of remittances surge from less than $9bn in 2008 to nearly $18bn last year.""  Recently, CoinDesk reported on the Philippines as the third-largest global market for remittances with an estimated 2.2 million Filipino expats around the world sending home around $13.9bn last year alone.  New companies like BitPesa in Kenya and MEXBT have proposed that they could lower the remittance fee to as low as 3%, and with Mexico’s annual remittance accounting for 10% of the Mexican economy, Mexican banks and businesses have reportedly been keen to jump on board.  In addition, according to business week, Ripple recently announced ""it would begin transferring cash into its network at the hundreds of thousands of convenience stores, pharmacies, and other businesses around the world where ZipZap payments are accepted"", which would be Ripple’s first step toward cracking the global remittance market.  Western Union (WU), which recently introduced a mobile service enabling cash-to-mobile, mobile-to-cash and mobile-to-mobile transfers, netted $4.6bn in transaction fees in 2012 and $1bn in foreign-exchange revenue. Meanwhile, Safaricom the telecom that runs the hugely successful M-Pesa in Kenya, and handles domestic remittance, reported record half-year profits of KSH11bn ($128m) in November of last year.  ZipZap charges a flat fee of $3.95 to send up to $500 in cash, so were they to supplant Western Union as the world's money transmitter of choice they could potentially profit by as much as $1bn a year.  Thus, whilst Krugman may proclaim that ‘bitcoin is evil’, there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that exactly the reverse is true. In contrast, Paypal and other payment networks are blocked in many developing countries, so rather than Bitcoin being ‘an antisocial network’, it's highly likely that it will help spur growth and development in the world’s poorest economies, if used appropriately and responsibly and alongside the existing social networks like facebook and twitter. One such company that uses these networks already to confirm transactors identities for example is Dealcoin, run by Hakim Mamoni.  Detractors note that using bitcoin for remittance might be unethical and that, with its wild fluctuations in value and its experimental nature, the west shouldn't, in good conscience, be pushing the technology on some of the world's poorest people. The response from remittance companies is that users who are sending bitcoin back home only need to hold it for a maximum of 20 minutes, between buying the bitcoin from a local exchange in the UK, and having it paid into their family's bank-account back home.  Companies like Buttercoin are working with money transmitters in Canada and India to implement bitcoin behind the scenes, so that consumers will never have to interact with bitcoin at all, claiming they will aim to take less than 1% commission on transfers. Cedric Dahl, Buttercoin’s CEO said: ""Migrant workers who are using the system may not know what bitcoin is, but they are going to use it.""  Aid vs Remittance  Geldof probably hasn’t understood the ramifications of bitcoin yet, but it’s precisely for aid activists like Geldof, that the potential impact of Bitcoin technology must be clearly understood.  Aid from rich to poor countries has often been criticised as being a corrupting influence on developing economies. Aid is often a one-way street which hides political agendas and holds the weaker country to ransom, whilst remittance is characteristically a-political.  Aid does not tend to stimulate a country's economy in the same way that remittance can and as global annual remittance accounts for around three times annual global aid there are serious questions being asked about the efficacy of aid to developing nations in comparison to remittance. Some parties are even asking if aid could be entirely replaced by migrant remittance with lower fees, suggesting that a more stable, healthy, balanced global economy could be achieved as a direct result of a decentralised (bitcoin-based) remittance model.  Bitcoin observer Andreas Antonopoulos has continually noted in recent months that there is a desperation in developing economies for this technology, a sentiment backed by Tomas Alvarez, CEO of latin-american remittance service Coincove, who says in the Pan-American Post: “The allure of bitcoin mainly rests on its potential to protect us from governments that mismanage their economies (often resulting in currency debasement), a situation to which no Latin American is a stranger.”  Economy of Trust  What bitcoiners are really building is a decentralised alternative economy with a ‘trustless’ cash network, creating communities based on trust and reputation as they go. That’s a big deal in a global village when your digital community is made up of friends in cities all over the world, and it’s especially a big deal when your family is spread out over different continents and you are forced to send money home to support them.  Bitcoin may stand poised to help change the distribution of global wealth by taking the financial monopolies of the pound, dollar, euro, renminbi and yen on at their own game.  It may take them outside the traditional playing fields of the developed nations, who relentlessly collude and compete to create bottlenecks in trade between developing economies which they can then leverage and exploit as competitive advantages against one another. But while bitcoin may have the capacity to reform global charity, it’s first big challenge is the remittance industry, disrupting those transfer monopolies at their root and routing around the damage that they’ve caused.

42425295,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0Th,1390303811,Miami's North American Bitcoin Conference Releases Full Schedule,"The North American Bitcoin Conference is coming to Miami Beach on 25th January.  Over 500 people are expected to attend the event to learn about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There will also be 20 exhibitors showing off their bitcoin-related products and services.  Moe Levin, the conference's organiser, says the decision to host the conference on a weekend will make for a big turnout. Levin, who also organised a bitcoin-related conference last year in Amsterdam, said:  “It's the weekend before the Super Bowl, and it's in sunny Miami Beach. We thought it would be the best time to host it where people wouldn't need to take [time] off work and could enjoy the sun for a weekend then go back to work.""  A social gathering is being held at the Clevelander Hotel on 24th January, the night before the conference officially starts. Levin said: “The networking event will be a sponsored event by three different companies at 7pm at the Clevelander in a private area upstairs and will continue to the main bar.”  This event may enable those curious about bitcoin to join in without having to commit to the full two days of sessions discussing virtual currencies. “It's going to be well attended by everyone from the conference looking to network, and by any enthusiast in Miami looking to meet people but might not be able to make it out to the conference.”  Attendees are encouraged to download the conference’s mobile app, called BTC Miami. The app is in the Google Play Store for Android and Apple's App Store for iOS devices.  “The app is a really powerful tool to connect with other attendees, learn about exhibitors, find out what's happening where and earn points for checking in to different events.”  Levin says that the app will help organizers decide how to improve the event in the future. “We are also paying close attention to the reviews and scores of all the speakers so we can see where we did well and where needs improvement.”  The finalized program, which details more about the speakers and panelists, is located here. It also includes parking information and a map of the conference center.

42425309,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0vh,1390299351,Marijuana in Colorado Faces Same Legal Obstacles as Bitcoin,"Bitcoin and marijuana, at least in terms of US legal issues, have more in common than you might think.  Consider the situation that has developed in the state of Colorado: on 1st January it became the first US state to allow the sale of recreational marijuana.  Customers who can identify themselves as aged 21 or older can now walk into a dispensary and buy the drug in regulated quantities.  An increasingly informed and engaged populace is influencing trends like this one. The web, alongside mobile devices and social media, has allowed people to campaign for causes like never before.  The network effects of bitcoin will likely see this same influence as adoption increases. The banking industry’s hands-off approach to legalized marijuana in Colorado often mirrors the industry's reaction to bitcoin.    Bank involvement    While it has been reported that at least one Colorado marijuana dispensary is accepting bitcoin, none are advertising that fact publicly. Right now, the major choices are twofold in stores that sell pot: the acceptance of cash or plastic. However, as it stands, credit cards are operating in a grey legal area.  Clearly, dispensary operators have found that cash is king in this new industry. Funnily enough, that makes the payment option for buying legal weed not much different than that of illegal methods.  The New York Times recently recounted how legal marijuana sellers in Colorado must contend with handling massive quantities of cash, drug dealer-style. Why? Simply put, banks in Colorado don’t want to deal with money culled from a weed-based business, legal or not. Banks are afraid of regulators, and in the federal government’s eyes, pot is still illegal.    Credit cards and marijuana    Cash is the most common option for buying legal weed, although some dispensaries are reportedly accepting credit/debit cards. But what do dispensaries do if a credit card company refuses to do business with them?  According to the Wall Street Journal,  Visa is treating credit card-based pot sales with a touch-and-go approach that puts the onus upon merchant banks. MasterCard says that it considers using its cards to buy marijuana as illegal.  And American Express is being proactive, monitoring weed shops trying to accept the company’s cards and blocking them.  This lack of clarity from processors is likely to make marijuana dispensaries in Colorado leery.  The threat of a chargeback or other procedural misgivings from these credit card companies must weigh as a factor towards just taking cash. That's straight money in the bank. But unfortunately, banks are another integral part of the problem. Visa, for example, seems to be letting merchant banks make the decisions on processing plastic-based marijuana payments.  Just like the rare bitcoin exchange that successfully operates in the US with a banking partner, these types of relationships are scarce. Like exchanges, dispensaries generally decline to reveal who their banking partners are to protect their relationship.    Banking control    For credit card companies, legalized marijuana is all about holding down the appearance of control at this point. It all originates with compliance in banking; after all, there’s surely a degree of money laundering and other illicit use by some payment processors with credit cards being a facilitator.  Banks are simply mitigating risk by not publicly doing business with marijuana dispensaries because that type of business is illegal at federal level.  That may soon change. Jack Finlaw, chief legal counsel to Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, says that the federal government ""will give maybe not a green light but a yellow light"" for banks to work with marijuana-based businesses soon.  That could be favorably compared with FinCEN’s guidance regarding bitcoin last year. In that case, it was a sign that government regulators would not try to simply shut out bitcoin-based businesses, but try to work with them within a framework of compliance instead.  With marijuana, as with bitcoin, the government may see that popular opinion is swaying towards innovation and legalization. Consider that an effort to decriminalize marijuana in Washington DC is underway – with the city’s public safety panel possibly dropping infractions down to a parking ticket.  The capital has already passed a law legalizing medical marijuana. In turn, non-profit decriminalisation efforts like the DC Cannabis Campaign already accept bitcoin. Virtual currency and pot will likely continue to intermingle with one another in this way to help shape decriminalization.    The issue of anonymity        Many people are suspicious of credit card companies’ collecting personally identifiable information. After all, if companies like MasterCard and American Express are saying that they will block pot-based transactions, that means those organizations are paying very close attention to purchases happening in Colorado in order to enforce these policies.  The problem with any sort of privacy with buying marijuana is that it actually isn’t really possible anyways. Amendment 64, the Colorado statewide drug addendum to its constitution, strictly forbids the collection of personally identifiable information when someone buys legal marijuana. But state rules require that dispensaries use video surveillance that is aimed at a store’s point of sale to clearly show the buyer and the seller.  Bitcoin can be anonymous, but with legalized pot that doesn’t matter. Because of this, it is a novel idea that bitcoin might be used for legal pot transaction. Yet, while the drug is legal in Colorado, it is still considered illegal by the US government. And while bitcoin is, by all accounts, considered legal by the US government, regulatory laws in Colorado (or any other state) have not been made quite so clear.  This has created a precarious footing for any combination of both bitcoin and pot. Although it seems like a sensible pairing, the continued loose compliance in these different arenas makes it more logical for dispensaries to roll the dice with cash and possibly credit cards.  Hopefully that will change at some point, as the use of bitcoin as a payment method for a legal product on the US market could actually help to give it some credence.

42425302,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0dh,1390285385,University of Cumbria First in UK to Accept Bitcoin,"A university in the UK has announced that it will accept bitcoin payments for two new programmes linked to the study of cryptocurrencies and complementary currencies.  The courses are run by the Institute for Leadership and Sustainability at the University of Cumbria. The institute's director, Jem Bendell said:  ""We are accepting bitcoin as a way of experimenting [with] how it works for a major organisation with many departments.""  The two programmes run by the institute are a certificate in sustainable exchange and a post-graduate certificate in sustainable leadership. The first is taught at the university's London campus and will begin in July; the second is taught at its Lake District campus and will begin in June.  The university's head office is in Carlisle in the north of England. It has nine campuses and accepts roughly 10,500 students each year. It is known for its teacher training programmes and outdoor study degrees.  The institute has a history of involvement with alternative currency research. Last May it was one of seven partners that helped organise a United Nations symposium (PDF) on alternative finance and complementary currencies. It also has a research programme on the topic that includes PhD students.  'Complementary currencies' is a term used to describe forms of money that supplement a national currency. It is often used interchangably with 'alternative currency', however the term's exact definition is the subject of an ongoing academic debate.  In a press release announcing the move, the university claimed that it is the world's first public university to accept bitcoin for tuition fees. It also noted that it is the first British university and the first business school to do so. When asked if the move to accept bitcoin for tuition was simply a savvy marketing move to generate publicity for the university, Bendell said:  ""Certificates generally don't generate media attention. The acceptance of bitcoin will generate interest. However, it's a normal thing for us to do, as we believe our teaching should be informed by our experiences.""  The certificate in sustainable exchange will teach students how to ""create, scale and evaluate digitally-enabled systems of sustainable exchange"". Students will also explore the link between these systems and the emerging ""sharing economy"", which includes systems like Airbnb, according to the course description. The programme is classified as a ""short course"" by the university. The certificate costs £1,111.  The post-graduate certificate in sustainable leadership is a year-long course where students will be asked to challenge ""orthodoxies in corporate social responsibility and environmental management"". Students on the course will be able to learn about sustainable exchange in an elective module. This certificate costs £3,333.  However, the university warned prospective students against buying bitcoin to pay for tuition in its press release. It said that students should only pay in bitcoin if they already owned the cryptocurrency or if they received bitcoin donations – due to the currency's volatility risk. The institution plans to convert bitcoin payments to pounds sterling at the time of payment via BitPay, thus reducing its own exposure to the digital currency's price volatility.  The University of Nicosia in Cyprus, a private institution, announced in November that it would take bitcoin for tuition fees. It also launched a master's degree in digital currency.

42425296,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0Vh,1390281071,Canadian Economic Institute Has High Hopes for Bitcoin,"Could bitcoin reinvigorate Canada's creaking payment system? A prestigious Canadian economics institute has released a report suggesting that bitcoin could become a ""common currency"" and reduce payment costs, if only regulators would provide clarity. It unveiled the report just as the Canadian government declared that bitcoin wasn't legal tender.  The Montreal Economic Institute, a Quebec-based non-profit research organisation, said that although bitcoin use is still marginal, ""recent developments suggest that this use is bound to increase.""Citing CoinDesk, the report suggests that merchant bitcoin sales are surging.  Bitcoin's big advantage is its inexpensive payment system, said David Descôteaux, the report's author. This enables people to send payments to people relatively cheaply, the document said - especially overseas.  But could bitcoin also be a useful alternative to payment systems in Canada? A 2011 report from a Government-commissioned Task Force, called Moving Canada in the Digital Age, suggested that Canada lagged far behind in its payments systems.  ""Unless Canada develops a modern digital payments system, Canadians will be unable to fully engage in the digital economy of the 21st century,"" said the report, adding that the country lagged behind ""Twenty-seven European Union countries, the BRIC countries‚ even Peru and Romania"" in its digital payments innovations.  Canada does have a money-by-email system called Interac, but it isn't instantaneous, and the country still lags in mobile payment mechanisms, the three year-old report warned.  ""The key words in that report are a more efficient system, a cheaper system, more open, more democratic and better governance. All the keywords I was reading apply to bitcoin,"" said Descôteaux of the 2011 report. ""There's a reflection on what money should be in the future, and it is going more and more towards the digital side. Sometime, government plans will probably meet with bitcoin popularity.""  The MEI report - really little more than a primer on bitcoin - was released last week, shortly before a Canadian government official reportedly said that the authorities there did not consider bitcoin to be legal tender.  This didn't faze Descôteaux, though, who pointed out that the Canada Revenue Agency had already issued guidance classifying bitcoin as a form of physical good, rather than as money.  ""The regulators must be in many other countries thinking about it. What they say right now doesn't mean that they won't change their mind. And even if it's not legal tender, it doesn't stop anyone from using bitcoins,"" he concluded. ""As long as it isn't illegal, it isn't a threat to bitcoin's popularity.""  The Institute will publish a more in-depth report exploring the regulatory landscape for bitcoin in April.

42425291,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHw0Lh,1390279271,Bylls Lets Canadians Pay Bills in Bitcoin,"Canadian government officials may not think that bitcoin is legal tender, but thanks to a new startup, you can still pay your taxes in it - along with a lot of other bills. Canadian firm Bylls has become one of the first to offer bill payment in bitcoins. The service, only available in Canada at present, enables users to pay around 6,000 Canadian organisations - including the government - in bitcoins, by handling the fiat conversion for you.  Started by Eric Spano, Bylls was incubated at the Bitcoin Embassy, a bitcoin education and advocacy group in a 14,000 square-foot building in Montreal. The Embassy also recently became the Canadian affiliate chapter for the Bitcoin Foundation.  This isn't Spano's first rodeo. He has a background in finance, and originally founded a local bitcoin trading website called Northland Bitcoins. Canadian bank RBC closed that site's bank account, around the same time that it closed the account for Canadian bitcoin exchange Virtex. But instead of being discouraged, Spano searched for a new business model.  ""That fed the fuel for the next idea which was Bylls. There are places to buy things with bitcoin, but what if you're the average person with phone and credit card bills to pay, or you want to pay the rent?"" he asks.  Most large utilities aren't equipped for bitcoin, which is irritating for miners or enthusiasts holding coins. ""I figured why not take advantage of the financial system that already exists and enable them to interface together?""  He's talking about the Canadian online banking system, which is already set up to process fiat payments to a large database of established payees. Most banks in Canada have a 'pay bills' area, enabling customers to select everything from municipal governments to pay their property tax, through to their phone bills. And the Canadian Revenue Agency is a payee.  ""The online system does allow users to pay their taxes (federal, most provinces and some municipalities), so yes technically taxes can be paid with Bitcoin,"" Spano confirms.  Strictly speaking, you actually pay Bylls in bitcoin. You then provide it with your account information for the relevant payee. It sells the bitcoins at the market rate on Canadian exchange Virtex, and settles the payments itself in fiat currency, via a payment processor.  Fees and limits  Opening up 6,000 companies in Canada for bitcoin payments is quite a leap. For those payees not listed, Spano urges his customers to simply pay on their credit card, and then just pay the card off in bitcoin at the end of the month.  Users can pay up to $1000 in bills per month if unverified, or $5000 if they verify using the miiCard system. The fee structure starts at $3 for smaller bills, and progresses up to $6 for bills between $150 and $499. After that, Bylls charges 1%. Spano is also considering a subscription-based model.  The one missing link here is recurring bill payments, which would be useful for people with regular monthly payment plans, say, for their rent, gas or electricity bills. Those people will have to remember to conduct payments manually, admits Spano.  In other news, Canadian bitcoin exchange Vault of Satoshi is trialling its own integration with the Canadian bills payment system. Rather than allowing people to pay their bills from their Vault of Satoshi account, however, it will allow customers to send money to the exchange, once verified, enabling them to load their accounts from the bank. The firm is also beta testing a pre-authorised debit service.""  ""We are able to use bill payments with the top six banks, and with pre-authorised debit we cover every bank in Canada including credit unions,"" said VoS founder Michael Curry.
