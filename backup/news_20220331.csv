13220440,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=487338,1648771150,Possible Timelines For Bitcoin To Hit $100k: Why CEOs See Bullish Signs,"After bitcoin broke above the $45k resistance level reaching the $48k mark, it has retested the $45k level. Some analysts still expect a rise to above $50k, others have abandoned their bullish approach. Meanwhile, leading CEOs from Pantera Capital and Skybridge Capital remain positive that the coin will reach the $100k mark in a period of one to two years. Pantera Capital CEO Is &apos;Wildly Bullish&apos; In an interview with Yahoo Finance, the CEO of Pantera Capital Dan Morehead commented on Bitcoin&apos;s price action so far in the year. Morehead noted that within the history of Bitcoin cycles, it&apos;s had six previous bear markets that average about 60%, and 2022&apos;s has been 50%. In his opinion, the bitcoin cycles will begin to moderate thanks to large institutional engagement, and &apos;a 50% bear market is probably all you&apos;re going to get going forward.&apos; &apos;I think we&apos;re either at the lows or very close to it.&apos; Morehead said he is &apos;wildly bullish right now&apos; because he believes that Bitcoin and the asset classes will decouple, noting that the high correlation that usually happens during periods of stress -similar to 2022&apos;s turmoil- eventually breaks, usually after a 72-days average. &apos;I think stocks and bonds may keep going down potentially for years, whereas blockchain assets can go up.&apos; Morehead accepted that Pantera Capital failed to predict how fear over the Fed&apos;s rate...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/possible-timelines-for-bitcoin-to-hit-100k-why-ceos-see-bullish-signs/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42374953,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4dkL,1648767797,"First Mover Asia: Tailwinds for South Korea's Crypto Industry; Bitcoin, Ether Plunge","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies decline.  Insights: The South Korean crypto industry has had some good news lately.  Technician's take: BTC is declining from overbought levels; support at $43K.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $45,808 -2.7%  Ether (ETH): $3,292 -2.7%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Solana SOL +3.2% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin Cash BCH +1.3% Currency Algorand ALGO +0.7% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Filecoin FIL −5.1% Computing Internet Computer ICP −5.1% Computing Litecoin LTC −4.9% Currency  Bitcoin, other major cryptos plunge  Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies plunged on Thursday amid worsening inflation numbers and a vote by the European Union on crypto legislation that the industry viewed unfavorably.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at under $46,00, a more than 2% drop over the past 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was similarly off for the same period and changing hands at about $3,300. A number of prominent altcoins were faring even worse, suggesting lessened risk appetite among investors. Meme coins DOGE and SHIB were recently off about 3% and 4.5% respectively.  Major cryptos' performances dovetailed with those of equity markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were all down 1.5%. Traditional safe havens such as gold and the U.S. dollar rose, while the 10-year Treasury yield continued to decline from Tuesday's high of 2.5%, as CoinDesk reported.  The U.S. central bank's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index (PCE), showed annual inflation rose 6.4% in February, the Labor Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday. The inflation rate accelerated from the 6% clip reported a month ago. The February pace was the highest since 1982.  Some crypto traders watch inflation readings closely because the bitcoin (BTC) market sometimes moves after economic indicators are released. Some investors hold bitcoin as a protection against inflation. The report also showed that consumer spending slowed to 0.2%, from 2.7% in January. Bitcoin at least initially did not react to the news.  European Union lawmakers voted in favor of controversial measures to outlaw anonymous crypto transactions, a move the industry said would stifle innovation and invade privacy. The proposals are intended to extend anti-money laundering (AML) requirements that apply to conventional payments over EUR 1,000 (US$1,114) to the crypto sector. They also scrap the floor for crypto payments, so payers and recipients of even the smallest crypto transactions would need to be identified, including for transactions with unhosted or self-hosted wallets.  Meanwhile, lawmakers worldwide continued to look for ways to protect consumers from further increases in energy prices stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On Thursday, the Biden administration said it was considering the release of about 180 million barrels of oil over the next six months from the U.S.'s reserves at a rate of one million barrels per day. The price of Brent crude oil, a frequently watched measure of energy prices, was recently selling at about $105 per barrel, down about 1%.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,530 -1.5%  DJIA: 34,678 -1.5%  Nasdaq: 14,420 -1.5%  Gold: $1,937 +0.1%  Insights  Crypto in South Korea has enjoyed a tailwind lately.  Earlier this week, The Korean Herald reported that SK Square, the investment arm of South Korean conglomerate SK Group, would spend 2 trillion won (US$1.6 billion) in the next three years on semiconductors and blockchain.  “This will mark the first year when SK Square creates new shareholder value by investing in chips and blockchain, the fields that we are familiar with, and we see a high growth potential,” Park Jung-ho, CEO and vice chairman of SK Square, told The Korean Herald on Monday.  Seoul-based SK, which has 95 separate companies in chemicals, logistics, energy and materials, among other sectors, has been looking to broaden its portfolio. It is South Korea's third-largest conglomerate. The interest of a so-called chaebol reflects South Korean investors' and entrepreneurs' surging interest in crypto.  The firm plans to introduce its own token before the end of the year, according to a report last week by the Korea Economic Daily last week. SK Square, has set up a blockchain task force that is responsible for the project.  The token would be the first of its kind launched by any company under the purview of South Korea's top 10 conglomerates. The cryptocurrency will be aimed at integrating virtual economies across the group's businesses, the Economic Daily reported.  SK Square is also the largest shareholder of SK Hynix, the world's second-largest memory chipmaker after Samsung. In November 2021, SK Telecom spent KRW 87.3 billion acquire a 35% stake in crypto exchange Korbit.  SK Group's most recent initiative follows close behind the election of one of two presidential candidates who promoted crypto-friendly proposals in an effort to win younger voters. Yoon Suk-yeol, the conservative candidate who won the election, said he would take legal measures to confiscate crypto profits gained through illegitimate means and return them to the victims.  ***  India's passage of a finance bill with high taxes will hinder the fledgling industry's innovation and growth, the bill's opponents say.  “Treating profits and losses of each market pair separately” will discourage crypto participation and throttle the industry's growth,” said Nischal Shetty, CEO of crypto exchange WazirX, in a statement. “It’s very unfortunate and we urge the government to reconsider this.”  The crypto measures impose a daunting 30% capital gains tax on crypto transactions and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) with no offsetting losses. Industry advocates had hoped to convince lawmakers to limit at least the source tax.     Technician's take  Bitcoin Dips From $48K Resistance; Support at $43K  Bitcoin (BTC) is in pullback mode after sellers responded to resistance at $48,000. The cryptocurrency could find support at $43,000 into the Asia trading day, which could stabilize the down move.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is declining from overbought levels, which typically precede pullbacks in price. On the weekly chart, however, the RSI is neutral with positive momentum readings. That means buyers could remain active at lower support levels.  Still, BTC is attempting to break below a two-week long uptrend, similar to what occurred in early February, which preceded a brief price drop.  For now, buyers will need to maintain the breakout above $45,000 to yield an upside target toward $50,966.

This is a far cry from what was expected after China, which was known as the mining capital of the world at that point, had laid a blanket ban on crypto mining. Bitcoin miners had been able to successfully set up in other regions of the world and mining activities have ramped up since then. This time around, it comes along with the growth of blocks mined per hour which has smashed all expectations. Not only has the mining difficulty been affected by this but its effects are being felt all around the mining industry. Bitcoin Mining Difficulty At New ATH? Block production rates have risen higher than anticipated to beat the previous target of 6 blocks mined per hour. This number now stands at 6.2 blocks mined in an hour. This increase in block production has led to an increase in mining difficulty which has pushed it towards new all-time highs. Going forward, there is expected to be a 4-5% difficulty adjustment in mining difficulty. Related Reading | Cardano Turns Bullish In The Short-Term, But Is That All? If this happens, it will easily send the bitcoin mining difficulty towards a new all-time high.

42374949,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4dgZ,1648764716,Newly Introduced Bill Aims to Bring Transparency to the Stablecoin Marketplace,"The days of murky stablecoin reserves might soon be over.  Two U.S. lawmakers, Rep. Trey Hollingsworth (R-Indiana) and Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), introduced a bill in both the House of Representatives and Senate on Thursday aimed at bringing greater transparency to the stablecoin marketplace.  The aptly named “Stablecoin Transparency Act” would set standards for the “quality of assets held in reserves” as well as require stablecoin issuers to report on their reserves.  If passed, the bill would have a significant impact on stablecoin issuers including Circle and Tether, whose stablecoins' backing has been the source of much speculation in the crypto industry.  Tether, by far the largest stablecoin issuer, has been especially secretive about its reserves for USDT. The company has kicked the can on promises to issue audits on its reserves and has fought tooth and claw to keep information away from the public.  The now-$180 billion stablecoin market has also become a concern for regulators, many of whom have voiced concerns about potential exposure risks for the broader economy in the event of a “run” on stablecoin issuers.  Lawmakers are trying to find a solution that protects consumers and the economy without stifling innovation. Hollingsworth sees his bill as a step in the right direction.  “This bill isn't going to solve everything,” Hollingsworth told CoinDesk. “But it is an incremental step towards the unveiling of a balanced approach between development, technology and protection of consumers.”  Hollingsworth said he’s been amazed by the outpouring of support for the new bill, both from fellow lawmakers and industry participants.  “Even in its infancy of being introduced, we've just seen tremendous support on how this is a really thoughtful first step,” Hollingsworth said.  Good actors vs. bad actors  Hollingsworth believes the bill, whether it eventually passes or not, will give stablecoin issuers a sneak peek at where Congress is headed with stablecoin regulation.  “Even presenting this and dropping this to Congress is a signal to industry where we are headed,” Hollingsworth told CoinDesk. “They can begin to make decisions and move in that same direction.”  Hollingsworth wants to ensure that “good actors” in the stablecoin sphere – those that are interested in regulatory compliance – get the clarity necessary to make decisions about investments, regulation, and how to continue to develop the technology.  “Good actors in the space want to see the bad actors removed from the space, precluded from acting in the space, so that one bad actor will not besmirch the good reputation and good efforts of the entire industry,” he said.  Though Hollingsworth declined to name names on which stablecoin issuer he considered a “bad actor,” other representatives, including crypto-friendly Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), have pointed fingers at Tether.  Global reach  Though most stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar, Hollingsworth felt it was important to craft a bill that did not have a limited scope.  “We’re working as broadly as possible with industry and consumers globally to make sure we’re coming out with a thoughtful framework,” Hollingsworth said. “That’s one of the reasons, frankly, why the bill isn’t dollar-specific.”  “I don’t want to be behind the curve when this bill gets passed and then have to amend it to reflect the different currencies that people are issuing stablecoins in,” he added.  Even if the bill is passed, implementation of the new requirements won’t be immediate.  “Agencies have to act upon the laws Congress passes,” Hollingsworth said. “But I think the effect is immediate, because everyone knows this is going to be the law. So everyone starts to comply, even ahead of the enforcement.”",POSITIVE,USDT,MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | USDT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/31/newly-introduced-bill-aims-to-bring-transparency-to-the-stablecoin-marketplace,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99af29c72ecc17cc2a9196dec317eb4ce05c4875-5587x3725.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374946,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4dcn,1648764560,OpenSea Exec Who Quit After ‘Insider Trading’ Scandal Is Back With NFT Platform,"Ex-OpenSea executive Nate Chastain is working on a new non-fungible token (NFT) platform, Oval, a website and mobile app designed to make it easier for collectors to find NFTs they like.  If successful, the project would mark Chastain’s return to crypto after he resigned from OpenSea in September amid allegations of insider trading.  According to pitch materials viewed by CoinDesk, the new venture is looking to raise a $3 million seed round at a $30 million pre-money valuation as of late February. An earlier version of the deck viewed by CoinDesk showed the project was looking to raise $7.5 million at a $50 million pre-money valuation.  Chastain did not immediately respond to requests for comment via email, Twitter message or Telegram. The most recent pitch deck seen by CoinDesk shows a co-founder who formerly worked for Instagram, according to his LinkedIn profile and the Oval websitehttps://www.oval.xyz/. An email to Oval was not immediately returned.  Since his resignation, Chastain has kept an extremely low profile on social media, seemingly abandoning the Twitter account that bears his infamous blue-bandana CryptoPunk.  He was previously head of product at OpenSea and a senior product manager at the Ethereum wallet MetaMask.  Personalized NFTs?  Oval, described as a “personalized platform for collecting NFTs” in pitch materials, is aiming to save users time in the NFT discovery process by “providing them with more context and control over NFTs than any other consumer platform.”  Currently, the argument goes, the NFT market is oversaturated with projects, making it difficult for collectors to find NFTs about which they might truly care.  Additionally, current discovery processes are time-consuming and inefficient, with collectors frequently hopping from project Discords to marketplace listings to Twitter discussions before finally making a purchase.  Read more: OpenSea Exec Accused of Insider Trading Resigns  The pitch materials compared Oval to Web 2 platforms like YouTube and Spotify, which gained popularity by fine-tuning their recommendation algorithms in order to deliver engaging content to their viewers and listeners.  Similarly, Oval aims to personalize the NFT purchasing experience through alerts, curated galleries, specialized collection interfaces and aggregated activity streams, according to the pitch materials.  While Oval does not appear to be launching a marketplace that would directly compete with Chastain’s former employer, OpenSea, the project indicates smaller NFT platforms are also looking to stake their claim in crypto’s hottest new segment.

42394270,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvapJx,1648760499,What Netflix’s QuadrigaCX Documentary Gets Right – and Wrong – About One of Crypto’s Worst Scandals,"A new Netflix documentary explores the suspicious death of Gerald “Gerry” Cotten and the scandal that ultimately revealed how the Canadian cryptocurrency exchange he founded, QuadrigaCX, had misappropriated customer funds and operated similarly to a Ponzi scheme.  QuadrigaCX is certainly one of the biggest scandals in crypto history. As many as 115,000 customers lost about $190 million worth of various cryptos they kept on the exchange, and the debacle was a black eye for an industry already associated in the public mind with ransomware and dark markets. For seasoned crypto users, the death (or disappearance) of the single executive who controlled the private keys to QuadrigaCX’s wallets offered a stark reminder of the adage, “not your keys, not your coins.”  But is “Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King” worth watching? Two CoinDesk editors watched the film and came away with different conclusions.  ———————————————————————  Toby Bochan, managing editor, Learn:  A large portion of the film focuses on the suspicious death side of the story, rather than on the more interesting story, to me, of how he was able to get away with the scheme for so long and how it was eventually figured out that it wasn’t a case of lost passwords holding customer funds hostage, but rather that there were no funds left to give.  The main theories around Cotten’s death are:  He faked his death as part of an “exit scam” with or without the knowledge of his wife, Jennifer Robertson, changed his appearance and is living the life somewhere in the Bahamas or wherever  Jennifer Robertson poisoned him and is some kind of black widow  He is actually dead.  The Cotten/Quadriga story is inherently interesting to me – which is why I wanted to dig in during my free time enough to write about it before the film came out – but the movie was not. I know that much of the discussion, sleuthing and rumors circulated on Telegram and Reddit. But I felt like 25% of the screen time relied on watching online chats to move the narrative forward and support one of the conspiracy theories around his death. It felt lazy.  The most interesting part of the film to me was the appearance of Jennifer Robertson’s sister, Kimberly Smith, as this is the first time anyone from her family has spoken at length to the media since the scandal. The addition of a point of view from someone who had known Cotten only in a non-business, family way added a layer that I didn’t see in other coverage, as it was clear that Smith at least believed Cotten and Robertson’s relationship and love were genuine.  The downside of spending so much screen time on Robertson is that the film ends up giving equal narrative weight to the black widow theory of Cotten’s death, which I find frankly preposterous. Despite the aspersions the movie casts, there are pretty straightforward reasons why Robertson has had three last names in her life: She was born with one, married into another and changed it to the third after her divorce from her first husband. Her first husband is very much alive, and she hasn’t seemingly benefited financially in any way from Cotten’s death and had to be put in a safe house at one point because of threats from former QuadrigaCX customers.  Theory No. 1 that Cotten faked his death is the dominant one, and the movie could have spent more time on the fake-death industry that is a real thing in India, his history of Ponzi schemes with Michael Patryn aka Omar Denali (aka Sifu), but the filmmakers did a decent job covering these wrinkles in the limited time they had.  Some might say that I am not the right audience for this as I already know how the story turns out. After learning the outline of the story through reporting done on CoinDesk, I listened to Aaron Lammer’s ""Exit Scam"" podcast series and I found it utterly, completely fascinating.  My verdict is: Skip the movie and listen to ""Exit Scam"" instead.  ———————————————————————  Lawrence Lewitinn, managing editor, global capital markets:  If you’ve been closely following the Gerald Cotten/QuadrigaCX saga for the past couple of years, this film leaves a lot to be desired. But for the other 99.98% of people with Netflix subscriptions, it’s a good 90 minutes of entertainment.  Let’s be real here, folks: Nobody besides the kind of people who read CoinDesk religiously knows anything about Quadriga. They may know bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies. They may have a Coinbase account. They may have seen influencers on YouTube peddling some sketchy alts (altcoins). They have heard that hackers use crypto in ransomware. Maybe an oligarch or something has some crypto in Russia he got that way. That’s what they know.  What they don’t know is just how damn sketchy seemingly legitimate exchanges can be.  This film works because it starts viewers off on a path that leads to dead ends and false positives but also gives them a lot to ponder. Is Michael Patryn dodgy? Ask the folks who put money in Wonderland or watch this documentary and see what kind of a past he had. Is Jennifer Robertson, Cotten’s wife (note: I didn’t say “widow”) someone who may know more than she’s letting on? This film explains all the misgivings QuadrigaCX account holders have. Did Cotten really die in India or did he abscond with the money? Or did he just lose everything and disappear rather than own up to his blunder? And how checkered a past did he really have?  We who have been keeping an eye on this case since the previous decade have our theories about it. But try making a documentary about it. It’s not interesting to show text messages and Telegram chats for a couple of hours straight, but the filmmakers managed to keep the story moving with their use of interviews and clips. There has to be something to engage non-crypto viewers. I think this film does a decent job of it.  So maybe you don’t watch it, you know-it-all, but have a normie friend watch it. A real civilian. It’s better than ""Emily in Paris.""",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET,"Toby Leah Bochan, Lawrence Lewitinn",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/31/what-netflixs-quadrigacx-documentary-gets-right-and-wrong-about-one-of-cryptos-worst-scandals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04e0ba99884bb414bd29336bc7c0677bbe03044c-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Several large banks are exploring making markets for clients in bitcoin (BTC) futures, with an eye towards trading forward [contracts] and other derivatives,” said Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), in a virtual speech during an American Bankers Association conference on Thursday. “Before banks move too much farther down this path, they should carefully consider the tail risks of trading crypto derivatives.""  Hsu cited Goldman Sachs (GS) completing its first cryptocurrency-related, over-the-counter (OTC) trade with Galaxy Digital last week. The Wall Street giant and the digital-asset financial firm said the transaction demonstrates the ""continued maturation and adoption of digital assets by banking institutions.""  Hsu warned that crypto pricing is ""limited or unreliable,"" so the type of models big lenders typically use to figure out risk could make them underestimate what they're facing. Hsu contends banks could end up without a big enough capital cushion.  He also wondered whether the lenders his agency oversees can properly hedge their risks if those hazards can't be measured.  Hsu said he's working with other global regulators to find ""a consistent, careful and cautious approach to bank involvement in crypto.""

42422862,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qUFh,1648758174,Market Wrap: Cryptos Slide Amid Higher Volatility; Returns Typically Strong in April,"Most cryptocurrencies traded lower on Thursday, indicating a pause in bullish sentiment.  Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $47,000, although technicals suggest support around $43,000 could stabilize the pullback. The cryptocurrency also saw a strong uptick in short-term volatility over the past 24 hours, similar to what occurred during bitcoin's breakout above $45,000 last week, according to data provided by Skew.  Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why. Coming April 4.  On Thursday, European Union lawmakers voted in favor of controversial measures to outlaw anonymous crypto transactions. The proposals are intended to extend anti-money laundering (AML) requirements that apply to conventional payments over EUR 1,000 ($1,114) to the crypto sector. BTC fell by 2% within minutes as the vote came through.  Meanwhile, alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) underperformed on Thursday, suggesting a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders. For example, ether (ETH) declined by as much as 4% over the past 24 hours, and AAVE lost as much as 9%, compared with a 3% dip in BTC over the same period.  The S&P 500 was also lower on Thursday and snapped a four-day winning streak. Traditional safe havens such as gold and the U.S. dollar rose, while the 10-year Treasury yield continued to decline from Tuesday's high of 2.5%.  Still, current pullbacks across speculative assets could be limited. Historical data suggests further upside in April and May, albeit with greater volatility because of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical risks.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $45,558, −3.13%    ●Ether (ETH): $3,286, −3.25%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,530, −1.56%    ●Gold: $1,942 per troy ounce, +0.41%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.33%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Adding bitcoin to the mix  Bitcoin is outperforming the S&P 500 so far this year, albeit with higher volatility.  On a risk-adjusted return basis, however, bitcoin is slightly below the S&P 500 over the past 30 days, according to data from IntoTheBlock. Generally, over time, crypto investors are compensated for higher volatility in the form of higher returns versus traditional equities.  For some investors, diversification has been challenging over the past few months because of bitcoin's rising correlation with stocks. Further, negative returns in Treasury bonds and stocks contributed to a lower appetite for risk among global investors.  Still, gold and other commodities outperformed over the past three months, which is typical during times of rising volatility and higher inflation.  Altcoins in the lead  The chart below shows returns across the CoinDesk 20 in March. The CoinDesk 20 filters from the larger universe of thousands of cryptocurrencies and digital assets by trading volume and market capitalization.  ETC, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum Classic, a blockchain project that was created in 2016 when Ethereum’s blockchain split into two separate chains, posted the highest return in the CoinDesk 20 in March. Meanwhile, ETH was up 15% in March, compared with a 9% gain in BTC over the same period.  Typically, altcoins outperform in a rising market because of their higher risk profile relative to BTC.  Seasonal strength in April and May  So far, bitcoin's positive return in March is well ahead of its seasonal norm. On average, March is typically a weak month for BTC, albeit with a low probability. Instead, April and May have a strong probability of positive returns.  The chart below shows bitcoin's average historical returns alongside the percentage of times when BTC produced a positive return by month.

42374947,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4de3,1648757406,"I’m Not Anti-Crypto, Says Architect of Controversial EU Money Laundering Proposal","“Bitcoin is cool,” a leading European Union lawmaker told CoinDesk on the day she successfully shepherded out of committee a controversial new proposal some in the industry warn could harm privacy and innovation.  In an exclusive interview, Belgium’s Assita Kanko said she hoped her legislation would bring crypto into the mainstream – but admitted to being “shocked” at some of the reactions to her proposal.  Kanko's proposal, part of a package of anti-money laundering (AML) legislation voted through by lawmakers Thursday, would require all crypto transactions to identify the participants, just as large bank transfers do. Controversially, it would also include payments made using privately managed unhosted wallets.  The EU's Council, which is composed of national ministers from EU member nations, will meet the parliament to discuss the provision. In order for Kanko's law to take effect, both the Council and Parliament must agree on the language as written.  The legislation has been condemned by major industry players including crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), by lawyers who say undue invasions of privacy could be struck down by EU courts and by rival EU lawmakers who say the AML measure could hamper Europe's competitiveness because it seeks to discourage blockchain innovation.  Bitcoin (BTC) is “really cool, but I don't think crime is cool,” Kanko said. “Crypto deserves a better reputation.”  On Wednesday, Fabio Panetta, a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, called for less tolerance of cryptocurrencies, which he likened to gambling. Kanko doesn’t appear to agree with that tough line.  “I am more nuanced,” she said. “I don't think that bitcoin is necessarily bad. But I think that people use bitcoin to do bad things.”  She says she “admires” the innovative mindset of people active in the market – and even cites members of her own family who follow it. But equally, she said, some misuse anonymous payments to finance crimes, citing drugs, prostitution, child pornography and terrorism.  Kanko said she understood those who have legitimate reasons for not wanting the government to snoop into every small purchase they make.  “I totally understand,” she said. “It's my role as a politician, as a lawmaker, to listen to people, understand the legitimate concerns and take that into account when we make laws.""  But she denies claims, such as from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in a recent tweet, that the legislation constitutes a “crypto surveillance regime,” and is “anti-innovation, anti-privacy and anti-law enforcement.”  “The law is embedded in the existing laws, and your rights will be respected,” she said, citing the bloc’s tough law on data protection, known as the GDPR. “When there is more trust … it will also benefit the crypto world and give more space for innovation.”  The package of proposals is intended to extend anti-money laundering requirements that apply to conventional payments over EUR 1,000 (US$1,114) to the crypto sector. They also mandate that payers and recipients of even the smallest crypto transactions would need to be identified, including for transactions with unhosted or self-hosted wallets. Further measures under discussion could see unregulated crypto exchanges cut off from the conventional financial system.  Kanko said she’s happy to get feedback and talk to the crypto community. She was enthused by a lively debate she took part in Wednesday in the Belgian town of Leuven, just a few miles from the European Parliament's seat in Brussels, where she describes crypto enthusiasts as warm, charming and intelligent.  But she said she was “shocked” by some of the online reaction she got as her proposal neared finalization. She said the reaction was aggressive.  “It’s not constructive,” she said. “If you really want your point to be taken into account, just go to the lawmakers and speak with them. ... [B]ut if you insult me and threaten me, it is not going to help your case.”  Read more: EU Parliament Passes Privacy-Busting Crypto Rules Despite Industry Criticism  Her arguments are likely to hold little sway with crypto supporters such as lobbying group Blockchain for Europe, which, shortly after our interview, warned Kanko’s measures threaten the future of the EU’s crypto industry.  The European Parliament’s approach “will lead to insufficient consumer protection, huge privacy concerns, a reduction of Europe’s competitiveness and a missed opportunity for better law enforcement at European level,” the lobby group said in a press release, calling for a move towards the more lax approach to unhosted wallets favored by the EU’s national finance ministers.  Kanko does not expect to win over everyone.  “In a law you can only reach the best possible balance,” she said. “You cannot have something that pleases everyone.”  Read more: Crypto Privacy Positions Harden Ahead of Crunch EU Vote",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/31/im-not-anti-crypto-says-architect-of-controversial-eu-money-laundering-proposal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cd6ce92ecc08951a4789f72e646bf10ba562ab6-960x1280.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The city on Tuesday published a whitepaper with the proposal for the platform, which will be operational between the last quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of next year, Diego Fernández, secretary of innovation and digital transformation of Buenos Aires, told CoinDesk.  The platform will be decentralized, public and non-permissioned, said Fernandez, adding that it will be available for use by any organization, government administration or company wishing to mint verifiable identities, without needing the approval of the city.  “[The motivation is] to give rise to a new paradigm in which secure transactions are agile; where verification of necessary documentation is fast, reliable and private … that people are in control of their identity, and they decide where their information is stored and who can access it,"" the whitepaper stated.  In the next 90 days, the city will define the architecture of the platform and decide what blockchain it will be built on. After that, Fernández said, it will take about six months to develop the platform.  ""There are a lot of very relevant architectural decisions to be made in the face of preserving privacy and allowing it to be a non-permissioned public network,” he said, adding that the platform should be able to connect with different blockchains in the future.  Among those involved in the project so far are Santiago Siri, a contributor to the Proof of Humanity project and developer of the Universal Basic Income (UBI) ERC-20 token; Leo Elduayen, CEO and co-founder of Koibanx, a Latin American asset tokenization and blockchain financial infrastructure company; and Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, founder and CEO of RSK Labs, which operates a smart contract blockchain secured by the Bitcoin network.

This revolution will be brought about by the convergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), 5G technology, and edge computing. Welcome to Web 3.0, the latest iteration of internet services and the next stage in the evolution of the world wide web. This redesign of the internet is also known as the &apos;Semantic Web,&apos; and it is expected to change how people work, communicate, interact, and collaborate. In this emerging space, data will be held in decentralized networks powered by blockchain technology, thus allowing Web 3.0 to become fully trustless and permissionless. As such, the opportunities that may become available with the adoption of Web 3.0 are almost limitless. The technology has the potential to transform the traditional financial space, including capital markets, asset management, insurance, and banking. In this short guide, we will take a look at some of the reasons that will make Web 3.0 indispensable to financial institutions, especially banks, in the near future. Web 3.0 Will Help Banks Know their Customers Better The new internet will be anchored by artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The bitcoin was trading at $45,945 as of press time, down 2.5% on the day. The latest price drop followed an eight-day winning streak that had brought bitcoin to a break-even point for the year, recovering from this year's abysmal start.  “Bullish bitcoin momentum has definitely run out of steam, and the persistent geopolitical risk will likely cap the recent rally,” said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda. “Bitcoin seems poised to consolidate here and could be vulnerable to a drop towards the $44,500 level.”  Although bitcoin adoption is improving and interest is growing, it takes time to drive steady long-term flows, Moya said. “The path higher will be a slower grind higher for bitcoin as many traders will also focus on the other coins that are earlier in their growth stage,” he said.  According to Jason Deane, chief bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics, this consolidation is positive for the market because it builds a new base for investors to “make further price discovery.”  On Tuesday, a unit of MicroStrategy, a software company holds a large amount of bitcoin in its treasury, said it obtained a $205 million loan collateralized by bitcoin.  Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a nonprofit that supports decentralized networks, also resumed buying bitcoin. It announced a $272 million purchase on Wednesday.

It is high-risk and requires no expertise compared to investing in traditional assets. This comparison conveys an unfair and negative connotation laced with economic bigotry.

42411815,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgD8o,1648752653,How to Buy a House With Crypto: US Edition,"Today, more than one-third of small businesses reportedly accept crypto payments, and some speculate that crypto mortgage payments are going to be more common in the coming years.  Fintech platforms such as BitPay, BTCPay, CoinBase Commerce and OpenNode are making it easier to transfer crypto peer-to-peer and even between consumers and businesses, and some mortgage lenders have already begun to experiment with giving consumers the option to pay in crypto.  For instance, United Wholesale Mortgage, the nation’s second-largest mortgage lender, unveiled a short-lived plan last August to start accepting bitcoin payments, but quickly scrapped the program, citing the high costs and regulatory uncertainty.  Yet the thought of buying a house with crypto may be too enticing for developers and innovators to simply give up. While it’s not yet fully normalized, there are still ways you can legally buy a home with bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH) and other crypto assets in the United States – whether through a financial institution or simply as a private transaction between two consumers.  How to buy a house using crypto  For the savvy crypto natives and crypto-curious homebuyers, here are some options that presently exist.  Use your crypto as collateral  One way to leverage your crypto for real estate is to use it as a down payment. A number of new fintech platforms are rolling out products for this very purpose. Crypto lenders like BlockFi, Celsius and Unchained Capital offer crypto-backed loans with annual percentage rates ranging from 1% to 6%. The loans can be used for major purchases of things like autos and real estate.  These companies claim to help everyone from the unbanked to high-net-worth individuals expand their lending options by leveraging crypto assets.  The concept of a crypto-collateralized loan is intriguing in that borrowers don’t have to liquidate their crypto holdings in order to access financing. This prevents the need to cash out your crypto and avoids creating a taxable event in order to buy a house.  The tricky parts about crypto-collateralized loans are that: (A) they aren’t available in all states yet, and (B) it’s hard to determine the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio because cryptocurrencies are highly volatile.  Assuming you get a loan at a 1:1 ratio and use 1 BTC for collateral, you could theoretically get a loan for the market price of $47,500 (the value of BTC at the time of writing). Each lender will have a different LTV equation.  Just remember: Unless you are using a stablecoin such as USDC or USDT, the value of the cryptocurrency backing the loan will likely swing wildly in price. That volatility could affect your LTV in two ways:  If bitcoin’s price leaps to $100,000, you now have an extra $66,000 worth of bitcoin that you could tap into without having to touch your home’s equity.  A drop in prices could alter the LTV negatively, which could trigger something called a margin call. If a margin call was triggered, the lender would require you to deposit more crypto to bring the LTV back to the original level.  That said, there’s some argument that as you build equity in the home, the real estate value will eventually become a large enough part of the collateral to help neutralize or even out the crypto down payment, even if the value of your original collateral drops. The value of real estate, however, rises at a much slower pace than a mooning crypto, and so you could also stand to lose money in the short term. This dynamic illustrates both the risk and potential benefits associated with a crypto-backed loan.  Direct crypto transfer from buyer to seller  There’s nothing stopping two individuals from creating a private agreement to sell a home in exchange for crypto using a direct wallet-to-wallet transfer. It’s probably wise to get your agreement in writing and talk to a lawyer who is familiar with both real estate law and crypto.  This method probably isn’t going to fly if you use a real estate agent, who likely isn’t prepared to receive a commission in the form of crypto. Not to mention that the traditional escrow process will need to go through an accredited bank.  Using NFTs to buy a house  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are most familiar as a way to own digital art collectibles. But the digitally coded records known as smart contracts that result when NFTs are minted open up new possibilities for both real estate deeds and payment.  An NFT can both represent the “normal” sale of a piece of real estate and act as a form of payment or collateral or both if the owner or financing institution accepts its value.  A recent Florida house sale demonstrates the first process: In May, the real estate startup Propy sold its first NFT-backed property in the U.S. In the experimental transaction, the owner purchased a 2,000-square-foot house for 210 ETH ($653,000) and received an NFT as proof of ownership. Some industry professionals argue that NFTs are superior records to paper deeds, which can get lost and create ambiguity about a property’s value, size, taxes, sale history and other details. With smart contracts, these specifics will theoretically remain well-documented on a blockchain, where they will live forever.  NFT-backed home sales, however, aren't the norm, as the logistics are still new. In the case above, the NFT had to be linked to an limited-liability company (LLC), which actually owns the physical property and against which consumers can borrow. This adds an extra step in the process that most consumers aren't used to. There’s also the question of how an NFT can be accurately valued when used as collateral. Crypto lending protocol Helio, which is working with Propy, advertises no-margin-call loans if the value of your crypto or NFT goes down. However, you will want to make sure the details are clear and in writing.  Cashing out your crypto  Just as you can pay for a house with crypto in a for-sale-by-owner situation, you can also pay in cash just as easily.  Likewise, if you need cash for financing, you can cash out a portion of your crypto holdings to put toward the initial down payment.  Why buy a house with a decentralized asset?  Before you choose one of the above options and move ahead with your real estate purchase, consider why you would want to buy a house with crypto in the first place.  Crypto was created to be a decentralized asset, while the mortgage industry is built upon a structure of lenders and financing – aka centralized banks. It’s a little odd to consider taking out a mortgage from a bank and then use a novel, permissionless and fully decentralized algorithmic currency to pay back the fiat (government) currency that you borrowed in order to buy a physical asset in the real world.  Nonetheless, there are several arguments for trading your digital assets for a physical one. At its core, doing so is a type of arbitrage that helps you blend your portfolio with more kinds of assets. That is, it helps you diversify. Buying a house with crypto is essentially trading a volatile asset for a much more predictable one that historically has appreciated. This may be particularly appealing if you find yourself in a situation where you have more dispensable crypto than fiat currency and want to leverage some of it to buy real estate. Those who bought bitcoin back in 2010, for instance, and are now relishing the fruits of the 2021 euphoric bull market may be in this boat. Early crypto adopters may now find that they now have millions of dollars' worth of digital assets and feel OK about allocating a percentage of that toward a house or land.  Just remember to factor in capital gains if you plan to cash out your crypto for U.S. dollars, or even if you exchange it to another type of crypto in the process of buying your home.  When you cash out your crypto holdings, make sure to note the price point at which you sold your assets and whether you made a profit or loss from the sale. You will need that information to report capital gains or losses when you do your taxes.

42394262,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaoev,1648751442,Vitalik Buterin on Ethereum's 'Roads Not Taken',"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a blog post this week reflecting on the possible directions his creation could have taken. The piece, titled, ""The roads not taken,"" is technical in places, but the main conclusions are easy to grasp.  Ethereum today has resulted from previous choices, decisions that were constrained by resources and “brain cycles” and implementations where sometimes it was worth waiting for perfect and other times when good enough sufficed.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Ethereum could have been less complex, Buterin writes. Its virtual machine could have used existing code rather than a bespoke solution. Its developers could have gone with a crude version of proof-of-stake (the consensus algorithm that will eventually secure Ethereum) that existed in 2013. Ethereum could have been “more Bitcoin-like,” Buterin said, referencing that first blockchain, which aims to do one thing well – serve as a global, peer-to-peer settlements layer denominated in a secure, digital bearer-asset, BTC.  “In general, it sometimes feels to me like Ethereum's biggest challenges come from balancing between two visions – a pure and simple blockchain that values safety and simplicity, and a highly performant and functional platform for building advanced applications,” Buterin wrote.  Ethereum initially wanted to become the “world computer,” or a decentralized platform, powered by cryptocurrency to execute any conceivable application. Today, Ethereum supports a multibillion-dollar economy, attracts some of the world’s smartest computer scientists and is the wellspring from which a number of novel computer “primitives” surface.  This balancing act between elegant design and complexity is complicated by Ethereum’s being an open network. It exists so anyone with an idea and sufficient capital can build their dream applications or chase a quick buck.  Ethereum is often criticized within the crypto industry, especially by bitcoiners, for its hierarchy of developers. There are certainly people and organizations with sway over Ethereum, but the network is arguably democratic. Or, at the very least, its oligopoly exists in the open.  When Buterin speaks, people listen. Earlier this month, Time magazine ran a cover story about Buterin, where he suggested he would take a more defined leadership role going forward. “One of the decisions I made in 2022 is to try to be more risk-taking and less neutral,” Buterin said. “I would rather Ethereum offend some people than turn into something that stands for nothing.”  He’s long been critical of the many ways people abuse his machine. In 2017, he asked if the network had earned its $1 billion valuation (largely propelled by the speculative initial coin offering boom).  He is likewise skeptical now of the many decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), in which the presence of venture capitalists and self-interested actors has become the “de facto standard,” and where token-voting becomes a stand-in for plutocracy.  Some of this is the natural outcome of Ethereum “premine,” which Buterin fairly categorized as “not credibly neutral” in his recent blog. About 12 million ETH (about 10% of the total supply today) was distributed to the Ethereum Foundation and about “~100 early [protocol] contributors,'' he wrote, adding that “a few recipient addresses were hand-picked through a closed process,” and that “the premine over-rewarded very early contributors, and left too little for later contributors.”  See also: Women-Led DAO Tackles (Lack of) Gender Diversity in Crypto  Although the Ethereum Foundation was quickly forced to sell the majority of its stake to pay for early, continued development, the process has colored all of Ethereum’s history to date.  A revisionist view may have preferred that the ETH distribution event was managed by a DAO or kept more to pay for later development. Buterin considers both but is comfortable accepting history as it unfolded. There are some that may never accept Ethereum because of its checkered history and because of what it used for today.  All too often in the world of software, losing sight of a machine (even a virtual one’s) material circumstances is easy. But these systems, world changing as they may be, still exist.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/31/vitalik-buterin-on-ethereums-roads-not-taken,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f523c4a347a324eefc1c80b2556b65c6bdf2c9e-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374950,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4dhp,1648748485,CFTC Chief Says FTX Plan Could Make Crypto Markets 'More Efficient',"Crypto exchange FTX.US’ effort to win government approval to directly clear its customers’ derivatives trades needs an answer because it won’t be the last proposal of its kind, the chief of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday.  “There will be more in the future,” CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said during a hearing of the House Agriculture Committee, which oversees his agency. He said the proposal from FTX.US Derivatives – though novel – is a logical outcome of the new technology to “break down some of these silos and have more direct access,” though he said he hasn’t decided whether to support it.  “This proposal could end up leading to more efficient trading execution, less risk in the system,” Behnam said, adding that he’s required to cultivate “responsible innovation,” and the idea isn’t necessarily prohibited or in violation of commodities laws. Still, he considered the question worth a significant ongoing public-comment period. “As we are considering and contemplating the FTX proposal, we're doing it cautiously,” he said.  FTX had applied to allow its trading platform to directly clear derivatives that are backed by margin, and FTX.US President Brett Harrison argued earlier this month that “large amounts of time between margining periods causes risk to build up in the system, resulting in market swings,” and this change would address that problem.  Harrison, whose company hired former CFTC commissioner and acting chair Mark Wetjen to shepherd its regulatory goals, said an approval from the CFTC would set up FTX as “the first crypto-native exchange that is able offer margined crypto derivatives in an integrated platform with a cryptocurrency spot exchange.”  However, the committee’s Democratic chairman was suspicious of the plan.  “This needs far more review,” said Rep. David Scott, calling the FTX idea “unproven and untested.” He said he’s “very concerned about this.”  After the CFTC’s 60-day comment period that ends May 11, Behnam said his staff will plan for a roundtable on non-intermediated market structure later that month. The agency will also then have a full slate of commissioners, after the Senate this week confirmed four nominees to fill gaps in the shorthanded agency.  The CFTC could eventually decide to make tweaks to the FTX idea based on the agency’s internal review and outside input, and then it would be up to the company to decide whether it can live with those changes. Behnam said he doubted an FTX approval would require changes to existing commodities rules.  Meanwhile, the agency chief argued that it’s increasingly important for this “largely unregulated market” to put a definition to what makes a digital commodity. He said that definition should come from the CFTC.  Behnam, installed as chairman by President Joe Biden, also seized a chance during questioning to warn lawmakers that the agency needs more money to deal with its rapidly increasing responsibilities – including over crypto assets.  “I do think we will need an increased budget to deal with all of these issues in the digital assets space,” Behnam said.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/31/cftc-chief-says-ftx-plan-could-make-crypto-markets-more-efficient,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02d1e07fefd7fb0401d44aef3a6633cc35bd902d-5000x3333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374955,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4dlb,1648748091,Bitcoin's March Gains Help Erase Memories (and Losses) From Awful 2022 Start,"Bitcoin, after suffering one of its worst-ever starts to a year, came back strong in March with a 9% gain, almost completely reversing losses from earlier in 2022 and outperforming U.S. stocks while leading a rally across broader digital-asset markets.  Alternative cryptocurrencies known as altcoins also boasted gains, and some even outperformed bitcoin, with ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, pushing a 15% increase.  Michael Safai, managing partner at Dexterity Capital, a trading firm focused on digital assets, noted that the volatility driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty at the start of March began to stabilize during the month,  Bitcoin dipped to lows of $37,000 in early March, but has made a recovery over the last two weeks, rallying to above $48,000. Ethereum traded in a range of $2,445 to $3,472 in March.  “Tokens were freed again to move based on their merit, rather than the risk-off attitude that tends to push all coins in the same direction,” Safai said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Because altcoins often trade in sync with bitcoin, BTC’s rally in March has perhaps helped push up a diversified range of crypto assets. Among the top 10 coins with a market values above $1 billion, Solana, Terra and Cardano boasted 27% monthly gains. Avalanche’s AVAX, meanwhile, was up 15% in March.  Contributing to Solana's and Cardano’s performances in March was the growing mainstream curiosity about the launch of Ethereum 2.0, which has encouraged traders to move back into layer 1 tokens, according to Safai. He said that although markets got thrown off in February by the war in Ukraine, coins from layer 1 networks have had momentum behind them for some months.  “As things settled in March, these coins stood their ground because of their fundamentals (AVAX as well). But they got an extra pop from all the ETH 2.0 buzz as well,” Safai said.  FTM – the token of layer 1 blockchain Fantom, which has a market capitalization of $3.7 billion – hasn't performed well in March. It is down 22% on the month and has had a drop in price for the last three months.  In October, Fantom rose 137% and reached its all-time high of $3.47. The token is now trading at $1.47.  “Fantom is making progress, but it is not as far along as some of the other layer 1s,” Safai said, explaining that traders might be playing it safe and pouring money into bigger proof-of-stake chains.  “This could change if risk appetites continue to increase, which would help Fantom,” he said.  Gavin Smith, CEO of Panxora, a crypto exchange and advisory firm, said that “as March has been broadly positive for crypto, Fantom has been a noticeable outlier because of the departure of two key players in the Fantom DeFi (decentralized finance) ecosystem.” He expects Fantom to outperform the general market as it recovers some of the event-driven losses.  “Fantom started March strong, but a combination of DeFi developer Andre Cronje departing the industry, combined with a rotation of funds to established layer 1 blockchains, hit Fantom hard,” said Jai Bifulco, chief commercial officer of Kinesis Money.  “The change in narrative likely saw money rotate from the Fantom ecosystem into assets that were lagging behind in growth, like Solana and Cardano, as traders and investors seek greater returns,” Bifulco said.  Looking forward to April, Safai predicts that sentiment will remain ""cautiously positive.""  “The healthiest sign is that volumes are starting to edge back towards the levels we saw in late December,"" Safai said. ""This volatility is predictable, healthy and offering some great opportunities for traders that can get in and out quickly.”  According to a report from Finbold, CoinMarketCap predicts that bitcoin will trade above $51,000 by the end of April.  Additional altcoins that have taken a hit this month include Decentraland’s MANA token and Cosmo’s ATOM, which were both down 5%.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ADA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/31/bitcoins-march-gains-help-erase-memories-and-losses-from-awful-2022-start,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/57f64c16c495e9fe049400c66123ff0a5a346765-1222x764.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In its guidance, the SEC said the custody of digital assets on behalf of others has risks not present with other assets:  Technological risks – There are risks with respect to both safeguarding of assets and rapidly-changing crypto-assets in the market that are not present with other arrangements to safeguard assets for third parties.  Legal risks – Due to the unique characteristics of the assets and the lack of legal precedent, there are significant legal questions surrounding how such arrangements would be treated in a court proceeding arising from an adverse event (e.g., fraud, loss, theft, or bankruptcy).  Regulatory risks – As compared to many common arrangements to safeguard assets for third parties, there are significantly fewer regulatory requirements for holding crypto-assets for platform users, or entities may not be complying with regulatory requirements that do apply, which results in increased risks to investors in these entities.  These risks can have a ""significant impact"" on the custodian's operations and financial conditions, the SEC guidance said.

42394266,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaozR,1648744206,"Crypto Should Disrupt Current Anti-Money Laundering Practices, Not Adopt Them","Until the early 20th century, highly respected doctors would routinely engage in bloodletting to cure ailments ranging from acne to tuberculosis. While we have left bloodletting behind, we are still engaging in putatively helpful, but veritably destructive practices.  Modern know-your-customer/anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) regulations are equivalent to financial bloodletting today: They do little good and may cause a lot of harm. Yet whether we like it or not, the KYC/AML nightmare is coming to crypto.  A few weeks ago, news broke that a consortium of U.S.-based crypto companies had formed TRUST, a travel rule compliance platform that expands financial surveillance.  Incorporated companies must abide by the law of their local jurisdiction. Yet crypto shouldn’t blindly follow legacy AML rules from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global money-laundering and terrorist funding oversight group; it should disrupt them.  A recent phenomenon  The idea of money laundering is a relatively recent one. In 1970, Richard Nixon passed the euphemistically named Bank Secrecy Act, which required financial institutions to spy on their customers.  Keep in mind, Al Capone and other U.S. mobsters had already been successfully prosecuted for tax evasion 40 years before the Bank Secrecy Act was passed! Since then, the scope of surveillance has grown exponentially. For example, banks in 1970 were required to report transactions in excess of $10,000. Today the limit remains $10,000, but $10,000 in 1970 is equivalent to $73,000 today!  Only after the 1990s did the rest of the world criminalize “money laundering,” mostly because of U.S. pressure after the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Washington, D.C.  What have the results been of this policy experiment?  According to financial crime specialist Dr. Ron Pol, very little. Current AML rules don’t stop the vast majority of money laundering. The United Nations estimates that less than 1% of all criminal assets are seized globally, meaning that over 99% of criminal assets get laundered with impunity.  Why would criminals use the relatively small cryptocurrency market to launder funds on a public record, when they can easily launder billions through the conventional financial system without a trace?  AML regulations also come at a great financial cost. Worldwide spending on AML and sanctions compliance by financial institutions is estimated to exceed $180 billion a year, about 100 times more than the $1 billion to $2 billion in criminal assets that get seized annually.  Social costs are also high. The bureaucratic rules designed to keep criminals out disenfranchise millions of legitimate customers. More often than not, these are often marginalized groups.  If you live in a small or poor country, you might find it impossible to jump through the arbitrary hoops designed by a San Francisco product manager on the advice of a London lawyer. The author has personally been locked out of accounts because a small EU government issued document was not accepted as valid proof of address. The company’s KYC service couldn’t comprehend that there are places where people do not use utility bills to prove residence.  AML departments in financial service companies are more about complying with AML legislation than actually stopping money laundering. A 2014 study found that identity verification “principles, guidance and practices resulted in processes that are largely bureaucratic and do not ensure that identity fraud is effectively prevented.”  In other words, fraud has been growing at astronomical rates worldwide and KYC laws have greatly contributed to this. People are now accustomed to share their personal identity documents with a wide range of actors ranging from banks to telecom providers to pornography websites. Is it surprising when their information gets compromised?  Crypto is well suited  How can cryptocurrency disrupt AML regulations? Cryptography-based systems are uniquely well suited for proving identity and source of funds. Moreover, they can do so in a privacy preserving and transparent way. For instance, you could open accounts at a centralized entity pseudonymously, using a public key verified by a trusted authority.  That way you have to trust only one entity with your details. A similar privacy-preserving method could be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) using zero-knowledge proofs. Indeed, there is evidence that crypto is starting to disrupt sanctions enforcement.  Coinbase announced it had limited access to its services in 25,000 wallets that may be related to sanctioned Russians. The non-custodial privacy-focused wallet Wasabi has announced it will be blocking sanctioned addresses from its CoinJoin pools, meaning that users can be confident they won’t be mixing funds with sanctioned individuals. These measures, while countering the censorship-resistant ethos of cryptocurrency, generate much less collateral damage than the blanket bans and creeping surveillance of the current regime.  Although medical bloodletting was probably well intentioned, over centuries it caused a lot of unnecessary suffering, came at great societal cost and did nothing to treat disease. The cryptocurrency industry was born from a realization that the modern financial system leaves individuals vulnerable to abuse by trusted third parties.  The current regulatory hodgepodge of FATF-driven KYC and AML regulations have birthed ineffective systems that do little to stop money laundering. Instead, they enable political censorship, financial surveillance, fraud and inequality. The cryptocurrency industry should lead by example through the use of new innovative and effective anti-crime methods, instead of forcing old, ineffective ones.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Boaz Sobrado,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/31/crypto-should-disrupt-current-anti-money-laundering-practices-not-adopt-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8abc23310958366b2235f720d4f80921aaa562e-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The attack targeted Fuse Lending, which attempted to use Ola’s lending-as-a-service protocol with incompatible token standards.  According to PeckShield, a blockchain security firm that worked with Ola to diagnose the exploit, the attacker took advantage of a so-called “re-entrancy” bug in one of Ola’s smart contracts.  The attack comes after this week’s disclosure of a $625 million exploit of Axie Infinity’s Ronin network – one of the largest in decentralized finance (DeFi) history. While much smaller in comparison, the Ola attack stands as a reminder of how multimillion-dollar thefts – now commonplace in DeFi – continue to pile up as big money flows into lesser-known ecosystems.  Ola’s DeFi protocol operates across several blockchains, and Thursday’s attack targeted its deployment on the Fuse network – an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchain with a mere $12.8 million in total value locked (TVL) prior to the attack, according to data compiled by DefiLlama.  The attacker began by withdrawing funds using Tornado Cash, which enables users to transfer crypto without leaving a trace. After transferring the funds to the Fuse network, the borrower used them as collateral to take out loans on Ola’s decentralized lending platform. Taking advantage of the re-entrancy bug, the attacker was then able to remove the collateral without first paying back the loan.  The hacker repeated this process several times across different Ola pools. They then transferred the drained funds to wallets on Ethereum and BNB Chain.  Ola has paused the use of its lending protocol on Fuse network and tweeted that it will soon publish an “official report detailing the exploit.” The project says its services on other blockchains were unaffected by the exploit and will remain operational.  This is not the first, nor the largest re-entrancy attack in recent memory.  Little more than two weeks before the Ola attack, two lending protocols on the Gnosis blockchain suffered similar exploits. The DAO attack in 2016, an infamous exploit that led to an Ethereum hard fork, was also a version of a re-entrancy attack.

42420977,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAoqz,1648738968,The UK Wants to Regulate Crypto: Here's What That Could Look Like,"The United Kingdom is set to create a broad regulatory framework detailing how cryptocurrency businesses can set up shop and operate in the country.  The U.K. Treasury is due to unveil a package for regulating crypto in the coming weeks. Many in the crypto community welcome such a plan, hoping the U.K. will take a similar approach to what the U.S. and European Union have done.  CNBC first reported the U.K.'s plan to regulate crypto earlier this week.  ""Of course reducing financial risk for crypto holders is important, but we hope it does not become over-regulated,” Humayun Sheikh, CEO of artificial intelligence platform Fetch.ai, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “We look forward to how the regulations plan to address the current opportunities and challenges.""  The U.K. is the latest jurisdiction to speed up efforts to regulate the industry in a comprehensive way in the face of the rising adoption of cryptocurrencies.  The country is a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) spot in Europe in terms of adoption. Crypto investors poured $170 billion into DeFi platforms between June 2020 and July 2021, the most in Europe during that period, according to a Chainalysis report.  The EU approach  In February, the Treasury released a report saying that the U.K. needed to “act quickly” to preserve its position as a crypto hub by having a new framework to regulate crypto.  The report said that the framework should be similar to the European Union’s (EU) Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) package that is making its way through the bloc’s legislative process. The report also said that the Treasury’s regulatory framework should be a functional and technology-neutral approach that would be in line with current regulations and that would factor in crypto risks.  “MiCA negotiations may be finished by the middle of 2022, meaning the U.K. must quickly choose how closely it replicates or diverges from MiCA,” Nicholas du Cros, head of compliance and regulatory affairs at CoinShares, a leading digital asset management firm in Europe, said in an email to CoinDesk.  The MiCA bill, which is meant to be applicable to all 27 EU nations, has a heavy focus on stablecoins.  MiCA defines three subcategories of crypto assets, including the following: asset-referenced tokens, which are stablecoins like Facebook’s now-canceled project Libra that were designed to be backed by a basket of currencies; e-money tokens, which are stablecoins pegged to a fiat currency; and utility tokens, which are intended to provide access to a good or service and are accepted only by their issuers.  Issuers of those kinds of cryptos in the EU must, in the future, publish a white paper.  Meanwhile, firms that provide any service related to the defined crypto assets must obtain approval from regulatory authorities in an EU country. Once they have approval from one local authority and are in accordance with the EU regulations, they can operate anywhere in the EU.  MiCA doesn’t apply to digital currencies issued by central banks or security tokens like securities, deposits, treasury bills or derivatives.  Read more: Europe’s MiCA Crypto Rules Are Coming Soon. Here’s Why They Matter  According to CNBC, the U.K. crypto regulations would likely focus on stablecoins, something the government has been consulting on since the Treasury’s March 2020 budget prioritized the issue.  “Measures are likely to include prior authorization for issuers to operate, capital and liquidity requirements as well as auditing and accounting requirements including the obligation to have sufficient reserves held in high-quality liquid assets,” Ryan Shea, a crypto economist at Trakx, a U.K.-based digital-assets company, said in an email to CoinDesk.  “These additional requirements, on top of standard KYC/AML requirements, increase the regulatory burden and will naturally favor larger crypto firms who have the infrastructure and financial resources to satisfy these demands,” Shea said, referring to know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering requirements.  The U.S. approach  A parallel can be drawn with U.S. President Joe Biden’s recent executive order, du Cross said. In early March, Biden encouraged federal agencies to coordinate their approach to the crypto sector.  The U.K. already set up a joint crypto asset task force in 2018 that consisted of senior representatives from top U.K. regulators, including the Bank of England, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Treasury.  What the U.K. has done so far  The U.K. doesn’t consider crypto as a currency or commodity, and has been regulating the crypto industry in different ways.  The FCA became the U.K.'s regulator for anti-money laundering and countering financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) in 2020, and more than 100 firms have registered to be supervised by the regulator since then. Firms waiting for approval by the FCA were put on its “Temporary Registration Regime” (TRR), which enabled them to do business until April 1.  A small number of firms will be allowed to have temporary registration, beyond that date, the FCA said.  Read more: Crypto Firms Weigh Options as UK Registration Deadline Looms  The FCA also announced in 2018 that cryptocurrency derivatives are capable of being financial instruments under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MIFID II) and must comply with the regulator's rules for such products.  In 2019, it also published its “Guidance on Crypto Assets,” which set out three other ways crypto could be regulated. Crypto regarded as utility tokens that grant access to prospective products or services in the U.K. can be regulated under e-money regulations. Crypto firms with digital assets for cross-border payments could be subject to payments services regulations, but the tokens themselves wouldn’t be regulated.  The Treasury announced in January that crypto adverts will be subject to FCA rules. Meanwhile, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has been clamping down on crypto ads to make sure they comply with current regulations and don’t mislead consumers.  What is next?  What the U.K. really seems to be missing are ways to regulate cryptocurrencies themselves.  ""I think the real unregulated aspects [in the U.K.] are other crypto assets, especially cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum,"" Patrick Gruhn, head of FTX Europe, which has been considering expanding to the U.K., said in an interview with CoinDesk.  The answer to what is next also partly depends on what crypto companies and trade groups have pushed to the U.K. Treasury. The Treasury has been in discussions with a number of firms, including the Gemini exchange and crypto trade groups, CNBC reported.  The U.K. Treasury didn’t respond to a request for comment.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/31/the-uk-wants-to-regulate-crypto-heres-what-that-could-look-like,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/455eb5207857da0b9fe5d1a90808a753306cb6dd-2005x1496.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gita Gopinath, the first deputy managing director at the IMF, made the comments in an interview with the Financial Times published Thursday.  Gopinath said that ""all of these will get even greater attention following the recent episodes, which draws us to the question of international regulation."" She advocated for a coordinated approach to fill a gap in international regulation.  Measures imposed by western countries on Russia ""could encourage the emergence of small currency blocs based on trade between separate groups of countries,"" she said.  While the dollar may become less dominant in the international financial system, it will remain the major global currency, even if fragmented, according to Gopinath.  Gopinath's comments reiterate the stance taken by the IMF last year, when it outlined the need for a global approach to crypto regulation.

Angel investors who participated in the round included Yield Guild Games CEO Gabby Dizon, Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou and a16z adviser Alex Price.  The funding will help Battlebound scale and release its two game titles in development in phases that are quicker to market. The company will also expand its development and operations teams, Battlebound CEO Adam Hensel told CoinDesk in an email.  A16z has become one of the dominant players in crypto investing. Last summer, the firm raised $2.2 billion for its third crypto fund, which was the largest ever in the crypto industry until Paradigm raised a $2.5 billion fund in November.  ""The founding team of Battlebound is a rare mix of web3 savvy and veteran game development expertise – collectively Adam Hensel and team have helped build some of the industry’s most successful games such as Teamfight Tactics, League of Legends, and Overwatch 2,"" Jonathan Lai, general parter at a16z, told CoinDesk in an email. ""Their inaugural project ‘the Evaverse’ was proof of their capabilities with a small team, and we’re excited to support them as they scale up to even more ambitious experiences on chain.""  Game lineup  Founded in May 2021, Battlebound is currently developing two games. Evaverse is a metaverse game that’s open platform for other non-fungible token (NFT) communities to integrate playable avatars. The second game, codenamed Project A, is a next-gen creature collection game in which players can discover, battle and own assets. Project A will also be interoperable with Evaverse.  Read more: Animoca Brands, Ubisoft Invest in $12M Round for Blockchain Game 'Cross the Ages'  Last year, Battlebound launched an NFT collection of 10,000 playable game avatars, which generated $3 million in funding. The next NFT collection will launch later this year.  However, Evaverse doesn’t require players to connect a crypto wallet or purchase an NFT to begin playing.  “All our games will be built for NFT and non-NFT players alike, said Hensel, who previously worked as a technical artist at Riot Games. “We believe the blockchain ownership model enhances an already superb gaming experience. Like free-to-play games, players should have a great time playing before committing to any purchase.”  Token launch  Project A is in the early pre-production stage with the launch potentially coming in early 2023.  “We believe in building very closely with our community and sharing in the journey with players. We will have an immersive development process that encourages and rewards players for being part of it as the game takes shape,” said Hensel.  Battlebound is developing a tokenomics model based on the native EVA token, which will back the earning economy within Evaverse and is expected to launch later this year.  “Our priority for launching the tokens at Battlebound is to create long-term sustainable growth in the ecosystem that shares rewards with our players for spending their time and energy playing our games,” said Hensel.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/31/a16z-dapper-labs-lead-48m-round-for-p2e-gaming-startup-battlebound,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52ac053c77f49c408836ccde547ccc58d72cf6f0-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The deal, which was expected to complete later this year, was called off by a mutual agreement, according to reports.  The acquisition was subject to approval from German regulator BaFIN.  BXM Operations is a Swiss-based entity founded by the CEO and chief financial officer of BitMEX. In January, BXM had signed a purchase agreement with Dietrich von Boetticher, the owner of the bank that was founded in 1754.  “Following further talks between BXM Operations AG and the owner of Bankhaus von der Heydt, the two parties have mutually decided not to pursue the planned takeover any further,"" a spokesman for the bank told German financial website Finanz Szene.de.  The deal would have given BitMEX a banking license in Germany, where regulated entities are allowed to custody digital assets, and provided a shot in the arm for the Munich-based bank.

42394259,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaoKP,1648733400,"Biden Executive Order, Ukraine War Present US Lawmakers an Unprecedented Crypto Learning Opportunity","In the last month, we have seen two major developments that bode well for cryptocurrency’s future.  On Feb. 26, the Ukrainian government began accepting crypto donations as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion. Then, on March 9, the White House issued an executive order directing federal agencies to coordinate their approach to the sector.  If the crypto industry builds off both events, it can help correct misguided thinking about digital assets and help lawmakers create intelligent, long-lasting regulation that protects investors without compromising the innovation that has fueled the industry’s growth. The opportunity is historic.  Openness to crypto’s benefits  The executive order, which many crypto advocates worried would create a restrictive environment for digital assets, welcomed the industry to engage with lawmakers to develop clear, straightforward policies that address crypto’s unique qualities. Rather than make definitive proposals, it directed the Treasury Department and other agencies to examine and report on various aspects of crypto. It created openings for crypto companies and industry organizations to gently educate agencies, which have struggled to understand how crypto works and why it improves on fiat monetary systems.  Read More: Joe Biden’s Crypto Executive Order Is a Symbol  This is significant. The federal government sees its primary role as a protector of everything, including consumers, the financial system and national security. The executive order expressed a refreshing openness to the positive aspects of crypto.  A false narrative  Since Russia invaded Ukraine, we have witnessed two crypto narratives arise related to sanctions evasion and crypto donations. The first, which is getting significant attention in Washington and has yet to be proven, is that Russian oligarchs are using cryptocurrency to avoid severe economic sanctions by the U.S. and other countries who have opposed Russia’s attack.  Federal regulators and investigators have been adamant that sanctioned Russians are not using crypto to avoid sanctions at scale. One week after the executive order was signed the Digital Assets Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act was introduced to allow the president to add non-U.S.-based crypto companies to sanctions lists if they support sanctions evasion.  Missing from these headlines is a discussion about the tools and resources available to monitor bad actors using blockchain technology.  What policymakers must understand is that a vast majority of centralized exchanges already have comprehensive compliance programs in place, and sanctioned individuals and companies are barred from using these crypto exchanges.  Further, the scale of the blow to the country’s financial services industry and Russia’s limited adoption of crypto make it nearly impossible for Russians to use crypto to replace billions of dollars already frozen or locked due to sanctions.  Read More: Biden’s Executive Order on Crypto Met With Relief From Key Industry Players  The liquidity needed to convert millions of dollars in crypto would require trades to take place over several days, if not weeks. Additionally, every transaction would be documented and tracked on a blockchain ledger, making it easier for international authorities to flag and find bad actors.In short, moving large amounts of crypto would be nearly impossible.  “The scale that the Russian state would need to successfully circumvent all U.S. and partners’ financial sanctions would almost certainly render cryptocurrency as an ineffective primary tool for the state,” according to Carol House, the director of cybersecurity for the National Security Council. The industry must make this clear to policymakers – particularly those crying foul.  An underreported narrative  The second narrative, which has received little attention from policymakers, is how to help Ukrainians use crypto. The crisis has highlighted the need for quick, efficient cross-border payments to deliver real time aid to those who need it most.  Within hours of the Russian invasion, numerous nonprofit organizations and funding efforts began providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine. It became increasingly clear that sending donations via traditional banking methods is difficult given the high cost of moving money across borders. There was also no time frame around how long it would take for money to reach people on the ground.  Cue crypto and its ability to facilitate cross-border payments in a fraction of the time and with almost no cost. The Ukrainian government quickly realized that crypto was the surest way to support its fundraising efforts, and started accepting direct crypto donations.  Within days, Ukraine had raised nearly $100 million in direct aid. Crypto is responsible for such fast, effective fundraising. Without this technology, timely humanitarian and military aid would not have been possible.  A powerful opportunity  This real-world situation, coupled with the executive order, is a powerful opportunity for industry to demonstrate to policymakers how crypto can be used for good. The revolutionary payment system, with a public and traceable ledger, has the potential to change the way we send, store and receive money, especially during times of crisis.  The crypto industry has already taken proactive steps to engage with policymakers and follow established financial services industry regulations. These critical actions have helped the industry gain trust in Washington. However, dialogue from the broader industry must increase.  While there are still powerful cryptocurrency skeptics in the federal government, the fact that the White House itself is receptive to crypto’s potential provides an opening for crafting reasonable, effective regulation. The crypto industry would be hugely remiss to miss this opportunity.  Now, more than ever, the industry needs to educate policymakers and show them that crypto is and can be a force for good.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: The ether-bitcoin ratio is poised for a monthly gain. Observers say markets haven't fully grasped the bullish implications of Ethereum's impending proof-of-stake Merge.  Featured Story: Crypto industry mobilizes against proposed EU transparency rules.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Michele Schneider, managing director, Marketgauge Group  Nischal Shetty, CEO, WazirX  Ben McMillan, CIO, IDX Digital Assets  Amitoj Singh, regulatory reporter for India, CoinDesk  Cordell Broadus, crypto entrepreneur  Adam Darrah, former CIA and director of dark ops, ZeroFox  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  The ether-bitcoin ratio appears to be on track to end March with a 6% gain, which would be its first monthly gain since November.  The renewed upswing following a three-month decline perhaps stems from investors dedicating more money to ether amid optimism surrounding Ethereum's impending proof-of-stake Merge.  According to some observers, the market hasn't priced in the bullish effects of the upgrade. So, the rotation of money out of bitcoin and ether could continue in the near term.  ""We actually think that the market still hasn't fully grasped what's about to happen with Ethereum,"" Vance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, said in an email. ""While there's been much media attention paid to how the upgrade will make the network more environmentally friendly, this is a sideshow compared to the massive supply shock that could be on the horizon. With this merge, Ethereum will experience a 90% decrease in supply issuance.  ""To put this into perspective, to achieve an analogous reduction in supply issuance of this magnitude, the Bitcoin network would have to undergo three additional halvings,"" Spencer added.  At press time, ETH/BTC traded at 0.07235 on the Binance exchange, representing a 0.5% gain on the day. Ether traded 1% higher at $3,415, and bitcoin was up 0.20% at $47,170.  Bitcoin's rally stalled at the 200-day moving average hurdle placed above $48,000 early this week. ""Bitcoin continues to cautiously retreat lower from its 200-day moving average at $48,200, building up strength ahead of a likely move north. The decline in US stock indices on Wednesday after four days of growth also did not contribute to the positive dynamics,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said.  Nevertheless, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value appears to be set to end the month with a 9% gain, having risen by 12.2% last month, CoinDesk data shows.  The structure of consecutive monthly gains following a three-month losing streak resembles the reversal higher seen after June 2021. Bitcoin hit a record high of $69,000 in November.  It remains to be seen if the latest reversal higher translates into a bull run. Short duration charts indicate the path of least resistance is to the higher side.  The triangle breakout confirmed this month has put the bulls back into the driver's seat. The bullish formation looks similar to the breakout seen in early April 2019, following which the cryptocurrency rallied nearly 250% to reach $13,880 by the end of June of that year.  ""Bitcoin has room for near-term upside follow-through toward the next resistance near $51.0K, defined by a 50% retracement level. Above that, secondary resistance near $55.2K would be targeted,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said. ""We move to an intermediate-term bullish bias noting intermediate-term momentum has shifted positively and the 50-day MA is pointing up.""

The committee is set to vote Thursday on measures that could effectively end all anonymous crypto transfers in the bloc, require verification of transfers to private or “unhosted” wallets and prohibit crypto transfers between the EU and tax havens.  The provisions, which were put in place over concerns that crypto is used for illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing, seem to have the support of a majority of lawmakers.

42374967,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4hf9,1648732704,EU Parliament Passes Privacy-Busting Crypto Rules Despite Industry Criticism,"European Union lawmakers voted today in favor of controversial measures to outlaw anonymous crypto transactions, a move the industry said would stifle innovation and invade privacy.  More than 90 lawmakers voted in favor of the proposal, according to documents seen by CoinDesk.  The proposals are intended to extend anti-money laundering (AML) requirements that apply to conventional payments over EUR 1,000 ($1,114) to the crypto sector. They also scrap the floor for crypto payments, so payers and recipients of even the smallest crypto transactions would need to be identified, including for transactions with unhosted or self-hosted wallets.  Further measures under discussion could see unregulated crypto exchanges cut off from the conventional financial system.  National governments said in December they wanted to scrap the EUR 1,000 threshold for crypto, on the basis that digital payments can easily circumvent the limit, and to include private wallets that aren’t operated by regulated crypto asset providers.  Members of the center-right European People’s Party (EPP) opposed many of the more controversial changes, condemning what they called a “de facto ban of self-hosted wallets.”  “Such proposals are neither warranted nor proportionate,” EPP economic spokesperson Markus Ferber said in an emailed statement Thursday. “With this approach of regulating new technologies, the European Union will fall further behind other, more open-minded jurisdictions.”  A separate legal proposal also discussed today would stop transfers being made to “non-compliant” crypto service providers, which includes those operating in the EU without authorization or that are not affiliated to or established in any jurisdiction.  The Thursday vote came in spite of objections from major industry participants, such as Coinbase, and from legal experts who warned that overly heavy-handed privacy violations could face legal challenges in EU courts.  Under the new rules, Coinbase would have to report to the authorities any time a customer received over EUR 1,000 of crypto from a self-hosted wallet, the exchange’s CEO Brian Armstrong warned in a tweet posted Wednesday.  The plans must also be agreed on by both the parliament and national ministers, who meet as the EU Council, in order to pass into law.  Bitcoin’s price dropped about 2% in minutes as the vote came through, falling from $47,500 to $46,400.

42374973,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4hnx,1648732369,Fed’s Preferred Inflation Gauge Up 6.4% in February to Four-Decade High,"The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE), showed annual inflation rose 6.4% in February, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday.  The inflation rate accelerated from the 6% clip reported a month ago. The February pace was the highest since 1982.  Some crypto traders watch inflation readings closely because the bitcoin (BTC) market sometimes moves after economic indicators are released. Some investors hold bitcoin as a protection against inflation. The cryptocurrency was little changed after the report was published, changing hands at around $47,500 at press time.  The report also showed that consumer spending slowed to 0.2%, from 2.7% in January.  While the consumer price index (CPI) is regarded as the most widely watched inflation tracker, the Fed prefers to look at the PCE report, which reflects the prices that people spend for certain goods and services and how their spending behavior changes when prices rise.  The U.S. central bank says that the PCE offers a better representation of inflation, partly because it encompasses a broader range of costs.  Inflation remains high as the war in Ukraine is causing natural gas prices to skyrocket and as supply chain issues are bringing food prices to new highs.  On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its monthly jobs report. According to Dow Jones, economists expect 460,000 jobs were added in March and an unemployment rate of 3.7%, down from 3.8% in February.

The popular go-between for crypto traders keeps its dollar peg with a mix of cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasuries. There are just under 52 billion USDC in circulation as of press time, according to Circle’s website. USDC is the crypto market’s second-largest stablecoin by issuance size, behind only Tether’s USDT.  That Circle is trumpeting legacy banking partner BNY Mellon speaks to the issuer’s vested interest in building trust in its stablecoin brand. Competing stablecoin issuers have come under fire in the past for their less than transparent business practices.  But the tie-up (and the mere fact of its publicity) is no less notable for BNY Mellon, one of the financial world’s largest custodians. Lending its credibility to USDC could serve to bolster the BNY brand among crypto clients.  “Our role as a custodian for USDC reserves supports the broader marketplace and brings value to clients,” BNY Mellon CEO of Asset Servicing and Head of Digital Roman Regelman said in a press statement.  A spokesperson for the bank confirmed BNY Mellon is currently custodying the reserve assets. The pair are exploring future opportunities in custody that could include the crypto itself.  BNY Mellon’s crypto custody tech is powered by Fireblocks, the $8 billion firm that BNY Mellon invested in last March.",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | USDT | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/31/bny-mellon-to-custody-assets-backing-circles-usdc-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a06d028cd3f78db0de90edfac65cb16f4a5cf914-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CORRECTION (March 31, 15:35 UTC): Updated to properly reflect expected hashrate as of spring 2023.  CleanSpark expects about 50MW of the purchased capacity to be operational by the end of this year, with the remaining 150MW to be fully online during spring 2023, the company said in a statement. At full deployment of the 200MW power capacity, the miner’s hashrate is expected to be 10.4 exahash per second (EH/s), or more than double previous guidance for year-end 2022. At full deployment of the additional 300MW power capacity (no timeline given), CleanSpark's hashrate will be 16 EH/s.  In comparison, Core Scientific (CORZ), the largest publicly traded bitcoin miner by hashrate, expects its year-end mining capacity to reach 40 EH/s-42 EH/s. Meanwhile, Marathon Digital (MARA) sees its hashrate at approximately 23.3 EH/s by early 2023, and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) anticipates hitting 12.8 EH/s by the end of 2022.  CleanSpark’s stock has been a sizable outperformer in 2022, gaining 30% versus declines of 22% for Core Scientific, 10% for Marathon and 1% for Riot.  “We continue to build more capacity at our own bitcoin mining facilities while we partner with colocation service providers,” said CleanSpark’s CEO Zach Bradford in the statement. “This hybrid approach helps us ensure that we always have rackspace ready to deploy new machines when they are delivered to us by the manufacturers,” he added.

42410891,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt3Gy,1648731000,The Growing Digital Asset Lifeline in Ukraine,"As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues, digital assets have played an important role in international support for Ukraine’s defenses and humanitarian efforts.  In an outraged response to the war, people from around the world are pouring assets into Ukraine – at least $100 million, as of earlier this month – using the alternative financial system built around cryptocurrencies.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.  “There are a couple of things going on here: One is that crypto enables you to move assets person to person without intermediaries, which is a virtue when you are in a conflict zone and access to financial intermediaries is unreliable at best,” said Alex Tapscott, managing director of alternative investment manager Ninepoint Partners and co-author of “Blockchain Revolution.” “In Ukraine, not only are charities raising money, but other civil and societal organizations are raising money as well, including the government.”  The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) UkraineDAO has raised over $7 million in direct crypto payments for nonprofit organizations in the country, supported by the sale of Ukrainian flag non-fungible tokens (NFT) and promoted by Russian art collective Pussy Riot, in addition to a number of fintech and crypto concerns.  A number of organizations and individuals, including Ukrainian boxer Wladimir Klitschko, are also raising and sending money to benefit the work of organizations like the Red Cross within Ukraine, at times involving digital assets in their giving.  Big giving  Digital assets have also enabled millions of dollars to be transmitted directly to these organizations, to civilians on the ground in Ukraine and to the Ukrainian government and military, said Tapscott, as Ukrainians were cut off from some charity and crowdfunding campaigns.  “At least one of the big charities in Ukraine that was using crowdfunding platforms found itself cut off,” said Tapscott. “The concern was that they were violating the platform’s terms of service, which didn’t allow you to raise money to buy weaponry.”  Individuals, organizations and countries have had major security and logistical issues sending cash into conflict zones, said Tapscott. Notoriously, in 2007, the U.S. sent $12 billion to Iraq, including billions of dollars of shrink-wrapped cash on pallets, only to have much of it go unaccounted for. But cryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable, and for the most part transparent. So not only can cryptocurrency get to where the donor wants it to go but the donor has evidence that it went into the right hands –and crypto is allowing donors to give more directly than they have in the past.  Many of the suppliers to the Ukrainian military prefer to be paid in crypto, said John Sarson, the CEO of Sarson Funds, a crypto asset manager.  “With the ability to donate cryptocurrency, never before have you been able to see donations make such a difference,” said Sarson. “Generals in Ukraine say that 40% of their suppliers are now accepting cryptocurrency directly. For those that don’t, Ukraine can just sell crypto into cash and then pay cash. Ukraine passed legislation in recent weeks to legalize crypto because they are getting a giant net benefit out of it.”  Tapscott said the donations are coming from all over the world using different kinds of tokens and assets, ranging from a few dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Notably, Polkadot ecosystem co-founder Gavin Wood sent over $5 million worth of his DOT tokens to support Ukraine’s defense.  “There are remarkable people just looking for ways to make a difference,” Tapscott said. “For 30 years we’ve had this internet of information, an amazing tool for communication and sharing but not so good for moving and sharing money. A decade ago, in this kind of situation, what could someone do? Donate to the Red Cross, or post something on social media showing their support for whatever side they wanted to support; now you can put ammunition in the hands of people fighting for their freedom.”  Crypto in Russia  On the other side of the conflict, Russia’s population of more than 145 million is now cut off from the global financial system and the global economy, said Tapscott, and cryptocurrencies might be a refuge for Russian citizens amid international sanctions.  “It’s not the fault of the people that they live in a country where the government devalued their own currency; here you have a situation in Russia where many people don’t care for this war and it isn’t fair to them that their bank accounts are frozen and the ruble isn’t worth anything,” said Adam Blumberg, co-founder of PlannerDAO, an educational provider for financial advisors in the digital assets space.  In recent weeks, banks and payments companies have frozen, suspended or completely discontinued their business in Russia. In some cases, the exits have been devastating for the Russian people – according to Tapscott, Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) alone account for 70% of transactions in Russia, and both companies have suspended operations in the country.  While banks and other traditional financial institutions flee Russia amid sanctions, many crypto companies are staying put. Binance, for example, deemed calls to freeze Russian accounts as “overreach,” and Kraken has also resisted calls for a blanket suspension on all Russian users. Others, like MetaMask and Coinbase (COIN), have temporarily frozen Russian accounts.  “So far most crypto companies have resisted the mass exodus from Russia, though they are suspending the accounts of people suspected of criminal activity and freezing the accounts of sanctioned individuals, but they’re not suspending the ability of typical Russians who are not criminals from using their services,” Tapscott said. “Businesses usually operate the way they think the world should work, and the crypto industry generally has this belief that it’s bad behavior to just cut people off when there’s no requirement that they do so.”  Because crypto transactions are irrevocable, they have some attraction to Russians seeking to circumvent sanctions, but because they are transparent the international community will likely know who is sending money and where that money is going. Experts have noted that crypto is unlikely to be a workaround for sanctions evasion.  Most crypto firms seem to be taking a targeted approach, freezing the accounts of individuals who are being sanctioned but allowing assets to continue to flow. Russians are increasingly turning to digital assets to make payments, save and make payroll, Tapscott said, as the value of the ruble has cratered.  Crypto’s evolving role  As the world becomes more unstable, there’s a growing role for digital assets as a hedge against geopolitical risk and as a lifeline for people whose access to the global financial system has been removed or restricted, Tapscott said.  “There’s a Lenin quote, ‘There are some weeks where decades happen,’” he said. “I believe that was meant to refer to political change, but I think it also applies to an acceleration in the adoption of crypto assets. We’re seeing clear signs that this conflict is accelerating the adoption and use of crypto. The fact that American and European officials have weaponized fiat currencies to penalize Russia acts in the long term as a tailwind as well for anything you can self-custody and is not tied to a government or a corporation.”",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/31/the-growing-digital-asset-lifeline-in-ukraine,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ec60f01db6a1b76e80ad5c60bad8002267a1f49-3500x2333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether (ETH) remained flat at the $3,400 mark alongside binance coin (BNB) and XRP. Avalanche’s AVAX token rose 7% as its first-ever developer and community conference drew to a close this week.  Crypto markets added 0.7% in the past 24 hours with strong gains in cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization between $1 billion and $5 billion. Zilliqa's ZIL tokens surged 20%. The token is up 289% since last week. Meanwhile, IOST surged as much as 40%.  Some analysts said capital rotation to altcoins came as risk appetite returned among investors.  “There is a search for new ideas, away from institutional capital and the eyes of politicians,” FxPro market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in an email to CoinDesk. “There is an influx of stablecoins to centralized platforms, which may indicate the interest of investors in the upcoming purchases of cryptocurrencies.”  SOL jumped 14% to $127 in the past 24 hours. That's a two-month high and close to resistance of $130. Growth came as OpenSea – the biggest non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace by volume – said it will start to support Solana-based NFTs on its platform in April.  Bitcoin (BTC) held above the $47,000 mark as blockchain entity Luna Foundation Group (LFG) continued to bid on the asset. LFG seeks to purchase over $10 billion in bitcoin as a reserve for Terra’s UST stablecoin. It is building a bitcoin-denominated reserve as an additional layer of security for UST, the fourth-largest stablecoin in circulation, as reported.  Price charts show bitcoin continues to hold above its 200-day moving average at $47,200, building up strength ahead of a likely move to over $53,000, according to some traders. The decline in U.S. stocks on Wednesday after four days of gains also didn't contribute to the positive dynamics, the traders said.  U.S. indexes suggested mixed sentiment ahead of Thursday’s open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.04%, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.28%.

42374964,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4hdt,1648726126,Zilliqa's ZIL Quadruples on Optimism Around Start of Metaverse Service Metapolis,"Smart contract platform Zilliqa's ZIL token has charted a threefold rally in six days to become one of the best performing cryptocurrency of the month.  The token has increased 300% to $0.186 from $0.045 on March 26 – with prices jumping nearly 20% in the past 24 hours, according to data source Messari. At press time, the cryptocurrency boasted a 321% gain for the month, the highest among digital assets with market values of at least $1 billion.  Social media chatter reveals optimism about Zilliqa's Metapolis, a metaverse-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform, scheduled to launch with a VIP event on Saturday in Miami.  ""We are just getting started,"" Redditor BlockChayne said in a Reddit post early this week after taking stock of Zilliqa's progress in 2021. ""Leading the charge is the groundbreaking, game-changing Metapolis, which will allow Zilliqa to spread its meta-wings across a range of verticals and blockchains.""  Metaverse is a superset of virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet. It essentially tries to recreate the democratic real world in a digital space. According to a Markets and Markets report, the augmented reality market is estimated to grow to $77 billion by 2025 from $15.3 billion now at a 38.1% compound annual growth rate. The virtual reality market is projected to grow to $20.9 billion in 2025 from $6.1 billion.  Why is Zilliqa going up?  Metapolis, which is referred to as ""metaverse for all,"" is a service setup, offering a blank canvas for clients to build their own virtual universe as they desire.  While observers foresee Metaverse industry booming over the coming years, accessing the same is challenging for the general population, as building virtual infrastructure requires significant investment and technological expertise. Last year, Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook, lost $10 billion on its augmented and virtual reality operations. The loss was reportedly five times bigger than the amount Facebook paid to purchase Oculus VR in 2014 and 10 times bigger than what Facebook paid to acquire Instagram.  Metaverse-as-a-service providers like Metapolis provide required technology and infrastructure to enable users to create and maintain their own metaverses. The service providers essentially remove the high-cost entry barrier, opening doors for smaller players.  ""Metapolis, whose suffix means 'city' in Greek, is designed as a cutting-edge extended reality (XR metaverse)- an amalgamation of AR and VR – and is powered by Zilliqa's scalable and secure blockchain platform,"" Aparna Narayanan, head of communications at Zilliqa, said in a blog post published in December.  ""Metapolis will allow conceptually rich and custom-designed domes as part of cities that can house brands, artists, concepts, games, e-stores, real estate or other digital experiences – offering a new layer of engagement for both the physical and digital worlds. Metapolis looks to be self-sustaining and includes engagement layers such as NFTs, e-commerce, play-to-earn, digital mannequins, advertising billboards and more,"" Narayanan added.  According to the press release dated March 25, Metapolis is built on ""unreal engine"" – an advanced real-time 3D creation tool for visuals and immersive experiences, which means the user experience is likely to rival those of top games.  Metapolis secured $2 million in pre-launch revenue from its client pipeline and recently announced a partnership with Agora,a global talent awards app.  ""We are excited for this partnership as we are able to bring not only creativity to life within the metaverse but also open borderless access for creatives worldwide to connect in the digital world. The partnership between Agora, Zilliqa and Metapolis means we are at the forefront of Web 3 innovation,"" Sandra Helou, head of metaverse and non-fungible tokens at Zilliqa, said in the presser.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | AR,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/31/zilliqas-zil-quadruples-on-optimism-around-start-of-metaverse-service-metapolis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d339810432d49f4e1cce244f8fdf4c52f04abf3-1940x1374.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422847,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qThh,1648724595,Crypto Industry Mobilizes Against Proposed EU Transparency Rules,"Robert Kopitsch has been working around the clock to engage with European Union (EU) lawmakers ahead of a parliamentary committee vote targeting crypto transfers.  Kopitsch, secretary general of Brussels-based lobby group Blockchain for Europe, and other crypto advocates have been rallying supporters worldwide to sway members of the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The committee is set to vote Thursday on measures that could effectively end all anonymous crypto transfers in the bloc, require verification of transfers to private or “unhosted” wallets, and prohibit crypto transfers between the EU and tax havens.  The provisions, put in place over concerns that crypto is used for illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing, seem to have the support of a majority of lawmakers. Critics say the measures are a violation of privacy.  “We're encouraging everybody to write to their [representatives], reach out to them with tweets and social media, and to give them the feeling that what they're doing is super wrong. And it's not so easy, obviously, right? Because here, it's a more political topic,” Kopitsch said.  Crypto heavyweights from around the world such as Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong and other EU lawmakers such as Vice President of the European Parliament Eva Kaili have shown support for measures that do not over-regulate the space.  Those in favor of heavy anti-money laundering (AML) measures for crypto transfers including Paul Tang, an EU parliamentarian and chair of the tax committee, took issue with the campaign.  “The #crypto sector demands to be taken seriously yet they refuse to take seriously their role in the fight against criminal money. Their aggressive campaigning only shows that strong regulation is urgently needed,” he tweeted on Wednesday.  Kopitsch agreed regulation is needed, but said the proposed regulations may be too heavy handed. “They think that all the transactions that run [on] crypto are all done by criminals. It's all money laundering. It's all child pornography, terrorist financing,” Kopitsch said, adding that politicians in favor of such provisions do not see the many benefits of crypto and their underlying technologies.  From Germany, Patrick Hansen, head of strategy at Unstoppable Finance, and an outspoken critic of the provision calling for AML checks on transfers to unhosted wallets, has also been rallying members of the crypto community to engage with lawmakers.  Both Kopitsch and Hansen say the vote is too close to call.  The MiCA campaign  Earlier this month, lobbying by the industry reaped benefits. Hansen spearheaded a campaign to persuade an economic committee to vote against a provision in a draft of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, the EU’s main legislation package for governing crypto assets, that would have effectively outlawed popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.  While that provision did not make it through the vote, Hansen and others were quite certain that even if wasn't rejected at the committee stage, it would not make it into the final version of the legislation after further negotiations with the EU government branches.  But in this case, Hansen fears that if it goes through, the provision on AML checks for transfers to unhosted wallets may make it to the final draft.  “There might be a window of opportunity to change minor things, but the chances are way higher that if it goes through the parliament committee on Thursday, and then it's not challenged, that basically this will just be adopted,” Hansen said.  Meanwhile, Hansen said another provision, calling for an end to the 1,000 euro ($1,100 U.S.) minimum threshold for reporting crypto transactions, is likely to make it through the committee vote.  “I feel like if there is multi-party support for dropping that threshold, who should we convince? ...

42374966,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4hgP,1648717916,"Crypto Popularity Could Pose Stability Risk, EU Watchdog Warns, as It Ponders New Powers","European Union banks could face stricter limits on their crypto holdings to prevent the burgeoning market in virtual assets upending the financial system, the bloc’s financial-stability watchdog said.  “The entry of new institutions and the use of new financial products, some of which have quickly gained popularity (e.g., crypto assets, stablecoins, etc.), has the potential to pose risks to financial stability,” the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) said in a concept note published Thursday.  The ESRB, set up after the 2008 crisis and chaired by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, is considering whether to extend the controls supervisors can impose to protect the EU's financial system. As well as monitoring individual institutions, regulators can impose “macroprudential” measures to limit larger problems, for example, to ensure that banks can’t give mortgages that are too generous compared with a borrower’s salary and calm overheating housing markets.  The ESRB suggested that those tools should extend beyond banking into other institutions, including new financial technology players, and large companies such as Meta (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOG) Google.  The ESRB also called for “quick adoption and implementation” of the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), which it said would help control financial stability risks. Late-stage negotiations between the European Parliament and national governments on the rules begin Thursday.  In a November consultation that closed recently, the European Commission asked whether supervisors need extra powers to tackle the financial stability risks of crypto-based products and competitive pressures from the potential arrival of new fintech participants.  Fuller advice on that question is due from the ESRB “in the coming weeks,” it said today. So far the commission’s idea has got a mixed reception from among the EU’s 27 member countries.  In a letter dated March 17, Swedish authorities said it wasn’t clear if existing rules were enough to tackle crypto risks. Just four days later, the Italian central bank suggested keeping the focus on more traditional policies that look at individual banks, as crypto exposures are “currently tiny ... the use of crypto assets for payments is limited to niche groups.""  International standard setters, aided by the ECB, are also looking at how much lending banks should be allowed to conduct against their crypto holdings. An initial proposal made by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the global standard-setter for banking regulation, last year was rejected following criticism from the financial sector that it was too cautious, in effect ruling out any incentive for banks to get into the market.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/31/crypto-popularity-could-pose-stability-risk-eu-watchdog-warns-as-it-ponders-new-powers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8f6b456019612db1c0743b12e031461b843ed4c-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374956,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw4hTp,1648710000,Crypto Firms Weigh Options as UK Registration Deadline Looms,"Crypto companies wanting to operate in the U.K. have until Thursday to receive the approval of financial watchdog Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). So far, just 33 have passed the regulator’s checks.  More than 100 firms applied for registration after the FCA introduced a temporary scheme in December 2020, having become the country’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing supervisor for the crypto industry at the beginning of the year. Some 60 have either been refused permanent registration or withdrawn their applications.  The outlook for the 13 remaining companies in the Temporary Registration Regime (TRR) was muddied on Wednesday when the FCA said it was extending the March 31 deadline for “a small number of firms where it is strictly necessary to continue to have temporary registration."" It didn’t name the companies, and didn’t say how long the extension would last.  Among those awaiting an outcome are Copper, a provider of crypto services for institutions; Revolut, a fintech company with a $33 billion valuation that offers cryptocurrency buying; and crypto exchange and digital wallet provider Blockchain.com, which is reportedly valued at $14 billion.  Some in the industry say the FCA has been taking an unnecessarily risk-averse approach to the approval process.  It is “disqualifying registration on the basis of super trivial things,” said the CEO of one firm set to withdraw its application who requested anonymity to avoid upsetting the FCA. “They’re looking for the tiniest little scratch and using that to invalidate the entire application,” the CEO told CoinDesk.  The criticism echoes that of Blockchain.com CEO Peter Smith, who cut into the FCA in an interview with U.K. newspaper The Telegraph in February. Smith said the regulator was not “eager enough to foster innovation and to work with the industry.” The U.K. has “fallen behind” as a result, he said. Blockchain.com in May earned a $5.2 billion valuation following a $300 million funding round.  Firms that are regulated in other jurisdictions have the option of pivoting their operations elsewhere to continue doing business. Earlier this week, crypto payments provider Wirex revealed it had withdrawn its application and plans to serve U.K. customers through its subsidiary licensed in Croatia.  Not all have this option, however.  “They’re screwed, I think, unless they can spin up a new entity in an unregulated area, which they might do,” said the CEO of one of the firms preparing to use an overseas jurisdiction, who also requested anonymity. “I know that some of these firms have been either in the process of [initial public offering] prep or serious funding talks and then those conversations have materially collapsed as a result of the FCA’s approach here, which is not meritocratic and is super subjective.”  There is another choice: legal action, a course taken by Gidiplus, a bitcoin (BTC) ATM operator who went to court to attempt to overturn the FCA’s rejection of its application. The case was dismissed, with the judge determining there was a ""lack of evidence as to how Gidiplus would undertake its business in a broadly compliant fashion.""  The legal route is likely to end any hope of a rapprochement in the future should the FCA or the Treasury change their stance. Anyone taking this course is also likely to need deep pockets.  The FCA, which is also taking over regulation of crypto ads, said it’s working to meet its legal responsibilities.  “We are continuing our work registering crypto firms to ensure they are not a conduit for money laundering and recently launched a consultation on how crypto is marketed to consumers,” the regulator said. “We will continue to work with HM Treasury, [which sets] the scope of crypto regulation in the U.K.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/31/crypto-firms-weigh-options-as-uk-registration-deadline-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6db8cd206ec3786ffaf00fd353af905e9c39f27-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
