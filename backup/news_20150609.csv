42426372,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN5rh,1433882425,Australian Firm Faces Harassment After Paying Bitcoin Ransom,"A senior executive in Australia has reportedly been victimized after the company they work for was pressured by online hackers into paying a ransom in bitcoin worth $14,000 earlier this year.    According to a report by the Brisbane Times, the unnamed Queensland-based business suffered an internal data theft, which was followed by the ransom demand. The company paid the amount, local law enforcement officials told the news service.  Subsequent ransom demands were ignored, police explained, a decision that is said to have prompted the hackers to escalate their intimidatory tactics. The hackers threatened to damage the executive's reputation, and made further threats against the individual's child after obtaining photographs of the minor.  Acting assistant commissioner Brian Kay of the Queensland Police Service told the Times that police were working with other law enforcement agencies to identify those behind the attacks.  ""This is a very serious attack on an organization and quite traumatic for the business, the victim and his family,"" he said.  He stressed that businesses should never give in to ransom demands, stating that local companies should heighten their existing cyberattack countermeasures and report any incidents to the police.  Kay acknowledged that in many cases, firms are reticent about coming forward about hacks because of the potential harm that could be done once they are made public.

The company – which plans to issue smart securities on bitcoin's blockchain later this year – received funds from investors including Duncan Niederauer, former CEO at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Matt Andresen, former co-CEO of Citadel Derivatives Group.      The startup grew out of the Counterparty project, which in turn provided support for Overstock's Medici project during its early stages. Several developers went on to leave Medici and later established Symbiont.      Mark Smith, CEO of Symbiont, said in a statement: ""The blockchain not only has the potential to democratise markets but to drive down the cost of doing business across all sectors.""      Symbiont's focus on blockchain tech aims to improve the financial market for traders, by lowering costs and increasing security, transparency and liquidity.      ""It's an exciting, timely and much-needed development for the long-term health of the markets,"" said Niederauer, managing member of 555 Capital and member of Symbiont's board of directors.

42426377,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN61h,1433852791,Former Mastercard Exec Joins Bitreserve's Security Team,"Former MasterCard executive William Dennings has joined Bitreserve as the firm's chief information security officer (CISO).  Bitreserve  noted Dennings' appointment would be instrumental in the company's mission to set anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) controls, required to safeguard users' deposits and information.  The newly appointed CISO said:  ""Information security extends well beyond IT and customer service in the global payments sector. It's vital to the secure, instant, easy and free movement of money that Bitreserve offers our members.""  Having previously held the role of CISO at MasterCard, Dennings moved on to Nike in May 2013, where he held the same position for two years.  According to Bloomberg, he was named in a civil complaint filed by MasterCard against the sports giant, alleging he and a former engineering manager had urged colleagues to join them at Nike, in violation of their employment contracts.  Denning's announcement follows the appointment of Anthony Watson, former Nike CIO, as Bitreserve's new president and COO in April.

42426384,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN6Bh,1433842034,Australian Banks Westpac and ANZ Experiment With Ripple,"Two of Australia's 'big four' banks, Westpac Banking Corporation and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, are experimenting with peer-to-peer transfers on the Ripple protocol.  The news, revealed by The Australian Financial Review, follows last month's announcement that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) – another 'big four' rival – is trialling the tech for transfers between its subsidiaries. At the time, CBA's chief information officer David Whiteing described distributed protocols as ""the way of the future"".  While ANZ is still in early discussions with the company, Westpac, the larger of the two by market cap, told TAFR it has begun a proof-of-concept with Ripple Labs, whereby its employees are sending funds to two countries overseas.  Rachel Slade, Westpac's general manager of global transactional services, said:  ""The solution we've developed is faster than other alternatives in the market today, providing same or next-day payment. This technology could be very beneficial to all Australians, providing a low-cost and fast method of sending low-value payments overseas.""  Both Slade and an ANZ spokesperson were more guarded on the possibility of trialling cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in future, citing regulatory uncertainty.  ""The banking of cryptocurrency is technically feasible, though we don't have that capability today,"" the ANZ spokesperson said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/09/australian-banks-westpac-and-anz-experiment-with-ripple,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22b218748a9a445d00bda42a573b700d8c2f3332-1000x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426375,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN5xh,1433808023,Blockstream to Release First Open Source Code for Sidechains,"Blockstream has announced it will release an open source codebase and testing environment for its signature sidechains project.  Called Sidechains Elements, the launch is the first major release for the bitcoin startup since it published its white paper last fall. According to Blockstream, the code will allow community developers to experiment with sidechain functionality, with initial features allowing users to transact and issue digital assets.  The release comes months after Blockstream raised $21m in seed capital from investors including Reid Hoffman, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang’s AME Cloud Ventures.  In interview, Blockstream co-founder and president Dr Adam Back expressed hope that the release of Sidechains Elements would drive community members to contribute to the initiative.  Back told CoinDesk:  “Our hope is that people in the community will participate, look at it, submit patches, get involved and try out all you can do with the proposed bitcoin extensions.”  Sidechains are blockchains designed to integrate with the bitcoin blockchain by way of two-way pegs, allowing for the transfer of assets between the two networks. The project has been heralded as a potential solution to bitcoin's perceived scalability issues for its attempt to enable experimentation on bitcoin's code.  Currently, the sidechain made available for developers utilizes testnet coins rather than real bitcoins, and the decentralized peg only allows for two-way transactions between the bitcoin testnet and the sidechain testnet.  Next phase of development  According to Back, the release of Sidechains Elements will help contribute to the next phase of development: putting the code into the hands of entrepreneurs and institutions looking to utilize sidechains.  He cited banks in particular as one group of interested parties, which he noted are interested in the ability to issue and distribute assets on the blockchain, as well as provide infrastructure for what Back called “new kinds of markets”.  “This sidechain release and releases and features to follow will be a good implementation point for those kinds of projects,” he said.  Back pointed to the confidential transactions feature as one of the more notable aspects of the release, suggesting that the concept can help bring a new degree of privacy to bitcoin. Those who use the feature would be able to obscure the amount being sent from parties outside of those actively involved in the exchange or selected third parties.  BIP submission  A major step to come is the drafting and submission of a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that will call for sidechain functionality to be added to bitcoin’s codebase.  If approved, the addition to bitcoin’s code will enable the decentralized two-way peg and the ability to merge-mine sidechains with bitcoin. According to Back, the changes would require a soft fork of the network rather than a hard fork.  The startup is also planning to conduct a Reddit AMA featuring Blockstream co-founder and bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell and other members of the Blockstream team following the release.
