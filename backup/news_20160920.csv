42399331,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiw84,1474398332,"Blockchain Revolution Won't Happen 'Soon', Says Bank of England","The Bank of England has been one of the more aggressive central banks to investigate blockchain and distributed ledger technology, but at least one of its officials doesn’t believe widespread adoption will happen anytime soon.  Andrew Hauser, the central bank’s executive director for banking, payments and financial resilience, made the remarks during a speech on the history of how the Bank of England developed its settlement systems over the past 20 years. His speech took place at the CREST Twentieth Anniversary Conference on 20th September, an event commemorating the launch of the UK-based securities depository.  His comments come after the Bank of England released a consultation paper on the development of its next-generation settlement service and the role in which the technology might play. The Bank of England has spent months investigating the prospects of a central bank-issued digital currency, and recently formed a fintech accelerator aimed at supporting that and similar initiatives.  Hauser remarked that financial technology more broadly would shape the way the central bank develops new systems, going on to highlight distributed ledgers in particular. Yet he struck a conservative tone as to how quickly adoption would play out over the years to come.  Hauser told attendees:  ""There is no likelihood of such an extreme revolution occurring any time soon: much more work is needed across a whole range of issues, including: speed and scaleability; confidentiality protections; developing common protocols; integrating cash and securities movements; and establishing regulatory and legal norms.”  More likely, he went on to say, are ""less ambitious but still potentially transformational"" uses in certain areas, particularly in cases where market infrastructure could use improvement.  Hauser also noted that financial institutions looking to work with the technology need to decide whether to pursue it alone or in group fashions, a reference to efforts such as the R3 distributed ledger consortium.  ""But doing neither is a risky approach,"" he added.

42399335,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiwDy,1474392043,State Street Tests Blockchain for Investment Tracking,"State Street is working on a new blockchain project aimed at cataloging transactions tied to investment assets.  The Boston-based investment services firm is partnering with California-based blockchain startup PeerNova on the project. The prototype being developed will track funds used in investment transactions.  The firm suggested in statements that the trial could ultimately lead to a future product line focused on the tracking of assets using the technology.  Hu Liang, senior vice president for State Street’s Emerging Technology Center, said of the project:  ""Together, we are developing technology that is designed to track the lineage of capital with precision and verifiability. While currently a trial, the potential to provide that level of detail more efficiently and more effectively can bring meaningful value to our clients.""  The announcement marks State Street’s most notable initiative related to blockchain to date.  The bank is one of several dozen institutions working as part of the R3 distributed ledger consortium, and was one of the first banks to join the effort last year. Last November, State Street moved to highlight the blockchain experience of its new chief information officer.  State Street did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42399332,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiwA2,1474387970,JPMorgan Seeks Faster Settlement Times in Blockchain Trials,"In spite of massive investment in financial technology, JPMorgan Chase still has a long way to go to meet its blockchain objectives.  Abhijit Gupta, multinational bank’s head of science and technology in the Asia Pacific, told Chinese news service Sina that he was concerned about the improvements in the technology, “especially speed,” according to a translation of the article.  Gupta added:  ""Over the past year and a half, the processing time of our system [improved by] 10 times, but in fact we need to achieve is 1,000 times. ""  The details come months after the bank first began disclosing its blockchain work. In February, JPMorgan conducted an internal test moving money between London and Tokyo as part of a trial involving 2,200 of its clients, according to a Wall Street Journal report.  A month later JPMorgan unveiled its work on Juno, a distributed ledger project published as part of its involvement with the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger initiative.  Blockchain and jobs  If JPMorgan still has a ways to go before meeting its blockchain objectives, reports show the bank is financially committed to the course, along with another area of technology.  In December of last year, Business Insider reported on an internal memo from JP Morgan that revealed the bank would invest $9b in blockchain and robotics technology through the end of this year.  Speaking to Sina, Gupta provided insight into how the company views the two areas of investment, specifically as relates to concerns over their impact on employment.  ""We do not believe financial technology makes a lot of people unemployed. As more money [moves] into this area, more job opportunities will come up,"" he said.  Gupta concluded:  ""For example, in the application of robotics banking operations by reducing human error and improve efficiency, will improve the customer experience. We therefore can re-deploy staff to the department that they can continue to generate value.""

42399329,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiw93,1474371912,Nasdaq Veteran Joins Ethereum Foundation as Security Lead,"Nasdaq information security specialist Martin Holst Swende has officially joined the Ethereum Foundation as its full-time security lead.  Despite it being one of his first days on the job, Swende was highly visible at Devcon2, the non-profit's annual conference, on Tuesday. There, he moderated a panel on smart contract security and gave an overview of his view on the state of the blockchain-based decentralized application network.  Offstage, Swende opened up about his new role, explaining that he doesn't believe it was a risk for him to move from the stock market giant to the nascent blockchain industry.  Swende told CoinDesk that his now former colleagues at Nasdaq (he wasn't involved in its blockchain work) were largely positive about the move, suggesting the stigma of leaving the financial industry for a blockchain startup may be dissipating.  Swende said:  ""They understood it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They know that. My closest colleagues, I think they recognize that this a pretty big thing.""  From a glance at the Devcon2 lineup, Swende is not alone in his background.  Enterprise firms including Microsoft and IBM are set to take the stage at the event, and Santander, while not present, made waves revealing its intent to issues digital money on the ethereum blockchain.  But for Swende, the news is perhaps less surprising, as he had long been courted by the 40-member Ethereum Foundation due to his work on its bug bounty program. Swende was the most frequent contributor, reporting issues with the python client and go client, and collecting a fair share of the rewards.  Swende said his own interest in the project started before its crowdfunding effort in 2014, though he’s not exactly sure how he stumbled on the original blog posts from ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin that caught his eye.  Still, he said he remembers the impression reading Buterin’s work left on him.  ""It was eye opening. I just read about this cool technology. I didn’t know he was 20 years old,"" Swende said.  High stakes role  In addition to piquing his intellectual interest, though, the new role will find Swende coordinating with all the various projects funded by the Ethereum Foundation in order to enhance their security.  In particular, Swende will now have the difficult task of helping to ensure that development on ethereum continues safely, even while basic components of the network remain very much in early development stages.  Swende said he intends to strive to be better at providing information for smart contract developers, and that this will include the creation of a security website.  ""We need to be better at documentation and also there’s some work to do in the tools and language features,"" he said.  Still, Swende acknowledged that the collapse of The DAO gives his role an added weight. A smart contract that raised $150m this summer (only to quickly lose nearly half of it due to a security flaw), The DAO was a frequent topic of focus at the day's event.  While Swende said he doesn't want the situation to repeat, he also admitted a certain regret that he never inspected the original contract.  ""A guy asked me if I was going to invest, and I said I hadn’t audited it,"" he recalls.  He added after a pause:  ""I’ll never know if I would have found the vulnerability.""'

42399334,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiwC0,1474363324,Accenture: Absolute Immutability Will Slow Blockchain Progress,"David Treat is managing director and head of Accenture's capital markets blockchain practice.  In this opinion piece, Treat discusses how the immutability that provides trust in permissionless blockchain environments poses difficulties for financial firms seeking to adapt it for new enterprise use cases.  In a permissionless environment like bitcoin, absolute immutability is one of blockchain's greatest strengths.  For those who only believe in the permissionless mode of blockchain solutions, there is no need to discuss alternatives. But as industries explore new uses for blockchain beyond cryptocurrency and permissionless systems, there will be situations when that same immutability could make it difficult for the technology to advance.  For decentralized cryptocurrency systems, immutability has been crucial in building trust between parties and faith in the system, and that has resulted in the rapid interest and growth in this area. The value of all blockchain-based currencies in circulation was $14.37bn in mid-June, with the price of bitcoin alone rising $300 since May.  But looking beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain has huge potential to transform the world of enterprise technology. From financial services to healthcare, and from energy to education, the ability to safely, securely and transparently record and store data in a decentralized and distributed database is only just beginning to be understood.  Within the financial services sector, the level of interest in permissioned systems is growing fast. A recently published World Economic Forum report noted that 2,500 patents have been filed in just the last three years. More than 90 companies have joined blockchain consortiums, 90 banks are engaged in blockchain discussions and more than $1.4bn has been invested.  Blockchain has many practical applications within financial services right now. Banks, capital markets firms and insurers are engaged in trials, pilots, proofs of concept studies and initial production solutions. Blockchain’s audit and data-tracking capabilities are beginning to be deployed in new settings such as payments, reference data, know-your-client and trade finance, for example.  Immutability is an obvious benefit in most cases. But it's also increasingly apparent that there will be instances where absolute immutability is one of the biggest hurdles standing in the way of blockchain's adoption.  Here's why  Customers of any financial system have an expectation that something can be done ""when things goes wrong"" (which is inevitable). New or existing financial institutions will not be comfortable, or even capable from a regulatory perspective, to operate systems that don’t allow the means to fix problems quickly and effectively.  Companies will always need to have control over their technology and platforms. This control allows them to properly manage risk and meet the complex regulatory requirements that they operate under. Their risk managers will expect it and their regulators will demand it.  Moving into permissioned blockchain environments gives them this control, but it is here that absolute immutability presents a range of challenges.  Here, we’re focusing on five important ones:  · Data storage: In a world where every transaction remains on the blockchain permanently, its size will continue to grow posing eventual challenges around data storage. Hard and soft forks, and pruning, could alleviate some of this system storage stress. Currently, transaction volumes are low, but as use cases that involve on-chain data scale will expand and new solutions will be required.  · Illegal actions: On an immutable blockchain, illegal or nefarious activities could stand uncorrected. In the recent case of the $60m smart contract hack of The DAO, participants succeeded in building consensus to roll back the transaction by creating a hard fork. But many disagreed with the decision and have continued to transact on the original chain. The hard fork solution is a blunt instrument that can only practically be considered if applied quickly after the issue. This approach will be too impractical for larger scale or high stakes business processes. Even users of permissionless systems have begun to focus on the difficulties associated with this issue.  · Operational errors: Transaction booking errors are a far too frequent issue in financial services. We have to assume that human error won’t ever be completely eliminated. Executing a reversing transaction in a blockchain-based solution is not always an acceptable answer as the mis-booked information may be confidential or required by law to be removed.  · Permanent mischief: And mischief too will remain on the blockchain forever. Pornography is already permanently embedded on the bitcoin blockchain. Furthermore, in excess of 250,000 classified US diplomatic cables disclosed by Wikileaks are there, too. It is not impossible to imagine how other sensitive data – perhaps our fingerprints or our social security numbers – could end up there one day too. In a decentralized system, this may be tolerated. In a heavily regulated industry like financial services, such risks will have to be mitigated.  · Regulatory concerns: Privacy and personal information may be incompatible with an immutable blockchain. The European Union's incoming General Data Protection Regulation, a landmark ruling around consumer data privacy and ownership rights, has financial institutions scrambling to ensure their still nascent blockchain platforms will adhere to these strict regulatory guidelines. And the US Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the SEC's ""Regulation S-P"" all require personal financial data to be redactable – something that is not possible on an immutable platform.  One thing is clear – we live in an imperfect world where mistakes will be made, data will need to be updated after an event and records like personal information will need to be deleted to meet regulatory requirements.  In permissioned systems, we believe that adding the combination of a technical ability to make a change with a governance construct that participants can trust and audit will be the basis for a 'pragmatic immutability.'  This will pave the way for greater blockchain adoption outside the world of cryptocurrency. A number of solutions are in play (including one that we are introducing): improving traditional forking approaches, using ""manual overrides,"" leveraging off-chain solutions and using cryptography so changes can actually be made to a block, but will also leave a ""scar"" so they become permanently identifiable.  As blockchain’s utility continues to grow, we see the technology evolving to meet the needs of different industries. Decentralized cryptocurrency has popularized this technology and holds an important place in society. As with all new technology breakthroughs, for the world to benefit more broadly from it, we must be open to its development and evolution.

42399326,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiw66,1474360129,7 Financial Firms Test Blockchain for Data Management,"Credit Suisse, Citi and HSBC are among seven financial firms to participate in a data management trial announced today and conducted with support from blockchain firms Axoni and R3CEV.  Featuring buy-side and sell-side firms, the multi-month effort envisioned how a distributed ledger prototype could be built to enhance risk management, cost and efficiency issues when managing financial reference data. Also involved was the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), a trade group representing US securities firms.  According to a release, the prototype used Axoni Core, the startup’s proprietary distributed ledger software to simulate the collaborative management of reference data used in corporate bond issuance.  The companies said:  ""The technology enabled participants to interact with reference data after issuance, with any proposed changes requiring validation by the underwriter to ensure the ledger provided a single, immutable record of all data related to the bond.""  According to the companies involved, the project was able to demonstrate how regulators and network participants can use the technology to see which parties on a ledger have created, issued and proposed amendments to a data record.  In statements, David Rutter, CEO of R3, and Emmanuel Aido, Credit Suisse's blockchain and distributed ledger lead, spoke to the benefits that this new approach to data management could bring to the financial industry.  ""Quality of data has become a crucial issue for financial institutions in today’s markets. Unfortunately, their middle and back offices rely on legacy systems and processes – often manual – to manage and repair unclear, inaccurate reference data,"" Rutter said.

42399345,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiwJs,1474343000,Santander Vies to Become First Bank to Issue Cash on Blockchain,"Spanish banking giant Santander is working on a project that explores how it could digitize customer cash using the public ethereum blockchain.  Revealed today during a panel talk at Devcon2 by Ether.camp founder and ethereum Java client developer Roman Mandeleil, the news was confirmed by representatives of Santander. In statements, Santander said its goal is to open up its bank-issued funds to a community of innovators as a way of tapping additional efficiencies.  Given the recent deluge of proofs-of-concepts and consortium announcements, Santander's move to potentially issue digital cash on a live public blockchain emerges as one of the more unique projects globally. Running for more than a year, the ethereum network has a market cap of more than $1bn and nearly 40,000 in daily transactions.  In interview, Mandeleil explained that the Santander project envisions how the bank’s customers could convert money from their real bank accounts into a 'tokenized' online currency called 'Cash ETH' that would be redeemable for paper currency.  Mandeleil told CoinDesk:  ""These tokens are backed by real money in Santander. At any moment you can get them back and get the dollars.""  In a demonstration, Mandeleil showed how a fictional customer could use the prototype to create digital money for use at online merchants and accessible with a mnemonic passcode called a brain wallet. (Despite past issues with the concept, he called this version ""statistically hard to break"").  Santander representatives indicated that the bank is now seeking to work with Ether.camp on engaging other banking partners in the project. The two partners are also looking to run hackathons that would focus on developing use cases around micropayments.  In essence, the project aims to envision a way for banks to open up their basic bank account offerings to new ideas and transactional services. Further, Mandeleil said the project is part of his 10-person startup's vision that focuses more on using blockchain technologies to achieve incremental benefits for banks and consumers.  ""It's more like evolution, not revolution,"" he said. Still, he emphasized that the trial, should it go live, would mark a ""huge leap"" by establishing a connection between a publicly traded financial firm and and a public blockchain.  ""You can start to build more and more stuff and say to the regulators 'It's not so scary,'"" he continued.  Elsewhere, in his talk, Mandeleil discussed Ether.camp's work with blockchain startup firms including Gemini and Rootstock.  Mass media  Mandeleil showcased a system whereby a Santander customer would have three new options to coincide with their traditional bank account – tokenize, transfer or refund.  Should the user elect to 'tokenize' their funds, the system is set up to allow for payments of as low as $0.01, though small charges may add to Santander’s earnings depending on how the user chooses to allocate the funds. In the example, $350 in funds were withdraw to a test version of the ethereum blockchain, with $1 going toward gas payments, which are needed as payment to execute transactions on the network.  By paying the gas upfront, the user is allotted a certain pre-set number of transactions they can execute, though this figure can be increased with additional payment. Mandeleil sees the digital Santander dollars as a viable alternative to PayPal.  ""It's not something that users will not do to have the agility of money. You click on the payment, then you put in the private key and you have the balance and the reliable transactions,"" he said.  To offer a better view on the project, Mandeleil walked CoinDesk through a version of the prototype in which a user tokenized funds for use as payment for an article on a demo version of The New York Times website.  Users could then exchange the digital money with other users, though Mandeleil said these funds would be redeemable with Santander.  In this light, the partnership also offers the bank a new avenue by which to add to its accountholder base.  Questions ahead  According to Mandeleil, the project first began seven months ago, when Santander approached the Ether.camp team with the idea for the effort, but more work remains.  Should Santander succeed in receiving regulatory approval to ultimately move forward, it will need to contend with the challenges of potential growth.  For example, Mandeleil said he is speaking with Santander about the issues that could arise from a broad number of banks all issuing their own versions of digital cash, which might lead to interoperability and settlement issues.  Mandeleil, though, sees the current blockchain market as already providing relevant examples for how workarounds to this could be achieved. For instance, he mentioned the available cryptocurrency conversion tools as one service that could offer a potential solution should the project progress.  Going forward, Mandeleil and Santander said the partners are seeking to engage more banks in the project, which they compared to the Universal Settlement Coin project spearheaded by UBS and also involving Santander.  Representatives of Santander said that additional legal work needs to be done before moving forward, and that it is currently exploring whether it needs additional licensure.
