42398403,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTRIe,1433457067,"Stellar Enters Legal Dispute With Bitstamp, Ripple and Jed McCaleb","The legal battle over roughly $1m in disputed funds continues between Ripple Labs and founder and ex-employee Jed McCaleb, with a flurry of new court filings over the past month setting the stage for conflict between the two sides.  In total, $1,038,172 is currently being held by digital currency exchange Bitstamp, an amount that both Ripple Labs and the Stellar Development Foundation, McCaleb's current employer, are now seeking.  Both sides have weighed in on whether the court should grant Bitstamp’s request to be discharged from the case after it filed a complaint for interpleader on 1st April. As part of that request, dated 13th May, Bitstamp asked the court for permission to transfer the funds to Stellar.  Bitstamp stated at the time:  ""In the alternative, in light of Ripple’s cross-complaint indicating that its dispute with McCaleb and [McCaleb's cousin Jacob] Stephenson is a simple contract dispute to which Bitstamp is not a party, Bitstamp requests dismissal of the action.""  Bitstamp argued in its original complaint that it was unable to determine whether Ripple Labs or defendant Jacob Stephenson, McCaleb's cousin, was the rightful owner of the disputed funds.  Stephenson sold the XRP– the native currency of the Ripple network – to Ripple in a sale on Bitstamp, an action that Ripple argued was done on McCaleb's behalf in violation of a settlement agreement.  In its request, the exchange suggested that it faced the threat of litigation owing to its continued role in the lawsuit.  Growing court battle  The fight entered a new phase last month when US District Judge William Orrick ordered a temporary freeze on the disputed funds.  That order, according to court documents dated 15th May, also granted Ripple Labs expedited discovery, during which time McCaleb and Stephenson, would sit for deposition.  Ripple Labs first responded to the suit in a cross-complaint filed on 29th April, alleging breach of contract against McCaleb and claiming, among other items, that McCaleb is currently the subject of a US Department of Justice investigation. Ripple also sought to prevent McCaleb from selling any additional XRP for a period of 150 weeks.  McCaleb and his former employer had previously agreed to a timetable that would limit his ability to sell the XRP he was awarded at the outset of the company's creation over seven years.  In filings since Orrick’s 15th May order, the defendants have argued that the dispute should be handled via arbitration, citing stipulations in the agreement that governs McCaleb’s XRP sales. McCaleb and Stephenson have also contested the order to sit for deposition.  Additionally, the Stellar Development Fund has asked to be entered into the suit as an intervenor-defendant.  The defense has also questioned the basis of Bitstamp’s original complaint for interpleader itself. In Stellar’s 22nd May motion to intervene, the organization echoed past defense filings by stating that Ripple never had claim on the funds in the first place, a statement which it says is backed up by Ripple and Bitstamp’s own filings.  The filing states:  “Bitstamp clearly knew from Ripple’s own statements, as alleged in the complaint, that Ripple did not have a claim that the particular funds contained in the r3Q and rPQ accounts (a total of $1,038,172) belonged to Ripple. Rather, Bitstamp knew that Ripple was asserting only that McCaleb had breached a contract with Ripple, and that Ripple might be entitled to damages in the amount of funds paid by Ripple in the transaction.”  Orrick will hear both Ripple’s request for a preliminary injunction and Bitstamp’s request for discharge during a 10th June hearing, according to court documents.  Latest allegations  Recent court filings from both sides suggest that the fight over the disputed funds is far from over, as each was asked to submit a response to Bitstamp’s request to be discharged by 28th May. Bitstamp has until 4th June to submit its own response, according to a recent order by Orrick.  A filing submitted by McCaleb and Stephenson, as well as the Stellar Development Fund, called for the suit to be dismissed by disagreeing with Bitstamp’s request for discharge. The filing alleged a conflict of interest involving Ripple counsel George Frost, who is representing Bitstamp in the case.  Frost acts as counsel for Ripple Labs generally, and is said to be advising Arthur Britto in a different lawsuit against McCaleb over alleged breach of contract.  The defendants also called attention to the relationship between Ripple and Bitstamp.  “Moreover, Ripple and Bitstamp are significantly intertwined. Britto is both a board member of Bitstamp and one of Ripple’s first officers,” the filing reads. “Greg Kidd, an officer of Ripple, is a significant investor in Bitstamp and is financing Britto’s lawsuit. Kidd has also been represented by Frost concerning actions against McCaleb.”  In its own response to Bitstamp’s request for discharge or dismissal, Ripple asserted that the defendants are actively seeking to circumvent the court’s jurisdiction, as well as the order signed by Orrick on 15th May, stating:  “McCaleb, Stephenson, and Stellar (McCaleb’s purported 'foundation') have gone to great lengths to prevent this court from evaluating the merits of this dispute. They want to avoid discovery into their actions at all costs. Their profound aversion to discovery is almost certainly due to the government’s criminal investigations of McCaleb.”  Ripple also asked that the disputed funds, currently held by Bitstamp, be deposited with the court.  At press time, Bitstamp's response to these replies, if submitted, was not available for public viewing. Both Ripple and Bitstamp's requests will be heard at the 10th June hearing next week.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this court case and provide updates as they become available.

Typically, exchanges work off-chain, meaning that user balances are settled within a central database. Bitfinex's bid for greater transparency will allow users to check their segregated bitcoin wallets on the blockchain.  Trade settlements will be broadcast once per day, according to the company.  Zane Tackett, director of community and product development at Bitfinex, said:  ""This represents the next logical step in ensuring the safety of the bitcoin entrusted to us by our users.""  The exchange – which integrated BitGo's multisig technology – recently urged customers to halt deposits following a suspected hack, which is currently being investigated.  When asked if the launch was related to the breach of security, Tackett denied the link, adding that the partnership with BitGo had been in the works for months.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/04/bitfinex-first-bitcoin-exchange-to-offer-on-blockchain-transactions,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42398402,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTRHf,1433436977,KnCMiner Deploys Next-Generation 16nm Bitcoin ASIC,"Swedish mining hardware firm KnCMiner is deploying a new bitcoin ASIC it says will be a ""game changer"" for the industry.  First announced last November, the 16nm Solar is six times faster than the company's previous 28nm design. Unlike conventional 'flat' chips, its components are stacked three-dimensionally to increase efficiency and processing speed.  Sam Cole, KnCMiner's CEO, said in a statement:  ""We've produced four consecutive all-new chip designs in only two years, exceeding even Moore's Law and we see no signs of this development slowing down going forward.""  KnCMiner, which raised a $15m Series B in February, also unveiled details of a new mining facility in Boden, Northern Sweden. The 18,000-sq ft warehouse – roughly the size of four basketball courts – is scheduled to launch this September.  The company said it has earmarked land adjacent to its two flagship data centres, located at a former military base, for future expansion.  All upcoming data centres will run exclusively on the 16nm Solar, Cole told CoinDesk, with all 28nm chips being ""phased out"".  Green concerns  At a time of declining profitability and squeezed margins, efficiency is paramount as mining firms jostle for economies of scale.  KnCMiner's operations in the Arctic Circle use locally-sourced hydroelectric power – Europe's cheapest – alongside sub-zero air to lower the firm's energy footprint and keep costs low.  The company says the ""environmentally friendly"" chip, capable of 0.07 w/GHs, will increase the efficiency of its industrial mining farms by six to eight times.  Despite concerns  about mining centralisation, the firm said its increased hashing power, which will push the overall hashrate higher, will also bolster the network as a whole. Cole told CoinDesk:  ""A higher total hashrate further increases the network's integrity and security. As such, this piece of news should make many bitcoin aficionados worldwide rejoice.""  When the Solar was first announced, the ASIC pioneer suggested it would bolster the consumer hardware and cloud services offered by KnCMiner.  However, in a period marred by shipping delays, customer complaints and a potential class action suit, KnC has been withdrawing from the highly-competitive consumer space to focus on its role as an industrial-scale transaction processor.  All cloud mining contracts are currently listed as ""sold out"" on KnCMiner's site. Cole declined to reveal if contracts would return following a boosted bitcoin price.

42398408,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTRLb,1433431839,Xapo Execs Sued by Former Employer for Contract Breach,"UPDATE (4th June 18:10 BST): The report has been updated with comment from Steven Ragland, the attorney representing Wences Casares.      Several Xapo executives including founder and CEO Wences Casares are being sued for alleged contract violations.  The suit, filed in August 2014 by online identity firm LifeLock, alleges breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty against Casares, president and general counsel Cindy McAdam, and founder and COO Federico Murrone.  Xapo employees Fabian Cuesta and Martin Apesteguia were also identified in the suit, according to a report by Fortune.  LifeLock purchased Lemon, a digital wallet platform, for $42.6m in December 2013. The defendants named in the suit were employees of Lemon at the time it was purchased.  According to the criminal complaint filed by LifeLock, the software underpinning Xapo, as well as related intellectual property, was ""developed by Lemon's employees, in Lemon's facilities, on Lemon's computers, and on Lemon's dime.""  Lemon alleged that it later learned that Xapo's employees included the aforementioned defendants following the publication of a New York Times article on 14 March last year.  The complaint noted:  ""Defendants had not stated the true nature of their relationship with Xapo or the nature and extent of their roles within Xapo (including the extensive design, programming, and other development work that they and other Lemon employees performed), despite the fiduciary duties they owned to Lemon.""  Lemon is seeking damages and remedies has requested a trial by jury.  Following the publication of this article, CoinDesk was contacted by attorney Steven Ragland, who is representing Casares in the lawsuit. In a statement, he called the allegations ""baseless"", arguing:  ""LifeLock has no right to any Bitcoin related business or IP that Wences Casares or his colleagues may have worked on during their time at Lemon or after. As LifeLock's President has attested in a legally binding document, LifeLock does not have any right, claim or interest to any Bitcoin IP. LifeLock's claims lack merit and we look forward to proving their allegations false.""

42398409,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTRNZ,1433416092,Bitcoin Regulation Bill Approved by Californian State Assembly,"California's State Assembly has approved a bill calling for digital currency companies to be regulated in a similar way to banks.  Formulated by Assemblyman Matt Dababneh, chairman of California's Banking and Finance Committee, bill AB-1326 was approved following a 55-22 vote in favour.  Currently undergoing review by California's Senate – having already completed the first of three readings – if passed, the bill would require digital currency businesses to obtain an annually renewable license from the Department of Business Oversight (DBO), unless they are exempt from doing so by the agency.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, license applicants would incur a $5,000 non-refundable registration fee; would be required to complete an application which includes identifying any previous virtual currency services provided by the applicant.  According to California's legislative process, if the bill is approved by the Senate, it will proceed to the state's Governor who can either sign it into law, allow it to become law without a signature or veto it.  A vetoed bill can be overridden by a two thirds vote in both houses. If it does become law, most bills typically come into effect on the first day of January of the following year.  Regulatory pressure  The news comes amid increasing regulatory pressure from state legislators.  Just last month, North Carolina's House of Representatives approved a bill calling for specific digital currency regulation. Similarly to California's bill, House Bill 289 is currently undergoing review in North Carolina's Senate.  Submitted by Republican Representative Stephen M. Ross, who also serves as a vice president and investment officer at Wells Fargo, the bill sets out to enact a new Money Transmitters Act (MTA) to specifically address the transmission of virtual currencies such as bitcoin.

A company blog post cited the Wyoming Division of Banking's recent regulatory legislation as a decisive factor for ceasing business in the western US state, noting it would render continued operations impractical.  ""We understand that the Wyoming Division of Banking interprets the Wyoming Money Transmitter Act to require licensure of entities which offer hosted bitcoin wallet services, and that as a condition of such licensure, licensees must maintain dedicated fiat currency reserves in amount equal to aggregate face value of all bitcoin held on behalf of customers,"" noted the post.  Coinbase  said it would be impractical, costly and inefficient for the company to establish a redundant reserve of fiat currency in equivalent value.
