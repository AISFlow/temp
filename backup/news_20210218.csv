42385954,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPWKl,1613687887,Bermuda to Pilot Digital Dollar for Rum Sales,"In Bermuda, you may soon be able to use digital dollars to buy rum.      Canadian fintech firm Bidali announced Thursday that, with the support of the Bermuda government, it has launched a pilot to test a digital Bermuda dollar. Under the pilot program, popular local rum company Gosling’s Limited will be accepting digital Bermuda dollars through the Stellar network. In other words, people will be able to buy rum with digital dollars.      The pilot is the latest development in Bermuda’s plan to create a comprehensive crypto payments system that uses a digitized version of the Bermuda dollar. The initiative has been underway since 2018, when Bermuda launched its licensing regime for crypto and blockchain fintech firms in the country.      According to the announcement, the first phase of the project will be coordinated by Penrose Partners, a Canadian and Bermudan emerging technology consulting firm.      “With this pilot we’re looking forward to seeing people get hands-on experience with this technology and start to realize the benefits. From there we hope to expand to other businesses in Bermuda,” said Eric Kryski, Bidali’s chief executive.      Denis Pitcher, chief fintech adviser to Premier E. David Burt, explained that Bermuda, a British island territory in the North Atlantic Ocean with a population of around 64,000, does not have a central bank or the necessary expertise to issue the type of government-issued digital currencies countries like China are developing.      Bermuda also does not have access to payment platforms that are typically taken for granted in other countries like PayPal or Square, Pitcher said. Under these conditions, existing crypto systems can help connect Bermudans with the global financial system.      “Our aim is to try and get the Bermuda dollar digitized on every public blockchain. Then, the markets and citizens will figure out what the best solution is,” Pitcher told CoinDesk.      To that end, Bermuda invites fintech firms from all over the world to come experiment and help build a digital payments network in the country.      “What we really resolved to do is to try and attract players to demonstrate their technology on the island,” Pitcher said.      A number of initiatives are already underway. A year after Bermuda launched the blockchain regulatory framework to attract businesses to the country, it started work on a pilot for a blockchain-based digital ID solution.      Since the Bermuda dollar is pegged one-to-one to the U.S. dollar, Pitcher said that it made sense to attract firms that excelled in stablecoin applications. In 2019, the government announced Bermudans could pay taxes with USDC stablecoins, a cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar. USDC is issued by the CENTRE consortium of crypto exchange Coinbase and Circle Pay, a Boston-based company that is one of eight digital assets firms licensed in Bermuda.      In 2020, Bermuda piloted a digital stimulus token to distribute funds to citizens during the coronavirus pandemic. According to Pitcher, the 2020 stimulus token project is dedicated to experimenting with the Liquid network, while the new digital dollar pilot works with the Stellar network.      “There's not going to be one unifying solution that's going to be optimal for every problem. It's more likely to be that there will be different blockchains that will solve different use cases or different problems,” Pitcher said.    ‘Many moving parts’    Although Bermuda is moving forward with the project, Pitcher admits that progress is slow due to a number of challenges.      Integrating payments systems with banks and just getting banks on board has been a challenge, Pitcher explained. Bermuda’s strict licensing regime means companies have to work towards meeting the standards of the country’s financial regulator.      “One of the big challenges we have is, since we have roughly $3 billion in debt, every dollar that flows in basically flows out immediately. So it becomes a management challenge,” Pitcher said.      Despite the various obstacles, Bermuda is forging ahead.      “It's not our position to say which tech is going to solve the problem. It's our position to look at what are the risks and how we make sure they're managed. … Your customers may want to be able to pay in USDC or they may want to pay in a variety of assets. So it's about enabling that kind of choice,” Pitcher said.

42385966,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPWZr,1613684253,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin Steadying Around $52K, Ether Surges on Rising Institutional Interest","Bitcoin hovers around $52,000 as markets wait and see whether the current price level will be held in the next few weeks.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $52,124.59 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.32% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $50,941.99-$52,621.84 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    “Assuming bitcoin remains stable through the course of the next week or so, I will be more comfortable that it shouldn't sell off and we'll move higher,” Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, said.      However, some don’t see a flat market ahead, citing an over-leveraged market.      Darius Sit, co-founder and managing director of Singapore-based quant firm QCP Capital, said corporate buyers and market speculators are supporting bitcoin’s price rally, but that has also caused high funding rates in the derivatives market.      Markets should expect some unwinding of leverage positions in the near term, leading to more price volatility ahead, Sit said.      Read More: Bitcoin Above $52K as Market Expects More Volatility      Borrowing costs aren’t just an issue for crypto, of course. U.S. stocks fell slightly Thursday with a rise in the 10-year Treasury bond yield. Investors appear worried the uptick in rates could halt the current rally across the equities market.      The equities market has benefited from the unprecedented liquidity global central banks pumped into the system since last March, QCP Capital said in its Telegram channel. In order to hedge against inflation, many investors bought bitcoin.      Likewise, if bond yields continue rising sharply and thus damp inflation, it could lead to a bitcoin sell-off.      “'Everyone' is long equities because it’s a free trade from the Federal Reserve,” Swissquote’s Thomas said. “But they will need to change it, and when they do the equity markets will sell off. When equities sell off aggressively, many longs will get stopped out and will be forced to sell. Some will need to sell their bitcoin positions to cover margin calls, and this will drive the crypto markets lower, too.”      “All markets are correlated - and leveraged - and that's dangerous,” Thomas added.      Others, however, remain optimistic on the world’s oldest cryptocurrency.      ""Bitcoin continues to inch closer to a $1 trillion asset and printing fresh all time highs,” Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin, said. “Market sentiment remains bullish and bitcoin adoption is gaining steam across both institutions and retail segments.”      On the institution side, money manager BlackRock announced it has started “to dabble” in cryptocurrencies, and MicroStrategy is preparing for another bitcoin purchase, according to Lau. On the retail side, the number of wallets with less than $1,000 of bitcoin is growing significantly.      According to data from Glassnode, the number of addresses with non-zero bitcoin balance is now more than 35 million as of Wednesday.      Breaking the $1 trillion market capitalization mark would have a deep meaning to bitcoin as an asset class, according to mining pool F2Pool’s co-founder, Shixing “Discus Fish” Mao.      “Bitcoin has surpassed Alibaba, Tesla and Tencent [by market capitalization] and only five companies and two precious metals can compete with bitcoin,” Mao said.    Ether follows bitcoin, surging on institution interest, DeFi and NFTs    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Thursday, trading around $1,941.71 and climbing 5.77% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Some said ether’s latest rally was triggered by increased institutional interest.      “Since Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) just bought over 197,890 ETH worth $344 million on behalf of its investors in a span of two weeks, we are witnessing an influx of investments in ether only a few months after bitcoin’s institutional influx,” F2Pool’s Mao told CoinDesk.      Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.      Meanwhile, similar to bitcoin, there have been growing concerns around the overheated derivatives market on ether. Analysts warn the market should expect higher volatility in the near term.      Read More: Ether Looks Overleveraged as Cryptocurrency Hits New High Over $1,900      The growth in the decentralized finance sector, which is largely built on top of Ethereum blockchain, continues after the total value locked in DeFi dropped in the past week, according to data from DeFi Pulse.      The total value locked in DeFi currently stands at $41.8 billion, more than doubled from the beginning of this year.      “Ether approaching $2,000 could be seen as validation of all the dapps and use cases that have blossomed over the years - from DeFi to NFTs,” OKCoin’s Lau said, referring to nonfungible tokens. “It is also benefiting strongly from bitcoin's increased adoption. The ratio of ether to bitcoin remains at 2%-4%, a range that has persisted since September 2018.”      Read More: Blockchain Bites: Why Buy an NFT?

Fidelity Charitable's ""2021 Giving Report,"" released Wednesday, reveals crypto donations made up only a tiny fraction of the $1.6 billion in so-called ""non-publicly traded assets"" amassed during 2020.  The 2020 crypto totals beat 2019's tally of $13 million, but the amount fell short of 2018's $30 million and was well below the record $69 million haul Fidelity Charitable brought in 2017.

42385962,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBPWTZ,1613675551,PancakeSwap Brings Whopping DeFi Volumes to Binance Smart Chain,"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right?      Competing decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are trading blows in the world of open-source software as rivals to Ethereum-based Uniswap are catching up to the unicorn project in terms of volume and nominal liquidity.      Leading the charge is PancakeSwap. The automated market maker (AMM) clone of Uniswap on Binance’s own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), has seen liquidity grow 1,003% for the year to date. Volumes have been a tad more impressive, up 2,800% from $37 million on Jan. 1 to $1.1 billion on Feb. 17, according to CoinGecko.      Its native CAKE token has shot up some 6,000% since its release last fall and is now trading hands at $12.77, per CoinGecko data.    BNB booster?    Binance’s native token, BNB, is also reaping rewards from the newfound attention on BSC. BNB broke into crypto’s top five coins by market capitalization at $191 per token Thursday after gaining 13% in 24 hours, according to Messari. The token is needed to process transactions on BSC, similarly to ether (ETH) on Ethereum.      Ostensibly, value moving over to BSC reflects demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) products on the cheap. The cost to process a simple Uniswap transfer has skyrocketed well into the double digits in line with ETH’s bull run. Even a simple transfer from one wallet to another will set you back nearly $10. Gas fees are likely a major factor in traders moving to other chains with cloned DeFi offerings.    Read more: Binance CEO Says He Fully Expects DeFi to Cannibalize His Crypto Exchange    Not to be left out is original Uniswap knockoff SushiSwap, which has enjoyed increased volume and liquidity figures during the DeFi market’s second act. CoinGecko lists the DEX as the third-largest AMM after Uniswap and PancakeSwap, respectively.      SushiSwap – a clone of Uniswap launched in August 2020 through a novel financial incentive program called “vampire mining” – has liquidity roughly 25% lower than that of Uniswap, although overall trade volume remains around 65% lower at $358 million.",POSITIVE,BNB | CAKE,EXCHANGE | MARKET | UNI | BNB | CAKE,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/18/pancakeswap-brings-whopping-defi-volumes-to-binance-smart-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/572a9679f240333abb6df1112bbdcafee2816f00-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405936,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepPpj,1613669572,The Bull Case for DeFi: Matthew Roszak,"Yield bugs “People are building treadmills for capital,” billionaire venture capitalist Matthew Roszak said on CoinDesk TV this morning. The founder of Bloq, a blockchain enterprise software company, predicts the growing world of decentralized finance (DeFi), currently valued at $40 billion, could “add another zero in a year from today.”      “The innovation cycle in DeFi is happening in real time,” Roszak said. Most notably is the yield opportunities presented across the DeFi stack. While institutions haven’t yet plowed funds into “yield farms,” typically named after foods like Yams, Pickles or Sushi, there is a “macro need” for returns on capital. Right now that value is accruing to early adopters.    This article is excerpted from Blockchain Bites, a daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    But what would it take for legacy institutions to take a jog on the DeFi capital treadmill? A comparable level of risk might be found in corporate junk bonds. Given the historically low rates on U.S. Treasury bonds and typically safer investments, traders are putting funds in higher risk, higher reward junk bonds. In fact, the demand for this debt has actually pushed junk bond yields to historic lows. (Bond prices and yields are inversely correlated, as demand pushes a bond’s price up, yields fall.)      The measure for the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate High-Yield index dipped to 3.96% in early February. MarketAxess Holdings President and Chief Operating Officer Chris Concannon said yesterday on Bloomberg that electronic high-yield bond trading is booming. In essence it just comes down to what opportunities are available.      Right now, many institutions are probably aware of the opportunities present in DeFi – the U.S. Federal Reserve has certainly taken note – but may be hesitant to jump into a sector known that is still working out its kinks.      Roszak noted there’s technology risk – in terms of bugs, of which there have been many – as well as adoption risk – related to who is joining the market and user experience issues. But the new capital markets are real and they’re here to stay. “As the lens the market starts to look through is going to get more and more refined as best practices on how to score risk start to get unpacked,” Roszak said.      As Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, one of the members of the CENTRE Consortium that issues a key DeFi stablecoin, USDC, put it: “People are starting to realize how profound this new infrastructure for the internet is.”    Other stories    Data dot: Are banks playing with small-cap crypto? Goldman Sachs, ICAP, JPMorgan and UBS have invested in a financial product that tracks Polkadot’s cryptocurrency, DOT, the fifth-largest digital asset by market cap. These banks and brokerages purchased small amounts of shares in Switzerland-based 21Shares’ exchange-traded product, according to Bloomberg data. Major institutions have a growing appetite for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), which may also be extending into lower-capped coins as the market rally continues. Maybe they claimed their POOL airdrop?      Bull and bear case for ETH Ether continues to set new lifetime highs as it charts a course to $2,000. CoinDesk markets reporter Omkar Godbole looks at signs the cryptocurrency may be overleveraged in the derivatives market and heading towards a patch of volatility. That said, other indicators show ETH could continue to climb – coins are leaving exchanges and the number of active addresses is increasing.      Mining mania Nasdaq-listed Ebang will start mining bitcoins using its own machines and competing brands. There’s something of a tried and true method for mining manufacturers to turn on their own rigs or invest in mining pools, though these operations often run into problems during market downturns.

As it moves between $51,000 and $52,000, traders are preparing for more volatility in the near term.      “Markets look relatively bullish for the medium run,” Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier, told CoinDesk. “A number of technical indicators at the shorter time frames say that things are going to temporarily top out before heading back up.”      Yet, Darius Sit, co-founder and managing director of Singapore-based QCP Capital, warned that while corporate buyers and speculators have pushed bitcoin’s price to multiple all-time highs this week, the market is also currently over-leveraged and can thus expect short-term volatility.      Data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows that the average level of the “funding rate” across major exchanges offering bitcoin perpetuals (futures with no expiry) has risen sharply to 0.125%, a level that has not seen since February 2020.      “Given how expensive it is to keep leverage long now, it would possibly see some unwinding of leverage,” Sit said.      Read more: Ether Looks Overleveraged as Cryptocurrency Hits New High Over $1,900      The funding rate of perpetuals is calculated every eight hours and represents the cost of holding long positions. When perpetuals trade at a premium to spot price, the funding rate is positive, meaning longs pay shorts. Thus a high level of funding rate is considered a sign of leverage being excessively skewed to the bullish side – markets are overbought – and often adds volatility to the market.

42405921,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepPdv,1613663259,What Happens if All Stablecoin Users Have to Be Identified?,"Imagine the following scenario: Sometime in 2021, financial regulators declare that all stablecoin owners must be verified. What would happen to the cryptocurrency ecosystem?      Right now, a large chunk of stablecoin usage is pseudonymous. That is, you or I can hold $20,000 worth of tether or USD coin stablecoins in an unhosted wallet (i.e., not on an exchange) without having to provide our identities to either Tether or Circle, the managers of these stablecoin platforms. We can send this $20,000 along to other users, who can transfer the coins on, who in turn can transfer them on, and no one along this chain needs to unveil themselves.    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    The only point at which stablecoin users have to submit to a Tether or Circle know-your-customer (KYC) process is to redeem stablecoins directly for traditional bank dollars. Or vice versa, to deposit dollars with Tether or Circle and get freshly minted stablecoins.      In a world where traditional non-blockchain based financial institutions like PayPal, Chase, and Zelle link all payments to names and addresses, stablecoin networks have become a rare moat of digital payments privacy. This has led to some fairly exotic uses for stablecoins.      In Moscow, Chinese gray market clothes vendors trade cash for tether to repatriate profits, writes CoinDesk's Anna Baydakova. Ukrainian companies that import from Turkey use tether to skirt foreign exchange controls, and a multi-million Ponzi scheme relied on Paxos standard (PAX) for payments. Meanwhile, in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), unidentifiable computer programs are conducting billions of dollars in unregulated financial transactions using USD coin and other stablecoins.      But will regulators allow this privacy moat to continue to exist? What if, at this very moment, officials working for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S. Treasury's money laundering watchdog, are plotting how to rein in stablecoin pseudonymity?      See also: What Are Stablecoins?      Let me speculate about how a potential unveiling might look.      FinCEN could rule that henceforth, if anyone wants to access tether, USD coin, or any other official stablecoin (TrueUSD, Paxos standard, Gemini dollar, Binance USD, HUSD) they will need to apply for a verified stablecoin account. That would mean providing photo ID, proof of address and other information to Tether, Circle or other issuers.      For many existing stablecoin owners, this won't be a big deal. Professional arbitrageurs who use stablecoins to move value from one centralized exchange to another are probably already KYC'd. And retail clients who keep their stablecoins on an exchange like Binance wouldn't see any changes because the exchange already verifies their identities anyways.      But given that every transfer would need to have names and addresses associated with it, an unveiling would certainly weigh on gray market uses such as the Chinese traders in Moscow.    With stablecoins getting bigger by the day, regulators probably can't ignore the issue of pseudonymity forever.    The issuers themselves would be inconvenienced, too. Building infrastructure to collect and verify the identity of all users, and not just the few who redeem or deposit, is expensive. To recoup their costs, issuers like Tether and Circle may consider introducing fees. All of this could render stablecoins less accessible for people who only want to use them for casual remittances.      It is in the world of DeFi that the fallout of a stablecoin unveiling could be felt the most. Real people who own stablecoins can be easily identified. But in DeFi, stablecoins are often deposited into accounts controlled by bits of autonomous code, or smart contracts, which don't have any underlying owner. It’s not evident how a stablecoin issuer can conduct KYC on a smart contract.      Maker, one of the most popular decentralized tools, contains $350 million USD coins in various user-created vaults. This hoard of stablecoins serves as collateral backing for dai, Maker's decentralized stablecoin. Another $130 million USD coin is held in a Maker’s peg stability module smart contract. If all stablecoin owners must be identified, it’s not apparent who or what entity would have to undergo a KYC check for this $130 million.      Compound, another popular DeFi tool, currently holds $1.6 billion USD coin and $350 million tether. Lenders can deposit their stablecoins into Compound smart contracts and collect interest from borrowers who draw from the contracts.      Liquidity pools, smart contracts underpinning decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Curve, also hold large amounts of stablecoins. Curve liquidity pools currently contain $1.25 billion worth USD coin and $450 million worth of tether.      See also: JP Koning - What Tether Means When It Says It’s ‘Regulated’      Under the strictest scenario, stablecoin issuers could be required to cut off any entity that can't provide a verified name or address. Which means Curve, Maker, and Compound smart contracts would all be prevented from receiving stablecoins.      Given the ecosystem’s reliance on stablecoins, this would come close to breaking it. Compound, Curve and Uniswap might try to adapt by substituting FinCEN compliant stablecoins like USD coin with decentralized ones, say like Maker's dai stablecoin. Because decentralized stablecoins don't rely on traditional banks, they are less beholden to FinCEN dictat.      But remember, Maker relies on USD coin collateral to imbue dai with stability. If Maker, like Compound and Curve, can no longer hold USD coin, then dai itself would become less stable. And so the usability of Compound and other protocols relying on dai would suffer.      If we imagine a more dovish scenario, FinCEN might allow for a smart contract exemption. As long as stablecoins are held in a smart contract rather than an externally controlled account, then FinCEN would allow the stablecoin issuer to provide financial services to the smart contract. Much of DeFi could continue on as before.      This option provides a pretty big loophole for bad actors, though. The whole reason for requiring platforms to verify accounts is to prevent them moving illicit funds. If stablecoins held in smart contracts are exempt from KYC obligations, then enterprising individuals will move stablecoins to the smart contract layer and thus stimie FinCEN controls.      See also: Questions About Tether Just Won’t Go Away. Does the Crypto Market Care?      A middle-of-the-road scenario is that FinCEN exempts smart contracts from stablecoin KYC, but only if the smart contract itself verifies the identities of all addresses that interact with the contract. So Curve, in this case, would have to set up a customer due diligence program if it wanted to qualify to use stablecoins. Maker would have to vet all vault owners.      Under this scenario, we could imagine DeFi splitting into two. Purely decentralized protocols would avoid stablecoins altogether to avoid subjecting their users to KYC. Not-so-decentralized finance would start to verify users to maintain access to stablecoins.      There are many other potential scenarios. As you can see, this is a complex problem. If FinCEN is indeed exploring the question of stablecoin pseudonymity, I wouldn't want to be the official tasked with trying to design an appropriate response. Too strict and DeFi may no longer function. Too light and DeFi will continue to pose a money laundering threat.      But the clock is ticking. The combination of tether, USD coin, Paxos standard, Binance USD, TrueUSD, dai, and HUSD now regularly surpasses bitcoin in terms of on-chain volume. In January 2021, these stablecoins processed $308 billion in transactions compared to bitcoin's $297 billion. With stablecoins getting bigger by the day, regulators probably can't ignore the issue of pseudonymity forever.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDT | BNB,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/02/18/what-happens-if-all-stablecoin-users-have-to-be-identified,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f13094c74ee14655f097b7b4bff755c2b42402d1-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405913,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepPZ0,1613663103,BitPay to Pay $500K to Settle OFAC Sanction Violation Charges,"Crypto payments platform BitPay has settled with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on charges of over 2,000 apparent sanctions violations.      According to an enforcement notice published on Feb. 18, BitPay will pay $507,375 on allegations it allowed individuals in sanctioned locations like Ukraine's Crimea region, Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, Iran and Syria to transact with people in the U.S., in apparent violation of U.S. sanctions law. Roughly $129,000 in cryptocurrencies were transacted between 2013 and 2018.      The company knew it was facilitating transactions for individuals in sanctioned regions because it had location information and IP addresses, OFAC claimed.      Under the charges, BitPay could have faced a maximum fine of over $600 million, but OFAC took into consideration some mitigating factors, the enforcement notice said. These include that BitPay implemented compliance controls, employee training, launched an identification service, blocked IP addresses in sanctioned regions and took a number of other steps to prevent it from facilitating such transactions in future. BitPay cooperated with OFAC as the agency investigated the charges.      ""BitPay failed to exercise due caution or care for its sanctions compliance obligations when it allowed persons in sanctioned jurisdictions to transact with BitPay’s merchants using digital currency for approximately five years, even though BitPay had sufficient information to screen those customers,"" the notice said.      The notice warned that cryptocurrency companies must abide by OFAC regulations and monitor for possible sanctions risks. The Treasury Department watchdog has published a framework for companies to use as part of that mission.      Read more: Payments Provider BitPay Rolls Out Cryptocurrency Payroll Service      ""Companies that facilitate or engage in online commerce or process transactions using digital currency are responsible for ensuring that they do not engage in unauthorized transactions prohibited by OFAC sanctions, such as dealings with blocked persons or property, or engaging in prohibited trade or investment-related transactions,"" the notice said.      In a statement, a BiPay spokesperson said, ""We cooperated fully with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and are pleased to have resolved this matter. The settlement involved a very small number of transactions (2,102) that occurred between our merchants and their customers from 2013 to 2018, that appear to have originated from sanctioned jurisdictions. These transactions had an average value of less than $100, totaling $128,582.61, and involved industries such as online hosting services and gaming. OFAC found the violations to be non-egregious.""      The transactions account for 0.04% of the total transactions conducted in that time period, and the company has since improved its compliance program, the spokesperson said.

42405933,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepPmm,1613660413,Libra Co-Creator's VC Firm Co-Leads $12M Round in ‘Decentralized GitHub’,"In retrospect, it was inevitable: A team of blockchain developers has replaced GitHub with a decentralized system for collaborating on open source software. There’s even a decentralized finance (DeFi) twist.      Announced Thursday, Radicle, a fully decentralized code repository, has raised $12 million in funding, integrated its peer-to-peer network with Ethereum and launched the RAD governance token.      The funding round was led by NFX and Galaxy, with participation from Placeholder, Electric Capital and ParaFi Capital; Naval Ravikant, Balaji Srinivasan and Meltem Demirors were also involved. Notably, it’s the first crypto investment from NFX since Libra co-creator Morgan Beller left Facebook and joined the VC firm in September 2020.      The growing army of “Web 3.0” builders are mismatched with centralized platforms like Microsoft-owned GitHub, said Eleftherios Diakomichalis, co-founder of Radicle. The needs of these communities are better served by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) controlling their code repositories, rather than hierarchical platforms with one admin in control, he said.      “We think about Radicle as infrastructure for decentralized communities,” Diakomichalis said in an interview. “When it comes to value, these communities are very used to interacting with value flows; think about things like DeFi protocols on Ethereum. So we are bringing these two worlds closer together – the code collaboration world with the world of DAOs – and this new financial infrastructure is being built on Ethereum.”      NFX’s Beller said the existing situation – Web 3 developers building under the possibility of Web 2 censorship – “makes very little sense.”      “It's impossible to decentralize code ownership, which is kind of ironic when you compare this to Web 3 development,” Beller told CoinDesk in an interview. “Imagine the U.S. government, or any government, wants a repo to be taken down? It can go to Microsoft and say, ‘Take it down.’”    DeFi treasuries    There's a pattern among community-owned networks like Uniswap and Compound, Diakomichalis pointed out. All of them have some kind of treasury, some with as much as 50% of the network translating into billions of dollars.      “All these networks are looking to incentivize developer activity around their code bases, such as with Uniswap’s grants program,” said Diakomichalis. “We see Radicle as a way users can start off with our decentralized protocol for controlling repos and then explore other funding-related protocols.”    Read more: BitcoinACKs Lets You Track Bitcoin Development and Pay Coders for Their Work    Radicle is creating a function called “Token Streams” that allows any user to create curated registries of resources (Vitalik Buterin’s list of the best Eth 2.0 researchers, for example) and then start streaming funds to those resources. There will also be smart contracts to pay for particular coding targets and milestones, with lots of flexibility, checks and balances and so on, Diakomichalis said.      It should be said that GitHub introduced a system of code sponsoring back in May 2019, which operates like Patreon.      “It’s interesting that GitHub understands the power of this and wants to play there, but they have this kind of old-school, Web 2.0 angle, like now they keep 10% of every transaction that passes through GitHub Sponsors,” said Diakomichalis. “Of course, they are also the trusted gatekeeper.

Gundlach – CEO of DoubleLine Capital, an investment firm with more than $130 billion in assets under management – now says bitcoin could be a better bet than gold.      Gundlach, who's previously said, ""I don't believe in bitcoin,"" tweeted Thursday that ""bitcoin may be the stimulus asset. It doesn't look like gold is.""      Gundlach's change of stance comes on the heels of bitcoin's dizzying rise from $10,000 to $52,000 seen in the past 4.5 months.      The cryptocurrency has charted a 10-fold rally in the past 11 months, offering a significantly higher return than gold amid the massive inflation-boosting monetary and fiscal stimulus delivered by authorities worldwide to counter the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown. The precious metal reached a record high of $2,075 in August 2020 and has been trending lower ever since.      Gundlach noted he had been neutral on gold for the last six months, while formerly a ""gold bull."" He previously said bitcoin was in ""bubble territory"" when it rose past $23,000 in early January.

42405927,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepPhr,1613656800,‘Evil VASP’ Simulation Preps Crypto Exchanges for FATF Travel Rule,"Getting crypto exchanges across the world to plug into each other and share sensitive customer data is proving to be a complex problem.      Nonetheless, firms have to show real progress on this by June of this year, according to new anti-money laundering (AML) rules from global AML watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).      Announced Thursday, the Travel Rule Information Sharing Alliance (TRISA), one of the better-known solutions being proposed, is launching a testnet that includes a directory of virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and scenario testing for inevitable contact with non-compliant firms.      The FATF rules require crypto companies to share personally identifiable information (PII) for transactions over a certain amount. While a global cohort of compliance-minded exchanges will begin implementing the new rules later this year, there will be many stragglers including smaller firms in far-flung jurisdictions. This is expected to create a so-called “sunrise problem,” as some parts of the crypto world become regulated ahead of others.      The TRISA testnet begins to address that looming challenge by including a dummy version of an “evil VASP” that will provide false authentication, attempt to steal data and so on.      There are two compliant VASPs as well as the non-compliant exchange on the testnet, explained John Jefferies, co-chairman of TRISA.      “The evil VASP isn't part of TRISA and it will try and trick people into sharing information,” said Jefferies. “So what we are building out gives firms the opportunity to test out domains and do interoperability testing from a security dimension and messaging dimension.”    Read more: Crypto Firms Establish Messaging Standard to Deal With FATF Travel Rule    TRISA is backed by blockchain analytics company CipherTrace and has support from the likes of Paxful’s Lana Schwartzman, Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP attorney Carol Van Cleef, and Thomas Hardjono of MIT Connection Science & Engineering.      The solution leverages battle-tested certificate authority infrastructure that allows VASPs to mutually authenticate one another, Jefferies explained. Post-testnet, TRISA will be issuing know-your-VASP certificates, validated by a registration authority.      “The cool thing about having a proper certificate authority is that it has the concept of revocation,” said Jefferies. “So if a VASP turns evil – say they pull some sort of exit or fraud or their licenses are revoked – that public key infrastructure that sets up the relationship can also take it back if the whole community has to stop communicating with a VASP, at least for a little while.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/02/18/evil-vasp-simulation-preps-crypto-exchanges-for-fatf-travel-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/507868a67b7aa0f625799ae5018f1832e9467ed7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Most institutions favor a two-level model for a digital ruble in which banks open wallets on clients' behalf on the central bank's platform, Bank of Russia chair Elvira Nabiullina said Thursday, according to an RT report.  Discussions around the creation of a state-backed digital currency started in October, but concerns were raised by commercial banks that liquidity could be drained from their balance sheets as a result.

Launching and testing a special platform would be the next step, according to RT's report.  While the Bank of Russia is pushing on with its own digital currency plans, public crypto assets are set to be ruled out as a legal means of payment.

42405929,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepPko,1613654719,"No, Bitcoin Is Nothing Like the South Sea Bubble","Every asset that moves fast attracts the B-word.      But what the last few decades of research in finance has taught us is that it’s not so easy to spot financial bubbles, at least not until after they collapse. The very fact that we don’t have “successful” bubbles tells us that our definition of bubbles is backward-looking, excluding once-lofty assets that actually made it.    Joakim Book is a research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research and a writer on all things money and financial history. He holds degrees in economics and economic history from the University of Glasgow and the University of Oxford.    The Teslas of the world (and the Squares and the Apples and the Nvidias) all have parabolic price rises with valuations that cannot reasonably be justified by our traditional investing tools. Gold has allegedly been a bubble for 6,000 years, making a grand mockery of the meaning of the word. At some point, a “bubbling” new venture turns into something else: a valuable asset.      Where does that leave bitcoin?      BTC is routinely slapped with the B-word and skeptics have called for its imminent death hundreds of times. What goes up, standard reasoning suggests, must come down – especially if we can’t see an overwhelmingly clear reason for why it should rise. Critics are quick to invoke the South Sea Bubble of 1720 or the Tulip bubble in 1637, but it’s not clear they know enough about our financial past to make those episodes relevant for today.      It’s easy to see why comparing bitcoin to the South Sea Company’s meteoric rise in the spring and summer of 1720 is so tempting. Here is a chart tracking the price of bitcoin and SSC’s stock:      While bubbles of the past explode only to later collapse and never to return to their previous glory, bitcoin is known for its “two-steps-forward-one-step-back” moves. If I plot its latest seven-month explosion from around $10,000 to over $50,000 against the relevant time period for the South Sea Company’s stock in 1719-1720, we realize what the bitcoin skeptics think they see – an unsustainable bubble waiting to deflate.      But they shouldn’t be too hasty. Bitcoin of 2021 doesn’t have an entrenched political elite trying to consolidate and make manageable a bloated government debt. If anything, Bitcoin is fighting elites that are trying to oppose it and denounce it every step of the way. While exchanges have been hacked and privacy details leaked, bitcoin insiders haven’t unscrupulously bribed half the House of Commons with assets sold at below market-price. Bitcoin insiders haven’t – as far as we know – assuaged government officials by giving them fictitious bitcoin in exchange for favorable legislation. This all happened during South Sea mania.      Political insiders haven't passed a “Bubble Act” to ban the issuance of other competing schemes to funnel market demand to their preferred asset. Spot trading of bitcoin hasn’t been paused for two months at the height of a price boom to process a dividend the SSC directors haphazardly arranged so a semblance of fundamental value could be had.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: No, Bitcoin Is Not in a Bubble      New bitcoins are predictably mined and willingly sold in open and relatively transparent markets. In the case of the SSC, the company issued new shares in rounds of higher and higher subscription prices with ever-loftier promises of future riches.      Bitcoins aren't purchased on a partially paid payment plan where investors put down 10% or 20% of issuing price with the rest payable in equal installments every three or four months – essentially transforming the stock into a levered derivative product. If anything, bitcoin is purchased with investor equity or with over-collateralized loans.      The Bitcoin network is not extending loans to its “investors” or allowing its directors to lend aggressively on the security of their holdings. While crypto banks today do offer lending services, they are well-capitalized and their loans are made with plenty of collateral. This damps the risk to the overall financial system rather than fueling the fire like the South Sea directors did in the spring and summer of 1720.      Bitcoin’s 2021 looks nothing like the South Sea Company in 1720. Is this time different?      Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital contemplates this: Perhaps periods of technological network effects and aggressive central banks truly are different from the past we thought we knew. Other long-standing crypto critics like Ray Dalio have recently said they might have been wrong on bitcoin. Many others have come to terms with what the first cryptocurrency offers such as the historian Niall Ferguson or investor Stanley Druckenmiller.      See also: Yanhao Max Wei - Bubbles Are Good for Bitcoin      If bitcoin is indeed a bubble waiting to collapse, it is unlike many of the iconic historical bubbles we know. The go-to references make less and less sense: the scant trades of extraordinary tulips weren’t much of a mania, trading without money changing hands while the bulbs were still in the ground in the winter of 1637. The success of the dot-com “bubble,” while having only minor impacts on the real economy, laid the ground for the flourishing e-commerce that we now enjoy.      What financial historians have found is crashes that involve plenty of bank leverage, like the U.S. subprime collapse in 2007-2008, are the really damaging panics to look out for. The ones that are mostly equity-financed and bring new technologies – like the dot-com mania in the 1990s and the British bicycle mania a century before – are much less of a worry.      Even if the detractors are right, and bitcoin is to follow the path laid out by the South Sea Company 300 years ago, it’s not clear that we should be alarmed. Crying “bubble” is simple; financial history is hard. “Historians have no great powers of foresight,” D’Maris Coffman of University College London eloquently points out. But we do know a thing or two about people in the present misusing the past. And no, bitcoin has very little in common with these great bubbles of the past.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Joakim Book,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/18/no-bitcoin-is-nothing-like-the-south-sea-bubble,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/39899498b1ac7588be7e6d78506ce069a7b34a20-1420x958.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405941,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAepPqi,1613644469,"Ether Looks Overleveraged as Cryptocurrency Hits New High Over $1,900","Ether (ETH) soared to new record highs Thursday, but an overheated derivatives market may suggest higher volatility is on the way for the short term.      The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value set the new lifetime high of $1,928 soon before press time, having first breached the previous peak of $1,821.49 reached on Feb. 13 early today, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      In the derivatives market, the average level of the ""funding rate"" across major exchanges offering ether perpetuals (futures with no expiry) has risen sharply from 0.069% – just short of the early January record high of 0.21%, according to data source Glassnode.      ""It shows the derivatives market is overleveraged,"" Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, told CoinDesk. ""With this current structure, I do not feel comfortable in running a lot of long exposure.""      The funding rate is calculated every eight hours and represents the cost of holding long positions. When perpetuals trade at a premium to spot price, the funding rate is positive (longs pay shorts). Hence, a very high funding rate is considered a sign of leverage being excessively skewed to the bullish side (overbought conditions) and often injects volatility into the market.      In such situations, holding longs at high costs is attractive only if the bullish momentum remains strong. A pullback or consolidation can trigger an unwinding of longs, leading to a more profound price drop and a pick-up in price volatility. As of press time, ether is showing no signs of price congestion.      However, the case for a continued steep rally looks weak, with spot market volumes falling on major exchanges such as Coinbase.      With the 10-day moving average of daily volume trending south, there's a question mark on the sustainability of recent gains. A low-volume price rise is often short-lived.      That said, a pullback, if any, could be shallow and brief, as on-chain fundamentals are biased bullish.      The number of coins held on exchanges has declined by 10% to 20.77 million in the past three months, according to data source CryptoQuant. It shows investors are either taking direct custody of coins or staking them into decentralized finance protocols, creating a sell-side liquidity shortage.      ""In the long-run, [the] ETH rally would keep going as long as ETH holdings in all exchanges are decreasing,"" Ki-Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk.      Other metrics also paint a bullish picture. For instance, the 90-day average of active addresses on Ethereum's network has increased to a new lifetime high of around 450,000, surpassing the 2017 peak, according to Glassnode.      ""When there’s greater usage, there’s more demand for the cryptocurrency, and that drives the price up,” Philip Gradwell, chief economist at the blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis, told CoinDesk.

Currently, traders can only buy and sell crypto assets within the app, according to its support page.

Robinhood stated in the tweet that it ""does not currently invest in cryptocurrency or use any customer cryptocurrency"" for its own benefit.      The popular mobile trading platform has been under fire recently after it limited its users' ability to buy cryptocurrencies and certain volatile securities, including GameStop stock, last month.

The firm, which has bases in Switzerland and Singapore, said the fundraising effort will have brought in investment of around $30 million over the past six months, helping the firm grow its assets under administration, which stood at over $500 million as of January 2021.      Coming as the company prepares for a possible public offering, the capital raised will also go toward increasing Sygnum’s range of custody offerings, commercializing its tokenization platform and secondary market trading facility, as well as expanding its open banking API infrastructure.

42433646,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP03jh,1613606400,US Lawmakers Looking Into China’s Role in GameStop Pump: Report,"U.S. lawmakers are set to question a trader named Keith Gill and the chief executives of Reddit and Robinhood about their roles in the GameStop frenzy at a congressional hearing later this week. But some have another concern: whether China is involved.      Several Republican lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee plan to examine Reddit’s ties to Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent and Robinhood rival Moomoo, according to a Politico report. Moomoo is a wholly owned subsidiary of Futu Holdings, which is also backed by Tencent.      These Republicans are reportedly concerned about possible manipulation by the Chinese companies in the inflating of GameStop’s stock through the trading app Robinhood and some Reddit day traders.      It is unclear from the report why these lawmakers want to investigate these Chinese companies and what specific questions they plan to ask during the hearing, which takes place Thursday, according to the announcement by Rep. Maxine Waters, (D-Calif.), who chairs the committee.      However, the GameStop hearing comes at a time when techno nationalism is running high in the U.S. and China. Policymakers have imposed – or tried to impose – restrictions that accelerate the decoupling of digital platforms, supply chains and knowledge networks.      “We are living in a time of increased competition between Chinese tech and so-called western tech,” said James Cooper, an associate dean at California Western School of Law, who served as consultant to the U.S. Department of State, advising on emerging technologies.      He said investigating whether malicious Chinese actors manipulated GameStop’s price is “political theater.” Tencent and Moomoo did not respond to requests for comments as of press time.    China focus    Political theater aside, there may be a few reasons these lawmakers are looking at China. One is the possibility of Chinese retail investors’ eagerness to jump into the GameStop stock frenzy. The other is the continuing influence of Chinese-owned trading apps in the U.S.      China has some 167 million retail investors who hold over 28.5% total market value of the Chinese stock market (approximately $200 billion). Chinese retail investors are able to trade GameStop stock via Chinese online brokerage platforms with U.S. broker licenses, such as Moomoo and Webull. Both Moomoo and Webull, which are major Robinhood rivals in the U.S., are founded by former employees of Tencent and Alibaba, respectively.      Webull became the second most popular app in the U.S. around the time when online brokerages were restricted from buying GameStop and AMC Entertainment stocks. Both Webull and Moomoo have become alternative platforms for retail investors as Robinhood grapples with backlash caused by its trading restrictions.      Webull began offering trading services for cryptocurrencies in 2020. Over the last year it had a ten-fold increase in brokerage clients to more than 2 million users. While its current user base pales in comparison to Robinhood’s 13 million, Webull said it has been peeling off users from its rival, according to a report by Bloomberg Businessweek.      Read More: TikTok and the Great Firewall of America      Retail investors appeared to have turned to Webull after Robinhood halted the trading of certain stocks that were being pumped by the Reddit group, including GameStop. However, Webull later ceased such transactions, claiming its clearing firm told it to stop opening new positions in certain stocks.      The lawmakers’ concerns about Reddit’s ties with Tencent may stem from a $300 million Series D funding round in February 2019, when the Chinese company invested $150 million as the lead investor.      Tencent’s funding soon drew criticism from Reddit's users who prioritize privacy and decried censorship. However, some analysts believe it is unlikely Tencent would be able to control content on the platform.    Robinhood's rivals    San Francisco-based Moomoo is part of Futu Inc.’s efforts to expand its businesses in the U.S. atop Futu’s success in mainland China. Founded by Hua Li, who was one of Tencent’s earliest employees in 2012, Futu is one of the largest online brokerage platforms in China, and lets retail users in mainland China trade Hong Kong- and U.S.-listed stocks.      Futu Inc. is a broker-dealer registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is a member of both the Financial Industry Regulatory Association and the Securities Insurance Protection Corporation (SIPC), according to a statement on its website.      Futu scored one of the biggest Asian initial public offerings of 2019 on Nasdaq and aims to be a major player in online brokerage services for retail investors across the world.      Li holds 40.2% of Futu’s equity with over 71% voting power, while Tencent owns 30.3% of the firm’s shares with 26.2% voting power, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated April 27, 2020.      Webull is a subsidiary of Fumi Technology, which was founded in 2016 by Alibaba alum Anquan Wang in Hunan, China.      Webull complies with the same regulations as any other U.S. brokerage and stores user data locally, with an office in lower Manhattan, according to the Bloomberg report.      Webull has voluntarily sought a review of its ownership by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (Cfius), a panel that tends to prevent some Chinese-owned companies from expanding in the U.S. for national security reasons, the firm’s chief executive, Anthony Denier, said in the report.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/02/18/us-lawmakers-looking-into-chinas-role-in-gamestop-pump-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fd005b347b5071704e2e8b4d27cd925ae77b8af-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
