The digital asset which has been having a reasonably good run over the last few weeks is expected to shatter expectations as the analyst puts the price at $35. Crypto Analyst Predicts 8800% Climb To $35 For ADA Fiery Trading’s latest Cardano (ADA) prediction right be one of the most bullish for the digital asset this year. ADA, the native token of the Cardano network, is currently trading at $0.388 and if the crypto analyst’s prediction proves true, then it’ll be an 8,800% rise to $35. Related Reading: Top 5 Meme Coins That Are Outperforming The Altcoin Rally The analyst presents the argument that ADA had already bottomed out last month and this is why the price has been in an uptrend. They place the bottom for the price downtrend at the bottom support of the parallel channel which happened right before the price recovery started. Source: Tradingview.com As the analyst explains, “The parallel channel is formed by drawing a line between the two bull-market tops, and copying that exact line towards the Corona dump’s bottom.” So with this, ADA has confirmed the pattern, which is very bullish for the digital asset. Fiery Trading explains that it is this trend that could drive the Cardano price toward the new all-time high of $35. However, this is not happening soon as the crypto analyst expects that the next market top for ADA during the bull market will happen sometime in 2025. Nevertheless, the analyst expects ADA to follow this pattern and ride it all the way above $35. ADA bears gains upper hand | Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview.com Cardano Bullishness Spreads Fiery Trading’s prediction above $30 is not the first to emerge for the Cardano price. Another analyst Lucid had also presented a similar argument that the ADA price could climb above $30. However, where Fiery Trading used the parallel channel confirmation as a basis for their analysis, Lucid argued that Cardano had the potential to surge to $30 if “even Ethereum with all its issues hit $500 billion!” Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Flatlines With 99.35% Drop, Here’s Why Investors seem to agree with this outlook as they have increased their accumulation over the last month. Notably, Cardano whales spent over $600 million to buy 1.89 billion ADA in one month. These large investors also increased the frequency of their transactions and the fact that the price continued to climb amid this suggested that they were buying rather than selling. This growing confidence from investors and the fact that Cardano remains one of the top networks in terms of developments suggests that it is primed for an intense breakout.

XRP briefly spiked as much as 10% as an apparent Delaware corporation registry document for the iShares XRP Trust became public. The document was similar to those BlackRock had legitimately filed prior to its formal applications for spot bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH] exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  XRP gave back the entirety of those gains after a BlackRock spokesperson denied any affiliation to the filing and currently is trading down 1.8% over the past 24 hours.  An already lower crypto market was shaken up further by the fake news. SOL, which was a leader of the altcoin rally by more than doubling in price in a month, tumbled to an 8% loss over the past 24 hours. LINK and AVAX plunged more than 10% and 13%, respectively. Cardano's [ADA], Polkadot's [DOT] and dogecoin [DOGE] were each lower by 5%-7%.  BTC also slumped to a session low, now off roughly 2% over the course of the day to around $36,500.

Lens is among a handful of blockchain-oriented startups aiming to capitalize on what experts have characterized as drawbacks of so-called ""Web2"" social-media platforms managed by big centralized companies such as Facebook and Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter). ""Web3"" is the catch-all term for decentralizing these projects with blockchain technology.  “The goal of V1 was to bootstrap early Web3 social networks, resulting in creativity, experimentation and new discovery tools that benefited the Lens ecosystem,"" Aave founder Stani Kulechov, who also serves as CEO of Lens Protocol, said in a press release.  Lens V2, he said, moves ""progressively towards a more modular"" design, giving users ""greater autonomy and flexibility"" in their social media experiences. This could eventually include things like being able to move around your ""social graph"" (a term of art for your following and followers) between interactive platforms.  Unveiled in February 2022, the Lens project raised $15 million from investors including IDEO CoLab Ventures, General Catalyst, Blockchain Capital and Palm Tree as well as individual contributions from Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams, OpenSea co-founder Alex Atallah, entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan and Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.  According to the press release, the Lens upgrade introduces new features including Profile Manager, which ""allows Profiles to be managed by one or more persons, multisigs and DAOs,"" along with Handles, which creates another identity layer that distinguishes “profiles” from “handles” on the platform.”  Another feature is ""Pay to read the rest"" where developers can post previews of posts and then set payment options to read the entire piece, which seems to draw influence from the paid “subscriber” feature on X/Twitter.

This a day after v3 markets were unfrozen following the approval from the community. Aave is a platform where users can supply liquidity in exchange for rewards while borrowers are free to take loans while paying interest in a trustless environment. Aave v2 Markets Unfrozen, Security Is “Non-Negotiable” In the post, Aave said the security of the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol remains a “priority and is non-negotiable for the community.” On November 4, Aave said they received a report “of an issue on a certain feature.” After being validated, the protocol decided to take a step and pause the operation of their v2 markets on Ethereum. At the same time, some v2 markets on Avalanche were frozen. Even so, the v2 markets on Polygon were unaffected. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says One Day Left Until XRP Price Blast-Off, What To Expect Aave also froze operations on Aave v3 on Polygon, Arbitrum, and OP Mainnet. However, v3 markets on Ethereum, Base, and Metis were unaffected. While Aave v2 and v3 markets were frozen, the protocol clarified that users supplying or borrowing affected assets could still withdraw and repay their positions but couldn’t supply or borrow more. With those markets unfrozen, they can now continue as it was before. Will Bulls Ease Past $110? The resumption of services, looking at the AAVE candlestick arrangements in the daily chart, has not impacted prices. However, the token is trading at around 2023 highs and remains within a bullish formation as optimistic traders expect the uptrend to continue. Despite the uptrend, bulls have failed to break above the $110 resistance level. As it is, this reaction level marks August 2022 highs and has not been breached in the past 15 months. The token has more than doubled at spot rates, rising from $50, a critical support level marking January and June 2023 lows. For trend continuation, there must be a solid breakout above $110 and the $60 range from where prices have been moving horizontally in a multi-month accumulation.

42409508,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIJQz,1699911394,"Bogus BlackRock XRP Filing Spoofs ETF Watchers, Crypto Traders","Blackrock (BLK) is not attempting to launch an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), the asset manager said Monday.  A regulatory filing suggesting the company had taken a first step toward doing so is fake, a spokesperson said shortly after the news began circulating on social media. XRP's price jumped more than 10% at one point but had already begun sinking back to its pre-news intraday price of around 65 cents.  Blackrock has previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch spot bitcoin and ether ETFs. Prior to those SEC filings, were filings for a Delaware entity, which acts as the corporate vehicle for the product. Paperwork submitted Monday mimicked those forms but was not in fact filed by the asset management giant.  This is not the first time Delaware's corporate registration process has been abused, seemingly in an attempt to pump crypto prices. A pair of filings in 2021 suggested Grayscale, an asset manager, would launch trust vehicles for two tokens that Grayscale did not have plans for. Grayscale is a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.  Speculators took hold on Monday afternoon as ETF watchers, including Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas, amplified the phony filing, presenting it as true.

20149288,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560450,1699909252,Uniswap’s Financial Win: New Fee Model Rakes In Over $1 Million In A Month Amid DeFi Frenzy,"Uniswap Labs, the company behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has achieved a milestone in its revenue generation strategy. Just a month after its implementation, the firm’s newly introduced front-end fees have crossed roughly $1 million, a testament to the platform’s robust activity and user base. This achievement comes shortly after the mid-October decision to introduce a 0.15% fee on some certain tokens transacted on its front-end interface. This new fee structure applies to various assets, including popular ones like ETH, USDC, WETH, USDT, DAI, WBTC, and others. Related Reading: Uniswap’s New Fee Structure: Are You About To Pay More For These Tokens? Analyzing Uniswap Financial Trajectory As shown in data from Token Terminal, over the past few weeks following the fee’s launch, Uniswap has amassed about $1.14 million. This figure translates to an average daily revenue of approximately $44,000. Projected annually, this rate could bring in roughly or more than $16 million in revenue for Uniswap Labs. Meanwhile, Blockchain reporter Colin Wu estimated daily fees from Uniswap V3’s new structure could range between $388,000 and $444,000. Although the figures have been more modest, they still represent a substantial income stream. Wu’s analysis also reveals that about 35% to 40% of Uniswap’s total transaction volume is processed through the front end, indicating a significant portion of the platform’s activity is subject to these new fees. Regardless, the total cumulative amount recorded in the past weeks, nearly a month, marks a significant financial upturn for the company and highlights the potential profitability of increased fee structures in the DeFi space. Notably, unlike the long-established 0.3% fee, dispensed among liquidity providers as an incentive, the new front-end fees solely directed towards Uniswap Labs is not just a revenue-generating move, as it also signified a strategic shift towards diversifying income sources. So far, this step allows Uniswap Labs to have a direct and consistent revenue stream, independent of the protocol fees traditionally distributed among liquidity providers. DeFi Market Flourishes: Capital Inflows and Token Value Surge It is worth noting that the recent boost in Uniswap’s cumulative front-end fees aligns with an emerging DeFi resurgence, marked by a significant rise in capital inflows. Data from DeFiLlama reveals a notable nearly $10 billion increase in the DeFi market’s total value locked (TVL) over the past month. This upward trajectory has seen the TVL escalate from $36.62 billion in October to roughly $46.65 billion. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Presents Uniswap’s UNI As The Next Coin Primed For Breakout Moreover, this bullish trend extends to DeFi tokens, with leading DeFi assets experiencing substantial growth. Top tokens such as Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), and Uniswap (UNI) have recorded increases of 19.39%, 35%, and 8.56% respectively in the last week, reflecting the overall positive momentum in the crypto market.

42409500,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIIxE,1699906856,"Crypto Tax Proposal Open for Revision, IRS Officials' Questions Suggest","Officials from the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury were interested in how the industry might self-identify assets that have nothing to do with finance and whether stablecoins should be left out of the proposal.  After an incredible 124,000 comments have come in on the IRS proposal, the window closes Monday, beginning the final months of the process that could end in the crypto industry's first major crypto regulations in the U.S.  While crypto representatives and lawyers cautioned the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that its crypto tax proposal is a dangerous and improper overreach, questions posed by a panel of IRS and Department of the Treasury officials at a Monday hearing may reveal some flexibility in the rule as it's still being written.  The panel of federal officials, who weren't identified as they asked questions during the audio hearing, showed interest in potential burdens on decentralized platforms under their proposed rule, whether stablecoin transactions should be reported and how non-financial assets could be identified as such. The crypto tax rule was proposed in August, and a public comment period ended Monday, but a final version is probably months away and would likely respond to at least some of the industry's condemnation.  The government officials asked more than once how digital assets that may not be financial in nature, such as most non-fungible tokens (NFTs), could be separated out, and whether brokers could be in a position to identify them. Marisa Coppel, a lawyer with the Blockchain Association, said she thought that would be possible, especially if the IRS narrows what it considers a ""broker"" to only include the centralized exchanges.  Broker definition  The officials asked Coppel to clarify that central point of industry criticism, which came up repeatedly at the hearing: the proposal's wide definition of brokers required to report data, which currently includes some decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and wallet software. They wanted to know what the decentralized platforms' main burdens would be.  ""There's obviously a ton of information that needs to be collected in order to do this reporting,"" she explained. ""And if there's no specific person that either owns or controls the software that users are using in DeFi, there's no way to collect that information.""  William Entriken, who was involved with the ERC-721 standard that paved the way for NFTs on Ethereum, also argued that there are some kinds of transactions for which the law doesn't or shouldn't let the IRS gather information about – mentioning spending on guns or abortions.  ""There are a lot of special classes of purchases,"" said Entriken, and this regulation's demand for reporting individual transactions would contrast with those, legally. ""That's going to be a problem.""  Stablecoins  The government panel asked Entriken if they were to change their proposal's insistence on reporting transactions of assets that are never meant to show a loss or gain – such as stablecoins – whether that would also address the problem of specialized classes of purchases the government shouldn't be tracking. Mostly, he suggested.  The stablecoin reporting requirement in the proposal was a frequent point of contention, with people from the crypto sector saying it doesn't make sense to include those transactions as taxable exchanges of assets. Stablecoins are tokens whose value is tied to a steady asset, such as the dollar, and are used as the common currency in the digital assets industry.  ""Do you propose that there should not be reporting with respect to stablecoins?"" one of the panelists asked a representative of Coinbase (COIN). ""Do you have a suggestion for how the term stablecoin would be defined?""  Lawrence Zlatkin, Coinbase's vice president for tax, said in the hearing that ""tax reporting when there is no gain or loss, including stablecoins, will result in expansive but low value reporting.""  The IRS has itself noted that its proposal could bring on several billion additional tax filings each year, potentially flooding the already overburdened agency.  ""The IRS should not police every digital asset transaction,"" Zlatkin argued.  Privacy  Getting into another of the core concerns – crypto users' privacy – the IRS officials asked a lawyer who specializes in U.S. financial know-your-customer laws about the inner workings of digital identification systems that could maintain people's anonymity. They discussed the technology of privacy tokens and how they're already being adopted in the industry.  And the government team asked a representative of a transaction aggregator – businesses that let clients connect their wallets and exchange accounts to a central hub for figuring out their tax burdens – how such services figure out the cost basis for assets and how those businesses can improve their consistency after reports that different firms have been known to come up with different data on a customer's tax liabilities.  Shehan Chandrasekera, the head of tax strategy at CoinTracker, suggested the IRS ""could consider introducing standards"" for the aggregation industry.  If the IRS finishes this rule before the Securities and Exchange Commission completes a couple of its own crypto-targeted efforts, it would mark the first significant crypto regulation in the U.S. Most of the 13 people invited to speak at Monday's hearing were critical of the proposal (as were the vast majority of more than 124,000 submitted comments), with some of them suggesting it could have dire consequences that snuff out crypto innovation in the U.S. One of them was just confused as to how a regular person navigates what's going on.  Tavarus Blackmon, an NFT artist, lamented that it's difficult for a small business like his to ""successfully reconcile our tax liability."" As for the IRS proposal, he posed a question before the 10-minute speaker timer cut him off:  ""If a broker does not know they are a broker, are they still a broker?""

42409501,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIItv,1699906323,What Are the Tax Implications of the Alleged Binance Wallet Hack (or Any Crypto Exploit)?,"This weekend, a crypto hacker cost himself big after successfully draining $27 million worth of tether (USDT) from a cryptocurrency wallet. The wallet in question was reportedly linked to the crypto exchange Binance’s deployer address, according to on-chain sleuth ZachXBT.  The exploit began around 4:36 P.M. on Nov. 11, with the unknown attacker quickly converting the stolen stablecoins for ether [ETH], which was then sent to low liquidity but noncustodial exchanges including FixedFloat and ChangeNow before being converted to bitcoin [BTC], using the permissionless THORChain bridge.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “They will probably deposit the funds to a mixer or send to a sketchy service next,” noted ZachXBT.  The attacker better hope he can access a mixer to launder those funds soon — cause ever step of the way, at least under U.S. law, is a taxable transaction.  Hacks like this happen All Of The Time in crypto, and is likely only being discussed because of the alleged victim: world’s largest exchange Binance.The paltry sum, $27 million, may be part of the ingenuity of the hacker, who appears smart or experienced enough to know that had he kept the stolen funds in USDT the cache likely would have been frozen by the stablecoin’s issuer, Tether.  Speculation, at best informed guesses at this point, has it that someone who has or had inside knowledge of Binance’s operations might be behind the attack. As others pointed out, keeping millions and millions in a hot wallet (a wallet with a live internet connection) is asking for trouble.  According to on-chain data, the attacked wallet received $26 million from another Binance hot wallet called “Binance 16” on Nov. 5. This may speak to and against the Binance Insider theory, in that someone at Binance may be privy to know the wallet was recently topped up but also that, because Binance is a prime target for attacks, being something as a trophy for hackers, being the largest exchange and all, it’s likely the exchange’s hot wallets are monitored closely by would-be hackers.  Binance hasn’t confirmed or denied the attack, at time of writing. Binance's deployer wallet has been inactive since December, 2020, and the victim’s wallet isn’t necessarily Binance affiliated. However, on the Binance blog a pseudonymous contributor with an impressive posting history, named The Narrator, did write about the exploit, and said: “The victim's address is connected to the #Binance deployer.”  A Binance spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk its security team is investigating the exploit.  Being as the hacker and victim are still unknown, this is a moment to reflect on a related and growing issue in crypto: taxes. This week is Tax Week here at Consensus Magazine, and we’re focused on the big, outstanding questions concerning taxation policies around the world for this nascent industry.  One of the biggest issues happens to be the tax implications for people and companies that fall victim to an exploit. It’s a massive issue, considering how frequently exploits happen across DeFi and in crypto generally. Just last week, one of the largest exchanges Poloniex confirmed it suffered a $114 million breach, for instance.  Poloniex said it’d make affected users whole, but that in itself raises important tax filing implications. When FTX, the fraudulent exchange run by a team of money launderers led by the recently convicted Sam Bankman-Fried, was hacked in November 2022, it added to FTX customers' worries.  See also: The IRS Should Heed This Warning | Tax Week 2023  “Under the [U.S.] tax code, claiming that a loss is the result of a theft is much more difficult than just saying it was a theft. A taxpayer generally needs to show that a criminal theft occurred,” Head of Government Solutions at TaxBit Miles Fuller wrote in a recent op-ed. Additionally, traders need to convince the IRS their activity was in service of gaining income and that a genuine theft actually happened — points that are complicated in the wider world of crypto, especially because exploits so often go unsolved.  Further, Fuller wrote, “taxpayers will still need to wait before deducting any losses because the losses are not deductible until there is reasonable certainty as to if or how much of a recovery will be made because that recovery reduces the amount of the loss that can be claimed.”  When hack victims receive restitution, how should they characterize it? What if an exchange decides to reimburse users using a token, a la Bitfinex in 2018? Token airdrops are generally considered to be income when received, a policy that many tax experts would like to update to the point airdrops are converted to other cryptocurrencies or fiat.  Finally, as a matter of course the recent hot wallet hack is a reminder of how burdensome current tax policy is for average crypto users. The exploiter made a series of transactions immediately following the hack — sending $2.7 million to 10 new addresses within eight minutes, according to Etherscan data.  Under U.S. law, each of those conversions from tether to ether are taxable events, as were the following conversions into bitcoin. It’s hard to feel sympathy for a thief, and right now it seems unlikely he’ll pay either way, but the trail of transactions is a reminder of how unsensible current tax policy is. The amount being laundered has mostly stayed the same, and yet with each hop a user’s tax bill grows.  This is one of the many reasons why cryptocurrencies have yet to catch on as a regular form of payment despite sharing many of the attributes of money. Many tax experts for instance argue that conversions should be considered “in-kind” payments or have de minimus restrictions around them.  In either case, it’s unlikely crypto or crypto hacks will disappear anytime soon. So let’s think hard about the tax implications.",NEGATIVE,USDT,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDT | BNB | AIRDROP,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/13/what-are-the-tax-implications-of-the-alleged-binance-wallet-hack-or-any-crypto-exploit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54e8ed67e5250d4d86c3802c9e51b325d9c11b8b-2000x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Wallets With 100 To 10,000 BTC Have Been Selling Recently As pointed out by analyst Ali in a post on X, the large BTC investors might have been harvesting their profits recently. The indicator of interest here is the “BTC Supply Distribution,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin the different wallet groups in the sector are holding. The addresses or investors are divided into these groups based on the total number of coins they currently carry. For instance, the 1 to 10 coins cohort includes all wallets with a balance of at least 1 and at most 10 BTC. Related Reading: Chainlink Forms Sell Signal, Analyst Predicts Pullback To This Level In the context of the current discussion, the 100 to 10,000 BTC range is of focus. The 100 to 1,000 coins group is popularly called the “sharks,” while the 1,000 to 10,000 cohort includes the whales. Both groups carry significant amounts, so their behavior can be relevant for the wider market. Though the whales are much larger of the two, and thus hold much more influence on the network. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the combined Supply Distribution of the Bitcoin sharks and whales over the past couple of months: The value of the metric seems to have registered a sharp drop in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the 100 to 10,000 coins Bitcoin investors have seen their supply go through a steep drawdown during the past week. During this drop, these humongous entities have sold around 60,000 BTC, worth about $2.2 billion at the current asset price. This is a notable amount, and considering that the timing of the distribution has coincided with BTC’s latest break above the $37,000 level, it would appear possible that these key holders have participated in this huge selloff to harvest the profits that they would have amassed in the rally. The sharks and whales also took part in some selling when BTC had broken above $35,000 last month, but both the rate and the scale of the selloff were lesser when compared to the one now, as the Supply Distribution for these cohorts has plunged rather steeply this time around. So far, however, despite this large selloff, Bitcoin hasn’t had much trouble maintaining around the $37,000 mark. The asset initially saw a pullback when the selling started, as it retraced towards $36,000, but it rebounded back quickly enough. Related Reading: Is A Bearish Reversal Coming For Bitcoin?

Crypto Influencer Predict XRP Bull Success A crypto influencer on X (formerly Twitter) called BoringSleuth has expressed his sentiment about XRP’s potential success in the eagerly anticipated bull run. Related Reading: Renowned Economist Warns Of Bitcoin Crash Before Spot ETF Approvals BoringSleuth has stated that the XRP price could stand to benefit considerably from the bull market due to its lack of affiliations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He said that other cryptocurrencies like DAG which have no links with the CCP may also experience a successful bull run. “The protocols that weren’t in bed with the CCP will be the benefactors of future bull cycles. A protocol like DAG, which works with the DOD is one example of a well-positioned protocol. XRP is another,” BoringSleuth stated. Responding to BoringSleuth’s declaration, an X (formerly Twitter) user posted a screenshot stating that Ripple had deep ties with the IDG which is strongly backed by the CCP. “The Protocol may or may not be clear…but Ripple has deep ties to IDG, which has strong support from the CCP. IDG are also investors in Coinbase and KuCoin,” an X member, AltarofEgo stated. Additionally, when asked by a crypto member on X what he meant by “well positioned,” BoringSleuth responded by saying that crypto companies that have no links to the CCP are strategically positioned to become the prime beneficiaries position of retail and investment cash flows in the case CCP-linked companies ever faces scrutiny. “If there is a crackdown on CCP-affiliated companies, then that investment and retail money will flow somewhere. The companies well positioned to get those dollars will be the ones not in bed with the CCP,” BoringSleuth stated.

A Surprising Chart Formation Sparks Excitement,"Summary Dollar-Cost Averaging: The sensible approach for investing in cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Advanced Technical Analysis and Bitcoin fractals: The intriguing world of fractals in Bitcoin charts hints at the next price vertical. The fractal thesis in 2020-2021 yielded lucrative results, demonstrating that this isn't just theoretical speculation. As the Bitcoin ETF project gains momentum and a halving event approaches, the cryptocurrency landscape is poised for change. Investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has gained traction over time, and I have been suggesting that the strategy of ""dollar-cost averaging"" to build a comfortable position is the way a sensible investor should approach the situation. While I remain cautious due to the regulatory concerns and security issues of crypto, there's an intriguing development in Bitcoin that will excite bulls – a compelling chart formation rooted in ‘advanced’ technical analysis. To begin, let's explore the concept of ""fractals,"" which are patterns created by recurring processes, which occur over all time frames. Fractals, first discovered by Prof. Benoit Mandelbrot, have long been a niche technique in technical analysis in equities and are now favoured by the cryptocurrency community, possibly due to the familiarity brought about by generational factors. The chart we're examining highlights proposed fractals in the Bitcoin chart, and they are indeed worth your attention if you have a taste for the Bitcoin dream of the next 10x. If the entire pattern replicates itself, Bitcoin could be on the verge of the sort of price vertical it is famous for. Naturally, scepticism is warranted, but consider this: Proposed fractals in the BTC chart (ADVFN) As hindsight has no value, I must say that using this fractal thesis in 2020-2021 was very lucrative for me, so this is not some theoretic musing. Fractals don't produce mirror images but rather display eerily repeating patterns, which are similar to those found in nature. Think of it as the broccoli of technical analysis. A close up of a green plant ( Automatically generated) It is a good idea to watch out for them because they suggest a driver behind the scene hammering away at the price series. Now, let's revisit a master fractal as seen in 2013 (which occurred twice): Master fractal from 2013 (ADVFN) For those in the Bitcoin x10 camp, these fractals can serve as valuable guides. However, if you identify as a ""Bitcoin maxi,"" your strategy is dollar-cost averaging (DCA) and long-term holding, so this sort of analysis may appear as mere noise. However, for anyone who doesn’t consider Bitcoin an immortal asset, the here and now is crucial. Notably, the impending Bitcoin ETF project will make Bitcoin more accessible to conventional investors, and with the ‘halving’ event on the horizon there is plenty of price tension. Yet, the crypto landscape remains complex and riddled with risks, so for most, DCA remains a solid approach – unless you're ready to embrace the daring and precarious path of a ‘bold pilot’ fully committed to going all in. For me the way to go is to follow the example of the ‘super rich:’ don’t mess with more than 1% of your net worth in this kind of super high-risk game; 2.5-5% maybe. There are more than enough ways to lose all of your crypto outside of the price itself, so that very fact is a good reason to be extremely careful.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4651265-bitcoin-about-to-go-parabolic-surprising-chart-formation-sparks-excitement?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20145795.jpeg

To the extent that enthusiasm around possible approval of a spot bitcoin ETF has run out of some fuel, bulls might be looking to Tuesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a fresh catalyst higher.  Economists expect monthly headline CPI in October to have slowed to 0.1% from 0.4% in September. Year-over-year CPI is anticipated to have fallen to 3.3% from 3.7%. The core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, is expected to have remained flat from September – 0.3% monthly and 4.1% year-over-year.  Both gauges remain well above the U.S. Federal Reserve's 2% target. While the central bank has indicated that inflation doesn't need to fall all the way to 2% as a requisite for ending rate hikes and considering rate cuts, speakers have made clear they want to see continued progress toward that target.  To the extent that higher interest rates compete with risk assets for investor dollars, the idea of a lower rate regime might provide a boon to bitcoin.

This remarkable ascent underscores Solana’s resilience and appeal within the cryptocurrency landscape. The cryptocurrency has not merely kept pace but has outpaced many of its counterparts, solidifying its status as a noteworthy investment choice. Presently exchanging hands at approximately $58, Solana exhibits an impressive display of relentless upward momentum, notably experiencing a noteworthy 40% surge in value within the last seven days alone. Source: Coingecko This surge not only reflects the cryptocurrency’s immediate strength but also contributes to its status as a formidable player in the digital asset arena. Related Reading: Boom! Cronos Unleashes 57% Weekend Explosion, Beating All In The Top 100 Crypto Ranking Solana Price Gets Boost From Whales As of the current moment, Solana proudly holds the prestigious position as the 7th largest cryptocurrency, fortified by a substantial market capitalization that has exceeded the impressive milestone of $24 billion. 🚨 325,222 #SOL (18,666,993 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Binancehttps://t.co/ECEpdMJM72 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) November 11, 2023 Whale Alert revealed two significant Solana trades on November 12th, each worth more than $30 million. Transferring 325,222 SOL—worth more than $18.6 million—to the Binance exchange was the initial transaction. Solana whales have been engaging in a higher volume of huge transactions lately, transferring a considerable portion of the tokens to exchanges. Given this recent behavior, is it feasible that SOL’s gains would gradually decline? Taking long positions, traders are now witnessing a notable shift in behavior due to Solana’s highest positive funding rate of the year, reaching 0.07% on November 12. SOL market cap reached $24.2 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com This optimistic outlook reflects their confidence in the continued upward movement of the price. Meanwhile, the surge in Open Interest (OI) signifies a capital influx into Solana, with traders actively opening new positions. Coinglass’ data reveals that Solana’s OI volume has been on a consistent upward trend since the beginning of November, reaching over $760 million at the time of writing. Source: Coinglass Notably, the last instance of SOL experiencing such a high OI volume was around May 2022. This historical context emphasizes the significance of the current surge in OI and its implications for Solana’s market dynamics. The rate of SOL is near the resistance on the hourly chart, indicating that buyers have some degree of influence over sellers. By the end of the day, if nothing changes, the growth may go pas the $60 level. Related Reading: Mysterious Wallet Transfers 18 Million MATIC To Coinbase – What’s Going On? According to the weekly chart analysis, the rate of SOL is poised to conclude within the positive zone. Currently, there is a lack of negative indicators. In the event of the bar’s closure in proximity to the $60 range, it is plausible that an upward movement might ensue, potentially culminating in an examination of the $65 range in the near future.

FTX’s former general counsel, Can Sun, and former Alameda Research software developer Armani Ferrante have teamed up to start Trek Labs, a Dubai-based company that recently obtained a license from the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, or VARA, which regulates digital assets in the emirate, the Wall Street Journal reported last week.  Trek Labs was founded by Sun, and Ferrante is CEO of its holding company in the British Virgin Islands. Ferrante is also the founder of Backpack, a digital wallet company, which is integrated into the exchange and under which name Trek Labs will do business.  Backpack closed a $20 million funding round in September 2022 for which FTX’s venture arm contributed half of the investment. Ferrante told the WSJ that he held the majority of the raised funds on the FTX exchange and lost it all when it collapsed.  Sun was one of the key witnesses in his former boss’ criminal trial earlier this month, telling jurors that he “never approved” FTX lending customer funds to Alameda Research. He served as general counsel for the failed crypto exchange from August 2021 until its collapse in November 2022.  Backpack Exchange, the official name of the new exchange, will do business differently from FTX, the first step being that its technology will allow users to self-custody their funds. That means nobody but the user will be able to access their crypto wallets.  The exchange, which is looking to sell a 10% stake that would value it at over $100 million, plans to launch in beta later this month, according to the report.

20142314,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560423,1699894813,Polygon (MATIC) Price Fueled By Increase In Whale Activity,"Polygon’s native coin MATIC continues to gain traction as the cryptocurrency experienced an impressive increase in whale transactions over the past 30 days, bolstering price growth for the digital asset and the ecosystem. Whale Activities Propels Polygon MATIC’s Growth Recently, Polygon MATIC’s whale transaction volume significantly increased over the past 30 days, which has sparked increased interest in the crypto asset. Whale transactions are classified as transactions that are over $100,000. Data from on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock has revealed a 3,800% increase in whale transactions within the Polygon network. The increase in whale transactions might indicate the presence of active buying and selling maneuvers from institutional and large-scale investors. Related Reading: Analyst Endorses MATIC, Time To Double Down On Polygon And Ethereum Layer-2 Tokens? “Institutional and whale demand has picked up strongly, with Bitcoin seeing an 80% increase in the volume of transactions of over $100k, Ethereum 170%, and Polygon over 3,800% compared to 30 days ago,” IntoTheBlock stated. Initially, whale transactions from major players can influence the market dynamics of a cryptocurrency asset. This is one reason why MATIC’s price has experienced a significant uptick in recent weeks. Furthermore, it was also revealed that wallets holding 100,000 to 1 million MATIC have amassed over 42.88 million of the token since October 24. In addition, 161 transactions totaling $100,000 or more were conducted in a single day—the most since July 2023. MATIC’s price is not the only asset this increase in whale activity has positively impacted in the last 30 days. The crypto’s market capitalization has also increased significantly following the whale activities and accumulation, recording a 62% increase in the past 30 days. MATIC’s Performance Over The Past Week Just last week, the cryptocurrency went past the $0.75 price mark, indicating an over 50% increase in price surge in the last 20 days. This means the crypto is showing significant strength, which could see it reaching the $1 mark by the end of the year. Related Reading: A Chance At Redemption: Analyst Puts MATIC Price At $1.5 MATIC experienced a 33% year-to-date (YTD) decline in September but recovered within a month. The MATIC’s price rally puts it in a profit-making position. Currently, the price of MATIC is $0.87, with a 24-hour trading volume of $943,748,349 as of the time of writing. Its market capitalization is valued at $943,748,349, with an over 4% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. In addition, the web3 gaming platform Immutable recent partnership with Ubisoft might also significantly affect the price of MATIC. This is because the platform is the first to establish a zero-knowledge (zk) scaling solution for the Ethereum (ETH) community, and Polygon will power the platform’s zkEVM.

The new ""BitStream"" proposal by Linus, a core contributor to Bitcoin-based zero-knowledge proofs developer ZeroSync, sets out how an open market for content hosting could be created by ""an atomic swap of coins for files.""  Using payment channels like Lightning, the server would charge for each download, thereby avoiding spiraling overhead costs in the event of a subsequent huge number of downloads.  ""The server encrypts the file such that if there’s any mismatch during decryption the client can derive a compact fraud proof,"" Linus said in the abstract to the white paper dated Nov. 12. ""A bond contract guarantees the client receives the exact file or they can punish the server.""  The BitStream proposal echoes the BitVM paper's attempt address the risk of damaging the network's performance by clogging it up with transactions or other computations by carrying them out off-chain. In both cases, transactions or computations would only need to carried out on-chain for verification or to address a dispute.  In response to Linus's post about the new white paper on X (formerly Twitter), one user suggested BitStream could do ""for storage space what BitVM does for execution time,"" with which Linus agreed and confirmed that the two proposals could be combined.  Another poster on X asked, ""What makes this better than the numerous storage cryptocurrencies we have had before?""  Linus answered, ""It's Bitcoin.""

Efforts so far to claw back what it says were ""misappropriated funds"" have included suing former FTX executives and even the parents of founder Sam Bankman-Fried.  Friday's legal complaint filed in Delaware targets Bybit Fintech Ltd., its investment arm Mirana and several individuals, including Mirana executive Sean Tan. It alleges the investment unit ""received gross transfers from FTX.com of digital assets currently valued at approximately $838 million,"" of which about $500 million were transferred in the days before FTX halted withdrawals on Nov. 8, 2022.  The suit also alleges an additional $115 million in digital and fiat assets were transferred to entities and individuals affiliated with Bybit and Mirana.  ""As with Mirana, the majority of these assets – more than $61 million – were withdrawn in the final days before FTX.com and FTX US disabled withdrawals,"" the complaint said.  The FTX estate claims Bybit was given VIP status on the exchange, and that, in the days leading up to the bankruptcy filing, Mirana and affiliates ""raced to withdraw assets"" from their FTX accounts.  ""Mirana leveraged its VIP connections to pressure FTX Group employees to fulfill its withdrawal requests as soon as assets became available, further reducing the funds available to meet withdrawal requests by FTX.com’s non-VIP customers,"" the complaint said, adding that FTX employees also repeatedly changed Mirana’s Know-Your-Customer (KYC) settings in the days prior to the withdrawals pause.  The suit seeks the return of assets ""preferentially"" or ""fraudulently"" transferred to Bybit and affiliates that are now allegedly ""held hostage"" by the latter.  FTX's former management has been accused of misappropriating customer funds by the estate's new management and the U.S. government. Bankman-Fried was recently found guilty of fraud against FTX customers by a New York jury and faces jail time when sentenced next year.

The crypto surged by 25% in the first week of November to cross over $0.73, marking the first cross over this price point since June. However, XRP has since lost some of these gains. The crypto is now trading at $0.6574 at the time of writing and is down by 5.04% in a 7-day timeframe. According to crypto analyst and enthusiast Will Taylor, known as Cryptoinsightuk on social media, this is quite normal for XRP, and price history has shown it’s only a matter of time before it catches up. The analyst made this known while sharing his technical analysis on X (formerly Twitter). According to him, technical indicators point to liquidity rolling into XRP very soon, and a price takeoff is expected in less than two days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hard Crash Or Mega Pump: Why $31,000 Holds The Key Liquidity To Rotate Into XRP Cryptoinsightsuk has predicted a further increase for XRP in the near term, resonating with other analysts observing a positive trajectory for XRP. The asset has mostly interlinked with the wider movements within Bitcoin and Ethereum since October’s lows. It has now lagged behind, with liquidity flowing to other altcoins like Solana and Cardano. Technical analysis using the RSI indicator shared by Cryptoinsightsuk showed that XRP recently entered overbought territory since it rose a lot in a short period of time.

XRP is ready for a strong rally now that its growth is no longer suppressed by the SEC lawsuit. It has now formed support at the $0.65 level, and the first step will be to break over $0.70. The next resistance is at its yearly high of $0.80. Other bullish analyses have come in for XRP in recent days. A previous X post by Cryptoinsightsuk predicted a strong rally to $10 at least.

As CGO of Optimism Unlimited Ltd., an operating subsidiary of the Optimism Foundation, Wyatt will be responsible for supporting blockchain development, and helping developers build across the Optimism ecosystem. The Optimism Foundation is tasked with supporting the broader community of companies and developers committed to Optimism's technology, with OP Mainnet (previously known simply as Optimism) ranking as the second-biggest layer-2 network atop Ethereum.  Earlier this year, when the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase launched its Base blockchain, the project relied on technology from OP Labs, the primary developer behind Optimism.  Wyatt previously was president at Polygon Labs, before leaving in July when then-Chief Legal Officer Marc Boiron was promoted to CEO.  He has a wealth of experience in gaming from his time at Polygon as well as in a prior role at YouTube, where he first started exploring non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital ownership.  “I really do think that Optimism is the best team in crypto, hands down,” Wyatt told CoinDesk in an interview. “I loved my time at YouTube, I loved my time at Polygon.

The wallet drainers are misusing Create2, a piece of code that is used by the likes of Uniswap to predict the address of a contract before it is deployed on the Ethereum network.  By misusing Create2, wallet drainers can instantly create temporary wallet addresses to receive funds after a user clicks on a malicious signature. When users send funds or interact with a smart contract, they will be prompted to ""approve"" a signature, hackers often disguise permissions within this signature to gain access to a user's wallet.  The use of Create2 bypasses security alerts that would typically warn a user before signing the signature.  Research from ScamSniffer and SlowMist estimates that $60 million has been stolen from around 99,000 victims in the past six-months.  One group has been using the Create2 code to steal $3 million from 11 victims since August.

42409520,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIQgf,1699889829,The IRS Is Making Crypto Compliance Impossible,"Crypto once again doesn’t fit into the regulatory round hole. The proposed 6045 digital asset broker regulations – currently in a comment period – are filled with problematic requirements. A few of them make taxpayer compliance impossible.  This post is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week 2023. Kirk Phillips is founder of cryptobullseye.zone an education site with crypto crash courses and mastermind coaching for learning mistake-free crypto.  Digital asset brokers must report proceeds and cost-basis on a proposed Form 1099-DA information return like a 1099-B but for digital assets. The complexity of cost-basis reporting creates multiple issues for both brokers and taxpayers creating even more work for the already daunting task of calculating crypto taxes.  Choice of cost basis  The proposed regs clarify taxpayers have two cost basis choices:  FIFO: The default method deems the oldest purchases as sold first.  Specific Identification: The taxpayer chooses which digital assets to sell.  Many people in crypto are familiar with FIFO and have already been using it for tax calculations. If taxpayers do not choose FIFO, they get relegated to a “specific identification” where most of the cost-basis issues arise for digital assets.  Specific identification requirements  Taxpayers are responsible for specifically identifying the units of digital assets sold no later than the date and time of the sale, disposition, or transfer regardless of whether a broker is used.  Specific identification must happen before-the-trade NOT after the trade. Taxpayers must dig through their records and mark the specific BTC (or other asset) in their “crypto inventory” they intend to sell. Then the taxpayer makes a trade and repeats the process in a time intensive exercise.  The IRS states, “A specific identification of the units of a digital asset sold, disposed of, or transferred is made if, no later than the date and time of the sale, disposition, or transfer, the taxpayer identifies on its books and records the particular units to be sold…”  If a taxpayer uses a broker they must instruct the broker which digital assets they intend to sell before-the-trade. In the case of a broker taxpayers must:  Identify and document digital assets in their own records  Tell the broker to sell the assets they’ve identified  The IRS states, “…the taxpayer specifies to the broker having custody of the digital assets the particular units of the digital asset to be sold…”  Now, if you don’t meet the spec id requirements, your basis defaults to FIFO and you could incur a gigantic tax liability. Your spec ID gets recalculated under a FIFO basis.  Impossible to notify  These rules apply to securities sales, so there is no surprise to the logic. However, crypto neither operates like legacy finance nor fits into the proposed reporting regime.  Read more: Crypto Tax Basics: A 101 for Beginners  Let’s start with the broker notification requirement. Centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken don’t provide a notification mechanism to support specific identification. This leaves taxpayers with no way to instruct the exchange to sell a specific lot of, say, bitcoin.  If the exchange doesn’t support specific identification, they will default to FIFO reporting for all their customers. Meanwhile, taxpayers who previously used HIFO (highest in, first out), CCFO (closest cost, first out) or some other cost-basis method in prior years end up with a perpetual cost-basis mismatch. The exchange issues a 1099-DA on a FIFO basis and taxpayer A calculates a totally different gain or loss using their own cost-basis method. You should start to see where the extra work is creeping in.  If it’s impossible for taxpayers to instruct brokers, then it’s impossible for taxpayers to comply with this rule. Even if taxpayers could notify brokers, they still need to have a system to track and report 1099-DAs on a specific identification basis.  This creates two problems for taxpayers:  How are taxpayers expected to reconcile between the 1099-DA and their own calculations?  If taxpayers can even figure out the difference, how do they report differences on their tax return and explain the issue?  Impossible to calculate  Crypto tax software providers typically include FIFO and one or more other cost-basis methods such as HIFO and CCFO in the software settings. Taxpayers have previously used these non-FIFO methods as a proxy for specific identification as the software is not designed for taxpayers to identify digital assets before-the-trade. All these cost-basis choices including FIFO are a logic methodology that calculate gains and losses after-the-trade.  Read more: International Deal to Combat Crypto Tax Evasion to Start 2027 as 48 Countries Sign Up  It’s practically impossible to calculate crypto taxes without the aid of crypto tax software, yet even if the taxpayer marks their records to indicate specific digital assets they intend to sell, the software can’t incorporate those digital assets into gain and loss calculations. Taxpayers are stuck with one of the logical cost-basis methods and they have to export their current crypto holdings into a CSV file to manually mark records outside of the software.  If it’s impossible for taxpayers to calculate crypto tax without software and the software can’t support specific identification, then it’s impossible for taxpayers to comply.  Why is this a problem for taxpayers?  If taxpayers can’t meet the specific identification requirements, their cost basis method defaults to FIFO resulting in a recalculation of gains and losses. Then taxpayers could incur a gigantic tax liability including significant interest and penalties (which is headache #1).  The difference between FIFO and other methods can be night-and-day, which is the reason taxpayers used a method other than FIFO in the first place. For example, Taxpayer A bought ETH in the 2014 crowdsale and FIFO would “sell” the old ETH every time they make an ETH trade. Naturally, Taxpayer A opted to use a non-FIFO method to minimize gains.  Meanwhile, taxpayer B has seven exchange accounts and 29 wallets for a total of 36. Before the proposed regs, Taxpayer B was 100% responsible for calculating his own crypto taxes. He gathered all transactions together from all exchanges and wallets into crypto tax software to produce Form 8949 for gains and losses on a universal basis. Universal means all transactions are dumped together for calculation purposes “as-if” they happened on a single exchange.  Taxpayer B must now track and calculate gains on an exchange-by-exchange and address-by-address basis. After the proposed regs, Taxpayer B will get at least 36 1099-DAs and end up reconciling them with his own calculations. Instead of having one universal calculation, he now has 36 separate calculations. It’s likely every one of the 36 1099-DAs is different from B’s calculation from various cost basis issues. The IRS just doubled, tripled or even quadrupled your tax prep cost as a result.  The solution  Even if brokers and crypto tax software providers change to a specific identification friendly process it doesn’t magically make all the problems disappear. The IRS should listen to the thousands of comments, eliminate 1099-DA cost basis reporting and change to “proceeds only” reporting which would solve most of the headaches.

20138885,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560408,1699887620,XRP Price Path To $1: Exploring Two Potential Outcomes From The $0.66 Resistance Level,"Following a sideways weekend, the XRP price stumbled on a critical resistance level, forcing the token to revisit support. The crypto market is following a similar trajectory on short timeframes, but an analyst believes the current price action could set the stage for a bigger rally. Related Reading: XRP Will Diverge Away From Price Speculation: Crypto Pundit As of this writing, the XRP price trades at $0.64 with a 3% loss during today’s trading session. In the previous week, the token recorded a 7% loss, operating as the work performer in the top 10 by market cap, followed by Cardano (ADA), which recorded a 4% profit over the same period. XRP Meets Resistance But Prepares For Bigger Run To The Upside? According to a pseudonym analyst, the XRP price met resistance at $0.664, which could trigger potential scenarios. On the positive side, the cryptocurrency is targeting a key level at $1, the analyst believes. As seen in the chart below, XRP needs to clear the high of its current range at $0.73 before making a run to the upside. At around $1, the cryptocurrency would climb above the 0.8 Fibonacci Extension, a series of levels used to measure resistance and support. In that sense, $0.9 is the most significant resistance for XRP and its potential bullish run. The trader believes the bullish momentum dissipated after a close below the 0.66 Fibonacci extension, which could push the token back to $0.61 or $0.58 if bulls failed to push back. On the upcoming price trend for XRP, the analyst stated the following, favoring a sideways price action scenario: The side move is continuing between $0.6649 & $0.6131, and the latter becomes important. We can touch here because we stayed below the target level. The target is still to hit $0.87 and $1.05 in the very short term, but the prerequisite is to stay above $0.6649. When Will The XRP Price Hit $1? Previously, the same analyst claimed that the resistance at $0.66 opens the door for a run at the $0.7 level, as mentioned. The analyst believes the token could break above these levels in the coming month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hard Crash Or Mega Pump: Why $31,000 Holds The Key XRP could hit $0.87 on November 19th if the bulls successfully attempted to breach this resistance. Corresponding with the Elliot Wave Theory, the analyst concluded: XRP broke the 4-hour support of $0.6649 but is still strolling around it. The daily still has not broken yet. We call this C Wave Expanded C, and it’s completely technical. We wicked to $0.6287 yesterday & Fibonacci Support there is $0.6131. This correction is completely technical and routine. I trust $XRP to consolidate between $0.66 & $0.61 and continue to finalise the 5th Wave at $0.8737 very soon.

42409526,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIR3o,1699886290,The IRS Should Offer a Free Tax Reporting Tool to DeFi Users,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is moving in the direction of providing a free software service to taxpayers, as evidenced by the Direct File pilot program in 13 states, starting in 2024. The project enables taxpayers to file their taxes directly with the IRS with the assistance of software similar to Turbo Tax.  For decentralized finance (DeFi), the IRS should use open, traceable and tamper-proof public blockchain data to provide taxpayers with similar free tax assistance concerning their gains/losses and cost-basis reporting information. This would eliminate the need for DeFi protocols to collect personal user data and file 1099 forms with the IRS under a recently proposed crypto-broker rule.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week, presented by TaxBit. Michael D. Bodman is the president, founder and managing director of the digital asset and technology investment firm Open Source Ventures, and lecturer in economics and finance at the Anderson College of Business and Computing of Regis University. This is an excerpt from a comment letter Bodman filed pursuant to the proposed IRS crypto broker rule.  See also: How the Crypto Industry Responded to the IRS Proposed Broker Rule  The IRS proposal  In August 2023, the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS released a proposed rule that defines the term broker in the context of digital assets. Brokers are demarcated to include not only centralized exchanges like Coinbase that directly effectuate transactions but also individual software developers, self-custodial digital wallets with swap connections and decentralized software protocols that facilitate (directly or indirectly) digital asset transfers or trades.  As of this writing, the proposal has generated over 120,000 public comments, indicating how controversial the rule is.  The rule creates a giant honeypot of personally identifiable information  The proposed rule identifies various parties that facilitate (directly or indirectly) or effectuate (indirectly) digital asset transfers and trades. These parties include:  Offering access to a protocol,  Offering an automated market maker system,  Offering services to discover the best buy and sell prices,  Providing self-custodial wallets with swap functions that enable access to decentralized blockchain trading platforms, and  Offering Internet access services, potentially including web browsers and Internet service providers.  None of these parties directly effectuates transactions of digital assets within the scope of the authority granted by Congress, as crypto exchange Coinbase stated in its comment letter on the proposed rule.  Unfit for purpose  The Treasury Department and the IRS seek to retrofit paper-based IRS-1099 reporting requirements designed for another era onto persons and groups of persons who are not organized and do not function like intermediaries and thus brokers.  Read more: EU Formally Agrees on New Crypto Tax Data Sharing Rules  If a staggering number of parties who do not fit the definition of broker — 98% of which are small businesses according to the Treasury and IRS — must collect personal information, safeguard that information and transmit it to the IRS, the rule creates a giant honeypot of personally identifiable information (“PII”) for malicious hackers.  The IRS does not have a good track record of keeping taxpayer information secure. In 2016, the IRS admitted that more than 700,000 social security numbers and other sensitive personal data were stolen from the agency’s systems.  A lawsuit by trader Ken Griffith, whose tax data was leaked by the IRS, notes that the IRS has received a decade of annual warnings by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration that the agency’s “number one major management and performance challenge area” is data security, according to the Wall Street Journal.  The Treasury Department and the IRS seek to retrofit paper-based IRS-1099 reporting requirements designed for another era  There is no better measure of the sheer profligacy in IRS use of taxpayer money than the anticipated volume of IRS-1099 forms to be processed.  “Our estimate right now is that we will ingest — don’t fall off your chairs — eight billion information returns, and that’s just the in-development Form 1099-DA,” said Julie Foerster, IRS director of digital assets, during a meeting of the Council for Electronic Revenue Communication Advancement on Oct. 25, according to Tax Notes.  Foerster added that eight billion is greater than all other IRS-1099 forms currently processed combined. Eight billion is also the total number of men, women and children on Earth.  Blockchain is not the problem, it is the solution  Taxpayers already have many crypto-tax vendors to choose from when compiling information for their tax returns, such as Token Tax, Koinly and Zen Ledger. Due to the transparency and traceability of public blockchain transactions, users simply input their pseudonymous digital wallet addresses and receive a complete, itemized and forgery-proof record of their taxable trades from decentralized financial protocols along with cost-basis information.  The blockchain is the data of record without any need for reporting from a middleman. This approach is impossible in traditional finance due to the complete reliance on opaque private intermediaries (i.e., brokers), hence the need for IRS-1099 reporting from these private middlemen.  No sound reason  There is no sound reason for the Treasury and IRS to label an imaginary middleman and force that imaginary middleman to report DeFi trades and cost-basis tax information. There is no middleman in DeFi protocols, hence the innovation of this new technology.  See also: Why Regulators Must Understand, Not Police, DeFi | Opinion  DeFi users effectuate their own transactions using self-custodial digitals wallets. The IRS already has access to the underlying data from trades involving DeFi protocols through public blockchains of record. My proposed solution is not only possible but available today, as evidenced by vendors providing this service.  It would be exponentially more cost-efficient to society than processing eight billion unnecessary and duplicate IRS-1099 forms.  Unlike the proposed IRS rule, my approach would:  not eliminate DeFi protocols or self-custodial digital wallets that do not directly effectuate transactions (users effectuate their own transactions),  not exceed the authority granted by Congress under the law, and  still achieve the goals of better tax information reporting, compliance and increased tax revenue while mitigating privacy concerns.  True middlemen (e.g., Coinbase) would still be designated as brokers and be required to file tax information reports with the IRS. All U.S. crypto users must utilize a centralized exchange like Coinbase to on-board and off-board between the U.S. dollar and digital assets. These on/off ramps like Coinbase should be the focus of blockchain-based financial regulation, not autonomous software protocols without a genuine middleman.

42409521,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIQtt,1699886016,Crypto Tax Basics: A 101 for Beginners,"Welcome to the world of crypto taxes, where investors are finally starting to see black and white rules! It's crucial to understand the basics of crypto taxes to ensure you stay on the right side of the law, especially since the IRS is looking to crack down on crypto investors moving forward. In this beginner's guide, we'll break down the essentials in simple terms, making it easy for you to navigate the sometimes complex world of crypto taxation.  Here are some best practices.  This post is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week 2023. Jaimin Desai is the co-founder of Reconcile, a tax optimization platform helping investors, business owners and high-income earners pay less tax. He’s regularly written for WorkWeek, Bloomberg and CoinDesk.  Understand different transactions  Know the difference between buying, selling, and exchanging cryptocurrencies. Each type of transaction, particular in DeFi, may have different tax implications.  Read more: International Deal to Combat Crypto Tax Evasion to Start 2027 as 48 Countries Sign Up  For example, swapping one cryptocurrency for another is treated as a traditional sale of stock. So just going from BTC to ETH, even without cashing out to USD, still requires you to pay taxes if your BTC has appreciated in value.  Another scenario that causes lots of confusion and pain is airdrops. Airdrops are typically taxed at fair market value of receipt. So if you were airdropped 10 BTC for a total price of $100,000 on November 10, your taxable income would go up by that amount immediately. Even if you sold those 10 BTC the next day for $90,000, you would still report income of $100,000 and a capital loss of $10,000. Since the IRS only allows you to deduct $3,000 of capital losses every year, in this scenario, you can roll over the remaining $7,000 in future years.  Also, the IRS recently announced that they consider staking rewards to be taxable once received. Therefore, if you were awarded 1 ETH last year for $900 but only were able to sell it today (for some technical reason) when the price is closer to $1,800, your taxable income will increase by the latter amount.  Be mindful of holding periods  Understand the concept of holding periods. The length of time you hold a cryptocurrency can impact your tax rate. Short-term gains (held for less than a year) are taxed higher than long-term gains (held for longer than a year).  Consider professional help  If the crypto tax world seems overwhelming, don't hesitate to seek professional advice. Tax professionals with crypto expertise can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation and help you classify transactions properly to minimize your tax burden.  Read more: IRS 'Raided' by Crypto Investors as Industry Puts Up Fight Against U.S. Tax Proposal  Stay transparent with the IRS  Honesty is the best policy. Be transparent with the IRS about your crypto activities. Failing to report accurately can lead to penalties and legal complications. The recent IRS budget included a carve out to specifically target crypto cheats so be mindful of underreporting.  Stay organized throughout the year  Instead of scrambling during tax season, stay organized throughout the year. Regularly update your records after every transaction to ensure you have a clear picture of what you’ve been buying, selling, staking or gifting. The more you keep track in the moment, the less work you’ll have to do during tax season. The best way to stay organized is to note the date, amount and purpose so that you can properly classify the transactions at tax time.  Learn from recent cases  Stay informed about recent court cases related to crypto taxes. The most notable development is that the IRS finally clarified that staking rewards are taxable once received. By definition, ‘received’ means when the taxpayer has control over the assets and is able to sell their rewards.  As you embark on your crypto journey, remember that staying informed and proactive is key. By following these best practices, you can navigate the world of crypto taxes with confidence.

42409515,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIQWk,1699884555,The IRS Should Heed This Warning,"This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Tax Week, presented by TaxBit. Bill Hughes is senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters at Consensys.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may overplay their hand and, as a result, cripple the blockchain software industry in the U.S. It should change course.  The digital asset broker reporting law passed in 2021 is straightforward and sensible. There are plenty of intermediaries in the crypto ecosystem that execute transactions on behalf of millions of American digital asset investors. Just like it does in the traditional finance (“TradFi”) context, it makes a lot of sense for such businesses to inform not only their customers about what they owe in taxes but also the IRS, so they can ensure people pay what they owe.  The IRS’s proposed regulations that fill in all the important gaps in this reporting requirement unfortunately go far beyond this, however. All the gritty legal details were proposed on Aug. 25, and the public’s opportunity to comment on those proposals concludes Nov. 13.  The crypto community has certainly not wasted this opportunity, given that there are over 120,000 comments submitted, and those comments reveal a public that is very concerned the IRS has overstepped its statutory authority by expanding the application of this rule to entities that Congress did not intend to cover. This overreach risks placing unduly burdensome and often unachievable requirements on many entities.  The IRS should heed these warnings.  Specifically, the IRS proposes a new and complex regulatory scheme on software developers not accounting for blockchain technology’s unique technical and operational features. Many if not most of these parties have no historical experience with, offerings built around, or support systems for such reporting and would need to build compliance programs from scratch.  Software developers, from larger players such as Consensys to garage-band projects with a few engineers and a razor-thin budget, would need to dramatically overhaul their products and business practices to come into compliance if the proposed amendments are finalized in their current form.  IRS should stick to Congress’s instructions  These concerns can be largely avoided if the final regulations track the unequivocal intent of Congress to simply cut and paste the tax reporting regime from traditional finance. In making clear that digital-asset brokers are just like TradFi brokers for tax reporting purposes, Congress did not intend to overhaul the fundamental concept of a “broker.”  Amendment sponsor Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) in fact clarified on the floor of the Senate that brokers sell “on behalf of someone else” and do not simply engage in ancillary services. But the proposed rule would bring such an overhaul by treating as brokers not just those who act directly as dealers or agents in digital-asset transactions, but an amorphous category of “digital asset middlemen” that encompasses “any person who provides a facilitative service with respect to a sale of digital assets” where the nature of the service is such that “the person ordinarily would know or be in a position to know the identity of the party that makes the sale and the nature of the transaction potentially giving rise to the gross proceeds from the sale.”  I am somewhat optimistic that the IRS will work as carefully and diligently on revising it as they did during the two years it took to compose the first draft  Congress said a broker “effectuates” (meaning “carry into effect” or “accomplish”) a transaction, but the IRS reads that word to mean “being in a position to know.” One should be forgiven for wondering, is there a different English dictionary that only the IRS knows about? That is an impossible leap that the law does not permit an agency to make.  The proposal would require a massive change in the peer-to-peer blockchain software landscape in the U.S. Non-custodial entities would likely have to become custodians to satisfy tax withholding obligations, and offerings that scrupulously do not collect personally identifiable information about users of their software, a practice that MetaMask for instance takes very seriously, would be required to collect and store such sensitive data, even on non-U.S. users.  Operational impacts like these are wholly beyond the information reporting law that Congress passed. The IRS should not impose regulations that are so broad as to make policy decisions for digital assets in areas beyond the tax realm.  The IRS should also do what it can to reduce reporting burdens. It is therefore essential that the IRS adopt some form of a “multiple broker rule,” which reduces duplicative reporting by exempting certain parties more tangentially involved in a transaction. Yet the proposed rule dismisses this possibility, failing to recognize the tremendous inefficiency.  We should simply not accept duplicative reporting. It would lead to multiple withholdings for a single transaction, or to taxpayers being hopelessly confused by receiving multiple payee statements reporting the same transaction. The purpose of this reporting law is to make it easier for taxpayers to decipher how much they owe, not harder.  The IRS, too, would be overburdened if it is inundated with multiple returns for each transaction, particularly because the IRS may not be able to identify when reporting is duplicative.  Exclude certain assets in certain situations  Further, serious consideration should be given to excluding digital assets outside of the investment context. . For example, as the IRS itself recognizes, many non-fungible tokens (NFTs) simply offer “ownership or license interests in artwork or sports memorabilia” analogous to physical souvenirs. So the IRS should limit reporting requirements for non-investment NFTs, such as by requiring reporting only for transactions occurring on trading platforms. Currently, every NFT sale or swap would potentially be a reportable transaction, a rule that would severely hamper growth in new commercial applications for NFTs.  For the same reasons, the IRS should also exclude stablecoins credibly pegged to a fixed value of the U.S. dollar, as such stablecoins are designed to have a constant value and their disposition generally should give rise to no meaningful gain or loss in the vast majority of cases. An exclusion along these lines would track the IRS’s practice in other contexts. At most, the IRS could require stablecoin reporting where explicit trading activity around stablecoins is conducted, for instance in order to capture gains when a stablecoin deviates from its designated peg. No good reason exists to require stablecoin reporting more generally.  See also: How the Crypto Industry Responded to the IRS Proposed Broker Rule  The IRS should similarly add a de minimis exception from reporting and backup withholding in instances where any gain or loss is likely to be marginal and/or for small value transactions. This would align with Congress’s intent that the IRS focus on transactions with meaningful realization potential, help lessen the administrative burdens of this new reporting regime and maintain consistency with the IRS’s approach in other areas of its regulations.  An unworkable regime would be unlawful  It is well-established that agency regulation is arbitrary and capricious, and thus unlawful, if compliance would be unworkable. And, for blockchain software developers, this rule is generally unworkable, requiring substantial changes to their operating models.  We at Consensys did some back of the envelope math on the work that redesigning our offerings, systems and business practices would entail. The results, which are undoubtedly a low estimate given that many of the regulatory specifications remain unknown today, are staggering. We would need scores of employees working not months but years on this, spending at least two orders of magnitude more money than what the IRS estimates it would cost the average digital asset broker. And despite all this effort, there are requirements that would remain beyond our control to satisfy.  But what about those developers that are not as heavily staffed or well resourced? You can expect many, if not most, to buckle under the weight of these requirements. That is a terrifying notion in light of the IRS’s own estimate that 98% of the new brokers under its rules would be small businesses. The rule would be akin to a persistent forest fire that immolates all of the newly sprouting plants, leaving only the scorched larger trees.  IRS may pare back this rule  Congress adopted a simple information reporting requirement. The IRS may not use that requirement to affect in ways well beyond the tax realm how peer-to-peer software is offered, or to set policy over digital assets generally. But that is very much what this rule would do in practice.  See also: IRS Proposed Rule on Digital Asset Brokers Could Kill U.S. Crypto  Despite the overreach with the initial proposal, I am somewhat optimistic that the IRS will work as carefully and diligently on revising it as they did during the two years it took to compose the first draft. This regime will be an important one for digital asset investors generally and for the national fisc, and the IRS has a difficult task balancing all of the competing concerns appropriately. That they do a good job is crucial to the further development of a new technological frontier that the U.S. should play a preeminent role in exploring.  I have hope that these issues will be corrected and a workable reporting regime will ultimately be what we get. They deserve our continued input and support.

42409531,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIRH2,1699884307,The Tax Implications of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Conviction,"On November 2, 2023, Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all counts in his federal criminal trial in the Southern District of New York.  The most recent superseding indictment was filed on August 14, 2023, and included seven criminal counts such as wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy counts related to those activities.  This post is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week, presented by TaxBit.  After a multi-week trial, SBF was found guilty on all counts. An appeal of this conviction is likely; plus, the sentencing phase of the prosecution is not scheduled to occur until early 2024. So the saga is not over yet.  But his conviction does provide, in its own way, some clarity for FTX customers waiting to figure out where they stand in the FTX bankruptcy proceeding and the tax treatment of any losses incurred.  The joint FTX bankruptcy  Since November 2022, the myriad of FTX affiliated companies, including Alameda Research, FTX,com (the offshore trading platform), and FTX.us (the U.S. trading platform), have been operating as debtors in bankruptcy.  Customers of both FTC.com and FTX.us have been in a holding pattern with little certainty as to whether they will receive any of their account holdings back either in fiat or crypto.  On July 31, 2023, the debtors filed a draft Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. The draft plan includes a number of upfront qualifiers alerting readers that it is likely to change over time as more information is uncovered, agreements are reached, and assets are discovered and moved back into the bankruptcy estate.  With that said, the draft plan does provide a framework for creditors holding claims against the debtors, including FTX.com and FTX.us customers. Importantly, this clearly indicates that customers will likely not be made whole and that any payout is almost certainly to be received in cash. There is a possibility for an alternate payout with respect to FTX.com customers, but that is only referenced in a footnote.  The draft plan segregates FTX.com and FTX.us customers into two distinct creditor pools, anticipating that funds to pay those pools will be based, at least initially, on fiat accounts or crypto wallets held in the names of each respective entity.  The IRS may use the impropriety of that activity to deny any losses claimed  It also carves out creditors with claims based on FTT token or NFT holdings on the debtor exchanges. These creditors are treated separately from the generic FTX.com and FTX.us customer-claimants. Of course, a creditor may hold multiple claims.  Ultimately, creditors are still in a holding pattern as to when and how much of a payout they will receive in bankruptcy. Because creditors are likely not going to me made whole, customers subject to U.S. tax will have questions regarding what tax deductions may be available to mitigate the economic loss incurred.  As explained below, SBF’s conviction likely solidifies one of the most difficult hurdles to overcome for those looking to deduct any losses on their U.S. tax returns — the existence of a theft.  Claiming tax losses  It is important to note that the bankruptcy proceeding begun by FTX in November 2022 did nothing for tax purposes. At that time, nothing had actually been lost by any customer. The bankruptcy filing simply put all activities on pause until the administrators of the bankrupt debtors — FTX’s new management — could figure out what assets FTX and its affiliates held so a plan could be proposed on how to dissolve the companies and pay out as much value as possible to creditors.  Under the tax code, as it has existed since 2018, the amount of a loss can only be deducted in limited circumstances.  As it relates to crypto, a taxpayer could deduct a loss resulting from the bankruptcy if:  The taxpayer was in the trade or business of trading crypto; or  The taxpayer was engaged in the trading of crypto for the production of income and the loss stemmed from a theft.  Generally, the tax code has a pretty high standard for individual’s looking to characterize their trading activity as a trade or business. This avenue likely applies to only a few of FTX’s customers.  Most customers, however, would easily be able to show that their activity on FTX was directed at making the production of income. It is unlikely that the IRS would challenge this characterization since investing activities have traditionally been characterized as activities done for the production of income.  The draft plan segregates FTX.com and FTX.us customers into two distinct creditor pools  Until SBF’s conviction, the second part was uncertain. Since 2018, deductions for losses need to relate to both the production of income and be the result of a theft. Under the tax code, claiming that a loss is the result of a theft is much more difficult than just saying it was a theft. A taxpayer generally needs to show that a criminal theft occurred.  For the majority of customers-turned-creditors in the wave of crypto-related bankruptcies over the past year, many are grappling with whether their ultimate losses can be characterized as thefts. SBF’s conviction now provides certainty on this front. In light of his conviction and the evidence introduced during the trial, taxpayers are in a good position to claim that losses incurred on either FTX.com or FTX.us were the result of a theft.  Even with this step of the analysis resolved, taxpayers will still need to wait before deducting any losses because the losses are not deductible until there is reasonable certainty as to if or how much of a recovery will be made because that recovery reduces the amount of the loss that can be claimed.  As a closing thought, U.S. taxpayers who are creditors of FTX.com, rather than FTX.us, should speak to their tax advisors about any loss deductions being sought. U.S. individuals were not supposed to be using FTX.com as it was an offshore entity not subject to U.S. jurisdiction, which means activity on that exchange was technically not legal. Although no criminal charges are likely to be brought against U.S. individuals who improperly used FTX.com, the IRS may use the impropriety of that activity to deny any losses claimed.  Tax law in the U.S. has long recognized the government’s ability to deny a tax deduction on public policy grounds where the deduction arose in the context of illegal activity. The court opinions tackling these issues have some mixed outcomes generally based on the facts, but there are cases holding that theft losses incurred during the context of illegal activity are not deductible on public policy grounds.  It is not clear if the IRS would try to take such a position with respect to losses claimed by U.S. users of FTX.com but it is a question that should be discussed with your tax advisor before claiming such a loss.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Miles Fuller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/13/the-tax-implications-of-sam-bankman-frieds-conviction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7546d8a130bdd44c35c91953b8dbbcad9666cf0-2048x1057.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20137085,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560363,1699884025,"Chainlink Forms Sell Signal, Analyst Predicts Pullback To This Level","An analyst has pointed out how Chainlink is forming a TD Sequential sell signal right now, which could lead to a retracement to this level. Chainlink Could Decline To $12.50 Following The Sell Signal As explained by analyst Ali in a new post on X, LINK could be heading toward a correction based on what the TD Sequential signal says. The “Tom Demark (TD) Sequential” is a popular indicator in technical analysis that is used to pinpoint reversals in the price of any asset (which, in the current discussion, is naturally Chainlink). The metric gives a signal whenever the asset has seen nine candles following a reversal in its price. The signal is a sell one if the candles are green, while it’s a buy one if the candles are red. Related Reading: Is A Bearish Reversal Coming For Bitcoin? This Metric May Warn So This phase is called the “setup phase.” Once the setup is done, a 13-candle long countdown phase kicks off. At the end of these 13 candles, the price could be believed to have hit another probable bottom or top (depending on whether the phase started with a sell or buy signal). Chainlink has recently been enjoying some very rapid growth, which has led to the asset’s price hitting heights not seen since April of last year. This run, however, may be going toward at least a temporary setback, as according to Ali, a TD Sequential setup phase seems to have finished for the cryptocurrency recently. The signal has in fact appeared on not just one, but three of the coin’s price charts: daily, 3-day, and weekly. Here are the charts as shared by the analyst: LINK appears to have completed a TD-9 setup | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the Chainlink TD Sequential setup phase has finished with green candles on all of these LINK charts, implying a reversal towards the bearish side may be imminent for the cryptocurrency. Ali anticipates that the retracement would be towards the $12.50 level, which would mean a drawdown of more than 18% from the current price level of the asset. “Failing to hold above this critical support area could extend the losses to $10.50,” the analyst further adds. Such a decline all the way to $10.50 would suggest a decrease of over 31% for Chainlink, but even if such a steep drop happens, LINK still wouldn’t have fully undone the recovery it has made since the last third of October, showing just how sharp the asset’s bullish momentum has been recently. Related Reading: Ethereum At $2,100: Why Path To $2,500 Is Now All Clear It now remains to be seen what trajectory the asset takes from here considering this bearish signal. So far, chances are not looking in the favor of the coin, as it has seen two red candles already since the pattern has formed, implying that the countdown phase might have begun.

42409524,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIR0V,1699882200,IRS 'Raided' by Crypto Investors as Industry Puts Up Fight Against U.S. Tax Proposal,"The Internal Revenue Service's audio-only hearing today will draw views from the crypto industry on what threats the digital assets advocates see embedded in the proposed new tax approach being contemplated for cryptocurrencies.  The concerns include user privacy, the scope of crypto entities that would have to report transaction information, the inclusion of stablecoins and whether the proposal implies anything about whether digital assets should be counted as securities.  The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is gathering the final words now from a crypto sector that is arguing the agency's proposal for a digital-assets taxation regime is an existential threat to investor privacy and to decentralized crypto projects.  After a comment deadline and a public hearing on Monday, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's tax arm will have a mountain of more than 120,000 comments to sift through – aided in some instances by the wordsmithing of artificial intelligence tied to such campaigns as the LeXpunK Army's ""Treasury Raid.""  Monday's hearing – confined to audio – will gather prominent crypto advocates to lay out their arguments on this proposal that maps out how crypto brokers and investors would report transactions to the IRS.  Read more: Crypto Tax Basics: A 101 for Beginners  The new taxation system – which won't become final until IRS officials weigh the input, rewrite a final version and approve it – has drawn industry ire that's partially focused on how the proposal would define a ""broker"" that needs to comply.  ""The digital asset middleman category stretches the statutory language beyond its breaking point in direct contravention of the relevant legislative history,"" the DeFi Education Fund argued in a comment letter. The current language of the proposal ""inexorably leads to the conclusion that the proposed regulations could treat every participant in the blockchain technology stack as a broker.""  DeFi  By intentionally roping in some decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), wallet providers and certain payment processors, the IRS may be trying to require tax information from organizations that would have difficulty providing it.  A comment from Americans for Tax Reform says the government's scope for brokers is pursuing ""a broad definition that includes entities incapable of reporting the applicable transactional information."" The group argued that ""the IRS wants to rope DeFi into the reporting regime to ensure that other entities do not convert to DeFi entities and circumvent reporting requirements.""  Another frequent industry concern was for investor privacy when it comes to government reporting of transactions, which crypto brokerage Coinbase (COIN) argued ""would impose an unprecedented, unchecked and unlimited tracking on the daily lives of Americans,"" according to a comment letter from Lawrence Zlatkin, the company's vice president for tax. He contended that the regulations as written would allow ""government surveillance of the choices Americans make about their most private health care decisions, or even when they purchase a cup of coffee.""  Bright side  Despite the objections, there is a general bright side for a crypto taxation approach in the U.S. Establishing rules and forms for how investors report their gains would eliminate one of the central impediments toward wider interest in cryptocurrencies: uncertainty over how to figure out what one owes in taxes. The proposal would establish a bespoke tax form, akin to the 1099s stock market investors are used to dealing with.  Were an IRS rule to pass before any of the crypto proposals from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it would clear the first major hurdle in U.S. crypto regulation: establishing an official status for digital assets in U.S. finance, even as Congress continues to stumble in its debate over future crypto markets laws.  Federal agencies are compelled to review all comments in the process of giving birth to a new rule, and the incredible volume for this proposal could demand more time than usual to complete that task. Tens of thousands of individuals provided objections.  Other complaints with the proposal focused on its inclusion of stablecoins as reportable assets and its relationship with defining securities.  To avoid this rule reinforcing the argument that digital assets are securities, Nicolas Morgan, president of the Investor Choice Advocates Network, asked the Treasury Department to make it clear that this rule wouldn't apply to securities law.

42409533,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIRNe,1699881746,First Mover Americas: Grayscale’s GBTC Discount Narrows to 10%,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) discount to its net asset value (NAV) has narrowed to levels not seen since July 2021, data from YCharts shows. The discount to NAV, currently around 10.35%, has been shrinking from a record of almost 50% during the depths of the FTX-induced crypto winter in December last year. Last week, CoinDesk reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated discussions with Grayscale Investments about converting the trust to a spot bitcoin ETF, which, if successful, would provide significant market momentum and liquidity. Bitcoin fund holdings have reached an all-time high, driven by investor enthusiasm over the anticipated approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., with total inflows exceeding $1 billion this year, CoinDesk recently reported. Grayscale Investments and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.  Bankrupt crypto lender Genesis has agreed to settle $1 billion in claims by defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) with a payment of $33 million, court documents show. The hedge fund's collapse in June 2022 marked the first storm in a long crypto winter, and its claims against Genesis refer to transfers made prior to the lender's own bankruptcy in January. The deal, set out in a filing from Nov. 9, follows ""extensive negotiations,"" between the parties, and Genesis is seeking a New York bankruptcy court's go-ahead to settle the claims. ""The 3AC Debtor shall receive an allowed general unsecured claim against Genesis in the amount of $33,000,000 in full and complete satisfaction of the more than $1 billion dollars in claims asserted against each of the Genesis Debtors,"" the document said, adding that the agreement will ""mutually release each other from liability.""  Excitement about the potential approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETF) has fueled a strong rally in digital assets over the past month, but the move higher seems overdone, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report last week. Bullish sentiment has been buoyed by two main arguments, the bank said. “A spot bitcoin ETF approval would help crypto markets to attract fresh/new capital as the newly-approved ETFs see inflows,” and the “approval would cement a win for the crypto industry and a setback for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) thus making it more likely that going forward the SEC approach towards the crypto industry will soften,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.

42409532,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcIRKL,1699881624,Hacker Steals $27M in Tether From Wallet Linked to Binance Deployer,"A hacker stole $27 million worth of tether [USDT] from a wallet linked to the Binance deployer over the weekend, according to blockchain analyst ZachXBT.  The $27 million loot was converted to ether [ETH] before being sent to exchanges FixedFloat and ChangeNow. All funds were then bridged to bitcoin [BTC] via the THORChain bridge.  According to on-chain data, the victim's wallet had received ether via two separate wallets from the Binance deployer in 2019.  ""The user made a withdrawal from Binance, which was valid and authorized on our platform. Unfortunately, the DeFi wallet that received the withdrawal was compromised. While this is outside of our scope of control, Binance's security team is looking into the matter and we will provide assistance where we can,"" a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk.  A deployer wallet is a wallet used to create smart contracts. Binance's deployer wallet has been inactive since December, 2020.  THORChain has become an epicenter for hack-related activity over the course of the year – in June hackers that stole $35 million from Atomic Wallet used THORChain to conceal the ill-gotten gains, and last month THORSwap put its platform into maintenance mode after a series of FTX hack-related trades.  Exchanges are often the target of hackers. Last week Poloniex lost $114 million after a hack breached that exchange's hot wallets.

Prices of Grok (GROK) have more than doubled in the past 24 hours, according to DEXTools, extending a week-long rally to 13,000% – a move that turned every $100 invested into $13,100.  The GROK token has 11,000 holders and saw $25 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours. This particular token was the first of scores of other GROK tokens created by developers across several blockchains – most have apparently either rugpulled or failed to gain in value after issuance.  Top GROK holders are sitting on $2.1 million to over $6 million in unrealized profits, as per DEXTools data. However, available liquidity for the GROK-USD pair is just $3.5 million as of Monday, meaning a single large sell could completely topple the rise.  Grok, an AI chatbot service by social application X started to roll out last Saturday. Previews show the service is relatively more uncensored – and humorous – than existing players, which has seemingly helped it quickly gain a cult following.  Anyone can call a smart contract and issue tokens on Ethereum (or other blockchains) for a few cents, and the presence of decentralized exchanges means tokens can instantly be issued, supplied with liquidity and traded soon after.  All grok tokens are unrelated to and unaffiliated with the actual Grok AI service.

However, Chief Economist Peter Schiff is of another thought and is of the idea that a BTC price crash is on the horizon even before the SEC gives the green light on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Economist Peter Schiff Warns of Potential Bitcoin Crash Schiff created a poll on social media recently and asked his more than 980,000 followers to vote on a timeline for the next Bitcoin crash. The poll attracted a total of 24,599 votes, with the majority of respondents indicating that they anticipate a decline in price well after spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved. However, a majority (68.1%) choose the “Buy and HODL till the moon” option, indicating the long-term holding sentiment of many BTC traders. Related Reading: New All-Time Highs For Bitcoin In 2023? Analyst Shares Ultra Bullish Prediction When will #Bitcoin crash? — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 9, 2023 Schiff disagreed with the outcome of this poll voted on by his followers. The economist is of the notion that the results pointed to a crash before the ETF launch despite the option receiving only 8.9% of votes. Based on the results my guess is that Bitcoin crashes before the ETF launch. That why the people who bought the rumor won’t actually profit if they wait for the fact to sell. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 10, 2023 This thought process is definitely not what Bitcoin bulls want to hear right now, as the post attracted comments disagreeing with Schiff. One user stated, “I would say that based on your results 70% of your followers hold #Bitcoin, that should tell you something.” Why Does Peter Schiff Predict a Crash Before ETF Approvals? Schiff had made a post last month during Bitcoin’s climb above $30,000 to give some sort of explanation on his thought process. According to him, investors are buying BTC now because they expect more investors to rush in once spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved. But there could be more people waiting to sell and make a profit on the price influx. This statement could be somewhat true, as BTC could crash if holders decide to sell their assets during soaring prices. As expected, many investors disagreed with him. Speculators are buying #Bitcoin now because they think other speculators are waiting to buy a #BitcoinETF. They will soon discover that there are far more speculators waiting to sell then waiting to buy! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 23, 2023 Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Machine Learning Algorithm Reveals December Target Schiff has been known to make comments contradicting market sentiment around Bitcoin. A post made as far back as November 2018 showed the economist saying Bitcoin could crash from $3,800 to $750. The cryptocurrency would go ahead to reach $13,000 in the months after. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that buying #Bitcoin below $3,800 is a bargain just because the current price is better than 80% below its record high. Bitcoin’s price could easily drop another 80% from here, and at $750 it would still be expensive! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) November 25, 2018 The Bullish Case For Spot Bitcoin ETFs With SEC approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs seemingly on the horizon, the bullish case for Bitcoin is building. The introduction of spot ETFs will usher in a new wave of investors and inject new money into BTC that could drive prices far higher long term. The SEC has reportedly set a window from November 8 to 17 to decide on applications, but the industry could see the decision delayed until January 2024.

The trust's shares are priced at $202 following a 653% rise since the start of September, while the SOL token trebled to $58 from $19. CoinGlass shows it holds 115,900 tokens ($6.78 million) on behalf of its clients.  The widening premium comes after the underlying asset, SOL, surged 20% on Friday. Positive sentiment continues to build after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on seven counts of fraud earlier this month. The token was dubbed one of the ""Sam Coins"" before the exchange's collapse because it had invested millions into the ecosystem and built Serum, a decentralized exchange, on the Solana network.  Institutional interest in crypto has experienced an uptick over the past few months, with CME, the venue that is preferred by institutions, overtaking Binance in terms of derivatives market share. The increase can be attributed to optimism around the potential approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, something that the SEC has consistently denied over the past few years. Grayscale is the only institutional on-ramp for Solana because only bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH] are listed on CME.  Grayscale Investments and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.  SOL lost 80% of its value in a two-month period following FTX's implosion last November; It has since risen by more than 590% from a low of $8, according to TradingView.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL | BNB,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/13/grayscales-solana-trust-trades-at-869-premium-as-institutions-flock-to-sol,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1821f5d27f331c93ab5d82a8d0f395b39e56cfc6-1172x784.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20133686,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560382,1699876840,XRP Will Diverge Away From Price Speculation: Crypto Pundit,"In a recent analysis, crypto analyst “Flip The Chain” highlighted insights from Michele Worthington, a project manager and designer for San Francisco’s properties and luxury homes. Worthington’s comments, primarily focused on XRP, present a detailed view of the digital currency’s future beyond mere market speculation. XRP Set To Break Free From Speculative Pricing Worthington’s analysis begins with a clear distinction: “While XRP’s pricing is currently driven by speculation, akin to many other tokens including Bitcoin, it’s poised for a significant shift. As the financial payments sector, historically slow in adopting digital technologies, progresses, XRP’s pricing mechanism will diverge from these speculative trends.” According to her, this change will make XRP immune to traditional market fluctuations, crypto-related events like the Bitcoin halving events, or “sporadic” news cycles. She outlines XRP’s unique advantages for banking and financial institutions. “XRP stands out for its ability to execute bank payments in mere seconds at a fraction of the cost. To illustrate, a cross-border transfer of $50M can be done for as little as 30 cents. Such efficiency is pivotal in the financial sector.” Related Reading: XRP Price Outlook: Expert Forecasts Potential Rise To $5.5 The integration of XRP with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is highlighted by Worthington as a key factor for its future trajectory. She notes, “The synchronization of international compliances and regulations is crucial for CBDCs to effectively integrate with XRP. This has been the focus of numerous pilot tests and partnerships, leading to the adoption of the ISO20022 standard. The standard is set to debut on November 19, with a transition period until late 2025.” 2024: A Pivotal Year For Ripple She also draws attention to Ripple’s strategic preparations for this shift. Ripple has formed a network of global alliances, including in “Japan, Australia, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Africa, Switzerland, Dubai, UAE, BRICS as well as with the BIS, IMF and more.” According to her, this sets the stage for 2024 as a pivotal year. Once the banking sector integrates with XRP, the influence of retail investors on its price will become negligible,” claims Worthington: When the banks plug in, the small retail investor won’t make a dent in the price. Each XRP has to be a very high value to move a large part of the $7 trillion daily on the FX market worldwide. Moreover, Worthington also highlights XRP’s potential in the tokenization of diverse assets, such as bonds and real estate, underscoring its non-exclusivity but significant role in handling substantial volumes, making the XRP token even more valuable. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 2450% XRP Price Surge Following Bullish Crossover On liquidity solutions, Worthington states, “XRP’s testing with over 30 central banks showcases its ability to alleviate liquidity challenges, particularly in transactions involving less liquid currencies.” She concludes, “The role of XRP in currency transportation is unparalleled, especially in terms of scalability, interoperability, and liquidity. Its emergence as a revolutionary element in the financial sector is not just probable but imminent. XRP transports the currency. No other token can do this on this scale of interoperability with this kind of liquidity. It’s revolutionary.” It’s important to note that the views and predictions shared by Michele Worthington represent her individual perspective on XRP’s future. As with any analysis, her insights should be considered as part of a wider range of expert opinions and not as definitive forecasts. At press time, XRP traded at $0.6536.

Grayscale Ethereum Trust offers a wider NAV spread and may be subsequently approved on similar grounds by the SEC. Risks include a potential decline in crypto assets, wiping out any bump from ETF conversion. I believe it is highly likely that the SEC will soon approve various spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs, perhaps in January 2024 or earlier, and then move to approve similar spot Ethereum ETFs with a similar rationale. This is based on a legal ruling on August 29, 2023 (Grayscale v. SEC, 22-1142, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit), which the SEC has not appealed, and the window for an appeal expired in October 2023 . The ruling stated that ""agencies must treat like cases alike"" and the SEC's decision to allow two Bitcoin futures ETF but block Grayscale's spot Bitcoin ETF was ""arbitrary and capricious."" I think this is also increasingly the view of informed market participants, but despite this potential catalyst, the NAV discount remains material, leaving some upside should ETF conversion occur. I think Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) is more interesting at these levels given a wider discount to NAV at the time of writing. The main risk of this strategy is that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have rallied significantly on the prospect of a spot ETF driving additional crypto demand. Therefore, if there is no spot ETF, then the discount to NAV would likely widen and the price of the underlying fund holdings may well decline. ETF Conversion Opportunity It's important to note that, here, I'm focused on more of a 'dirty arb' setup, where conversion of a fund at a discount to NAV into an ETF wrapper will necessarily close virtually all of the discount to NAV. The closing of the discount to NAV is simply a fact of how ETFs operate. Wide NAV discounts can't persist in ETFs, otherwise, ETF units are bought and the underlying asset is sold until the NAV gap closes (and vice-versa if the ETF trades above NAV). That's a potentially profitable trade for funds too, but typically fund structures don't build in those trades to keep the fund close to NAV. I'm not focused on swings in crypto per se, though that is a risk to the trade, since changes in crypto values will impact the returns to the trade. For now, enthusiasm that Bitcoin will have a spot ETF from major providers has been a contributing factor in Bitcoin's rally. However, even though I like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ), I like Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) more as the NAV spread is currently wider, even if approval may come perhaps 4 months later. Fund Price/share NAV/share Return if NAV discount closed today Deadline for SEC to approve/reject filings* GBTC (Bitcoin) $29.97 $33.43 +11.5% Jan 10 2024 ETHE (Ethereum) $17.22 $20.01 +16.2% May 17, 2024 Author's analysis, pricing, and NAV will change dynamically. *Estimated approval date is based on Ark Invest filings with a 240-day comment period after publication in the Federal Register on May 8, 2023, for Bitcoin ETF (filing from Ark) and publication in the Federal Register on September 20, 2023 for an Ethereum ETF (filing from Van Eck) other funds could be approved/rejected later or earlier, though 'across the board' approval/rejection may be more likely as being viewed as a fairer approach for the ETF sponsors and is an approach that the SEC has taken in the past such as with six Ethereum futures ETFs launched on October 2, 2023. Approval/rejection could also occur prior to the deadline. Risks One way to think about this is how much the crypto assets would have to decline for the trade to lose money if the ETF conversion is approved. For Bitcoin, an 11% decline would wipe out any profits, and for Ethereum, a 14% decline would do the same. The relatively high fees of the Grayscale fund products (2% of NAV annually) would eat into returns too. Of course, given volatility in crypto assets, losing money despite ETF conversion is clearly possible. Then of course there is the risk that the spot ETFs are not approved. Some believe the SEC will be able to use further technical arguments to block spot crypto ETFs. I view this as unlikely in light of the legal ruling, which left little ambiguity. The court was clear that the SEC should not block a spot Bitcoin ETF when a futures Bitcoin ETF exists. Therefore, pretty much anything else the SEC might try would fall foul of that legal decision. Plus as a government entity, such as the SEC, presumably, you take the law seriously and don't want to lose in court, which limits your credibility and authority. The only thing, in my view, that the SEC could likely do would be to reverse its decision on allowing a Bitcoin futures ETF, though that would be bizarre behavior and the SEC appears to be seriously reviewing the SEC filings currently. For example, you can see Ark progressively updating its S-1 filings for a Bitcoin ETF here and here over recent months. This is believed to be, in part, in response to SEC feedback. This recent interview with SEC Chair Gensler , contained limited information of substance, except that the SEC does seem to be actively reviewing the disclosures of the Bitcoin proposals, which updates to the S-1 filings support. Then I've mentioned that I view the Grayscale Ethereum Trust as the more attractive play given the slightly wider spread and an ultimately similar outlook for spot ETF approval. Of course, there's a risk that the SEC approves a Bitcoin ETF without a similar approval for Ethereum. However, the recent Ripple ruling where the SEC lost too, and again saw an appeal blocked, suggests that the SEC may have to treat Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple somewhat consistently as assets that are now more part of the financial mainstream and less speculative Ponzi schemes. Still, there's a risk that the SEC decides to block a spot Ethereum ETF while permitting a spot Bitcoin ETF. Though even here, Ethereum Futures ETF exists , so the SEC may have a hard time blocking an Ethereum spot ETF on the logic of the Bitcoin ruling. Limitations I believe Grayscale's core funds of Bitcoin and Ethereum will convert to ETFs no later than H1 2024. However, I think the expectation that a broader set of Grayscale funds convert to ETFs is less certain. That's in part because Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two Grayscale funds with billions in assets. Other funds are far smaller and less significant by comparison. Furthermore, other funds contain assets like Litecoin, Filecoin, Solana, etc. Here the SEC has not blessed these crypto assets as being robust and relatively lower risk in the same way that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple now have legal/regulatory precedents. As such, it is not obvious that the SEC will grant ETF conversion for the 'longer tail' of crypto assets and Grayscale has not filed to do so. Therefore, I think there's a case to be made that these other funds convert at some point in the future, but there are material risks and the timeline is unclear. Conclusion Normally, when ETFs are filed by major providers they are approved by the SEC after a review period. The only reason crypto is different is because the SEC made a ruling blocking a spot Bitcoin ETF, that has now been vacated by the courts. We are now in some sense back to 'normal' with these ETF filings where approval after a review period involving some back and forth with the SEC is, in my view, the most likely outcome. I believe it now appears highly likely that ETF conversion will occur within months, if not sooner, closing NAV discounts for potential double-digit returns. That said, price movement in the underlying crypto assets remains a very real risk and could change the return profile of this strategy. This could create a loss even if conversion occurs, so hedging of the underlying assets might be warranted. I would also argue that this trade is less correlated to the broader equity market, which may be useful to some investors.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4651145-grayscale-ethereum-trust-attractive-read-across-from-bitcoin-etf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20131948.jpeg

20131664,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560374,1699873216,"Avalanche (AVAX) Rumbles With 45% Rally, Rules Top 20 Coin Listing Today","Throughout the majority of the year, the Avalanche (AVAX) coin has seen a predominantly bearish trend. However, it has recently exhibited a noteworthy resurgence. Avalanche has demonstrated remarkable performance within the cryptocurrencies sector, exhibiting a significant increase of 10% during the past 24 hours. The AVAX price, which is currently valued at $18.12, exhibits a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern. From an optimistic perspective, the escalating demand has the potential to drive the bullish trend to surpass the $20 threshold. Related Reading: Mysterious Wallet Transfers 18 Million MATIC To Coinbase – What’s Going On? AVAX shows an impressive figure in the weekly timeframe. Source: CoinMarkeCap Indeed, the recent surge of 45% in the altcoin’s value over the past week has facilitated its ascendancy to the apex of the current top 20 coin rankings. The AVAX cryptocurrency is now experiencing an upward trajectory, with its objective being the reacquisition of the $20 threshold. Will the cryptocurrency surge persist, leading AVAX to exceed the $20 mark, or is a potential retracement on the horizon? The price of Avalanche has recently increased substantially for three key reasons. First off, it had a significant increase subsequent to the announcement made by Coinbase on its plans to incorporate support for AVAX and SOL perpetual futures contracts. In the majority of instances, the value of cryptocurrencies experiences a significant increase following their inclusion on one of the largest global exchanges. Secondly, the success of the token’s rise is consistent with that of other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Solana, Chainlink, and Bitcoin. Supporters of a spot Bitcoin ETF are jubilant about its possible approval. Additionally, Blackrock submitted an application for an Ethereum ETF last week. Related Reading: Boom! Cronos Unleashes 57% Weekend Explosion, Beating All In The Top 100 Crypto Ranking Investors thus anticipate that entities such as Blackrock, Invesco, and Grayscale would apply for additional token ETFs as their next course of action. Avalanche will be a great one to see if this occurs due of its enormous scale. AVAX price action in the last 24-hours. Source: CoinMarketCap Avalanche has gained significant popularity on numerous social media platforms. Further evidence indicates that there has been a notable upward trend in the open interest of futures. The total revenue reached a peak of more than $156 million throughout the course of the weekend. Bybit, OKX, and Bybit accounted for the remainder of this open interest, after Binance. A significant increase in futures open interest generally indicates heightened demand. As the cryptocurrency community eagerly watches AVAX’s ascent, the question remains: will it maintain its momentum and breach the $20 mark, or is a retracement on the horizon? Time will tell as the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

The exchange aims to list on Kosdaq, the South Korean counterpart to Nasdaq, though it is also open to an initial public offering (IPO) on the country's main stock market, the Kospi, The Korea Herald reported, citing a Bithumb official.  ""We selected Samsung Securities as our manager for initial public offering. We aim to go public during the second half of 2025,"" the official said.  The IPO would mark the first such listing by a Korean crypto exchange. There were reports in 2020 that Bithumb was considering a share sale, though it denied them at the time. Bithumb is aiming to boost its market share and close the gap on fellow exchange Upbit, which has more than 80% of the South Korean market.  South Korea's government set upon a crackdown of the crypto industry in 2021 in an attempt to tackle fraud and other illegal activities. Bithumb's offices were raided at the start of this year as part of a probe into price manipulation of an unspecified digital asset.  Crypto trading in South Korea remains healthy, however, with Upbit surpassing Coinbase and OKX in August to become the world's second-largest crypto exchange after Binance.

20129663,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560367,1699869638,"Bitcoin Price Hard Crash Or Mega Pump: Why $31,000 Holds The Key","The Bitcoin price has been trading in a tight range around the $37,000 price level through the weekend. This tight trading suggests that there is a lot of fighting going on right now between the bulls and the bears as each camp tries to gain an upper hand over the other. As this tug of war continues, a crypto analyst has presented the most important level that will determine whether the bulls or the bears will claim dominance. $31,000 Is The Magic Number For The Bitcoin Price Crypto analyst Ben Vouh took to TradingView to share their analysis of where the price of Bitcoin will be depending on whether the price stays above or below $31,000. According to the analyst, this level is the most important determinant factor for whether the Bitcoin price will continue its uptrend or crash back below $20,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Confirms Dogecoin Price Breakout – Here’s The Target The two scenarios presented include whether the Bitcoin price closes the week above or below $31,000. If Bitcoin were to close the week below the $31,000 level, then Vouh expects a massive crash to follow. This crash could see the price fall to $18,400, as illustrated in the analyst’s chart. Source: Tradingview.com For the second scenario, if the Bitcoin price is able to close the week above $31,000, then the crypto analyst expects the uptrend of the last few weeks to continue, putting the top above the $42,000 mark. This would translate to another 20% move for the cryptocurrency’s value. Source: Tradingview.com The crypto analyst highlights the fact that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is sitting very high. At a score of 72, the crypto market is firmly in greed, which is a sentiment score that has often preceded crypto market crashes. Given this, the analyst advises investors to be careful during this time. “I would recommend to just hodl and wait,” Vouh said. BTC Starts Out The Week On A Slow Note With the new trading week opening up, the Bitcoin price has not exactly started off on the most bullish note. It is trading below $37,000 as of the time of this writing and is seeing 0.46% losses on the daily chat. This could mean that investors are currently watching to see what happens next before making their next move. Related Reading: New All-Time Highs For Bitcoin In 2023? Analyst Shares Ultra Bullish Prediction The Fear & Greed Index has reached its highest level in 2023 so far, with a score of 74 on November 6. While prices have not begun to tank, there could be a crash on the horizon as the analyst points out. One example of this was on April 16, 2023, when the Fear & Greed Index reached a peak of 68. In the next few days, the price would fall around $3,000, dropping from above $30,300 to below $27,400. The same was the case on July 12 when the index hit 64. This marked the top of the rally and the BTC price would go from $31,000 to below $26,000.

Market optimism is at an all-time high, with investor inflows surpassing $1 billion this year.  Bitcoin [BTC] began the trading week in Asia above $37,000 and ether [ETH] above $2,000, with prices little changed from an exchange-traded fund rally that closed last week, helping narrow the discount on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to levels not seen since July 2021.  Data from YCharts shows the trust's discount to its net asset value is 10.35%. The discount has been shrinking from a record of almost 50% during the depths of the FTX-induced crypto winter in December last year.  Last week, CoinDesk reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated discussions with Grayscale Investments about converting the trust to a spot bitcoin ETF, which, if successful, would provide significant market momentum and liquidity.  Grayscale Investments and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.  Bitcoin fund holdings have reached an all-time high, driven by investor enthusiasm over the anticipated approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S., with total inflows exceeding $1 billion this year, CoinDesk recently reported.  Market sentiment has also been lifted by last week's announcement that fund-management giant BlackRock is planning to issue an ether-based ETF. News of the announcement pushed ETH to a seven-month high, outperforming bitcoin.  In a recent interview with CoinDesk TV, Diffuse Funds CEO Kenny Estes said BlackRock's decision to apply for an ether ETF shows the financial giant is highly confident the bitcoin ETF will be approved.  ""I think it will get approved, and the biggest reason for that is because BlackRock put in the application,"" he said. ""The fact that they're putting in an Ethereum application, to me, sounds like it's a predetermined outcome that it will be approved.""  Meanwhile, trading activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) is also at a six-month high as traders cycle out of altcoins and into ether in anticipation of any ETF approval, according to research from WOO Network shared with CoinDesk.  “[Recent] extreme market volatility showed Arbitrum is still the lead performer in the L2 race, capturing six times the 24-hour trading volume of Optimism, and 25 times that of Base,"" Ben Yorke, WOO Ecosystem VP said in a note shared with CoinDesk, referring to layer-2 blockchains. ""That said, what’s clear is that Ethereum is still ultimately the end boss, overseeing more than twice the volume of all Layer 2 scaling solutions combined – driven in part by the volatility surrounding Blackrock’s apparent filing for an ETH ETF.”  Crypto traders will likely have their eye on Core Consumer Price Index data and U.S. retail sales data, scheduled to be released later this week, along with speeches by New York Fed President John Williams, which should give clues into where interest rates are going.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | WOO,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | WOO,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/13/grayscale-discount-continues-to-narrow-as-spot-bitcoin-ether-etf-euphoria-works-through-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43d8f72892d983fb008fb12eb784014700e84c69-1088x612.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20127170,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560343,1699865116,"Arthur Hayes Unveils His Playbook For Bitcoin, Crypto And Big Tech","In his latest essay, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, has laid out his investment playbook in the current global economic landscape, focusing on the potential of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, big tech, and traditional financial markets. Dumb Trades Hayes begins with a blunt critique of traditional investment strategies, particularly the purchase of long-term bonds in the current economic climate. He explicitly states, “The dumbest thing one can do is purchase long-term bonds with a buy-and-hold mentality.” Hayes explains this viewpoint by highlighting the risks associated with these bonds, especially when liquidity conditions shift, saying, “You will experience a market-to-market gain today, but…the market will start to discount the impact of further Reverse Repo [RRP] balance decreases and long-end bond yields will creep higher, which means prices fall.” Related Reading: The Big Question: Will Bitcoin Hit $100,000 By 2024? Spotlight On Potential Drivers Moving on to smarter investment approaches, Hayes acknowledges leveraging short-term debt, as exemplified by Stan Druckenmiller. Hayes notes that Stan Druckenmiller went mega-long 2-year treasuries. He remarked, “Great trade, brah! Not everyone has the stomach for the best expressions of this trade (hint: it’s crypto). Therefore, if all you can trade are manipulated TradFi assets like government bonds and stocks, then this isn’t a bad option.” Hayes also argues that a trade “that’s a bit better than the medium-smart trade (but still not the smartest) is to go long on big tech.” Hayes focuses on AI-related companies. He identifies AI as a pivotal future technology, arguing, “Everyone knows that everyone knows that AI is the future. This means anything AI-related will pump, because everyone is buying it too. Tech stocks are long-duration assets and will benefit from cash being trash once more.” Smart Trades: Bitcoin And Crypto However, the smartest trade is to go long crypto, which has significantly outperformed other assets relative to the increase in central bank balance sheets. Hayes presented the chart below, comparing the performance of Bitcoin, Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, and Gold against the Fed’s balance sheet since March 2020, highlighting Bitcoin’s exceptional growth. Hayes identifies Bitcoin as the primary investment target, describing it as “money and only money.” Following Bitcoin, he points to Ether as the commodity powering the Ethereum network. “Ether is the commodity that powers the Ethereum network, which is the best internet computer.” He categorizes other cryptocurrencies, stating, “Bitcoin and Ether are crypto’s reserve assets. Everything else is a shitcoin.” He further elaborates on alternative layer-one blockchains like Solana, calling them “all overhyped, me-too, pieces of shit that won’t overtake Ethereum in terms of active developers, dApp activity, or Total Value Locked.” Related Reading: When Is the Next BTC Halving Date? Bitcoin Halving Guide Hayes also discusses decentralized applications (dApps) and their tokens. He finds this sector exciting for its high-return potential, though he acknowledges the risks: “Finally, all manner of dApps and their respective tokens will pump. This is the most fun, because down here is where you get the 10,000x returns. Of course, you’re also more likely to get rugged, but where there is no risk there is no return. I love shitcoins, so don’t ever call me a maxi!” Geo-Economic Factors Regarding his investment strategy in the context of current economic fluctuations, Hayes explains his focus on the net of RRP minus Treasury General Account (TGA) to gauge market liquidity, which informs his decisions on T-bill sales and Bitcoin purchases. He emphasizes the importance of adaptability, stating, “I will stay nimble and flexible. The best-laid plans of mice and men have a tendency to falter.” Hayes also delves into geopolitical considerations, specifically the potential impact of the Hamas v. Israel conflict on oil prices and monetary policy. He notes Bitcoin’s resilience in such scenarios: “Bitcoin has proven to outperform bonds during times of war. The long-term US Treasury bond ETF has fallen 12% vs. Bitcoin pumping 52% since the onset of the Ukraine / Russia war.” While he concedes that Bitcoin could fall in an initial move when Iran is drawn into the Hamas v. Israel war, it would be a “buy the dip” situation according to Hayes. In a candid conclusion, Hayes comments on the historical context of geopolitical conflicts, expressing skepticism about the prospects for global peace: “Of course, if those in charge of Pax Americana committed themselves to peace and global harmony… nah, I’m not even going to finish that thought. These mofos have been practicing war since 1776, with no signs of letting up.” According to Hayes, however, all roads lead to Bitcoin: “[It] will reassert itself as a real-time scorecard on the health of the war-time fiat financial system.” At press time, BTC traded at $37,030.

42419109,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDqZR,1699864342,"The Crypto Market Rally Looks Overdone, JPMorgan Says","Excitement about the potential approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETF) has fueled a strong rally in digital assets over the past month, but the move higher seems overdone, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report last week.  Bullish sentiment has been buoyed by two main arguments, the bank said.  “A spot bitcoin ETF approval would help crypto markets to attract fresh/new capital as the newly-approved ETFs see inflows,” and the “approval would cement a win for the crypto industry and a setback for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) thus making it more likely that going forward the SEC approach towards the crypto industry will soften,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  The bank says it is skeptical of both arguments. Instead of new capital entering the crypto sector, it is more likely that existing capital will move from current bitcoin products such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), bitcoin futures ETFs and listed mining companies, into the newly approved spot ETFS.  JPMorgan notes that such ETFs already exist in Canada and Europe and have gained “little interest from investors since their inception.”  While the Ripple and Grayscale court rulings represent legal defeats for the SEC, “it is far from clear that the regulatory tightening of the crypto industry will lessen significantly going forward given how unregulated this industry is,” the report said.  “U.S. crypto industry regulations are still pending and we do not believe U.S. lawmakers would shift their stance because of the above two legal cases especially with the memories from the FTX fraud still fresh,” the analysts wrote.
