As for altcoins, the less said, the better.  After hitting a new 16-month low earlier in the day, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $29,100, up slightly over the past 24 hours. That was little comfort for investors who have watched it plunge with other digital assets the past few days, swept up with investor fears following the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin against its 1:1 dollar peg. Bitcoin was already reeling from wider concerns about high inflation and geopolitical turmoil.  Still, other cryptocurrencies fared far worse, a sign of the risk-off environment that has investors veering away quickly from any asset with a whiff of risk. Ether was trading at about $1,960, off about 5% after dipping under $1,800 earlier in the day, the first time since last July it had sunk below that level. In a sea of major crypto red, SOL, CRO, ADA and MATIC were each down roughly 10% at one point. SAND and ATOM were off 14.5% and 9%, respectively.  Meanwhile, Terra blockchain's LUNA token plunged below 2 cents on Thursday, prompting validators to briefly halted the network to implement a patch that would prevent new actors from staking on it. Just a month ago, LUNA had reached a high of $120. UST was recently trading at about 33 cents, down about 54%.  Equity markets did better, rallying late to finish slightly down from where they started the day. Still, rising prices loomed large as a report Thursday found that mortgage rates had climbed to 5.3%, their highest rate since 2009.  In an interview on Thursday with the public radio business show ""Marketplace,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that he couldn't guarantee a soft economic landing as the Fed increases interest rates to tame inflation. ""Whether we can execute a soft landing or not, it may actually depend on factors that we don’t control,"" Powell said.  ""The higher-than-expected inflation figures in the U.S. have prompted investors to move towards selling risky assets, impacting cryptocurrencies in the process as well,"" Daniel Takieddine, CEO of Middle East and North Africa region of brokerage BDSwiss, wrote in an email. ""The move towards a rapid rise in interest rates could keep cryptocurrencies on a sliding trend for a longer period of time as investors move to safer assets.""  He added: ""This bearish trend is further exacerbated by the recent crash of the TerraUSD, which lost its peg to the USD by a large margin. Its fall in value has eroded investors' confidence in the crypto markets and in the stablecoin concept in particular.""  Markets  S&P 500: 3,930 -0.1%  DJIA: 31,730 -0.3%  Nasdaq: 11,370 -.06%  Gold: $1,820 -1.8%  Insights  Terra's implosion threatens crypto lending protocols  Crypto lending, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), was built in the rubble of the COVID-19-induced crash of March 2020. The prevailing logic behind crypto lending is to provide a smoother off ramp than rapid-fire selling, which depresses prices.  But as the collapse of Terra’s LUNA and UST tokens has sent shock waves throughout the industry, accelerating the decline of the price of bitcoin, knocking tether off its peg and reiterating concerns from institutions and regulators about the viability of the asset class, crypto lending appears to be its next victim.  Data now suggests that there’s a cavalcade of people looking for an exit.  The total locked-in value for DeFi is at $150 billion, down from just under $240 billion at the start of the year and from $230 billion a month ago, according to Glassnode data.  Data would suggest that many traders are moving their crypto out of DeFi protocols and into stablecoins like USDC with plans to redeem them (stablecoins like USDC and USDT can be redeemed for U.S. dollars upon request).  The supply of USDC, used by institutions and U.S.-based traders because of its regulatory compliance, is now just below $48.5 billion, down from $53 billion at the beginning of March. A similar trend is being seen with Glassnode’s data on exchange net positions. Since mid-April, it has flipped to red, now accelerating with Glassnode reporting daily outflows in the $2 billion range.  At the same time, lending protocols like Compound are reporting large declines in stablecoin supply. Compound, for instance, reports an 11% decline in USDC supply. All the while, gas trackers show that in the last week gas fees from USDC are up 175%, while gas usage at lending protocol Aave is up 705% over the past week.  Lending protocol prices aren’t taking well to this dash for the exit. Across the board, the tokens of major lending protocols are down with aave falling 53% over the past week. Celsius has dropped 55.6% over the past week and compound has fallen 49% during that time.  Despite less USDC in circulation, there doesn’t seem to be a particular increase in demand for it. Given the coming bear market, trading tempo will likely decrease and planned investment into crypto infrastructure might slow. The case and point for this is the yield offered by Alameda Research’s syndicated loans powered by the Maple Finance protocol.  Alameda’s most recent USDC-denominated loan, which launched last week just as the Luna crisis emerged, is now offering only a 6.5% yield. When the project began last November, 8.5% was the available yield. Although there is less USDC available, Alameda is anticipating a slowdown and doesn’t have the same need for it.  The good news from this crisis is that many parts of the infrastructure surrounding crypto are continuing to hold. USDC and Binance’s BUSD, are still at $, and redemptions – even from tether which was briefly knocked off its peg – are being processed on request.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holding Support Above $27K, Resistance at $35K-$40K  Bitcoin appears to be oversold on the charts, which typically precedes a short-term upswing in price.  The cryptocurrency declined toward $25,400 Thursday afternoon before quickly recovering back above the $27,000 support level.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is the most oversold since January, which preceded a 30% relief rally. This time, however, negative long-term momentum could cap upside moves around the $35,000 resistance level.  Further, BTC registered a countertrend reversal signal on the daily chart, according to DeMARK indicators. That means selling pressure could wane over the next few days as buyers return from the sidelines. Another daily close above $30,000 would confirm the countertrend signal, although there is a low chance of significant upside from here.

It is trading for $0.102 and stands in the 10th position of all cryptocurrencies rankings according to CoinMarketCap. On 8th May 2021, it attained its all-time high price of $0.7376 due to comments made by the world&apos;s richest man Elon Musk. It&apos;s been over a year, and this psychological resistance persists. Now the question is, how do we proceed from here? We shall consider some of the factors that can improve the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) in the coming years.

42395416,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASwswE,1652395727,Core Scientific Cites Crypto Market Turmoil in Lowering Its Growth Outlook,"Core Scientific (CORZ), which currently has the highest hashrate among publicly traded bitcoin miners, just lowered its 2022 outlook, saying it would take the more conservative approach to growing the company because of market volatility.  In announcing disappointing first-quarter earnings earlier on Thursday, the miner lowered its 2022 hashrate guidance to 30-32 exahash per second (EH/s) from its previous outlook of 40-42 EH/s, and now sees total power of about 1 gigawatt versus previous guidance of between 1.2 and 1.3 gigawatt (GW).  “We would characterize it as an appropriately conservative approach to growth, making sure we have the money to do what we say we're going to do,” CEO Mike Levitt said during the earnings conference call. “We remained very comfortable with our ability to internally fund our growth to approximately one gigawatt,” he added.  Levitt noted that his company could still decide to expand beyond the one gigawatt of power capacity, but would only do so if capital is available on “compelling terms,” either from the markets or through pre-funding by its customers.  “Despite a very challenging environment, we are sufficiently capitalized to achieve our 2022 objectives, and we have the ability to exceed those objectives, should it make sense to do so,” Levitt said during the call.  Levitt also said the company is not interested in issuing equity at these market conditions and may sell some of its mined coins this year. “We will continue to do everything in our power to maintain a stable strong financial position and continue to invest in our growth,” Levitt said. “We currently hold over 10,000 self-mined bitcoins [BTC]. That said, we have sold digital assets this year and we expect that will continue to be the case,” he added.  The comments align with peers such as Riot Blockchain (RIOT), which has already started selling its mined bitcoins, and Marathon (MARA), which recently said it might start to do so.  Investors reacted favorably to Core Scientific's new approach. Core’s share price rose in after-hours trading, even after the company cut its 2022 guidance and missed first quarter estimates for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. However, both metrics were up multiple-fold year over year.  M&A opportunities  During the conference call, Core’s Levitt said customer demand continues to be strong for its colocation services, and that the miner is still engaged in a number of conversations. However, he added that customers must bring in capital to fund their orders or Core would not include them as customers.  The lack of capital has become a bigger issue for the miner, more so now than before, given the recent crash in crypto currency market, and investors becoming more risk averse. Crypto-linked stocks are tumbling along with broader equity markets as investors hit the sell button on almost all asset classes amid surging inflation, recessionary fears and geopolitical unrest.  “The capital markets are challenging for many in our industry,” Levitt said. “There are a number of folks that have commitments that were dependent upon their being able to raise additional capital, and they're finding it challenging to raise that capital,” he added.  These market dynamics, though, have helped create some possible M&A opportunities because of the company’s size and funding, Levitt said. “We believe we're well positioned for continued growth and to take advantage of new opportunities that may come our way in this type of environment,” he said, adding: “We're starting already to have to be approached, frankly, with opportunities,” although “there's nothing to talk about today.”  Read more: Marathon’s Thiel Says Company Not for Sale, as M&A Chatter Picks Up Among Crypto Miners",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/12/core-scientific-cites-crypto-market-turmoil-in-lowering-its-growth-outlook,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45b2cf9bcd59831153a5222aba4664c7e2d083d6-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Even while NFTs themselves have no harmful environmental impact, the technologies used to make them have a significant effect on our climate. NFTs are manufactured in a very energy-intensive manner. The majority of NFTs are created using the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which requires a lot of power. Any operation that uses a lot of energy, crypto or otherwise, contributes to climate change by releasing carbon dioxide into the environment. There are, however, more ecologically friendly methods of minting NFTs, namely methods that use proof of stake. How are NFTs harming mother nature? NFTs inherently have little to no environmental impact, but the minting process does have substantial ecological consequences. Let&apos;s look at how proof-of-work NFTs are created and why they need so much energy. NFT is listed on a digital marketplace: Typically, before an NFT is issued, it is posted on an NFT marketplace. Listing an NFT does not need a lot of energy, but the platform it is being listed on does have a significant impact on the amount of energy required for the mining process. In the short term, choosing an NFT marketplace like OpenSea, which hosts the Ethereum network based on proof of work, implies the minting process will consume more energy than usual.

42395409,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASwstH,1652393456,Kevin Zhou on UST's Roller-Coaster Ride and Where It Goes From Here,"For months now, Kevin Zhou, the co-founder of hedge fund Galois Capital and former head of trading at digital asset exchange Kraken, has been sounding the alarm on the LUNA and UST issuer, Terraform Labs.  Just today, Terra briefly halted its blockchain, citing inflation for LUNA and the potential for government attacks after the price of the token plunged to less than 2 cents.  And in the span of 72 hours, the Terra ecosystem, which includes the LUNA token and UST, among other algorithmic stablecoins, has been in free fall. LUNA’s price has fallen by more than $80, while UST, the stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, dropped to 37 cents earlier Thursday.  Despite his concerns, Zhou has been taken aback by how quickly things have turned south for the Terra ecosystem. “Even if it happened in slow motion, even if it was something like a bank walk, it was more about this thing not being solvent,” Zhou said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”  But in the end it was inevitable, according to Zhou, who added that the “mechanism was flawed, and it didn’t play out as expected.”  In the aftermath, Terra has extended a proposal to its users that would burn 1 billion UST (more than $690 million) to save the stablecoin using the community’s UST. It said it would also increase the circulation of LUNA, which supports UST, to 100 million tokens, in an effort to push UST back to $1.  Financial firms including BlackRock (BLK) and Gemini are quashing conspiracy theories that the firms were involved in the collapse of UST. On social media, the companies said they don’t trade UST.  Zhou underscored the sentiment, and pointed to problems with compliance as to why the financial firms would not be able to touch these kinds of assets.  While the markets have been in flux due to UST’s collapse, millions of hundreds of people have been affected. “A lot of people have lost their homes, tons of money and maybe their life savings,” Zhou said.  Sentiment around the Terra ecosystem will further worsen, Zhou added, in part because it's “not even just the mechanical death spiral, but also a psychological one.”  Looking back, the red flags were there, when founder Do Kwon purchased massive amounts of bitcoin (BTC) and began taking in millions of dollars from investors. Though it may not have been a bad move, it did reveal a more important point. “It signaled to the market that they no longer believed in their own narrative,” Zhou said.  Now, as Terra looks to restore UST’s $1 peg, Zhou said it's possible it may be able to do so, but not guaranteed. He noted that Terra should have revalued its currency earlier on and allowed users to take a massive haircut, which may have relieved some of the selling pressure on LUNA.  But at this point, “we’re just undergoing hyperinflation of LUNA in order to support the exit of UST, and now we have to just let it happen.”  Terra’s proposal is good, but not good enough, according to Zhou. “At the end of the day, all of this bad debt has to get flushed out and we’re still in the early innings of that,” Zhou said.",NEGATIVE,BTC | LUNA,BTC | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/12/kevin-zhou-on-usts-roller-coaster-ride-and-where-it-goes-from-here,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b9f0e71c2ec8da41e8e4d1b3b2a193099757f12-2516x1398.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Man Arrested, Charged With Fraud for Alleged Role in $59M Crypto Pyramid Scheme","A New York man was arrested and charged with fraud on Thursday morning for his role in an alleged crypto investing scheme that the Federal Bureau of Investigation says duped investors out of $59 million.  Eddy Alexandre, 50, of Valley Stream, N.Y., is the CEO of EminiFX, a cryptocurrency and forex trading platform. Authorities say that beginning last September Alexandre founded and ran EminiFX and convinced “hundreds of individual investors” to invest with him.  According to Alexandre's social media profiles, he is a cybersecurity engineer with nearly 30 years of experience, most recently as a senior IT professional at WarnerMedia (WBD).  According to the criminal complaint, Alexandre told investors he could double their money within five months, promising 5% weekly returns he allegedly generated through secretive robo-advising technology.  Authorities claim Alexandre didn't invest the “vast majority of investor funds entrusted to him [and] sustained losses on the limited portion of funds that he did invest.”  He is accused of spending about $15 million of the investor funds on personal expenses, putting money in his personal bank accounts and spending about $170,000 on luxury vehicle purchases.  Investors were led to believe their accounts were growing between 5% and 10% each week with doctored account statements provided on EminiFX’s website, according to the FBI. Authorities say Alexandre told nervous investors that his company had “experienced traders” making investments on behalf of the customers, but never told them exactly what they were investing in.  Alexandre also spent customer funds on business expenses, including renting an office, holding a gala and hiring lawyers, according to the complaint. He allegedly used the office and other promotional events to find new investors, along with a multilevel marketing-style recruitment model.

42411465,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO56j,1652389033,"Luna's Collapse Shows DeFi's Dire Need for Technical, Regulatory Controls","A ""Black Swan"" event is unpredictable beyond what is normally expected of a situation, is obvious in hindsight and has potentially severe consequences. Examples include the subprime crisis and subsequent meltdown of the banking sector in 2008 and the market capitulation following the start of the global pandemic.  In the financial markets, or in any industry for that matter, Black Swan events are mostly known as negative. Still, history shows that these events are also a pivotal point of positive systemic change. I believe that the same process will apply to this event.  Ahmed Ismail is president and CEO of Fluid, a DeFi liquidity aggregator, and co-founder of HAYVN, a regulated over-the-counter desk in the Middle East.  The downfall of UST as an algorithmic stablecoin is a Black Swan event and should never have happened. It was a project worth over $18 billion – practically too big to fail. Stronger regulatory controls overseeing the project’s automated trading system could have mitigated the situation a long time ago.  See also: Nassim Taleb, Ex-Bitcoin Admirer, Publishes Paper Trashing It  Terra’s meltdown spread to bitcoin, causing its price to drop by $10,000 in a matter of hours. It has also caused widespread damage to our peers in the crypto industry, notably exchanges and small and large investors.  If automated decentralized finance (DeFi) trading systems are to grow to this size, there is a need for better regulation and stakeholder safeguards.  Risks associated with algorithmic stablecoins  What has come to the fore this week are the risks associated with algorithmic stablecoins. The key message here is that computer code cannot replace asset-backed collateral.  An algorithmic stablecoin isn’t backed by assets; instead, it’s stabilized by computer code through an algorithm or algorithms designed to hold its peg. Many “algos” have failed before UST, but this historic collapse now proves that algorithmic stablecoins have loopholes in their architecture.  Unfortunately, this chink in the Terra network’s design has managed to bring what was a multibillion-dollar project close to zero within days. It also caused systemic risk across DeFi and the broader crypto industry.  The network’s builders, primarily Terraform Labs, tried to defend the UST/USD peg position by selling large amounts of BTC held in reserve.  A silver lining: It seems as though asset-backed stablecoins such as USDT, USDC and BUSD have weathered the storm and investor sentiment remains intact, although they haven’t been untouched. USDT, for instance, traded nearly 5% away from its USD peg on Thursday, showing how extreme volatility affects the price of stablecoins that are meant to be 100% asset backed.  This event has highlighted key lessons to be internalized by the DeFi industry: Algorithmic stablecoins do not work, or at least need much more research and development. Further, regulatory and technological controls must be enacted before another algo is allowed to get so big.  Crypto needs to be able to handle extreme volatility  This isn’t the first Black Swan event, nor will it be the last. They will happen again in the future. The big question, though, is why was there systemic fallout that affected other assets in the market and how can that be mitigated?  See also: Unleashing Liquidity in DeFi Trading | Opinion  The answer boils down to liquidity, volatility and how markets react in the face of Black Swans. Crypto markets are illiquid and thinly traded. Liquidity is siloed, and crypto markets are extremely inefficient. They become especially vulnerable, and even the most stable cryptos such as BTC and ETH are fragile. All assets will falter when liquidity cannot flow.  So, crypto markets need liquidity aggregators. These systems could help investors manage the turbulent waters caused by Black Swan events – when volatile conditions occur, market participants need access to liquidity quickly and at the best possible price to maintain equilibriums.  As for regulatory controls, I am certain lawmakers will look at the implosion of one of the largest crypto assets ever and find ways to tame the industry.  That’s just our industry growing and learning.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Ahmed Ismail,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/12/lunas-collapse-shows-defis-dire-need-for-technical-regulatory-controls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00dde42fbd18f8eca3614cdb2a7996ec30b385f9-2400x1590.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42374433,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZVdF,1652388554,Derivatives' Old Guard Fights FTX Chief Over Plan to Cut Out Middlemen,"FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried spent hours before U.S. lawmakers Thursday defending his effort to allow customers to directly clear margin-backed crypto derivatives. The existing derivatives industry and its allies argued he’s seeking a power that could stretch well beyond crypto.  Several members of the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture – which oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – expressed wide distrust of the cryptocurrency industry during a hearing, even raising the recent mayhem with terraUSD (UST). Bankman-Fried took heat from both Democrats and Republicans on the panel, with Chairman David Scott (D-Ga.) saying the FTX.US proposal to the CFTC “could be a serious threat.”  But representatives of the derivatives markets made it clear FTX is directly threatening their territory, arguing that cutting out intermediaries for derivatives trades wasn’t just an idea that was going to stop with digital assets. Terry Duffy, the chief executive officer of CME Group, the world’s leading derivatives exchange, aimed much of his criticism at the possibility FTX would expand beyond crypto, because its application would allow it to do so.  ""The risk of this going into other markets is extremely detrimental,"" Duffy told lawmakers. ""This is a proposal that's fraught with danger.""  Bankman-Fried repeated several times that his company has no wider intent, for now.  ""We do not have any plans to launch non-digital asset contracts any time soon through this model,"" he said. ""I'm not lying to you,” Bankman-Fried insisted at one point. “I really do mean this.""  He suggested FTX would be willing to accept some additional formal limits, though he didn’t agree to permanently locking his firm into only digital assets. He also pointed out that FTX is already approved by multiple overseas regulators to clear crypto transactions in methods similar to what they’re asking permission for in the U.S.  “The model that we'd be proposing for U.S. FTX derivatives is a more conservative model than what we operate overseas, and I think that it has provided a large number of helpful risk features and safeguards on the product,” Bankman-Fried said.  One lawmaker, Rep. Sean Maloney, (D-N.Y.), told Bankman-Fried that he’d come up with “a cool idea.”  “You sure got everybody stirred up,” he said of the derivatives industry representatives opposing the application. “They hate this idea, understandably, because of what it does to their business,” he said, adding that “it’s a hell of a disruption – let’s face it.”  On May 25, the CFTC, which is still weighing the company’s application, will host a roundtable to openly discuss the concept pushed by FTX, inviting industry representatives, academics and public-interest groups.

Revenue was up 255% from the same quarter last year, mainly because of increases in digital asset mining and hosting revenue. That was partly offset by a decrease in equipment sales, the company said in a statement.  Core Scientific cut its 2022 hashrate outlook to 30-32 exahashes per second from its previous outlook of 40-42 EH/s, and now sees total power of about 1 gigawatt, compared with its previous forecast of between 1.2 and 1.3 gigawatts.  “We have worked to de-risk our 2022 growth to between 30 and 32 exahash, fully supported by our existing capital structure,” CEO Mike Levitt said in the statement. “We preserve the flexibility to expand beyond our plan, should capital market conditions improve.”  The miner also reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $93 million, which was up 644% from the first quarter of last year, but below analysts' average estimate of $111 million.  The miner said its mining segment had a gross margin of 48% in the first quarter, compared with 83% in the prior-year period. The decrease was driven by higher miner depreciation, higher power costs and lower average price per bitcoin mined.  Shares of the miner were up 1.3% in after-hours trading on Thursday, while bitcoin traded down roughly 2% over the last 24 hours to around $28,000. The stock has dropped 65% this year, roughly on pace with peers Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT).

42395417,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASwsyC,1652386717,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stabilizes as Altcoins Underperform; Expect More Volatility,"Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest crypto by market capitalization, experienced a sharp decline toward $25,402 on Thursday. The cryptocurrency stabilized later in the New York trading day, but is still down by 20% over the past week.  Wild price swings have been the norm over the past few months, which left many alternative cryptos (altcoins) vulnerable to extreme selling pressure. In down markets, alts decline by more than bitcoin because of their higher risk profile.  For example, Solana's SOL token is down by 46% over the past week, compared with a 30% decline in ether (ETH) over the same period. And BTC declined less than several alts over the past 24 hours, indicating a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Meanwhile, on Thursday, the price of the Terra blockchain's token LUNA plunged below 2 cents. The sharp price move made the network vulnerable to governance attacks, which triggered a brief shutdown of the blockchain, which meant no transactions with the algorithmic stablecoin UST, LUNA or Terra's other cryptocurrencies could be processed.  ""The more considerable risk is in another bout of market panic, caused by the macro environment and exacerbated by LUNA-driven risk that could lead to BTC and ETH losing support,"" Sean Farrell, vice president of digital asset strategy at FundStrat, wrote in an email.  Farrell stated that FundStrat is not ready to call a bottom in bitcoin because of macroeconomic risks and concerns about LUNA and UST.  ""There could be significant negative repercussions for cryptocurrencies and digital finance if investors lose confidence in stablecoins,"" Fitch Ratings wrote in a Thursday report. The firm expects increased calls for stablecoin regulation going forward, especially as many regulated financial entities have increased their exposure to digital assets (including decentralized finance) in recent months.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $28,635, −2.34%    ●Ether (ETH): $1,945, −7.89%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $3,930, −0.12%    ●Gold: $1,824 per troy ounce, −1.57%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.82%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin dominance rises  The chart below shows a short-term breakout in the bitcoin dominance ratio, or BTC's market cap relative to the total crypto market cap. The ratio typically rises in down markets as BTC experiences less selling pressure relative to smaller tokens.  A reading around 50% in the dominance ratio could signal a prolonged risk-off environment. For now, market conditions are still neutral as alts have gone in and out of favor over the past year. That suggests traders are still finding short-term opportunities to add risk, albeit with less conviction compared with last year's bull market.  Ether was down by as much as 11% over the past 24 hours, compared with a max 4% drop in BTC over the same period. The underperformance of ETH relative to BTC typically signals risk-off conditions.  The chart below shows a downtick in the ETH/BTC price ratio below its 40-week moving average. The ratio could remain under pressure, especially if cryptos and equities fail to stabilize over the next few weeks.  Some analysts expect downside risk based on historical trading data.  For example, after a rapid three-day decline of more than 12.5%, BTC tends to exhibit short-term weakness, according to Nautilus Capital. The firm highlighted nine similar downswings in BTC's price over the past five years – a small sample size, although enough to show volatile conditions are expected to persist.  Altcoin roundup  Terra restarts blockchain after brief shutdown: The Terra blockchain restarted around 1:45 p.m. ET Thursday after validators briefly halted the network to implement a patch that would prevent new actors from staking on it after the luna token (LUNA) fell to below 2 cents earlier in the day. Terraform said the price of LUNA fell too low to ""prevent governance attacks,"" citing LUNA inflation as one factor. Read more here.  Terra proposes token burn: Terra believes decreasing the amount of UST in circulation while increasing the amount of available LUNA is the easiest way to return the UST to its dollar peg. “The primary obstacle is expelling the bad debt from UST circulation at a clip fast enough for the system to restore the health of on-chain spreads,” said Terra in a tweet.

Anchor could cut yields: The contributors of Terra-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Anchor have proposed cutting terraUSD (UST) rates to an average of 4% from the current 19.5% as the broader Terra ecosystem seeks measures to protect UST’s peg with the U.S. dollar. “Decrease minimum interest rates to 3.5%, and maximum deposit rates to 5.5%, with a targeted interest rate of 4%,” the ongoing proposal describes.

This was before DeFi, before NFTs, and before even Larry David, Tom Brady and Matt Damon began hawking crypto.  “I just don’t give a f**k,” she told me back then, explaining that in any given conversation, the best thing we can do is “take the proverbial mask off” and act like our true and authentic selves.

True, it’s almost a cliche for crypto OGs to say “I’ve seen bear markets before, and it’s always the same,” but you get extra credit for calling the shot early. In the spring of 2018, Demirors sensed that the crypto space had gone through an “orgy of unfettered capitalism” and told me that she was “excited about a period of depressed prices where we can focus on really building.” She nailed it. This is precisely what happened.  In these past four years – seven since she joined the space, helping to launch Digital Currency Group [parent company of CoinDesk] – Demirors has been building, investing, inspiring and tirelessly memeing. What’s her role in the space now, exactly? “That’s a really good question,” Demirors tells me over Zoom from her home in New Hampshire. Officially she’s the chief strategy officer of CoinShares, an investment firm. Unofficially? “I think my role has always been sort of the same,” she said. “I like connecting the dots. Whether that's connecting ideas, people or capital together, that's what I like to do.”  And in our wide-ranging (and cheerfully profane) conversation, Demirors somehow connects the dots between investing frameworks, crypto twitter, how it’s “really hard to get punched in the face every single day,” why style can be empowering, the highest ROI activity in crypto, why haters can “go eat a d**k,” and why she’s toying with the idea of starting her own cult …with her as the high priestess.  Welcome to Cult Meltem.  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Meltem, it has been four years since! And the space has changed so much. What has surprised you most about how it has evolved?  Meltem Demirors: Just the speed at which the narrative around Bitcoin and crypto shifted. It happened so suddenly and so quickly and from so many places that, historically, have been so anti-Bitcoin.  And the pace at which crypto has become a part of the cultural zeitgeist and popular lexicon. Seven years ago, when I started in this industry, it was impossible to find people who knew what Bitcoin was. Now I can't go anywhere without people telling me about Bitcoin or NFTs or some token they're into.  I’m imagining some crypto bro mansplaining Bitcoin to you …  Oh, this happened! At a dinner, I sat next to this younger person, and over three hours he explained how Bitcoin works to me. I'm like, “Tell me more. I'm fascinated. I've never heard of Bitcoin. Tell me everything.” It was fun.  [Both laugh.]  You’re “very online,” and you’re also a big picture thinker. How do you structure your day to preserve your sanity and to not get swallowed up by Crypto Twitter? What are your productivity hacks?  I don't manage it. It's just chaotic, and I happen to operate well in chaotic environments. So that's good. A big thing that helps is I just let my curiosity sort of guide me to where I need to go.  Spending more time in New Hampshire has certainly helped me stay focused, because there are no distractions. It's just me in the woods. My family is nearby, and I have some friends nearby, but it’s very much going to bed at 10:30 and waking up at 5:30. Finding space and time to think has been really important for me.  And I do a lot of experimenting. Interacting with online communities, joining DAOs, and s**tposting on the internet is actually really informative and really helpful, because it exposes you to new people, new ideas. One of the things I learned early on is: The highest ROI activity in crypto is putting your ideas and your thoughts out into the universe and seeing who and what comes back to you.  Interesting. Can you elaborate?  My best relationships, my best investments, my most productive collaborations have come from interacting with people, from bonding over shared appreciation of something. Whether that’s a sci-fi book, a meme or a thought about the inflationary economics of DeFi tokens. And pursuing that further in a smaller forum, and then that evolves, and then it's all of a sudden, “Hey, I'm starting a company. Do you want to help me with this?” And I'm like, “Yes. Also, I'd like to invest.”  And then most of my friends at this point are crypto people, so my social life is crypto. I go on vacations with crypto people, and so you're just kind of immersed in it. To some people, that sounds like hell. For me, it's fun.  Let’s talk investing. Is there a framework you use for potential investments? Any core investing principles you can share?  Look, I'm a novice investor. I've been doing it for about five or six years now, which in the world of venture investing in particular, it's very difficult to tell if you're good or lucky, right? It takes much longer than five years. So, it’s to-be-determined if I’m actually a good investor. Step one is admitting you have no idea really if you’re good or bad.  Fair caveat! But with that said, how do you view potential investments?  I do think there are few basic ideas to anchor around. One framework I find really helpful is thinking about things in terms of categories. I hadn’t figured out how to articulate this until I read a blog post from Galois Capital, which categorized projects into a two-by-two matrix.  My best relationships, my best investments, my most productive collaborations have come from interacting with people.  On one axis is “Utopianism,” and that can be Very Utopian, like a pie-in-the-sky idea, or not at all Utopian, and just sort of super practical.  As in, “We’re going to reduce a customer’s call-time by 14%?”  Exactly. And on the other axis is Grift. It could be High Grift or Low Grift. So you have four quadrants.  Love it. What’s an example?  So in quadrant one, you have infrastructure companies. They're very mundane. Not sexy. They’re like, “We are going to solve a very specific, very practical problem."" Doing your taxes, that is not inspiring or utopian, but it's very practical. It’s also not high grift. It’s like, “Hey, we're gonna help you do your taxes. You pay us a fee."" That's a very infrastructure-y business. Or take Coinbase. That’s a very practical business. Low grift, right? So that's Quadrant One. That's what people tend to call picks-and-shovels core infrastructure.  Category two is low grift but high utopianism. These are sort of your moonshot, super aspirational ideas, but they're not scammy.  Then there's quadrant three, which is high utopianism but also high grift. Like dog coins, right? Dog coins are like, ""Somebody buy my f**king bags, please, so I can exit.”  And a lot of crypto is very high grift, with quick unlock schedules, no founder vesting, and massive allocation goes to investors and insiders, all optimized around short-term value extraction.  Like many of the 10,000-piece NFT drops, right?  Yeah. The 10,000 pixelated animal PFP drop is high grift, low utopianism. There's nothing innovative about it. And then there’s the interesting category High Utopianism but also Very High Grift, all of these moonshot protocols that are like, ""We're going to tokenize human knowledge.”  When you’re assessing a project, what do you look for in a founder?  My biggest thing is, no assholes. I think a tiger doesn't change its stripes. So if someone has a reputation for being rude or dismissive or disrespectful or manipulative or dishonest, they could make me a lot of money, but I’m just not interested. It's just going to cause me stress and anxiety.  I like working with people who are honest, who are straightforward, who are transparent, who are good people. I do background checks on people.  Good rule of thumb. What else do you look for?  Just the level of passion that someone feels about what they're doing and the problem they're solving. It's very easy to tell when someone is excited about getting rich or being successful. I think there's so much “hustle porn” out there right now, and there’s this founder culture where everyone's a founder of something, right? I see people walking around and they’re like, “I’m founder and CEO of X,"" and I'm thinking, “Right, but you’re the only person who works there.”  So with true founders I ask, why is this person motivated to solve this problem? What unique insight do they have? Or what's the personal story? And at the end of the day, if you're really excited about what you're doing, it’s just gonna be really hard to get punched in the face every single day.  What do you mean by that exactly, getting punched in the face?  In the crypto investor space, it’s nice when things are on the up, and things are looking good, investors love you, and customers love you. But there’s always the struggle. I've been doing this for seven years. I experience struggle all the time. And people from the outside are like, ""Oh, you look so successful."" I'm like, ""Bitch, my job is getting punched in the face every day in like five different ways.”  I've gotten punched in the face more times than I can count. There’s that meme of a duck, and you look at a duck that’s sitting on a pond. It looks so peaceful. But below the water, its little flippers are just paddling like crazy. I think that's everyone in the space, which is why empathy and kindness and just being a good human goes a long way. Because it’s very difficult to know what people are going through, and it's helpful to give people the benefit of the doubt.  Are you open to sharing some of those struggles, of getting punched in the face?  Yeah. I mean, look, in March of 2020, when bitcoin plummeted to $3,500, my business partners at CoinShares and I got on a call. We’re like, “What do we do? What do we do now?” Luckily, it was okay, and we figured it out. We had issues with regulators trying to shut us down, and it was like, “Is our business over?"" And we figured it out. And in my early days at DCG I definitely got punched in the face a bunch. But I learned a lot from that experience and how to take care of myself and how to look out for my own best interest. So you just learn.  And I've also had personal experiences, right?  Can you share what happened?  I had a stalker at one point, which taught me a lot about privacy and security, and how to choose very carefully what you share and do not share. I've had people in the industry form WhatsApp groups about taking me down or humbling me. All-male groups where they're like, ""This bitch needs to be taken down.""  If you look at my YouTube videos, literally half the comments are like, ""Kill the girl. I hate her. Make her stop talking."" It's so gendered and so misogynistic."" And it's fascinating, because a man could say the same things I'm saying, and they're like, ""Oh my God, he's a genius."" But because I come in a different package, it's like, ""F**k this bitch."" And I'm like, well, that's really fun to deal with. And you learn to deal with it.  I think that's definitely a huge factor in the space, especially in the Bitcoin community, that is deeply problematic.  But I think that's definitely a huge factor in the space, especially in the Bitcoin community, that is deeply problematic. But look, at the end of the day, I’m not going anywhere. Try harder.  On a topic that’s kind of adjacent to this, you wrote a great essay for Des Femmes about style. Can you elaborate on how style is important to you, and why it matters?  Style isn't just what you wear. It's how you interact with the world around you, right? It's that energy you bring. It's your attitude. Like, I'm here. I'm here to have a good time. Yes, we're gonna change the world, but we can also have fun while we're doing it. We can look great while we're doing it.  A lot of people criticize me for my voice because I have a Valley girl voice. It's like, ""Yeah, that's my f**king voice.""  You have a great voice!  I'm gonna keep talking like this. Or sometimes I talk like a Gen Z person. I love saying things like, ""It's lit,"" or, ""That's fire."" I love those turns of phrase. And people are like, ""That's not professional."" And I'm thinking, ""Go f**k yourself. Honestly, go eat a d**k."" Excuse my language.  We don’t f**king care!  Style is about, I think, creating space for other people, and going into the world as your whole self, and being expressive and being unapologetic about it. And I think there are a lot of people in crypto who have great style, whether that's the way they present themselves physically, or whether that's the way they act online. And I think it creates space. It creates more room for all sorts of people because they look at that, and they say, “Oh, if there's room for this person, and if this person is comfortable like this, then maybe there's rooms for me as well.”  And it's incredible because so many women, when I meet them, they're like, ""You doing X makes me feel so much more comfortable. You going out there and feeling comfortable saying this or that, or wearing that, makes room for me to also do things that I want to do but haven't really felt comfortable doing.""  That feels really important.  It's really important for there to be room in this industry for a lot of different types of people. And my approach is very unique to me. Like, I want to be fun. I want to be irreverent. I want to be a little bit cheeky.  Like, we work in magical internet money. So if I dress like a disco ball, let me. But I do think it's really important that this is a welcoming space where people could see a place for themselves. And I think that's really difficult if we all try to conform to the crypto bro look of disheveled T-shirt.  Zooming out a bit, how would you describe your overall world-view?  That's a good question. I think I'm an optimistic nihilist, if that makes sense. In many ways it’s like, ""It was the best of times. It was the worst of times."" I like to use the phrase “clown world.” We live in a clown world where I'm like, ""This is clown ... this is preposterous.""  But at the same time, I'm really f**king optimistic. Look at this community. Over the last 13 years, we have memed a world reserve currency into existence, right? That's an oversimplification, but we have. We did that. And there hundreds of millions of people who contributed to that happening. That's f**king amazing. Like, what a time to live in. Poverty is at its lowest level ever in human history. There are so many things that are really, really amazing that are happening all the time. And there are also so many really f**king terrible things.  Let’s finish with something you’ve joked about on Twitter before – forming your own cult.  I’m going to be speaking about this at Consensus; I’m finally ready to start my own cult.  Excellent! What does Cult Meltem look like?  I mean, look, it's half tongue-in-cheek, it's half serious. I think that in so much of our world today, there is a massive crisis of meaning. The world's largest religion is a religion with no name, which is the spiritual-but-not-religious movement. Over 40% of the U.S. population prescribes to this ""ideology."" And I think one of the reasons why crypto is so popular is because it gives people a sense of community and belonging. It gives them an ideology and sort of a manual on how to live their life. Crypto, and Bitcoin in particular, is quite dogmatic in terms of having a specific set of values and having a certain code of conduct.  For better or worse.  Absolutely. And now we’re actually, full-on building cults through DAOs. We call them decentralized autonomous organizations, really these are communities of belief. And I also think that many corporations and large companies are cults, right? Berkshire Hathaway just had their annual conclave in Omaha, Nebraska, where 55,000 people descend to listen to their prophet, Warren Buffett and his apostle, Charlie Munger, preach from on high.  Right, I’m with you so far …  The connotation that people have when you say cult or religion is generally negative, but I'm using it in the most abstract sense, where really religion has historically been about a set of symbols and about a set of narratives that informs how people construct their sense of reality, their sense of the world around them.  One of the cool things is that crypto is bending the arc of reality. It is bending our perception of what is possible. I think it's inherently optimistic in some ways. It's much more optimistic than the alternative, where if you look at the state of the world, the credibility of institutions of all types is crumbling. And the credibility of these sort of ephemeral online communities is growing very quickly, right? It grows and declines very quickly.  So I do think there's this interesting new sociological trend that's taking place in the crypto space. There are elements of mysticism in it, there are elements of science in it, but it's largely faith and belief-driven. It centers around these figures in our community. There's a lot of cult worship and hero worship of these figures in our industry.  Tons of cult worship in the space!  That's where it started. But now I'm kind of serious about it. I'm like, ""What if we created a community and it has its own capital in the form of crypto?” What if we create a citadel in New Hampshire? We have our own source of power, whether that's in the form of solar or small-scale micro nuclear reactor. This produces enough energy to power, say, 100 homes, and also run a data center where you can mine bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. That's how you earn capital.  You build an institution of higher learning attached to this community, you build a religious organization. So it's a nonprofit, and people can donate to this without paying capital gains. You could donate your appreciated crypto into this entity to build things that are social goods. People have historically called that religion. But it doesn’t need to anchor around a Judeo-Christian idea. It can anchor around any shared set of beliefs.  Any other ideas for this cult?  We can build open-source tooling and infrastructure. You can spin up all of these small-scale communities – physical and digital – and because the underlying substrate you're using is an open-source protocol, these communities can be interoperable. They could trade with one another, transact with one another, connect.  I’m still trying to figure out what our rituals should be. They’re gonna be metal though.  You can build this really interesting mycelial network of self-sovereign, small, little pockets. They can all have slightly different ideologies. But they share a core set of beliefs where the future is self-sovereign, decentralized and insert your favorite crypto trope here.  That's what I've been hacking on. That's what Alex and I are gonna talk about at Consensus. I'm hyped.  What’s your role in the cult?  High priestess. I think high priestess is a good honorific. And I’m still trying to figure out what our rituals should be. They’re gonna be metal though. They’re gonna be real weird and real heavy metal.  Happy to help brainstorm.  Think about your honorific. Think about what color robe you want to wear. Maybe some face tats? The world is your oyster!  Thanks Meltem. Let’s do this again before four more years.

This arises as a result of Terra&apos;s stablecoin (UST) losing its peg to the US dollar, which resulted in the price of LUNA plummeting nearly 100% from its previous high of $97 to about 2 cents in less than 48 hours. A few minutes later, Terra sent a further tweet in which it said that validators are now working to restart the network within a few minutes by implementing a patch to disable further delegations. Following the completion of the patch, according to the message on Twitter, delegations will be terminated, and block production will then restart.

Bitcoin Trading Volume Surges To Highest Value Since December As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the latest bloodbath in the crypto market has awakened BTC&apos;s spot trading volume. The &apos;trading volume&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin being moved on the chain on any given day. When the value of this metric rises, it means the market is becoming more active as investors trade larger amounts of the crypto. On the other hand, a downtrend in the indicator suggests the Bitcoin market activity is going down at the moment. Historically, high trading volumes have made up for an ideal environment for pushing large price moves. This is because to sustain any such move, a large number of active traders are needed.

42411803,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg5wR,1652380753,What Are BIPs and Why Do They Matter?,"Bitcoin, the world's oldest and largest blockchain, has been around since 2011. Still, despite its more than a decade-long existence, it hasn't changed that much.  That is because Bitcoin is truly decentralized, and the community of the network prioritizes the security and predictability of the blockchain above everything else.  Still, from time to time, there are upgrades in how Bitcoin works – sometimes just a small tweak, other times a change as big as Taproot, which took three years in the making and enabled developers to integrate new features to improve the privacy, scalability and security of the blockchain.  And behind every implementation of an upgrade, there is a successful ""BIP.""  Read more: Can the Bitcoin Network Scale?  So, what is a BIP?  Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is a standardized way to pitch any change to how the Bitcoin blockchain works.  Given that the blockchain is software, think about BIPs as software updates. Their goal is to improve the Bitcoin blockchain, and they must include all the technical details of the change in the blockchain’s code to implement it.  Because Bitcoin doesn't have centralized leadership, BIPs make it possible for the community to communicate ideas, draft and propose technical changes and eventually vote on accepting or opposing the proposal.  The proposals and discussions are available or anyone to see on GitHub, which is a popular open-source platform among software developers.  Who can submit a BIP?  Theoretically, anyone can suggest an upgrade and flesh it out as a BIP, because Bitcoin is an open-source, decentralized network.  That said, it’s highly recommended to throw an idea into community forums and email lists to discuss whether the proposal has enough backing among those who participate in the Bitcoin network.  How a BIP gets approved  First, the idea needs a BIP champion who will be the author of the proposal. Champions convert the idea into detailed technical documentation according to the BIP standards.  Then, the BIP champion submits the proposal to the BIP editor, who acts as an auditor of the proposal and is responsible for its administration.  The editor’s responsibilities include editing for language and format according to the standards, checking the technical feasibility of the proposal and ensuring it is well prepared to proceed for a vote. The editor can request revisions from the author or even reject it. If the editor says the proposal is ready to proceed, it gets an official number (for example, BIP 119) and the champion presents the BIP to the community.  The BIP has to go through different stages before it can be implemented.  Draft: The BIP is submitted to the mailing list and GitHub repository of the Bitcoin community.  Proposed: The BIP includes a plan on how to implement the change in the blockchain.  Final: The BIP is accepted and ready to be implemented.  Implementation consists of two steps. First, the upgrade has to be merged into the blockchain's software code (Bitcoin Core), then it has to be activated. The Taproot upgrade, for example, was merged in October 2020 and activated in November 2021. (Note: Not all BIPs that get merged into the code will ultimately be accepted and activated.)  Proposals can take years until they get implemented, as the community discusses the idea, makes changes and finally reaches a consensus. To minimize controversy and long, drawn-out discussions, a BIP should be focused on one single, key change.  Since Bitcoin doesn’t have central authority, nodes – those who run the Bitcoin blockchain and make it secure – have to agree on the rules and reach consensus on how to run the network. The nodes decide if they activate the proposals by agreeing to run the version of Bitcoin’s code that includes any new changes.  A soft fork introduces a change in the blockchain that is compatible with the older version, making it possible for nodes to run the “old version of the software” without any interruptions. A BIP that proposes implementation with a soft fork requires a “clear miner majority,"" meaning that over 90% of nodes have to approve to upgrade. These are called ""Consensus BIPs.""  Hard fork BIPs – a radical upgrade that basically creates a new blockchain, rendering the old one invalid – can hardly ever get universal approval from the community because they would require adoption from everyone who participates in the Bitcoin economy, including nodes, exchanges, wallet providers and so on.  Read more: Hard Fork vs Soft Fork  Not all BIPs propose changes in the code directly. Standard BIPs establish a new standard to services that use the Bitcoin software such as exchanges. They might require universal approval to maintain interoperability between those that use the blockchain.  Some proposals called Process BIPs introduce new processes and decision-making in the network – they propose rules on how to make rules.  Notable BIPs  BIP 001 and BIP 002  The very first proposal, the BIP 001, was filed by Indian-British programmer Amir Taaki in September 2011, and it described what a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal is. The BIP-002 then revised the guidelines for BIPs and replaced BIP-001. Both are examples of Process BIPs.  BIP 008 and BIP 009  These are two Process BIPs that introduced a standard framework on how to activate soft fork upgrades to the Bitcoin blockchain.  BIP 141  This was a Standard BIP that established the standardized format for SegWit addresses in the broader SegWit (Segmented Witness) upgrade that consisted of various BIPs and modified how Bitcoin stores data.  Taproot  Taproot, the largest upgrade recently in the Bitcoin blockchain, was actually a melting pot of three BIPs (BIP 340, BIP 341 and BIP 342). It stemmed from a proposal by software developer Greg Maxwell in January 2018. After that, three BIPs codified the upgrade championed by Bitcoin developers Pieter Wuille, Tim Ruffing, A.J. Townes and Jonas Nick.  The long-anticipated upgrade went live in November 2021 – almost four years after the initial proposal – and gave Bitcoin developers an expanded toolbox to work with to build on the blockchain.

Due to this, DeFi protocols seem to be increasingly under the threat of attacks via illicit activities, according to a recent analysis published by Chainalysis. Over the course of the last three years, however, this kind of activity has become a less major component of the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem, which will surely be a cause of worry for several crypto enthusiasts. From the report, out of the $1.68 billion worth of cryptocurrencies stolen from the start of this year till May 1, 97% of it has come from DeFi protocols. This is due to the fact that their decentralized nature makes it more difficult to monitor the flow of cash. Where Exactly Is All of That Money Going? The majority of the losses have been caused by the theft of funds via hacking, which has been accompanied by a rise in the use of DeFi protocols for money laundering as well, with the majority of them going to hacker organizations that are affiliated with the government of North Korea. These groups have stolen over $840 million in just this year alone via breaches of DeFi protocols.

While interest rates fall, the value of government bonds rises. In this case, the Euro-Bund-Future, commonly regarded as a safe haven, is an excellent indicator. In contrast to the rest of the market, defensive stocks such as utilities, consumer staples, and so on are popular. This is because they pay fixed dividends and have consistent income. As a result, defensive stocks perform worse than the market as a whole when the market is growing. Investors withdraw their money from stocks by selling their shares in a risk-off market. They also avoid risky assets such as high-yielding currencies. In this type of market, safe investments such as US Treasury bills and German bunds perform well.

42411812,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg6QC,1652377723,"3 Signals a Crypto Crash May Be Coming, According to Experts","Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $550 billion, is down 47% from its all-time high of $69,000 achieved only six months ago, as of this writing. Perhaps you're caught by surprise when the cryptocurrency market goes down. But for professional traders and market analysts, crashes are often foreshadowed by telltale signs and patterns.  Depending on their disciplinary background and methodological conviction, traders and market analysts can gauge the market sentiment in three ways:  Macro indicators  Technical analysis  On-chain analytics  Each approach draws on different data, but all can be used to equal effect when predicting market movements.  Here are the favorite tools of traders and analysts interviewed by CoinDesk and how they use them to look for bearish signs in the cryptocurrency markets, spearheaded by bitcoin’s price movements.  Macro indicators and crypto crashes  Although bitcoin is often billed as a non-correlated asset, meaning that investors can hedge against the traditional market, that narrative does not hold in the face of recent evidence that bitcoin is highly correlated to equities. And at a time when the macro conditions (inflation, monetary tightening, stocks, etc.) are unfavorable, bitcoin’s correlation to traditional finance isn’t good news.  Read More: The Link Between Bitcoin and Inflation  “I think the most important thing to watch is what central banks are telling you and then how the market reacts to it. The correlation of bitcoin and [ether] to the Nasdaq is extraordinarily high, and I wouldn't expect that to change in the near term. For the time being, we are trading more macro than usual in crypto,” Jonathan Cheesman, former Goldman Sachs (GS) and HSBC (HABC) executive and current head of FTX Access (the institutional sales of crypto exchange FTX), told CoinDesk.  According to an April 2022 report by Arcane Research, bitcoin’s correlation to the Nasdaq reached all-time highs of 0.70.  Analysts measure correlation on a -1 to 1 scale, where -1 means the prices move in the complete opposite direction and 1 means they are perfectly synced. The report’s author, Vetle Lunde, an analyst at Arcane, told CoinDesk that “the correlations across asset classes are in an extreme state,” highlighting bitcoin’s all-time high correlation to equities and simultaneously negative correlation to gold and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). “It’s unlike anything seen in the market,” he said.  But the correlation doesn’t mean bitcoin follows equities, per se. There’s virtually zero time lag between bitcoin and equities, so they generally go down or up at the same time. And in some cases, bitcoin falls or rises before the Nasdaq.  “Maybe it's caused by liquidity, resting market orders and more variations across market makers reacting to news in the equity markets, whereas the major market makers in crypto have a less varied response formula,” Lunde said.  Macro headwinds, such as the extraordinarily high inflation in both the U.S. and Europe, are, however, just one part of the macro narrative.  “The way I think about crypto and its relationship to the macro. You have structural macro forces and you have cyclical macro forces,” said Cheesman. Structural macro forces, such as de-dollarization and young people’s affinity with decentralized alternatives, are bullish for crypto, he explained.  But until the bullish macro forces kick in, there’s reason to be cautious. “I certainly would urge people to be fairly careful and patient with how they look forward. The worst may be behind us in terms of peak inflation, but we haven't got peak tightening yet,” Cheesman said.  Read More: 4 Things to Do in a Crypto Bear Market  Bearish signs in technical analysis  Technical analysis (TA) – the study of candlestick price charts – is a major toolbox for traders.  Josh Olszewicz, head of research at digital asset investment firm Valkyrie Investments, told CoinDesk that he uses Bollinger Bands, a popular price volatility gauge, to understand where bitcoin is headed. Things seem bearish for the leading cryptocurrency at the moment judging by this tool, he said.  Bollinger Bands (yellow lines below) expand or contract based on two standard deviations – a mathematical calculation – from the “20-period moving average” (red line below) of the bitcoin price. The 20-period moving average often refers to the average price over the last 20-candle period.  The chart below shows us three things, said Olszewicz:  Volatility has rarely declined to this level since 2011.  Volatility does not usually fall much further before a volatility expansion.  Whenever volatility has fallen this much, it has always exploded soon enough.  Olszewicz said that based on the weekly Bollinger Bands, the market is bearish as bitcoin continues to close below the 20-week moving average of $42,700 at the time of writing.  Oher TA tools are favored by crypto traders, many of whom are independent day traders.  EZCharts, a pseudonymous crypto trader, told CoinDesk that to test a bearish direction, he mostly looks at bitcoin’s weekly price closes and wicks. As time passes, bitcoin price forms certain shapes on the chart, giving indications of its direction. “Currently, the market has rallied a bit off our local lows but is forming a very clear bear flag (see the chart below). A bear flag is a technical analysis pattern that points towards downside continuation. Because we formed our macro double top we can see that the trend has been down, and based off this continuation pattern, it seems likely bitcoin will head lower in the near term,” he said.  Cyborg, another pseudonymous crypto trader, said he believes the majority of “nukes” (a term for sudden price plunges among crypto traders) come from two sources: money flowing out of bitcoin and into altcoins, and separately, derivatives getting caught offside.  For the former, he monitors the Altcoin Season Index. To understand if the derivatives are offside, he follows the open interest/volume in relation to price. One way to monitor this is to look at the spot/derivatives delta, which is the difference between the spot price (bitcoin’s current market price) and the derivatives index (bitcoin futures).  “If derivatives indexes are still trading above the spot price on the start of a downtrend, then it means the market is overheated. The end of overheated derivatives markets is brutal,” he said.  Understanding the bottom through on-chain analytics  As the majority of cryptocurrencies use public blockchains to verify and record transactions, the data is available “on-chain” for everyone to see. This has given rise to on-chain analytics, which looks at transaction data and crypto wallet balances to understand market conditions.  On-chain analysis can tell us if bitcoin were to fall and how low it may go.  Whalemap, an on-chain analytics tool, popularized a metric called “realized price by cohort.” The metric calculates the average price that bitcoins were acquired by different types of wallets on the blockchain, such as “whales” who hold between 10 and 100 BTC.  “Tracking those players’ realized price gives great accurate indications of macro supports,” Whalemap told CoinDesk. The realized price for the 10-100 BTC wallet cohort has identified every “generational bottom” (the lowest price in each cycle) for bitcoin so far, as indicated in the chart shared with CoinDesk.  The band currently resides between $27,000 and $25,000, as per the data. If bitcoin’s price was to start falling, “this should serve as a long-term support for BTC that we can be historically confident in,” Whalemap said.  But that’s a big if – there’s no definite way to tell after all. EZCharts, a pseudonymous trader quoted above with a bearish take, told CoinDesk that “some people are bullish here. It wouldn’t be a market unless some were bullish and some were bearish.”  Read More: Is There a ""Best"" Time to Trade Crypto?

42395403,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASwslP,1652377413,Crypto Risk Monitoring Firm Solidus Labs Raises $45M,"Crypto security startup Solidus Labs has raised $45 million in a Series B funding round led by Liberty City Ventures at an undisclosed valuation. The funding will help launch threat intelligence capabilities and build out the research and development team to address use cases specific to decentralized finance (DeFi).  In March, Solidus Labs unveiled Halo, a machine learning driven crypto-native trade surveillance and market intelligence hub that provides institutional-grade regulatory risk and compliance solutions. Halo is monitoring more than 1 trillion trading events per day in over 150 markets, according to the press release.  The startup was founded in 2018 by Asaf Meir, Praveen Kumar and Chen Arad – a team of former Goldman Sachs (GS) engineers and cybersecurity professionals. Solidus has seen a 560% increase in year-over-year revenue growth and 250% growth in the number of clients, a company spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email. The firm had 10 employees at the start of 2020 and has now grown to nearly 100 with the goal of doubling that headcount within the next year.  Blockchain security breaches and lapses have caused more than $1 billion in losses so far this year. The losses included $326 million in an exploit of blockchain bridge Wormhole, a $625 million breach of the Ronin Network underlying play-to-earn game Axie infinity and a $182 million loss for the Beanstalk stablecoin protocol.  Earlier this year, Solidus launched the Crypto Market Integrity Coalition (CMIC), a group of 30 firms pleading to advance safety in the crypto market. The group includes Coinbase (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD), Gemini, GSR, Circle and BitStamp.  Solidus Labs also has the support of several former regulators. The startup hired Kathy Kraninger, former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) director, last year as its vice president of regulatory affairs. Angel investors and advisors in the startup include former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo (aka “Crypto Dad”), who is also a Web 3 regulatory advisor at crypto venture capital fund CoinFund, and former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Troy Paredes.  Liberty City Ventures is a venture capital fund and incubator with over $1.5 billion in assets under management, according to the firm. Other participants in the round include Evolution Equity Partners, Declaration Partners, Hanaco Ventures and Avon Ventures, a venture capital fund affiliated with FMR LLC, the parent of Fidelity Investments.  Solidus Labs raised nearly $40 million in capital last year between two funding rounds.  “How fast crypto and DeFi will be able to grow depends on how effective critical guardrails and checks and balances are - and Solidus is consistently leading the market in providing innovative, crypto-native market integrity solutions,” said Liberty City Ventures Partner Emil Woods in the press release.

A block explorer confirmed the network had restarted after Terraform Labs, the company behind the Terra ecosystem, tweeted that the network had halted at block height 7603700. Terraform said the price of LUNA fell too low to ""prevent governance attacks,"" citing LUNA inflation as one factor. By late Thursday, LUNA had fallen to less than 1 cent from nearly $120 in early April.  The Terra ecosystem includes the LUNA governance token and several algorithmic stablecoins, including TerraUSD (UST).  The blockchain being halted meant no transactions with UST, LUNA or Terra's other cryptocurrencies could be processed. Token holders had to wait for the blockchain to restart.  Terraform said the network's validators ""will coordinate"" to restart the network shortly, once a patch to limit how many new parties could act as validators on the network was applied.  LUNA's price plummeted by over $80 in three days. UST, one of the paired stablecoins, broke its peg to the U.S. dollar on Monday, dropping to 37 cents at press time. Terraform issued more than 1 billion LUNAs as circulating supply as part of an effort to reduce the selling pressure seen since Monday.  The UST stablecoin, which is supposed to maintain price parity with the U.S. dollar, lost its peg over the last weekend, but briefly recovered. It fell again on Monday, dropping to as low as 27 cents and has yet to recover its peg with the dollar.

42411461,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO4tV,1652372792,"Terra, Web 3 and Acceptable Risk in Innovation","As the process of price discovery continues, and traders of bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets are trying to find where these markets will bottom out, it’s worth taking a moment to ask why you’re still in the game. Presuming you haven’t been liquidated.  The UST-LUNA situation will almost certainly end up in the cannon of financial history. Terra’s UST was a breakout success for algorithmic stablecoins – a type of financial asset that seeks to create a bridge to the U.S. dollar-based economy while maintaining the precepts of decentralization and tech-reliance in crypto – but has stumbled spectacularly.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  There are a lot of things that factor into the rise of the Terra network – prominent backers, a convincing leader, the larger crypto market bullrun. But perhaps most significantly was its central promise. Do Kwon, the founder of UST builders Terraform Labs, was constructing a galaxy of financial applications built around his stablecoin – picking and choosing ideas from both traditional and decentralized finance.  It was the whole package: a “stable” asset, a bevy of lending and savings technologies and even a stock exchange. Most, if not all, of this activity was playing on the riskier side of legality. But the dangers were worth it for Kwon, who wants finance to be freely accessible – bucking the constraints of the law and, as it turns out, blockchain technology.  It’s reasonable to look at this situation as representative of crypto. The current crisis with UST, even if it recovers, will be a stain on pure algos. Others might ask something broader, which is where is all of the experimentation leading? Should we pack up our bags?  The story is still unfolding about how or why Terra’s cosmos imploded – it could have been an orchestrated attack that exploited known issues with the network or a collapse of faith in the community after facing slight pressure. But it’s clear enough that if this could happen to Terra, other decentralized networks might be similarly exposed.  So if decentralized networks face natural limits (and they do), and may be open to economic exploitation (and they are, by design), are the risks worth it?  Read more: It Can't Be 'Decentralization or Bust' | Opinion  Ryan Broderick, a Boston-based blogger who writes about internet ephemera, raised a similar question in a recent essay about Web 2. The argument in this piece, “No ads, no games, no gimmicks, no money,” is that there’s a contradiction in the web as we know it.  The internet is best because it is open and free. But the internet also requires architecture to be built and maintained; so far, the only way we’ve reliably found to fund that activity is through applications that make the internet less open and less free, Broderick argues.  He’s talking about the Web Giants – Google, Facebook, Amazon and the like – that create the tools we use most. These applications are not free, of course, even if there isn’t always a price tag attached. We pay for robust internet services with hidden costs: data mining, social strife … you know the argument.  Broderick also argues that some of Web 2’s success comes from masses of people sorta misusing the platforms or finding use that wasn’t by design. He called TikTok a “free Adobe Premiere for your phone” and YouTube “the main hub for cultural criticism on the internet,” rather than social media services.  “Web 2.0 apps don’t even know what they’re actually being used for half the time,” he argued. That’s a powerful idea that speaks to the internet’s value because it is open and free and open to experimentation, even when that comes at a cost.  The reason Broderick writes is because he thinks this model – call it surveillance capitalism meets unintentional design – is unsustainable. There’s also something on the horizon that worries him, though he never names it.  Web 3 promises an alternative to the extractive model of the web – one where users don’t have to rely on the good graces of well-heeled corporations to build or not destroy the platforms we use – because it’s said to be “community owned.”  Its benefit, if you believe the Web 3 developers and funders, is that it can ensure the internet remains open. It may not be “free,” but its costs might be explicit. That is, if it doesn’t explode.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/12/terra-web-3-and-acceptable-risk-in-innovation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a968f24ac79bca0acdb66881eef5b4608231176-2048x1366.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Teller Finance, a cryptocurrency infrastructure provider that's looking to create no-collateral lending in DeFi, is offering holders of dollar-backed stablecoin USDC the chance to lend capital to a travel insurance company.  According to an announcement on Thursday, Teller's CreditFi platform uses crypto rails built by Teller and Ensuro, a platform that gathers decentralized capital for insurance technology companies, to connect liquidity providers with travel insurance firm Koala.  “When we started thinking about how to bring loan requests from businesses on-chain, Koala was one of the first companies that reached out,” Teller Finance CEO Ryan Berkun said in an interview. “So you have a travel insurance company that makes money on the premiums and a good portion of those premiums go back to lenders who are supplying the capital for the travel insurance. This adds huge diversification to the type of lending opportunities that are offered and DeFi today.”  Read more: IMA Financial Plans to Start Selling NFT Insurance in Decentraland  DeFi diversification is an intuitive direction to follow, not least because total locked value (TVL) is dropping in line with token prices. The traditional lending world uses data like a company’s balance sheet and income statements to assess the probability of that business being able to repay a loan. Meanwhile, crypto lending tends to be overcollateralized, and so you need $150 of ether to get $100 of cash, for example.  Today, at initiation, the loans will be up to 90 days. The interest rates that lenders could see are anywhere between 8% to 15%, according to Berkun.  Koala, which isn’t backed by a large insurance broker or carrier, has so far gathered a capital pool of about $450,000 for its Koala Flex product, which allows travelers to cancel their trip at the click of a button and get their money back. Doing so requires the capacity to provide a lot of refunds if necessary, explained Koala Insurance CEO Ugo Weyl, adding that risk-averse insurance and reinsurance firms tend to shy away from this type of innovation.  “We had a lot of pushback, and we didn’t manage to find support for that,” Weyl said in an interview. “So at the beginning we started selling Flex out of our own balance sheet, taking the risk directly ourselves within a scale we were comfortable with. Then we started working with Teller and other companies as well, to see how DeFi could bring us that capacity and that capital that the regular market was not willing to give us.”",POSITIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/12/teller-finance-wants-to-diversify-defi-with-travel-insurance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5b3de073bfd60a8963194ac7fedb654372002e9-4500x2610.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Shares of Galaxy have plunged more than 40% this week and were down over 20% on Wednesday. They were falling 1.6% to US$8.02 on Thursday.  In its recent management discussion and analysis filing for the quarter ending March 31, Galaxy said the largest contributor in the quarter to its $355 million in net realized gains on its digital assets came from sales of LUNA. Galaxy had previously said in its fourth-quarter earnings release that it held $407.6 million worth of LUNA as of Dec. 31.  “Our takeaway from GLXY’s disclosures regarding its LUNA exposure is that it appears that the company had sold all or most of its position at a healthy gain during 1Q22, reflecting the token’s strong appreciation during 2021,” Palmer wrote.  Galaxy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) recently lost its 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar, while Terra’s native LUNA token extended its precipitous decline this week.  BTIG reiterated a buy rating on Galaxy with a C$37 ($28) price target.

NFTs are files or tokens encrypted digitally for recording ownership of an item. This NFT could be a piece of art, a video of a memorable moment in sports activities, or more. The tokens are non-fungible. It implies that the assets they represent are unique, and one cannot easily exchange for a similar good at the same price.

Alder was speaking at an online conference organized by the think tank Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF). Alder, who is also the CEO of Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission, said the growth of digital currency markets and their increasing connection to mainstream finance has made crypto a top focus area for regulators around the world.  ""Crypto has obviously rocketed up the agenda,"" Alder said, adding that crypto is now one of the three 'C's' that represent the top focus area for regulators, alongside COVID and climate change.  The financial world is focused on crypto this week as markets crashed, exacerbated by the collapse of the stablecoin terraUSD (UST). Early Thursday, bitcoin (BTC) was trading at a 16-month low.  ""If you look at the risks we need to address, they are multiple, and there is a wall of worry about [crypto] in the conversations at an institutional level,"" Alder said.  According to Alder, a global group designed to coordinate crypto rules is clearly needed. Alder said that global climate finance efforts are ""far ahead"" compared to crypto regulation, despite the importance of crypto in the global conversation.

42411805,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glg69f,1652363919,Algorithmic Stablecoins: What They Are and How They Can Go Terribly Wrong,"Cryptocurrencies are known for volatility; they can go up and down in double digits. But one form of cryptocurrency, called stablecoins, aims to provide refuge to those who want to exit constant volatility while still staying in the crypto market.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are supposed to be pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. In the cases of USD-pegged stablecoins, their prices are supposed to be $1 at all times.  Each stablecoin project differs in ways they maintain the peg. The two biggest ones, tether (USDT) and Circle's usd coin (USDC), are “over-collateralized” by fiat reserves, meaning they have cash or cash-equivalent assets in their reserves. So each USDT or USDC traded in the crypto market is backed by what’s actually in the possession of the stablecoin issuers. Similarly, MakerDAO’s stablecoin DAI is decentralized but also overcollateralized – backed by ether (ETH) deposited into its smart contracts.  Over the past year, however, a new form of stablecoin has emerged that differs in its collateralization: algorithmic stablecoins, such as terraUSD (UST), magic internet money (MIM), frax (FRAX) and neutrino usd (USDN).  They’re called algorithmic because what backs them is an on-chain algorithm that facilitates a change in supply and demand between them (the stablecoin) and another cryptocurrency that props them up.  In the case of the Terra blockchain, which runs the largest algorithmic stablecoin platform, the algorithmic tango is performed by UST, a stablecoin, and terra (LUNA), Terra’s native cryptocurrency that backs the stablecoin. For the remainder of this article, we will use “LUNA” to refer to terra (LUNA) to avoid any confusion.  Read More: What Is LUNA and UST? A Guide to the Terra Ecosystem  Algorithmic stablecoins are typically undercollateralized – they don’t have independent assets in reserves to back the value of their stablecoins. In fact, “undercollateralized stablecoins” and “algorithmic stablecoins” are often used interchangeably.  What are algorithmic stablecoins?  Algorithm can be an obfuscating word. But it simply means a set of code that instructs a process. So, for example, what you get to see on your Facebook timeline is determined by Facebook’s timeline algorithms, which include things like how relevant the post is to you based on your past online behavior. In crypto, an algorithm refers to pieces of code on the blockchain, as encoded in a set of smart contracts.  Algorithmic stablecoins typically rely on two tokens – one stablecoin and another cryptocurrency that backs the stablecoins – and so the algorithm (or the smart contact) regulates the relationship between the two.  Cryptocurrencies – similar to all assets in the market, such as houses or stocks – move up and down in price depending on the market demand and the supply of the asset. This also includes stablecoins because they’re essentially cryptocurrencies freely traded on the market.  To prevent the price of a stablecoin depegging – moving away from $1 – while subject to market conditions, algorithms regulate supply and demand. When there’s too much demand for an asset but little supply of it, the price of that asset goes up – and vice versa.  The algorithm’s promise is to keep this in check, as we explore in the context of UST in the next section, before delving deeper into how that can go terribly wrong.  How is UST designed to maintain its peg?  TerraUSD (UST) maintains – or is supposed to maintain – its 1:1 parity with the U.S. dollar via an algorithmic relationship with Terra’s native cryptocurrency, LUNA. Behind the relationship is an arbitrage opportunity that presents itself every time UST loses its peg in either direction.  When the UST supply is too small and demand for it is too high, the price of UST goes above $1. To bring UST back to its peg, the Terra protocol lets users trade 1 USD of LUNA for 1 UST at the Terra station portal. This trade burns 1 USD of LUNA and mints 1 UST, which users can sell for 1.01 USD and pocket a profit of 1 cent. It doesn’t sound like a lot, but these profits add up when done in large quantities.  Read More: Crypto Arbitrage Trading: How to Make Low-Risk Gains  Users can mint as much UST as needed from burned LUNA until UST goes back down to $1. As the supply increases, the price eventually comes down – or that’s at least the logic behind it.  When the supply is too large and demand is too low, the opposite happens: The price of UST goes below $1. So the protocol lets users do the opposite as above: Users can buy 1 UST for 0.99 USD, then trade 1 UST for 1 USD of LUNA. The trade burns 1 UST and mints 1 USD of LUNA, netting the arbitrage trader a profit of .01 UST.  Again, the Terra protocol lets users continuously burn UST and receive LUNA until UST reaches $1.  The second scenario – value falling below the peg – is a more common problem for algorithmic stablecoins, as the market anxiety around them is more common than market euphoria, resulting in more instances of lower demand and higher supply.  UST’s algorithmic relationship with LUNA means that the latter has to absorb the volatility of the former. Since new LUNA can be continuously minted any time UST is below $1, the price of LUNA can free-fall in the face of increasing token supply.  In response to mounting criticism that UST is in a vulnerable state with no external backing mechanism – independent collateral assets – Do Kwon, the CEO of Terra creator Terraform Labs and the main man behind UST, set up Luna Foundation Guard in February 2022, an entity in charge of maintaining the stablecoin’s peg. It has – or had – a goal of buying as much as $10 billion in bitcoin (BTC) to support the peg.  How did UST depeg in May 2022?  First slowly, then suddenly.  UST began depegging on May 7, as large-volume withdrawals from Terra’s largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Anchor began in earnest. These had a domino effect on the UST pool on Ethereum’s Curve Protocol, the main hub for stablecoin liquidity in all of DeFi, which also saw high-volume withdrawals.  Some blame the events that led to UST’s depegging on a coordinated attack. Others think it was a series of spontaneous panic-ridden withdrawals due to the souring wider market conditions, especially in the price of bitcoin that LFG has added to its reserve to back UST. In either case, the stablecoin hasn’t withstood the pressure enough to maintain its peg, eventually falling as low as $0.29 on May 11.  Since LFG, the entity that defends UST’s peg, has so much bitcoin in reserve, some analysts think it may have also fueled bitcoin’s price crash, as many feared the organization could dump billions of bitcoin. But it’s a double whammy: Falling bitcoin price also meant the LFG has less ammunition in its arsenal.  Read More: The LUNA and UST Crash Explained in 5 Charts  But isn’t this where the algorithm should work its magic?  The algorithm, which is supposed to burn UST and mint LUNA when UST is below $1, hasn’t worked as well; it’s failed to keep up with the extreme conditions. According to a proposal submitted by Kwon on May 11, the algorithm couldn’t facilitate the minting of new LUNAs at a speed needed to re-peg UST (it had to outrun the market speed, and it couldn’t), and so a proposed change in code would alter the mint cap and speed up the algorithmic process. The proposal, if passed, would see more LUNA minted in a shorter span of time.  Defending UST means sacrificing LUNA’s price since it increases LUNA’s supply, and greater supply means selling pressure on a token’s price. As a result, LUNA violently crashed during the night of May 11, falling more than 97% to as low as $0.88.  An elaborate explanation of the May 11 proposal states, “In extreme situations like this, Terra cannot save both UST peg, and save LUNA price at the same time.”  Read More: What’s the Point of Stablecoins?",NEUTRAL,BTC | LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Ekin Genç,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/algorithmic-stablecoins-what-they-are-and-how-they-can-go-terribly-wrong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/558716baac9ba3f075c33384af1ffef2b70743c0-2119x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423370,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YnTh,1652363756,First Mover Americas: BTC Drops to 2020 Levels of $25K; Tether Loses $1 Peg,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Market Moves: Bitcoin traders took a beating overnight as long liquidations surged, while Tether's USDT stablecoin lost its $1 peg.  Feature: We take a look at what Terra thinks is the easiest way to return the UST to a peg.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) briefly hit lows of $25,200 in the early hours of Thursday morning as Tether's stablecoin USDT lost its $1 peg, continuing this week's carnage in crypto markets.  Bitcoin is trading down 20% over the last seven days and has not seen levels this low since December 2020.  USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, dipped to 97 cents in Asian trading hours, losing its parity with the U.S. dollar. It hit as low as 96 cents on Coinbase.  Terra’s UST stablecoin also continued to flounder, hitting levels as low as $0.28, according to CoinDesk data.  “UST de-pegging has caused market-wide ripple effects,” said Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index platform. “What we are seeing now is panic. People running for the exits and losing faith.”  In traditional markets, the S&P 500 has lost over 4.5% this week. The Nasdaq composite fell to its lowest level since November 2020, falling by more than 3%.  Market Moves  Over the last seven days, BTC has not pushed above the $35,000 mark, according to data from Messari.  Martha Reyes, head of research at Bequant, said in an email with CoinDesk that the markets in meltdown might present an opportunity for institutional players to start building positions and push stablecoin regulation to provide more confidence.  “While we can't call the bottom and correlations among asset classes remain elevated, bitcoin has survived corrections of 70-80% in the past. This may be an opportunity for institutions to build positions at better levels,” said Reyes.  She added: “The uncertainty around stablecoins is a concern and could lead to another flush-out but we may finally get the much-needed regulatory framework that could entice institutions in. Regulators tend to be reactive, so this may be the catalyst for greater stablecoin regulation.”  Liquidations  BTC long liquidations took a beating overnight too. According to data from Coinglass, over the last 24 hours, $430 million was liquidated.  Long liquidations took up $277 million and shorts accounted for $198 million.  “This is a standard event you see in conventional futures markets and is now taking its toll on the crypto markets due to the nascent asset and the lack of experienced investors using these instruments,” said Hashdex’s head of Europe, Laurent Kssis.  According to Kssis, the fact that long liquidations are dominating the market could push the price of BTC down further.  “$30,000 was the key support level, so $25,000 could be a resistance now the $30K level has been broken,” said Kssis.  Latest Headlines  Citadel Securities, BlackRock, Gemini Slam Social Media Accusations of Involvement With UST Collapse A conspiracy theory that began on 4chan and was amplified by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has been met with swift denials by all parties  Terra Proposes Token Burn and Increase in Pool Size to Stop UST Dilution Terra believes that decreasing the amount of UST in circulation, while increasing the amount of available LUNA, is the easiest way to return the UST to a peg.  Terra’s LUNA Has Dropped 99.7% in Under a Week. That’s Good for UST LUNA tokens lost 96% in the past 24 hours alone, prompting more to be minted in a mechanism that helped lift the UST price.  Cathie Wood's Ark Invest Grabs More Than Half a Million Coinbase Shares as Exchange's Stock Plummets Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) plunged 26.4% in post-market trading on Wednesday, after reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings.  Ether Futures Lead $1.2B in Liquidations, Crypto Market Cap Drops 16% Overnight Ether futures led liquidation losses in the past 24 hours as crypto markets lost over 16% of their overall capitalization, data from multiple sources shows.  Terra-Based DeFi Protocol Anchor Proposes Cutting UST Yield Rates to 4% The proposal comes amid ongoing concerns regarding the long-term stability of Terra tokens LUNA and UST.  Terra Proposes Token Burn and Increase in Pool Size to Stop UST Dilution  By Sam Reynolds  Terra believes that the downwards pressure on UST’s peg is diluting LUNA, impeding recovery for both while creating an excess of UST, and the way to solve this is through burning UST and increasing the available pool of LUNA.  “The primary obstacle is expelling the bad debt from UST circulation at a clip fast enough for the system to restore the health of on-chain spreads,” said Terra in a Tweet.  Algorithmic stablecoins like UST are supposed to be automatically pegged to the price of another currency. As explained in a prior CoinDesk learn article, traders can swap LUNA for UST at $1 regardless of the market price because the algorithms in the back end will manage the supply of LUNA creating enough scarcity to justify the $1.  A token burn refers to taking crypto out of circulation on the blockchain. It can be thought of as a deflationary event, because it would increase the value of the remaining blockchain. For token holders, it would be a similar event to a share buyback.  In a proposal put forward to token holders, Terra said that it wants to burn the nearly 1 billion UST (roughly $690 million) in the community pool while increasing the Base Pool of LUNA available to 100 million which in turn increases minting capacity to over $1 billion. This will help expedite the outflows of UST from the system, and thus pushing it back closer to its peg, while pushing down the price of Luna.  “Currently, the burning of UST is too slow to keep pace with the demand for excess UST to exit the system, which is hindered by the BasePool size,” reads the proposal. “Eliminating a significant chunk of the excess UST supply at once will alleviate much of the peg pressure on UST.”  Some comments on the proposal asked if this happened because of a bug in Terra’s coding, or if it was also a product of a broader market downturn driven by the decline in bitcoin’s price.  Validators of the network are able to vote for this proposal. According to a vote tracker, the Yes side has received 50.47% of the vote while the abstain side has 49.1%. 87.8% of eligible voters have already cast a ballot, and the pass threshold is 50%.

The money will help develop three behind-the-meter (BTM) facilities, designed to convert wasted renewable energy into clean computing for services such as bitcoin (BTC) mining and artificial intelligence, according to a statement.  “Soluna is the only true green bitcoin company we’ve yet seen,” said Rob Day, a Spring Lane partner and co-founder. “Going after wasted renewable energy – ‘spilled power’ – is a compelling solution – and fixes both bitcoin’s climate problem and wind power’s grid problem.”  The first of the three projects, Dorothy, will be a 100 megawatt (MW) capacity data center connected to a Texas wind farm that produces more electricity than the grid can consume.  Energy from renewable sources, such as wind, sometimes overloads the power grid when the energy produced exceeds demand. Data centers like Soluna’s help manage the supply by running computing-intensive processes like crypto mining.  Dorothy will have 50MW of initial capacity and is expected to be activated in coming months.  The other two projects will “come from Soluna’s robust pipeline,” the statement said.  Soluna said the new capital brings total funding for data centers co-located with renewable energy assets to $100 million.  Most recently it closed a $29.2 million Series A preferred stock public offering and sold a business unit for $10.75 million.

Blue Studios said Thursday it is launching Wallio, a non-custodial family crypto wallet. The product stems from the company’s partnership with Unstoppable Domains, a Web 3 domain provider.  Unstoppable Domains’ Sandy Carter told CoinDesk in a phone interview that the goal of the shared wallet is to promote “multigenerational diversity” through a product that comes with tools to educate children and grandparents alike.  Families who sign up for Wallio ahead of its third quarter launch will be able to create a shared crypto wallet to deposit and receive digital assets. One family member will set up a profile and can add up to six additional accounts for the other family members.  Carter said the tie up with Unstoppable Domains lets family members create individual addresses with a name rather than a sequence of numbers, to prevent “getting rugged by typing in long addresses.”  Family crypto  Wallio isn’t the first family-oriented crypto wallet. Family investment application EarlyBird launched EarlyBird Crypto in January, a crypto extension of its original product for families to deposit digital assets into their children's accounts.  However, Wallio differs in that it aims to prioritize education on digital assets. Blue Studios will implement its play-to-earn and learn-to-earn technologies, where families can play games and complete modules to earn ether (ETH). According to the website, 3 ETH have been rewarded so far.  Providing family access to a crypto wallet raises concerns as to who gets to decide on what assets are sent and received. Not only will Wallio allow for users to establish controls on which members of the family can do so, but it will come with the ability to establish a Family DAO.  The Family DAO, inspired by a listener of Carter’s Twitter Spaces, will allow families to create a governance token for members to vote on measures pertaining to the wallet. Such measures include what tokens to invest in or what non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to purchase.  “There’s a lot of people talking about Web 3 but not a lot of people doing it,” said Carter, who hopes to inspire families to set up shared wallets and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and learn by doing.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/12/blue-studios-unstoppable-domains-roll-out-family-crypto-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5db4e3b2d7e0dad754edeab783f01008039fd71a-3968x2976.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But the financial industry still has mixed feelings towards crypto, misgivings that have only been amplified by the market turmoil of the last few months.  Perhaps nowhere is this better represented than in the towering personae of legendary investors and Berkshire Hathaway leaders Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett, both of whom have emerged as outspoken critics of digital assets and crypto not only as investments, but as concepts altogether.  The reluctance to manage crypto assets  To live up to the standards they’re governed by, fiduciary advisors have to straddle the line between enthusiasts and critics, but that doesn’t mean they have to embrace digital assets, said Scott Eichler, founder of Standing Oak Financial, a Newport Beach, California-based registered investment advisor (RIA).  “A lot of my clients privately own crypto, and we end up advising on it as well because it is part of their portfolio and asset allocation,” he said. “I don’t mind if a client wants it. I don’t mind building it in as part of their asset allocation, but I do mind accepting the fiduciary role of managing crypto. I don’t think we’re in a good position to act as fiduciaries in terms of trading and rebalancing crypto. We can give advice, but we can’t really act.”  Read More: How DAOs Can Empower Advisors and Investors  Eichler’s comments come in stark contrast to many crypto-positive advisors who believe there is a fiduciary duty to handle crypto on behalf of clients – instead, he believes that it is very difficult for an advisor to remain acting as a fiduciary and directly handle digital assets.  Advisors’ primary obstacle to handing crypto, according to Eichler, is information.  “There’s a number of things we’re supposed to do as far as fiduciary responsibilities go, and one of them is to be able to diversify the client’s assets and to be well-informed about their choices,” he said. “Last year alone something like 4,000 new coins hit the marketplace. It’s impossible to keep up unless it becomes our full-time job.”  Standing Oak is far from a conservative firm holding to traditional assets – Eichler himself is a proponent of investing in alternatives. But crypto is a new asset class, he said, that’s grown so quickly in such a short time frame that there’s no way a financial advisor with responsibilities to clients and all of their assets can keep up with the developments.  Eichler said that advisors still don’t have a well-functioning, multi-custodial system for trading assets outside of individual accounts. Standing Oak uses traditional RIA custodians like TD Ameritrade, which up until now have not offered advisors the ability to trade individual coins.  “I would have to keep track of every trade basically on paper,” Eichler said. “To my knowledge there is no system right now that will do all the trade-tracking and journaling and everything required as a fiduciary.”  Will crypto ETFs create more investment opportunities?  For many firms with these problems, the solution is found in a cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) or private placement product, which Eichler views as poor fits for individual investors and therefore inappropriate recommendations for fiduciary advisors.  But what if a low-cost, spot cryptocurrency ETF was approved by the SEC?  “At that point I kind of laugh, because the whole point of crypto seems to be to eliminate me or the middleman, and it’s become a question of whether I should assert the third-party nature of buying ETFs,” Eichler said. “The purpose of crypto is to eliminate the need for an ETF and an advisor. There are plenty of good coins to choose from with good track records, why would you come to me to invest in them? It would be like asking me to go and get you a $100 bill. If you really want it, you shouldn’t pay me a fee to do that.”  Instead, Eichler asks his clients to tell him how much money is invested in cryptocurrency, and how many different coins they are investing in, so he can add it to their asset allocation. Then he tracks the value of their crypto holdings over time, suggesting they buy or sell when an allocation is out of alignment with their portfolio’s goals.  It’s similar to how Standing Oak treats clients’ private real estate holdings, where advisors ask the value of the holding and the cash flow it produces so they can integrate it into a client’s overall portfolio and trade assets around the real estate holding to maintain an allocation.  Read More: How the Crypto Industry Cultivates Trust  The big difference: cryptocurrency is assigned a much higher risk weighting than an asset class like private real estate.  “I don’t act as a fiduciary here, I’m acting as an informed participant,” he said. “I’m not trading it, I’m not buying it, we’re just giving it an asset allocation and making sure it stays within those parameters. The asset allocation is already a fiduciary responsibility.”  FOMO, risk tolerance and volatility  As a fiduciary, Eichler also tries to ensure that a client’s crypto holdings reflect their capacity for risk and volatility.  “If they have a very low risk tolerance, I’ll tell them they shouldn’t invest in crypto, because it would cause them to take on too much standard deviation to bear emotionally when their portfolio goes down,” he said. “If they have a higher risk tolerance, they can take it on and it might be a great asset for them. Crypto has the ability to fluctuate wildly upward, so if you’re good about it and stick to rebalancing it can create alpha within a client portfolio because it’s so noncorrelated.”  True alpha comes not from crypto’s ability to be a high-performing asset class, Eichler said, but from an advisor’s ability to rebalance a portfolio around it to periodically capture and lock in outsize returns.  Eichler said he would need two things to begin handling crypto as a fiduciary on behalf of his clients: A clear analysis of the governance of crypto coins and a robust system for buying and selling of crypto that could appropriately record sales and purchases.  “We know who manages cash: the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. I can see who is governing and what their decisions are,” he said. “I can’t do that with most cryptocurrency. I would actually prefer not to see laws issued on this matter. Does an authority come out and say they’ll be the authority on crypto and make sure these coins aren’t being fragmented and split and watered down, an authority that can give a coin their blessing, which then would make it more valuable? That’s something I’m watching for.”  Read More: How Advisors Can Add Value to Clients With Crypto",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/12/why-one-adviser-is-pumping-the-brakes-on-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdc1236934939e8dccd4983fcec1735ea5bb4682-612x409.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411455,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO4cy,1652359800,Crypto Investing Means Staying Positive Amid Volatility,"Markets have been difficult to watch over the last few weeks across most liquid asset classes, but none so painful as cryptocurrencies.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) has plummeted in the past week, dropping below $27,000, less than half of its November 2021 high. That’s a long way down in a short amount of time. Most of the major alterfnative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) have posted similar performances.  Amid this volatility, the chorus of voices critical of cryptocurrency has become amplified. Most are rehashing arguments that view cryptos as akin to pyramid or Ponzi-like schemes that funnel most value towards a few founders and early investors.  As of this writing, the crescendo has culminated in a sense that crypto might be “dead.”  That’s the case made by The Spectator’s Ross Clark, who argues that despite the lower prices for bitcoin and other tokens, there are few signs that investors are buying the dip en masse. Clark argues that this is the end stage of a pyramid scheme, when there are not enough new investors to create the next layer of the pyramid and the scheme collapses in on itself.  Writers like Clark are pointing out that bitcoin is not really serving as a hedge to inflation or equities, as some expected, and are calling into question cryptocurrencies’ value as investments themselves.  Oh yeah, it doesn’t help that over last weekend, the Justice Department indicted the CEO of Mining Capital Coin, a crypto mining and investment platform, for allegedly running a $62 million pyramid scheme.  Volatility is a feature, not a bug  We talk a lot about the virtues and potential of cryptocurrencies in the crypto press, but clients are going to hear and read about these things, and they’re going to look to advisors to help them stay on track. If advisors believe in cryptocurrency, then they have to be prepared to make the case to clients for staying invested in them for the long term.  Read More: Digital Assets Are More Recession-Proof Than You Might Think  Ultimately, volatility is a feature, not a bug of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the crypto with the longest track record and the most investor participation, has seen this type of precipitous drop several times over its history.  Cryptocurrencies may closely correlate with technology sector stocks at times, but the asset classes have historically converged and decoupled, said David Gamble, portfolio manager at Sarson Funds, a crypto education and investment platform for financial advisors.  Gamble believes that crypto will ultimately decouple from equities as a new wave of adoption emerges, driven by state actors. Two countries, El Salvador and the Central African Republic, have already adopted bitcoin as legal tender, and Gamble expects more to follow.  “That being said, good things take time, and we’ll need to see more of this adoption curve,” he said. “Fundamentally, we are seeing the right things happen.”  Another bright spot is regulation, where there appears to be some movement towards clarity and consensus building in the U.S. towards how crypto will be treated – the president’s executive order kicked off coordinated review of cryptocurrencies and the digital asset ecosystem by federal agencies.  What happens next?  For the time being, regulators appear to be taking a more benign approach in the U.S.  “People were very cautious around what might be to come, especially around the debate of people being able to self-custody,” said Stan Miroshnik, partner and co-founder of 10T holdings, a growth-stage private equity firm focused on the digital assets space. “The recent executive order wasn’t just benign, it was forward-thinking by pushing for a thoughtful framework for regulation.”  Read More: Regulators Should Pay Attention to UST  Progress is being made towards more efficient cryptocurrency products, like a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), to be made available in more marketplaces.  Ultimately, those products will be key in bringing in new crypto investors, said Andrew Puschel, global head of strategy at HashDex, which has created a suite of exchange-traded crypto products, including spot-price ETFs domiciled in Brazil.  “I wouldn’t say the SEC is ready, but they are getting there incrementally,” said Puschel. “There’s been a lot of demand serviced through private placement products, direct ownership and other things, but ultimately from a compliance standpoint advisors and investors want to own an entire portfolio on one platform – all of the assets should be in the same place, and that’s one thing that ETFs can offer.”  And overall, investment in crypto and digital assets is still increasing as businesses develop and offer more ways of accessing the space.  Coinbase (COIN), which recently announced it has reached 89 million verified users, now predicts that there will be 1 billion active cryptocurrency users by 2032. As of 2021, there were estimated to be 295 million users – so there’s still plenty of growth to look forward to within the networks that power crypto.  “It’s clear that crypto has arrived and we can’t afford to ignore crypto any longer,” said Ben Cruikshank, founder of Flourish, a crypto platform for advisors. “Twenty-five percent of American investors are investing in crypto now – that’s the same number that are investing in CDs. It can’t be avoided.”  Read more: Bitcoin Is Down, but You Don't Have to Be",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/12/crypto-investing-means-staying-positive-amid-volatility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afc045c8b0d3fde4225825cf762ecf3576d1b9eb-612x407.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The proposal, which was passed with a 98.8% majority across 11 million votes, suggests imposing a supply cap of 750 million for the CAKE token.  CAKE currently has a circulating supply of 295 million. The maximum supply is expected to be in circulation within the next three to four years.

However, the fall wave was so strong that the price broke the liquidity zone and set a local low of $0.0689. The last time such an aggressive weekly candle was in May 2021 at the beginning of the fall. The worst for DOGE cryptocurrency may be yet to come. It should be understood that the sharp momentum of the fall of 9 May lowered the DOGE price by more than 40%. At the same time, the weekly trading volumes are not high. Buyers do not keep the price and do not put up much resistance in the big timeframe. Therefore, if buyers do not take control of the $0.1 range by the end of May, we will see the DOGE price continue to fall to the next $0.05 target.

Decentralised finance sided with the gaming industry and formed a long-awaited GameFi sector. What came to replace the Play2Earn model and why? Why is the gaming industry shifting towards creating metaverses and at what table retail investors can get a seat? Why is Create2Earn more sustainable than Play2Earn long-term? Let&apos;s dive deeper into the main question: how to get a piece of the phenomenal $218.7 billion pie that is projected to be the gaming industry size by 2024. Play2Earn ups and downs In the gaming industry, the Play-to-Earn (Play2Earn or P2E) model came to replace the classic Pay-to-Play model. It was a revolutionary idea that came with a new tech wave: games stopped being a hobby for teens and became a multi-billion business that can even help people pay their bills. Ideas that came from the DeFi sector (decentralised finance), helped to create entire in-game economies where people could invest and earn by simply playing a game. But most importantly, in contrast with centralised games, all purchased in-game items were made in the form of non-fungible items, hence unique and liquid, even outside the game universe. The brilliance of the idea was immediately proven by the storming success of Axie Infinity which reached a 2.7 million user base by November 2021, just 6 months after its inception.

Some 244,000 anchor (ANC) tokens have been used to place votes on “yes” at writing time. ANC is Anchor Protocol's governance token that users can deposit or stake to create new governance polls, or vote on existing pools started by users that have staked ANC.  Anchor is a savings, lending and borrowing platform built on the Terra platform that allows users to earn yields on UST deposits and take out loans against holdings. Critics have previously touted its “stable high interest rate” – as described on its website – as unsustainable due to the high amounts of money required to maintain those rates.  In the past few months, Anchor continued to operate as intended and became the biggest DeFi application on Terra. But UST’s recent depegging from the dollar has made the protocol’s grandiose plans go awry.  UST fell to as low as 22 cents on Wednesday amid outflows from Anchor and LUNA’s rapid drop, causing a downward spiral. UST has since recovered somewhat but the long-term recovery remains unclear.  “A depegged UST cannot sustain 18% APY any longer,” wrote Anchor contributor Daniel Hong in a relevant forum post. “While some may argue higher interest rates help with less UST circulating supply, when the stablecoin have already lost trust from the public due to a [two]-day depeg people would try to exit anyways.”  “One significant factor for today’s depeg was the release of Terra’s stability reserve into the Anchor reserve every time it was depleted, introducing newly minted UST that was not supposed to be there into circulation,” Hong wrote, explaining UST’s price plunge on Wednesday.  Hong, however, added the “fairly aggressive” change would be rolled back as and when deemed necessary, meaning the 4% interest rate may increase in the future should market conditions improve.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/12/terra-based-defi-protocol-anchor-proposes-cutting-ust-yield-rates-to-4,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd323034a85545cccfc3e76e5ff9a685131daead-1280x941.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

GIC led the Series F; Accel, Blackstone (BX), Dragoneer, Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and others also participated, a press release said. Chainalysis previously raised $100 million in June 2021 at half its current valuation.  With ever more digital asset hacks, scams and ransomware attacks grabbing global headlines, the demand for investigatory crypto tools is exploding, Chainalysis said its various tools monitor $1 trillion worth of transactions every month. It helps governments and private companies in tracking illicit crypto flows across transparent public blockchains.  The hulking software-as-a-service company says its customer base increased 75% to 750 total. Big spenders with $100,000+ accounts are also on the rise (a single premium seat can cost tens of thousands of dollars.)  Read more: Deltec, Chainalysis, Robinhood and More Join Crypto Market Integrity Group  But companies and governments around the world are willing to pay. Chainalysis now has a presence in 70 countries and intends to invest big in regions outside its U.S. base.  “A global expansion is one of the drivers here,” CEO Michael Gronager said in an interview. He said Chainalysis is “continuously doubling down” in Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America – a particular hotbed for growth.  Against all this is a proliferation of “more use cases for crypto” (think: non-fungible tokens and decentralized finance exchanges) that clients need to monitor, label, profile and track. “We are constantly building new products” to keep up, Gronager said.  Its team now weighs in at 700, more than half of whom arrived in the past year. Chainalysis is aggressively hiring C-suite officials from big-name entities across the public policy and market structure worlds.  All this for a company whose short-term fate isn’t quite so shackled to token prices. Criminals will keep doing crimes in up markets or down. And governments and companies will pay to get ahead of them.  Gronager said he’s not worried about this week’s market tumult. It’s during the quiet sideways markets to come that stablecoins, NFTs and layer 2s get built, he said. “There’s a lot of smart things to develop,” he said.  And as they come about, the company will introduce new crypto vectors to profile and track.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/12/chainalysis-raises-170m-at-86b-valuation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d3663c5219edb6d36cf566d16f5db9618d61827-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That's why Web 3 startup Lighthouse has raised a $7 million seed round to build out “the search engine of the open metaverse.”  The round was led by co-led by Accel, BlockTower and Animoca Brands and included participation from White Star Capital, Sparkle Ventures and Gemini Frontier Fund, among others.  The company plans to use the funding to grow its team, targeting this summer for its public launch, according to a press release.  Lighthouse allows users to search through a database of all the active events going on in metaverse games like Decentraland and The Sandbox, while also being able to search for where users themselves are in these virtual worlds.  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse  The company’s vision is in line with conceptions of the metaverse that date back to the summer of 2021, when the metaverse was envisioned more as one large, interoperable landscape rather than pockets of closed ecosystems.  Because much of the data for these ecosystems isn’t publicly available on-chain, the platforms themselves have to partner with Lighthouse to be searchable in its database.  Lighthouse says it’s unsure if every closed metaverse will open itself up to its search engine, but backing by firms like Animoca Brands suggests some projects are already on board.  “The closed ecosystem narrative is something that’s not super aligned with the value of Web 3,” Jonathan Brun, co-founder of Lighthouse, told CoinDesk in an interview. “So far, in every single conversation that we’ve had, we’ve been warmly received by players who see our platform as a tool that can help their ecosystems.”",POSITIVE,없음,MANA | SPONSORED,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/12/lighthouse-raises-7m-to-be-the-search-engine-of-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d263709233a65916dd4e0190af97fe4fd2dff38-3600x2400.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In other words, it cost only about $300 million to drain this pool. - To keep the balance of liquidity in the UST-3Crv Pool, LFG removed another $100 million worth of UST from the pool. - On the evening of May 8, WhaleTrades, a whale alert account on Twitter, began to &apos;ring alarm bells&apos; frantically: there was a tweet of selling millions of dollars&apos; worth of UST every hour. - On the morning of May 10, Jump Trading and LFG may have sensed the problem and stopped selling their Bitcoin holdings to provide support for UST&apos;s peg, letting things drift. As a result, UST plummeted all the way to $0.6. - On May 11, UST seemed to be shorted by Soros-style short sellers, and has plummeted to a minimum of $0.2998 (source: CMC) after rounds of underselling.

42423351,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Yn1h,1652348751,Terra Proposes Token Burn and Increase in Pool Size to Stop UST Dilution,"Terra, the protocol behind the UST algorithmic stablecoin that has lost its dollar peg and is putting pressure on the price of the LUNA token, plans to burn UST and increase the available pool of LUNA.  “The primary obstacle is expelling the bad debt from UST circulation at a clip fast enough for the system to restore the health of on-chain spreads,” said Terra in a tweet.  Algorithmic stablecoins like UST are supposed to be automatically pegged to the price of another currency, such as the U.S. dollar. As explained here, traders can swap LUNA for UST at $1 regardless of the market price because the algorithms in the back end will manage the supply of LUNA, creating enough scarcity to justify the $1.  A token burn refers to taking crypto out of circulation on the blockchain. It can be thought of as a deflationary event, because it would increase the value of the remaining blockchain. For token holders it would be a similar event to a share buyback.  In a proposal put forward to token holders, Terra said that it wants to burn the nearly 1 billion UST (roughly US$690 million) in the community pool while increasing the Base Pool of LUNA available to 100 million, which in turn increases minting capacity to over $1 billion. This will help expedite the outflows of UST from the system, thus pushing it back closer to its peg while pushing down the price of LUNA.  “Currently, the burning of UST is too slow to keep pace with the demand for excess UST to exit the system, which is hindered by the BasePool size,” reads the proposal. “Eliminating a significant chunk of the excess UST supply at once will alleviate much of the peg pressure on UST.”  Some comments on the proposal asked if this happened because of a bug in LUNA’s coding, or if it was also a product of a broader market downturn driven by the decline in bitcoin’s (BTC) price.  Validators of the network are able to vote for this proposal. According to a vote tracker, the Yes side has received 50.47% of the vote while the abstain side has 49.1%; 87.8% of eligible voters have already cast a ballot, and the pass threshold is 50%.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/12/terra-proposes-token-burn-and-increase-in-pool-size-to-stop-ust-dilution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f438a758fb99a45d58c75b71604e4a5e92109790-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The crucial reason behind the LUNA crash is the interlinked relation with the UST stablecoin and the sharp sell-off in the early days of May. The link was such that a decrease in UST value would burn UST and mint more LUNA resulting in a higher supply of native tokens. At the beginning of May 2022, some massive UST withdrawals were conducted. The selling increased the supply and drove the price of UST down. As we mentioned, LUNA was minted, and UST was burned to control the situation. However, the system was limited to a specific amount of UST that could be burned. UST was lowered, and many quit their holdings. UST is a crucial component of Terra&apos;s protocols, resulting in negative consequences for Terra&apos;s native token. Thus, the market price started to drop because of the sale of UST.

The round was led by Tiger Global and also featured digital asset custodian Anchorage Digital, token sale platform Coinlist and Francesco Simoneschi CEO of open banking startup TrueLayer.  BVNK launched last October with the aim of appealing to businesses looking to offer crypto services not currently served well by existing payment and settlement providers.  The London-based firm will use the funds to accelerate its push for regulatory licenses and expand into new markets, such as the U.S.  BVNK currently process $2 billion in annualized payments which it aims to grow to serve cross-border businesses with fast payments and banking in crypto and fiat, hoping to address the fees and slow processing times of legacy infrastructure that could be a barrier to adoption by businesses.

42423361,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2YnNh,1652348367,Terra’s LUNA Has Dropped 99.7% in Under a Week. That’s Good for UST,"Traders of Terra’s LUNA tokens suffered some of their biggest weekly losses in recent months as prices fell 99.7% in a week, data shows.  The LUNA price fell 96% in the past 24 hours alone, pushing it to less than 10 cents. That's down from about $60 earlier this week and a record $120 in mid-April.  A change in market dynamics caused LUNA prices to snap at a breakneck pace. LUNA plummeted through several support levels as terraUSD (UST), a Terra-issued stablecoin that's meant to be priced 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, lost its peg.  The selling pressure on LUNA started over the weekend as investors liquidated their earnings on Anchor, a Terra protocol for earning yields on UST, pushing interest rates lower, analytics suggest.  That's because of how algorithmic stablecoins like UST operate. One UST can be redeemed or minted for exactly $1 worth of LUNA at any time. In theory that helps UST retain its value and creates demand for both tokens.  Traders can continuously buy and sell LUNA and UST to maintain the peg and profit by doing so, incentivizing them to maintain UST’s peg.  This week’s drop in the UST price – it fell to as low as 22 cents Wednesday – caused additional LUNA to be minted and issued into the open market. According to Messari data, LUNA's circulating supply more than tripled to 1.4 billion tokens on Thursday from 377 million two days ago.  The vastly increased supply added selling pressure on LUNA tokens, as the price drop shows. At the same time, it put UST on a path to recovery, with the tokens recovering to the 60 cents level in European morning hours on Thursday.  In addition, Terra proposed several measures on Thursday that would save UST's peg and prevent LUNA from getting severely diluted.  The week's slump in LUNA pushed it out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization to rank 81st this morning. The tokens were valued at just under $4 billion last week, while on Thursday the capitalization snapped down to $720 million.  Still, some market observers remain upbeat on the longer-term outlook of algorithmic stablecoins.  ""It is still the earliest days of algorithmic stablecoins,"" Brian Gallagher, co-founder of Partisia Blockchain, said in a Telegram message. ""There will be many failures along the way to hold the peg, as they're mostly in the experimental phase. We have to accept the failures along the path.”  Possible contagion risks, however, pushed tether (USDT), the biggest stablecoin by market capitalization, to lose its peg with U.S. dollars in European morning hours today.",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/12/terras-luna-has-dropped-997-in-under-a-week-thats-good-for-ust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a604932aa05a827543a02a98c4e9d227ba6c756d-3267x2450.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The theory goes that if you can reward people for getting in shape and staying active, you can help address the global obesity epidemic.

Liquidations in the crypto market happen when a trader has insufficient funds to fund a margin call – or a call for extra collateral demanded by the exchange to keep the trading position funded. They’re especially common in high-risk trading due to the high volatility of assets. It occurs in both margins and futures trading.  Traders of ether futures lost $333 million to liquidations as the asset lost 22% to drop under the $1,900 level. This was the highest among all cryptos, with bitcoin futures seeing $330 million in losses and futures tracking Terra’s LUNA racking up $130 million in losses.  Losses exceeded $1.2 billion in the past 24 hours, the highest so far this year. They came as major cryptocurrencies saw steep drops: Bitcoin (BTC) fell 11%, BNB Chain’s BNB lost 26%, and Solana’s SOL lost 37%. Terra’s LUNA fell out of the top 10 cryptos by market capitalization to the 81st rank – it fell 96% in the past 24 hours to under 40 cents.  Crypto exchange OKX saw $393 million in liquidations, the highest among all crypto exchanges, followed by Binance at $389 million and Bybit at $155 million.  Data shows 83% of all futures were long, or betting on higher prices, despite weakness in the overall market earlier this week. Much of the systemic risk arose from terraUSD (UST), an algorithmic stablecoin issued by Terraform Labs, losing its peg with the U.S. dollar and causing a cascading effect on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms running on Terra.  Contagion associated with UST likely spread over to the broader market alongside inflation fears and weak CPI data, fueling a drop in crypto prices.  Meanwhile, data shows open interest – or the amount of unsettled futures contracts – fell 10% in the past 24 hours, implying traders removed liquidity and exited positions in anticipation of further volatility.",NEGATIVE,LUNA | BNB,EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/12/ether-futures-lead-12b-in-liquidations-crypto-market-cap-drops-16-overnight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5466997a3ddbf3007ff71193a1aa165afe851d3-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Past Performance of GALA The GALA holders who lost the psychological support of $0.10 have released the prolonged selling momentum.

However, the prices plunged after the retest and currently stand below the $0.075 support level. The widening gap between the EMAs that are downsloping indicates rising selling pressure.

However, this does not imply that the price of Bitcoin will continue to fall. What if cryptocurrency prices continue to move in lockstep with stock prices, rather than the other way around?

The blockchain is a &apos;distributed ledger&apos; technology that maintains a permanent record of all transactions between parties. A transaction that has been encrypted and added to a blockchain cannot be changed or removed. As a result, many computers worldwide have copies of the ledger. This increases the trustworthiness and clarity of the ledger transactions. Web 3.0 decentralizes information storage and allows for peer-to-peer transactions. For example, it allows people to program &apos;smart&apos; contracts that can quickly transfer money, rights, and property between people. Smart contracts eliminate the need for many middlemen, such as banks, who facilitate people doing business with one another. As a result, an entire financial system is separate from the current banking system. People and businesses can buy, sell, borrow, lend, and invest without using a bank in this blockchain-based ecosystem. Aside from the rise of smart contracts, Web3 has seen the emergence of a new class of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and tokens that cannot be exchanged for cash (NFTs).
