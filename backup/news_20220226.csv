42375215,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6bq7,1645903804,EU 'Commits' to Cutting Russian Banks Off From SWIFT Over Ukraine Invasion,"The European Union has ""resolved"" to isolate Russia from the international financial system, including by blocking some banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the messaging network underpinning global financial transactions.  In blocking Russia from SWIFT, the European Union would block Russian institutions from conducting any interbank transactions with non-Russian entities, effectively cutting it off from the global financial system. The move came days after Russian military forces launched attacks on various cities and military bases in Ukraine, including in the nation’s capitol Kiev.  Italy, Hungary and Cyprus were initially opposed to the move, but expressed support for it on Friday and Saturday. Meanwhile, Germany is in favor of ""targeted and functional"" restrictions on Russia.  The European Commission formalized this support later Saturday in a public statement attributed to the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, U.K., Canada and U.S.  ""We commit to ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system. This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,"" the statement said.  The EC also committed to blocking the Russian Central Bank from using its international reserves and preventing Russian oligarchs from buying passports in other nations to reenter the global financial system.  Officials in the EC also plan to launch a ""transatlantic task force"" to implement sanctions enacted by the EU, U.S., U.K., Japan, Canada, South Korea and several other groups ""by identifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned individuals and companies that exist within our jurisdictions,"" the statement said.  Further sanctions may be announced as part of this effort.  ""We are working flat out on how to limit the collateral damage of decoupling from SWIFT in such a way that it affects the right people,” Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said in a statement on Saturday, according to Bloomberg. Officials from European nations plan to meet Sunday to begin work on this process.  Given that SWIFT is based in Belgium, support across the European bloc was critical to expel any country, such as Russia.  Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden is considering publicly supporting the decision to remove Russia from SWIFT.  On Friday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said during a press briefing that the administration had not taken a SWIFT ban on Russia off the table.  ""There’ll be ongoing discussions about that. As you know, SWIFT is a messaging service that connects 11,000 banks. And many would argue that there are ways that – that Russia – the Russian leadership could get around that over the course of time, but it certainly remains an option on the table,"" Psaki said.

On Saturday, Ukraine Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov called for information on crypto wallets held by Russian and Belorussian politicians. “War crimes must be pursued and punished!” he said in a tweet.  Artem Afian, a Ukrainian lawyer gathering addresses, according to Fedorov, told CoinDesk the minister’s goal is to “stop Russian politicians from using crypto and avoiding sanctions.” This would become especially important if Russia is kicked from the SWIFT international banking system, he suggested.  The call-to-action adds another layer to Ukraine’s post-invasion crypto strategy, which includes soliciting donations in bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). Both efforts highlight how cryptocurrencies can jump borders as a tool for those seeking assistance as well as people trying to evade the law.  Read more: People Are Sending Millions in Bitcoin to Aid Ukraine's Military as Russia Advances  Russia-linked wallet addresses will be reported to government sanctions offices, to cryptocurrency exchanges and to Chainalysis, the crypto tracing company, Afian said via Telegram. Doing so could make it more difficult for offending addresses to cash out.  A representative for Chainalysis wouldn’t comment on discussions with the Ukrainian government.  “Chainalysis is monitoring for on-chain indicators of crypto-based sanctions evasion by Russian actors,” the company tweeted late Friday. “We will alert our partners in government of any relevant activity and provide public updates where possible. So far, on-chain tx vols across the region are stable.”  Ruble-crypto trading pairs have seen a nearly ninefold surge in daily volume since the days leading up to the invasion, the company said.

Cryptocurrency arbitrage is a method in which traders purchase a cryptocurrency on one exchange and quickly sell that cryptocurrency for a higher price on another exchange. This is where the old Wall Street tactic of &apos;arbitrage&apos; comes into play. &apos;Capturing the arb&apos; refers to profiting from the fact that an asset is selling for a low price in one exchange but a greater price in another. Traders use crypto arbitrage to take advantage of cryptocurrency&apos;s lower price on one exchange by buying and selling it instantly for a higher price on another exchange. Why are the Prices of Cryptocurrencies on Crypto Exchanges so Different? Centralized Exchanges The first thing to understand is that cryptocurrency pricing on centralized exchanges is determined by the order book&apos;s most recent bid-ask matched order. So, the most recent price at which a trader buys or sells a digital asset on an exchange is termed the exchange&apos;s real-time price. For example, if the most recently matched market order on an exchange is to buy bitcoin for $40,000, this price becomes the platform&apos;s newest bitcoin price. The next matching order will determine the cryptocurrency price after that. Therefore, price discovery on exchanges is a constant process of deciding a cryptocur...",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/all-you-should-know-about-cryptocurrency-arbitrage/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

The Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets listed by the government on Twitter have already received around $9.4 million worth of crypto in total. The Ethereum wallet has received just over $5.2 million in donations as of 22:39 UTC. The Bitcoin wallet has received $4.2 million as of the same time, with some of the bitcoin having already been sent out.  The official Twitter accounts of the Ukrainian government and Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov provided wallet addresses for donations of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and the stablecoin tether (USDT).  Funds were initially trickling into the listed addresses over fears the Ukrainian government account had been hacked. While Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed doubt as to the veracity of the appeals, the tweets came from verified accounts. (Buterin later said the accounts were ""legit"" and he'd be deleting his warning.)  Representatives for the Ukrainian government weren't immediately available for comment and the country's official website appeared to be down.  When this article was first published, the wallets contained about $435,000 in crypto but just over an hour later, the Bitcoin wallet contained around $500,000 or 13 BTC, while the Ethereum wallet had around $3.6 million or 1,090 ETH in total. That may not be the total donated, however, as there are indications that some bitcoin has already been removed from the respective wallet.  This is not the first instance of using cryptocurrencies to aid Ukrainians in their battle against the Russian invasion. A digital wallet raising funds to support the Ukrainian army has received almost $6 million in bitcoin.

42375247,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6exr,1645891265,What Stagflation Could Mean for Crypto Markets,"If you thought inflation was the worst thing that could happen economically as the world grapples with a post-pandemic recovery, get ready for stagflation.  The term hasn’t been needed much since the 1970s.  Stagflation describes an economy with higher-than-normal inflation and unemployment rates but little to no economic growth. The last time the U.S. economy entered such a state was in the 1970s, when former President Richard Nixon took the United States off the gold standard.  The term has recently become a hot topic again among economists and analysts, and it’s not something to look forward to. With bitcoin seen by many digital-asset investors as a hedge against inflation, and by others as a risky asset whose price could fall during a lousy economic stretch, the ""S-word"" might soon start creeping into the lexicon of the crypto-markets narrative.  Since 1960, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks has averaged +2.5% per quarter, but during periods of stagflation, it saw a 2.5% decline, Scott Bauer, a former Goldman Sachs trader who's now CEO of Prosper Trading Academy, told CoinDesk.  With the consumer price index rising 7.5% over the past 12 months, the highest inflation since 1982, analysts are already worried, and recent tensions in Eastern Europe make things even more dicey. Oil prices went over $100 a barrel after Russian president Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine, and the possibility of losing access to other Russian commodities has been driving prices for other raw materials as well.  “Stagflation is a reality,” said Bob Iaccino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank. “Because of the positive correlation between crypto and the NASDAQ (it keeps getting tighter and tighter as time goes on) the stagflation playbook could certainly hurt the crypto markets,” he wrote in a note.  He predicts high demand for Treasury bonds, U.S. dollars, gold, consumer staples and real estate, and he's bullish on small-cap stocks – companies with a market capitalization below $2 billion – and tech.  “Bouts of stagflation have historically been associated with declining profit margins, as companies face higher prices and dwindling sales,” said Bauer.  “In periods of stagflation, the demand for defensive assets increases,"" he said.

42393977,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQMwd,1645875900,'Will ETH Survive?': Why Ethereum's Leaders Forked the Network in 2016,"Earlier this week, I revealed in Forbes that, in the course of reporting and writing my book ""The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze,"" my sources and I figured out who we believe the ""DAO attacker"" is.  The reason this was such big news was that the DAO attack had been the biggest, most consequential event in Ethereum’s life. The DAO, short for decentralized autonomous organization, was the first major app on Ethereum to get any traction, and it was structured as a decentralized venture capital fund. The DAO crowdsale was the highest-crowdfunded event in history, raising $139 million, bringing in just shy of 15% of all [ether] at the time. The hacker had siphoned about a third of that locked ETH, giving them significant control over the young network.  A month later, because of the enormity of the hack, and due to the impossibility of other potential solutions, Ethereum ended up hard forking, a contentious decision. Because not everyone agreed with it, the fork – a backwards compatible upgrade – ran the risk of creating a second, competing version of Ethereum. And that is exactly what happened, giving birth to Ethereum Classic.  In this excerpt from my book, taken from the scenes almost immediately after the hack began, we see the exchange operators and the Ethereum team begin to try to address the issue – right as news begins percolating out to the community. Almost immediately, it becomes apparent that the various players had different incentives, which prevented them from aligning on a single course of action – a prescient theme for how the rest of The DAO saga would play out.  CHRISTOPH JENTZSCH DECIDED THAT with God and his wife, he could handle anything. The chief technology officer for Slock.It, the organization that built The DAO, got up from his office floor to notify the Ethereum Foundation and corral Stephan Tual and Griff Green, the company's chief operating officer and community manager, respectively, and megaphones to the world. He, Slock.It CEO Simon Jentzsch and technical engineer Lefteris Karapetsas, tried to figure out how the attack worked and what could be done.  In Shanghai, Vitalik Buterin got a Skype message from an Ethereum community member about the attack at around 3 p.m. local time, about an hour after Green woke up. The community member asked if this could be a hack. Buterin thought, 99% chance it’s totally fine. But then he saw the smart contract's balance was 9 million ETH and change, down from 11.7 million.  See also: The DAO Attack: Understanding What Happened  Meanwhile, at 8:15 a.m. Berlin time, Green posted in the DAOhub forum, “@channel EMERGENCY ALERT! IF YOU HAVE A SPLIT OPEN PLEASE DM A SLOCK.IT MEMBER ASAP!!!” He posted a similar message in the Slack channel.  The responses were not promising:  uh oh  Eventually, [MyEtherWallet founder] Taylor Van Orden explained, “Shhhh. If you have initiated a split and it’s currently open, message @griff. If you don’t know what a split is then don’t worry.”  Meanwhile, Christoph, Simon, Buterin and the others hopped on Skype calls and created a few Skype groups with all the old faces – Karapetsas, Vitalik, Gavin [Wood], Aeron Buchanan, Péter Szilágyi, Christian Reitwießner, Alex Van de Sande, Taylor Gerring, Fabian Vogelsteller and so on. They tried to discern the method of attack to be able to counterattack and recover the coins.  Several of them jumped into a Skype group with exchange operators, where Buterin wrote possible mitigation strategies are:  1. Seizing any stolen ether that goes through exchanges     Buterin was referring to the fact that The DAO attacker had used a split DAO to perform the attack – exploiting the way all withdrawals from the DAO were made. It was as if, had The DAO been a ship, the attacker had launched his or her attack from a lifeboat in the water. If developers trying to fight the attacker could find another lifeboat to enter, they could perform a similar attack so as to drain the funds themselves and keep them away from the attacker. Since it took a week from initiating a split DAO to being able to put tokens in one, they were looking for one either already open or about to open.  An Ethereum communications team member, George Hallam, wrote, “ALL EXCHANGES: please pause ether trading as soon as possible.”  This was a serious measure. It would stop the attacker from being able to cash out his or her stolen ETH but punish ETH traders who wanted to sell, costing them the ability to take profits before the ETH price dropped based on the news. But Dino Mark, an Ethereum insider, posted, “The ethereum foundation can reimburse exchange losses. Without a hard fork and rollback this damage will be permanent and the ecosystem will die.”  The mention of a rollback put the exchange operators on alert.  A rollback was like an undo – reneging on the inviolable blockchain principle of immutability. This principle made a blockchain different from any old database. Bitcoin, the blockchain with which many people were most familiar, was a time-stamped ledger chained to earlier versions of itself by cryptography. It was impossible to change a past transaction without breaking the mathematical link between older versions of the ledger and more recent ones.  But Mark defended himself: “This happened with Bitcoin in 2013. Exchanges rolled back trades.” (He was referring to an incident in 2013, when an upgraded version of the Bitcoin software was incompatible with the previous version, causing the chain to fork in two.  To resolve the issue, developers decided to support the older version, the path of least resistance; they had to contact exchanges, mining operators, merchants and other large Bitcoin operators to resolve it.)  Mark had also mentioned another term, “hard fork,” that could be innocuous or controversial, depending on the circumstances.  See also: Did Ethereum Learn Anything From the $55M DAO Attack? | Opinion  A hard fork was an upgrade to the software that was not backward compatible. This meant that if a significant portion of the miners and other nodes on the network chose not to upgrade to it, the Ethereum chain would split in two, creating a new chain that shared a history up to a point before it branched off, creating a second ether currency. Although Ethereum used hard forks to add features to the network, these were system-wide upgrades that faced no opposition from the community and were as carefully planned and publicized as space launches. However, a hard fork to bail out only The DAO token holders would likely not have the support of the entire Ethereum community, such as, among others, the exchanges that sold ETH – and that could create a competing Ethereum blockchain with its own currency. And the attack was on The DAO, not on Ethereum. If Ethereum hard-forked because of the DAO attack, it would be like Apple doing something potentially harmful to itself because of an attack on its most popular app.  In that scenario, some portion of the other apps and users would likely refuse to go along. But with Ethereum, there was no CEO who would decide; the community, as a group, would have to. Someone else cautioned everyone, keep the big picture in mind: What we are facing is a crappy smart contract and careless investors. This is their risk of investing without proper due diligence. Don’t risk the reputation of Ethereum as an independent, decentralized platform because of it by taking hasty measures like hard forks or roll backs. Doing so will create a highly dangerous precedent, giving political authorities an entry whenever required in the future!  As another executive, Philip G. Potter, at the exchange Bitfinex put it, this is problem with DAO not ETH.  Mark insisted Bitcoin’s 2013 rollback was precedent. Phil asked, “[I]f you screw exchanges, will ETH survive?” Mark said yes and asked the exchanges yet again to freeze trading. Phil wrote, “f**k this coin.”  Mark insisted Ethereum would not recover if the DAO theft was allowed to happen and the hacker sold millions of ETH on exchanges. “The price will be $0.50,” he wrote. “Think logically. Irrecoverable PR disaster.”  But as Tristan D’Agosta of Poloniex pointed out, “It is much more likely to cause market panic if the blockchain is considered unreliable.”  In addition, as Phil wrote, “if any government entity realizes that they can potentially pressure a ‘leaderless’ DAO (or ETH for that matter) into a rollback, the consequences will be far reaching, I promise you.”  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | FORKS,Laura Shin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/26/how-ethereums-leaders-immediately-responded-to-the-dao-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d684fc06e73dc7d3ccce20670df314510cbf5d6-2048x1083.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The listing is a huge milestone for the project given that South Korea possesses some of the strictest crypto listing regulations worldwide. The process involves in-depth reporting and high-level scrutiny from local financial watchdogs, all of which LABEL Foundation has successfully passed to be listed on Coinone. Crypto exchanges like Coinone are among the few left after the market shutdown that saw most crypto exchanges in the region shutter their doors due to the inability to comply with strict regulations. One reason for this is that cryptocurrencies are still not regarded as legal money in the country, and although crypto exchanges are legal, they have to operate under strict guidelines, and crypto projects are not exempt from these regulations. After proving compliant with these regulations, LABEL Foundation recently received approval to be listed on the crypto exchange with a listing spot with the KRW (South Korean currency). This comes on the heels of Clesson, its parent company, raising $2 million in equity funding to put the project at the forefront of Web 3.0 content creation.
