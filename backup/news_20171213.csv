42400792,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKh1n,1513206044,2018's Big Question: Can Bitcoin Forks Deliver Value?,"Elly Zhang is a London-based global marketing professional who leads Asia growth initiatives for bitcoin and ether wallet startup Blockchain.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      This year has been pivotal for digital assets like bitcoin and ether, resulting in unprecedented price increases, capital investment and general awareness.  But despite these successes, one of the fundamental properties of all cryptocurrencies – their decentralized nature – has been under attack in 2017.  With this in mind, it's worth remembering that a core value proposition of blockchains is that there is no one central intermediary or organization that controls them. Instead, these protocols are used to enable the network to come to a consensus on the validity of transactions and data.  Bitcoin was the first digital payment system to function without a central repository, and the concept (fairly novel in 2009) is now widely accepted and becoming more ubiquitous. But the world's first blockchain has evolved since its humble beginnings, and today there are variations on the original – most notably, bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold.  Forks have become so prevalent one might call the model an initial fork offering (IFO).  Not just bitcoin gold and bitcoin cash, but more bitcoin variations initiated by Chinese companies such as ""super bitcoin,"" ""bitcoin diamond"" and ""bitcoin god"" are on the way.  And while all may be finding a market, it's worth asking the question, are these networks delivering on the promise of the technology? And should consumers care?  Framing the question  An argument can be made that the three cryptocurrency networks are all different in how well they encapsulate the vision of bitcoin as a decentralized network.  But it's worth noting, too, that decentralization is frequently achieved by market economics.  When thinking about this, I'm reminded of the classic question asked by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988:  ""I haven’t seen a single bread queue. Please take me to meet the person in charge of supplying bread to London. I must learn his secret.""  In fact, there was no one in charge for supplying bread to the city of London, that's why there were no queues.  Though bitcoin was the first so-called ""decentralized"" product built on blockchain technology, there are arguments within the community as to whether it constitutes real ""decentralization.""  There are those who argue that the power and influence of the mining industry results in the network being more centralized than most people expected. To support this point of view, it's valuable to revisit Satoshi Nakamoto's email regarding the original design of bitcoin.  He writes:    ""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12 KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.      The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.    That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices. If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.”    This email makes clear that Satoshi Nakamoto predicted that running network nodes would become the responsibility of a few mining pools or ""specialists"" rather than individual users.  What's less clear is what he would have made of the results of his plan.  The bitcoin cash problem  So far, it seems Satoshi's original scaling proposal actually increases the power mining pools have in deciding the future of the network.  We saw an example of that firsthand when China's developers and miners tried to come up with a new solution to perceived network congestion – forking off to create bitcoin cash.  Bitcoin cash is essentially a blockchain asset created using a software implementation called Bitcoin ABC. The software excluded a somewhat controversial code change called SegWit and has a block size of 8 MB, up from 1 MB on bitcoin. The new rules created a new network.  Now, there is still some ongoing disagreement among the community as to whether bitcoin cash constitutes a hard fork of bitcoin or should be considered a separate ""altcoin,"" but we'll save that for another time.  Relevant for this conversation is the fact that 70% of bitcoin's mining power belongs to China's miners, and the fact is that these entities can easily join forces. Bitcoin Cash, I believe, is a prime example of that.  Thanks to the support of BTC.com, BTC.Top, ViaBTC, AntPool (all of which have direct or dubious connections to Bitmain), it can be argued that bitcoin cash became a centralized commercial product controlled by China's miners.  Weak links in bitcoin gold  With the increasing price of bitcoin cash as a backdrop, others followed the model.  Another fork of bitcoin took place this fall, bitcoin gold, which sought to incorporate technology used by other cryptocurrenices designed to block factors that led to more centralized mining.  Less is known about bitcoin gold, but according to its website:  ""Bitcoin gold decentralizes mining by adopting a PoW algorithm, Equihash, which cannot be run faster on the specialty equipment used for bitcoin mining (ASIC miners). This gives ordinary users a fair opportunity to mine with ubiquitous GPUs.""  Efforts are underway already to create FPGA chip miner for zcash, though, and with progress here, it might only be a matter of time before they develop an ASIC chip. If that's the case, then mining might again shift away from users back to traditional mining pools.  To this possibility, we might ask, what was the point of the fork to begin with?  One possible reason: since initial coin offerings (ICOs) are banned by the Chinese government, there is an appetite by Chinese-based crypto companies to develop new business models.  Open questions  Entering 2018, I believe it's important that we answer key questions about this trend.  These include whether forks of bitcoin might actually be weaker in providing consumers with decentralization, whether buyers want access to those properties or if ""decentralization"" is simply a buzzword and marketing ploy for all cryptocurrencies.  Ultimately, time will tell whether bitcoin, bitcoin cash, or bitcoin gold becomes the most prevalent, but the great thing about an open market is that users get to decide what has the best value or utility.  If the groups behind the scenes can’t offer more value than competitors, then their asset will struggle to survive.  That said, I don't expect to ever see full consensus across any of these crypto assets. As prices continue to rise, I suspect more external powers, whether they’re government, institutional or within the bitcoin community, to try and exert their influence and power.  When the time comes, we may be thankful that we took the time to understand how to fulfill Satoshi's vision in the way he wanted it to be, if not exactly how he expected it to be done.

Regional news sources such as The National and Gulf Digital News report that Mubarak Rashid al-Mansouri, the UAE central bank's governor, unveiled the initiative at a meeting of the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF). Though a press release tied to the Dec. 13-14 meeting does not directly relate to cryptocurrency, it does reference that financial technology topics more generally will be up for discussion among the group of central bankers and financial regulators.  According to GDN, al-Mansouri praised the effort as a first for the region.  ""This is the first times[sic] the monetary authorities of two countries cooperation to use blockchain technology,"" he said.  As quoted by The National, al-Mansouri described the project as a ""digitisation of what we do already between central banks and banks.""  The involvement of Saudi Arabia's central bank is notable, given that the institution to date has not commented on the tech or indicated that it was looking into potential use cases.  By contrast, the UAE is home to a number of private and public sector-driven initiatives, including Dubai's Global Blockchain Council.

42400774,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKgm3,1513198853,Fed Chair Yellen: Bitcoin Is a 'Highly Speculative Asset',"Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen called bitcoin a ""highly speculative asset"" that isn't subject to regulation by the U.S. central bank during her final press conference today.  Yellen, whose term in office expires in February, spoke to reporters today on a range of topics. About thirty minutes into the presser, Yellen was asked about bitcoin.  She noted that, in the Fed's view, bitcoin ""plays a very small role"" in the U.S. payment system, going on to explain:  ""It is not a stable store of value and it doesn't constitute legal tender. It is a highly speculative asset and the Fed doesn't really play any role, any regulatory role with respect to bitcoin other than assuring that banking organizations that we do supervise are attentive that they're appropriately managing any interactions they have with participants in that market, and appropriately monitoring anti-money laundering [and] Bank Secrecy Act responsibilities that they have.""  Yellen went on to answer a follow-up question on directives for banks regarding bitcoin. She answered by saying that, to date, the Fed has not issued any specific missives to banks on the subject.  Her comments didn't represent much of a departure from past statements – she told Congress in 2014 that the Fed wouldn't move to regulate bitcoin activity, while also calling blockchain an ""important technology"" earlier this year.  Indeed, compared to central banks like those in countries like China, the Fed has largely maintained a hands-off approach to the cryptocurrency, focusing primarily on research.  And perhaps disappointingly for some observers in the bitcoin community, there were no ""buy bitcoin"" signs on display during Yellen's appearance today.

42400786,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKguu,1513196146,South Korean Officials Weigh New Curbs on Bitcoin Trading,"The South Korean government is considering a range of policy options in order to curb what it called an ""overheating of virtual currency speculation,"" including a possible capital gains tax on trades.  In a Dec. 13 statement published by the Office for Government Policy Coordination, officials from the Ministry of Justice, Financial Services Commission, Korea Communications Commission, Fair Trade Commission, and Ministry of Information and Communication laid out possible policy approaches – subject to legislative approval – for the country's booming cryptocurrency market. Reuters first reported the developments.  The move is perhaps unsurprising, given the significant trading activity out of Korea – Bithumb is one of the world's largest by trade volume on a given day – and exchanges there were the first to see bitcoin's price cross the $10,000 line late last month.  Options particularly relevant for traders include a potential capital gains tax imposition and a ban on foreign traders. That taxation question is an open one, and statement suggests that that private-sector input will be solicited and that approaches in use by other governments – the U.S. Internal Revenue Service taxes bitcoin as a form of property, for example – are up for consideration as well.  South Korea's cryptocurrency exchanges will also be subject to cybersecurity checks – particularly in the area of data theft and loss – if the measures are approved. Further, exchanges that see more than 10 billion won in daily trading (worth roughly $9.2 million at press time) and in excess of 1 million daily users would be required to obtain approval from the Korea Information Security Agency.  The government is also considering whether to impose a formal ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs), a move that would cement a prohibition on the blockchain funding model put in place by the Financial Services Commission this fall. The statement also suggested that measures against multi-level marketing schemes that involve digital currencies may also be included.  Additional measures up for discussion include a crackdown on the illegal use of industrial space for bitcoin mining and a ban on exchange accounts for minors, according to the release.  That said, officials noted near the conclusion of the statement that the government doesn't want to create barriers to developments around blockchain, even as it moves to curb exchange activity.  ""In addition, we will continue to rectify the side effects of virtual currency speculation, but we will make balanced policy efforts to ensure that government measures do not hinder the development of technology such as block chains,"" the government said, according to a translation.

Louis Meza, the DA's office said yesterday, is being charged with grand larceny, kidnapping, robbery and criminal use of a firearm in connection with the Nov. 4 of an unnamed victim in New York. The charges were filed in the New York State Supreme Court.  Prosecutors allege that Meza met with the victim, knowing they possessed the ether holdings and arranged to a car service for them after that meeting. According to the indictment, an as-yet-named individual connected to the crime was hiding in the vehicle, at which point they ""demanded that the victim turn over his cell phone, wallet, and keys while holding the victim at gunpoint.""  From there, Meza allegedly went to the victim's apartment where they stole the ethers, according to the DA's office.  The office explained yesterday:  ""Video surveillance later obtained from the victim's apartment building showed MEZA using the set of keys stolen from the victim to enter the victim’s apartment and then leave the apartment holding a box believed to contain the victim’s digital wallet. Additional records reveal that soon after obtaining the victim's digital wallet, the defendant then transferred approximately $1.8 million in Ether to his own personal account.""  On top of the kidnapping and robbery charges, Meza was also charged with criminal possession of stolen property, computer tampering and computer trespass.  In statements, District Attorney Cyrus Vance speculated that additional crimes of this nature could occur in the future, citing growing prices in the cryptocurrency market.  ""We can expect this type of crime to become increasingly common as cryptocurrency values surge upward,"" said Vance.

42400779,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKgqy,1513188009,Kickstarter ICO? Don't Count On It Says Crowdfunding Leader,"The company most widely associated with crowdfunding, Brooklyn-based Kickstarter, has no plans to get into the initial coin offering (ICO) business.  Coming in response to the news yesterday that competitor Indiegogo would facilitate ICOs on its platform, supporting entrepreneurial efforts in this new area of fundraising, a Kickstarter spokesperson told CoinDesk that the firm isn't looking to follow this lead.  ""The answer is 100 percent a very firm no,"" a company spokesperson said.  Since launching in 2009, Kickstarter has been used to successfully distribute $3.04 billion to creative projects, according to its self-reported statistics. It first crossed the billion-dollar mark in 2014. Total ICO funding so far is at $3.8 billion, according to CoinDesk's ICO tracker.  Kickstarter offered few details as to the reasoning for the decision, ultimately directing CoinDesk to its charter, which has five planks.  The first reads, ""Kickstarter's mission is to help bring creative projects to life"" and the fourth says, ""Kickstarter is committed to the arts."" In 2015, the company insulated itself from pressure to make profits its sole priority by reincorporating as a public benefit corporation (PBC).  PBCs are a relatively new legal entity that protects companies that want to pursue a social mission as well as fulfilling their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. We previously reported on Blockstack, which also reincorporated as a PBC.  In this way, shareholders in Kickstarter earn an income stream rather than hoping for a giant return on a big exit down the road. (The company has long committed to remaining private, and one of its three co-founders has compared a share in the company to owning the rights to a popular song.)  But despite any similarities, the company said this unique structure protects it from the temptation to leverage its brand for returns in the frothy ICO market.  ""Not something we looked into or will look into,"" the spokesperson said.

The joint venture between Overstock subsidiary Medici Ventures and Hernando de Soto, named De Soto, Inc., will focus on creating a system for local property records, which will leverage the tech as a way to transfer rights while also incorporating mobile tech and social media elements.  Byrne told the Financial Times that the plan is to launch a pilot system in early 2018, adding that he feels he has ""a great moral obligation to refocus my life around this.""  To that end, Byrne indicated that one funding option would be to sell Overstock, either in segments or in its entirety, and use the money as capital for the new venture.  ""One of the possibilities is I sell the business and we have all the capital we need,"" he said.  According to the FT, advisory firm Guggenheim Partners has been hired to help explore potential options for the sale.  One of the first major online retailers to start accepting bitcoin payments for products, Overstock has since been a notable mover in the blockchain space. The firm began moving several years ago to build its blockchain-powered securities exchange, which it used last year in part to raise $30 million in new funding.  In statements, de Soto positioned the technology behind the new venture as a means to help alleviate poverty. As reported last year, De Soto is also involved in a land registry project involving BitFury and the Georgian government.

42400789,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKgws,1513177208,Here Come the Bogus Bitcoin Scare Tactics,"Steven Hopkins is chief operating officer and general counsel of Medici Ventures, an Overstock.com subsidiary focused on the advancement of blockchain technology.    ""Cynicism masquerades as wisdom, but it is the farthest thing from it.""  – Stephen Colbert    The run-up in bitcoin and other crypto assets has offered cynics of all stripes a chance to look smart by condemning cryptocurrency as a ""Ponzi scheme"" that could ""cause a recession.”  These arguments are not new, but they are ignorant.  It is time that we stop allowing people who do not understand (or simply ignore) the truth to comment on this market as if they know something us greater fools simply cannot see.  Ponzi scheme  People who don’t like bitcoin try to call it a Ponzi scheme or a fraud because then they no longer have to discuss its merits. Jamie Dimon does this.  This week, Bert Ely did it too. His opinion piece in The Hill is subtly titled, ""Bitcoin is a Ponzi Scheme and Will Collapse like One.""  Unfortunately, these same people have never looked up the definition of ""Ponzi scheme"" or ""fraud"" because, even if bitcoin will fail or result in investors losing all their money, it does not meet the definition of either a Ponzi scheme or a fraud.  Ely's big claim is that bitcoin ""will stay afloat only as long as enough people buy the fiction that bitcoin represents real value."" He neglects to say how this is any different than the U.S. dollar or the Venezuelan Bolivar. His central thesis relies on the basic premise of ANY medium of exchange: it only works as long as people will accept it for goods and services.  Even if we let Ely simply change the definition of a Ponzi scheme to fit his argument or ignore the fact that we can buy things like sheets, toasters and tennis shoes with bitcoin, he is simply defining ALL currencies. Nobody accepts dollars because they like green-colored paper, and the idea that government or an army can compel confidence in currency is utterly naïve.  It is also proven false by the Venezuelan bolivar, the German mark and the Zimbabwean dollar. Once we realize this, it is fun to read the rest of Ely's article.  For example, let's edit a passage from Ely to fit the analysis above:  ""All Ponzi schemes eventually collapse, of course, when sufficient amounts can no longer be raised from new investors to pay off earlier investors. The same will occur with [the U.S. dollar and the Venezuelan bolivar]. …. Investors will pull back from buying [dollars and bolivars] causing their prices to begin a sustained decline. This overdue disaster will occur because all [U.S. dollars and Venezuelan bolivars] have no intrinsic value.""  At this point, I considered adding a BTC/USD price chart over the past couple of years to demonstrate the truth of Ely's statement (as edited).  However, I nixed that in favor of my second favorite passage: Ely's conclusion (also edited) where he promises that ""[U.S. Dollars and Venezuelan Bolivars] and the like will quickly fade into financial history, just as tulipmania [and the German mark, the Argentinian peso and the Zimbabwean dollar] did, serving solely to remind future generations of the folly of gambling on illusions of value [like fiat currency].""  I am sure that Ely will say I took his argument out of context and I definitely added a lot of commentary in the passages above, but if his baseline premise is really that bitcoin has no intrinsic value, this is exactly what he is saying about dollars, bolivars and every other fiat currency.  Contagion and market collapse  The new argument from the financial establishment this week comes from the start of trading bitcoin futures at the Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE).  It goes something like this: ""We have to care about this crazy bitcoin bubble because, now that futures are trading, a price collapse could trigger a recession.""  In his piece for Business Insider thoughtfully titled “Now There is A Way for Contagion from a Bitcoin Price Collapse to Flow into the Rest of the Markets,” Jim Edwards argues that “An asset’s value comes from the fact that its market is liquid.”  This is smarter than Ely's ""no intrinsic value"" argument, but then Edwards stops taking us seriously and notes with alarm that a pub in London and gaming company Steam will no longer accept bitcoin as payment. He goes on to extrapolate from those facts that bitcoin might lose its liquidity and become an asset bubble that could burst.  Now he is beginning to sound more like Ely.  Edwards does not mention that Overstock.com (which owns my company, Medici Ventures) has seen the variety and amount of its bitcoin sales more than double over the past year or that payment processing companies like Bitt, Square and Spera are actively working to allow customers to pay for virtually anything at any merchant in bitcoin without any requirement from the merchant to receive or hold cryptocurrencies.  That kind of liquidity is nearly as good as the liquidity of dollars. In the case of international payments, it may be better.  Edwards also conveniently ignores the incredible variety of crypto assets that any bitcoin holder can purchase on cryptocurrency exchanges. His final point that the bitcoin market has never been tested by futures trading is also true but does not mention the most important aspect of bitcoin futures: There is no direct link between the bitcoin market and the futures market, which is cash-settled.  It is ironic that speculative bets denominated in dollars that will never, ever be settled in bitcoin are now the reason that we must be concerned about the price of bitcoin.  There will never be a short squeeze. There will never be failures to deliver on short sales. This is not even a real futures market as we know it, because no contract will ever be fulfilled or settled in the actual currency/commodity that is subject to the contract.  So, the danger isn't bitcoin itself or any of the people who use bitcoin. It is the speculators on Wall Street making enormous long and short bets on what will happen to the bitcoin price.  Instead of worrying about how dangerous bitcoin is for the economy, perhaps we should be asking why we want to let Wall Street bet billions every day on whether bitcoin’s price will go up or down and how much they will try to manipulate the bitcoin market to make sure they win in futures trading.  If there is a systemic risk, it is in the derivatives market, not bitcoin.

42400801,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKh3l,1513173608,Bitcoin Price Dilemma: Bull and Bear Paths in Play,"Fresh off all-time highs, bitcoin is trading sideways and showing signs of bull exhaustion.  As per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at roughly $16,850. But despite the high price, according to data source CoinMarketCap, BTC has only gained a meager 0.70 percent in value in the last 24 hours, a slight move that contrasts with a stellar performance for alternative currencies.  For example, XRP, the cryptocurrency that powers the Ripple network, is up 67 percent on the day, while ether is up 25 percent and looking higher.  As noted yesterday, the stellar performance of ether, litecoin and other alternative currencies could attract new buyers, thus capping the upside in BTC. Also, comments on social media indicate investors are expecting sideways action followed by a drop after the bitcoin futures listing by the CME Group this Sunday.  As such, the price chart analysis indicates the move to $20,000 could take more time than previously thought.  4-hour chart  View  The bearish doji reversal and the breach of the ascending trend line have neutralized the immediate outlook.  Bullish scenario: A move above $18,149 (yesterday's high) would negate the bearish doji reversal and open doors for a rally to $19,697 (Dec. 7 high) and $20,000 (bull flag breakout target).  Note that the bigger rising trend line is still intact. Further, the relative strength index on the 4-hour chart indicates a potential for another leg higher in BTC. So the upside is still in play and a break above $18,149 would reinforce the bullish view.  Bearish scenario: A break below $16,750 (doji candle low) would add credence to the breach of the ascending trend line and the doji reversal. In such a case, BTC could test support at 15,400 (confluence of upward sloping 50-MA and rising trend line).  On a larger scheme of things, only a daily close (as per UTC) below $14,000 would abort the bullish view.

42400793,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKh2m,1513170915,Uncle Sam's Surprise: Tax Reform to Impact Crypto Investors,"The U.S. tax code is on the brink of its largest overhaul in three decades.  And while neither the House of Representatives or Senate version of the tax bill (both have passed in their respective chambers and are in the process of being reconciled into a final bill) specifically addresses cryptocurrency, several rule changes could potentially catch bitcoin holders who realized eye-popping gains in 2017 by surprise.  So far, both versions scrap the ""like-kind"" exchange mechanism that many cryptocurrency holders have used in the past and the Senate version proposes a ""first-in, first-out"" (FIFO) accounting framework, which could complicate cryptocurrency token reporting.  Yet, the proponents of the reform, including President Donald Trump and the majority of Republicans on Capitol Hill, argue the goal is to make paying Uncle Sam far less torturous of a process for everyone.  Representative David Schweikert, the Arizona Republican who serves as the co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus and the Ways and Means Committee, which oversees taxation, told CoinDesk:  ""With a more simplified tax code, individuals will be able to navigate the challenges that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies face with more ease.""  Unfortunately for crypto-holders, the Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act – of which Rep. Schweikert is a co-sponsor – was left out of both versions. Neither version modifies existing capital gains tax rates, which cryptocurrency is subject to pursuant to the IRS' 2014 guidance.  Swapping crypto  Yet, the final bill will almost certainly do away with a crypto-friendly maneuver – deferring capital gains taxes on property by swapping one asset for a similar asset via a so-called 1031 like-kind exchange.  Employing such exchanges has been a common tactic in crypto trading circles in years past, but both the House and Senate bills limit this provision solely to real estate transactions.  ""A lot of people have been taking the position that when they swap tokens from one type of token to another type of token or one cryptocurrency to another cryptocurrency, that’s a like-kind exchange,"" said Lisa Zarlenga, partner at Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, D.C. and co-chair of the firm's tax group.  By swapping between cryptos, asset owners forego the short-term capital gains tax – the same as ordinary income tax rates – and then pay a lower long-term capital gains tax rate of 20 percent when the asset is sold.  According to Kelsey Lemaster, partner at Goodwin Procter in San Francisco, while current law is unclear whether this like-kind mechanism can be applied to cryptocurrencies, a good argument could be made for it in the case of swaps of assets that originate from the same blockchain, such as bitcoin to bitcoin cash.  ""But then if the proposals go through, they would eliminate the ability to take this position on any exchange of crypto,"" Lemaster said.  First in, first out  What is more of a wild card, though, the FIFO accounting mechanism for ""specified securities"" could have the biggest potential impact on cryptocurrency holders.  The requirement, only a provision within the Senate version, means that, as it relates to determining the cost basis of an asset sold, the oldest goods in one's inventory would be the first to be sold.  ""Normally, what you would do is tell your broker to sell the highest-cost ones first. What [the Senate] is proposing is that you can’t use that anymore, that you have to use first-in, first-out,"" said Jim Calvin, tax partner at Deloitte, explaining:  ""So, the first stuff that you bought would have to be the first stuff that you were treated as selling.""  As an example, if a person bought one bitcoin at $1,000 in 2013 and another at $10,000 last month, and then decides to sell one at $15,000, that individual must sell the one bought first – the $1,000 one – and realize $14,000 worth of taxable gains (what they'd likely rather do is sell the $10,000 one first, and realize only $5,000 of taxable gains).  While the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has categorized bitcoin a commodity, many wonder whether this provision, since it only applies to securities, would affect bitcoin. According to Calvin, bitcoin will likely get caught up in this, because bitcoin futures started trading this week.  And even if bitcoin gets a pass, Zarlenga contends several initial coin offering (ICO) issuers, who have designed their tokens as securities, plus the issuers the SEC continues to go after, will fall under the FIFO umbrella.  ""You can have tokens that have enough qualities of a security to be treated as a security for tax purposes,"" she said.  Silver lining  As daunting as FIFO may be, though, it’s not certain that the provision will be in the final bill signed into law.  Since the House and Senate are currently reconciling their respective drafts, and FIFO was only in the Senate's version, it could very well be axed. Especially since many powerful interests, such as the Investment Company Institute – which represents firms in the regulated funds business – are calling for its removal.  Yet, even if it does stay on the bill, there's some good news on the FIFO front, according to Deloitte's Calvin.  For one, the provision only applies account-by-account, meaning that if the oldest bitcoins an individual owns are stored in a separate account from the bitcoins they want to sell or better yet, outside of an exchange account altogether, the rule does not apply.  ""If you sell bitcoin (in 2018), you’re going to be treated as selling the first one that you bought,"" Calvin said. ""So, take it off the exchange, hold it directly and when you want to sell one, you can deliver the one you want to sell.""  Practicing what he preaches, Calvin added, that he personally is taking all his crypto off of exchanges before the end of the year.  Going a step further, Lemaster said traders may want to consider selling off a significant chunk of their crypto holdings before the end of the year to minimize the capital gains realized.  He concluded:  ""If people are planning to sell bitcoins in the near future, it might be worthwhile for them to sell before the beginning of the year.""

42400795,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKh4k,1513169127,$750: The Ether Price Freight Train Has a New Target,"The price of ether, ethereum's native token, hit a new all-time high of $686 today, and the price chart analysis suggests the rally could continue.  At the time of writing, ether (ETH) was trading around $680. As per CoinMarketCap, the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has appreciated by 24.6 percent in the last 24 hours.  Having scaled $400 on Nov. 23, ETH spent a better part of the last three-weeks trading sideways in the $400–$480 range.  The congestion ended with an upside break on Monday amid news that Swiss banking giant UBS, along with other banking industry heavyweights, are planning to use the ethereum network as a means of complying with new regulations scheduled to go live in the EU on Jan. 3.  Ethreum's smart contract capabilities and the decentralized nature could bring down the costs associated with data reconciliation and storage, the firms told CoinDesk.  Whether news driven or not, ETH has rallied 50 percent in the last 48 hours on the back of strong volumes. Twenty-four-hour volume has moved closer to $5 billion, while ether's market capitalization currently stands at $63.71 billion.  That said, there is still plenty of steam left in the bullish move, indicates the price chart analysis.  1-hour chart  The above chart shows that, despite the bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence, ether managed to defend support at $632.31 (161.8 percent Fibonacci extension).  Further, it has witnessed a solid rebound to near $690 levels. The move points to strong ""buy the dip"" mentality in the markets.  Weekly chart  The above chart shows a bullish symmetrical triangle breakout; the upside break witnessed in November signaled the continuation of the rally from December 2016 lows below $6.00 levels.  As per the measured height method, the bullish break in November opened doors for a rally to $730 levels.  View  Ether looks set to challenge resistance at $730 levels and could extend gains to $752 levels (261.8 percent Fibonacci extension level). The RSI shows overbought conditions, however, hence higher peaks may be transitory.  On the downside, $632 (161.8 percent Fibonacci extension) is likely to act as a strong support.

42400785,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKgvt,1513158338,Vanguard Taps Symbiont's Private Blockchain for Index Fund Data,"Vanguard, the mutual fund giant, will begin using smart contract technology developed by blockchain startup Symbiont in some of its actual business processes starting early next year.  For the last few months, the companies have been testing the technology to simplify the way Vanguard takes in data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. This information is used to determine the composition of certain index funds managed by Vanguard, and includes things like company names, share counts, index weighting and corporate actions such as mergers or stock splits.  The three partners found the private blockchain speeds up delivery of the data from CRSP to Vanguard, removes the need for manual intervention and lowers risk. The project will go into full production in early 2018, the companies said Tuesday.  Warren Pennington, a principal in Vanguard's Investment Management Group said in a release:  ""Using this platform, investment managers will be able to instantly distribute, receive, and process index data, resulting in better benchmark tracking and significant cost savings that potentially results in better returns for our clients.""  The partnership will involve 17 index funds totaling $1.15 trillion in assets, including Vanguard's largest, the $650 billion Total Stock Market Index fund. To be sure, that's just a portion of Vanguard's business; it manages 186 index products, with $3.56 trillion in assets, as part of a total 376 funds containing $4.8 trillion.  Still, it's a noticeable advance for enterprise applications of blockchain technology at a time when most of the industry spotlight has been on the boom in cryptocurrencies and token sales.  The news follows last week's decision by the Australian Securities Exchange to replace its clearing and settlement system with a distributed ledger alternative from startup Digital Asset following years of deliberations.

42428264,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6pNh,1513155617,Bitcoin Has Gone Mainstream. That's a Very Big Deal,"Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  Last week, my eighth-grader came home saying that all the boys at school were talking about bitcoin.  Some might describe this vignette, and many others like it from the past few weeks, as a 2017 version of that ominous 1929 moment when shoeshine boys started giving stock tips. But whether or not they signal the bursting of a bubble, these stories also mean something far more important: bitcoin has gone mainstream.  I'm not talking about the long-awaited mass adoption point in which a critical mass of users owns, earns and spends bitcoin. We're still a long way from that notion of ""mainstream.""  Rather, it's a moment of global awareness and dialogue. Even without user adoption, it opens up an immeasurably large array of possibilities, both positive and negative.  As crypto-asset prices have gone haywire this past month, the whole world has started talking about bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology – around dinner tables, at holiday parties, in boardrooms, at trade conferences, in government meetings.  At this stage, it's not a sophisticated conversation. Knowledge and understanding are still seriously lacking. But people are gripped with curiosity, and that's no small matter.  This human conversation can't be separated, either, from the widening engagement of institutions, big and small. Business news shows and websites are now running the BTC ticker on their home screens alongside the Dow Jones Industrials. Every day, mainstream newspapers and online publications run high-profile articles on bitcoin, ICOs and decentralized approaches to everything from ridesharing and supply chain management to social media and healthcare.  Established companies are forming research consortia with their suppliers, vendors, competitors and new crypto startups to define the future open-source protocols of their industries. The World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral institutions are setting up blockchain labs for development and humanitarian objectives. Central banks are exploring programmable, digital fiat currency prototypes that, despite being government-controlled and centralized, could disintermediate banks and stoke a global competition for new monetary models.  Meanwhile, tens of thousands of entrepreneurs in dozens of different countries are launching moon-shot ideas to disrupt virtually every market on earth.  There is no turning back. The age of cryptocurrency has arrived.  More than market mania  To battle-hardened cryptographers and Wall Street veterans alike, it all looks a bit disturbing.  They cringe as newbies pile into digital assets while touts of varying integrity woo them with blockchain schemes based on untested, undeveloped or often non-existent technology.  The cynics' concerns are justified. People will lose money. A lot. Fingers of blame will be pointed. Mostly at the wrong parties.  But there's much more to this than the hype-stoked crypto markets. The intense attention on this unprecedented economic phenomenon is prompting people to ask some key, probing questions.  Where does this fervor for bitcoin come from? What's underlying it? Why does blockchain technology matter? Is it an opportunity for me, for my business, for society? Or is it a threat?  In the end, it matters not whether it's bitcoin, ethereum, or some other decentralizing technology that ends up framing our economic future. The most important thing is that people everywhere are starting to think about how a decentralized system of record-keeping and value exchange can flatten organizational hierarchies, reduce friction, expand access, open new markets and promote shared prosperity.  It's early days, but this unplanned global conversation could give rise to a ""Big Bang"" of crowdsourced ideas and entrepreneurship, one that evolves into an unstoppable wave of world-changing innovation.  Welcoming the chaos  What's exciting about this – and, let's face it, also scary – is that it's near impossible to predict where it will all go.  The important thing is to let the conversation and ideas happen while also encouraging as wide public input as possible into how this technology is governed, tested and allowed to evolve.  We know this from the history of the internet. The value of TCP/IP and of the various other open-source protocols of the internet was that, together, they formed an extensible platform. Anything could be built upon it. We just didn’t know what.  Engineers at DARPA, MIT, Stanford and other places who worked on what was then known as Arpanet say that, when first contemplating its possibilities, they imagined sending DOS-based text messages to each other or sharing files without having to carry a floppy disk from one computer to another. But that was about it.  They couldn't foresee everything else: blogs, Wikipedia, social media, online search, streaming audio and video, the cloud, e-marketplaces or ridesharing, much less how the internet would become the backbone of the entire global economy. That unforeseeable future required a much richer, collective imagination, one with global input.  What those engineers also couldn't foresee was that a failure to establish a truly decentralized trust-management system would allow new, centralized institutions to monopolize control of the global digital economy – the Googles, Amazons, Alibabas and Tencents of this world.  Now, at the dawn of the age of cryptocurrency, we have an obligation to get it right, to build a more open economy.  We must let the ideas flow, from every corner of the globe and from every community and interest group. And let those who generate them find the opportunity and the resources to turn them into something they can test, deploy and, hopefully, bring to market. We must promote a decentralized system of open-access that gives everyone a chance to succeed.  If the past few weeks are any indication, we're in for a chaotic ride. But our world's problems are too big to entrust to anything less than chaos.

The two organizations said Tuesday that they signed a memorandum of understanding committing themselves to finding ways to connect local energy markets to larger power networks using a blockchain-based platform.  EPEX SPOT is a power trading company based in France and covering Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland and Luxembourg. It allows users in each country to buy or sell excess power to each other.  The company's chairman, Jean-Francois Conil-Lacoste, said in a press release that the energy business faces challenges of ""unprecedented dimension.""  He continued:  “Innovative digital solutions are needed to further serve the market in this industry revolution and to drive forward the energy transition.”  LO3 will deploy its technology on community microgrids, such as the one it helped developed in its headquarters city of Brooklyn, N.Y., while EPEX SPOT will leverage its international power trading infrastructure to create a broader source of availability.  Essentially, consumers will be able to buy and sell surplus energy from neighbors or faraway strangers. LO3 has already been working on this, developing a platform called Exergy to facilitate local trades.  Among other trades, the partnership aims to help solar panel owners sell their excess energy back to the grid to be stored in batteries operated by the two groups, while consumers can purchase this excess energy during times of need.

42428253,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6p5h,1513141271,Scratch That: CryptoKitties Isn't Quite Ethereum's Vision for Apps,"Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin cried himself to sleep the night ""World of Warcraft"" maker Blizzard Entertainment altered his ""beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell.""  According to Buterin, the online role-playing game forever changed his outlook toward app development. ""On that day, I realized what horrors centralized services can bring,"" he writes on his official ""About.me.""  Aspiring to offer a ""world computer,"" ethereum has sought to stop similar occurrences by providing a platform on which decentralized applications (dapps) can run. But while a whole slew of startups is developing ethereum solutions for everything from social media to file sharing, none have yet to see a large, mainstream audience.  Apart from CryptoKitties.  An internet-based game for buying, selling and breeding adorable digital kittens, CryptoKitties has found itself in the center of a pop culture storm. Many have lauded the app for giving new users an easy, fun way to learn about cryptocurrency protocols, but others are strongly opposed to the app, which has been the cause of serious backlogs and rising transaction fees on the network.  But there's another issue with CryptoKitties that's being increasing called to attention: namely, your kitty isn't as decentralized as you think.  As least, that's the contention of some critics, who claim CryptoKitties, like World of Warcraft before it, is under the control of a central authority. Widely heralded as an unprecedented success for ethereum, questions have now begun to emerge about whether it's at the sacrifice of the fundamental concept of the project.  What's to stop the owner of the CryptoKitties smart contract, Kitty Core, from editing the algorithm and mutating a kitty against the will of its owner? According to its skeptics, not much.  As bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer, asked Vitalik Buterin on Twitter:  ""Did you read the cryptokitty contract? Ownership can change, owners can shut down the system at any time, and replace the contract arbitrarily.""  Domesticated cat  Because CryptoKitties is built on top of ethereum, many in the community assumed it was a dapp.  But that's not the case. Rather, the game is run within a centralized database, and mostly operates from one internet portal – the CryptoKitties website itself.  In this way, CryptoKitties has a central point of failure – one of the key reasons there is such enthusiasm for blockchain technology. With a decentralized model, if one company shuts down, others are there to pick up the slack; if a handful of servers go offline, others are there to keep the software running.  CryptoKitties critic and Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd told CoinDesk too much power is in the hands of the app's creators.  ""It'd be like if I sold you a cat, but then took away your ability to interact with it, see it, etc. For all practical purposes, you'd no longer have a cat,"" he told CoinDesk.  Adding to this, while the majority of the CryptoKitties code is open source – long touted as a key to decentralization – there are a few commands that have been kept hidden. For one, the genetic algorithm which creates the kittens is concealed, which according to the CryptoKitties team ""is what makes games like this fun.""  Those in the crypto space might not agree, especially since the execs at the firm have the power to halt this contract at any time, possibly inducing a wave of narcolepsy throughout the market.  Another quirk in the code allows the COO to create up to 5,000 copies of any kitten at any time, and although it's unlikely that Kitty Corp would deliberately sabotage its players, if a malicious actor hacked into their systems, there could be either a purge or an overpopulation of the furballs.  As Philip Daian, developer of security-focused smart contract programming language Viper, emphasized on Twitter:  ""I hope you guys realize you are placing a huge bounty on a contract used to breed virtual cats. The cryptokitty hackpocalypse will be very real, and deadly.""  Kitty fork  Even Buterin took to Twitter to comment on the current version of CryptoKitties, arguing that he believes it's a step in the right direction.  ""It's not close to fully decentralized in its current form,"" he said. ""But I think people see that it can be."" And, if necessary, Buterin later tweeted: ""I suspect the community will just hard fork the kitties.""  Still, someone could build a third-party software protocol to interact with CryptoKitties, since enough of the open-source code is public. This also means the the game's contract could evolve into new species – frogs for example.  Irrespective of the aspects of the code that aren't public, Parity representative and CryptoKitties enthusiast Afri Schoedon said, ""Nobody can prevent you or me or anyone else building your own 'CryptoFrogs' game on top of the CryptoKitties logic.""  And in his mind, that's as decentralized as CryptoKitties needs to be.  ""All important logic is hosted on the ethereum blockchain in smart contracts,"" he told CoinDesk.  Schoedon defended the centralized aspects of the game, explaining, ""they just reserved the right to keep some proprietary stuff centralized and host it on some web server for the convenience of a huge user base that never interacted with decentralized applications or ethereum before.""  Kitty Corp representatives echoed those comments, saying the company's primary intention was to make the game accessible for people new to crypto.  And decentralization will come with its trade-offs.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Griff Green, founder of decentralized charity Giveth, said that, currently, ""the options for creating a truly decentralized application are very limited and in the end impractical.""  When it comes to user experience, Green said, ""trying to run an app on the ethereum blockchain without using some help from central servers is UX suicide.""  In a blog post, the Kitty Corp team reflected on the issue, stating:  ""Completely decentralizing CryptoKitties would have resulted in a game that wasn't as fun, and we would have crippled our efforts to bringing blockchain to the masses.""

42428270,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6pZh,1513133121,Victory Lap? 2017 Was Bitcoin's Backwards Year,"Jim Harper is a vice president at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, where he works to adapt law and policy to the information age. He served as Global Policy Counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation in 2014.  This article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review opinion series.      2017 was another gloriously miserable year for bitcoin.  As in 2016  , gains in the price of bitcoin belie deep deficits in the cryptocurrency world. Bitcoin's stock of social capital, the human institutions around this most important technology, remains woefully deficient, and the capacity of bitcoin to deliver anything other than wealth to ""HODLers"" has fallen precipitously.  Don't get me wrong: wealth is great! But some of bitcoin's greatest potential benefits — global financial inclusion, broad gains for financial privacy, a stable money supply for those without, and increased liberty — appear further away now than they did a year ago, or at any time in bitcoin's history.  Big gains, bigger pond  Yes, bitcoin went up in price against fiat currencies this year. By a lot.  Increasingly recognized as an asset class uncorrelated to most others, bitcoin and crypto should be part of any smart investor's portfolio. That bodes well both for bitcoin and for investors. But, bitcoin’s ""market cap"" is worth keeping in perspective.  Among the arguments for conservatism in bitcoin scaling this year was that there was $30 billion in value (then $60 billion, then $100 billion) at stake. Those are big numbers, until you consider that the ""market cap"" of the four largest currencies in circulation is about $22.5 trillion.  Bitcoin's ""size"" is less than 1 percent of the mega-currencies, perhaps half that if you count all the rest. If it were possible to measure effects on humanity, bitcoin would probably rank even smaller than low tenths of a percent.  The pocket calculator has had a bigger influence on human progress than bitcoin. Velcro has improved human welfare more than cryptocurrency has.  Given its potential, that's a damning indictment of bitcoin's influence so far.  Bitcoin's social capital  Every invention has the potential to change the world to some degree. Most of them don't. That's because they lack social capital.  Social capital is ""everything else"" around a business, technology or product: knowledge of it, adoption of it, supportive customs and laws, integration into existing human institutions, and so on. It was necessary at one time to construct social capital around bananas.  Bitcoin still has strikingly little social capital. Few people know about it. Fewer still think it's beneficial or viable. Even fewer hold it, much less use it. The legal environment may be a tamed menace right now, but the broader lack of orientation toward bitcoin keeps that menace alive.  Perhaps those assertions sting, but don't blame the messenger: Bitcoin has simply not reached the level of ingratiation into society that it could and should have by now. That means that when bitcoin's price in fiat falls from whatever heights it reaches, it will plunge all the deeper and stay low all the longer.  There is a shallow reservoir of real institutions supporting our crypto future.  Scaling to low heights  The scaling debate is responsible for a good part of bitcoin's present failure relative to potential, and it illustrates the lack of social capital in spades.  Again this year, disputes over how to grow bitcoin consumed a tremendous amount of energy that would otherwise have gone toward building bitcoin along other dimensions. The slow pace of scaling assuredly drags adoption down.  Now, adoption isn't the only goal. But the scaling debate has been so acrimonious because neither Bitcoin Core, the project's leading developer team, nor the backers of the major alternatives have been able to string together and communicate a clear philosophy that animates their goals for bitcoin.  They haven't depicted in an accessible way how their technical decisions strike the proper balances among bitcoin community priorities. (Those things aren't easy to do, of course.)  Instead, SegWit2x was a slugfest that has now been ""suspended"" in bitterness.  Politicking, then progress  But along the way, a path to progress emerged in bitcoin-land.  The weeks leading up to the highly anticipated 2x fork had all the feel of a political campaign. With every argument exhausted, there was nothing left but barnstorming.  The debate shifted inexorably to the personal. There was even an ""October surprise"" of a sort, with the news that SegWit2x lead developer Jeff Garzik was involved with a new cryptocurrency called Metronome. (As in political campaigns, that development was shocking or not shocking, depending on one's pre-existing views of Garzik and SegWit2x.)  But while those political storms crashed, bitcoin cash was introduced to the world, almost as a side-note. That forked version of the bitcoin blockchain includes an 8 MB block size limit, and the SegWit modifications are stripped out. After a brief surge of interest, bitcoin cash began its long, slow surprise by continuing to exist.  Then, as part and parcel of the SegWit2x effort’s collapse, bitcoin cash became the major contender against Core for bitcoin leadership. Thus, a political campaign ended in a competition.  Bitcoin cash does not seek to change the software that miners and nodes run all at once, as SegWit2x did. It must work to gain market share: miners, nodes, and users that adopt this version of bitcoin.  Two bets  That is a commercial challenge, with the vectors of competition including transaction fee, coin price, transaction speed, mining rewards and ubiquity, and network size, as well as censorship resistance and other essential dimensions of security.  Brand recognition is part of that. That is why ""bcash"" is a grave insult to bitcoin cash supporters.  In money, network effects are a dominant dimension of quality, if not the dominant dimension, and Core has got it. So, bitcoin cash has a very long and difficult challenge before it.  But the bet laid down by bitcoin cash supporters is that the value proposition of a rarely traded and expensive digital gold is lower than a widely-used money that maintains enough of the properties of a blockchain-based currency. Bitcoin Core is a bet on security above all else.  As we conclude this gloriously miserable year in bitcoin, we should give thanks and say good luck to all the competitors.  Their efforts to retain or seek the lead will strengthen bitcoin, and if they build up bitcoin’s social capital, they will strengthen bitcoin all the more.

42428262,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL6pLh,1513123253,Bitcoin Futures Codes: How to Read Them And What They Mean,"Lanre Sarumi is the CEO of Level Trading Field, an interactive online platform for professionals in the finance industry.      When you read you begin with A, B, C.  When you sing you begin with Do, Re, Mi.  When you trade futures you begin with F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, X, Z.  Each of those letters represents the month of the year that the contract expires. Remember, with a futures contract, two counterparties agreed on a fixed price and date to trade an asset. The month of that date is represented by those letters.  I don't know who came up with that nomenclature or how. Just memorize it and move on. Although I'm sure there is going to be some know-it-all in the comment section saying ""I know!, I know!""  The products traded on the exchange also have product codes. Heating oil is RB, crude oil is CL and the bitcoin futures set to trade on the CME starting Dec. 18 will be BTC. On the CBOE, which introduced its bitcoin futures contract Sunday, the bitcoin product code is XBT.  If you want to trade the Jan. 2018 bitcoin contract, then, you will be trading BTCF8. BTC again represents bitcoin futures, ""F"" is the January code, ""8"" represents the year, 2018. If you want to trade the February 2018 BTC contract you trade BTCG8.  Pop quiz  What if you want to trade the Nov. 2017 BTC contract, what would it be called?  If you said BTCX7, you would be correct, but it's a trick question. We are in December 2017. The November contract, if it had existed, would have long expired by now. That brings up a very important point: If you have an open position in a physical delivery contract, you are subject to delivery.  If, for instance, you are long the gasoline contract, you may want to notify your neighbors that 42,000 gallons of Reformulated Gasoline Blendstock for Oxygen Blending may be rolling up anytime soon.  In the case of CME and the CBOE Bitcoin futures, however, the contract is cash settled. What this means is on the final day of the contract, the buyer is paid the difference between the value of the futures contract and the settlement price if the settlement price is higher than the value of the futures contract. If the value of the futures contract is greater than the settlement price, the seller is paid the difference. In dollars, not bitcoin.  What happens if you want to hold on to your futures position after the futures contract expires? If you are long the contract you can simply sell it and buy the contract for the next month. This sounds simpler than it is in practice. Remember the market is constantly moving on all contracts. If you don't mind paying a significant cost to do so then it really is a simple process. If you do, then you probably want the two-step process to happen simultaneously.  The process of selling or buying a futures contract and then simultaneously doing the opposite (buying or selling) another contract that expires later, is called spreading. Since the only difference between the two futures contracts is the expiration date, it is specifically called calendar spreading. If, after the process, you end up with opposite positions in two contracts, then you own a calendar spread.  Futures traders do a lot of spreading. Some do it for the reason described above, rolling an existing position into another month. Others do it to trade the price difference between two months.  If, for instance you know that a hard fork in the bitcoin blockchain is coming in March 2018 and you believe as a result of the fork, the March contract will be more valuable than the February 2018 contract, you can simultaneously sell the February contract and buy the March contract. You make money if your thesis is true and you can effectively do the trade as simultaneously as possible.  Some traders can pull this off successfully at very little cost, others successfully at very high cost. The definition of success for the latter group is an indulgence in generosity. The first group are usually high-frequency traders with fast computers.  The second group are folks not to0 dissimilar from the ones reading this article.  One and done  The futures exchanges, in the never-ending quest to help, and of course make a chunk of cash helping, have simplified the process.  You can buy or sell calendar spreads as a single contract. The exchange takes on the task of performing the process as one operation, so the trader is guaranteed to get the two positions at the same time. These are called exchange-traded calendar spreads. If you did the two-step process yourself, you end up with the same thing, but you executed a synthetic calendar spread.  Remember the exchange codes? Exchange calendar spreads wanted to join the party, so they were given their own names. The February/March calendar spread for bitcoin is at the CME is BTCG8-BTCH8. In other words, the February 2018 contract ""minus"" the March 2018 contract.  Essentially, the exchange calendar spreads are always long the first month and short the second month. If your goal was to sell the February contract and buy the March contract (your hard fork thesis), then you simply sell the BTCG8-BTCH8 exchange calendar spread.  If you are new to futures trading that is probably a lot to process. There is still a little more to learn before you print out your ""Certified Futures Trader"" certificate. In the next few articles, I’ll talk a little more about butterfly spreads, condors, box spreads andinter-commodity spreads.  After that, can you print out your ""certified futures trader"" certificate? Nope. You still have to learn about implied prices and how they affect the spreads.  After that, can you print your certificate? Nope, you still have to learn about price banding, price limits, contract size, and tick price.  After that you still have to learn about …. wait, where are you going?
