Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,606 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.90% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,894-$10,081  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price dropped below $10,000 Friday, sliding as low as $9,894 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase.      “It’s not the best look for BTC from a momentum and positive volume standpoint, to be honest,” said Constantine Kogan, partner at crypto fund of funds BitBull Capital.      Read More: V-Shaped Recovery From Bitcoin’s Biggest Drop Since March Unlikely      David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for crypto quantitative firm ExoAlpha, says traders are taking profit after bitcoin could not get past $12,100. It may seem like a long time ago but the price went as high as $12,058 only Tuesday.      “It looks like some bitcoin holders decided that this last failed breakout was one too many,” he told CoinDesk. “A full move could potentially bring the price back toward $9,500.      Lifchitz added that a few more fundamental factors that might be influencing the bearish bitcoin run.      “We observed that the market started to fade as South Korea’s largest exchange, Bithumb, had been raided by police,” he noted.      Read More: Police Reportedly Raid Headquarters of Bithumb      “It could also be miners deciding to monetize their rewards,” Lifchitz added. Indeed, bitcoin holders, which could include larger holders such as miners, are pushing more inflows into exchanges to its highest levels since late July.      “In my opinion, this is a classic case of an overstretched market, which had advanced too much too quickly, and so was in dire need of consolidation,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of multi-asset manager Tellurian Capital. “Crypto is dropping in sympathy with other traditional risk assets,” he added.      Equities indexes were in the red Friday:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 closed down 1.1% as major stocks in the pharmaceuticals, consumer staples and technology sectors fell.  Europe’s FTSE 100 ended the day slipping 0.88% as Bank of England officials forecast an economic downward trend for the balance of 2020.  The United States’ S&P 500 lost 0.50% after the index fell as low as 3.1% in early trading on dropping tech sector stocks but rallied later, with the banking sector eking out gains.    Alessandro Andreotti, an Italy-based crypto over-the-counter trader, is optimistic despite the currency cryptocurrency market environment. “Bitcoin has been extremely oversold. It actually reminds me of the March crash,” he said. “But, honestly, I think it can bounce back after this drop.”      Read More: Wasabi Wallet Patches Flaw That Could Have Thwarted Bitcoin Privacy    More crypto locked in DeFi    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Friday, trading around $392 and slipping 2.5% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

In the past week, the amount of bitcoin in DeFi has increased 33%.      “An amazing amount of BTC is locked into DeFi, earning hodlers ‘dividends’ for simply owning the asset,” noted Henrik Kugelberg, a Swedish crypto over-the-counter trader.

Alameda’s accumulation of 14,654 WBTC last month came after the quantitative trading firm lobbied in July for an increase in the amount of collateral placed to earn interest on the Compound platform from 0% to 40%. Notably, the firm had not minted WBTC prior to August.  The proposal was introduced and later approved after a previous proposal from Alameda to increase collateral to 65% was rejected.  At the time, the firm said WBTC would diversify the assets used for collateral on the platform and increase interoperability between Compound and MakerDAO, which also supports WBTC as collateral.  Alameda co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried has called wrapped bitcoin the “easiest bridge” between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s decentralized finance ecosystem.  A straw pollhttps://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmek6shlrhbansnskchm1tkgnkk7mlkxysbmgb1n2kxdsy passed Thursday in favor of increasing the number of dai, MakerDAO’s stablecoin, that can be minted from WBTC from 80 to 120 million. Some 14% of dai is derived from WBTC currently, according to Daistats. The motion is now set for an executive vote.  “Alameda has a tremendous reach within the market,” said Kiarash Mosayeri, product manager at BitGo, the company that helped spearhead Wrapped Bitcoin. “It's great to see another robust onramp help make Bitcoin more available for use on trustless protocols,” he told CoinDesk, speaking about the growing demand to use bitcoin in the Ethereum-base DeFi ecosystem.  Alameda's sister company, FTX, supports conversion between bitcoin and wrapped bitcoin on its derivatives exchange. Also Binance, a notable investor in FTX, announced its support for wrapped bitcoin on Monday.  Beyond wrapped bitcoin, the aggregate supply of all tokenized bitcoins tripled in August, as already strong demand to denominate DeFi-based trades and loans in bitcoin continues to grow.  Following July’s growth, DeFi gained over 26,000 freshly tokenized bitcoins in August with a total supply of nearly 55,000 tokenized bitcoins worth more than $333 million, according to Dune Analytics.  Notably, the supply of renBTC, the second-largest tokenized bitcoin project, exploded from just under 2,000 renBTC in July to over 13,500 renBTC in August.  Wrapped Bitcoin, still the dominant form of tokenized bitcoin, represented nearly 70% of the total supply of bitcoins on Ethereum.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MKR | RESEARCH,"Zack Voell, William Foxley",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/04/alameda-research-claimed-nearly-70-of-wrapped-bitcoin-minted-in-august,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c0c1905d03936fc7532ed987c54d723351d3408-935x629.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top shelf    Tether disputes Tether and affiliate exchange group iFinex have called for a market manipulation lawsuit to be dismissed because plaintiffs, they say, cannot prove $3 billion worth of unbacked stablecoins actually entered the market. Five crypto traders are suing the companies for incurred monetary losses after buying cryptocurrencies at prices they claim were inflated by Tether’s manipulation of the market. Plaintiffs claim Tether issued billions of dollars worth of dollar-backed cryptos, which Bitfinex then used to purchase cryptocurrencies on the open market to prop prices up during market downturns. Defendants' lawyers argue the claim USDT is not properly backed is based on ""unfounded allegations, and that it hasn’t been proven cryptocurrency prices were indeed artificial at the time in question.      New pairs BitMEX announced plans to introduce futures markets for two cryptocurrencies, chainlink (LINK) and tezos (XTZ), the first new coins to appear on the exchange in over two years. These two cryptos have seen triple-digit year-to-date returns. BitMEX last listed a new token in June 2018, when it announced a TRON/BTC futures market. Shortly before that announcement, the exchange removed six altcoin futures markets, including ethereum classic (ETC), zcash (ZEC), and monero (XMR). Notably, the new altcoin futures will trade against tether (USDT) instead of bitcoin (BTC). In Friday's announcement, BitMEX said the reason for this is because “USDT pairs account for over 60% of overall altcoin volume.”      Fee fixes? Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin released an improvement proposal (EIP 2929) Tuesday in a bid to ameliorate soaring network fees. Average network fees reached $15.21 on Wednesday, up 660% from $2 a month ago. The surge in fees is likely being driven by the growing use and number of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Buterin’s proposal would make “heavy” contracts, which update the Ethereum state, more expensive by a factor of three. This repricing proposal could break some smart contracts already operating on Ethereum, Buterin wrote, adding developers “have had years of warning” about potential changes. Necessary consensus to vote the proposal in could take weeks or months.      International regulation Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey said regulators have to come together for a ""global response"" to stablecoin issuance. Speaking Thursday, he said the international nature of stablecoins, which can be based in one country and operate in another, meant failure to coordinate could result in confusion and regulatory fragmentation. While admitting stablecoins could reduce frictional costs, even becoming the primary means for purchasing goods and services, regulators must ensure they maintain their 1:1 backing with fiat currencies. Further, Bailey called bitcoin unsuitable for payments and multi-asset backed crypto-dollars like libra premature. The BoE is actively researching a “digital pound.”      Quickening research Brazil’s chief central banker Roberto Campos Neto said Wednesday that his country could be ready for a digital currency (CBDC) by 2022. By that time, the Banco Central president said, Brazil will have an interoperable instant payments system and a ""credible"" and ""convertible"" international currency - ""all the ingredients to have a digital currency,"" he said at a Bloomberg event covered by local outlet Correio Braziliense. Campos Neto also was reported to have said that CBDCs are the consequence of fast-digitizing financial systems such as Brazil's.

Blockchain voting startup Voatz weighed in on a longstanding ruling about improper access to a “protected computer.”      Appearing in a “friend of the court” brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, the startup argued that bug bounty programs concerning cybersecurity should be operated under strict supervision.      The case, Van Buren v. United States, is centered around whether it is a federal crime for someone to access a computer “for an improper purpose,” if they already have permission to access other files on that computer.      Nathan Van Buren, the petitioner in the case, is a former Georgia police officer who was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which is often used to prosecute computer hackers. Enacted before the establishment of the internet, the CFAA prohibits accessing a “computer” without permission as well as the unauthorized deletion, alteration or blocking of privately stored data.      Some, like prominent lawyer Tor Eklend, believe the law is overly broad and outdated.      For his part, Van Buren claims a lower court ruling upholding his conviction could be taken to mean that “any ‘trivial breach’” of a computer system could be a federal crime. He was given permission to look up a license plate for an acquaintance.      In its brief, Voatz says the CFAA does not need to be narrowed, and some breaches of computer systems are necessary.      However, the firm argues researchers looking into potential vulnerabilities should specifically check with the companies they are evaluating prior to doing so, and should only proceed with authorization from the companies.      Late last year, a University of Michigan student or students participating in a security course likely accessed Voatz’ systems. In its brief, Voatz said the “students’ ill-advised activity” was reported to West Virginia officials, prompting an FBI investigation, because the company could not distinguish between their research and an actual hostile attack.      “Regardless of the particulars, however, the West Virginia incident illustrates the harm caused by attacking, or ‘researching,’ critical infrastructure without proper access or authorization especially in the middle of an election,” Voatz wrote.      Non-malicious researchers trying to break into digital tools “imposes significant additional costs” to organizations, Voatz said, and could harm public confidence.    Market intel    Reasons why Bitcoin prices fell below $11,000 yesterday for the first time in a month.      First Mover Editor Bradley Keoun spoke to market analysts for their take on why the market tanked. Here are the three most common responses.      1. Bitcoin is tracking traditional markets    “There could be an overlap between equity sellers and digital currency sellers. The largest equity market decliners this morning are tech stocks, including retail trading darlings, Tesla and the FAANG names [Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, once Google]. It is unclear if this will push into a continued broader crash in equity markets, which could put more pressure on digital currencies, or if it is just a short-term correction,"" John Todaro, director of institutional research at the cryptocurrency analysis firm TradeBlock, said.    2. DeFi sell-offs cascaded into bitcoin    The total value locked (TVL) in all DeFi applications dropped to $9.1 billion from $9.5 billion, over the past few days, according to the website DeFi Pulse. This may be related to drops in both ether and bitcoin's price.  ""Also, an aggressive unwind of the very crowded trade across Uniswap token related positions in the wake of a number of tokens, namely PIZZA and HOTDOG, dramatically collapsed from $6,000 to $1 in a mere few hours. This is likely because the same assets (bitcoin, ether and others) are used aggressively to structure collateralized positions,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the crypto prime broker BeQuant, said.    3. Miners sold some of their bitcoin    Blockchain-data analysis firm CryptoQuant found major bitcoin-mining pools have increased the amount of bitcoin they're transferred out, potentially as a de-risking maneuver.  “Miners are good traders. I think they are just looking for selling opportunities, not capitulation. I think it’s going to be the war of miners between those who want a bitcoin price rally and those who don’t. Some Chinese miners already realize their mining profitability (ROI), and they might not want new mining competitors joining the industry because of the bull market,"" Ki Young Yu, founder of CryptoQuant, said.    Risk off? Bitcoin isn’t likely to see a quick rebound from the double-digit price drop over the last two days, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. Bitcoin fell by over 10% on Thursday to $10,006, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the biggest single-day percentage decline since March 12 when prices crashed around 40% amid a major sell-off across the equities markets. Though up slightly, Matthew Dibb, Stack COO, thinks bitcoin will track traditional assets during “this 'risk-off' period.” ""Macro factors are currently at play,” Dibbs said.    Tech pod    Wallet forks Wasabi Wallet has hard-forked the wallet Thursday to address a vulnerability for a hypothetical attack the team assumes has never been carried out. Discovered by a team member at Trezor, a leading maker of hardware wallets, the vulnerability would have interfered with the wallet’s implementation of CoinJoin, a privacy protocol. Users need to upgrade to the latest version of the wallet if they want to continue using the CoinJoin feature. “The flaw’s discovery is another example of the open-source community’s camaraderie and cooperation,” CoinDesk’s Colin Harper reports.    Op-ed    Stablecoin opportunity Nic Carter, a CoinDesk columnist and partner at Castle Island Ventures, believes the billion-dollar stablecoin market presents an opportunity for the United States, not a threat. “If the U.S. chooses to marginalize crypto-dollars and punish their issuers, not only will they suppress a burgeoning American industry, they will also push users into even less accountable alternatives,” he writes.

42432603,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0FBh,1599236950,Money Reimagined: Defanging FAANG,"Most people would be happy to have World Wide Web creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s wealth, which is reportedly somewhere between $10 million and $60 million.      Yet, Berners-Lee’s net worth pales into insignificance against that of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who last week became the first person ever to be worth more than $200 billion.      There’s something wrong with this picture. The inventor of an information system that transformed the world has earned from it a tiny sliver – no more than 0.03% – of that which has flowed to someone who controls one of that system’s 2 billion websites. Amazon.com has delivered Bezos a fortune that exceeds the gross domestic product of 159 countries and is 3.3 million times more than the U.S. median household income.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      Many Americans will view Bezos’ Amazon, whose $1.73 trillion market capitalization makes it the second-most valuable corporation in the world, as a symbol of the U.S. economy’s success. The same people think similarly about the U.S. roots of the four other companies in the world’s top five: Apple, which last month became the first company to surpass a valuation of $2 trillion and is now at $2.1 trillion; Microsoft ($1.71 trillion); Google owner Alphabet ($1.1 trillion); and Facebook ($835 billion.)      I argue the opposite: These ridiculously large numbers are evidence of a deep problem with the American economy.      This is not the argument of a socialist, as I have sometimes been wrongly described by people who hear me say such things. I thoroughly believe in a free market economy in which entrepreneurs are incentivized through profits to improve and grow their businesses.      It’s just that there’s no way a single person or company can accumulate such a colossal amount of money, relative to that of everyone else, without operating a competition-killing monopoly, without acting as a rent-seeking gatekeeper of others’ capacity to generate income and innovate.      This is the destructive nature of the centralized platforms the internet has spawned, a situation that gives Berners-Lee such angst that he’s now seeking to tame the beast he created. With network effects to their advantage, these behemoths have a data-monopolizing capacity that lets them control and quash competition. And their algorithms have accumulated such a deep knowledge of user behavior that they can bend us to their will. It’s a power as great or more than that of governments, which is why they represent as big a threat to the free market as excessive regulation.      A solution may lie in a new breed of blockchain-powered “Web 3.0” protocols. These will give users control over their data and enable them to join decentralized communities and marketplaces to share content and products without middlemen. These models could break the back of the internet platforms’ – so long as users can be convinced to migrate away from them.      Still, even if these newcomers are successful, the Bezos lessons should be heeded. Power bases forming in the blockchain ecosystem around “whales” resemble those of the centralized internet, where a capacity to set the rules of the game are vested in a few. The crypto community should welcome innovative governance solutions that push back against that inequity and foster broader distributions of power.    Limiting the spoils of growth    Monopolies harm an economy for various reasons. In the trust-busting era of President Theodore Roosevelt, the concern was that an absence of competition empowered companies to impose above-market prices on consumers. But they also constrain innovation, creating an opportunity cost for society. If better alternatives to the status quo aren’t brought to market, productivity stagnates.      Capital markets perpetuate this problem. Investors favor the big guys – witness the investment advisor mantra of “just buy FAANG” (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) – leaving their competitors with comparatively more expensive capital, which only makes the challenge of surpassing the platforms even bigger.      Their advantage is buttressed by legal ambiguity. Antitrust laws fixate on the prices paid by consumers, but as the American Economic Liberties Project notes in a piece calling Amazon a “21st century gatekeeper,” the consumer harm done by the e-commerce giant “tends to be disguised or hard to calculate.” The report’s authors say regulators should instead be looking at how it manipulates everyone – suppliers, potentially competitive startups and customers – by placing them into “a position of dependency, and then exploiting that dependency to leverage itself into powerful positions in new markets.”      It’s not clear, though, that the solution lies with government.      Washington could, for example, break up Amazon, Facebook et al. But what’s to stop each of the component parts obtaining their own gatekeeper powers? Alternatively, it could regulate the platforms as utilities. But do we really want Uncle Sam regulating – censoring? – an information platform? Or it could subsidize promising startups aiming to beat the platforms at their game. But even if a challenger can garner the network effects necessary to overcome barriers to entry, their own shareholders will ultimately pressure them into using the same exploitative methods.    Web 3.0 to the rescue?    This is where crypto-based solutions hold promise. In Web 3.0, user networks exist on top of a decentralized protocol that no single party controls.      Web 3.0 startups must still convince users to migrate from a big, proven network to a small, unproven one, but growing concerns about privacy, censorship and fraught battles over disinformation, “fake news” and toxic behavior could encourage them to do so. And recent progress in the development of Web 3.0’s underlying infrastructure offers hope that gatekeeper-bypassing internet applications are on the horizon.      Interoperability protocols such as Cosmos and Polkadot, which allow digital asset exchanges across blockchains, have reached key development and funding milestones in recent months. Decentralized storage and hosting solutions such as Sia and Filecoin are garnering both user and investor interest. A host of self-sovereign digital identity providers are starting to offer users a way to keep their data private and interact autonomously with each other without relying on the platforms’ identity management systems. And all this is happening during an explosion of innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), which could enable smoother integration of payments and finance in a Web 3.0 environment.    Crypto inequity    To be clear, blockchains are no panacea against monopoly.      For one, crypto has its own inequality issue. Because of sharp price appreciation and the front-loaded issuance schedules built into many cryptocurrency protocols, a small number of early adopters have profoundly more wealth than the vast majority of later participants. (One analysis of Bitcoin’s Gini wealth coefficient, a common measure of wealth inequality, put it in a range of 0.88 to 0.98 between 2012 and 2019, higher than any country in the world.)      One could argue it’s the removal of gatekeeping intermediaries, not inequality itself, that matters. But the reality is that “whales” with large token holdings have outsized influence over blockchain governance systems and can often dictate terms in their favor. This is especially so in proof-of-stake consensus systems and it’s playing out in voting on interest rates, collateral rules and other parameters attached to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.      It’s also relevant to bitcoin. Wealth is necessary to build the big mining farms needed to consistently win block rewards and although core development work is, by definition, a not-for-profit activity, the most prolific contributors to its code are funded by wealthy bitcoiners. While their financiers’ largesse is justified in terms of protecting a public good, their direct line to the engineers affords them real influence over protocol development.      Still, blockchain-based protocols create opportunities for founders to experiment with governance to get around these problems, which, encouragingly, is happening in DeFi. (See the item on “fair launches” below.)      We’ll never attain utopia, but at least in crypto there’s an innovation-driven approach to finding a path to it.    Denominators matter    At a glance, the first chart below from DeFi Pulse, which tracks the value of all crypto assets locked as collateral in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, suggests the spectacular bubble of August might have met its end in early September.      And yes, the first week of September is a reminder that what goes up can come down. Still, it’s worth looking at the charts further below the first one to remind ourselves that discussions of crypto value tend to be distorted by the denominator of measured historical performance. Any assessment of the U.S. dollar (USD) value of funds invested in DeFi collateral contracts is beholden to the value of the dollar itself, which will vary against the key crypto denominators according to a vast array of factors that have very little to do with DeFi.      The charts below measure the amount of actual a) ether or b) bitcoin that’s locked up in DeFi contracts.      The good news for DeFi believers is that even with the damage that this week’s sell-off has done to the dollar value of bitcoin and ether, the crypto community’s internal bets on the DeFi system continued to rise, albeit at a slower rate. The unanswered question is, how truly independent of the fiat world is this system? Will the past week’s slide in the value of ether and bitcoin versus the dollar start to impact how holders of those cryptocurrencies think about their yield-earning opportunities in DeFi? Or are there now greater incentives to cash out back into dollars? Time will tell.    Global town hall    FAIR LAUNCH = FREE LUNCH? One of the hottest of the many hot new speculative projects to flow through the booming DeFi universe has been that of yearn.finance, whose YFI token soared by more than 700% in August to flirt with a $1 billion market capitalization. It was more than the price gain that got people excited. It’s that the founder, Andre Cronje, launched the project without retaining any of the tokens for himself beforehand, carrying out what’s being called a “fair launch.” Unlike the leaders of many projects who typically set aside around 20% of tokens to compensate founders and developers for the time and effort put into building the project, Cronje and his team had to commit their own capital and time their bets right to ride the speculative boom in YFI.      One reason why this is appealing is that it creates a framework for more equitable governance of the tokens, whose conditions are determined by token holders according to the protocol’s consensus-based voting system. Typically, the largest holders can sway votes, which means token-holding founders can set the game up in their favor. Ian Lee, IDEO CoLab Ventures managing director, says such models pose a threat to venture capital managers like himself. If projects can launch without prior equity or token exposure for either founders or funders, what’s in it for VCs? he asked in a blog post.      Who would fund such projects? People who simply want to see new financial innovations live in the wild and are prepared to bet further on them after they’re built. Well, Lee and some of his team members appear to be among those types of people, as they quickly rolled out a new concept – note: not an entity per se – called “fair launch capital.” Described as a “community resource providing free access to capital for new Fair Launch networks and projects,” the group is receiving an “incredible amount of interest and support from the crypto community,” he said.      Meanwhile, Yearn itself fostered a new concept that could further unlock capital for such launches: a “delegated funding DAO vaults,” which essentially use the power of connections and relationships, along with some fancy insurance-like mechanisms, to provide unsecured lending for developers of such projects. A lot of bets will go wrong, no doubt. But this kind of experimentation with new forms of governance, risk management and credit are what make the DeFi movement so interesting.      PEOPLE’S PRIVACY. When it comes to China, the only thing to be said with any certainty is that mainstream Western portrayals will employ sweeping generalizations and miss a more nuanced reality. In a well-written take on Beijing’s surprisingly robust efforts to boost data privacy standards, MIT Technology Review writer Karen Hao describes one such situation.      While the article lays out the familiar story of the expansion of state surveillance under President Xi Jinping and the growing use of “social score” metrics, it also reveals how a pro-privacy activism among Chinese citizens is prompting some aggressive data protection responses from top Chinese officials, including measures that constrain the actions of provincial government agencies. With the country now implementing a legal model quite similar to that of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), tensions with the national government’s own data collection strategy seem likely to arise. It remains to be seen what all this means for China’s implementation of its Digital Currency Electronics payments system, which Western critics often describe in ominous terms as a privacy-destroying “panopticon.”      As Hao writes, China’s privacy protection effort “raises a question: Can a system endure with strong protections for consumer privacy, but almost none against government snooping?” To be sure, that system, otherwise known as the Chinese Communist Party, has managed to accommodate many such contradictions in the past. But the message here is that we should not underestimate the voice of the Chinese citizenry – or, more precisely, of its Netizens, as China’s internet activists have become known.      THIS MEANS WAR. Those of us who write about how governments, companies and decentralized communities will compete to define the digital money of the future often use the term “currency war” to describe the competition for people’s monetary trust that looms on the horizon. The winner is the one that attracts the most demand and, therefore, most likely, rises the highest in value. But in traditional foreign exchange markets, the concept applies more to central banks using their powers of intervention and monetary policy to competitively drive down the value of their national currencies – in other words, reduce demand for them – so as to boost exports and make imports more expensive.      With the dollar falling consistently due the Federal Reserve’s aggressive COVID-19 monetary easing measures, concerns about such a war arising were given a boost when European Central Bank’s Chief Economist Philip Lane made what some labeled as a “verbal intervention” just as a rising euro was approaching the psychologically significant level of $1.20. As Bloomberg Opinion writers Mark Gilbert and Marcus Ashworth warn in response to Lane’s remarks, “A full-blown currency war … could distract policy makers from their key task of mending the post-pandemic global economy.”      All Lane said was, “The euro-dollar rate does matter” because it “feeds into our global and European forecasts and that in turn does feed into our monetary policy setting.” That’s a pretty indisputable point. Yet, the euro fell immediately after he’d dropped the comment. The remarks did break with international protocol, by which central bankers are supposed to resist mentioning their currencies and instead focus on domestic economic conditions, even when those conditions are the result of exchange rate changes. But it was hardly a declaration of war. Such is the super-sensitivity around the value of money right now that modest shifts in language can send markets into a tizz. There’s an end-game feeling to this.    Relevant reads    The Crypto-Dollar Surge and the American Opportunity. Don’t fear stablecoins, embrace them. That’s CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter’s message to U.S. policymakers. Yes, encouraging the use of these dollar-denominated digital bearer assets would entail giving up on the international surveillance that bank-based dollar surveillance grants the U.S., but the free flow of a new form of money with its roots in the U.S. will ultimately serve U.S. interests, Carter argues. The alternative is to allow people suffering under the regimes of pariah states like Venezuela to migrate to “slipperier alternatives.”      3 Reasons Bitcoin Just Tanked Below $11K for First Time in a Month. Bitcoin’s price has been on a rollercoaster ride this past week. After BTC briefly got above the psychologically important $12,000 mark in the New York afternoon Wednesday, successive waves of selling that began in Asian hours Thursday had pushed it within a few dollars of $10,000 just 24 hours later. Although it bounced off that level, the largest cryptocurrency was still struggling as of this writing Friday. Why the sell-off mid-week? Brad Keoun offers three plausible explanations.      For DeFi to Grow, CeFi Must Embrace It. For all the excitement around the DeFi phenomenon, it is still a miniscule part of even the cryptocurrency market. To make it more mainstream, CoinDesk contributor William Mougayer argues the centralized exchanges that dominate the larger, more liquid form of crypto investing should engage with DeFi protocols. How? By listing their tokens, building new, easier-to-understand products and creating user-friendly marketing information to bring them into the mainstream.

In a speech published last week, Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general at the DoJ's Antitrust Division, said blockchain could prevent or limit the concentration of market power, improving competition in a whole host of industries.  He said: ""[I]t is of utmost importance that we prevent competitive abuses in markets where blockchain may offer consumers and business lower-cost or higher-value options.""  Delrahim said the Antitrust Division would try to understand how businesses are implementing blockchain solutions as well as the possible effects it could have on market competition.  He also said the division would try to anticipate how incumbents could try to stop or limit the potential of blockchain solutions so they can maintain market-dominant positions.  This could include using private blockchains to deny rivals access to crucial market infrastructure, he said.  Thibault Schrepel, an assistant professor in Antitrust Law at Utrecht University School of Law and faculty affiliate at Standford University's CodeX Center, told CoinDesk the antitrust chief could be subtly hinting that blockchain could disrupt big tech monopolies.  In his speech, Delrahim added that critical questions remain, such as whether existing intermediaries have any place at all within a blockchain-based market system.  It's also possible, the antitrust chief said, that the role of blockchain could change over time as it faces further mainstream adoption.

42432597,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0F5h,1599225859,"First Mover: Buying Bitcoin's Dip, Betting Against Tether and Weighing the Jobs Report","You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team and edited by Bradley Keoun, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      HOLIDAY NOTICE: First Mover will publish next on Tuesday, Sept. 8. Happy Labor Day to our U.S. readers.    Price Point    Bitcoin (BTC) was up in early trading to $10,500, rebounding after Thursday's 11% tumble, the biggest single-day decline since March.      The sell-off, which took prices as low as about $10,000, coincided with a rout in U.S. stocks, rekindling long-simmering discussions over whether the largest cryptocurrency was a safe haven like gold or merely another risky asset. Prices for ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, slid 13%, potentially a sign of an unwind of the recent fervor in decentralized finance, or DeFi. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell and the dollar gained in foreign-exchange markets, indicating a flight to safety by traditional investors.      Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund BitBull Capital, told First Mover in an email that ""$10,000 still stands as a strong support and has absorbed selling pressure fairly well in the last two instances."" John Kramer, a trader at crypto over-the-counter firm GSR, told CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey that “many investors will see this as an opportunity to buy the dip.”    Market Moves    After years of debating whether tether (USDT) is fully backed 1-for-1 with U.S. dollars, the stablecoin’s critics and defenders alike can now put their money where their mouths are.      Opium, a derivatives exchange, has introduced credit default swaps (CDS) for USDT. The product, launched Thursday, insures the buyer in the event of default by Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin and fifth-largest cryptocurrency overall.      As Opium’s blog points out, USDT is the lifeblood of the borderless cryptocurrency marketplace. The oldest stablecoin, USDT remains the largest such cryptocurrency by market cap and a top-five coin overall with $13.8 billion in issuance. Traders often use it to move money in and out of exchanges quickly to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities.      “You can use it to protect yourself against (or speculate on) a systemic failure of the most widely used stablecoin in crypto,” Opium said of the new CDS contract, in a blog post to be published Thursday.      There are nagging questions about the issuer's creditworthiness. The firm behind USDT is under investigation by the New York Attorney General’s office for alleged misappropriation of funds, and Tether revealed in April 2019 that only 74% of USDT was backed by “cash and cash equivalents.”      Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Tether, said through a spokesman: “Tether is solvent. Therefore, this solution is not really interesting to us or our community.”      Read More: New Crypto Derivatives Let You Bet on (or Against) Tether’s Solvency      The solution might be interesting to traders who just want a little extra assurance.      -William Foxley    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin's options market has flipped bearish with the cryptocurrency registering its first double-digit decline in six months on Wednesday. Prices fell to a low of $10,006 before recovering to $10,500.    The one- and three-month put-call skews that measure the cost of puts relative to that of calls have surged above zero, a sign of investors adding bets (put options) to position for a more profound price drop.  Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Group and macro trader at MarketPunks, who had warned earlier this week when prices were closer to $12,000 that a correction might be looming, also sees scope for additional price declines on the back of risk aversion in equity markets.  ""The next key support comes in the form of the June low at around $8,900,"" Kruger told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat and added further that bitcoin would eventually realize its potential as store of value.

Binance said Friday users would be able to provide liquidity and make trades, or ""swaps,"" initially with three trading pairs from their exchange accounts.  Called Binance Liquid Swap, the platform is in effect an automated market maker (AMM) exchange where smart contract-based liquidity pools set spot prices and facilitate swaps.  In AMM exchanges, users become liquidity providers by depositing digital assets into the pools, receiving in return interest and a cut of transaction fees.  This is the same model used by Uniswap and SushiSwap – two decentralized exchanges (DEXs) now at the center of the white-hot decentralized finance space.  In a blog post, Binance said Liquid Swap is the first AMM platform to be launched on top of a centralized exchange.  When asked if Binance was moving into direct competition with the likes of Uniswap and SushiSwap, a company spokesperson told CoinDesk that Liquid Swap was aimed at an audience more at home on centralized exchanges.  ""The crypto industry is still in its early stages, and there is still a barrier of entry for decentralized products,"" they said.  With the new platform, Binance aims to offer users ""a more secure and seamless product while allowing them to earn as on decentralized AMM pools,"" according to the spokesperson.  The three initial trading pairs will be USDT/BUSD, BUSD/DAI, and USDT/DAI.  Binance first ventured into DeFi with its decentralized exchange in April 2019, built on top of its native Binance Chain.

In an order signed Thursday, Judge Beth Bloom at the District Court in the Southern District of Florida granted the joint motion from Wright and plaintiff Ira Kleiman to move the trial from the previous date of Oct. 13.  Judge Bloom further extended some pre-trial deadlines to mid- and late December.  The case was brought by Kleiman on behalf of the estate of his late brother David, who had worked with Wright in the early days of bitcoin.  Ira is suing Wright for half of his alleged fortune of 1.1 million bitcoin (worth over $11 billion) he claims the two mined together, as well as intellectual property.  A jury trial was ordered in June after an attempt by Kleiman to sanction Wright over his claimed misbehavior in court was denied.  Judge Bloom said at the time she was concerned by the facts of the allegations, but ruled the matter was best left “for a jury to make as fact finder at trial.”  She took into account that Wright had provided an expert witness to testify that he had been diagnosed with autism to explain his erratic testimony.  Wright has proclaimed himself as the inventor of bitcoin, known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

42432595,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0Ezh,1599217627,"V-Shaped Recovery From Bitcoin's Biggest Drop Since March Unlikely, Say Analysts","Despite a slight bounce Friday morning, some analysts don't expect bitcoin to chart a quick recovery from the double-digit price drop over the last two days.    Bitcoin fell by over 10% on Thursday to $10,006, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  That's the biggest single-day percentage decline since March 12 when bitcoin prices crashed around 40% amid a major sell-off across the equities markets.  Other data sources such as Bitstamp even logged bitcoin as dropping a little below $10,000.  At the press-time price of $10,520, the cryptocurrency is down 18.59% from the recent high of $12,476 registered on Aug. 17.  Similar double-digit price pullbacks observed in April and May were quickly reversed in a couple of days, a sign of buy-the-dip mentality.  This time, though, a quick V-shaped recovery back to recent highs around $12,000 looks unlikely due to cryptocurrency's increased sensitivity to traditional markets.  ""The worst may be behind us, but bitcoin can take days to form a good base,"" crypto analyst Edward Morra, who called the market top at $12,000, tweeted early on Friday.  Matthew Dibb, co-founder, and COO of Stack, a provider of cryptocurrency trackers and funds, told CoinDesk that prices could drop below $10,000 if the global equity markets retrace.  ""Macro factors are currently at play, and bitcoin shows a higher correlation to global equities markets in this 'risk-off' period,"" Dibb said.  Indeed, sharp losses on Wall Street look to have accentuated the bitcoin price drop on Thursday.  Stocks may extend the sell-off, pushing bitcoin below $10,000 on Friday if the all-important U.S. non-farm payrolls report shows the labor recovery is losing momentum.  The data, scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC, is forecast to show the economy added 1.4 million jobs in August versus 1.76 million additions in July.  Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Group and macro trader at MarketPunks also sees scope for additional price declines on the back of risk aversion in equity markets.  ""The next key support comes in the form of the June low at around $8,900,"" Kruger told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  However, he still expects bitcoin will eventually realize its potential as a store of value.  Additionally, activity in the bitcoin options market suggests investors are adding bets to position for an extended decline in the cryptocurrency.  The one-month and three-month put-call skews have recovered sharply to positive territory this week.  That's probably due to investors buying put options (bearish bets) to hedge buy positions in the spot/futures market, according to Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5.

Lawyers for Tether and iFinex – the parent firm of the Bitfinex exchange – filed a motion Thursday calling for a class action accusing them of deceptive, anti-competitive and market-manipulative behavior to be dismissed with prejudice.  Claiming they had lost money as a result, the plaintiffs alleged in a complaint last October that over five years Tether issued as much as $3 billion-worth of unbacked USDT tokens, which Bitfinex then used to purchase cryptocurrencies on the open market to prop prices up during market downturns.  Per the complaint, this allegedly caused the total market cap of cryptocurrencies to skyrocket to $795 billion in late 2017.  The plaintiffs are five crypto traders who allege that they bought cryptocurrencies at inflated prices and, therefore, incurred monetary losses. As a class action, the suit represents anyone in the U.S. who might also have been injured by inflated prices.  But in a supporting memorandum, the defendants' lawyers argue the case falls down partly because the accusation Tether printed its USDT stablecoins without any actual backing is based on ""unfounded allegations,"" rather than direct knowledge of the matter.  They also argue the plaintiffs have not demonstratively shown that cryptocurrency prices were indeed artificial at the time in question.  This means, according to the memorandum, that accusations of market manipulation and RICO conspiracy should be thrown out because plaintiffs can't prove they actually suffered a monetary loss at the hands of the defendants – a pre-requisite in the U.S.  Allegations of anti-competitive and monopolistic behavior should also be thrown out because the class action doesn't show how defendants tried to claim a dominant market position by raising prices or restricting output, the memorandum reads.  iFinex and Tether are battling two other separate cases on similar accusations that USDT isn't properly backed by collateralized reserves.  These include one suit brought by the New York Attorney General's office in April 2019.  According to market data site CoinGecko, Tether has a circulating supply of over 10 billion USDT, which are aimed to maintain a value of $1 each.  Tether's website lists as ""proof of funds"" a letter from Washington-based law firm FFS, an affirmation that the company held $2.538 billion as of June 1, 2018.  The company states, however, that USDT is ""backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.""

42432585,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0Ehh,1599208375,Voatz Calls for Restrictions on Independent Cybersecurity Research in Supreme Court Brief,"Blockchain voting startup Voatz argued that bug bounty programs concerning cybersecurity should be operated under strict supervision in a ""friend of the court"" brief before the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS).      Voatz weighed in Thursday on Van Buren v. United States, a Supreme Court case examining whether it is a federal crime for someone to access a computer “for an improper purpose” if that person already has permission to access other files on that computer.      Nathan Van Buren, the petitioner in the case, is a former Georgia police officer who was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) after looking up a license plate for an acquaintance. Van Buren claims that a lower court ruling that upheld his conviction could be taken to mean that “any ‘trivial breach’” of a computer system could be a federal crime.      The case’s scope appears to have broadened, addressing not just breaches, but how the CFAA itself can be interpreted. The question listed on SCOTUS briefs reads:    “Whether the evidence was sufficient to establish that petitioner, a police sergeant, exceeded his authorized access to a protected computer to obtain information for financial gain, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(2)(C) and (c)(2)(B)(i), when in exchange for a cash payment, he searched a confidential law-enforcement database for information about whether a particular person was an undercover police officer.”    The U.S., the respondent, argued the case is “poor vehicle” for examining whether the CFAA is too broad, and said in its brief that SCOTUS review isn’t even warranted.      In its brief, Voatz said the CFAA does not need to be narrowed, and some breaches of computer systems are necessary. However, the firm argues researchers looking into potential vulnerabilities should specifically check with the companies they are evaluating prior to doing so, and should only proceed with authorization from the companies.      See also: Voatz and Why We Can’t Trust Online Voting Just Yet      “Bug bounty programs are highly effective,” Voatz wrote. “They are extremely widespread in the technology industry, and even outside that industry, one survey in 2019 reported that 42% of companies outside of the technology industry were running a crowdsourced cybersecurity program.”      The brief may come in response to another filed by a group of security researchers who argue the CFAA has indeed “been interpreted too broadly,” which is holding back computer security efforts. This brief criticizes Voatz among its other arguments.    Broad rules    Voatz has notably faced criticism from cybersecurity researchers, including by a team at MIT who published a report in February claiming Voatz had insufficient transparency and that its internal systems faced a number of vulnerabilities. Voatz has disputed the claims in the report.      Trail of Bits, another cybersecurity firm tapped by Voatz to conduct an audit of its systems, confirmed the MIT researchers’ claims in a subsequent report.      Voatz has tussled directly with researchers as well. Late last year, U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart of the Southern District of West Virginia announced the Federal Bureau of Investigation was looking into “an unsuccessful attempted intrusion” into Voatz, which was likely caused by a University of Michigan student or students participating in a security course.      In its brief, Voatz said the “students’ ill-advised activity” was reported to West Virginia officials because the company could not distinguish between their research and an actual hostile attack.      “Regardless of the particulars, however, the West Virginia incident illustrates the harm caused by attacking, or ‘researching,’ critical infrastructure without proper access or authorization especially in the middle of an election,” Voatz wrote.      Non-malicious researchers trying to break into digital tools “imposes significant additional costs” to organizations, the legal brief said, and could harm public confidence.      See also: ‘Snake Oil and Overpriced Junk’: Why Blockchain Doesn’t Fix Online Voting      Jake Williams, who founded Rendition Security, told CNET that a “vast majority” of cybersecurity researchers likely do not have authorization, meaning Voatz’s support for a broad CFAA would “100% make it more difficult” for researchers.      Voatz’s brief comes a day after it published a press statement claiming the Michigan Democratic Party used its app during a recent party convention when voting for a number of positions. The Michigan Democratic Party did not immediately return a request for comment.    Contrary views    Voatz’s arguments aside, its brief makes a number of citations and claims that seem to lack context.      Voatz says it has been used in 70 elections, including state and municipal elections, and claims in the brief that it is considered “critical infrastructure” by the Department of Homeland Security.      The elections include West Virginia (which announced in March it would not be using Voatz for its upcoming elections) and Utah County (whose clerk and auditor received a $1,500 campaign donation from Overstock CEO Jonathan Johnson, who is also the president of Voatz investor Medici Ventures).      The company has said it’s meeting requirements by Pro V&V, a federal Voting System Test Laboratory, but according to Politico cybersecurity reporter Eric Geller, “the report is meaningless” because the standards were set years ago and the evaluation was not objective.      Eddie Perez, the global director of tech development at the Open Source Election Technology Institute, wrote that the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the federal entity that accredited Pro V&V, doesn’t actually have any national standards for remote voting systems.      See also: Hardware Wallet Flaw Lets Attackers Hold Crypto for Ransom Without Touching Device      The EAC itself released a statement saying “these test reports should not be viewed as implicit approval by either the [voting system test laboratories] or the EAC that the evaluated systems are compliant with the [voluntary voting system guidelines] standard or are equivalent to an EAC-certified voting system.”      ""Currently these programs are organized by Voatz itself, but in the past some were conducted through a vendor such as HackerOne Inc.,” the brief said. It did not mention that HackerOne severed ties with Voatz in March.      What’s more, HackerOne founder and CTO Alex Rice said on Twitter that “we support the opposing arguments made by” the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which calls for a narrowing of the CFAA, unlike Voatz, which cited HackerOne in the brief.      Similarly, Casey Ellis, founder and CTO of crowdsourced security platform Bugcrowd, which Voatz cited a number of times, also wrote that he signed off on and supported the EFF’s brief, and not Voatz’s.      Both Rice and Ellis said Voatz did not contact them prior to filing the brief.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/04/voatz-calls-for-restrictions-on-independent-cybersecurity-research-in-supreme-court-brief,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5f405557098da98d75720c8083855ceff9d14a23-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The stalwart cryptocurrency derivatives exchange announced new futures markets for chainlink (LINK) and tezos (XTZ), two cryptocurrencies with triple-digit year-to-date returns, in addition to new contracts for eos (EOS) and cardano (ADA), two coins already traded in futures markets on BitMEX.  Tezos has traded on BitMEX before, however. Prior to the project’s initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, XTZ/BTC futures were listed on BitMEX and settled at the sale price of 0.0002 BTC per tezos.  The last time BitMEX listed a new token was June 2018, when it announced a TRON/BTC futures market.  Shortly before that announcement, the exchange removed six altcoin futures markets, including ethereum classic (ETC), zcash (ZEC), and monero (XMR).  Notably, the new altcoin futures will trade against tether (USDT) instead of bitcoin (BTC). In Friday's announcement, BitMEX said the reason for this is because “USDT pairs account for over 60% of overall altcoin volume.” By listing tether pairs, “we are providing users with the trading options to better meet their needs,” BitMEX said.
