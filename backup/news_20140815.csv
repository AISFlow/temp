42377545,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71o9z,1408141514,"All Things Alt: Sync's Stability Bid, an Ivy League Alt and a Coin for World Domination","There are plenty of fresh faces and seasoned coin networks taking the altcoin world by storm these days, offering plenty of excitement (both the good and the bad kind) for those involved. Between the market fluctuations, of course, are the interesting and, at times, one-of-a-kind threads that make the alt scene what it is.  For just a taste of what’s happening around the community (as there’s never enough time to cover it all), read on to see some of the dynamics shaping alternative cryptocurrencies today.  Ironbankcoin seeks to build blockchain-based strategy game  An altcoin is looking to establish what it calls a “24/7 global game of Risk”, with the block chain serving as the basis for player action during the game.  Ironbankcoin is partnering with Blockchain Technology Group, a cryptocurrency technology firm that specializes in designing and managing digital currencies. Blocktech will manage the ironbankcoin network while the development team for the game handle the design and implementation of the game platform.  According to the alt’s official Bitcoin Talk post, ironbankcoin will function as an ownership token for the game – the more IBC you hold, the more land you own. Yet, because the alt will be traded and exchanged in active markets, the value of that “land” is very much at play. Finally, the coin will function as an in-game currency as well.  The development team noted on Bitcoin Talk:  “Have you ever wanted a coin that doesn't need to be tied to BTC? An economy made from a ""game"", but a game that can make you more of the currency. The land will have value in IBC and that is what the marketcap can be tied to. Easy to defend a small portion of land for small profits. Near impossible to rule a kingdom alone. Who can you trust to help you rule?”  The comments above imply that the game will require cooperation and intrigue between players. While the announcement did not contain specific details about the nature of the gaming platform, the development team told CoinDesk that it will focus on kingdom management, diplomacy and economic management.  Ironbankcoin is currently holding an initial coin offering (ICO), offering 50 percent of the coin’s 100 million coin supply during a seven-day pre-launch sale. According to the development team, coins will be distributed on a proportional basis depending on the amount of BTC received during the sale.  SYNC expands asset list, launches new wallet  SYNC is a curious entry in the lexicon of alternative cryptocurrencies, building its value proposition on a membership structure that offers several levels of potential return for investors.  Several weeks ago the SYNC community made waves in the markets when it announced SYNC Assets, a portfolio of digital assets that includes domain names and prominent cryptocurrencies.  For those who meet the requirements, proceeds from asset sales are distributed proportionally to eligible members.  Since the SYNC Assets launch, the team has built the list of domain names it controls and has continued to push value-added features such as airline miles and discounts exclusively for SYNC holders.  CoinDesk spoke with SYNC Foundation co-founder Mike Fiol, who said that the fundamental purpose of SYNC is to give individuals an entry point into crypto-investment with a vehicle that seeks greater stability compared to other available coins.  Fiol explained that beyond that, the goal of the project is to give investors a way to avoid some of the problems associated with altcoin markets, including projects that turn out to be fraudulent in nature.  He said:  “We’re trying to create something that has some tangible value to it. It was a response to all the scams going on, a response to the realization that anyone can work on a coin.”  One of the projects under development is the creation of a mobile app that will allow SYNC owners to tap a range of discounts and consumer benefits. According to Fiol, the app will enable SYNC investors to find businesses nearby that offer these benefits. Notably, inclusion in the membership program requires owning at least one SYNC, which at press time costs an average of 1.2 BTC across all exchanges.  Fiol summed it up:  “If you use it correctly, you can save outrageous amounts of money.”  Two percent of proceeds from the Foundation’s asset and coin sales are directed to a program called SYNC Kids. This initiative devotes funds to the Spenser Somers Foundation, a non-profit organization which sponsors a Ronald McDonald House children's charity center in Minneapolis.  Looking ahead, the SYNC team recently released a new wallet and is looking to continue expanding on its existing services. Fiol hinted at upcoming releases that will expand the scope of usability for SYNC.  Educational initiative for altcoin trading takes shape  The altcoin world owes much of its existence to the diverse community of investors, traders and Twitter pundits fueling speculation and exchange in the marketplaces. While some bring years of experience in traditional financial and asset markets to the crypto realm, there are others who enter the environment with little idea of where to begin.  Ivyleaguecoin  , a new altcoin initiative, aims to provide a vehicle for novice investors to gain insights into the nature of buying, selling and trading.  CoinDesk spoke with the ivyleaguecoin organizer, who said that the goal is to provide a platform for people to gain perspective on the various aspects of trading on a level that is comfortable for them. The planned courses will be structured in several tiers and include resource documents, live webinars and one-on-one instruction.  No pricing information is yet available, but an ICO is planned that could raise as much as 2 BTC to pay for platform development and instructor compensation. The organizer told CoinDesk that participation in the tiers will require varied pay scales, saying:  “Each tier will have different cost and include some coins. The intro level will be basic documents to start a user if they don’t feel the need for live training. The novice and advanced [levels] will have live training sessions to better help people understand what they see and where.”  The team behind ivyleaguecoin has yet to reveal an initial launch date, but with a planned two week-long ICO period, the program may not go live until next month at the earliest.  Strange alt of the week  Here on All Things Alt, we’ve covered our fair share of bizarrely branded coins. For better or for worse, some development teams choose potentially copyright-protected properties and attempt to build cryptocurrency network.  Lemurcoin  continues this proud tradition by using popular characters from the DreamWorks Animation film series Madagascar, including the character “King Coolian” who is embossed on the coin’s official logo. The film collection focuses on a group of animals who find themselves thrown into wacky adventures around the globe, and the broader franchise itself has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in global revenue.  For this appraoch, lemurcoin has won this week’s Strange Alt of the Week award.  As an altcoin itself, lemurcoin is pitched as a low-supply investment opportunity tied to, according to its official Bitcoin Talk post, the number of lemurs alive in the world.  The post reads:  “[The] value of lemurs in the world fauna is very high; smart, uncharted and mysterious creatures of the world. King Coolian believes their coin deserves same high value!”  The development team has a number of proposed initiatives in mind, most notably a Madagascar-focused airdrop. The announcement post explores the question of whether or not the currency could act as a so-called country coin like auroracoin, saying:  “Is lemurcoin an official cryptocurrency of Madagascar? Huh, what kinda questions is that, sure it is! His Countryness King Coolian himself said so!”  The coin is expected to fully launch on 17th August.

42377543,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71o8j,1408130410,Did Margin Trading Crash the Price of Bitcoin?,"The price of bitcoin declined to its lowest level since May yesterday, falling nearly 10% and ending what had been a long period of relative optimism and stability for the global bitcoin market.  But while there were many theories as to what news events could have caused bitcoin's value to fall into such a steep decline, some market observers believe that this most recent movement may have been caused not by external factors, but by the actions of bitcoin traders.  This theory, perhaps most notably posed by Raffael Danielli, posits that out-of-control margin trading caused a flash crash in at least one major bitcoin exchange market, a development that had a cascading effect across the larger bitcoin market.  In the post on his quantitative analysis blog Matlab Trading, Danielli asserts that margin traders, specifically those on Hong Kong-based bitcoin trading platform Bitfinex, had invested significant funds into long positions as bullish sentiment rose in July.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Danielli elaborated on his post, suggesting that initial positive sentiment about New York's proposed bitcoin regulation had a profound impact on the digital currency trading community, but that it was how investors acted on this information that proved problematic.  Danielli explained:  ""[Positive sentiment about US regulation] resulted in large buying activities and traders on Bitfinex started to borrow as much money as they [could] to buy more bitcoins and increase their position in anticipation of a market upswing. As it turned out, New York’s proposed bitcoin regulations are more on the harsh side and the European banking authority also decided to take a very cautious approach.""  He concluded: ""In other words, many traders were caught on the wrong foot and today they paid the price.""  The rise of bitcoin margin trading  Margin tradinghttps://www.bitfinex.com/pages/howitworks  allows investors to borrow money from brokers, funds that are then leveraged by borrowers to trade on the outlook of bitcoin. Borrowers can then place bets on how they believe the market will perform, going either 'long' or 'short' depending on whether they think the price of the asset will rise (long) or fall (short).  When margin traders close their position, they return the original principal to the investor, plus any agreed upon interest, and the borrower is assessed a profit or a loss.  While a mainstay of major traditional markets, margin trading is relatively new to the bitcoin ecosystem. China's largest bitcoin exchange OKCoin introduced its margin trading service this June, while Bitfinex opened its offering in June of 2013. BTC-e, another major Europe-based exchange, also offers the service.  Though he is a critic of margin trading, Danielli was quick to point out that the practice is not something that's unique to the bitcoin ecosystem.  ""All major exchanges in the world such as NASDAQ, NYSE and BATS have to deal with similar events like the one we observed today.""  Proponents of margin trading assert that the trading option provides experienced investors with the chance to gain significant profits, provided they properly gauge the risks associated with their borrowing.  Bullish sentiment builds  Danielli suggested that news was a factor in yesterday's price decline but only in how it influenced overall trading activities and investor sentiment. Still, his statements illustrate how these factors can prove to be a powerful combination.  He argued that traders rushed to place long bets after the release of New York's BitLicense proposal, but that as the narrative surrounding the regulation soured, the positions placed during this period of optimism were left in limbo.  Further, a number of smaller news events compounded, he said, slowly weakening optimism about the market.  Danielli cited the news that certain recipients of the Ethereum project funds could sell roughly 2,600 BTC (roughly $1.2m at press time) raised in its initial bitcoin fundraising, and concern over increased merchant adoption as factors that influenced traders.  ""Many traders were caught in large, leveraged, long positions entered in mid-July around $600 to $640 as can be seen from the change in open swap positions,"" Danielli said, adding:  ""It was just a question of time until those traders would hit the margin call if prices continued to drop.""  Crash in motion  This trend, Danielli argues, came to head at roughly 1:00am UTC on 14th August with one large sale order on Bitstamp that caused 500 BTC to be sold in one minute, pushing the price down to $525.  Prices on Bitstamp and Bitfinex began to decline, and as the price of bitcoin on these exchanges neared $520, a ""breaking point"" was hit, he said.  ""After this point, Bitfinex started to liquidate positions of traders who could not cover their margin anymore and selling their positions in the open market,"" he continued. ""This increased downward momentum and subsequently more traders got hit with margin calls.""  This, Danielli asserts, caused the price to crash to $451 on Bitfinex before the markets could recover. However, Bitfinex offered a different take on the events.  Margin trading exchanges respond  Given this belief that margin trading likely contributed to the decline of bitcoin's price, CoinDesk reached out to the major exchange platforms that offer the service, with only one exchange, Bitfinex, responding to requests for comment.  Bitfinex management told CoinDesk it remains confident in its service, saying that ultimately, the responsibility for trading activity lies with the bitcoin community, who must understand the risks involved with margin trading. The exchange framed itself as a service provider, and that far from being a contributing factor, its procedures actually prevented larger market losses.  Bitfinex said:  ""In this particular instance, we had two extremely large, unforced, market sell orders come in one after another. While there were some forced liquidations, it was not the majority of the trading activity around that time.""  Bitfinex argued that, despite some claims in the community, it does have such safeguards in place to help stop such harmful actions on its market, and that its platform actually prevented a more extreme flash crash in this instance.  Bitfinex said:  ""All systems performed nominally and according to design. We were very pleased to see that our hard efforts in improving our risk management technology and process yielded an orderly result.""  Short positions increase  Speaking to CoinDesk, other market observers suggest there may have been more malicious activities that contributed to the price crash, and that neither the exchanges offering the service or the involved traders may have been a factor in yesterday's events.  Jonathan Levin  , chief executive at Coinometrics, an analytics firm seeking to promote digital currency exchange transparency, is more skeptical that the trading was the result of news pressures.  Levin said:  ""It was quite clear that what triggered the flash crash was a series of margin calls being closed out [...] but the question is, who was doing it? Was it market manipulation or was it literally just a big position being closed out?""  Levin has performed a preliminary analysis that shows plenty of profit was realised during the flash crash, and that there were clear warning signs that a big price dip was imminent. Levin pointed out that the volume of bitcoin swaps on Bitfinex grew sharply two days before the crash.  Swaps are a tool offered by the exchange to allow owners of assets, like bitcoin holdings, to loan them out for a return. The loaned assets can be used for leveraged trades as well as for short-selling. A short seller would borrow bitcoin using a swap and then sell that bitcoin for US dollars, Arthur Hayes, CEO of BitMEX, said.  The increased bitcoin swap activity suggests that traders were able to take short positions ahead of the flash crash, therefore profiting from the plunge in price.  Link remains unclear  But the link between the rise in short positions and the eventual trigger for the flash crash – the two big sale orders – is open to interpretation for now.  ""Could it be that someone had insider information on these long positions? I don't know,"" Levin said.  A skillful trader with sufficient resources could also have spotted that market conditions were ripe for an adventurous short to make a killing on the market, according to Hayes, who added:  ""Savvy traders try and sniff out where the margin call trigger levels are and push the price down to trigger margin calls and cover their short at lower prices.""  While Levin said that he prefers not to speculate whether market manipulation was behind the flash crash, he noted that the spike in bitcoin swaps on the exchange was a warning signal that investors should have heeded.  ""The chart with the shorts coming in, I think that's a warning signal. That should have warned the market,"" he said.  Alternative theories  Still, Hayes believes that a confluence of factors created the conditions for the flash crash, not least of which was the summer holiday season.  ""The new marginal buy and holder of bitcoin is probably on a beach or family vacation somewhere,"" he said.  While traders were on vacation, order books remained thin, creating the conditions for big price swings if a relatively large sell order landed on the market, Hayes said.  Hayes also pointed to growing merchant acceptance of bitcoin as a reason for an increased supply of coins, as merchants immediately exchanged the digital currency that customers handed them to fiat. Miners, who needed to regularly exchange bitcoin for fiat to ""pay their bills"" were another reason for selling pressure on the digital currency, Hayes said.  Jean Marie-Mognetti  , a director at Global Advisors, a bitcoin hedge fund, went even further afield to describe the factors responsible for the flash crash, saying:  ""Rather than looking at bitcoin in isolation, it's important to consider it in light of broader macroeconomic factors.""  Mognetti pointed to a number of concerns in Europe that have weakened the bitcoin price outlook, noting that there were concerns over Germany's GDP growth, lingering worry over a eurozone recovery and a Russian ban on imports that could be ratcheting up geo-political tensions. Commodities like crude oil, natural gas and copper have also declined in price, he noted.  ""In such an environment, conditions for a bitcoin rally don't seem to be in place. Holders of bitcoin may feel inclined to reduce their risk profile,"" he said.  CoinDesk contacted OKCoin and BTC-e for comment on this piece, but did not receive an immediate response.

Biteasy  is the startup behind an API that lets developers pull transaction data directly from the bitcoin block chain. The company recently submitted a GitHub pull request to DuckDuckGo, allowing the code to provide expanded block chain data access for search engine users. Previously, DuckDuckGo could be used to access wallet balance information, a feature added  On 12th August, Biteasy announced that the DuckDuckGo API integration is complete. The company said the onboarding of the API is a collaborative process and that communication is open and positive between the two platforms.  The move reflects a growing trend in the search engine ecosystem of displaying relevant bitcoin information. In the past few months, search giants Google and Yahoo! have also tapped the block chain for price data distribution.  A representative for Biteasy told CoinDesk:  “They showed interest and enthusiasm from the start. They were really helpful with their suggestions and we think it worked out fine for both of us. We really loved working with them in order to complete this task and we are looking forward to do so again in the future.”  Simple interface  As the images below show, the DuckDuckGo integration allows users of the private search engine to look at transaction data and wallet information.  The information provided mirrors data available from platforms like Blockchain. Users can see a block’s size, its difficulty and the associated fees. The search engine took a different approach compared to the services offered by Google and Yahoo!, providing network data rather than information about prices.  Biteasy told CoinDesk that it’s possible the DuckDuckGo integration could be a model for how search engines create intuitive environments for accessing block chain information, saying:  “DuckDuckGo bitcoin users will not have to leave their favorite search tool in order to check their balances or pending transactions. Hopefully other search engines will follow suit.”  Biteasy added that it will be expanding on its services in the future, providing more in-depth block chain data that can be integrated via its open-source API.

42377537,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71o1B,1408110568,Hackers Steal $1.65 Million in NXT from BTER Exchange,"UPDATE (15th August 17:20 BST): According to reports from the NXT community and BTER, a rollback is no longer being actively considered. BTER announced on Twitter that it would seek to retrieve the stolen funds through other means.  The company said:    We have decided not to rollback but get the stolen funds back from the hacker since we have got lots of information of him.      — Bter.com Exchange (@btercom) August 15, 2014      Update (15th August 22:15 BST): Updated with feedback from NXTOrganization.      BTER is reporting that 50m NXT, or roughly $1.65m at press time, has been stolen from its exchange following an attack on one of its hosting servers.  A developer representing the China-based digital currency exchange platform confirmed the news on the community information website NXT Forum, suggesting that the BTER team was considering urging the NXT community to roll back the NXT block chain to recover the lost funds.  In a post to the community, developer 'freeworm' revealed the gravity of the situation for both the exchange and the NXT community, saying:  ""It's totally our fault and we are trying our best to cover all the loss. However, 50m nxt is huge for us, we cannot afford it at the moment.""  Freeworm continued his post by providing the address containing the stolen 51,670,000 NXT, and detailing how it would seek to enlist the help of the NXT community in its effort to recover its funds.  The BTER representative suggested that the exchange is exploring all options, including contacting the NXT development team in an effort to rollback the block chain, thereby restoring the ledger to its state before the theft occurred.  However, NXTOrganization confirmed that a signifcant majority of forgers opposed the plan when it was proposed as part of a client update.  ""Most NXT users report only seeing a few 1.2.5b nodes. This would suggest that most of the community decided to go against the roll back even under the extreme pressure of such a large theft,"" a spokesperson said.  BTER also revealed the news on Twitter:    Someone hacked Bter's NXT central account and stole 50m NXT. We are working with the dev for a plan. We will keep you updated.      — Bter.com Exchange (@btercom) August 15, 2014    Latest block chain rollback  The block chain rollback proposal, while still only in its early stages, would follow vericoin's decision to reset its internal ledger in July. That decision occurred after 8m VRC were lost in an attack on digital currency exchange MintPal.  While successfully avoiding the theft, the decision also sparked controversy within the altcoin community, with litecoin creator Charlie Lee speaking out against the decision and reassuring his community and its investors that it would not seek a similar solution in the event of large theft.  NXT was initially listed on BTER in January amid excitement about the then-new community. The second-generation cryptocurrency uses a version of Proof of Stake (PoS) for its algorithm, awarding the NXT collected from transaction fees in the last block to forgers for continuing to hold NXT.  Notably, vericoin cited its own PoS mining system as a key reason for its rollback. By not restoring the block chain to its previous state, many argued, the thief may have been rewarded for continuing to hold the confiscated funds.  Community reaction  At press time, many NXT Forum members were supportive of the idea of a rollback, though at least one member suggested that time was of the essence should the community look to pursue the fix.  Forum member 'Come-from-Beyond' suggested that the decision to revert NXT's block chain would need to take place before 720 new blocks had been successfully processed by the community.  Other NXT exchanges also responded to news of the hack, with Poloniex freezing its NXT/BTC market.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.

42377523,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71nob,1408102799,New Altcoin Promotes Fitness with 'Proof of Sweat',"Mining bitcoins chews up a lot of computing power for no other purpose than to sustain the network. Wouldn’t it be useful to mine cryptocurrency in some other, more productive way?      Now a team of Serbian developers has tried to crack the problem with a proof-of-concept altcoin that lets you mine coins simply by exercising.      Mangocoinz was launched as a computer science project by three students at Belgrade's School of Computing, with a simple concept: instead of using computational work to generate coins, miners have to do some actual, physical work.      For example, repeatedly moving a smartphone (typically by walking or jogging) will result in 'proof of work', which the client software will turn into a portion of a coin.      While the coin is still in its very early days and problems remain to be ironed out, the concept may hold promise as a tool for institutions promoting fitness or as a way to lower health insurance premiums.    Useful proof of work    Mangocoinz is the latest idea in a long-running quest to make proof-of-work models that do more than simply crank out coins. Some have been frankly bizarre: bumbacoin, for example, bafflingly enables people to ‘mine’ coins by trolling newsgroups with Jamaican expletives.      Some attempts have stuck with computation, but have tried to make the computations scientifically useful. Primecoin solves prime numbers while mining coins, for example.      Peercoin, by the same developer, uses proof of stake, at least in part, which mines coins based on how many a person already owns, in an attempt to cut computing cycles and experiment with economics.      Another alternative, gridcoin, rewards people for useful research. Its users still crank out compute cycles, but they use them for crowdsourced scientific computing projects such as SETI@home. Gridcoins are tokens proving that their computers did that work.      All of these projects, even ridiculous ones like bumbacoin, have one thing in common: they involve some kind of effort on the miner’s part.    “There are many kinds of proofs-of-work. All have their trade-offs. We discover more new ideas/avenues every day,” said core bitcoin protocol developer Jeff Garzik. “The general idea is that copying digital data is trivial and frictionless. You must discover a method to make that process slower, more difficult.”    If a proof of work is simply about effort, then a physical proof should theoretically be possible. Running entails a measurable effort, which has a positive fitness effect.    The 'washing machine attack'    There are problems with the idea, though. It would seem trivially easy to game this system so that you didn’t have to work at it – and the cost of attack is very low. Putting the phone on a washing machine during the spin cycle might do it. Theoretically, you could make yourself a mangocoinz millionaire and get a nice, fresh-smelling pair of socks at the same time, for a double win.      The trio’s answer for that involves a daily mining limit of 10 mangocoinz (MCZ) per day, verified using a centralized, cloud-based service.      “Coins only become valid when you sync them,” said the company’s founders, who declined to give their full names. “If you mine three coins a day and click sync, you make three coins valid and [can send them] to anyone you like, and you have seven coins left to mine in the day. Then it resets.”      With no rollovers, that places a limit on the profit that anyone could make per day. However, were mangocoinz ever to gain sufficient real-world value to make them interesting, people could still game the system.      Attackers could generate multiple accounts, using phones on washing-machines or hacked clients, and continue to mine coins to the limit. That would raise the mining difficulty, and penalize people who were trying to mine the coins legitimately by working out.    Mitigating hacks    A technical solution to that problem would be difficult. Theoretically, the software could use the GPS to check for a change in geographical position while the coins are being mined, to check that the miner is really walking or running. But that would penalize those using a treadmill or exercise bike at home.      A better alternative might be to marry the accelerometer to the kind of heart monitor expected to be incorporated into wearable devices like Motorola’s Moto360 smart watch. Google’s Fit software development kit is already out in preview form, for developers to play with.      However, this brings us back to the same problem: all of these signals could be falsified using software hacks. And this in turn boils down to a fundamental design characteristic: mangocoinz mining and transactions are validated by a centrally-managed server. The system does not use a decentralized network to cryptographically verify the proof of work as bitcoin does.      “We made the system for honest people,” say the founders. Well, quite, but the Internet is full of scam artists and tricksters who will quickly subvert such a system at the cost of those honest users.    A matter of trust    To take a nascent project like mangocoinz to the next level, it may be necessary to revamp its trust model.      Honesty and trust are difficult to codify, but it is possible, believes Jesse Heaslip, a board member at digital currency innovation and branding lab Humint. A big believer in the use of cryptocurrency for social good, Heaslip muses about reputation systems.      If the network could be seeded with trusted nodes – the “honest people” that mangocoinz’ founders describe – then perhaps they could be used to raise the reputation of other nodes that run with them, Heaslip suggested, adding:      “You’d have to build a group dynamic into it. So before you were trusted individually, you’d run in a group.”              He also suggested getting institutional support to launch a coin with potential health benefits to greater heights. “Who’s going to get the value from performing the exercises? You have to throw it to a government or health insurance provider,” he said.      Such an organization might be able to prove that exercise reduces overall healthcare costs by a certain amount.      “You can prove that people exercise that certain amount, which reduces your insurance costs. Thereby you should contribute this much to the project to ensure that it goes,” he concludes.      These concepts are far beyond where mangocoinz is today, but its founders say they have received inquiries from more than one technology accelerator, indicating that there is some interest.

The addition of Bangladesh means the Bitcoin Foundation has built an international chain of affiliates in just eight months. The newest member joins groups in Canada, Mexico, Australia, Germany, Denmark and Netherlands.  The president of Bitcoin Foundation Bangladesh, Sazeeb (no last name given), said:  ""To be effective in positively improving lives, it's important we join together, align our goals, become educated and coordinate our efforts to encourage bitcoin’s adoption.”  The Bangladesh team  An entrepreneur, motivational singer and musician, Sazeeb has been the driving force behind the new foundation chapter, with support from international bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver, who appears on the group's site as an official advisor.  Also on the Bangladesh board are local entrepreneurs Sadia Sultana Mou, Mizanur Rahman, and Jamil (no last name given).  ""Our mission is to help people utilize the best solutions to help make their life easier,"" the group's website states.  While there are plenty of great opportunities in the marketplace, it continues, the right approach is needed to deliver the bitcoin message to that part of society who need its answers most. Bitcoin has the potential to dominate the entire payments industry, it adds.  Sazeeb is currently in the process of setting up websites to educate locals about bitcoin and the benefits it can bring. He has already formed an affiliate marketing program, Coinpiler, which pays its rewards in bitcoin.  Why affiliate?  The international Bitcoin Foundation has been hosting a series of informational webinars for other groups interested in becoming affiliateshttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/affiliates/.  Affiliate Director Mark Woods espoused the benefits of formal links with the Foundation for new bitcoin organizations, as opposed to spending the energy and resources required to build those structures from the ground up.  He said:  ""As the leading and first member driven nonprofit digital trade organization in the world, our affiliates take on an active and important leadership role as part of a global conversation and movement. We are more effective working together, sharing information, resources and ideas as a united and coordinated front.""  Affiliating with the Foundation provided the membership platform, educational collateral, sub-domain, email accounts and even hosted websites, he added, to make it easy to get started so new groups can focus on what's really important – outreach and education.  There were also Bangladesh's specific needs that the Bitcoin Foundation had identified and cooperated in preparing an agenda.  ""The Bangladesh leadership team plans to put a major emphasis on education to encourage bitcoin's adoption. We will be providing bitcoin education and resources in Bengali, the official language as well as support a local outreach campaigns.""  Bitcoin in Bangladesh  Bangladesh is the eighth most populated country in the world, with over 150 million people. Although still considered a 'developing country', it has an open and market-based economy driven mainly by agriculture and large-scale manufacturing industries.  As is the case with neighboring India and the Philippines, Bangladesh counts on remittances from foreign-based workers and even local employees sending money from large cities to small towns as a significant contributor to its GDP. Estimates put income from remittances in 2012-2013 at $14.5bn.  This would be an obvious use case for digital currency, though the usual hurdles of technology adoption, infrastructure costs and general awareness would need to be addressed, plus the need for affordable and reliable fiat currency to bitcoin gateways that exists in all countries.

42377528,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71ntd,1408068735,PayPal Subsidiary Braintree in Talks with Coinbase to Accept Bitcoin,"Payments firm Braintree, a subsidiary of eBay and PayPal, is ""in talks"" with Coinbase and several other processing companies on the possibility of accepting bitcoin, according to a Wall Street Journal report.  Braintree  provides payments software for a number of popular mobile applications including Uber, Airbnb, and GitHub. The company, which was acquired by PayPal for $800m in December last year, was processing up to $12bn in payments annually at the time – $4bn of that via mobile apps.  No matter which bitcoin processor Braintree may choose, accepting digital currency would represent another significant step in bitcoin's lifecycle.  ""People familiar with the matter"" stressed that any deal would not include either eBay or PayPal accepting bitcoin for now, though senior executives including eBay CEO John Donahoe have at times expressed an interest in ways to accept digital currencies, even describing it as ""inevitable"".  Anyone who doubted the seriousness of those comments in the media may be swayed if a partner business as close as Braintree began accepting bitcoin, demonstrating its utility on a slightly smaller scale than the two online giants. It could also represent a foot in the door for future acceptance.  Partners in disruption  Both Uber and Airbnb have much in common with bitcoin. The startups have been lauded by supporters in the technology world for their disruption of the taxi and hotel industry, though they have also encountered stiff opposition from established participants in those segments.  Thanks to its formal partnership with PayPal, also an eBay subsiduary, Braintree now serves 40 countries and 130 different currencies.  Founded in 2007 by entrepreneur Bryan Johnson, Braintree raised $34m in Series A investment from Accel Partners in 2011, and a further $35m led by NEA in 2012, before its eventual acquisition.  It provides a solution for mobile based and other online businesses to accept credit card payments directly from their apps and sites, supplying both the payment processor and merchant account in one package.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/15/paypal-subsidiary-braintree-in-talks-with-coinbase-to-accept-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6ea786bd4e6ced8fbea982fd1cb29273b38e635-1378x1378.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
