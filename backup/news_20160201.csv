42426630,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuoNh,1454367904,UNICEF Innovation Fund Hints at Blockchain Investments,"The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has hinted at possible investments in blockchain startups or initiatives.  UNICEF, founded in 1946, is dedicated to promoting humanitarian efforts aimed at supporting children and families living in impoverished regions. The organization announced today it is accepting applications for investment from its Innovation Fund, launched in May of last year.  The organization said that the fund is focused on three areas for investment: learning products, real-time information delivery and ""infrastructure to increase access to services and information"".  In a statement, Christopher Fabian, who co-leads UNICEF’s innovation efforts, suggested that projects focusing on the blockchain could receive support from the fund, which has raised $9m to date.  Fabian said:  ""These three areas are ripe for investment due to rapidly changing technologies such as blockchain, 3-D printing, wearables and sensors, artificial intelligence and renewable energy.""  To qualify for the program, applicants must have open-source, prototype-stage products.  The deadline for submissions is 26th February. UNICEF declined to comment when reached.

42426623,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuoDh,1454364006,Corrupt Silk Road Agent Arrested in Alleged Attempt to Flee Country,"A former Secret Service agent who pleaded guilty to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin during the US government’s investigation of the now-defunct dark market Silk Road has been re-arrested.  Court documents point to a suspicion on the part of the federal government that Shaun Bridges may have been attempting to flee the country.  In a 28th January document, prosecutors sought to prevent the court from approving Bridges’ request to be allowed to surrender to a Bureau of Prisons facility in the state of New Hampshire. Judge Richard Seeborg approved that order on 29th January.  Prosecutors say the arresting officers discovered passports for Bridges, documents pertaining to offshore companies based in Belize, Mauritius and Nevis, and a bulletproof vest.  The filing goes on to explain:  ""Also located in those bags were documents relating to his wife’s, Ariana Esposito’s, attempts to obtain citizenship in another country. Government agents also found a MacBook with the serial number scratched off, an [iPad] tucked between a bedroom mattress and bulletproof vests, at least one of which had Secret Service markings and thus is believed to have been stolen from the government.""  According to the prosecution, Bridges was arrested ""without incident"" last Thursday. As reported by The Baltimore Sun, he was arrested at his home in Laurel, Maryland.  Bridges was sentenced in December after pleading guilty to money laundering and obstruction of justice charges. Bridges was accused of stealing more than $820,000 from bitcoin accounts tied to the Silk Road.  Alongside former Drug Enforcement Agency agent Carl Mark Force IV, Bridges was arrested in the midst of the trial of convicted Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht, who is now appealing his life sentence in part because of the court’s efforts to restrict access to this information during the trial.

42426635,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuoXh,1454356255,Japan’s Largest Bank Latest to Develop Own Digital Currency,"Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG) has revealed that it has developed its own digital currency nicknamed “MUFG coin” as part of its research into blockchain and distributed ledger technology.  According to The Asahi Shimbun, the digital currency project seeks to replicate the peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange and mobile wallet functionality inherent in bitcoin, but without relying on the bitcoin blockchain’s distributed network of miners.  MUFG began the trial last fall, which is aimed at decreasing the costs of managing financial transactions, particularly in the case of P2P transfer and remittances.  Representatives from MUFG subsidiary BTMU confirmed the trial to CoinDesk, though they did not provide additional details when reached.  The announcement is reminiscent of Citi’s July revelation that it had created a proprietary network termed ""Citicoin"" on which it was conducting experiments and comes amid an increasing period of activity from both commercial and Japanese banks.  SBI Holdings  , for instance, announced this week the creation of a new company with distributed ledger startup Ripple, as well as an investment in bitcoin exchange Kraken. Meanwhile, MUFG competitors including Barclays, BBVA and Banco Santander have all made recent announcements on the subject.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group had previously been revealed as a member of blockchain technology consortium R3CEV, which has enrolled 42 global banks into its program and is expanding to include non-banks.

42426646,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJuoph,1454351643,BAFT Event Attendees See Future With Billions of Blockchains,"A new survey shows financial professionals are increasingly bullish on blockchain and distributed ledger tech, even as they profess to a lack of understanding of the subject matter.  Conducted by think tank and distributed ledger specialist Z/Yen Group at the Bankers' Association for Finance and Trade (BAFT) Global Annual Meeting in Paris this January, the poll found that while 70% of respondents said the financial institution they work for is exploring the technology, 69% reported they don't believe they have a ""good grasp"" of how it works.  Overall, 73% of respondents reported they had more than 15 years experience in the industry, with the majority working in either a business executive (44%) or product development (46%) role. Just 6% indicated they were responsible for their institution's technology offerings.  Of note was that respondents demonstrated that they believe in a future where there is more than just one central distributed ledger, with just 3% indicating they think a technology like the bitcoin blockchain could serve this function.  Sixty-four percent of survey takers voiced their opinion that there will be thousands or millions of blockchains (48%) or more than 1 billion (16%).  Underscoring this idea is that 71% believe the secure financial telecommunications platform SWIFT believe the service should be extended through the use of distributed ledger tech, with just 18% suggesting the technology would serve as a replacement.  Elsewhere, the survey examined topics such as the perceived impact of regulation on financial technology efforts and the effectiveness of current methods of combatting cybercrime, among other topics.

While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Kraken said that a ""multi-million dollar"" investment had been agreed upon with SBI. Kraken did not say when it expected the Series B round to be completed.  ""It’s a fantastic first step toward completing Series B, which will ultimately enable us to scale our business worldwide,"" said Kraken CEO Jesse Powell.  SBI Investment is the venture capital arm of SBI Holdings, an Internet-based financial group that reported an operating revenue of roughly $2bn in 2015. The firm recently announced that it would work with Ripple to establish a new company with a focus on Asian markets.  The announcement comes shortly after Kraken disclosed that it was acquiring New York bitcoin exchange Coinsetter in an undisclosed deal.  Kraken closed a Series A funding round in March 2014, raising $5m in a round led by Hummingbird Ventures, an early-phase venture capital firm.

42378578,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ifKn,1454335292,JPMorgan Partners With Digital Asset for Blockchain Trial,"JPMorgan Chase has teamed up with Digital Asset Holdings on a trial blockchain initiative that aims to make the trading process more efficient and cost effective.  As reported in the FT, several uses of the technology are to be examined, including addressing liquidity mismatches in loan funds.  These funds give investors quick access to money, although the underlying assets often take far longer to sell due to a complex manual process that must deal with multiple parties.  ""To sell a loan is a very cumbersome, time-consuming process; settlement can take weeks,"" Daniel Pinto, CEO at JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, told the FT. Using the blockchain makes sense, since it’s easier and faster, and produces fewer errors, he said.  New York-based Digital Asset seeks to use private or permissioned blockchain technology to streamline syndicated loans, US Treasury repo, foreign exchange, securities settlement, and derivatives.  Led by Blythe Masters, JPMorgan's former head of commodities, the firm recently raised at least $50m from 13 major financial institutions, including Citi, CME Ventures and Santander InnoVentures.  Masters told the FT that speeding up settlement would lead to ""reduced capital requirements, lower operational costs and an improved client experience"".

42378587,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ifXN,1454326950,Why Bitcoin and Blockchain Are Just Getting Started,"What is Bitcoin good for, if not an occasional dose of drama?  Readers of the recent New York Time piece, ""The Bitcoin Believer Who Gave Up"", have been rightfully concerned about the future of bitcoin. But there remains much more promise for bitcoin and blockchain than readers might glean from this single snapshot.  Yes, there are significant technical and governance challenges for scaling bitcoin. The number of transactions the network can process today is far too low and the security and software development concentrated in too few hands.  None of the concerns raised by developer Mike Hearn in his farewell message (to bitcoin specifically; he is now working full-time for the blockchain consortium R3CEV) are news to those who have been following bitcoin closely.  However, these challenges should be seen as symptoms of bitcoin’s amazing success to date rather than its imminent demise. In barely seven years of existence, bitcoin has moved from a fringe technology for libertarians and drug dealers to a commodity valued at over $5bn (with a 'B'), the basis of over $1bn in venture capital investment.  Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology are the focus of R&D efforts by nearly every major financial services company, the MIT Media Lab, and the UK government.  Just last week, Digital Asset Holdings announced a $52m fundraise from some of the biggest players on Wall Street, as well as revealing the selection of their blockchain-based software as the new infrastructure for the Australian Securities Exchange.  All the problems Hearn cites have arisen because more and more people and institutions want to use bitcoin; they are more like growing pains than a death knell.  Growing ecosystem  Despite the current challenges, we still believe bitcoin and blockchain hold as much promise as they did a year ago when we decided to start the Bits + Blocks coLAB.  Once you’ve seen the power of a peer-to-peer digital currency and permissionless payment network, it’s hard to unsee them. Bitcoin has opened our eyes and created new expectations for the ways we store and transfer value of all kinds.  While we believe in bitcoin specifically, we also see it as just one piece of a growing ecosystem of distributed systems, shared ledgers, and cryptographic technology which will have a profound impact on how we interact, transact, and communicate with each other.  Bitcoin may eventually fail to live up to the potential we see for it, but it is certainly ripe with learning and worthy of our attention. We are still inspired by the vast potential of blockchain technology to foster new forms of trust and exchange.  Our most recent research into how these technologies might enable new digital identity systems left us feeling more confident than ever that blockchains are powerful tools that will lead to the creation of great new experiences.  Bitcoin has been declared dead many times before, something that should come as no surprise, given it is a very early-stage technology that has already taken a couple steep rides up and down the hype cycle.  Much like the evolution of the internet starting with TCP/IP protocols that have resulted in the web we use today, the revolutionary changes made possible by bitcoin and blockchain will likely take at least five to 10 years to begin to reach their potential.
