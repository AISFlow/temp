42409415,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHHrh,1700609806,Binance's CZ and the End of the 'Borderless' Crypto Company,"Tuesday marks the end of an era. Binance's Changpeng Zhao stepped down and pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering requirements, despite the fact that Binance was never a U.S. exchange. With that, the myth of “borderless” crypto companies is truly over.  To be sure, this is not the first time that U.S. law enforcement nailed a crypto exchange that was not officially in the country. The same thing happened with FTX. But no company exemplified the “borderless” myth more than Binance, which will also pay a $4.3 billion dollar fine to settle an investigation from the U.S. Department of Justice.  Binance defied the boundaries of a traditional company. It served traders everywhere, eventually becoming the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and yet for a long time no one seemed to know where it was located. The very idea of a headquarters was antithetical to Binance’s whole identity.  In 2018, I asked CZ where he was based. “People still have this really strong concept of where your company is, and where you are,” he told me at the time. “A company is a concept. An organization is a concept.” When I asked where he called home, he just said, “I don’t really have any answer to that. Earth?”  Binance made a point of not being based in the United States, outside of its much smaller U.S. entity, Binance.US. I can’t remember the last time CZ publicly appeared on American soil. But the company was clearly not exempt from U.S. law. The United States accused Binance of not having a proper anti-money laundering (AML) program, of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and of violating sanctions law, CoinDesk reported.  “Binance became the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed — now it’s paying one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have also taken enforcement actions against Binance. The overall theme of the allegations is that Binance had U.S. customers, told those customers how to avoid U.S. regulations and took steps to hide their activity from U.S. regulators.  Some in the crypto community criticize the long arm of U.S. law. Binance itself pushed back against the CFTC in a filing in a U.S. court, saying, “U.S. law governs domestically but does not control the world.”  U.S. law might disagree. In 2022, BitMEX founders pled guilty to violating U.S, anti-money laundering laws, even though BitMEX was based in the Seychelles. And then, of course, came FTX. FTX was based in Hong Kong and then moved to the Bahamas. Sam Bankman-Fried desperately wanted to make it in the United States, paying huge sums of money for celebrity endorsements and stadium naming rights, all while trying to woo politicians in Washington. In the end, FTX’s global operation never made it into the U.S., with the exception of the much smaller and less powerful FTX.US. Instead, Bankman-Fried ended up getting torn apart by U.S. prosecutors in a U.S. court.  The U.S. still has allure for crypto businesses. Despite the pull of dynamic regions such as Asia or the Middle East, it’s hard to avoid the U.S. Did an overseas exchange have U.S. users? Did it mislead U.S. investors? Or did the CEO have meetings in the United States?  “The burden for venue is not very high,” Samson Enzer, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor, told the Wall Street Journal last year. “The government would argue that if a single email went through New York, that would suffice.”  We probably will never see another company quite like Binance. Crypto itself might be borderless, but crypto companies may find it increasingly hard to operate outside of legal or geographical boundaries. In the early days of crypto, it seemed possible to launch a massive exchange that slipped through the grasp of any jurisdiction.

20517401,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561718,1700607606,Did JPMorgan Secretly Buy 7.5 Million XRP? Here’s What We Know,"The crypto rumor mills have been abuzz lately with talk of JPMorgan, a US megabank, secretly buying XRP tokens. This rumor has gained ground and in the course of its spread, has garnered the attention of the crypto community as they dissect it. JPMorgan Reportedly Buys 7.5 Million XRP The first reports of this rumor emerged after a news report citing a leaked report, claimed that the investment giant had actually bought 7.5 million XRP tokens. This rumor quickly made its way to social media where users on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) have spread it widely. Related Reading: AVAX Open Interest Climbs 10.4% To $224 Million, Is $30 Possible? One of the most prominent reposts of the article includes that of Amelie, a German influencer with over 27,000 followers on X. As the rumors gain more popularity, it has also come under scrutiny due to its lack of evidence and the fact that the numbers do not add up. 🚨 JUST IN: BLACKROCK AND JPMORGAN PURCHASED OVER 7.5 MILLION #XRP https://t.co/dmQajvjhuk — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 🍭 (@_Crypto_Barbie) November 19, 2023 For example, one X user points out that the article says that the 7.5 million XRP reportedly bought by JPMorgan makes up 7.5% of its portfolio. However, this would mean that JPMorgan’s total portfolio would have to be worth $6.2 billion as opposed to its actual $440 billion value. Ludicrous. Look at this quote. “The leaked report, allegedly from an anonymous insider w/in JPM, reveals a significant revelation—the banking giant has quietly amassed over 7.5 M XRP, representing >7.5% of its total wealth.” JPM is only worth $6.2B? It’s market cap is $440B — AgentSmith (@AgentSmithV3) November 19, 2023 There have also not been any official statements from JPMorgan about buying XRP or actually holding any cryptocurrency in their portfolio. Interestingly, JPMorgan actually launched its own JPM Coin which will reportedly be used to carry out $10 billion in daily transactions. Token price drops to $0.61 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Adding BlackRock To The Debate The rumors have also included BlackRock showing an interest in XRP but so far, there has been no indication that this is the case. The only time that BlackRock has been heavily mentioned around XRP communities is when a fake filing of a BlackRock XRP ETF showed up on the Delaware Corporation website. This fake filing has since been taken down and the Delaware authorities have reportedly begun their investigations to figure out the party or parties that were behind the fake filing. Related Reading: Cardano Falling Wedge Pattern: Analyst Predicts 100% Increase Following Breakout XRP influencer CryptoInsightUK also took to X (formerly Twitter) to debunk the rumors of BlackRock buying the token. He referred to it as a “stupid rumor” and that it is untrue, advising investors to not be distracted by the “noise.” Just FYI $XRP fam, there is a stupid rumour that Blackrock has bought 7.5 million $XRP. This is untrue. Focus up, things will get going again soon, don’t get dissuaded by noise. 🫡 — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) November 20, 2023 Although JPMorgan and BlackRock are not going in on XRP, banks all around the world are reportedly trying to tap into the potential. A new report from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revealed that the token currently ranks third in the list of digital assets held by global banks. XRP reportedly makes up 2% of the 9.4 billion euros that these banks have invested in digital assets, meaning they hold around 188 million euros worth of XRP.

Chainlink Is Escaping Out Of A Bull Flag Pattern Currently In a new post on X, analyst Ali pointed out a breakout that may be forming in the LINK price chart. The relevant technical pattern here is the “bull flag,” which, as its name implies, looks like a flag on a pole. This pattern forms when the asset’s price goes through a pullback after seeing a sharp rally and consolidates inside a region. The initial trend acts as the “pole,” while the parallel trendlines of the consolidation region make up the “flag.” Related Reading: Solana Forms Sell Signal, Decline To $30 Ahead? The flag’s length (the distance between the parallel trendlines) is always at most half the length of the pole. If it’s not, then the pattern isn’t that of a bull flag. Inside the flag, the price feels resistance at the upper line and support at the lower one. A successful break out of the resistance zone generally indicates that the asset is ready to continue the initial uptrend. According to the analyst, the chart below shows that such a pattern is forming for Chainlink. The bull flag pattern that the price of LINK is displaying right now | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the graph, Chainlink had earlier been consolidating inside what seems to have been a bull flag, but with the recent surge, the asset has seen a break out of the pattern. When Ali shared the chart, LINK had been trading just under the $15 mark. The analyst had noted that a retest of the breakout zone could happen soon, around $14. The cryptocurrency has indeed made such a retest since then, as its price has observed some retrace. Ali believes the price could rally towards the $20 mark, continuing the bullish momentum from earlier. From the current asset price, such a jump would imply profits of almost 42% for Chainlink. It remains to be seen whether the bull flag pattern holds for the cryptocurrency this time and if a return to a bullish trend occurs. LINK Has Seen A Rally Of 185% In The Past Month Regardless of the recent pullback that the asset has seen from above the $16 mark, its returns for the last 30 days are still incredible, as they currently stand at a whopping 85%.

42409424,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHIBX,1700602255,"Binance, Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao Handing Over Record $1.35B Fine in CFTC Settlement","Crypto exchange Binance and its founder, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, agreed to pay nearly $3 billion to settle the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission lawsuit against it, including a $1.35 billion fine that is the largest ever secured by the regulator. This builds on separate settlements Tuesday with the U.S. Department of Justice and Treasury Department, which also called Binance's penalties the largest ever targeted at a single corporation.  The CFTC sued Binance earlier this year, alleging that the exchange offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S. despite knowing that was against the law. The suit highlighted the ""maze of corporate entities"" Binance had, which an official said demonstrated the exchange's ""willful evasion of U.S. law.""  In a press conference Tuesday, CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said the exchange's actions ""undermined the foundation of safe and sound financial markets"" while collecting $1.35 billion in trading fees.  ""As evidenced by the internal chats of Binance’s CCO and others, Binance recognized that its platform was used to facilitate criminal activity, including terrorist financing, but chose to turn a blind eye, all in the name of profits,"" Behnam said. ""Binance and its leaders sought to dupe and indoctrinate their employees and customers, building a cult-like following premised on circumventing their own compliance controls to maximize corporate profits above all else.""  Samuel Lim, the former chief compliance officer, will pay $1.5 million as well if a federal judge signs off on the proposed settlements. He is also banned from acting as an unregistered futures commission merchant or operating any illegal crypto derivatives platforms, the regulator said.  Going after a company's compliance chief marked a novel enforcement move for the CFTC, according to Commissioner Caroline Pham. She noted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has pursued such officials before, but this is ""the first time that the CFTC is charging a compliance officer with individual liability.""  ""I believe that the alleged facts involving egregious personal conduct demonstrate that the defendant employee was 'compliance in name only,'"" Pham said in a statement on Tuesday. ""I support sending this strong message to the crypto asset sector, which has all too often demonstrated material weaknesses in both their compliance programs and their risk management programs.""  Behnam also noted how quickly the agency resolved its major enforcement action against Binance and its former CEO.  ""The resolution of the action against Binance and Zhao – within just 8 months of its filing – solidifies the CFTC’s reputation as the proven leader in the civil enforcement space when it comes to digital assets,"" the chairman said. ""We are stalwart in ensuring CFTC registrants comply with our statute and regulations, which serve to protect broader financial health and that directly impacts millions of American investors.""  Unfortunately for Binance, the SEC is still pursuing its similar but separate action against the exchange, which this week's multi-headed government deal didn't satisfy.

According to statistics, WLD, the native token on Worldcoin, a project co-founded by Altman, and other tokens, including FET, the primary coin behind the AI-reliant blockchain, Fetch.ai, appear to be primary gainers. Even so, WLD prices remain below November 2023 lows when writing. WLD Remains Volatile Even so, looking at market data, the spike in crypto AI trading volume seems driven mainly by WLD activity. Looking at the project’s share, trading volume comprises over 33% of all related crypto AI trading volume. While there is a noticeable spike in activity, it remains below the all-time high of above $4 billion in Q1 2023. Then, traders and investors were keen on AGIX, the SingularityNET token. However, over the months, Worldcoin has since taken over as investor interest shifted to WLD, evidenced by the gradual rise of trading volume. Looking at WLD price action over the past three days, prices have been volatile, though trading volume has been mostly up from November 13. Following news of Altman’s removal as CEO of OpenAI, prices fell before slightly expanding with news of negotiations to return to the role, followed by his appointment to lead Microsoft’s AI team. Related Reading: Analyst Sets $30,000 Floor For Bitcoin, But Can We Forget 2021’s Misfire? All these events have contributed to the market’s heightened interest in WLD. Accordingly, trading volume across the broader crypto AI scene stands above the $2 billion level for the first time since March. The Sam Altman And OpenAI Drama Turns Attention To Worldcoin Though there is no direct connection between OpenAI and Worldcoin, crypto participants focus on events at OpenAI and how the board handled Altman as a factor catalyzing WLD’s activity. The general lack of clarity on why the board ousted Altman as CEO worsens the situation, sparking speculation that this could also impact WLD’s prices and how Worldcoin is governed, considering the former CEO is also behind the crypto AI project. Looking at the co-founder’s previous role as the team leading Worldcoin’s developments, Altman also holds significant sway, contributing to discussions on how the government should regulate AI at the end of the day. Related Reading: Solana Forms Sell Signal, Decline To $30 Ahead? Altman’s influential role has impacted Worldcoin and its prices since the blockchain project aims to create a global identity system.

The exchange will pay $3.4 billion to FinCEN and $968 million to OFAC as part of these settlements, which saw both agencies accuse Binance of violating the Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions programs. Binance had already said it will pay $4.3 billion in fines and forfeitures to the U.S. Department of Justice to settle charges it violated sanctions law and failed to maintain a proper know-your-customer program.

42409425,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHIEq,1700598426,"Binance Got Huge Due to U.S. Customers. That Was Illegal, U.S. Says","Binance relied in its early days on American customers for the bulk of its revenue, its trading activity and thus its status as the world's largest crypto exchange.  Charging documents unsealed Tuesday against the exchange and its founder Changpeng Zhao – better known as CZ – detail years of compliance failures and obfuscation in the name of protecting Binance's most valuable – and off-limits – users. But Binance wasn’t allowed to service those customers because it wasn't a registered U.S. business, according to the government.  Read more: Binance to Pay $4.3B to Settle U.S. Accusations; Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao Resigns as CEO and Pleads Guilty in Seattle  Binance targeted growth in the U.S. market, especially among ""VIP"" users who drove the exchange's trading volume and thus its revenue. These power users and their liquidity helped make Binance a juggernaut in crypto trading. According to the government, Binance's executives ""tracked and monitored"" the exchange's performance in the U.S. market and even touted their success.  As much as 30% of the exchange's web traffic (and just as much revenue) originated in the U.S. in early 2018, the filing said. When CZ learned about this, he said Binance should block IP addresses and implement know-your-customer requirements because ""it's better than losing everything.""  In spite of this, CZ and Binance squirreled away their most valuable U.S. users through an API that allowed them to keep using the main exchange, according to the government. This came even as Binance launched a separate U.S. exchange – Binance.US – that implemented KYC requirements lacking on the main exchange.  In June 2019, CZ and other high-ranking Binance officials ""encouraged"" the high-value U.S. clients to ""conceal and obfuscate their U.S. connections."" The Binance officials discussed these strategies on recorded calls and directed staff to assist these customers in compliance evasion, like dropping hints that they should use a different IP address.  By September 2020, some 16% of the main exchange's customer base came from the U.S. – making it Binance's most important country despite its prohibitions. ""The following month"" Binance relabeled its corresponding pie chart, replacing the ""United States"" userbase label with ""UNKWN.""  These customers generated ""trillions of dollars in transactions"" for Binance and generated $1.6 billion in profit between August 2017 and October 2022.  Failure to AML  Binance's compliance failures also led it to process hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions originating from darknet marketplaces including Hydra and crypto mixing services including BestMixer.  Sometimes Binance's staff would become aware that criminals were using the site but let them continue anyway, ""particularly if they were VIP users."" Instead of booting the illicit exchange users, they were instructed to check their status and maybe give a slap on the wrist with a warning not to route money from the darknet market again.  The fast and loose mindset had massive ramifications for Binance's compliance with the U.S. sanctions regime. To put it bluntly, it did nothing to ensure money wasn't flowing between the U.S. and Iran.  Inside the belly of every exchange is a matching engine: the piece of computer code that helps move coins between buyers and sellers. Binance's engine matched users in the U.S. to those in Iran. According to the filing, Binance caused ""at least 1.1 million"" illegal transactions worth nearly $900 million.  CZ and his deputies knew their matching engine could lead to Binance violating U.S. laws but did little to stop it, the government said. The only solution was to implement KYC on all users, a step they did not fully take until May 2022.  Internally, CZ recognized the risks of sanctions violations and the need for remediation as early as 2018, per the document. But Binance ""refused to devote significant resources to"" fixing the hole.  Amid all this was the question of where Binance was actually based. CZ and his company were ""intentionally vague"" about their HQ for years, with executives hopping between Asia and the Middle East. Their hope was the globetrotting would ""make Binance more difficult to regulate.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/21/binance-got-huge-due-to-us-customers-that-was-illegal-us-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4aec275c89aaff4a9d7209906d11e8fcd72d872-5568x3132.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Its native FET token has seen an impressive move upward since then, maintaining its bullish headwinds at the same time. But even after the altcoin has grown so much, crypto analysts are convinced that the coin is only at its starting level, and will continue to rise. Analyst Who Called FET Initial Rise Is Back Again Crypto analyst Tony The Bull, Founder of CoinChartist, was one of the most vocal voices for buying FET when the price fell to $0.09 back in 2022. The coin has since risen more than 5x from this level but even this has not deterred the analyst, who believes that there is more to come. Related Reading: Solana Captures Institutional Investors’ Attention, Inflows Rise To $135 Million In a recent analysis, Tony presented the reasoning behind why he is still bullish on the FET price. The analyst had previously expected a retracement. But from the current level, expect the price to increase once more. The chart shows an initial bounce above the $2.5 mark before a retracement that takes it back down to around $0.55. Then from here, there is another bounce upward to over $4 once more. If this plays out as expected, then the FET price could be looking toward multiple bounces of over 500% from here. Updated plan pic.twitter.com/pkfhHBQxCC — Tony “The Bull” (@tonythebullBTC) November 20, 2023 Fetch AI On Bulls’ Radar In the same vein as Tony The Bull, another crypto analyst has predicted that the price of FET is headed for more rallies. The analyst who goes by TradingShot posted the analysis on TradingView where they revealed their target for the price. Similar to Tony’s first target, TradingShot expects a rally that will bring the price above $2. The analyst identified a Golden Cross on the 1-day (1D) chart, noting that this is the fourth bullish pattern that has shown up in the FET long-term channel. Source: Tradingview.com According to the crypto analyst, whenever such a bullish pattern emerged, the price had already started moving up. But actually, it is just the beginning as the main rally often happens after this 1D Golden Cross on the price chart is noted.

42409406,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHHKd,1700596700,"After CZ Quits as Binance CEO, Richard Teng Looks Like the Heir Apparent","Editor's note: Less than an hour after this story was published, Richard Teng posted on X that he was now Binance's CEO.  News that Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao is stepping down after pleading guilty to U.S. criminal charges puts the spotlight firmly on rising star Richard Teng, who was promoted to the top ranks at the exchange earlier this year and who is viewed as the heir apparent at the world's largest crypto exchange.  Teng, a one-time Abu Dhabi regulator, was appointed to oversee Binance's regional markets outside the U.S. in June of this year. At that time, he gave an interview to CoinDesk, pointing out that he wanted to show that Binance could be ""a new organization.""  Binance representatives did not respond to requests for confirmation that Teng would be taking over as CEO of the exchange.  Teng's strength is regulation and compliance, an area that has been a primary focus for Binance for the last couple of years. Before heading up the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), he was chief regulatory officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and spent 13 years with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).  The need for someone with Teng's expertise at Binance has become even more apparent as regulatory scrutiny has intensified this year, leading to Tuesday's explosive news that the U.S. charged the exchange with breaking sanctions and money-transmitting laws and agreed to pay $4.3 billion to settle the allegations.

20509806,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561797,1700593201,From Cool-Off To Takeoff: How XRP’s Current Value Signals An Imminent Market Triumph,"Ben Armstrong, a well-known crypto analyst and YouTuber has recently offered an intriguing perspective on XRP’s current trading value. XRP, a token closely watched in the crypto community, particularly after its legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), currently trades at around $0.60. While this figure might not represent an all-time high, Armstrong highlights why this price point might be pivotal for XRP. Related Reading: 3 Altcoins Set To Skyrocket In Next Crypto Bull Run, According To Analyst The Bigger Picture: Institutional Interest And Market Dynamics Armstrong’s analysis begins with the “adamantium” support level of $0.60 for XRP. Drawing an analogy with the fictional character Wolverine, who famously recovers from severe damage, Armstrong sees XRP’s resilience at this price as a sign of robustness. Each time XRP’s value dips, it seemingly rebounds from this critical support level, suggesting a strong market faith in the token. Armstrong goes beyond price analysis to consider broader market dynamics in his video. He notes that XRP’s previously traded price level of $0.62 has become particularly attractive to institutional and corporate investors. Whale transactions involving substantial quantities of XRP have increased significantly, indicating heightened interest from large-scale investors. This trend aligns with a broader global crypto market cap increase, suggesting ample liquidity for significant investments. Armstrong also touches upon the strategic aspect of XRP’s price following Ripple’s legal victory over the SEC. He posits that a post-verdict price surge might have limited the token’s accessibility to a broader audience. However, the current steadier price range, a retrace of the previously seen $0.72, allows for a more extensive accumulation of XRP, potentially setting the stage for a bigger bull run. XRP Latest Price Action XRP’s market performance has recently shown a notable decline, with its price falling by over 10% in the past two weeks. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at approximately $0.605, reflecting a 2.3% decrease in the past 24 hours. Despite a significant bullish trend earlier this year, where it surged by 70.3% year to date, XRP remains substantially lower, down by 82.20%, from its all-time high of $3.40 in 2018. This downward trend extends beyond just XRP’s price. The past two weeks have also decreased the asset’s daily trading volume, descending from highs of around $2.5 billion early last week to roughly $1.1 billion in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Wall Street Expert Predicts Ripple IPO Date This decline in trading volume may signal a decrease in investor interest or market activity surrounding the asset, contributing to its reduced price. Moreover, the broader crypto market has seen a mix of volatility and bearish trends, which might influence XRP’s performance. So far, Bitcoin has also declined by 2% in the past 24 hours, resulting in the drawdown of the global crypto market cap of 1.3% over the same period.

42409414,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHHhm,1700591327,‘They’re Playing a Game’: What New Yorkers Think of the SEC’s War Against Crypto,"Is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) ongoing war of attrition against the crypto industry a good use of tax money? The industry itself has, for years, been calling for intermediation by regulators.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     And SEC Chair Gary Gensler and his lead police enforcer, SEC Director Gurbir Grewal, consistently say their campaign of lawsuits is just. Speaking in their most recent regulatory escalation, a 90-page complaint filed against San Francisco-based exchange Kraken, Grewal said:  “We allege that Kraken made a business decision to reap hundreds of millions of dollars from investors rather than coming into compliance with the securities laws. That decision resulted in a business model rife with conflicts of interest that placed investors’ funds at risk.”  The SEC has a multi-part mandate, to facilitate capital formation in a safe and sound manner and protect the U.S. investing public by enforcing financial transparency through disclosures. So what do consumers actually think? Should crypto be regulated? Is the SEC’s manner of “regulating through enforcement” helpful?  See also: Kraken Accused by SEC of Operating Unregistered Platform  CoinDesk asked members of the general public across three villages in southern Westchester just this, to take the temperature. And the responses — especially in light of the past couple years, during which crypto was defined by cases the fraud, bankruptcy filings and declining prices reported on by the media — were mixed.  Emma Sanchez, in Tuckahoe, for instance, didn’t have her mind made up on crypto itself but thought “regulation is a good thing,” at least generally speaking. While Jason D., who works at a local metals machining facility, said that crypto represents competition to established financial actors, and that’s essentially all you need to know about why regulators have taken such an aggressive approach towards crypto.  “It’s jealousy,” he said.  To be honest, few people were aware of the SEC’s lawsuit against Kraken, or the similar actions taken against Coinbase or Binance earlier this year. Marc B., a lawyer who resides in Crestwood, said it’s unlikely the SEC would file a case it did not think it could win, or that it did not think it had justification for pursuing.  See also: Coinbase Poised to Make Final Court Pitch in Bid to Kill SEC Suit  Kraken, one of the longest-running U.S. exchanges, has been accused of commingling customer funds, listing unregistered securities and running a proprietary market making division and prop desk — allegedly putting customers at risk. At times the exchange held crypto belonging to customers valued at upwards of $33 billion, according to the SEC’s complaint.  Further, according to research conducted by Kraken’s auditor in 2023, cited by the SEC, the company had record-keeping issues that led to “material errors” in financial statements about users’ funds, including custodial accounts, between 2020 and 2021. Bank accounts that held customer money were sometimes used to pay operating expenses, due to “deficient internal controls.”  Sanchez, after hearing an overview of the charges — which also included an allegation that Kraken operated as an unlicensed exchange, broker dealer and clearing house — “sounds like a good thing.” Similar charges were brought against competing exchange Coinbase, also based in S.F., and Binance, an offshore exchange without a permanent headquarters.  See also: Binance to Settle DOJ Charges  Asked whether it makes sense for the SEC to pursue the same action against two U.S. firms, Sanchez said “a crime is a crime.” @Orlando_btc, a lawyer and founder of Lexproof, described the move as “using this as a second bite of the apple,” a way to drill down the importance of proper registrations in two different state jurisdictions.  However, in what could be described as circular reasoning, Orlando noted that the SEC cites its own Binance and Coinbase lawsuits to argue Kraken was also listing unregistered securities because they were “previously alleged [to be] securities.” He added that this “self-referential allegation holds no legal water,” which could be significant given that the “case will turn on whether the tokens” are under the SEC’s remit.  No doubt, these are serious allegations against Kraken. It takes the Coinbase suit and dials it not to 11, but maybe a seven. Suing over Kraken’s internal trading desk (the prop desk reportedly only operated briefly in 2020) draws a closer distinction to FTX and Alameda Research, which collapsed due to fraud and internal self-dealing.  Did this actually, however, represent a “significant risk of loss” to the platform’s customers, as the SEC argues? Kraken is a small, but highly-trusted exchange. Its founder and ex-CEO Jesse Powell has long been an advocate for self-custody, saying numerous times over the years that custodying customer assets actually represents a risk and liability for the company.  In response to the lawsuit, Kraken representatives said the agency’s lawsuit and critical view of crypto as a whole were ""incorrect as a matter of law, false as a matter of fact, and disastrous as a matter of policy."" It plans to “vigorously defend” itself in court, and that the “law is on our side.”  Kraken employs one of the most sophisticated legal and compliance operations in crypto, a team of dozens of lawyers led by expert Marco Santori. The exchange ultimately settled with the SEC earlier this year after the agency sued over Kraken’s now defunct staking program, which paid out yield to users who deposited tokens into a collective pool and thus resembled an “investment contract.”  See also: Coinbase Says SEC Is Attempting to 'Redefine Definitions""  At the time, Powell argued that staking isn’t without its risks, but is a clear example of where U.S. citizens should be able to determine what to do with their own money. Kraken, and the other centralized exchanges forced to terminate their staking programs, were offering alternative onramps into an activity that is much harder to do solo.  It’s a fight that in retrospect Kraken shouldn’t have given up so soon. It certainly won Kraken no favors. But also, staking is one of the few consumer use cases where crypto might make sense to the average person on the street. It’s like a savings account, only with better returns and higher risk.  Alex, of Tuckahoe, said crypto “has potential to be something cool” but has only heard of “day traders who seem to try to earn money very quickly” using crypto rather than “anyone use it for anything useful.” But she didn’t think agencies like the SEC should necessarily interfere.  “No, I think [regulation] is pointless,” she said. “It doesn’t seem like it needs to be regulated; I view it as a game.  “I guess it comes down to whether individuals are being taken advantage of. If they are, it seems appropriate to sue or regulate. But I think the people suing are playing a game as well.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/21/theyre-playing-a-game-what-new-yorkers-think-of-the-secs-war-against-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86aa1d2f3463e6946eb63404208f48a0bbfd5b18-2576x1449.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Let’s take a closer look at how the market and speculators are reacting so far. CZ To Step Down, Pleads Guilty, Company Charged $4B In Fines Earlier today, the US Department of Justice revealed it would be announcing action against a cryptocurrency company. The most dominant cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, was the target of the enforcement action, and was ordered to pay $4.3 billion in fines. Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao stepped down as a result, and plead guilt to US anti-money laundering charges. The crypto market sank in the earlier hours today in anticipation of the news. Related Reading: Failed Bearish Signal Could Send Bitcoin To $85K Next Month However, as soon as the Wall Street Journal revealed the information publicly, Bitcoin price bounced back and so did the altcoin market. Moments later, most of the upside price action was wiped out. Price as traded within roughly a 4% range today, but has traded across that several times since the news broke, highlighting powerful intraday volatility. Bitcoin price is extra volatile on the news | BTCUSD on TradingView.com The Crypto Market Reacts To The Binance News While the market tries to price in what just occurred, volatility will continue to ensue in the near term. On X (formerly Twitter), notable figures are speaking out in regards to CZ’s departure from Binance. On-chain analyst and market commentator Will Clemente points out it is “just a matter of weeks until Bitcoin ETF approval now” with Binance out of the way. The company has long been cited as a key reason for the SEC remaining hesitant to pull the trigger on a spot BTC ETF application approval.

20507876,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561785,1700589602,Celsius Network’s Shift Towards Bitcoin Mining Plan,"Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network has revealed that the company planning on switching to a Bitcoin mining-only company, following its bankruptcy court’s confirmation of the plan. Celsius Transition To Mining NewCo Celsius Network‘s transition into a mining company coincides with its bankruptcy proceedings. Over the past year, the digital assets company has experienced financial challenges, which led to its bankruptcy filing. In September, Celsius filed for a reimbursement plan as its bankruptcy plan to resolve the financial challenges in the company. This saw over 95% of Celsius’ creditors voting in favor of this reimbursement plan. According to the recent court filing, the cryptocurrency company intends to convert its services into Bitcoin mining operations exclusively and the new company will be known as Mining NewCo. Related Reading: CFTC Investigators Conclude Celsius And Former CEO Violated Rules, Potential Case Looms In addition, the company seems to have forsaken its initial plan for the company’s future with Fahrenheit Group. The firm asserted that the transition was the primary business of the new company to be formed with Fahrenheit, LLC. This was the core business of the new company that was proposed to be created with Fahrenheit, LLC that was described in the Plan (the “Fahrenheit NewCo”). The new company which was supposed to be known as Fahrenheit NewCo was formed after it purchased Celsius this year after it purchased Celsius in a bidding war. Celsius and the Fahrenheit Group initially came to a deal that the group would provide the firm with funds and operational expertise. Fahrenheit successfully acquired the firm’s assets this year. In the meantime, the firm is in touch with certain parties in order to organize the management of the Bitcoin mining company. The SEC’s Imparted The Transition Move The firm’s plan to switch to a Bitcoin mining company was triggered by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) feedback after the court confirmed its plan. The company also highlighted that the new mining company will be owned by its customers. Related Reading: Celsius Sets New Standard: $1 Billion In ETH Staked As Deposits Show No Sign Of Slowing The filing stated: Celsius received feedback from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on certain aspects of the Plan, which has resulted in Celsius now intending to begin the process to apply to register the shares in a new publicly traded Bitcoin mining company that will be owned by Celsius customers (the “Mining NewCo”). Additionally, the feedback seems to have also imparted the initial plan of transferring the firm’s assets to the Fahrenheit Group. As noted in the filing, Celsius estates will retain certain of the assets in order to be monetized by the plan administrator. However, based on the SEC’s feedback, the Debtors, in consultation with the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the “Committee”), have determined that certain of the assets that were to be transferred to the Fahrenheit NewCo must, for regulatory reasons, be retained by Celsius’s estates to be administered and monetized by the Plan Administrator and/or Litigation Administrator for the benefit of creditors.

42409407,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHHHK,1700589363,"'Buy the Rumor, Buy the News,' on Spot BTC ETF, Says One Expert, While Another Warns on Coinbase","The approval of a spot bitcoin ETF could have a huge impact on the crypto industry, more so than other previous milestones.  Analysts at JPMorgan say that the nearly 50% increase in the price of bitcoin over the last two months speaks to the potential.  Coinbase may be a long-term beneficiary but could face more immediate negative reprecussions.  With two months to go before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faces another set of deadlines to decide on a large number of applications to form spot bitcoin exchange traded-funds (ETFs), analysts are speculating on how approval of such vehicles would impact the crypto industry.  The sheer size of the applicants, which include the world's largest asset-management company BlackRock along with fellow giants like Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, means any approval would be far more influential than earlier milestones, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange introducing crypto futures in 2017 or Coinbase (COIN) going public on Nasdaq in 2021, said Pantera Capital managing partner Dan Morehead.  Those developments were “buy the rumor, sell the news” events, wrote Morehead Monday. “This time is different,” he said, well aware of the red warning flag typically raised upon utterance of that phrase. Neither of those events, he argued, had any impact on the actual demand for bitcoin. A BlackRock ETF, on the other hand, ""fundamentally changes access to bitcoin … It will have a huge (positive) impact.""  Analysts at JPMorgan concur, taking note of the nearly 50% increase in the price of bitcoin over the last two months as momentum seemingly built towards an ETF approval. The effect on specific players in the industry, however, could be less positive.  Repercussions for Coinbase  Although crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) has made itself an irreplaceable part of the ETF race, functioning as proposed custodian and surveillance partner for many of the applicants, it could also be hurt as new investors enter the space, the JPMorgan analysts predict.  “Over the intermediate term, we see ETFs as a competitive threat to Coinbase,” they wrote in a note on Tuesday. New investors may well choose an ETF as an investment tool rather than exchanges like Coinbase, which would result in a slowdown in new accounts for the company.  “Given the initial draw of Bitcoin and Ethereum, we see many novice investors never going beyond these flagship tokens and thus never needing the services of a Coinbase,” the note said. The ETF market is also more transparent, more efficient and has lower execution costs, which could force Coinbase to lower fees, the analysts wrote.  While those factors may act as a drag on the exchange's growth, Coinbase nevertheless could benefit longer-term given its role in the spot bitcoin ETF business, specifically revenue coming from its involvement as a custodian and surveillance partner, according to the analysts.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/21/buy-the-rumor-buy-the-news-on-spot-btc-etf-says-one-expert-while-another-warns-on-coinbase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea6dc7064754944a78fdbff72a541b9ccea974ea-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

All sized Bitcoin owners are Hodling. The November 2022 Bitcoin-trough was probably the Bear Bottom. ETF approvals, while important, could be a “sell the news” event. The U.S. Money Printer will likely ramp-up in 2024. Global Liquidity is expected to rise next year. Thesis I think the time to argue whether or not we're in a Bear market is over. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is rapidly approaching its April 2024 Halving Event. Despite a host of negatives, such as regulatory threats and frothy Sentiment, the long-term Bull Case is stronger than ever! As U.S. interest payments blow past $1 trillion , our gridlocked government is left with no choice but to use its money printer. A debased currency combined with quantitative easing in 2024, strongly favor higher prices. Bitcoin's halving plus lost coins results in excellent Tokenomics of a non-inflationary digital store of value. In this article, I will explain these bullish catalysts one Satoshi at a time. Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme? It's been six years since I jumped head-first into the Bitcoin rabbit hole. While I'm a Crypto-Degen (i.e., irresponsibly long Altcoins) I appreciate the value of Bitcoin. However, to be honest, I'm not 100% all-in. Retail investors' "" Number Go Up "" meme isn't going to attract pedigreed, baby-step institutional investors. The US dollar isn't just the reserve currency because a bunch of people believe in it (as is partially the case for Bitcoin). While the US dollar is a fiat currency and not explicitly backed by anything (thanks Nixon !) it's implicitly backed by the world's mightiest military, taxing power and trade flows. The U.S. also owns federal lands, foreign currency reserves, treasuries and gold bars, (albeit, in aggregate they are financed by debt). (Characteristics that make ""good money"" are in the table below.) Nonetheless, Bitcoin has its own set of positive attributes. It's public (i.e., open-source software), permanent (i.e., immutable) and decentralized (not controlled by one entity). Last week, a young lady said something so simple that everything just clicked for me. She said that ""the U.S. government's irresponsible stewardship has broken its contract with its citizens -that's why Bitcoin exists."" Fidelity Investments Finding Risk in all the Wrong Places As someone who spent most of his working life in Risk Management, I see risk round every corner and tend to overestimate the downside. This was the case for Bitcoin where all my indicators, including On-Chain Metrics said that November 2022's price of about $15.5k was ""rock bottom."" (For a long-term price-perspective, see the Rainbow Chart below.) Apparently two blowups (Terra-Luna, FTX) in five months did the trick! However, I thought that a still Hawkish Fed would suppress prices. With 20/20 hindsight, I will say that Nov'22 was Bitcoin's Bear Bottom though the riskier Altcoins probably won't get a bid until liquidity rises meaningfully. There's a saying ""if liquidity's leaving, then Altcoins are bleeding."" Blockchain Center My Bearishness in June This summer I published an article on Seeking Alpha geared towards Bitcoin hodlers. It gave a laundry list of why Bitcoin could decline from ~ $31k, and it subsequently declined to $25k. That marked a major floor before the ETF craze started. The bear list included: Sell in May and go away (i.e., seasonal weakness) Regulatory Enforcement (Operation Chokepoint 2.0) Accumulation by ""weak hands"" (i.e., Retail) whiles Whales were selling Tightening Liquidity Greedy Sentiment Negative On-Chain Metrics Several of these have turned supportive of higher prices. As we approach the Halving date, it will be difficult to fight the tape of rising price momentum. The weakest seasonal period (September) for Bitcoin has long passed and average historical monthly price gains suggests price support through July. Glassnode, Deutsche Bank The improvement of the above factors hasn't surprised me, except for one - Accumulation/Distribution. During April'23, smaller bitcoin holders were accumulating while the largest were selling (not a good sign which is typical of local tops). As prices jumped in 3Q'23, I expected most cohorts, especially large ""Whale"" holders to be selling aggressively. But this is not happening - in fact nearly all cohorts are accumulating (blue squares) into a local top. Strange, no? (As a background, Glassnode tranches holders according to six cohorts with the largest being those holding greater than 10,000 Bitcoins.) Glassnode Long-Term vs. Short-Term Holders Another way of showing accumulation and distribution is examining the long-term cumulative accumulation of hodlers, or those holders that removed their Bitcoins from centralized exchanges. Long-term holders tend to accumulate as Bitcoin hits bear market bottoms while Short-term holders accumulate during the FOMO craze at Bull Tops. The chart below divides LT Holder supply by ST holder supply. It's at the highest level in history meaning long-term holders refuse to sell. Again, we're witnessing a historical bullish anomaly. Heavy LT accumulation has resulted in long-term supply of nearly 15 million Bitcoin that has effectively been taken-off the market. That 15 million also includes lost coins. James Mullarney ( InvestAnswers ) has estimated lost coins to be between 3-6 million bitcoin. For comparison, Bitcoin's Circulating Supply is 19.5 million, which leaves just 4.5 million available to trade. That ""float"" is so small that any demand could result in a sharp increase in price . (Note: Glassnode makes the assumption that beyond a certain time, it's more and more likely that those Bitcoin will never be sold.) Glassnode The 2024 Halving Event The most important catalyst on the Bitcoin Calendar is the four-year Halving . Ironically, it isn't a set date but an estimate as the halving occurs when block number 840,000 is produced. This ""date"" was originally estimated for March/April 2024; however, I believe it will be pushed back a bit to end of April depending on mining difficulty and the network hash-rate. Nonetheless, it will result in block rewards being halved to 3.125 BTC-USD. This effectively reduces Miner returns and reduces the number of coins coming onto the market. Inflation will decline 50%, from 1.8% to 0.9%. Even though the Halving is the most important catalyst, I placed it below the Accumulation and LT supply bullet-points to stress that this will be the first time that there's a Halving occurring in period of already reduced circulating supply. The period after the halving has historically been associated with very large price gains. While I believe the halving is behind Bitcoin's large price moves, note that the four-year halving seems to be highly correlated with the global liquidity cycle. I particularly like this chart below as the "" You are here "" dot shows that we're just in the beginning of what could be a large up-move over the next 2-3 years. Ecoinometrics Global Liquidity is Edging Up When I last wrote about the Debt Ceiling, I said that the Treasury General Account (TGA) which is basically its wallet, had to be refilled, which could drain nearly $0.7 trillion of liquidity. In fact, that's exactly what's been added so far. Now that it's filled, the only large drain is the Fed's ongoing Quantitative Tightening, which is removing a more palatable $0.1 trillion per month. Also supporting liquidity are Chinese and Japanese efforts to support their economies via liquidity injections. So long that U.S. inflation keeps edging lower, I believe liquidity will increase in 2024, especially if the Fed suddenly realizes it's dealing with a recession. My view is supported by Mike Howell ( Crossborder Capital ) who's a leading authority on the subject. Remember, 2024 is also an election year and the Biden Administration will likely pressure Jay Powell to reduce rates. One method of measuring liquidity is summing Central Bank balance sheets plus adjustments such as the TGA, Reverse Repos, etc. Another way is conducted by measuring changes in Global Money Supply (M2) of which Bitcoin is highly correlated (chart below). Global Macro Investor Debasement of the U.S. Dollar Actually all major currencies are being debased as sovereign governments believe a little inflation is a good recipe to avoid depression. The fear is that deflation would cause a vicious circle of lower prices, lower wages and a shrinking economy. Whether it's true is irrelevant - the result is that the Dollar's value declines against real assets. Bitcoin's Tokenomics make it resistant to such debasement. When the U.S. economy entered recession during the 2008 Global Financial Crises and Covid-lockdown, the Federal Reserve's knee-jerk reaction was to print trillions of dollars (this can be seen by its higher balance sheet ). I also expect the U.S. to ""monetize"" its interest payments, which recently blew past $1 trillion. This is because the level of U.S. Debt/GDP has soared beyond a tipping point and so the ONLY way to pay interest costs will be by cranking the money-printer (""more cowbell""). Bitcoin, in comparison, doesn't care how the U.S. or ANY economy is doing as its monetary system is set in code. (The chart below shows U.S. CPI based inflation over the last 60 years.) Bloomberg LP Prospects for a Spot Bitcoin ETF There are one dozen Exchange Traded Funds waiting to get approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). I have little to add to this well publicized rumor with the exception that it could be a ""sell the news"" event short-term. The listing of Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and listing of the Bitcoin Futures ETF both marked local tops. However, spot ETF listings could have legs longer term. I think we're getting sooner to an approval ( probably early 2024 ) given that the SEC's now asking questions to the applicants, Grayscale's court ruling victory and given Gary Gensler's in the hot seat with several congressmen. So Why Am I More Bullish Longer Term? One word- BlackRock, but not because it has zillions of dollars in custody. BlackRock's secret sauce is Aladdin - a tech-based portfolio management system, not only used by asset managers and BlackRock's competitors (e.g., Vanguard) but by the largest corporate treasuries (think Apple, Google). Portfolios have been shown to be optimized on the efficient frontier by adding a small amount of Bitcoin. I expect BlackRock to ""sell its book"" meaning it'll recommend its spot Bitcoin ETF to clients. For perspective, Aladdin advised $ 21.6 trillion of assets (global AUM: $131 trillion in 2021, Chart below ) while Bitcoin's market cap is still around $0.7 trillion. Lots of potential here. Statista Conclusion: As I was completing this article, Bitcoin ran-up to another local top on more Bitcoin ETF rumors. Fear & Greed Indices are hovering at exuberant levels, with the biggest risk being ""do we have enough champagne?"" Otherwise, I think triple catalysts of the Halving Event, higher Liquidity and ETF approvals will propel Bitcoin higher over the next year. There are other important developments I'll dig into in future articles including attempts by the BRICS countries to destabilize the US Dollar, a Debt Jubilee and prospects for adding Bitcoin into the U.S. treasury reserve.

New on-chain data has shown a clearer sentiment among ETH investors, and it looks like many are getting ready for the long haul. Data shows that the amount of Ethereum held on exchanges has dropped since the middle of last week to the lowest levels since 2018. That means fewer people are selling their Ethereum, and more are holding onto it or staking it. Ethereum Exchange Supply Plummeting Although Ethereum is still down by 2.57% in the past seven days, the cryptocurrency is now trading above $2,000 after breaking the barrier on Monday, November 21. The recent surge would be the third time Ethereum crossed over the price level this month, as it’s still looking to maintain a sustained price increase. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 98.79% With Less Than 1 Million Tokens Burned The recent spikes can be attributed to applications of Ethereum Spot ETFs piling up in front of the US SEC. BlackRock, in particular, joined the spot Ethereum ETF race on November 15th, igniting a price spike that pushed ETH past the $2,000 mark for the second time this month. It would appear that investors reacted to BlackRock’s ETH filing with the same sentiment they had in response to the investment company’s spot Bitcoin filing. CryptoQuant’s Exchange Reserves metric indicates that investor sentiment started to change around this period, as investors started to pull their assets off of exchanges into cold storage immediately after the news. According to the metric, the number of ETH deposited across crypto exchanges amounted to 14.5 million as of November 15. However, this figure dropped by 152,583 ETH in the days after to reach 14.3 million on November 20th. Source: CryptoQuant IntoTheBlock’s exchange netflow reveals a similar sentiment. The netflow calculates the number of tokens entering exchanges minus tokens leaving exchanges. According to the metric, exchanges have had around 228,450 ETH more in outflows than inflows since November 15. Source: IntoTheBlock What To Expect For ETH Price Action In The Coming Months Dropping exchange reserves reduces the amount of ETH available for trading, thereby increasing scarcity.

42409423,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHHyJ,1700586000,Crypto Industry Goes Nuclear With Uranium-Linked Tokens,"Many a crypto degen trader is trolling digital-asset markets for the next hot token. The blockchain industry's latest offering might be thought of as thermonuclear.  A uranium-linked token called Uranium3o8 (U) opened for trading on Uniswap Tuesday in an attempt to shake up how the highly-regulated heavy metal is bought and sold.  ""Our goal is to create a spot market"" for uranium, said Ryan Gorman, head of strategy at Uranium3o8.  Canada-based public uranium exploration and development firm Madison Metals Inc. (GREN) provides the asset backing for the U tokens, which represent one pound of uranium. Sanmiguel Capital Investments LLC is responsible for the token issuance and administration.  Owners of U token can't just request physical delivery of its underlying yellowcake. Although U is listed on a decentralized exchange, its website says buyers must pass a ""strict compliance protocol"" managed by Madison Metals, to make sure they won't build a nuclear weapon, for example. They also need to redeem a minimum of 20,000 U tokens.  ""The project has already received interest for up to $10m of physical settlement order from a compliant and licensed uranium broker, with delivery to a compliant, licensed enricher in Europe,"" said Madison Metals CEO Duane Parnham.  The offering arrives as tokenized real-world assets (RWA) have become a red-hot sector in crypto. The process consists of crafting tokens backed by traditional assets – bonds, investment funds or commodities like gold – and placing them on blockchain rails.  Traditional finance giants as well as digital asset firms are making headway in tokenization as the technology promises lower frictions in trading and transacting, near-instant settlements, less administrative burden and can provide improved access for investors. Asset management firm 21.co forecasted that the market for tokenized assets could mushroom to $10 trillion by the end of the decade.  The token's link to its underlying asset is structured as a forward sales offtake agreement, according to Parnham, a 30-year veteran of the uranium mining industry. He said the token's uranium backing will come from Madison's Namibian mines, which are not in production yet as well as its partnerships with other industry players.  Some of the yellowcake is ready to go for physical delivery, said Gorman. The rest of the 20 million pounds of earmarked uranium is still underground.  Uranium is a crucial metal for energy production in nuclear power plants with rising demand. However, the commodity doesn't have an open spot market, and trading occurs via private negotiations between buyers and sellers, commodity giant Cameco points out.  Uranium3o8 aims to make the asset's pricing less opaque and accessible for a broader investor base by replacing the industry's current procurement contracts process.  ""The bidding for this contract [private negotiations] can last days, weeks or even months, and is subject to inconsistent, objective pricing based on a number of opaque factors. With $U, the price the token trades at is how much an institution pays per ounce of uranium,"" said Gorman.  Uranium3o8 plans to roll out additional products for the uranium industry participants early next year, Gorman said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,"Krisztian Sandor, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/21/crypto-industry-goes-nuclear-with-uranium-linked-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b4cf8e1a41813de9ec9da1bb920f4909639c330-5184x3240.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao pleaded guilty in Seattle to charges he personally faced and agreed to pay a $50 million fine, as well as step down from the CEO job. Richard Teng, a former Abu Dhabi regulator and later Binance's regional markets head, will take over as CEO.  Binance was accused of failing to maintain a proper anti-money laundering program, operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and violating sanctions law, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday.  Zhao pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act and causing a financial institution to violate the BSA, according to another filing. His fine will be credited against the amount he owes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice said.  ""Binance employees knew and discussed that the company was serving thousands of users in sanctioned countries, and they knew that facilitating transactions between U.S. users and users in sanctioned countries would be in violation of U.S. law. But they did it anyway,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said during a press conference on Tuesday afternoon.  The $4.3 billion Binance is paying is among the largest penalties ever obtained from a corporate defendant, Garland said. The exchange's overall fine remains $4.3 billion, with some amount being credited to each agency.  Separately, the U.S. Treasury Department and CFTC announced their own settlements with Binance. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen noted that Binance's settlement with her department's money laundering and sanctions watchdogs was the largest in Treasury history.  Read more: Binance Got Huge Due to U.S. Customers. That Was Illegal, U.S. Says  Under the terms of its plea, Binance will have to appoint an independent compliance monitor for three years and report its compliance efforts to the U.S. government, alongside the fines. Zhao is prohibited from ""any present or future involvement in operating or managing"" Binance, though that ban ends three years after the monitor is appointed.  A resolution of the Binance case represents another major U.S. government victory against a big crypto player, coming just weeks after FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of fraud and conspiracy charges tied to his crypto exchange.  Zhao ""prioritized Binance's growth, market share and profits over compliance with"" U.S. banking regulations, according to unsealed filings. ""Better to ask for forgiveness than permission,"" he told his employees, the document said. That mindset pervaded Binance's operations in what Zhao termed the U.S. ""Grey zone."" He saw to it that Binance did not collect ""know-your-customer"" information on its users because he believed it would inhibit its growth and appeal.  Such oversights put Binance at risk of breaking multiple U.S. laws, including sanctions rules. According to the court filings, Zhao's staff warned him that the exchange was servicing users from sanctioned countries.  Binance's response  In a blog post, Binance acknowledged the ""resolutions"" it reached with the various agencies named, saying the exchange has worked to restructure over the past few years and citing its ""new leadership ... with deep compliance experience.""  ""We are confident that Binance will emerge as a stronger company as we lay the foundation for the next 50 years,"" the blog post said.  Teng, the new head of the exchange, said Binance still has around 150 million users and thousands of employees.  ""My focus will be on: 1) reassuring users that they can remain confident in the financial strength, security and safety of the company 2) collaborating with regulators to uphold high standards globally that foster innovation while providing important consumer protections 3) working with partners to drive growth and adoption of Web3,"" he said in a tweet.  Zhao said he may engage in passive investing or being a minority shareholder in different projects, as well as look at decentralized finance (DeFi) more.  'Significant' action  The DOJ announced early Tuesday it would hold a press conference to announce what it described as ""significant cryptocurrency enforcement actions,"" with Garland, Yellen, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco and CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam. During the press conference, Monaco said Tuesday's action ""sent an unmistakable message to crypto and DeFi companies.""  Each of the officials mentioned Binance's alleged violations, which include poor anti-money laundering procedures.  ""Over five years while building a business with U.S. customers, Binance enabled nearly $1 billion in illegal payments involving sanctioned countries and individuals,"" Monaco said.

The cryptocurrency could trend sideways at its current levels in the short term, leading analysts to find the support level that could withstand a spike in selling pressure. Related Reading: XRP Price: Cup And Handle Pattern Hints At Short-Term 208% Surge As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $37,160 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. BTC held a 2% profit the previous week, while Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) took the lead in the current price action. The History Of Bitcoin Reveals Mega Bottom For The Current Cycle? On-chain analyst Willy Woo shared a prediction on his social media channels based on the Bitcoin Cost Basis Density. The analyst investigated the BTC supply dynamics to find where the cryptocurrency could hold off the bears. Based on his findings, the analyst stated that Bitcoin is unlikely to revisit the $30,000. As seen in the chart below, each time in BTC’s history that the supply moved to long-term investors, the cryptocurrency trends to the upside without returning to this price point: $30,000 for the current cycle. The analyst set 3 conditions to confirm this pattern: first, Bitcoin must be exiting a bear market; second, there must be signs of a “high agreed price;” finally, the cryptocurrency must be about to go through a “Halving Event.” During the latter, the supply rewards for mining BTC are cut in half along with its production, which often leads to “supply shocks,” according to some analysts. Halving events coincide with the BTC bull run, but other analysts warned against corresponding Bitcoin bull runs with the reduction in its supply. The Biggest Narrative Driving The Bull Run However, Woo claims that the potential approval of a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) might be the more significant catalyst for the cryptocurrency. If the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves the product, billions of dollars flow into the cryptocurrency. The analyst added: Bitcoin is far from a commodity market at saturation. What we’re seeing across the 13 yrs of this chart is BTC’s widespread adoption. The network had 10,000 users in 2010, today there’s well over 300m people using it as a store of value technology. This is only going to climb with a spot ETF. The majority of users replying to Woo’s forecast highlighted his 2021 prediction. At that time, the analyst also set some levels that were supposed to hold against a selloff but quickly folded against unprecedented selling pressure.

42409412,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHHbA,1700580905,'We Are Prepared to Go to the Mat:' ENS Founder on Patent Dispute With Unstoppable,"The founder and lead developer of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which aims to simplify blockchain usage by providing human-readable domain names, said he’s ""prepared to go to the mat” in an intellectual-property dispute with rival Unstoppable Domains.  The comments, made by Nick Johnson in an interview with CoinDesk, come days after a spat between the companies broke out on X (formerly Twitter).  Johnson claimed in an ""open letter"" that Unstoppable won a patent in January ""based entirely on innovations that ENS developed"" and that he now fears the rival company might press the advantage for its benefit. He said he's now considering a challenge to the patent, after behind-the-scenes discussions failed to resolve the matter.  ENS is a domain-name protocol that provides Ethereum users a name, like “alice.eth,” instead of the long alphanumeric blockchain address associated with their crypto wallets. Unstoppable Domains does the same with various protocols.  Johnson says he's simply trying to defend ENS’s work and the principle of having code be open-sourced rather than patented.  “I think we've been fairly clear that this is important to us,” Johnson told CoinDesk. “And to be honest, it rankles a bit just on a personal level. Because this is mostly code and specs I wrote.""  In the Nov. 16 exchange on X, Johnson referenced a commitment by Unstoppable – made via an industry organization called the Web3 Domain Alliance – that it would not assert patent claims under certain conditions. Johnson wrote that ""press releases are not legally binding.""  He challenged Unstoppable to provide an ""unconditional and irrevocable patent pledge,"" to ""put legal weight"" behind the ""PR commitment.""  Unstoppable CEO Matthew Gould responded on X: ""There are no forward guarantees that can be made that make sense given the changing landscape of the industry. IMO the only solution is to increase collaboration and discussion.""  Gould told CoinDesk in a statement, “We refute the claim that we have stolen ENS’ intellectual property. Instead, we patented the technology we built and used ourselves for our system, which is distinct from the system ENS has built.”  The brouhaha gets at the heart of the blockchain industry's originally grassroots ethos, where an assumed deference to open-source code is mostly viewed as a driving principle behind software as a public good. Others in the industry have departed from the practice, by patenting work and then enforcing rights through the court system.  According to Johnson’s posts, he approached Unstoppable to resolve the differences, but was unsuccessful.  The Web3 Domain Alliance says on its website that it's a ""member-led, member-driven organization dedicated to improving the technological and public policy environments for users of blockchain naming services.""  Unstoppable is listed as one of dozens of ""partner"" organizations, though ENS is noticeably missing.  “It's difficult to know their intent of course, but yeah, just based on the signals they've given, I think they intend to use this and other patents as a way of sort of leveraging their industry group as a de facto regulator,” Johnson said in the interview.  “Given the environment, we may have to reconsider that and adopt an open-patent license,” he said regarding pursuing defensive patents.  Johnson said he hopes that the internet infrastructure of the future will be open and a “not-for-profit public good, rather than being run by a for-profit company.”  In the statement to CoinDesk, Unstoppable's Gould said that “the patent is directly related to the technology we deployed for our original “.crypto” registry on Ethereum and is distinct to our use, including many inventions that make it easier for a centralized company like ours to run a domain registry, for example, gasless transactions by paying for gas for users which we have offered for four years now. This is not something any other naming system did at that time.”  As for the Web3 Domain Alliance, Gould said that they “extended a Patent Non-Assertion pledge to Web3 Domain Alliance members, including ENS, demonstrating our commitment to collaborative and fair development in the domain space.""  ""The goal of the Web3 Domain Alliance is to help the Web3 domain industry, avoid collisions and develop standards,"" Gould said. ""The demand by ENS for us to open-source all of our patents overlooks the fact that we have already extended a cooperative hand through our non-assertion pledge, which ENS has yet to accept.""

Solana Weekly Chart Is In Process Of Forming A TD Sequential Sell Signal The “Tom Demark (TD) Sequential” refers to a popular tool in technical analysis that’s used to pinpoint probable tops or bottoms in the price of any given asset or commodity. This indicator is made up of two phases: the setup phase and the countdown phase. In the former, candles of the same polarity are counted up to 9. After this ninth candle, the metric signals that a likely reversal in the price is occurring now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fees Soar Above Ethereum’s As Investors Flock To Ordinals-Backed Assets Naturally, if the setup occurs with green candles, the signal would be for a probable top, meaning that it could be the time to exit from the asset. On the other hand, the opposite type of candle would imply a reversal from the bearish trend may be taking place. As explained by analyst Ali in a new post on X, the Solana 7-day chart has recently been finishing such a setup phase of the TD Sequential, suggesting the winds might be changing for the cryptocurrency. The below chart shared by the analyst shows this signal forming in SOL’s price: The pattern currently forming in the coin's weekly price chart | Source: @ali_charts on X From the graph, it’s visible that this Solana signal could be a sell one, as the TD Sequential setup phase is forming with green candles. “With the week just beginning, the upcoming days could be crucial for traders eyeing profit-booking opportunities,” notes Ali. As mentioned before, this phase isn’t the only one that the indicator has; there is also the “countdown phase.” This second phase lasts for 13 candles and starts right after the setup is finished. Once these 13 candles are done, the asset’s price could once again be assumed to have reached a state of exhaustion in its trend and a reversal may be imminent. “If the bearish formation gets confirmed, we might see a SOL downswing towards $45, potentially even dipping to $30,” explains the analyst. The former target would mean a decline of more than 21% from the current price of the coin, the latter 47%. Related Reading: Bitcoin About To Smash The $38,000 Barrier – Decoding the Next Moves It now remains to be seen whether the bearish pattern will hold for the cryptocurrency after all. If it does, the TD Sequential may once again be the metric to watch, as the countdown phase’s end could lead to a reversal in the asset’s price once more. SOL Price Solana had gone as high as $68 last week, but the cryptocurrency has since seen a sizeable drop towards the $57 mark. Nonetheless, despite this decline, the asset is in profits of more than 100% in the past month, showcasing just how strong SOL’s recent bullish momentum has been.

This news signifies a shift in the skepticism surrounding cryptocurrencies, revealing how some of the world’s leading banks seek to leverage XRP’s fundamental strengths as a cross-border payments system. BCBS Highlights XRP Dominance In The Banking Sector The Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (BCBS) has recently published its first data collection template report on banks’ holdings of crypto assets. This report gives detailed insight into the crypto exposure of global banks. Related Reading: Crypto Market Expert Identifies The Trigger For 600% Bitcoin Price Surge According to the publication, 19 out of 182 world banks in the Basel III monitoring exercise have submitted their crypto asset data to the BCBS for review and analysis. Out of the 19 banks, seven banks submitted reports from Europe, 10 banks From the Americas, and two from other parts of the world. The data collection template revealed that the majority of banks submitted reports on crypto asset exposure, primarily featuring XRP, BTC, and ETH cryptocurrencies. The report stated that the total crypto asset exposures submitted by the global banks amounted to €9.4 billion (around $10 billion). Among these exposures, XRP emerged as the third-largest altcoin utilized for bank engagements. XRP investments comprised 2% equivalent to €188 million of the total crypto asset exposures. While Bitcoin and Ether were ranked 31% and 22% respectively. “Reported crypto-asset exposures are primarily composed of Bitcoin (31%), Ether (22%), and a multitude of instruments with either Bitcoin or Ether as the underlying crypto assets (25% and 10% respectively),” the report stated. This report underscores the growing interest of XRP in the financial banking sector. The Basel III monitoring exercise report also provides a valuable benchmark for gaining insight into the position of cryptocurrencies in the financial sector. Token price resumes downtrend | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com BCBS Crypto Asset Reports In the Basel III monitoring exercise template, a collective composition of crypto asset exposures by 19 of the world banks was disclosed. The report stated that the total crypto asset exposures stand at about €9.4 billion, representing a modest fraction of the cumulative crypto-asset exposures across the 182 banks covered by the BCBS. Overall, the crypto asset exposures of the 19 banks constitute 0.05% of the total financial commitments made by the institutions under the Basel III monitoring exercise.

It added: “When considering the whole sample of banks included in the Basel III monitoring exercise (i.e. also those that do not report crypto-asset exposures), the amount shrinks to 0.01% of total exposures.” The data collection template also revealed other crypto assets employed by these world banks such as Cardano (1%), Solana (1%) Litecoin (0.4%), and Stellar (0.4%).

The company said it has bought more than 500,000 AVAX tokens, worth $8 million, in the past few months and these funds will be used to set up a validators program that benefits AVAX holders.  A validator is a participant in a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network that helps maintain security and confirms new transactions submitted to the blockchain. Validators do this by staking their tokens, typically earning rewards.  Colony Lab will also invest in the Colony Avalanche Index (CAI), a yield-bearing token index in the Avalanche ecosystem, which includes assets like AVAX and Trader Joe’s JOE. Fees from mints or redemptions will be distributed to Colony Lab’s CLY token stakers.  Rewards from both the initial and upcoming validator programs will be directed to the CLY stakers community.  ""As we channel a $10 million investment into the Avalanche ecosystem, we're not just growing Colony Lab – we're fostering the long-term potential of AVAX,” CEO Elie Le Rest said in a message to CoinDesk. “Avalanche understands that real blockchain growth comes from expanding its use cases, and its technology reflects this vision by creating a more inclusive and customizable blockchain landscape. We're thrilled to align with Avalanche's vision, and we're fully dedicated to sharing the rewards of our strategic move with our community.""

42409432,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHII9,1700571660,First Mover Americas: SEC Sues Kraken; Binance Faces $4B Settlement,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Binance Holding Ltd. would be asked to pay $4 billion to settle U.S. Department of Justice accusations of multiple criminal violations, according to a report from Bloomberg News on negotiations between the DOJ and the company, which also leave open the possibility its founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao will face U.S. criminal charges. Binance has been under a lengthy investigation by U.S. authorities for money laundering, bank fraud and violating U.S. sanctions laws, and the talks could reportedly conclude in the coming weeks. A spokesperson with the DOJ declined to comment to CoinDesk. Binance didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Crypto exchange Kraken commingled customer and corporate funds while operating as an unregistered broker, clearing agency and dealer, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged in a new lawsuit Monday. The federal regulator claimed that the San Francisco-based company violated federal securities laws in a repeat of its suits against other crypto trading platforms. Unique to Monday's lawsuit are claims that Kraken created a ""significant risk"" by commingling up to $33 billion in customer crypto with its own corporate assets, the regulator said, quoting Kraken's independent auditor. ""Similarly, Kraken has held at times more than $5 billion worth of its customers' cash, and it also commingles some of its customers' cash with some of its own,"" the suit said. ""In fact, Kraken has at times paid operational expenses directly from bank accounts that hold customer cash.""  Many of the tokens mentioned in the Kraken lawsuit have actually posted double-digit gains year-to-date. Although many would think that being named by the SEC in enforcement actions time and time again would be a sort of scarlet letter for tokens and would lead to depressed prices, market data shows that's not the case. Perhaps a lesson to take away from this is that traders value technical capability over regulatory compliance – or they understand that the SEC is not the only regulator on the planet. According to on-chain data, many named tokens have outperformed bitcoin as part of a broader market rally. The ""basket"" of these tokens is up an average of 41%. Solana's SOL is up nearly 463% year-to-date. In June, when the SEC first accused SOL of being an unregistered security, the Solana Foundation quickly hit back to deny the accusations, and, as CoinDesk reported at the time, the developer community was largely indifferent.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the percentage of bitcoin's circulating supply in profit since 2011. The metric looks at the percentage of existing coins whose price at which they last moved on-chain was lower than the current market price of bitcoin.  The seven-day moving average of percent supply in profit has jumped to 83.86%, the highest since December 2021.  It's still short of the 95% threshold that marked previous bull market tops.

Despite SHIB’s tumbling price in the past seven days, Shiba Inu’s burn rate has recorded a nearly 48,000% increase. The SHIB community is determined to cut down the Shiba Inu circulating supply, a feat that many believe will positively impact the token’s price. SHIB Community Intensify Token Burn Efforts Following Slight Decline According to data from the Shiba Inu burn tracker, Shibburn, the SHIB burn rate has spiked 47,908% in the last 24 hours. The SHIB ecosystem swept 28.129 million SHIB tokens off circulation into the dead wallet on November 21. Over the past seven days, the SHIB burn rate has increased by 26.29%, with over 290 million tokens wiped off circulation. Related Reading: Solana Captures Institutional Investors’ Attention, Inflows Rise To $135 Million According to Shibburn’s data, the most notable burn transaction was a whopping 28.15 million SHIB tokens transferred by an unknown address. The large number of SHIB tokens burned by the anonymous wallet attracted the attention of SHIB enthusiasts. Information on the SHIB burn tracking website shows that the burn transaction occurred 15 hours ago. In all these, the SHIB community has removed 410.66 trillion tokens from the initial SHIB token supply. As of writing, approximately 589.34 trillion coins remain as the total Shiba Inu token supply. Also, Shiba Inu’s circulating supply stands at ~580.4 million tokens. The Shiba Inu community has long been working to reduce the meme coin’s enormous supply and introduce scarcity. Shiba Inu token burns are often sporadic, and some days may witness more token burns than others. Today’s massive increase comes after a 98.79% decline in the SHIB burn rate observed on November 20. According to Shibburn’s November 20 report, only 983,884 Shiba Inu tokens were burnt in three transactions. The highest burn transaction was one involving 42,850 SHIB tokens. This figure represented a significant decline from what was observed in the previous days. Shiba Inu Price Outlook While members of the Shiba Inu community believe the token burn spree will positively impact SHIB’s price, the meme coin has followed an opposite trajectory. Its price has been in a downturn in the past week, with a seven-day decline of over 1%. As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu trades at $0.000008345, with a 4% 24-hour decline. SHIB candles in the past week are below the median band of the Donchian Channel (DC), suggesting a possible decline ahead for the asset. If it drops to the lower band, then the bears may take full control of its price action and could facilitate more downturns. Related Reading: Bitcoin About To Smash The $38,000 Barrier – Decoding the Next Moves But the good news is that SHIB still holds nearly 20% of its past month’s gains.

20495951,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561710,1700567438,XRP Price: Cup And Handle Pattern Hints At Short-Term 208% Surge,"In a new technical analysis, crypto analyst Dark Defender has identified a bullish ‘Cup and Handle’ pattern on the XRP daily chart, signaling the potential for substantial gains. The pattern, which is characterized by a ‘cup’ resembling a rounding bottom and a ‘handle’ indicating a slight downward drift, suggests a continuation of an upward trend. Dark Defender notes, “XRP formed a cup & handle pattern in the daily time frame. We set targets for $1.05 & $1.88 with the Elliott Waves, and now the Cup-Handle pattern is also blinking XRP to reach the targets.” Cup & Handle Pattern Hints At 208% Rally In The Short-Term The cup formation, which began in July and extended through October, saw its peak around $1.05, a critical resistance level. The XRP price then dropped by approximately 52%, perfectly aligning with the classical setup. The correction from the top of the cup to the bottom should ideally be a maximum of 50%. Related Reading: This Prediction Reveals How Long It Will Take XRP Price To Cross $10 The subsequent handle has formed a resistance zone between $0.75 and $0.6649, which is approximately a 20% retracement from the cup’s peak. Notably, the pattern suggests a bullish continuation, where the ‘cup’ represents a period of consolidation followed by a breakout, while the ‘handle’ forms a smaller pullback before the price continues to ascend. Within the chart, Dark Defender showcases key support and resistance levels crucial for this pattern to remain valid. The handle part of the pattern has potential support at $0.5286, which Dark Defender has indicated should not be broken by a close under the primary support of $0.6044 for two consecutive days to maintain the bullish outlook. Currently, the chart indicates that XRP is trading above these support levels, with resistance looming overhead. The next significant resistance is noted within the handle formation, marked at $0.6649. A decisive break above this level could confirm the pattern’s predicted outcome and set XRP on its upward trajectory toward the mentioned price targets. Related Reading: XRP Price Correction Is Over, Targets Set By Top Crypto Analysts The analyst elaborates on the handle’s potential movements, stating, “Can the handle be extended towards $0.5286 Support? We still need to close under the primary support of $0.6044 for 2 days in a row. So the answer at the moment is No.” However, he also added, “The main structure is still in place, and XRP is expected to hit $1.05 & $1.88 in the short term.” XRP Price Faces Stiff Resistance The XRP price is currently facing another crucial resistance when performing a Fibonacci retracement level analysis on the 1-day chart. Last Thursday, the XRP price fell below the 0.382 Fibonacci level at $0.6275 and has not been able to close above this key resistance since then on a daily basis. Moreover, the XRP price is sandwiched between the 20-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), between $0.6234 and $0.5919. For the bullish scenario to play out, the price needs to overcome the 20-day EMA as well as the 0.382 Fibonacci level. If this happens, Dark Defender’s bullish prediction could come a little closer.

It also brings risks.  “Whilst greater automation – likely to be the first and greatest application of AI technology for banks – has the potential to improve bank productivity and thereby enhance bank returns, we also see some vulnerabilities around broad use of AI in banks,” analysts led by Richard Thomas wrote.  The industry is highly regulated and has access to a large amount of sensitive data, which means that banks and supervisors will have to be “comfortable about the risks that accompany the institutionalization of AI,” the report said, noting that dialogue between the industry and regulators is ongoing.  Concerns are likely to be focused on security and the “challenge of keeping client assets safe in a world of democratized AI which has also delivered lower barriers to threat actors,” the authors wrote.  “Technology and social media have likely sped up deposit withdrawals,” the note said, in reference to the collapse of a number of U.S. banks earlier this year, and it is “less obvious that regulators have a clear antidote to this new reality.”  AI is already being used by most major banks, albeit cautiously, and if the technology is able to deliver tangible efficiencies for European banks and boost returns, “this is likely to be recognised with more stable to higher credit ratings and secure spreads,” the report added.  Bank of America says the revenue upside at this stage from the use of AI technology is “less tangible.”  Read more: Artificial Intelligence Trend is Accelerating With ‘Lion’s Share’ in the U.S.: Morgan Stanley",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/21/artificial-intelligence-technology-brings-benefits-risks-to-banking-bank-of-america,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98ca9304dfaf0ada21b931a0121f3a5a45b98470-5120x2880.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20493546,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561716,1700563202,"Solana Captures Institutional Investors’ Attention, Inflows Rise To $135 Million","Solana has held its stance among altcoins, registering inflows more than any other cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin last week. Institutional investment products have witnessed consecutive eight weeks of inflows, with some cryptocurrencies receiving a greater amount of inflows than others. According to the new CoinShares report on digital asset funds, the majority of this money went into Bitcoin products as the crypto continues to attract investor interest in light of recent developments in the crypto industry. Solana Gains Momentum Among Institutional Investors Solana has been on an incredible run this year, with its native SOL token up over 465% since the beginning of the year. At the same time, investment products tied to Solana have attracted major interest from institutional investors, with inflows now topping $135 million this year. According to CoinShares, digital asset investment funds registered a total inflow of $176 million last week. Out of this total inflow, $155 million went into Bitcoin, with the last eight weeks of inflows now representing 3.4% of the total assets under management. As a result, the total inflow has now reached $1.32 billion this year, although well behind 2021 and 2020, which saw $10.7 billion and $6.6 billion respectively. CoinShares’ latest report reveals that weekly inflow into Ethereum products dropped by an astounding 93.27% from $49.1 million to $3.3 million. Solana on the other hand, increased by almost 10% from $12.4 million to $13.6 million. Other altcoins also struggled to receive major inflows, with Litecoin and XRP only registering inflows of $0.4 million and $0.5 million respectively. Uniswap and Polygon saw minor outflows of $0.55 million and $0.86 million respectively. Factors Influencing The Inflow Most cryptocurrencies went through a brief period of consolidation last week, but this didn’t roll over into investment products. The report from Coinshares attributes the inflows into Bitcoin in particular to a strong bullish sentiment related to the impending approval of a spot-based Bitcoin ETF in the US. This is particularly evident, as Short-Bitcoin outflows saw another outflow of $8.5 million last week. Amid these influences and a 101% price surge last month, Solana has seen growth in other aspects of its ecosystem that may have attracted institutional investors. For one, Solana has delivered one of the most impressive performances on TVL in the most recent months. Data from DeFiLlama puts the total TVL on the network at $576.44 million, a 77.62% increase in the past month. The platform also revealed a spike in SOL trading volume on decentralized exchanges in the past week.

42409408,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHHNw,1700562761,Fed Minutes Release May Be a Non-Event for Bitcoin,"The minutes of the Nov. 1 Fed meeting might look outdated and potential hawkish commentary may not affect markets, including bitcoin.  Post-meeting weakness in U.S. economic data has convinced traders that the Fed's rate-hike cycle has ended.  The minutes of the Federal Reserve's November meeting, a closely watched record offering clues about the direction of monetary policy and its potential impact on the economy and markets, will be made public at 19:00 UTC (14:00 ET).  At the Nov. 1 meeting, the Fed kept the benchmark interest rate steady in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, having last lifted it in July. During the post-meeting press conference, Chairman Jerome Powell said the persistent strength in the labor market and consumer spending may warrant more liquidity tightening, a bearish prospect for risk assets such as cryptocurrencies.  While the minutes due later today are likely to take a similar line, they may not elicit a reaction from financial markets. That's because weak U.S. economic data released since the meeting have bolstered expectations the central bank is done raising rates. In other words, the November meeting minutes may simply be outdated.  Release of the minutes ""is likely to be less market-moving than usual, given the post-meeting softness in data,"" analysts at ING said in a Nov. 17 note to clients. ""We have already heard from several Fed officials who have welcomed the direction of the numbers but commented that they want to see more of the same to be sure that inflation is on the path to 2%.""  The Labor Department's employment report released Nov. 3 showed that job creation slowed to 150,000 jobs in October from 297,000 in September. The jobless rate rose to 3.9% while wage growth, measured by average hourly earnings, softened, signaling continued disinflation ahead. Data released last week showed the U.S. consumer price index grew a slower-than-expected 3.2% year-on-year in October, down from 3.7% in September.  Since then, according to Fed funds futures, traders have brought forward expectations of interest-rate cuts to May. Bitcoin is known to closely follow changes in fiat liquidity conditions.  Some observers, including Citi, agree the November meeting minutes are dated but say comments on the recent easing of financial conditions or availability of funding in the economy warrant attention. Tighter financial conditions affect households' and firms' saving and investment plans and weigh on economic growth and risk assets. Easy conditions have the opposite effect.  The recent easing in financial conditions runs counter to the Fed's effort to contain inflation with tighter policy and may see the Fed add hawkish commentary to the minutes.  ""Minutes from the November FOMC meeting may be most revealing regarding Fed officials' attitude toward financial conditions,"" Citi analysts wrote on Nov. 19. ""In October, Chair Powell and his colleagues argued that higher 10-year Treasury yields would substitute for further policy rate hikes. But as financial conditions have loosened, the response has been asymmetric, with little push-back against lower rates and higher equity prices.""  ""Minutes are compiled after the meeting, meaning officials might include some hawkish hints that conditions will need to remain tighter-for-longer to bring inflation lower,"" the analysts added, while noting the market reaction may be limited.  Credit Agricole U.S. economist Nicholas Van Ness voiced a somewhat similar opinion.

Increasing user participation or diverse use cases contribute to network's stability. Consistency in transaction volume, active addresses, and gas usage indicate resilience and community engagement. Investment Thesis Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) network has been stable while its market price has decreased. We are not likely to see volatility in ETH future market in short term. On-Chain Data Shows That Ethereum Network is stable The network appears to be doing well when looking at Ethereum's distinct address chart and seeing a consistent rise in the total number of unique addresses over time. The growing number of addresses in the Ethereum network suggests continued development and adoption despite price swings. Several factors could contribute to this phenomenon: Increasing User Participation: As the number of addresses rises, it appears that more people or organizations are using the Ethereum network, either as users or as components of smart contracts and decentralized apps (DApps). Diverse Use Cases: The Ethereum blockchain can be used for a number of purposes, including non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Users with a range of needs are drawn to the numerous applications, which supports overall growth. Long-Term Confidence: The growth of unique addresses amid price declines might be interpreted as a sign of long-term confidence in the potential and usefulness of the Ethereum network, which goes beyond transient market swings. The total number of Ethereum unique addresses does not affect ETH price directly but it suggests that the network is growing. The chart shows the total distinct numbers of address on the Ethereum blockchain and the increase in the number of address daily. (etherscan) The slight decline of the daily transaction volume on the Ethereum network is indicative of transaction activity. That is a negative indication of the system's resilience and its market price because ETH daily transaction volume has positive correlation with its price. This is frequently taken into account while assessing the network's strength and scalability. However, the rise in ERC20 token transfers may indicate that investors and consumers are enthusiastic about the projects and markets that are built around the ERC20 token standard. This could have to do with the advancement of initiatives and software developed on the Ethereum platform. These metrics demonstrate a lively and constructive community within Ethereum, which is crucial for the network's and its ecosystem's growth and success. However, we should also notice that the increase in token transfer would be a sale off on the network which can potentially make the market price drop further. The chart highlights the total number of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain with daily individual breakdown for average difficulty, estimated hash rate, average block time and size, total block and uncle block count and total new address seen. (etherscan) The chart shows the number of ERC20 tokens transferred daily. (etherscan) The number of active Ethereum addresses has gradually decreased since 2021. This is not a good sign for ETH because Ethereum active addresses and its market price has a positive correlation. However, an encouraging indicator is the consistency of the quantity of ERC20 addresses. This consistency is frequently a result of the persistence and engaged usage of the Ethereum network by its user base. The reliability and durability of the system may be indicated by a steady number of active addresses. Additionally, it serves as a gauge of how frequently and enthusiastically the user base uses the Ethereum network to conduct projects and transactions. One crucial indicator of community engagement and platform utilization on Ethereum is the consistency of the quantity of ERC20 addresses. The Active Ethereum Address chart shows the daily number of unique addresses that were active on the network as a sender or receiver. (etherscan) The ERC20 Address chart shows the daily number of unique addresses that were active on the network as a ERC20 token sender or receiver. (etherscan) Notable is the daily amount of pending transactions on the Ethereum network, which is kept at a steady 150k. A steady amount of pending transactions indicates that the network is meeting demand for transactions and is not going over capacity. To ensure prompt and effective processing, avoid network congestion, and preserve a good user experience, there must be a steady amount of pending transactions. It shows that there are no appreciable delays or backlogs in the Ethereum network's ability to handle the transaction load. A consistent amount of pending transactions signifies the resilience of the network and its capacity to manage transaction load efficiently, hence augmenting the overall dependability of the Ethereum network. This dashboard tracks the average number of pending transactions per day on the Ethereum network. (etherscan) One noteworthy finding is the concurrent rise in Ethereum's daily gas consumption. The amount of computing work or resources needed to process transactions and carry out smart contracts on the Ethereum network is measured by gas utilization. An increase in daily gas usage could imply several things: Growing Activity: The Ethereum network may be being used by more people or decentralized applications (DApps), which would raise the need for processing power. Complexity of Transactions: It's possible that as smart contracts or transactions become more complicated, they need more processing power, which in turn uses more gas. Network Upgrades or Changes: Upgrades or modifications to the protocol may have an effect on how much gas is used. The Ethereum Daily Gas Used Chart shows the historical total daily gas used of the Ethereum network. (etherscan) It is essential to monitor the correlation between the amount of outstanding transactions and the daily gas use. A steady stream of pending transactions is a good thing, but a steady rise in gas use points to a vibrant ecology. It is imperative to guarantee that the network can withstand the heightened demand without sacrificing the speed or efficiency of transactions. The rise in Ethereum's daily gas consumption highlights the dynamic character of the Ethereum ecosystem by pointing to increased network activity or complexity. However, Ethereum has no advantage regarding transaction fee in comparison to other blockchains. Market Activity Is Not Very Intense The observation that ETH open interest has increased and then traded sideways over the past two weeks is notable. Taking a closer look at the long and short volumes, both have experienced significant decreases during this period. Meanwhile, USD interest and ETH interest have remained stable. This indicates that the market sentiment is not overly optimistic, and future traders are exercising caution in opening new positions. Consequently, the ETH price is less likely to exhibit volatility in the short term. This is because there will be less long and short liquidation which directly has effect on the market price. ETH Open Interest (datamish) ETH Long Position and USD Interest Rate (datamish) ETH Short Position and ETH Interest Rate (datamish) Looking at Ethereum's price chart, we see that price has formed the falling wedge. The price action has a strong support at $1,400 when encountering another resistance at $2,400. So, ETH price would likely trade within the rectangle of $1,200 - $2,400 until there is a catalyst for a break up or down. Falling wedge suggest Ethereum price could go up further. (Tradingview) In conclusion, the Ethereum network has expanded despite a recent decline in its market value. In addition, ETH open interest indicates that market activity is not very intense which makes Ethereum price tends to be not volatile in short time. Therefore, I rate ""hold"" for Ethereum at the moment.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4653349-ethereum-short-term-volatility-unlikely?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20492950.jpeg

I have a small position in Bitcoin and follow the sector closely, and I believe now is a decent time to add. The recent shift to an inverse relationship with global equities reinforces this idea as a portfolio hedge. Main Thesis/Background The purpose of this article is to discuss the alternative cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC-USD) as an investment option at the current market price. Many retail investors have been closely following BTC - and other cryptos - for a long time and have certainly seen both the rewards and the potential for sharp losses. I will say straight out that these are investments that aren't for everyone given the nature of them and their volatility. But, for the right investor, the large swings offers the potential for both diversification and handsome gains. I have a very small position in BTC myself, but I follow the broader sector closely along with many out of curiosity on where it is headed. Is this truly a revolutionary trend, or one that will eventually crash and burn? It has been fun to watch and will continue to be. It is worth noting I am not a crypto ""loyalist"" so to speak, and won't use this review to espouse why this is a ""sure thing"" investment that everyone needs to get in to. Rather, I use this position as a way to diversify and, more recently, to hedge my bets on a more dovish Fed and weaker dollar 2024. For perspective, I last wrote about BTC directly over a year ago. At that time I was not actually very bullish on the currency, and placed a ""hold"" rating on it. This turned out to be a reasonable call because, despite the coin's recent surge, it is still down almost 10% since that article was written: Bitcoin Performance (Seeking Alpha) Obviously, a lot has happened since then, so I felt now was as good a time as any to do an updated review. With 2024 approaching rapidly, do more gains lie ahead for BTC, or are we on the verge of another correction? Personally, I see merit to owning/starting a position at these levels, and I will explain why in greater detail below. What's Behind The Recent Climb? To begin this review I want to take a moment to reflect on the macro-story for BTC over the next year. While there have been ups and downs, in the shorter term this investment has done extremely well. In fact, in 2023, BTC has more than doubled - obviously a move that any investor would welcome! YTD Gains (Google Finance) As you can see, the market (as measured by large-cap stocks) is also up strongly, but BTC easily takes the cake. This tells me that an examination of the why behind this surge is very relevant to determine if more gains are even feasible. After all, when any investment doubles, I believe one should take time to reflect on what has changed and whether a portfolio adjustment is required. So - why has BTC been rallying? The answer to this is multi-fold. I certainly won't cover all the reasons in this article, but I will touch on some of the main points. The first is that inflation has been on the decline, not just in the US but worldwide. BTC, and cryptocurrencies more broadly, can be seen by some as a dollar/traditional currency hedge much in the way that gold or crude oil are. This means that as developed market currencies (especially the USD) weaken, that can act as a bullish catalyst for BTC: Annual Inflation (Developed Markets) (World Bank) This is a trend that is likely to continue as economic readings show weakness in both the US and EU-zone in particular. If inflation continues a decline, the Fed and other central banks can stop hiking interest rates. That can bode well for risk-on assets and currency alternatives like BTC. A second reason for the bull run is the possibility of the first spot BTC ETF being approved by U.S. regulators. Last month, Grayscale filed a new application that would allow its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product to function as a spot Bitcoin ETF. At present, it trades in futures. The implication here is that by offering a SEC-approved ETF it will do a number of things. It will boost the legitimacy of the investment. This could widen its appeal - especially among more cautious retail investors (I include myself in this equation). If so, it will drive demand and the price higher. Further, it could result in additional ETF filings by other fund managers - if the Grayscale effort succeeds. More options, more availability, more likely to push prices higher. A third reason for BTC's rise is that much of last year's bad news is starting to fade. Investors likely remember that crypto as a whole took it on the chin for most of 2022. This is why, despite BTC more than doubling in 2023, it is still posting a negative return since my 2022 article. Much of this stemmed from upheaval in the broader sector, with negative headlines, exchanges being shut down, and lawsuits flying around. Think back to the FTX bankruptcy and the arrest of CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. This was a huge deal that shattered confidence and caused some investors to reduce their exposure across the crypto universe. The conclusion I draw from all this is that investors had plenty of reasons to be jittery in 2022 and early 2023 too. I am not suggesting some of these macro-headwinds have gone away completely - they haven't - but investor sentiment can be fleeting. Much of this bad news seems ""old"" now, and the market is likely looking ahead to better times rather than focusing on past negativity. This is surely driving part of the rebound this year after a terrible 2022. How Is BTC Useful Going Forward? I have covered a few fundamental reasons for why BTC has climbed so strongly in the past year. But the more important story at the moment is what could sent BTC even higher . After all, past gains are only that - in the past. What the future holds is what concerns us now. So - why is BTC still a relevant asset to hold in one's portfolio? Personally, I think the usefulness of BTC has increased in the short-term for a key reason. The correlation between BTC and global stocks has shifted negative again. This means the two asset classes are moving inversely (on average), which is actually a central reason to why I started a position in the first place: BTC's Correlation to Stocks (Yahoo Finance) This is a main driver for me to stay invested because it reverses a trend I viewed negatively last year. When BTC's correlation to stocks began to rise, which I touched on in my 2022 article, I saw less usefulness for the asset. I wanted an asset that was going to protect me against some equity volatility, just like bonds, gold, oil, and the utilities sector can often do. When BTC began moving lock-step with stocks, I saw this aspect for investing in it diminishing. Now, based on recent performance, this trend has changed and BTC is once again acting in a way different from stocks. This doesn't mean that BTC will move higher or perform well, but it does mean it is helping to diversify my portfolio in a stronger fashion. That piques my interest for it, and I'm sure it does for other investors as well. A Lot Of Momentum From Many Buyers Another reason to be a BTC bull right now is that investor buying is only beginning to pick up steam recently. After weeks and months of net outflows, buyers are stepping up in a big way, driving gains across the whole sector: Weekly Crypto Asset Flows (CoinShares) And the good news is the buy-side is diverse. According to the data compiled by the exchange, the largest inflows were from Canada, Germany and Switzerland, with the US accounting for 12% of the inflows. This shows that the trend is a global one. The fact that it is gaining steam is great for momentum buyers in the short-term. Skeptical Minds Are A Tailwind My final point for the time being is that general distrust (or perhaps frustration with) of the global financial system is helping to support valuations of ""alternative"" forms of currencies and payment systems. This is a bit of a trend not just in the US, but globally, as more people feel disillusioned with traditional banking and financial systems. This is due to a number of factors, but high profile regional bank failures , persistent inflation, and a growing wealth gap are all contributing to it. Let's look at the US as an example first. Domestically, ""trust"" in the government is at historic lows. This extends to both the state and federal governments, but also the other institutions that are supposed to represent the public's interest - like the Federal Reserve or the US Treasury: Public's Trust in Government (USA) (Pew Research Center) And this skepticism extends beyond just the ""government"". A poll conducted by the Associated Press earlier this year revealed the following: 10% of Americans say they have high confidence in the nation's banking institutions, 57% do have some confidence; 31% have hardly any."" Source: Associated Press What this adds up to (in my opinion) is that investors are continuously searching for the next ""alternative"" to traditional forms of government and banking. Bitcoin is not just fulfilling an investment craving, it is attracting people who want some way to rebel against the institutions they do not trust. With little on the horizon to improve the government's standing in the public's eye, I believe this reality remains a tailwind going in to 2024. Bottom line Bitcoin has been on a roller coaster the past two years, but 2023 has been very kind to it and other cryptos. While I reiterate this is a very volatile asset and is not for the risk-averse, I do see the potential for continued gains ahead. BTC is benefiting from wider adoption, a renewed negative correlation with equities, and interest due to the public's distrust on traditional institutions and norms. Add this all up and I have to conclude the risk-reward proposition is favorable here. As a result, I am considering adding to my position at these levels, and suggest my readers give this idea some thought at this time.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4653346-bitcoin-reasons-to-stay-long-despite-rally?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20492705.jpeg

BTC traded just over $37,500 in European morning hours Tuesday, adding 0.6%. Ether (ETH) lost 0.5%, while dogecoin (DOGE) and solana (SOL) slumped as much as 5% as traders likely took profits.  BNB Chain’s [BNB] tokens were up as much as 8% amid reports that crypto exchange Binance, which initially issued the tokens, could soon be paying $4 billion to settle multiple U.S. criminal charges.  Some traders expect bitcoin to trade sideways in the coming weeks as its recent rally is running into headwinds caused by uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s next steps and due to delays in a key regulatory decision about ETFs.  “The upside has been suppressed at the $38,000 psychological level,” analysts at the Japanese exchange bitbank led by Yukari Kusu shared in a Tuesday note. “One of the reasons why bitcoin failed to breach that level is the SEC’s decision to postpone its decision to approve or disapprove Hasdex’s bitcoin ETF on Thursday.”  Meanwhile, analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex said in a Tuesday note that they expected the Fed to hold rates steady in the December meeting.  “Headline inflation has declined remarkably from 6.4 percent at the beginning of the year. This should give the Fed enough room to hold rates steady in its December meeting, in line with current expectations in the Fed Futures market,” the analysts shared. “This would also align with its goal of sustaining economic expansion.”  “However, this pause in rate hikes doesn't signal a change in the Fed's broader tightening policy. The central bank remains cautious and ready to adjust rates if inflation persists or unexpectedly increases,” they added.  Interest rate decisions have the tendency to move markets. Higher rates usually mean risk assetss such as stocks and cryptocurrencies take a hit as investors could take profits and invest in bonds.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE | SOL,BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/21/bitcoin-faces-headwinds-as-etf-optimism-stalls-doge-sol-give-back-gains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/72ae280e7f877c015503d0e65549a58cf333d430-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tether deposited the funds with a subsidiary of investment bank Britannia Financial, according to the report, which cited filings made in the High Court.  Britannia Financial is engaged in a legal dispute with British Virgin Islands-registered Arbitral International, which alleges that Britannia failed to pay the full price for a Bahamas brokerage it bought from Arbitral in June 2021.  Arbitral says it is entitled to extra money from assets generated by the business in the year following the sale, according to an agreement between the two firms. According to the report, Britannia claims that Tether deposited the funds with its subsidiary, Britannia Global Markets, and the transaction is therefore unrelated to the brokerage it bought from Arbitral.  Tether's USDT is the world's largest stablecoin, providing crypto users with a hedge against the volatility that often besets cryptocurrencies.

On-chain analysis identifies the key reasons that could propel BTC prices higher this week. Bitcoin was up 1.77% and was halfway to the vaunted $38,000 level at the time of writing, with its trading volume soaring 21% to a little over $14 billion. The recent gains in the crypto’s price have also helped it to erase some of its recent losses, as evidenced by a surge of around 0.55% in its price over the last seven days. Anticipation Of Bitcoin ETF Nod This increase is a reflection of the market’s rising hope for the US government to approve a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. But the SEC is still on the fence, putting off judgments on many Bitcoin ETF proposals until 2024. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to generate significant discussion on social media, despite the SEC failing to meet the designated eight-day timeframe for approving spot Bitcoin ETFs. Source: FXStreet However, a recent explanation for the delays has emerged, suggesting that the financial regulator has shown a preference for cash-based creations of ETFs rather than cryptocurrency-based ones. It is also believed that the agency is actively communicating with exchanges over this matter. Bitcoin Gets Price Lift From Milei Win Bitcoin’s latest price ascent was in part driven by the election of Javier Milei, a politician who supports the adoption of bitcoin, as the President of Argentina. Nevertheless, several traders caution about a potential market response subsequent to the disclosure of Federal Reserve meeting minutes on Tuesday, anticipating a period of reduced market liquidity towards the conclusion of the current business week. Related Reading: Sam Altman’s Worldcoin Token Makes Headlines With 24% Surge Amid OpenAI Drama Anticipations are high for a forthcoming week of notable activity within the cryptocurrency sphere, as discerned by market participants who foresee a series of events and announcements capable of influencing market trajectories. BTCUSD trading at $37,424 today. Chart: TradingView.com Eminent eToro markets analyst, Simon Peters, underscored the imminent release of the Fed’s latest meeting notes, slated for tomorrow. Peters articulated the consequential nature of these minutes, portraying them as a conduit for acquiring profound insights into the prevailing perspectives of the central bank. Against the backdrop of a decelerating inflationary trajectory, investors are particularly attuned to discerning further substantiation affirming the prospect that the present juncture may signify the culmination of peak interest rates. BTC seven-day price action: Source: Coingecko What Lies Ahead For Bitcoin This forthcoming week beckons vigilant attention as participants await the nuanced signals that may resonate throughout the broader landscape of the market. Meanwhile, based on a deeper look at the daily chart, it is evident that there is currently a bullish sentiment surrounding the price of Bitcoin as it approaches a critical resistance level. If the closing bar lines up close to that threshold, the impending test of this resistance level points to a possible breakout situation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fees Soar Above Ethereum’s As Investors Flock To Ordinals-Backed Assets The excitement that is building up in this situation might be the impetus for a significant spike that takes the top altcoin’s price up to $39,000.

20488676,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561692,1700554556,Spot Bitcoin ETF Is ‘A Buy The News’ Event: Pantera Capital CEO,"The potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States has stirred considerable attention in recent weeks. Dan Morehead, CEO and founder of Pantera Capital, has now shared valuable insights on this matter in his latest “Blockchain Letter”, emphasizing the unique circumstances surrounding this event. Morehead challenges the traditional Wall Street mantra, “Buy the rumor, sell the news,” questioning its relevance in the current spot ETF context. He reflects on how this adage played out historically, specifically citing the CME Futures launch and Coinbase’s public listing. Both instances exhibited significant price surges in the BTC market before their respective events, followed by steep downturns, aligning with the adage’s prediction. Spot Bitcoin ETF Is A “Buy The Rumor, Buy The News” Event In his detailed analysis, Morehead recounts how the Bitcoin market rallied dramatically, up to 2,448%, leading up to the CME futures launch. However, this bullish trend abruptly reversed on the very day the futures were listed, marking the start of an 84% decline into a bear market. He parallels this with the Coinbase public listing scenario, where the market again surged, this time by 848%, reaching its peak on the day of Coinbase’s listing, only to be succeeded by a 76% drop. Related Reading: Clear Skies: Why Bitcoin Overhead Resistance Is Weak Morehead, with a touch of humor, notes in his letter, “Will someone please remind me the day before the Bitcoin ETF officially launches? I might want to take some chips off the table.” However, “this time is different,” states Morehead. Further delving into the potential impact of a spot ETF, he posits that such an ETF would represent a significant step in the adoption. Unlike futures, which he argues were a “step backwards,” the spot ETF could fundamentally change access to BTC, opening up new investor pools and potentially altering the demand function for Bitcoin permanently. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Hype: Bloomberg Intelligence Envisions $100 Billion Market With Regulatory Approval Unlike the previous events of the CME futures and Coinbase listing, which had little real-world impact on Bitcoin accessibility, Morehead believes the spot ETF scenario is fundamentally different. He asserts, “A BlackRock ETF fundamentally changes access to Bitcoin. It will have a huge (positive) impact.” His view is that the ETF will introduce BTC to broader investor classes, significantly altering the investment landscape. Drawing a parallel with the history of gold ETFs, Morehead suggests that Bitcoin ETFs could similarly revolutionize Bitcoin investment, expanding its appeal and legitimacy. He predicts a substantial shift in the demand dynamics for Bitcoin, akin to how gold ETFs altered the gold market. In his concluding remarks, Morehead revisits the initial question about the ETF launch being a “sell the news” event. He argues, “Buy the rumor, buy the news.” This phrase encapsulates his belief that, unlike past events, the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF will not lead to a sell-off but will mark the beginning of a new era in Bitcoin investment.

42409457,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHPoM,1700554149,New Ethereum Layer 2 Blast Attracts $30M Hours After Bridge Goes Live,"Investors have bridged over $30 million in ether and stablecoins to Blast, the latest Ethereum layer 2 network, just hours after the project went live late on Monday.  The inflow is evidence of strong demand for Layer 2 networks or protocols that operate on top of a layer 1 blockchain, such as Ethereum, to reduce bottlenecks related to speed, cost and scalability. Bridges are blockchain-based tools that allow users to transfer tokens between different networks.  Also driving the charm is Blast's unique design: Depositors start earning yields on the transferred ether alongside BLAST points.  “Blast natively participates in ETH staking, and the staking yield is passed back to the L2’s users and dapps,” the team said in a post Tuesday. ‘We’ve redesigned the L2 from the ground up so that if you have 1 ETH in your wallet on Blast, over time, it grows to 1.04, 1.08, 1.12 ETH automatically.”  Users have to wait until the launch of the mainnet in February before they can withdraw any funds from the network or participate in on-chain activities. As such, Blast is invite-only as of Tuesday, requiring a code from invited users to gain access. Besides, the BLAST points can be redeemed starting in May.  Of the total funds bridged, data shows over $19 million in ether has been staked on Lido, where it is set to earn as much as 4% annualized yield. Another $3 million is on Maker, while a smaller tranche of $150,000 in dai (DAI) stablecoins sits idle in the wallet.  Users who bridge stablecoins receive Blast’s auto-rebasing stablecoin, USDB. The yield for USDB comes from MakerDAO’s on-chain T-Bill protocol.  Blast raised over $20 million in a round led by Paradigm and Standard Crypto and is headed by pseudonymous figurehead @PacmanBlur, one of the co-founders of NFT marketplace Blur.  @PacmanBlur said in a separate post that Blast was an extension of the Blur ecosystem, letting Blur users earn yields on idle assets while improving the technical aspects required to offer sophisticated NFT products to users.

42409430,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHOxS,1700553304,Celsius to Transition to Mining-Only NewCo After SEC Feedback in Updated Bankruptcy Plan,"Crypto lender Celsius will transition to a new company that focuses only on mining bitcoin, a shift from an earlier reorganization plan that included a focus on staking too, it announced in a court filing late Monday.  The move comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave feedback ""on certain aspects of the Plan."" On Monday, a few hours before the Celsius announcement, CoinDesk reported that the court-approved reorganization plan had hit a speed bump because the SEC wanted more information about the assets of the former crypto lender.  A Judge earlier handed the implementation of Celsius's reorganization to Fahrenheit Holdings, a group that includes Arrington Capital and crypto miner U.S. Bitcoin Corp. Fahrenheit won a bid to acquire Celsius in May 2023. The plan was to see the creation of a new company registered in Delaware, currently referred to in filings as NewCo, usually a term used to describe a corporate spinoff before it is assigned a final name. The company was to focus on mining and staking, according to the court-approved plan.  ""In the coming weeks, the Debtors intend to file a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to approve modifications to the Plan to reflect the new Mining NewCo transaction,"" the filing said. ""The Debtors do not believe that these modifications will require resolicitation of the Plan. The Debtors still anticipate that distributions to creditors will commence in January of 2024.""  The SEC's feedback resulted in ""Celsius now intending to begin the process to apply to register the shares in a new publicly traded Bitcoin mining company that will be owned by Celsius customers (the “Mining NewCo”)."" Bitcoin Mining was the core business of the proposed new company, but the SEC's ""feedback"" appears to have led stakeholders to determine that ""certain"" assets that were to be transferred to Fahrenheit Holdings will now, ""for regulatory reasons, be retained by Celsius’s estates to be administered and monetized by the Plan Administrator and/or Litigation Administrator for the benefit of creditors.""

On Polymarket, shares of the Yes side of the contract ""Sam back as CEO of OpenAI"" are currently trading at 55 cents, representing a market belief that the Yes side has a 55% chance of being correct. That's a significant upward revision from the 10% probability priced 24 hours ago.  Altman, the chief executive of the artificial intelligence startup behind ChatGPT, was forced out of his role over the weekend reportedly due to lack of consistency in candidate communications with the board.  Since Altman's expulsion, OpenAI has been facing a significant internal revolt, with most employees demanding the resignation of three directors, following the controversial removal of CEO Sam Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman, leading to a potential leadership change and questioning the company's future direction, the Financial Times reported.  Meanwhile, Bloomberg said OpenAI is engaged in intensive negotiations to resolve internal conflicts and reunite its team following the controversial dismissal of CEO Sam Altman and the interim appointment of Emmett Shear, amidst employee threats to quit and efforts by investors and Microsoft to reinstate Altman potentially.  As the Monday business day in the U.S. dragged on and backroom corporate politics continued, the Yes side went as low as 18 cents by mid-day before rising back up to 50 cents, then hovering between 48 and 53 as the afternoon wore on. Later, it flipped again in late American hours as Bloomberg published its story.  So far, traders have bet $210,579 in this contract alone, with liquidity surging in the past 24 hours.  At the same time, another Polymarket contract, with much less liquidity, asked betters if Emmet Shear – appointed to replace Altman – would be the CEO of OpenAI by week's end.  The Yes side of that contract is currently trading for 68 cents and went as low as 32 cents during Monday's U.S. trading hours.  Aside from the ongoing competition for OpenAI's top job, The Information reported that FTX-backed Anthropic's CEO Dario Amodei rejected a merger offer from OpenAI's board, which included replacing Altman as CEO, amidst negotiations complicated by FTX's $500 million stake in Anthropic and legal issues surrounding the exchange's bankruptcy last November.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/21/polymarket-traders-betting-on-sam-altmans-fate-have-become-bipolar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05e3504a0e11a55cefb7e92050365120e03cde06-2708x2022.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409440,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHPHI,1700549161,FTX-Backed Anthropic’s CEO Declined OpenAI's Merger Offer: The Information,"FTX-backed artificial intelligence company Anthropic's CEO and co-founder Dario Amodei declined an offer from OpenAI's board of directors to merge, according to a report by The Information which cited a ""person with direct knowledge.""  The proposal came after OpenAI fired CEO Sam Altman on Friday and the deal had a sweetener – For Amodei to replace Altman as CEO, which he also turned down due to his position at Anthropic, according to the report.  ""It’s not clear whether the merger proposal led to any serious discussion,"" the report said.  Later, Reuters also reported the offers were made and declined, citing two people briefed on the matter.  FTX bought a stake in Anthropic supposedly worth $500 million, according to an internal document circulated before last November’s bankruptcy filing. FTX's bankruptcy trustee has yet to sell the stake.  The AI firm's several fundraising efforts recently raised hopes that FTX creditors may receive a larger payout should the stake be sold. The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that the $500 million investment in Anthropic in 2022 came from customer funds.  OpenAI and Anthropic didn't immediately respond to CoinDesk's requests for comment.  OpenAI's board of directors sacked Altman last week because they no longer had confidence in him to continue leading the company. Microsoft quickly announced that Altman would lead a new advanced AI research team. This has been followed by threats to resign from OpenAI's employees and attempts by OpenAI's major investors to reinstate Altman.

Until 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is deferring decisions on several Bitcoin ETF applications, despite the market’s increasing optimism about the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. This hesitation has coincided with a remarkable surge in the top crypto’s average transaction fees, soaring over 1,000% to reach a peak of $18.67 on November 16, according to BitInfoCharts data. The average daily transaction fees for BTC, totaling $37,370, have seen a reversal with Ethereum. This change comes in the wake of heightened activity related to Ordinals on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Fees Hit Highest Point In 6 Months During the observed trend, it became evident that Bitcoin’s average daily trading fee experienced a noteworthy surge, reaching its highest point in the past six months on November 16, where it peaked at $18.67. This spike in transaction fees within the Bitcoin network indicated a moment of heightened activity and demand. In contrast, over the same period, Ethereum’s transaction fees registered at $7.90, showcasing a relatively lower level compared to Bitcoin. The divergence in fee dynamics between the two prominent cryptocurrencies underscores the distinct market forces and user behaviors influencing their respective blockchain networks. Bitcoin has outpaced Ethereum in daily fees in the last five days. Source: BitInfoCharts This fluctuation underscores the dynamic nature of transaction fees in the cryptocurrency space, with Bitcoin experiencing notable shifts in its fee landscape. Contrary to worries about the potential deterrent effect of elevated transaction fees on Bitcoin users, on-chain data suggests a contrasting trend.

42409449,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHPhk,1700548052,Tokens In SEC's CrossHairs Are Posting Double Digit Year-To-Date Returns,"In its suit against Kraken, the SEC has doubled down on allegations that a number of high-profile tokens are securities  Many of these tokens have posted double-digit gains year-to-date as traders shake off regulatory uncertainty.  Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is once again in the crosshairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As part of this suit, the Commission is alleging that the exchange dealt in what they consider securities without proper registration, reiterating its belief that top tokens like Solana's SOL and Cardano's ADA are securities.  ""Kraken currently makes available for trading crypto assets that have been the subject of prior SEC enforcement actions based upon their status as crypto asset securities,"" the suit reads.  Although many would think that being named by the SEC in enforcement actions time and time again would be a sort of scarlet letter for tokens and would lead to depressed prices, market data shows that's not the case.  Perhaps a lesson to take away from this is that traders value technical capability over regulatory compliance – or they understand that the SEC is not the only regulator on the planet.  According to on-chain data, many named tokens have outperformed bitcoin as part of a broader market rally. The 'basket' of these tokens is up an average of 41%.  Solana's SOL is up nearly 463% year-to-date. In June, when the SEC first accused SOL of being an unregistered security, the Solana Foundation quickly hit back to deny the accusations, and, as CoinDesk reported at the time, the developer community was largely indifferent.  While there isn't a specific catalyst to build hype around SOL, the market appears to be very receptive to things like positive comments from ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood that ""Solana is even faster and cost-effective than Ether"" and Grayscale's Solana Trust (GSOL) having a 900% premium over spot prices – indicative of institutional demand for the token.  Meanwhile, Cardano's ADA is up over 50% as Cardano's blockchain transactions increased by 49% in Q2 due to network upgrades and new user attraction, despite a drop in active daily users, with notable growth in data load and developer interest.  Over the last few months, the NEAR Foundation's NEAR token has also seen a series of positive headlines, likely increasing investor interest to counterbalance the SEC's allegations. As CoinDesk recently reported, NEAR rallied following its partnership announcement with Nym Technologies, aimed at integrating Nym's privacy infrastructure into the Near ecosystem to enhance user privacy for NFTs, DeFi, and dApps.  However, not all of these named tokens are squarely in the green. Market data shows that some tokens like Cosmos' ATOM are in the red, with ATOM down 4% year-to-date.  The Cosmos blockchain, once a pioneer in interoperability and decentralized applications, faced this year an existential crisis due to Terra's collapse, rising competition from Ethereum, as well as internal community challenges, CoinDesk reported in July, and this dampened enthusiasm for the protocol is likely reflected in ATOM's price.",POSITIVE,ADA | SOL,ADA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/21/tokens-in-secs-crosshairs-are-posting-double-digit-year-to-date-returns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f775081eaaf6db92b22b17751a2ac84ecfaa3d8-2048x1046.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The result of this continuous climb is the fact that the open interest has now surged to May 2022 levels, a development that could spell a massive rally for the price. AVAX Open Interest Surge To $224 Million According to data from Coinglass, the AVAX open interest has now climbed to $224 million. The website shows that there was an over 10% increase in the open interest in a 24-hour period which brought the total open interest above 10.04 million AVAX. Related Reading: Cardano Falling Wedge Pattern: Analyst Predicts 100% Increase Following Breakout Binance actually commands almost half of the total of this open interest at 4.48 million AVAX worth a little over $100 million. This suggests that a good portion of the demand is coming from the crypto exchange. The total open interest also saw a 9.94% increase in the 24 hour period. Source: CoinGlass ByBit exchange accounts for the second-largest open interest at 2.04 million AVAX worth $46.09 million. BingX comes in third place with 1.24 million AVAX worth $27.59.

The largest jump in open interest was recorded on the Bitmex exchange as it rose 17.78% to bring the crypto exchange’s total open interest to 55,340 AVAX with $1.53 million. Altogether, the open interest in the altcoin has risen from $82.8 million on October 20 to $224 million on November 20, meaning that the open interest has grown 170% in one month. Token price holds above $22 | Source: AVAXUSD on Tradingview.com Can Price Cross $30? The last time that the AVAX open interest was this high, the price was trading much higher which opens the possibility of a rally above $30. As Coinglass data shows, the last time that the open interest crossed $220 million was in May 2022 when the price was still trading above $50. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Tops 19-Month High: Historical Data Shows What To Expect Also, taking a look at AVAX’s historical performance, it shows that whenever the open interest has risen quickly, the price tends to follow suit. This was the case back in August 2021 when the open interest went from $14.53 million to $123.5 million, and the AVAX price rose accordingly from $19.15 to $55. If the same trend were to take place here, then $30 may only be a starting point for the AVAX price. Following all historical performances, the current volume of open interest puts the AVAX fair price at around $40, meaning the altcoin could be trading well below its fair value.
