""This means that the suspicions concerning our client in relation to the alleged fraud and money laundering could not be substantiated,"" states a press release from the firm of Röhl-Dehm & Partner. ""Our client is now in the process of preparing to make  the first payments from the German account.""  The release adds, ""For the time being these payments may only be made to those customers who have made payments into the account at Commerzbank and have not conducted any business with Bitcoins. In the course of the coming weeks we shall send messages to these customers and ask them to provide the information requested in these messages to enable the payments to be made.""  Bitcoin-24 went offline in April after authorities closed its German and Polish bank accounts.  As of today, the Polish account remains closed.  ""We must ask customers with credit balances in the Polish account for a little more patience,"" notes the statement from Röhl-Dehm & Partner, adding that the firm expects a response from Polish authorities on Monday.  With the latest developments, there are some signs the exchange could be planning to relaunch. On Wednesday, Bitcoin-24 tweeted a website screenshot of what it says will be ""BTC24 2.0"". A May 15 tweet also indicated the company was looking to hire a new PHP/Javascript programmer.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SPONSORED,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/31/seizure-lifted-on-bitcoin-24s-german-accounts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424922,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX2Rh,1370012415,"Give me Liberty, or give me five to ten: The CoinDesk Weekly Review","Fans of irony will not have missed the way that Arthur Budovsky, head honcho at ""private currency exchange"" Liberty Reserve had his own liberty severely reserved earlier this week. His collar was felt in Spain at the same time as the Costa Rican site went down -- one expects for good -- due to US unhappiness over its activities. Those included running its own digital currency, also called the Liberty Reserve, and offering money transfer services to anyone with an email address.  As for who most enjoyed those services, John Law notes that the editor of one online news service of his acquaintance told him that the story caused a spike of many thousands of new readers -- half of whom appeared to be connecting from Lagos.  The mainstream media spotted the story too, and the BBC devoted some time to asking the question, “What is a digital currency, anyway?” Everyone’s favorite cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, got dragged in but, to its credit, Aunty pointed out that there are a lot of digital currencies and many of them look quite weird.  Every multiplayer online trading game has something you can win through battle or trade, and trade away for in-game goods or services. Mobile phone minutes can be exchanged for money -- of course -- but are also used in other trades, much as postage stamps used to be a fairly common way of settling small debts. Air miles and Nectar points both have aspects of digital currency.  All you need to do to make your own digital currency is make it safe from counterfeit and make it tradeable for something that people need or want. Bitcoin is just built to be able to do that without a central control, which makes it unique, but it’s no more a digital currency for that.  The lesson, which can’t bear repeating enough, is don’t worry about the coinage, worry about the banks. And if you use one that’s unlicensed -- like a gun, taxi or pub, don’t be surprised if you get burned, robbed or end up with bad liquidity. Looked at in this light, the question of why Mt.Gox is running for legitimacy isn’t whether they’re being forced to do it, but why has it taken them so long?  It’s a matter of who you’re more afraid of, the government or the ungoverned. If you’re not sure about that, I can recommend some very adept consultants in that sort of risk management. Hold on, I’ll just get their numbers -- now what were they, +234 1 something ...  Secrets and pies  After he writes his column on a Friday morning, John Law likes to pop down to the Black Hat And Banker for a light lunch and some strong crypto with his old mate, Satoshi Nakamoto. Last Friday, Saito was in excellent mode.  “Look at this!” he said, handing over a printout. “It’s a Chartgirl infographic, bringing together various guesses about yours truly.”  It was an excellent chart, even if it focused a bit too much on amiable Net greybeard Ted Nelson.  “Oh, Ted! Well, he needed to get his profile up a bit, so I suggested he do a YouTube video. Plus, I knew it would annoy Mochizuki.”  Saito giggled, and his wig slipped a bit. It had clearly been a good lunch already.  “Now, now, John. It’s not as if I need to do any work this afternoon. This guy says I’m worth a milion BTC.”  He adjusted his dress -- summer colours do suit him -- and peered at me cheerily though his sunglasses. “So calm down and let me buy you lunch. Pork pie?”  As he staggered off to the bar in a cloud of paradox, this particular piece of the jigsaw niggled. As the inventor of Bitcoin and its first miner, the man has around a hundred million dollars to his name. But he can’t spend it without breaking cover: doesn’t matter how anonymous the technology is, if you start making major moves in it, you’ll leave a trail. Yet what sort of person can invent staggering amounts of wealth and then not touch it?  “You know the answer to that one, John,” said Saito as he plonked down a plateful of coronary in front of me. “Academic? Mathematician? Spy? Government? All fit, of course. But you and Ted and Mick and David and Gaga ... you know.”  Yes. It’s obvious, really. Who can hide in plain sight and not care about money?  “Glad you’re free this summer. I’ll see you’re in the VIP enclosure,” said Saito, sipping his pina colada. “Looking forward to playing the new stuff on the main stage. Do you think the weather will get any better?” He looked sadly out of the window at the London sky. “No, me neither. Wellies it is. See you at Glasto ...”  Bitcoin’s got talent  Back in his school days, when grown men deliberately gave him access to powerful chemicals and taught him how to make booze, explosives and poison, John Law had a fondness for test tubes and Bunsen burners. One of the little bits of (mercifully, now useless) information he retains from those days is that of litmus paper, those little gaily colored strips that told you whether something was acidic or alkali.  Bitcoin, it turns out, has a similarly useful trick. For while you might think you’re reading the news to learn about Bitcoin, you can just as easily use Bitcoin to learn about the news -- in particular, about how biased a news outlet or a writer actually is.  This is because Bitcoin is in a unique position. It’s been around for just long enough that a few facts are well established, but not for so long that it’s become part of the establishment. It has lots of implications to choose from, from the End Of The World to Eternal Paradise, but there’s no consensus about which is true. It’s simple enough that an intelligent reader with an interest -- that’s you -- can quickly learn the facts and get a sense of the implications. In other words, if you know and care enough about Bitcoin to be reading this, you probably know as much as 99 percent of the journalists writing about the subject.  And so, if a printed, online or broadcast news outlet has a bias, you can spot it (you may share that bias -- but that’s up to you). So, here’s a quick guide to the Bitcoin Test for News. If you see more of these than normal, here’s what you can tell.  What They Say:  Bitcoin is under attack/being closed down/the tool of evil, especially when the main story isn’t Bitcoin, such as Liberty Research.  What They Mean:  Our readers aren’t very smart and are easy to scare. Our owners are bankers. Trust us. Fear everyone else. EVERYONE.  What They Say:  Bitcoin is the magic fairy dust that will make you rich and send The Government wild.  What They Mean:  Our readers aren’t very smart but boy are they greedy. We get our money from people who want to sell you stuff that you want to be believe in. Trust us. Sneer at everyone else.  What They Say:  Bitcoin is interesting but don’t blow your stack on it. Nobody knows how this is going to pan out.  What They Mean:  We actually think our readers are cool and careful. Our owners are nervous. Make your own mind up whether you trust us or not -- oh, and if you could think about our jolly nice advertisers, we’d be ever so grateful.  What They Say:  Gorgeous pouting Samantha is just CHAMPING at the BIT for cryptocurrency!  What They Mean:  If the tabloids are writing about Bitcoin, then it’s too late. You might as well be buying Premium Bonds. Time to move on.  John Law  is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

42424918,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX2Lh,1370005946,Alpacas: the unofficial mascot of bitcoin?,"What’s up with alpacas and Bitcoin? Well, if a digital currency movement can be said to have a mascot, alpacas serve that role for Bitcoin, albeit unofficially.  In fact, a Bitcoin Forum discussion in April 2011 offered a “bounty for a bitcoin mascott (sic) drawing” and offered a photo of an alpaca to serve as a model. The individual who made the offer was not pleased with any of the drawings, and so there is no official mascot rendering for Bitcoin at present.  The Bitcoin wiki page on alpacas traces the connection to a Feb. 10, 2011 Slashdot post about what people could buy with bitcoins at that time. Alpaca wool socks from Grass Hill Alpaca were among the first products available for Bitcoiners to purchase. Other mentions of alpaca socks, like Slashdot’s “Do alpacas really wear socks?” kept the animal reference going.  Obviously, the alpaca socks are made of alpaca wool and not for alpacas. If you haven’t seen an alpaca, it looks rather like a llama, though it is smaller. The official name of this camelid is Vicugna pacos.It has a long history of domestication, as people use its wool, which is softer and warmer than that of sheep. The absence of lanolin means the fibers are hypoallergenic. That’s a major selling point for socks made of alpaca rather than sheep’s wool.  Alpaca socks keep cropping up in lists of what people can buy with bitcoins in various articles and videos. Back in March 2011, WeUseCoins.com posted the short, animated “What is Bitcoin?” video on YouTube. It even inspired a song titled “Alpaca Socks,” aka “The Bitcoin Song.”  Most recently, alpaca socks were featured in the “Bitcoin Kid” interview of Stefan Thomas of Ripple during the May 2013 Bitcoin conference in San Jose, CA. You can view the video here.  According to the Bitcoin wiki page, the Bitcoin community has latched onto the alpaca-Bitcoin connection. After Bernard Von NotHaus was labeled a “domestic terrorist” for issuing his own currency, Bitcoiners embraced the slogan, “We are ‘alpaca-sock-wearing crypto-terrorists,’ ” which gave the alpaca socks pride of place in the image.  So how did this less-than-obvious pairing begin? The Grass Hill Alpacas farm in Haydenville, Massachusetts is owned by Jim and Nancy Forster. It was their son, David Forster, who convinced them to accept bitcoins. Forster, who calls himself a “self-taught economist,” claims the distinction of being the first merchant to sell a product for bitcoins. When he learned about Bitcoin in 2011, he resolved to find a way to participate in that economy without mining. “I wanted to get involved, but didn’t trust anyone enough to send an envelope of cash to get a bitcoin, so I decided to sell socks in exchange for bitcoins,” says Forster.  It works like this: David buys the socks from his parents for dollars and then sells them through the website for bitcoins. The strategy has proven very good for business, as this June 2011 “SmartMoney” article noted:  Sock sales have risen to between 75 and 100 since the experiment began from four dozen during all of last year and orders have come from as far as Finland and Russia. More remarkable is what has happened to pricing. Forster began charging 75 Bitcoins for each pair in February and has since had to lower the price to 5 due to extreme appreciation in the currency’s value.  Of course, at today’s valuation, the price would have to be only a fraction of a bitcoin as the socks are priced at $20 a pair.  Forster says the digital currency facilitates sales overseas.  “It makes international transactions as easy as interacting with your neighbor, so we’ve sold socks to dozens of countries in Europe,” he says.  Of course, avoiding the currency exchange and foreign transaction fees is another benefit for both the customer and seller over international borders. Even for domestic sales, Forster points out, transactions using bitcoins prove far more cost-effective than those using credit cards or PayPal because the fees are so much lower.  Forster’s only regret is that he did not hold onto all the bitcoins he obtained from the sock sales. Much to his chagrin, he traded them in for cash and web services. From now on, though, perhaps he will not be so hasty.  And, yes, you can still buy these socks for bitcoins at Grass Hill Alpacas. Then you too can be properly clad when declaring yourself an “alpaca-sock-wearing crypto-terrorist.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Ariella Brown,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/31/alpacas-the-unofficial-mascot-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fe89d26c58c9b3e3715f460bb4a712a5cf896b9-640x425.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424912,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX27h,1369997556,Zen - Bitcoin's polar opposite,"The freewheeling Bitcoin that operates without central authority, isn't pegged to any currency or commodity, and is subject to wild fluctuations in value has a polar opposite in the digital currency world: Zen.  Sort of the anti-Bitcoin, Zen touts itself as the stable digital currency, tied to the performance of 22 international currencies. The money supply, which is managed by a democratic organization, can be regulated to curb inflation and deflation.  History  Zen is a product of Zurker, a crowdfunded social platform. A competitor to Facebook, Zurker distinguishes itself with a co-op label, meaning its users are also the owners of the social platform. The top search results for Zurker, which launched last year to much skepticism, question whether this social network is a actually a scam. In April, Zurker launched Zen, making it one of the newest arrivals in the digital currency world. For now, Zen can only be spent on Zurker to buy vShares, or a stake in the company.  A basket of 22 currencies  Self-described as ""an unbiased elegant solution which nonetheless reflects market conditions,"" Zen is pegged to a basket of 22 international currencies. This setup means the currency is stable (hence the name) — compared not just to the notoriously volatile Bitcoin, but to other individual currencies, such as the US dollar. The 22 freely floating currencies include the US dollar, euro and Philippine peso (see full list here).  Instant confirmation  While Bitcoin transactions can take upwards of 10 minutes to confirm, Zen transfers can be validated in seconds because there's no need to check against double-spending.  Centralized and decentralized  Zen has both elements of centralization and decentralization. The currency is overseen by a ""transparent democratically managed organization with open-book accounting,"" which is empowered to regulate the money supply to prevent inflation or deflation. Anybody is free to join and become a member of this organization.  Systematically, Zen is designed to be centralized. Wallets can be stored by third-party apps. Agents can act as banks, holding accounts on behalf of users. Holders of the currency can also create their own private bank-like accounts. With the Zen API, users can also create wallets, issue and verify vouchers, transfer Zen and check exchange rates.  Environmentally friendly  Unlike mining for Bitcoin, which is so resource-intensive that it can cost upwards of $150,000 in energy costs each day, Zen is issued in exchange for legal tender. To get hold of this currency, people can purchase it from authorized agents, from other Zen holders or by referring friends to Zurker. While Bloomberg calls the Bitcoin mining process a ""real-world environmental disaster,"" Zen describes itself as possibly the greenest currency, since it doesn't require paper, metals or extreme processing power.  More to come  A lot of details surrounding Zen are still being sorted out. The body that manages Zen is in the process of drafting a constitution and developing the mechanisms that govern the currency. To encourage people to keep their money in this alternative currency, there are also plans for Zen banks to offer high interest rates. While Zen can only be spent on Zurker at the moment, a Zen marketplace encompassing a wide range of goods and services is in the works.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING,Alice Truong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/31/zen-bitcoins-polar-opposite,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ed3fcee32f5565e39c3bacb16dbe453283c1d42a-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, told the American Banker that the US had no ideological beef with alternative currencies, but expects them to follow existing anti-money laundering rules.  Calvery said: ""Digital currencies are just a financial service and those who deal in them are a financial institution. Any financial institution and any financial service could potentially pose an AML[anti-money laundering] threat.""  She said action against Liberty Reserve was simply one criminal case against one suspected law breaker and had no bearing on the industry as a whole.  Asked if FinCEN considered putting its recent guidance out for comment Calvery said they did not because it is just an interpretation of existing rules.  She said she welcomed innovation in financial services but those involved needed to act with transparency and integrity.  Calvery said: ""I think innovation in financial services industry holds out great promise on so many levels for commerce and for social reasons like providing services to the unbanked. But like any financial services, it comes with an obligation and those obligations to protect the U.S. financial system from money laundering need to be taken seriously.""  Apparently without irony Calvery said: ""I actually heard the CEO of a bank say recently that there is a reason that financial institutions have to obtain licenses and to register. And that's because it is a great bestowal of trust to the bankers, to the financial service providers, to be able to be part of the U.S. financial system, to be able to be part of the global financial system. And that trust and that privilege come with obligations.""  Calvery joined FinCEN last September from the Department of Justice.

42424917,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX2Hh,1369978808,VC: Bitcoin is schmuck insurance,"Chamath Palihapitiya  , founder of The Social+Capital Partnership, a co-owner of the Golden State Warriors NBA team and a former Facebook exec, sees Bitcoin as ""schmuck insurance.""  To Palihapitiya, schmucks are the Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, AIGs, London Whales and other scandal-ridden ""masters"" of the financial services universe that have -- since the near-meltdown of the global economy in 2008 -- had an almost alchemical ability to turn gold into dross.  Palihapitiya's embrace of a better alternative in his Bloomberg commentary ""Why I Invested in Bitcoin"" clearly echoes the frustrations of many Bitcoiners with the dysfunctions of today's financial system. It's hard not to become cynical when the HSBCs of the world openly welcome massive cash deposits from Mexican drug cartels for years ... and somehow manage to still stay in business.  Meanwhile, people who aren't financial masters of the universe don't enjoy such free passes. In fact, when the big money boys misbehave, it's the little guys who end up taking the brunt of the punishment (see Cyprus, Portugal, etc.)  Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a way to view financial transactions in a whole new light, Palihapitiya writes. He compares it to the ""red pill"" offered to the character Neo in the movie ""The Matrix"" ... a pill that basically makes the scales fall from your eyes about how things really work.  ""I’ve told my friends that it is entirely rational to allocate one percent of your assets to Bitcoin -- as I have,"" Palihapitiya writes. ""Call it schmuck insurance.

42424924,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX2Th,1369965794,Trust in Bitcoin builds by solving one 'puzzle' at a time,"What makes Bitcoin transactions secure and trustworthy? Computer security and cryptography expert Zulfikar Ramzan explains the workings of the transaction blockchain in this video, one of a series that are featured on the online learning site Khan Academy.  Understanding the transaction blockchain, Ramzan says, helps to illustrate ""how somebody might try to game or defraud the system and why that's not only mathematically hard to do but why there's actually an incentive -- actually an economic incentive in the Bitcoin system -- for different people to behave honestly.""  That incentive comes through the process of mining, which involves solving a so-called ""proof-of-work"" puzzle. Whoever solves the puzzle first ""mines"" a new batch of bitcoins. While a single miner trying to solve a proof-of-work puzzle could spend a year or two looking for the answer, the network of miners is so large that someone, somewhere finds a solution, on average, every 10 minutes. Over time, the chain of puzzles and solutions becomes so long -- and so many people have contributed their work and computing power to it -- that it becomes increasingly unlikely to be tampered with.  ""The more work that went into the overall chain, the more trust they'll have in that transaction,"" Ramzan notes. ""There are no known shortcuts for solving these puzzles ...
