42428909,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLl5Jh,1524517817,Coinbase-Cryptsy Lawsuit Will Head to Jury Trial,"Coinbase has lost another appeal in a lawsuit brought by former customers of the defunct cryptocurrency exchange Cryptsy, and the case will now proceed to a jury trial.  An appeals court in Georgia on Monday affirmed a lower court's denial of Coinbase's appeal of the case, which blames the company for failing to stop Cryptsy's chief executive from allegedly absconding with his customers' money.  In the case, plaintiff Brandon Leidel, who was a Cryptsy customer, claims that Coinbase should have actively helped prevent Cryptsy CEO Paul Vernon from laundering the funds through a Coinbase wallet.  Vernon allegedly used Coinbase to launder millions of dollars he is accused of stealing from his customers prior to Cryptsy's collapse, as previously reported.  Coinbase tried to negotiate the case in arbitration by pointing at user agreements Vernon signed when he first began using the wallet. However, a judge ruled last year that Cryptsy's customers are not bound by the same agreements that Vernon was, and therefore are not required to arbitrate the case.  Coinbase appealed this decision, but the appeal was denied by a district court.  The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision Monday, writing that ""Leidel does not seek to enforce the terms of the User Agreements, nor does he allege any tort rooted in an allegation that Defendant breached or facilitated a breach of any obligation uniquely imposed by those agreements."" The decision went on to say:  ""In other words, Leidel's claims are viable, if at all, without reference to the User Agreements, as the duties Defendant allegedly breached were not imposed by those agreements.""  As a result, the court has opened the door for a jury trial in the class action lawsuit, which can now proceed to discovery.  In a statement, David Silver, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said ""we are pleased, though not surprised, the¬†appellate court affirmed the trial court‚Äôs decision to keep this dispute in the public view ... We look forward to having Coinbase answer for its role in the millions of dollars in harm suffered by our clients; and we look forward to resolving these claims in court.""

According to a Form D published on April 20, Orchid has raised roughly $36.1 million out of a planned $125.59 million. Per the Form D filing, 42 investors have taken part in the sale of SAFTs ‚Äì or Simple Agreements for Future Tokens ‚Äì thus far. The SAFT gives accredited investors the right to claim blockchain tokens at a later date, and the investors involved must meet certain SEC-mandated income or asset thresholds in order to participate.  The startup is seeking to build an alternative to Tor, the anonymous browser software ‚Äì Orchid's white paper argues that Tor can¬†be compromised due to a lack of network nodes. It also aims to provide an alternative to virtual private networks (VPN), which require users to trust the provider.  Orchid's solution allows bandwidth users and providers to exchange ethereum-based Orchid tokens, which the firm hopes will incentivize greater participation than the Tor network has enjoyed. By executing these micropayments through the ethereum blockchain, Orchid has designed its network to be decentralized, in contrast to VPNs.  The firm raised $4.7 million in October from a raft of top-tier venture capital firms, including Andreessen Horowitz, Blockchain Capital, Polychain Capital and Sequoia.  Orchid's co-founder and CEO Steven Waterhouse told CoinDesk at the time:  ""This is about anti-surveillance and anti-censorship, the ability to not be tracked.

The former JPMorgan blockchain lead made the comments during a talk on the ""Internet of Value"" and delivered to MIT Technology Review's Business of Blockchain conference.  ""The maximalism that we have to do everything in a decentralized way is a bit of a fallacy,"" she said, going on to explain:  ""If you want private, secure communications, [you should] almost never use a blockchain. You want something that is ephemeral, not immutable.""  Baldet  instead suggested that hybrid disclosing networks could offer a better solution. Likewise, she claimed that the blockchain is not a privacy solution, but rather ""fundamentally an information security product.""  Her speech highlighted the wide variety of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies and emphasized that there is no single correct approach among the various versions. She also commented that ""given the trade-off between privacy and convenience, people have always chosen convenience.""  Baldet, who oversaw the development of JPMorgan's permissioned blockchain, Quorum, left¬†the Wall Street bank earlier this month to start her own venture. She has not yet revealed any further details on her plans.

42428924,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLl5hh,1524495600,Overbought? Bitcoin Cash Looks Extended After 80% Gain,"The world's fourth largest cryptocurrency looks overbought and due for a pullback.  After confirming a bull breakout on April 15 (by crossing the long-term descending trendline), bitcoin cash (BCH) ultimately rallied more than 80 percent in the last week. (The price rise occurred alongside the broader market recovery seen after bitcoin's¬†$1,000 rally on April 12.)  As a result, bitcoin cash has outperformed its peers over the last seven days, rising well above the $1,000 mark.  Stepping back, the news of a coming technical upgrade (via a process known as a¬†hard fork) seems to have played a big role in boosting BCH prices. The bitcoin cash network is scheduled to change the cryptocurrency's underlying code, increasing its block size from 8MB to 32MB, on May 15.  However, there is no plan to ""airdrop"" a new coin to current holders, and the current blockchain will merely be replaced by the updated version (Bitcoin ABC 0.17.0) if it gains sufficient support.  So, while BCH investors will not be making free money out of thin air, prices have still rallied sharply, possibly because investors tend to associate hard forks with ""free money."" And once the investors realize the hard fork is only a software upgrade, the rally may well run out of steam.  Backing up that argument, the technical charts show the rally is overdone and a pullback could be on the cards.  As of writing, BCH is changing hands at $1,413 on Bitfinex ‚Äì up 15 percent in the last 24 hours.  Daily chart  The overall bias remains bullish as suggested by the upside break of the long-term descending trendline on April 15 and the ascending (bullish biased) 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs).¬†Daily trading volume has also jumped 374 percent week-on-week, signaling a strong rally.  However, the relative strength index (RSI) stands well above 80.00, signaling short-term overbought conditions.  View  A pullback¬†to the 100-day MA support of $1,167 cannot be ruled out, although dips will likely be short-lived.  On the higher side, resistance is lined up at $1,480 (Jan. 23 low), $1,630 (Feb. 18 high), $1,788 (Jan. 28 high) and $1,938.7 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement).  Only a daily close below the 10-day MA ($978) would abort the overall bullish view.  Support is seen at $1,167 (100-day MA), $1,100 (Nov. 29 low), $1,000 (psychological support), $978 (10-day MA).

At the event, Euivin Park, the firm's chief technology officer,¬†said she aims to take Line's existing blockchain efforts a big step forward by launching a blockchain mainnet.

The announcement comes just days after the company¬†launched a blockchain subsidiary, called Unblock, based in South Korea.

42428916,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLl5Rh,1524484817,Locked Out of Coinbase: Why Are Wyoming's Bitcoin Users Still Waiting?,"For over two years, Coinbase users in Wyoming have been unable access their cryptocurrency.  ""I'd venture to guess I lost $100,000 to this bullshit law,"" one resident complained on Reddit.  It was out of the blue, too, when in June 2015 the U.S.-based exchange suddenly suspended services for Wyoming residents. This was after state regulators clarified that Coinbase, in fact, fell under its Money Transmitter Act, and as such, needed to hold fiat currency reserves for all digital assets held on consumer's behalf.  Finding the requirements too challenging and costly to comply with, Coinbase pulled out of the state. And a handful of users that were residents lost access to their accounts before they were able to move their cryptocurrency off the platform.  It's been a bumpy road for those customers, one that seemed to smooth out in March of this year, when a package of blockchain business-friendly bills was passed, one of which¬†exempted cryptocurrency exchanges from the fiat reserve requirement.  Yet a month later, Coinbase has yet to restore services in the state and reunite Wyoming residents with their crypto.  ‚ÄúPeople couldn‚Äôt get hold of customer service,‚Äù Caitlin Long, the co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, which pushed for the legislative package, told CoinDesk.  And while Coinbase is one of the most law-abiding and highly respected exchanges in the industry, this isn't much of a surprise.  The exchange's image has suffered greatly over the past couple years as its customer support buckled under the pressure of mass adoption. From lackluster uptimes to¬†disabling the accounts of customers on vacation, Coinbase has struggled to keep its reputation clean from its user's standpoint ‚Äì even after its $100 million raise in August.  And in Wyoming, former users of the exchange are driving hours to attend the coalition's meetings to share their Coinbase horror stories.  While Coinbase hasn't given the word of when it might reopen services to Wyoming residents, the state banking commissioner, Albert Forkner told CoinDesk that Coinbase representatives have expressed excitement about the prospect of returning to the Cowboy State.  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be looking into the business plan to get accounts reopened in Wyoming,‚Äù Forkner said. ‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt take too long.‚Äù  But some of the locals are getting restless.  ‚ÄúIf a company is going to be a custodian of customers‚Äô assets, then it has an obligation to communicate with those customers,‚Äù Long said, adding:  ‚ÄúNow there is no excuse, and it comes down to whether Coinbase wants to do right by its customers or not.‚Äù  Coinbase did not respond to request for comment on the matter.  State-by-state issues  And while Coinbase acknowledges these unpleasant experiences ‚Äì even¬†hiring executives to focus on improving customer service ‚Äì regulation has thrust it into similar situations in other states.  For one, some users who don't even live in Wyoming anymore, but still have a Wyoming driver's license, have also had their accounts suspended.  Plus, Coinbase users in¬†Hawaii and Minnesota have also been cut off from their accounts, thanks to similar state regulations.  One Reddit user in Minnesota lamented Coinbase's new identity verification process, which it launched in 2017 after the user had been a customer of the exchange for two years, saying:  ‚ÄúAll of this would be fine if it was a prerequisite for use, but springing it on me now feels like they are holding my money hostage.‚Äù  The Minnesotan went on, saying it took nine days from him to get an automated reply from customer support, which merely said Coinbase was flooded with support requests and couldn‚Äôt answer them all.  Even after the verification appeared to go through, he still had trouble transferring funds.  Controlling private keys  For Long, these situations highlight the importance of users holding their own private keys.  For the uninitiated, a private key is like a very long password that can't be reset or recovered. The ""key"" is usually 64 randomly generated letters and numbers, sometimes in the form of assorted words arranged in a particular order.  These private keys are needed to complete any bitcoin transaction. Unlike most personal wallet platforms, which store private keys on the user's phone (like Mycelium) or browser (Blockchain.com), Coinbase holds these keys on users' behalf.  It's more convenient, definitely, since all users need to access their money is their Coinbase login, which if lost or forgotten can be reset like a normal password. But the trade-off is that users give up control of their funds, and as a consequence can be at the whims of the party that does control the key ‚Äì as the Wyoming incident displays.  With that, Long likens Coinbase to a bank.  Whereas many see bitcoin as an alternative to the traditional financial industry, using third-party services like Coinbase's feels merely like the same service with a different name.  Long concluded:  ‚ÄúIf you are going to keep your bitcoin in a third-party custodian that has control of your bitcoin, you haven‚Äôt really improved your situation. I think most Coinbase users don‚Äôt understand that.‚Äù  Locked door image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/23/locked-out-of-coinbase-why-are-wyomings-bitcoin-users-still-waiting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/545c9fe37e76e0cbf50bc73cd17f15d545eca435-1500x999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency crossed the long-term descending trendline (drawn from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high) in a convincing manner and closed well above the resistance at $8,459 on Friday, signaling a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  However, in the last 48 hours, BTC has struggled to hold on to gains above $9,000 over the weekend, indicating bullish exhaustion around the key resistance.  As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $8,940 on Bitfinex ‚Äì up almost 40 percent from the April. 1 low of $6,425.  Daily chart  The chart above shows that BTC created a small doji candle on Saturday, marking indecision in the marketplace. When viewed against the backdrop of a 40 percent rally from $6,425, the doji likely signals bullish exhaustion.  Further, BTC reported losses on Sunday, confirming a bearish doji reversal pattern.  The cryptocurrency is showing signs of exhaustion near a strong resistance zone of $9,177‚Äì$9,280, indicated by the following factors:  $9,177: March 21 high.  $9,278: 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from the Dec. 17 high to Feb. 6 low.  $9,285: 100-day moving average (MA).  $9,280: Feb. 25 low.  The short-duration chart below also shows overbought conditions and scope for a pullback.  4-hour chart  The relative strength index has turned lower from the overbought territory (above 80.00) and is creating lower highs, despite BTC's price remaining steady around $8,900. The bearish divergence adds credence to signs the signs of bullish exhaustion seen in the daily chart.  However, any pullback will likely be short-lived, as the major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) are trending north in favor of the bulls.  View  Signs of bullish exhaustion near the key resistance zone indicate scope for a minor pullback, possibly to the ascending 10-day MA located at $8,423.  Longer term, BTC looks set to test the 200-day MA lined up at $9,784 and could possibly test the $10,000 mark.

Scheduled to start in June this year and endorsed by Japan's Ministry of the Environment, the project will be supervised by energy trading startup Power Sharing¬†with technological support provided by energy corporations such as Tokyo Electric Power Co. and financial giant Softbank, according to a statement released Monday.  Softbank said it will lend its capacity in authenticating critical information about renewable energy trading, such as ""who, what, when, where, how much."" That data and the energy trades will then be recorded and transacted over the blockchain platform jointly developed by the partners.  The hope, according to the statement, is to use this customer-to-customer mechanism to incentivize residents in rural Japan to switch to renewable energy, of which they can sell any excess capacity, as part of Japan's effort¬†to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  While traditional centralized systems can also provide a platform for renewable energy trading, the partners explained that they become extremely complex if¬†used across general consumers.

Tezos, the blockchain project backed by the largest ever initial coin offering (ICO) at the time of its 2017 launch, hasn't exactly been able to translate its hype into success as yet. Hamstrung by series of legal woes, the open-source software, designed for blockchain governance, has spent months ironically held back by real-world challenges similar in spirit to those it was designed to overcome digitally.  But after a whirlwind transition at the non-profit that oversees the software,¬†the protocols creators and investors are moving swiftly toward a beta and a formal release. Outstanding issues remain, mostly of a legal and bureaucratic nature, but those involved say the technology is taking strides toward going live.  ‚ÄúNice to be back to business,"" venture capitalist Timothy Draper, a financial backer of the Tezos protocol, told CoinDesk in an email.  Draper is, of course, discussing that transition, during which grassroots investors became activists and completely took over governance of the Swiss foundation that controls the funds raised in its 2017 token sale.  To recap, the story begins when Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS) proposed a totally new blockchain called Tezos that would use proof-of-stake to confirm blocks and could amend itself over time, as technology changed.  In July, it raised $232 million¬†in the largest ever ICO up to that point. The funds were controlled by the Tezos Foundation, which soon proved unwilling to spend the funds on developing the protocol.  In October, this tension spilled out in public view when Reuters reported that the creators of the protocol, Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, had called for the ousting of the foundation's chair, Johann Gevers.  Then, at the beginning of February, a group of activist Tezos investors set up an alternate legal entity called T2¬†in case DLS decided to launch the protocol under a different legal entity. By the end of the month, Gevers had stepped down and members of the T2 board were moving onto the foundation's board.  ""Through the adversity, we've grown and we've strengthened,"" Ryan Jesperson, the new president of the Tezos Foundation board, told CoinDesk in his first interview taking a seat on the board.  The first two board members to join were Inria's Michel Mauny and Jesperson, who initially founded T2.  Kathleen Breitman, one of the two original creators of Tezos, told CoinDesk in an interview:  ""If we're going to talk about silver linings of the past few months there's been a bunch of people who've just stepped up and kind of been drawn ‚Äì by their passion moreso than anything else ‚Äì to self-organize.""  One intense month  But if all of this sounds fast, that's because it has been.  In a phone interview with CoinDesk from Switzerland, Jesperson described himself as a normal rank-and-file investor, one who ""came to be concerned"" about the protocol's future.  Still, no one could have anticipated the impact Jesperson's next moves would have.  Cornell's Prof. Emin Gun Sirer, an advisor to Tezos, told CoinDesk bluntly:  ""I don't think anyone expected the dramatic situation to be resolved this quickly.""  Indeed, at the time, Jesperson talked about T2 more as a backup plan.  ""Really, the purpose of the T2 Foundation was to find a safe and timely place for the whole network to launch,"" Jesperson said. ""Over time it became apparent that there became another solution.""  That solution was letting T2 board members take over the Tezos Foundation as former members stepped down. He described it as a voluntary move on the part of Gevers and fellow board member, Lars Haussmann, who had only joined the board at the end of January.  The new board chair declined to detail what gave his team the leverage to assert control over the organization controlling the pre-sale of Tezos tokens (or ""tezzies""), saying that he ""generally wants to be forward focusing as much as possible and not rehash the past.""  Jesperson did say that, since taking over, he's only become more sold on the technology. While declining to go into detail about the financial wellness of the institution, he did confirm there were ""no surprises."" Funds are flowing to developers now and other initiatives to build the ecosystem will move forward soon.  Breitman said, ""Once the token is launched I think it will be easier to have a conversation about what happened and what sort of lessons we learned.""  Former board chair Johann Gevers did not reply to a request for comment.  Coming soon  With the new leadership in place,¬†Tezos has been running hard toward a release.  Jesperson had to quickly relocate himself and his family from the U.S. to Switzerland, rotating through temporary housing as they sought a permanent spot. Meanwhile, he's been working long days setting up the necessary operational structure so that a launched protocol can thrive.  In the last week the foundation finished incorporating Tezos AG, an operational entity ""that will provide basic administration and general management functions,"" he said. Jesperson will have a role at both Tezos AG and the foundation.  They are also working to set up Tezos France, which will be an organizational home for the existing team of developers that have been building the protocol.  ""Then of course at the same time we support any other organizations that want to be involved and support Tezos. There's all sorts of grassroots people getting involved in their own way,"" Jersperson said.  The T2 Foundation, he said, is not needed any longer. Its purpose was to give Tezos a safe legal entity to launch under if needed, but that's no longer necessary.  Sirer said, ""We're all very excited and focused on the great technology to come from a well-funded effort built around a strong vision.""  In its most recent updatehttps://tezosfoundation.ch/news/preparing-launch-tezos-network/, the foundation projected a Q3 public launch following a Q2 beta release. An alpha has been running for the last year, but Jesperson noted that real-world conditions are needed to really see how the technology performs.  The software is going through two technical reviews now. One by Inria, a French technical institution focused on computer science. Tezos was built in the programming language OCaml, which was created at Inria. The other is a security review by Least Authority, a company originally founded by Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, who currently runs zcash.  With development moving forward, the Breitmans have been free to focus on their Tezos-related interests rather than Tezos itself.  ""Arthur and I never wanted this to be the Kathleen and Arthur show. We think there's a lot of wisdom in the crowd. And what's nice about Tezos is that it's so agnostic that anyone can propose an upgrade to the protocol,"" Breitman said.  Dynamic Ledger Solutions is looking forward to building products that can work on top of Tezos.  ""I remain excited about the great opportunities Tezos provides, and look forward to getting the first version shipped,‚Äù Draper said.  Fortunately for all stakeholders, the team building the protocol didn't stop their efforts during the upheavals.  ""I think what people don't realize was that during this whole time the development moved forward,"" Jesperson said, concluding:  ""From this point, we really want to be the model for how a blockchain project functions.""

42428906,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLl59h,1524463206,Travel Booking Site CheapAir Is Switching Bitcoin Payment Processors,"Online travel booking agency CheapAir.com said Friday that it will switch bitcoin payment processors following a service change by Coinbase.  CheapAir.com ‚Äì which began accepting bitcoin back in 2013 in a first for the global travel industry ‚Äì explained the move in a blog post, revealing it is eyeing a move to accept bitcoin payments through Bitpay.  ""We were recently informed by our processing partner, Coinbase, that they will no longer support 'custodial' solutions for merchants, and are removing a number of the tools and features that we rely on to accept bitcoin from CheapAir.com shoppers,"" CheapAir wrote. ""These changes are scheduled to occur in a matter of weeks.""  According to CheapAir, the process that converts the bitcoin it receives from customers to fiat currencies is key to the platform's ability to accept the cryptocurrency, since traditional airlines and hotel services only take fiat currencies as payment.  The company also said that, as part of the shift, it's looking at accepting other cryptocurrencies, naming bitcoin cash, dash and litecoin as potential options. CheapAir announced in 2014 that it was accepting litecoin and dogecoin by way of GoCoin, another cryptocurrency payment processor.  However, while CheapAir said the integration with Bitpay has already completed, it foresees the adoption may not be as smooth as previously.  ""Our one giant concern is that Bitpay does not support 'non-payment protocol wallets' (wallets that aren‚Äôt BIP-70 compliant). So if you do not have a compatible wallet, you would have to get one and use it as an intermediate stage for your Bitcoin payment,"" the company said in the statement, going on to request that users send feedback on the Bitpay option:  ""This is where we‚Äôd love your input.""

42428920,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLl5Zh,1524454257,All About Verge: The $1 Billion Cryptocurrency That's Pumping On Porn,"‚ÄúThe future has cum.‚Äù  Clad in balaclavas and carrying sacks of plastic coins redeemable for real cryptocurrency, porn stars stormed Wall Street last week with cries of ""free money."" No late-night TV parody, the scene was rather meant to mark one of the most surprising announcements in crypto so far in 2018, the news that verge (XVG) had been officially added as a payment method on adult entertainment website Pornhub.  Indeed, with an average of 81 million visitors per day, the deal with the name-brand website has been heralded as a defining moment for the industry, one that has also done much to¬†boost awareness¬†of what was until April 17 among the lesser-known of the many privacy-centric cryptocurrencies.  But the news has stirred up criticisms as well.  A relatively small crypto asset by market cap, verge‚Äôs privacy measures have been long dismissed¬†by some of the industry‚Äôs top researchers. As such, the response from the broader crypto community has been, at times, incredulous.  ‚ÄúI don't view their deal with Pornhub as any endorsement or indication of their technical value,‚Äù Sarang Noether, a researcher at rival privacy-centric cryptocurrency monero, told CoinDesk. ""It just indicates that you can make a deal with Pornhub if you pay millions of dollars.‚Äù  Of note in Noether's comments is the nature of the Pornhub arrangement, which found the cryptocurrency's users paying to incentivize the deal. In a matter of weeks, global verge users, or the ‚Äú#vergefam"" as they're sometimes known, raised 75 million XVG, or $5.2 million, in donations toward the partnership.  And the payments are continuing to flood into the verge donation address, where they will eventually be put toward a strategy that verge core developer Justin ‚ÄúSunerok‚Äù Valo described as¬†‚Äúa global marketing campaign the likes of which you have never seen.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to change crypto in a really, really good way,""¬†Valo told his fans.  But there‚Äôs a darker side to the promotion as well. Dismissed by one user as a ‚Äúcult of teenagers,‚Äù verge‚Äôs avid followers are known for being outspoken, even going to war with the notorious security developer John McAfee on Twitter in what was allegedly a paid pump gone awry.  Perversely, though, some think the coin's bad reputation might just increase its appeal.  Sarang told CoinDesk:  ‚ÄúIf anything, I think verge will use this to push some kind of ‚Äòbad boy of crypto‚Äô image. Whether or not it succeeds, people now see it as the asset that a big porn site accepts.‚Äù  Dogecoindark  Stepping back, it's worth noting that until recently, XVG was worth a fraction of a fraction of a cent.  A largely obscure cryptocurrency, it was originally created as ‚Äúdogecoindark‚Äù back in 2014 by a¬†little-known developer from Florida named Justin Valo, who has had some minor brushes with the law¬†that he's acknowledged as potentially related to recreational marijuana use.  A fork of the cryptocurrency named peercoin, dogecoindark aimed to achieve privacy by routing payments over Tor and IP2, two network anonymity protocols that conceal location data and IP addresses. Announced on the Tor mailing list, it was met by a cold reception, with a user replying that the ‚ÄúTor community is not a suitable target for cheap scams using altcoins.‚Äù  In the peak of altcoin mania, the response on Bitcoin Talk, one of the oldest and most widely used forums for online cryptocurrency discussion, was similarly dismissive.  ‚ÄúIf this coin makes it to an exchange, all hope is truly lost for crypto,‚Äù one user wrote.  Distinct from a closely woven pack of followers, dogecoindark remained largely unknown for several years. It rebranded to verge two years ago and saw brief price fluctuations as it was added to more exchanges.  According to Valo, the move corresponded with a software release that routed dogecoindark payments through IP2.  ‚ÄúThe community decided we should rebrand to be taken more seriously,‚Äù Valo told CoinDesk.  Then, in December last year, the cryptocurrency went from $0.005 to $0.25 in a matter of days.  The boost corresponded with a tweet by John McAfee, founder of anti-viral McAfee software, who wrote that alongside monero and zcash, privacy-centric cryptocurrencies like verge ‚Äúcannot lose.‚Äù  The tweet was allegedly accompanied by multiple statements by McAfee's social media accounts predicting a meteoric rise for the cryptocurrency. McAfee later said these accounts were fake, and that the verge price had been ‚Äúwrongly pumped beyond reason.‚Äù  Imperfect privacy  In technical circles, the reaction has been similar. Days after the McAfee incident, a website was published that leaked the location data of verge transactions.  The incident highlights another issue, that verge‚Äôs approach to privacy has long been a point of contention in the cryptocurrency space. Essentially, because its network routing protocol only conceals the location of its users ‚Äì and not wallets, payments or identities ‚Äì tracing analysis is easy to conduct.  ‚ÄúSo much for Verge $XVG and their IP address privacy,‚Äù Riccardo Spagni, a core developer of monero, tweeted, with a link to the data dump. ‚ÄúConsidering that IP address obfuscation is their single privacy claim, looks like they're toast,‚Äù the developer wrote.  Still, the website was dismissed by the verge community as ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and FUD, with others using the data dump as proof of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs aptitude.  ‚ÄúThose are just locations of Tor relay nodes,‚Äù Valo told CoinDesk. ""None of those are our actual users' home IP addresses.‚Äù  In a recent verge software release called the ‚Äúwraith protocol,‚Äù the cryptocurrency project added so-called stealth addresses, a way to obscure the recipient of a transaction. Upcoming releases claim to include ring signatures, or RingCT, as well as smart contract and atomic swap capability.  But many in the cryptocurrency space are dismissive of these measures.  Sarang told CoinDesk:  ‚ÄúThey make broad privacy claims that aren't supported by their history, and they're a perfect example of how the market generally can't identify good design.‚Äù  Mining attack  But the privacy leak wasn't the first attack.  Just weeks before the Pornhub partnership was announced, a hacker took over the verge blockchain, mining one block a second and printing millions of XVG.  Posted by a mining pool operator named ‚Äúocminer‚Äù on Bitcoin Talk, the attack was a mining exploit that allowed an attacker to create low difficulty blocks by manipulating timestamps.  Citing allegations of developer negligence, ocminer called verge ‚Äúan absolutely trashy shitcoin‚Äù that had been ‚Äúpumped in heaven through that tweet from John McAfee.‚Äù  Speaking to Valo, the miner continued: ‚ÄúInvest it into a decent dev team, as seriously, and everyone knows that, you have not the slightest idea of coding whatsoever.‚Äù  According to Sarang, reports and discussions of the event were silenced on the verge subreddit, alongside critical discussions of privacy.  But such controversy's have not diminished verge's fanbase.  Valo told CoinDesk:  ‚ÄúOur community never ceases to amaze me. It's really hard to wrap my head around how large it really is.‚Äù  Pact with the devil  But even the verge community is not without its doubts.  For example, prior to the Pornhub announcement, rumors were circulating¬†its developers might even seek to abscond with funds. That's because 8.6¬†million XVG was moved out of the donation wallet into the¬†Binance exchange, allegedly for Ledger hardware wallet integration, though the company has denied this.  And outside of the verge community, suspicion is even more rampant.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Leah Callon-Butler, co-founder of the sex-industry blockchain startup Intimate, said her company had been approached by Pornhub but had turned down the deal.  ‚ÄúIntimate.io made a strategic decision to ignore the proposal because we did not wish to align ourselves with a brand that is widely known for the proliferation of free porn,‚Äù Callon-Butler said.  SpankChain CEO Ameen Soleimani also tweeted his blockchain startup declined to work with Pornhub for ethical reasons. In his mind, oscillating Verge price patterns showed clear evidence of a ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù scheme.  But tribulations aside, the move has rocketed the cryptocurrency to the center of the spotlight.  ‚ÄúYou have to remember that 90 percent of the world is stupid, ‚Äú monero developer ‚Äúrehrar‚Äù wrote in a developer chat, adding: ‚ÄúIf you market to stupid, you get lots of money.

42428911,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLl5Hh,1524448844,Alleged Bitcoin Miner Thief Says Police Held Him 'Without Evidence',"The accused mastermind of Iceland's ""Big Bitcoin Heist"" says that he was free to travel when he escaped from a low-security prison and flew to Sweden last week.  Sindri Thor Stefansson has been accused of spearheading the theft of 600 bitcoin mining computers‚Äì hardware worth roughly $2 million ‚Äì during incidents between December and January. Stefansson sparked headlines last week after he left the prison on Tuesday and traveled by plane to Sweden on a flight that he reportedly shared with Iceland's prime minister.  Yet in a letter sent to Icelandic newspaper Frettabladid last week, Stefansson claimed he was held with no evidence for months prior to his escape. He further asserted that the order of detention against him expired on April 16, and that when police attempted to extend his custody by another 10 days, a judge deferred that decision for 24 hours. As a result, during the time of the escape, Stefansson claimed, he was legally free to go.  ""I simply refuse to be in prison of my own will, especially when the police threatens to arrest me without explanation,"" Stefansson was quoted as writing, adding:  ""I have been in custody for two and a half months unsuccessfully, without evidence, but only because of police suspicion. That's what I'm angry about. I have not been published a single testimony and I was threatened and threatened with longer isolation while isolation took place.""  Stefansson's whereabouts are currently unknown, though police suspect that he is in Spain, according to Frettabladid. The stolen mining machines are still missing and a $60,000 reward for information leading to their recovery remains in effect.  Stefansson said he wanted to return to Iceland, provided that officials affirm his status as a free man at the time of his escape.  ""I'm working on negotiating with the police in Iceland that I can get home without being arrested abroad,"" Stefansson wrote.  Note:¬†Statements in this article were translated from Icelandic.
