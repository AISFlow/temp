42379514,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88PI5,1497203415,"Bitcoin Price Crosses $3,000 Milestone to Set New All-Time High","The price of bitcoin topped $3,000 for the first time in history today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  After spending much of the last week seeking direction in the $2,700 to $2,900-range, the average price of bitcoin across major international exchanges edged up over this threshold finally at roughly 17:00 UTC.  The new record comes at a time when alternative digital assets are seeing robust inflows, with ethereum's ether token setting a new all-time high of more than $300 today as well.  Indeed, analysts spoke to the ongoing broadening of the cryptocurrency market as a tide that is benefitting bitcoin.  ""The inflows into 'alts' are greater than those into bitcoin. In other words, bitcoin is growing at a very nice pace, but non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies are growing even faster,"" cryptocurrency hedge fund manager Tim Enneking told CoinDesk.  Jehan Chu, managing partner at cryptocurrency fund Jen Advisors, agreed, noting that bitcoin is likely benefitting from new investor interest and the surging interest of ""cryptos like ether"".  Still, Arthur Hayes, founder of Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange BitMEX, stated that bitcoin is still the ""most talked-about cryptocurrency"", even as returns become more substantial in other areas of the market.  Hayes told CoinDesk:  ""As investors marvel at bitcoin's historical returns and the returns of altcoins, their natural first purchase is bitcoin. Bitcoin has under performed other coins this year, it is now playing catchup.""  Investor Sean Walsh largely agreed, pointing to bitcoin's growing price as a sign of its place in the market as the first stop on a road to other assets.  ""Bitcoin still seems like the dominant gateway to [alternative digital assets]. So, many first purchase bitcoin in order to then trade their bitcoin for altcoins,"" he noted.  The development coincides with signs that the cryptocurrency market is maturing to support new inflows and increasing interest.  As noted by CoinDesk research analyst Alex Sunnarborg today, the cryptocurrency exchange market has never been more globally diverse or buoyed by such an array of possible inflows.  Such tailwinds have combined in recent weeks to bring new investor attention to bitcoin, with expectations for bitcoin's growth becoming more and more exuberant. Danish investment firm Saxo Bank went so far as to publish a forecasting report in which it placed the possible value of bitcoin at $100,000 in the next 10 years.

42379523,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88PS9,1497177942,3 Signs the Cryptocurrency Exchange Market Is Maturing,"This article highlights findings from CoinDesk Research's new Q1 2017 State of Blockchain report, and expands on the composition of bitcoin, ethereum and other exchange trading volume into Q2.    Click here to download the slides as a PDF.    Underlying bitcoin and ether's all-time-high price rallies in Q1 was a dramatically shifting global exchange market.  So far in 2017, trading volumes have seen big changes, ones that indicate a reshaping of the global market.  Global exchange volume for bitcoin, for example, plummeted in January after the People's Bank of China (PBoC) issued guidance to domestic exchanges around their regulatory and operational policies. The development led to periods where withdrawals and margin trading were stalled, and trading fees were instituted after years of no-fee trading.  Despite the substantial shifts, here are three trends that CoinDesk Research has highlighted as signs of a maturing overall market in Q1 and the period since.  1. The decline in Chinese volume lead to more distributed global trading  The PBoC’s impact on the Chinese 'Big 3' exchanges in January sent worldwide trading volume figures tumbling to levels lower than seen in years.  The drop in CNY volume however made room for USD and JPY markets to develop as major constituents of global trading in Q1.  Since the end of the first quarter, the Japanese yen (JPY) has continued as the leading fiat currency traded for bitcoin (following legislation recognizing bitcoin as a legal payment method), with USD trailing narrowly.  Chinese yuan (CNY) volume has dropped to about a quarter to a third of that of JPY and USD, and South Korean won (KRW) and euros (EUR) are now not far behind, comprising one of the most diverse allocations of global trading the industry has ever seen.  Markets for ether followed a different trend as prices and volume both spiked at the end of Q1.  Trading throughout the quarter was dominated by BTC, with USD steadily gaining traction.  Regarding exchange trading volume, Poloniex led BTC volumes by a large margin, while Coinbase narrowly edged out Bitfinex for dominance over USD-based markets in the first quarter.  Since then, exchange dominance has remained relatively consistent, but currency rankings have shifted as KRW-based trading rallied into the third place position.  The global composition of ether trading is similarly now the most diverse it has ever been.  Ethereum  now serves as the base protocol or infrastructure layer for many decentralized applications as well as acting as a cryptocurrency (now with a combined market cap of several billion dollars alone), further positioning itself as a major backbone of future projects and trading.  The aggregate market cap of all blockchain tokens now exceeds $100m (or more depending on how you evaluate supply), currently dominated by bitcoin, ether and ripple.  Over 130 tokens now have an implied valuation of north of $10m, comprised of new blockchains like zcash, monero or litecoin and tokens created on top of existing blockchains (like ethereum or waves) such as golem, augur or gnosis. Just four years ago, only two tokens had a market cap over $10m, bitcoin and litecoin.  In the last month, 18 tokens averaged over $10m in daily trading volume.  As alternative blockchains and assets have grown in popularity, many large exchanges have extended trading support to profit from the trend – fueling their rise in trading and quoted valuations.  Leading global digital asset exchanges such as Coinbase, Poloniex, Kraken, Bittrex, Shapeshift and Bitfinex now support numerous markets for tokens and fiat currency pairs. Further, an emerging market of decentralized exchanges and protocols like EtherDelta and 0x is growing, all of which diversifies what was once a centralized and bitcoin-dominated trading market.  The demand side of the equation has also seen increased inflows as all-time-high prices and increased media attention led to new users pouring into the cryptocurrency space, with major exchanges like Poloniex and Coinbase experiencing record growth and trading across assets.  Conclusion  The allocation of cryptocurrency trading across exchanges and currencies has changed markedly over the years due to sentiment, regulation, hacks and business decisions by exchanges to support new trading pairs.  In March, the SEC rejected two bitcoin ETFs, citing the lack of significant regulated markets and industry concentration in China. Around the same time, the markets saw a notable decrease in volume from China and an increase from South Korea and Japan after significant regulatory guidance.  Since, trading volume compositions have remained more diverse than ever across bitcoin and ethereum, and the industry has seen both pushes to reconsider a bitcoin ETF and consider a new ethereum ETF. We will undoubtedly see future initiatives for new types of structured products as the market continues to mature.  The biggest change, however, could continue to be the sharp decrease in bitcoin's dominance should ethereum and other tokens capture a larger percentage of overall trading in a more diverse set of markets.

42379503,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX88P5V,1497168055,The Legal Future of Cryptocurrencies in Brazil,"Jonathan Darcie has a PhD and Masters in General Theory of Law and Tax Law, and is partner of a law firm in Brazil with ongoing consulting for digital currency businesses.  In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Darcie speaks out about proposed cryptocurrency rules in Brazil, arguing that attempts to regulate the industry at this stage are premature and misguided.      Living in Brazil over the last four years has been an experience of watching a real and live – and even more interesting, some would say – version of TV's ""House of Cards"".  The still in-course criminal investigation called 'Operação Lava Jato' (Operation Car Wash) has become the most comprehensive criminal investigation in the history of Brazil, sending many dozens of politicians, CEOs and executives of the most important Brazilian companies to prison.  At the same time, the country has entered the most intense recession of its history, leading businesses to bankruptcy, millions of people to unemployment and setting up a scenario of economic chaos.  It is within this window of never-seen-before-events (the last one being a wiretap of the actual president of Brazil) that the Brazilian House of Representatives is doing something else unprecedented – initiating a debate about regulating bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  The environment today  When reading the news that a legislative commission will study and regulate cryptocurrencies, one might have the impression that local startups will now have limitless freedom to transact and form businesses.  Unfortunately, that's not even close to the reality of any business in Brazil.  As it happens with nations that have their legal system built under a civil law tradition, every innovation that emerges joins the current status quo to become legally equivalent of other similar technologies.  Back in 2009, if someone living under Brazilian law made his or her first transaction buying and selling bitcoin at a profit, they had to pay (or should have paid) income tax in order of 15% of its capital gains (unless the total amount involved was less than to R$35,000 ($10,600) in a month, when a tax exemption was applicable).  This means the current situation is the same for cryptocurrencies as it is for guitars, books or any other goods involved in transactions.  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were never legal currencies under Brazilian law, though a federal law issued a definition of digital currency by declaring it as a resource stored in a device or electronic system.  As this definition didn't capture the nature of cryptocurrencies in general – covering private cryptographic keys instead of 'digital currency' itself – their legal status is given by Brazilian Civil Code, which defines them as regular assets. Being a movable asset means that transactions are possible without any kind of restriction – except for the duty of paying taxes and declaring its property to Brazilian IRS.  The business impact  For businesses, the requirements are a bit more complicated.  It's not easy to have a business in Brazil. Anyone wanting to do so needs to hire an accountant and a lawyer to prepare a contract equivalent to the articles of organization in the US. Afterwards, there is the need to obtain a taxpayer ID issued by the federal, state and municipal governments.  Small businesses are obliged to deliver monthly and annual income information for tax purposes (normally to more than one branch), including information about employees. The obligations more than double for larger businesses.  The exact same process is applied to digital currency businesses. It doesn't matter if we are speaking of an exchange, wallet or payment service: there is not much freedom involved.  But differently from most businesses, cryptocurrency-related ventures that deal directly with large sums of money, securities, art, jewelry or other assets are subject to very specific duties regarding anti-money laundering policies and compliance in general.  These obligations and duties were enacted in 1998 through a federal law written more than 10 years before the first bitcoin transaction happened.  It is therefore required that digital currency businesses comply with strict compliance policies and keep logs of transactions made within its field of operation, reporting activities considered suspicious to the federal council that controls financial activities.  The congressional debate  Considering the intent of congress to specifically regulate cryptocurrencies, most people at this point might be asking: ""What is left to be regulated?""  Congressmen involved in the special commission gave statements covering tax aspects and the relation of digital currencies with criminal activities, though this suggests they don't have a strong familiarity with the current legal status of cryptocurrencies.  It's notable then that the timing of the debate follows a recent kidnapping in which criminals asked for the ransom to be paid with monero and z-cash. Just a few weeks later, the WannaCry ransomware attack struck international organizations, bringing negative attention to bitcoin.  It may have seemed like an opportunity for Congress to present the public opinion with a (supposedly) good agenda.  First presented in 2015, the discussed bill adds nothing to the digital currency legal environment.  There are three goals in the bill:  To consider digital currency payments to be legally payment arrangements, which they already are due to its legal definition  To declare that digital currency businesses must comply to the federal law of consumer protection, something that they indisputably already have to  To state that operations involving digital currencies are subject to anti-money laundering policies, which they already are, as previously explained.  So as long as the bill passes in the current form, owners and businesses should be just fine.  Given the tradition of complicating things and the Brazilian actual political crisis, however, 'just fine' might be simply too much to ask for.
