35068350,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649462,1729724434,Bitcoin Bears Lose Control As BTC Net-Taker Volume Shifts Positive,"Bitcoin has been on an impressive surge since early September, rising by 31% from local lows around $53,000. However, after testing the $69,500 supply level, the cryptocurrency faces selling pressure. Despite this, Bitcoin remains strong, holding above the previous high of around $66,000, a crucial level determining its next move. Related Reading: Solana Could ‚ÄòGo Parabolic‚Äô Starting Today ‚Äì Analyst Sets $370 Target Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that, despite recent bearish attempts, bears are losing control in the futures market. A key indicator has flipped bullish for the first time since July, suggesting that the current selling pressure may not be enough to push Bitcoin lower. With Bitcoin in a critical phase, holding above the $66,000 level would signal continued strength and maintain the uptrend for the coming weeks. Investors are watching closely, as Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to stay above this support could pave the way for new highs and further momentum in the bullish cycle. Bitcoin Taker Buyers Starting To Breathe Crypto analyst Maartunn shared recent data from CryptoQuant, revealing that Bitcoin taker buyers in the futures market have struggled to gain an advantage over taker sellers throughout the past year. Maartunn highlighted a chart showing that the BTC net taker volume has turned positive for the first time since July, signaling a potential shift in momentum. The present trend change suggests that bears are beginning to lose control over Bitcoin‚Äôs price action, with buyers starting to gain strength. This data points to an accumulation phase, where Bitcoin‚Äôs price has been suppressed by large investors, keeping it from making significant gains or marking new monthly lows. The fact that BTC hasn‚Äôt posted new lows despite previous bearish pressure reinforces the view that an accumulation period may end, and a new bullish phase could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Breakout Confirmed ‚Äì Top Analyst Predicts $3,400 Target The coming weeks are critical for Bitcoin, particularly with the approaching U.S. presidential election on November 5. Historically, elections introduce volatility and uncertainty into financial markets; this year is no exception. Broader market trends likely influence Bitcoin‚Äôs price action, and traders are watching closely to see how BTC responds to these developments. If Bitcoin maintains its upward momentum, a rally to new highs could follow in the weeks after the election. BTC Testing Crucial Support Bitcoin is currently trading at $66,400 after a healthy retrace from its recent high of $69,500. The price now finds support at $66,000, which acted as a key resistance in late September and has since flipped into a crucial demand zone for BTC. This support is essential for the bulls to maintain control, as holding above $66,000 signals strength and keeps the momentum alive for another attempt at breaking the $70,000 mark. If Bitcoin can hold steady above this support level, the next logical target would be to challenge the $70,000 resistance, which has proven difficult to breach. A successful push past this level would likely trigger further upside, potentially driving BTC into new price discovery. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above $0.12 Level ‚Äì Time For DOGE To Catch Up? However, if the price exceeds $66,000, a retrace to lower demand levels could occur. In this case, the daily 200 moving average at $63,300 is the next key area where Bitcoin could find support before resuming its upward trend. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether BTC can maintain its bullish trajectory or if a deeper pullback is on the horizon.

From a price tag as low as $10 to nearly $4,900 in the past, it‚Äôs very obvious that ETH has made quite a few early believers. And while taking such wild rides can be full of gut-wrenching moments, Ethereum never failed to ensure that its core strength lies in the facilitation of smart contracts and decentralized applications in the blockchain space. However, Ethereum‚Äôs cost basis for many investors has risen as the market has matured. This has made short-term gains more elusive, leading some traders to approach the market cautiously. But for those with a long-term view, Ethereum‚Äôs ambitious roadmap and history of overcoming challenges continue to make it an attractive option. Ethereum: The Next Path Ethereum‚Äôs present pricing behavior has one of more fascinating technical aspects: its interaction with the Point of Control (POC). Often considered as a significant support or resistance, this level could be crucial in deciding Ethereum‚Äôs next direction. As ETH‚Äôs price hovers near this point, it suggests a possible buying opportunity for those looking at the long term. If the POC holds, Ethereum could build a solid foundation for future growth. But a break below this level might signal trouble ahead, so investors should stay cautious.

42373509,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnUSl,1729719448,"Citibank Debanked Ripple's Brad Garlinghouse Due to Crypto, Exec Says","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has personally been severed from a longtime banking relationship because he's a prominent figure in crypto, he told an audience in Washington on Wednesday.  ""Individuals within the crypto industry are being de-banked,"" he said at DC Fintech Week. ""I personally have been de-banked.""  Garlinghouse tied his own experience to the wider trend in the U.S. industry that's struggled to maintain banking ties as regulators have cautioned institutions to limit their crypto involvement.  He later added in an interview with CoinDesk that the institution that cut him off recently was Citigroup Inc., with which he'd been a customer for about 25 years, he said. And he added that it's not the only personal banking relationship he's lost because of his role in crypto.  ""They said, 'You have five days to move your money,"" he said. ""They were actually super honest. They're like, 'Look, you are a notable person in crypto, and having notable people in crypto, and banking the crypto industry means more scrutiny from federal regulators.""  The CEO was highly critical of President Joe Biden's administration in Washington, saying Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has led a ""reign of terror,"" and accusing the U.S. Treasury Department and banking regulator Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of being ""hostile"" to the industry. He said that whichever way the U.S. presidential elections go next month, the future for crypto policy will be better.  ""No matter what happens, we're going to see a reset,"" he said.  He also said that an exchange-traded fund (ETF) pegged to the price of XRP was ""inevitable"" during his remarks.  Garlinghouse and Ripple have been among the chief backers of the Fairshake political action committee, the pro-crypto group that has been among the dominant campaign-finance forces in the 2024 elections. Apart from personally supporting the political opponent of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), he isn't endorsing either major U.S. political party and said he was wearing a purple tie on Wednesday for a reason.  The primary indicator of the next administration's crypto stance will be who the president appoints at agencies such as the SEC, Treasury, OCC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  ""It'll be telling as to what the direction of travel is for the next four years,"" Garlinghouse said. ""No matter what, we're going to end up in a better place."" ""When we look back on this period of time in the United States as it relates to crypto, it's going to look like a speed bump,"" he said.  Still, when asked what advice he'd give to a crypto startup right now, he said they should incorporate outside the U.S. ""I hate saying that,"" he said. ""I'll be honest: I grew up in Kansas. I'm a pro-U.S. guy.""  But he said there's too much uncertainty about protecting a company from being sued by regulators in the U.S., as Ripple was by the SEC.  A Citi spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.

Lately, the price of Dogecoin has been on a major decline, failing to break key resistance levels. However, with this new prediction by the crypto analyst, Dogecoin could see its value potentially increasing to new highs. Dogecoin Price To See Massive 5,202% Pump A crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄòZero‚Äô on X (formerly Twitter) has expressed excitement about an incoming price pump for Dogecoin. The analyst suggested via his post that the Dogecoin price looks ready for a major rally, likely due to favorable market conditions and key technical indicators. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Why The Bitcoin Price Saw Sharp Crash Below $67,000 Sharing a historical chart illustrating the¬†DOGE price movements from as far back as 2014, Zero pinpointed periods when the Dogecoin price experienced massive rallies, specifically during the bull run that followed each Bitcoin halving event. From 2017 to 2018, the analyst disclosed that the price of Dogecoin had skyrocketed by 9,226.49%. After experiencing a bear market and a prolonged period of price fluctuations, the meme coin witnessed another massive surge between 2020 and 2021. At the time, Dogecoin had recorded a whopping 30,693.75% price increase, leading to its current all-time high of $0.74. Based on these bullish trends, Zero has predicted that the Dogecoin price could see its next rally between 2024 and 2025. He forecasted that the popular meme coin could experience a whopping 5,202.19% price increase towards the $5 mark. This massive surge in value would effectively push Dogecoin above its previous all-time high in 2021. Moreso, assuming the cryptocurrency can hit $5, this would represent a 50X increase from its current price of $0.139. Moving forward, Zero has declared that this projected price increase has been a long-awaited moment for DOGE holders, suggesting that there has been a build-up of anticipation for a bull run over the past three years. In addition to a Dogecoin price increase, the analyst also expects Bitcoin (BTC) to surge to new highs. A DOGE ATH Could Be Closer Than Investors Think Many analysts in the crypto market appear to be highly optimistic about Dogecoin‚Äôs price outlook. Notably, a crypto analyst on X, identified as ‚ÄòCEO‚Äô has told his 471,600 followers that the Dogecoin price could be getting ready for another all-time high soon.

35062866,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649470,1729713621,ApeCoin Faces Strong Resistance As Bears Seize Control At $1.755,"ApeCoin is facing a tough setback as bearish momentum intensifies, with the price hitting a strong resistance at $1.755. After an attempt to push higher, the bulls have lost ground, allowing the bears to take control and halt the upward movement. Particularly, this key resistance level has emerged as a significant barrier, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. With pessimistic pressure mounting, ApeCoin‚Äôs future direction hangs in the balance, as traders look for signs of whether the bulls can stage a recovery or if the bears will drive prices lower in the coming days. This article analyzes ApeCoin‚Äôs struggle against strong resistance at the $1.755 level, focusing on how the bears have gained control of the market. It explores the factors driving the current bearish strength, examines key support and resistance levels, and assesses the likelihood of further downside pressure or a potential bullish recovery. Bearish Momentum Builds As ApeCoin Hits Key Resistance Recently, APE‚Äôs price has turned bearish on the 4-hour chart, pulling back towards the $1 mark and the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) after encountering strong resistance at $1.755. This retracement marks a notable shift in momentum, as the bulls failed to maintain their upward push, allowing bears to take control. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a significant decline, with the signal line dropping to 49% from its previous peak of 92%. Typically, a fall below the critical 50% threshold suggests that bears are gaining control of the market, possibly leading to more downside if the RSI continues to trend lower. Related Reading: Is Apecoin On Your Radar? APE Soars By 30% In 48 Hours, Signaling A Potential Bull Run Also, the daily chart for ApeCoin shows increasing negative sentiment, with negative candlesticks and a decline toward the 100-day SMA, reflecting rising selling pressure as ApeCoin struggles to hold higher levels. If bulls don‚Äôt defend the current support, additional declines are possible, making the 100-day SMA a critical level to watch for either a potential reversal or continued downward movement. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI has fallen to 65%, down from its previous position in the overbought zone suggesting that buying pressure has eased and that the market could be entering a period of consolidation or possible pullback. Support Levels To Watch Amidst Bears‚Äô Control As bearish momentum strengthens, key support levels become crucial in determining ApeCoin‚Äôs next move. The first level to watch is the $1 mark, a psychological and technical support that could help prevent further declines for ApeCoin. Related Reading: Is Apecoin On Your Radar? APE Soars By 30% In 48 Hours, Signaling A Potential Bull Run Meanwhile, if bears push the price below this, the next significant support lies around $0.66. A break below these levels could lay the groundwork for additional losses, as sellers would likely increase pressure. However, if APE‚Äôs bulls manage to stage a recovery at the $1 support level, the price of ApeCoin could begin to rebound toward the $1.755 resistance. A successful breakout above this resistance could pave the way for more upward movement, potentially targeting the $2.1 level and beyond, signaling a stronger bullish resurgence.

Among major tokens, ether fared particularly poorly, falling 5%.  SOL/ETH notched a new all-time high, while ETH/BTC made new lows.  Cryptocurrencies bled lower on Wednesday alongside a slide in traditional markets across the board.  The CoinDesk 20 ‚Äì an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and exchange coins ‚Äì was down 2.6% in the last 24 hours, with Chainlink {{LINK}} the worst performing, slumping 7.6%.

The SOL/ETH trading pair notched a decisive new all-time high by rising 6.3% to 0.068 amid renewed debate in the crypto community about the wisdom behind Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap.  ‚ÄúMuch of the poor sentiment and questions around Ethereum's roadmap is due to recent underperformance versus BTC and SOL,‚Äù Brian Rudick, director of research at crypto trading firm GSR, posted on X.  ‚ÄúHowever, this is a poor comparison as BTC and SOL were subject to two large idiosyncratic events,‚Äù Rudick wrote, namely, the immense success of the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, and the impact of the FTX collapse ‚Äì and Solana‚Äôs resurgence from the ashes ‚Äì on investor perception.  ‚ÄúMeasuring from crypto's ATH market cap in Nov 2021 to remove [the FTX collapse] shows ETH and SOL have had [about] the same performance,‚Äù Rudick added.  The looming U.S. election, only two weeks away, didn't appear to offer any assistance either. Even with crypto-friendly Donald Trump in the lead (based on betting markets), and Vice President Kamala Harris appearing less adversarial towards crypto than the current administration, markets will have difficulty ‚Äúbreaking upwards before election day,‚Äù Joe Edwards, head of research at digital assets broker Enigma Securities, wrote in a research report.

The bond market was also lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising to a three-month high of 4.25%. Making record highs on seemingly a daily basis of late, gold also pulled back, slipping 1.1% to $2,730 per ounce. The price of oil fell 1.35% to $70.77 per barrel.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry folks Tesla will save the market when they report earnings,‚Äù Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of crypto investment advisor Lumida Wealth, posted on X. ‚ÄúOverall, I‚Äôd say we are closer to the end of this move of pricing in higher for longer‚Ä¶ November is looking very good in my view.‚Äù  Tesla is due to report its quarterly results after this afternoon's market close.

42373517,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnV3Z,1729712791,Trump Polymarket Odds Briefly Dip After His No. 2 Bull Adds Bet on Harris,"Donald Trump's odds on Polymarket of winning the U.S. presidential election temporarily dipped Wednesday after the prediction market's second largest holder of ""yes"" shares in a victory for the Republican nominee placed bets on his opponent.  Theo4 has amassed 12 million ""yes"" shares in a Trump victory, second only to Fredi9999. These whales' trades have come under scrutiny from market watchers and media outlets in the last week or so (Some observers have speculated that these two, and three other Polymarket accounts, are controlled by the same individual or group, outside the U.S.). Wednesday afternoon in New York, however, Theo4 appeared to hedge his (or her or their) bets, buying blocks of ""no"" shares for Trump and ""yes"" shares for Kamala Harris, before resuming Trump ""yes"" share purchases.  Each share pays out $1 (in the USDC stablecoin) if the prediction comes true and zero if not, so the price, expressed in cents on the dollar, reflects the market's assessment of a candidate's probability of winning (in the case of ""yes"" shares) or losing (for ""no"" shares).  Trump's odds slipped from 65% before Theo4's uncharacteristic trades to as low as 59%, before rebounding to as high as 64%. At press time they were at 63%.  Flip Pidot, a veteran prediction market trader who has been closely tracking Polymarket whale trades, attributed the short-lived dip to Theo4 in a post on X (formerly Twitter).  In recent days, a flurry of mainstream media outlets and (often pro-Harris) social media posters have suggested, with varying degrees of certainty, that pro-Trump forces are manipulating Polymarket to make his chances look higher than they are. These claims cite heavy buying by Fredi9999, Theo4, and other Trump whales.  Betting market proponents counter that anyone who tried to distort these markets would create opportunities for traders with solid information to eat their lunch.  Read more: No, Polymarket Whales Aren't Evidence of Prediction Market Manipulation  Polymarket bars U.S. traders under a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, although clever Americans have circumvented the geofencing using VPNs.

35061030,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649448,1729710025,$13 Billion Bitcoin ETF Surge: US Institutions Lead The Charge,"American institutions are making ripples in the cryptocurrency market, having invested a staggering $13 billion in spot Bitcoin ETF shares since its inception in January 2024. Many people are surprised by this move, given that traditional financial institutions were first hesitant to enter the world of digital assets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rockets 30% In A Week, Sparking Hype For Uptober Rally According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, 1,179 institutions currently own a total of 193,064 BTC, indicating a major shift in opinion towards crypto investments. Institutional Adoption Grows The adoption of Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has contributed significantly to the spike in institutional interest. This legal approval has created new opportunities for financial institutions to provide cryptocurrency investments, allowing them to tap into more revenue streams. Institutional ownership of U.S. #Bitcoin Spot ETFs is around 20%, with asset managers holding 193K BTC (per Form 13F filings). pic.twitter.com/9YTOEH3G5w ‚Äî Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) October 22, 2024 Big Chunk Of The Pie Interestingly, big players such as Millennium Management and Jane Street now hold over 20% of the total market through various Bitcoin ETFs worth about 961,645 BTC. This rapid absorption immediately shows that the anxiety over money related to digital currency was shorter-lived. Analysts think the more the establishments engage with Bitcoin ETF, the price will keep going. Even so, the current price of Bitcoin stands at around $67,000 and is likely to go to $100,000 in early 2025, based on past trends, but more importantly, how people‚Äôs thinking is changing towards embracing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Options Trading Approved Another major turning point came when the SEC lately approved options trading for spot Bitcoin ETFs on NYSE American LLC and CBOE. This implies that with conventional financial instruments, institutional investors can now effectively reduce their Bitcoin exposure. A big change has happened for institutional buyers since they can now trade options on these ETFs. It not only makes Bitcoin easier to use, but it also makes it more like regular banking. Now that options trading is possible, experts think that more institutional buyers will get into the Bitcoin market. Institutional investors‚Äô ability to trade ETF options is a turning point. Bitcoin becomes increasingly accessible and integrated into standard banking. Now that options trading is possible, experts expect more institutional investors to join Bitcoin.

Institutions‚Äô continued engagement with this asset class is anticipated to have a favorable impact on other digital assets. The SEC‚Äôs regulatory system provides a layer of protection that many investors value. This clarity may lead to increasing participation from traditional financial institutions, thus cementing Bitcoin‚Äôs position in the investment scene. Overall, the combination of institutional demand and governmental support suggests that Bitcoin is more than a passing fad; it is becoming an essential component of modern finance. As time passes, it will be interesting to see how this changing landscape affects both the digital currency market and broader economic trends.

42373520,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnVOb,1729707668,"Solana Hits Record vs. Ether, Outperforms Bitcoin as AI Memecoin Frenzy and Surging Revenues Fuel Rally","Solana's SOL has outperformed ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) as blockchain activity is booming on the network.  The latest memecoin trend of artificial intelligence agents promoting and investing in tokens is mostly centered on Solana.  Open interest for solana futures increased by almost 3 million SOL, or $506 million through the past four days.  While the broader crypto market has been consolidating following the quick runup from the early October lows, Solana {{SOL}} has been on a tear against the largest cryptocurrencies.  SOL is the best performing asset in the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index through the past week with a 11% gain, while almost all other constituents lost value, bitcoin's {{BTC}} 2.5% decline and ether's {{ETH}} 3.5% drop among them.  The action has brought SOL to a new all-time record price against rival layer-1 network Ethereum's ether on Tuesday, surpassing the 0.064 level first hit in August, TradingView data shows.  Meanwhile, SOL has also shown relative strength against bitcoin, reaching its highest price versus BTC in more than two months.  The price action happened alongside resurgent speculative activity in memecoins, a big jump in network revenues and rising bullish bets on crypto derivatives markets.  Solana activity booms with memecoin frenzy  Solana has greatly benefitted from the resurging speculative frenzy with memecoins, with most of the activity centered around Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The latest trend, or fad, of artificial intelligence (AI) agents pumping memecoins is also predominantly based on the Solana network.  A primary example is the Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) token, which skyrocketed to over $600 million market capitalization from zero in only two weeks, with Marc Andreessen-funded AI bot known as Truth Terminal heavily promoting it on social media. The token was created on October 10 by an anonymous developer using Pump.fun and got endorsed by Truth Terminal.  ""With that, a whole narrative was born from the intersection of AI, memecoins, and crypto,"" David Zimmerman, DeFi analyst at K33 Research, wrote in a Wednesday report. ""AI memecoins have gained massive attention over the last two weeks, with many tokens reaching over $100 million market cap.""  The memecoin frenzy drove blockchain activity on Solana to fresh highs. Network revenues from transaction fees surpassed $4 million per day on Tuesday nearing the records in March, increasing by tenfold since early September lows, Token Terminal shows. Meanwhile, active users on the chain rose to record highs of over 8 million.  Higher revenues also dampen the token's inflation, with now over 15% of newly issued tokens being destroyed, or burned, per Blockworks data.  Open interest soars  Open interest on the SOL futures markets climbed to over 18 million SOL, or $3.09 billion, the highest amount in notional value since January 2023, CoinGlass shows. In the past four days alone, open interest has increased by almost 3 million SOL worth $506 million.  Open interest refers to unsettled futures bets or the total amount of funds allocated in open futures contracts. It is one of the best ways to determine whether new money is entering the market. It can be measured in a native token terms like solana {{SOL}} notional value. Native token is the preferred denominator as the notional value is influenced by the rise or fall of the asset's price. A spike in leverage can contribute to market volatility, and if prices start to move one way or the other, we could see a high amount of short or long liquidations.  Funding rates for perpetuals stand at 10% annualized, which measures the price longs have to pay to short traders to keep their perpetual futures position open, indicating that most of the bets are longs, anticipating prices climbing higher.

Network News  Schematic of QuarkID architecture, from the project documentation (QuarkID)  MUNICIPAL INTEGRATION: The city of Buenos Aires has launched a digital identity service designed to strengthen residents' privacy using zero-knowledge proofs, a type of cryptography that long predates but often bolsters cryptocurrencies. The service, QuarkID, has been integrated into miBA, the city's seven-year-old app for accessing municipal services and documents. The idea, in short, is to give 3.6 million porte√±os ‚Äì residents of Buenos Aires ‚Äì greater control over their personal information. The ZK proofs will let users show that a document has indeed been authenticated by the government without disclosing information that is irrelevant to the task at hand. The development has got some industry executives buzzing: ""It sounds like if this goes well, other countries in the region, like Uruguay, could follow suit,"" Harrison Seletsky, director of business development at digital identity platform SPACE ID, told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.  ELECTION PUSH. Is dark money is manipulating prediction markets? A mysterious high-stakes bettor, identified as ""Fredi9999,"" has spent $25 million solely betting on Trump across prediction markets, according to research done by Polymarket whale ""Domer."" Fredi, according to on-chain detective work done by Domer, appears to operate under multiple accounts ‚Äì Fredi9999, PrincessCaro, Michie and Theo ‚Äì funded through sizable Kraken deposits (in precise amounts like $500,000 or $1 million). The matter has drawn mainstream media attention, from the likes of the Wall Street Journal and Reuters, while inspiring speculation over whether the trader was ""spending heavily to 'paint the tape' and make a Trump victory appear more likely.""  DE-REBRANDING? The DeFi project formerly known as Maker, now known as Sky, could soon be formerly known as Sky, once again known as Maker. The reconsideration of its recent marketing and branding overhaul came in response to a lukewarm reception, and after a successful launch of the USDS stablecoin. ‚ÄúIt is also now more clear than ever just how much the DeFi community loves and trusts the Maker brand,‚Äù Sky co-founder Rune Christensen wrote on its governance forum. ""There was a lot of affinity for the brand and what it stands for: stability, security, and DeFi scale. And there is a lot of commitment to holding the MKR token versus upgrading to SKY.""  XRP FOR HARRIS! Ripple co-founder and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen said he's pitching in with $10 million in XRP tokens to the political action committee Future Forward, in support of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's run for president as the Democratic candidate. ""It's time for the Democrats to have a new approach to tech innovation, including crypto,"" he wrote, adding that Harris ""will ensure that American technology dominates the world.""

Frost/Wikipedia, modified by CoinDesk using PhotoMosh)  Satflow, a Bitcoin infrastructure firm focused on the Ordinals and Runes ecosystems, has introduced a decentralized exchange (DEX) for professional traders ‚Äì positioned as a less-expensive alternative to the popular NFT marketplace Magic Eden. In a press release shared with CoinDesk, Satflow said that its fees initially will be 0%, claiming they would be a couple percentage points lower than Magic Eden's. The new DEX's aim is to eliminate the practice of mempool sniping, which is when users exploit the time lag in which a transaction is waiting to be added to a Bitcoin block.  Coinbase Institutional Research wrote in a weekly report, referring to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin's recent blog posts on the blockchain's project roadmap, that ""the majority of the content remains largely academic and unlikely to be a near-term market driver.""

Not Don Wilson, the Trader Who Beat the Regulator Once Before  Justin Sun Might Be Good for Wrapped Bitcoin, Says New Custodian's Director  Sign with Justin Sun's image in foreground of Tron party at Bitcoin Nasvhille in July (Bradley Keoun)  In August, the mere disclosure that Tron founder Justin Sun was involved in the custody operations related to wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) ‚Äì a popular token in decentralized finance ‚Äì was enough to rattle the crypto industry.  At least one major decentralized finance (DeFi) project considered eliminating WBTC completely as a collateral option, and several major crypto players, including the exchange Coinbase, rushed out competing products.  Sun is seen as controversial by some crypto industry analysts, owing to his involvement in various stablecoin projects that turned turbulent, and in other instances where a lack of transparency was cited.  BitGo, the original and longtime custodian of the bitcoin backing WBTC, announced on Aug. 9 that it would distribute control over the project's custody to three entities globally instead of just one ‚Äì as a way of helping to decentralize the operation. According to the release, BiT Global is a global custody platform with regulated operations based in Hong Kong, registered as a Trust and Company Service Provider (TCSP), and is a ""a strategic partnership between BitGo, Justin Sun and the Tron ecosystem.""  WBTC is a token that allows investors to use bitcoin (BTC) on other blockchains, and plays a key role in lending DeFi as collateral, with a $9 billion market capitalization.  BiTGlobal is now one of three holders of the keys overseeing the bitcoin in custody, project officials have confirmed.  But what if Sun's involvement is a strength rather than a liability?  This argument was made to CoinDesk this week by BitGlobal director Robert Liu, in an exclusive interview.  What exactly is Sun's role with the project? And who owns it? We got some clarity, but not total clarity.

The following is an excerpt:  The slow decline of Litecoin offers valuable lessons for the cryptocurrency community and future projects:  Continuous Innovation: Projects must continuously innovate to stay relevant in the fast-paced cryptocurrency landscape. Stagnation can lead to obsolescence as newer and more advanced technologies emerge.  Clear Use Case: Maintaining a clear and compelling use case is essential for long-term success. Projects that fail to adapt to changing market demands and technological advancements risk losing their relevance.  Community Engagement: A strong and engaged community is vital for a project's sustainability. Active development, transparent communication, and community involvement can foster loyalty and support.  Strategic Leadership: Leadership decisions can significantly impact a project's trajectory. Transparent and committed leadership is crucial for maintaining trust and confidence within the community.  Litecoin's story highlights the complexities of sustaining relevance and adoption in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Despite its initial success and substantial market valuation, Litecoin has struggled to keep pace with technological advancements and changing market dynamics. The lessons learned from its decline underscore the importance of continuous innovation, clear use cases, community engagement, and strategic leadership in building and sustaining successful cryptocurrency projects. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, these insights can guide new and existing projects toward long-term success and relevance.

Ahead of the burn, Terra Classic community members have also been told to withdraw their assets locked on the Shuttle Bridge, as it will also be closed during the LUNC burn and never be opened again. Terraform Lab‚Äôs imminent LUNC burn is undoubtedly a positive for the coin, as this could provide much-needed bullish momentum and lead to a significant price surge. Moreover, this aligns with the Terra Classic community‚Äôs mission to remove as many coins as possible from circulation to revive LUNC. They believe this deflationary mechanism could help send the coin back to its current all-time high (ATH) of $119. LUNC Metrics data shows that 135.54 billion coins have been burned since these token burns began on May 13, 2022. Meanwhile, 303.6 million coins have been burnt in the last seven days. However, the community still has a lot of work to do, considering that LUNC still has a circulating supply of 6.76 trillion. Other Steps Taken By The Terra Classic Community In addition to LUNC burns, the Terra Classic community has taken other steps to help revive the coin and restore it to its glory days. This includes developing proposals to improve the LUNC ecosystem and promote the coin‚Äôs adoption. The most recent proposal is from OrbitLabs to remove the forked mainline modules from the Terra Classic blockchain. The proposal states that this will help improve maintainability, reduce technical debt, and align with the broader Cosmos ecosystem. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle, Next Stop $3,400? OrbitLabs further highlighted the current situation in the LUNC ecosystem to show why this proposal is necessary. According to them, the Terra Classic codebase uses several forked versions of Cosmos modules to accommodate its unique features. This has led to the codebase diverging from the upstream modules and increasing maintenance costs. Therefore, this new approach will help ensure that the Terra Classic blockchain is current with the latest securities and features from the Cosmos development team. This will help massively reduce maintenance costs and time. At the time of writing, LUNC is trading at around $0.0000925, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

35057556,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649445,1729702854,Crypto Analyst Unveils The ‚ÄòTrue Time To Sell It All‚Äô: Here‚Äôs When,"In an analysis shared on X, crypto analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) has provided an in-depth macro outlook on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), suggesting that the next significant market peak‚Äîand potentially the ideal time to ‚Äúsell it all‚Äù‚Äîmay occur in the second half of 2025. ‚ÄúAnother month and a half has passed, and the full macro breakout thesis is really pushing many eyes onto the crypto charts now,‚Äù Astronomer states. Reflecting on his earlier predictions, he notes, ‚ÄúLast time we posted our plan of a Q4 upside breakout, BTC was at $58k and ETH was at $2.3k.‚Äù Since then, Bitcoin has risen by 20% and Ethereum by 13%, moves that occurred ‚Äúagainst all the low timeframe technical analysis users‚Äô belief, before the full breakout even happened.‚Äù When Will This Crypto Bull Run End? Astronomer emphasizes that traditional order flow and price action analysis are less effective on higher time frames, leading him to seek ‚Äúedge elsewhere‚Äù through multiple data analyses. ‚ÄúWe had our thesis in place, with multiple data analyses supporting not only that the low is in, but also that we likely would see a high timeframe breakout,‚Äù he explains. Related Reading: Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Strategy To ‚ÄòMake Millions‚Äô By March 2025 Delving into Bitcoin‚Äôs macro perspective, Astronomer uses a combination of time, sentiment, and volume to identify weekly cycle lows. ‚ÄúThe Middle East capitulation event [Israel-Iran tensions] clearly formed that, timed well 28 weeks after the previous weekly cycle low,‚Äù he observes. With the next weekly low not expected until late December, he sees ‚Äústill room for upside‚Äù and anticipates that ‚Äúprice [will] accelerate here.‚Äù Addressing market psychology, he cautions, ‚ÄúThe market always finds a way to escape on the low timeframes as most traders (‚Äòinvestors‚Äô) find themselves trapped into short term memory fallacy and simply forget the high timeframe picture.‚Äù Astronomer remains confident in his projection, stating, ‚ÄúOverall peak is still expected in the second half of 2025, where I think the true time to ‚Äòsell it all‚Äô may occur.‚Äù For Ethereum, Astronomer notes a similar but compressed cyclical pattern compared to Bitcoin. ‚ÄúETH typically drops later near the 4-year cycle peaks (2014, 2018, 2022) and has its surge also later in the 4-year cycle (2016, 2020), making its moves seem more aggressive,‚Äù he explained. Related Reading: Crypto Craze: Investor Nets A 3,360% Gain, Turning $86,000 Into $3.75 Million He also addresses the current sentiment towards Ethereum and other layer-1 protocols: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear by now that ‚Äòuseful‚Äô coins are deemed ‚Äòuseless‚Äô, typical things called for when price doesn‚Äôt move. Yet anyone who even remotely used ETH knows what it can do.‚Äù Astronomer attributes the stagnation in utility growth to cyclical and sentimental factors, noting, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen massive hype around it in 2021 and that simply hasn‚Äôt been digested yet.‚Äù While maintaining a bullish outlook, Astronomer acknowledges the possibility of unforeseen events that could disrupt the market. ‚ÄúDespite all the data, there still always is a small chance I‚Äôm wrong,‚Äù he admitted. Citing potential global crises like ‚ÄúWorld War 3 (WW3)‚Äù or ‚Äúthe end of a nation,‚Äù he warns that such events ‚Äúcan always pull down the market significantly,‚Äù potentially causing Bitcoin to drop ‚Äúback below $50k.‚Äù However, he remains steadfast in his strategy: ‚ÄúCycles are powerful in nature, and we‚Äôve shown why those events shouldn‚Äôt faze you. I will indeed hold on in that case, hedged with large shorts well timed and just continue to ride out the cycle as I do think price will recover from there.‚Äù Overall, the analyst cautions traders against losing sight of the broader picture due to short-term market movements: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll start to question why‚Ä¶ But so far, so good.‚Äù When asked by a user, ‚ÄúWow! You think BTC could hit $350k? That‚Äôs incredible!‚Äù, Astronomer clarified his position: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. Optical illusion on the chart. It‚Äôs more $150-200k I think we can reach.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $66,475.

Despite the dip, Solana has shown resilience, though the past few hours have been marked by short-term volatility with rapid price fluctuations. Investors are closely monitoring the next moves as Solana navigates this uncertain phase. Related Reading: 53% Of Binance Traders Are Shorting Bitcoin ‚Äì What Does This Mean For Price Action? Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis suggesting a potential surge for SOL in the coming days, with a target of $176. His analysis highlights key bullish patterns, but concerns about the broader market correction could drag Solana down if the correction intensifies. With the market in flux, the next few days will be crucial for SOL. Investors watch closely for signs of strength or weakness that could influence the price action. While optimism remains for a potential surge, caution is warranted as the market correction unfolds. Solana Testing Previous Supply As Demand Solana is currently at a critical level, holding strong above $160, a price that had previously acted as resistance since early August. SOL has broken above this level and found support, so it signals a potential shift in the monthly trend that has kept the price suppressed. Investors are watching closely to see if this shift will lead to continued bullish momentum. Crypto analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, offering insight into Solana‚Äôs short-term outlook. He revealed a 1-hour chart showing a symmetrical triangle, a bullish pattern often preceding strong price movements. The upper line of this triangle sits around $168, and Runefelt suggests that if SOL manages to break above this level, the next target would be $176. This would mark a significant push to new local highs, further solidifying Solana‚Äôs bullish trend. As Solana continues to hold above $160, the market is waiting. Investors are exercising patience and are aware that the next few hours and days could be pivotal for SOL‚Äôs price action. Related Reading: XRP Network Activity Surges As Price Seeks To Break $0.55 Resistance If the bullish pattern materializes and the price breaks out, it could lead to a significant rally. However, until that breakout occurs, traders are cautious, knowing that short-term volatility could still impact Solana‚Äôs performance. Technical Levels To Watch Solana is currently trading at $165 after facing a rejection from the $171 mark, a key resistance level that may hold the price down for a few days or weeks. Despite this setback, SOL has shown resilience, rebounding strongly from the daily 200 moving average (MA) at $150 and successfully breaking past the $160 resistance. This breakout is a significant development, signaling a potential upside once the broader market begins pushing up again. Holding above the $160 level is crucial for SOL, reflecting investor confidence and signals strength in the price action. Holding this support level would signal optimism about Solana‚Äôs ability to rally and reach new yearly highs in November. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Breakout Confirmed ‚Äì Top Analyst Predicts $3,400 Target The coming days will determine whether SOL can keep bullish momentum or if a prolonged consolidation below $171 is in.

42415709,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomcx2,1729698518,The Fed Is the Wrong Regulator for Stablecoins,"Stablecoin legislation has been on the cusp of enactment for what seems like ages. The latest effort is Ranking Member of the House Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters‚Äô (D-CA) renewed desire to reach a ‚Äúgrand bargain‚Äù with Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC) to get a bill over the finish line before year end.  It‚Äôs an open question whether the Senate would take up the issue, but Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) recently floated a bill that could serve as the Senate companion to a House effort, or at least provide a starting point for new discussions.  The exact contours of a regulatory framework that could garner sufficient legislative support remain to be seen, but proposed approaches have coalesced around giving the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System a significant role in regulating stablecoin issuers. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs the wrong approach.  Jennifer J. Schulp is the director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute‚Äôs Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives. Jack Solowey is a policy analyst at the center.  There is widespread agreement that legislation is necessary to address stablecoins‚Äîcrypto tokens that are pegged to the value of another asset, like the U.S. dollar. The general idea behind these tokens is that their stable value will promote their use as a digital medium of exchange. Indeed, stablecoin use has been growing globally, with uses including cross-border payments and remittances, as well as facilitating crypto trading. Because transactions with stablecoins can settle nearly instantaneously, some view them as improvements to existing payment rails (which are slower and more costly).  This innovation‚Äîparticularly in an uncertain, and sometimes downright hostile, regulatory environment‚Äîwould benefit from a clear framework that addresses the limited risks stablecoins pose. For stablecoins backed by assets, the biggest risk is that the token is not, in fact, stable. In other words, the risk is that the issuer does not have the assets it claims to have backing the token. The Fed is poorly suited to overseeing a regulatory regime designed to address this risk.  First, and perhaps foremost, the Fed would be conflicted. As an alternative payment service, stablecoins compete with the Fed‚Äôs own payment infrastructure, including FedNow, the central bank's instant payment service. The Fed‚Äôs consideration of a central bank digital currency would leave it further conflicted when regulating privately issued stablecoins, as those two digital representations of the dollar can be seen as substitutes. Any government body, the Fed included, would struggle to objectively analyze private payment innovations that compete with its own services. Giving the Fed the authority to regulate stablecoins unfairly stacks the deck against payment alternatives. Simply put, the fox shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to guard the henhouse.  If the obvious‚Äîand irremediable‚Äîconflicts of interest were not enough, the Fed shouldn‚Äôt be tasked with stablecoin regulation because it isn‚Äôt well-suited to the task. The Fed is a monetary policy specialist that already struggles with its regulatory responsibilities for bank regulation. Giving the Fed regulatory authority over stablecoin issuers doubles down on this failing framework, potentially resulting in subpar regulation of the sector and running the risk of distracting the Fed from its already (overly) ambitious statutory responsibilities.  Moreover, the bank regulatory framework that the Fed is most familiar with is not right for stablecoin regulation. Issuers of fully backed stablecoins should not be treated as if they were fractional reserve banks. The ‚Äùfinancial stability‚Äù concerns that lead regulators to consider bank-like regulations for stablecoins are misplaced.  Stablecoin issuers provide a payment tool, not banking services. The main risk for a stablecoin is that it will lose 1:1 redeemability with the asset it‚Äôs pegged to, such as the U.S. dollar, because the issuer doesn‚Äôt have the reserves it claims to. Basic requirements around collateral and disclosures subject to anti-fraud authority would directly address this. Other regulators are better suited to oversee such a regime, including those more familiar with disclosure-based regulation.  Congress should be applauded for engaging on stablecoin regulation. But such a framework should not give substantial regulatory authority to the Fed, which would lay the groundwork for regulatory decision-making that could decrease competition. If the Fed must remain involved, Congress can mitigate‚Äîbut not eliminate‚Äîthe risks by reducing any discretion granted to the Fed and by narrowly focusing any regulatory regime on disclosures regarding reserves and restrictions on appropriate collateral.  Stablecoins offer the promise of faster, cheaper digital payments. But a Fed-heavy regulatory regime would place private stablecoins at a disadvantage, hindering this innovative technology's potential.

42415722,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomdNo,1729698037,How a Small Crypto Investment Can Improve Your Portfolio,"In recent years, cryptocurrency has evolved from a fringe investment into a mainstream digital asset class that is increasingly being included in diversified portfolios. For investors looking to enhance their portfolio's risk-adjusted returns, adding a crypto allocation can be a compelling strategy. A well-balanced portfolio that includes cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ether has the potential to offer superior returns and a higher Sharpe ratio compared to traditional portfolios made up solely of equities, bonds, or other assets. Let‚Äôs break down why this is the case and look at metrics that demonstrate the advantages of including crypto from a risk/return perspective.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Enhanced returns  Crypto markets have shown explosive growth, far outpacing traditional asset classes in terms of returns. For example, bitcoin has delivered an annualized return of 230% over the past decade, compared to the S&P 500‚Äôs annualized return of around 11%. Ether, another dominant cryptocurrency, has also offered triple-digit annual growth rates in its early years. Even with their volatility, these digital assets provide investors with the potential for significantly higher returns, particularly during periods of market expansion.  By including a small allocation of crypto ‚Äî let‚Äôs say between 2% and 10% ‚Äî in a diversified portfolio, investors can capture some of these gains. Historical data shows that portfolios with even modest exposure to crypto have experienced an uptick in overall performance. For example, a traditional 60/40 portfolio (60% stocks and 40% bonds) might have returned 8% annually over the past decade, but a similar portfolio that allocates 5% to bitcoin could have seen annualized returns closer to 12% or more, all without a significant increase in risk.  Better risk-adjusted returns: the Sharpe ratio advantage  While cryptocurrencies are notorious for their volatility, their inclusion in a portfolio can still improve risk-adjusted returns when managed appropriately. One of the key metrics to assess this is the Sharpe ratio, which measures the return per unit of risk taken. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates that the portfolio is delivering better risk-adjusted returns.  When analyzing data from 2015 to 2023, portfolios with a small crypto allocation show a Sharpe ratio improvement of 0.5 to 0.8 points compared to traditional portfolios. For instance, a traditional portfolio might have a Sharpe ratio of 0.75, but adding 5% bitcoin can elevate it to around 1.2, signifying an optimized balance between risk and reward. The increase in the Sharpe ratio occurs because cryptocurrencies' price movements often have low or negative correlations with traditional asset classes, thus offering better diversification.  Risk mitigation through diversification  Cryptocurrencies are also known for their role as a hedge against inflation and traditional financial market downturns. Since bitcoin in particular has a finite supply, it is often compared to digital gold. During inflationary periods or times of economic instability, having crypto in a portfolio can help offset losses in traditional assets like stocks or bonds.  In conclusion, adding crypto to a portfolio can significantly enhance returns and improve risk-adjusted performance, as evidenced by increased Sharpe ratios. While there is inherent volatility, the proper allocation of this digital asset class can provide a strategic advantage for investors seeking to optimize their risk/return profile.

42415712,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomd7k,1729697806,Tokenized Treasuries: A Game-Changer for Collateral in Crypto Markets,"U.S. Treasuries have long stood as the bedrock of the traditional financial system, serving as collateral across various transactions, from repurchase (repo) agreements to derivatives trading. With an estimated $7.5 trillion in foreign holdings and daily repo transactions exceeding $4 trillion, these secure and liquid assets play a vital role in maintaining market stability and facilitating liquidity.  Recently, tokenized Treasuries have significantly evolved past earlier versions that were typically non-transferable or had inadequate liquidation processes incompatible with new products. The total value of tokenized Treasuries on-chain has reached an all-time high of $2.24 billion. In contrast, stablecoins (tokenized dollars) command a substantial $170+ billion, indicating that tokenized Treasuries are just scratching the surface and poised for rapid growth.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  How Treasuries are used in traditional finance  In the traditional financial system, Treasuries are extensively used as collateral due to their safety, liquidity, lower credit risk, and stability, enabling vast amounts of leverage and liquidity across global markets. Here are some of the key markets where Treasuries play a pivotal role:  Repo markets: Treasuries dominate the repo market, with a daily volume of around $4‚Äì5 trillion, providing a low-risk, high-liquidity form of collateral.  Derivatives and futures markets: In futures and derivatives trading, Treasuries are used to secure contracts involving significant notional value, with annual trading volumes exceeding $100 trillion.  Central clearinghouses: Treasuries serve as collateral for trades in clearinghouses, which handle trillions in collateralized transactions daily.  Securities lending: Treasuries are also utilized in securities lending, contributing to over $1 trillion in outstanding loans.  A new opportunity for crypto markets  The cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems currently lack access to stable, high-quality collateral besides stablecoin. Crypto and DeFi traders typically rely on volatile assets like bitcoin or ether as collateral for loans, staking, and liquidity pools. While effective, this system introduces significant risks, as the value of these assets can fluctuate wildly within short time frames, leading to over collateralization to mitigate risks. The alternative is to post stable coins that only earn a yield to the stablecoin issuers or selected market participants through opaque yield-sharing agreements.  Introducing tokenized Treasuries as collateral provides a better pathway for crypto, similar to what companies do in the previously described TradFi world. Since Treasuries are U.S. government debt, they don‚Äôt suffer from the extreme price swings of crypto or the lack of transparent yield and counterparty risks of using stablecoins. Using tokenized Treasuries can fundamentally reduce risk, expand liquidity, enhance transparency and improve returns by earning yield on the collateral.  Innovations in tokenized treasury products lead to efficiency in ways often lacking in traditional finance. Blockchain technology makes it possible for fully on-chain tokenized treasury funds to allow for rapid issuance, instant redemptions, and instant peer-to-peer trading. This capability makes traditional assets more productive within the crypto ecosystem, opening up new pools of capital.  Factor in all these elements, and you see how tokenized Treasuries can provide a familiar and secure asset that traditional investors already trust. Other potential new types of financial products that could emerge include:  Low-risk loans: Borrowers could access stablecoin loans using tokenized Treasuries without worrying about the extreme volatility of crypto collateral.  Yield products: Tokenized Treasuries could be used in DeFi yield strategies, allowing users to earn returns on secure assets in liquidity pools or lending platforms.  Hedging mechanisms: DeFi users could hedge against the risk of holding highly volatile crypto by introducing Treasuries as collateral.  Tokenizing U.S. Treasuries and using them as collateral in crypto markets presents a significant opportunity to merge the best aspects of traditional finance with the innovation of DeFi. By reducing volatility, deepening liquidity, and attracting institutional capital, tokenized Treasuries could revolutionize both markets, unlocking a new era of hybrid finance.

42415715,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomczi,1729696707,Scroll's Token Declines 32% as Whales Scoop Up Airdrop,"Scroll's SCR token is down by 32% in just over 24 hours following its launch.  Total value locked on the network has declined 24% in the past week as investors vent their frustration about token supply.  The top 10 airdrop recipients received 11.7% of the total drop.  After more than a year of hype and expectation, layer-2 network Scroll's governance token launch is beginning to fall short of expectations after being plagued by token allocation issues.  One day after debuting at $1.40, SCR is now trading 32% lower at $0.94 with its market cap shrinking to below $180 million. The plunge has seen the token drop out of the 250 largest tokens on CoinMarketCap despite Scroll being heralded as the ""turtle that wins the Ethereum scaling race.""  Poor token performance isn't always representative of a failing project ‚Äì a number of recently-released tokens fail to impress during the opening period of price discovery ‚Äì but it's worth noting that total value locked (TVL) on Scroll has fallen by 23% in the past week after hitting a peak of $1 billion, DefiLlama data shows.  Scroll's issues appear to stem from the token allocation and distribution. In the lead up to SCR's release, users expressed their frustration at Scroll's decision to set aside 5.5% of the supply to the Binance Launchpool and just 7% for the initial airdrop. That frustration was compounded this week after it emerged that Scroll's refusal to put an airdrop cap in place meant that a handful of whales scooped up the majority of available tokens.  According to Andrew10Gwei on X, the top 10 wallets will receive 11.7% of the airdrop and the top 100 will receive 34.4%. This typically means that the token will struggle to sustain a price rally as investor demand can't keep up with the pace of selling from whales that received a hefty airdrop.  Scroll ran its airdrop campaign by rewarding early adopters and users with ""marks"" that could eventually be converted into an airdrop. This method has been relatively common in crypto over the past few years and is often referred to as ""points farming.""  But the omission of fixed allocation bands or a maximum cap has spoiled the equilibrium of token supply, it now faces a difficult short-term future as the whales need to be convinced not to sell whilst prospective investors need to believe that it's an asset that has future upside.  Points farming is fickle by nature ‚Äì investors will often use a project to meet the airdrop criteria then move their capital to farm another airdrop on another protocol. While this gives projects an initial boost in activity, it can have a negative long-term impact as there is no incentive to hold the token after an airdrop is distributed .

Analyst Reveals Key Insights Suggesting Major Uptrend Ahead,"A crypto market analyst recently released a study that predicts a big rise in the price of XRP. This study fits with the current excitement in the crypto community, especially since Elon Musk made his first public reference to XRP. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rockets 30% In A Week, Sparking Hype For Uptober Rally In a video that went viral on Crypto Twitter, Musk talked about how valuable cryptocurrencies like XRP are.

Elon Musk Talks About XRP.pic.twitter.com/FFhvsF6PP7 ‚Äî TheCryptoBasic (@thecryptobasic) October 21, 2024 XRP‚Äôs Role In Global Finance It was brought up in the video that Musk was asked if he thought XRP could play a big role in the global financial system, given the SEC‚Äôs focus on regulating the cryptocurrency. His answer was simple, but it worked. He said that coins like XRP challenge centralized control and support personal freedom, but that was not a call to action. Although it did not express outright support, such statements by Musk have given hope to crypto investors because of the influence he has on the market. #XRP MOONSHOT TO $40.00 OVERNIGHT !!! pic.twitter.com/gGc5DBGDoF ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 9, 2024 Crypto analyst Steph‚Äôs technological study fits this increasing buzz. Since 2018, he noted a symmetrical triangular pattern developing on the XRP/USD chart that points to a notable breakout perhaps just ahead. Musk‚Äôs Social Media Impact Currently at the top of this triangle, XRP reflects the 2017 situation that resulted in its spectacular surge and all-time high of $3.31. Investors are eagerly observing since Musk‚Äôs remarks seem to coincide with this pivotal technical turning point. Regulatory hurdles have long been a factor in XRP‚Äôs price suppression, Steph notes especially in view of Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Still, he believes the coin may be set to have a major breakthrough‚Äîjust like it did in 2021 when it outperformed Bitcoin by 460%. Even if Musk doesn‚Äôt explicitly support the token, his mention of it can boost market sentiment because some speculators think the altcoin is currently more affordable than Bitcoin. Upbeat About XRP‚Äôs Future Essentially, Steph is positive about the future of the altcoin but stresses that what is exciting is the developing relationships Ripple has with huge financial institutions. The implications for this are that when CBDCs are going to be more in demand, XRP will be even more important within the global financial system. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Soars: Analyst Predicts 71% Rally In ‚ÄòMeme Super Cycle‚Äô ‚Äì Details More than this, institutional interest in the asset is also depicted through recent registration for XRP-oriented ETFs from Canary Capital and Bitwise. These events with the words of Musk have revived hopes about XRP‚Äôs long-term possibilities again. Nevertheless, Steph cautions even with the good technical and fundamental signals. While he thinks XRP may probably hit $40, he said that a more realistic target range for it would be $5 to $10. Considering the highly volatile and uncertain market, he advised investors to use their judgment properly. Steph underlined the need for strategic and cautious investment in view of the unpredictable character of cryptocurrency markets, even though a new all-time high could be on horizon by the end of 2024.

Jones' comments came in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday while discussing the deteriorating situation of the U.S. debt trajectory. The interview was conducted just a few days after government data showed the annual budget deficit rose by $138B to $1.8T in the fiscal year that ended in September. According to Jones, the ""playbook"" to reducing the country's debt to GDP ratio is to ""inflate your way out."" ""You have a small tax on the consumer, and you run interest rates below inflation and nominal growth above inflation,"" Jones told CNBC. ""All roads lead to inflation. I am long gold. I am long bitcoin. I think commodities are so ridiculously underowned, so I'm long commodities,"" Jones said. ""I think most young people find their inflation hedges via the Nasdaq, that's also been great. I probably have some basket of gold, bitcoin, commodities and Nasdaq, something like that. And I own zero fixed income,"" he added. Jones' comments come at a time when gold prices are sitting at record highs. Spot gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) settled at $2,746.07/ounce on Tuesday, as investors flock to the safe-haven amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and an uncertain U.S. economic and political outlook. For more, see live data for several assets on the Seeking Alpha commodities page. Meanwhile, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been on an upward trend lately, which analysts have attributed to volatility in the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election. Notably, about $560M flowed into 11 spot bitcoin ETFs on Monday, the largest amount since early June, according to data from London-based Farside Investors. Turning to the Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ), the tech-heavy gauge has soared 23.7% YTD, as the artificial intelligence (AI) trade continues to boom. Here are some exchange-traded funds of interest linked to gold and gold miners: ( GLD ), ( IAU ), ( SGOL ), ( OUNZ ), ( BAR ), ( GDX ), ( GDXJ ), ( NUGT ), ( RING ), and ( DUST ). For ETFs linked to bitcoin, see: ( IBIT ), ( ARKB ), ( GBTC ), ( BRRR ), ( BTCO ), ( HODL ), ( BTCW ), ( FBTC ), ( BITB ), and ( EZBC ).

35052520,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649419,1729692051,"XRP Price Could Face Last Major Crash, Warns Crypto Analyst","In a new technical analysis of the XRP price in the weekly chart (XRP/USD), crypto analyst Dark Defender warns of a potential last major crash. The analysis uses the Elliott Wave theory and dives into the historical and projected paths for XRP, marked by critical price levels and wave patterns. Final Crash Ahead For XRP Price? According to Dark Defender, XRP concluded its Wave 1 at a high of $0.9327 in mid July last year, significantly surpassing initial targets set when the price was just $0.28. ‚ÄúThe ones know, know, that we targeted $0.89 and above when XRP was at $0.28. However, XRP closed the Wave 1 at $0.9327. So, we haven‚Äôt decided on that, right? We set the limits and targets and then see it. So, right after the initial target, XRP started consolidating,‚Äù Dark Defender commented. The chart analysis shows that after peaking, the price action found a firm base at $0.3917, a level that was closely approached with a touch at $0.3814, underscoring the accuracy of the predicted support levels based on the Elliott Wave theory. ‚ÄúWe all knew that our lowest level was $0.3917, which we set. Later, XRP almost precisely touched $0.3814.We then underlined that this area was the lowest Fibonacci zone several times,‚Äù the analyst declared. Related Reading: XRP Network Activity Surges As Price Seeks To Break $0.55 Resistance Moving into more recent activity, Dark Defender has placed significant emphasis on the $0.6649 mark, describing it as an ‚Äúextraordinary level‚Äù and ‚Äúthe strongest of all.‚Äù The analyst notes, ‚ÄúAnd as soon as we see XRP above $0.66, a day, a week, a month, then we will see tremendous moves.‚Äù However, the latest weekly Wave indicator provides a red signal, suggesting possible downward pressure. Dark Defender cautions investors, ‚Äúat the moment, the weekly indicator gives us a red signal, which can be false but tells us that, guys, think about the support levels of $0.5286, $0.4850, and the lowest probability of $0.3917 as a double dip.‚Äù Although there is potential for a decline, the likelihood remains low, according to Dark Defender. ‚ÄúCan XRP touch here again!!! Oh God, yes but it is less likely.‚Äù Despite the short-term bearish signal, the monthly wave trend remains green, which typically overrides the weekly indicators, suggesting the red signal could be premature. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts XRP Price Direction For This Week, What To Expect ‚ÄúAlthough the weekly signals red now, the monthly wave trend is green which trumps the weekly. This made me think that the weekly is a fake signal at this stage,‚Äù the analyst explains, reinforcing the potential for continued bullish momentum in the longer term. Remarkably, the wave indicator also gave false signals on the weekly chart during the first wave, which underlines the long-term theory of Dark Defender. He still believes that XRP‚Äôs Wave 3 ‚Äúpossible targets are at $0.88, $5.85 and $18.22 respectively.‚Äù However, before the price can rally this high, there is one last major resistance. ‚ÄúAs long as $0.48 and most importantly $0.3917 is maintained, XRP targets are clear, especially after $0.6649. Please do not underestimate and think what the hell is $0.66? It is the red thin line.We know, and see what is going on in the background. Less people remain on the ship, we see. But I trust myself, Ripple, and XRP. Exciting times are ahead of us,‚Äù he states. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5302.

42415718,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomdFm,1729692000,Bitcoin Startup Satflow Targets 'Mempool Sniping' in New Token-Trading Rival to Magic Eden,"Bitcoin infrastructure project Satflow has introduced a DEX for professional traders focused on the Ordinals and Runes ecosystems.  The aim is to eliminate the practise of mempool sniping, the effects of which may be more acute on Bitcoin than other networks.  Satflow, a Bitcoin infrastructure firm focused on the Ordinals and Runes ecosystems, has introduced a decentralized exchange (DEX) for professional traders ‚Äì positioned as a less-expensive alternative to the popular NFT marketplace Magic Eden.  In a press release shared with CoinDesk, Satflow said that its fees initially will be 0%, claiming they would be a couple percentage points lower than Magic Eden's.  The new DEX's aim is to eliminate the practice of mempool sniping, which is when users exploit the time lag in which a transaction is waiting to be added to a Bitcoin block. Under the blockchain's design, the ""mempool"" is the queue where transactions sit waiting to be added to new blocks by Bitcoin miners.  Snipers essentially hijack these transactions by removing them from the waiting room, then add them back in with their own signature and a higher fee attached, so that the transactions get chosen by Bitcoin miners first for inclusion in the next block.  There is a greater opportunity for this practice on Bitcoin than other blockchains because of the 10-minute window before a transaction is added to a new block and thus confirmed. The issue is further exacerbated in the Ordinals and Runes ecosystems, when new assets may be prone to rapid price swings.  Therefore, developers have turned their attention to purpose-building exchanges to meet this challenge. Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace MagicEden has attempted to tackle this by mandating three transactions: one for the seller, one for the buyer and one to unify them.  Satflow trades also involve three transactions, which make them ""unsnipable in mempool,"" one of the project's founders Robert Clarke told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  ""Both Satflow and other exchanges will still process 'legacy' trades that can be sniped, but we're expecting the market to shift quickly over to secure-purchase and other non-snipable trades,"" he added.  ""Existing DEXs have built their experience that feels more oriented for Etherem or Solana, but trading on Bitcoin is unique in that you need to build from a mempool-first perspective,"" Satflow said in an announcement on Wednesday.  Satflow, which recently raised $7.5 million in seed funding, is aiming its DEX at high-volume traders who are seeking a more efficient experience when dealing with Ordinals or Runes.

42415706,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomcuM,1729691544,Bitcoin Miners Are Pivoting to AI to Survive. Core Scientific Entered the Race Years Ago,"Core Scientific is expanding its AI deal with CoreWeave.  Russell Cann, Core Scientific‚Äôs chief development officer, talked to CoinDesk about the particulars of the bitcoin miner‚Äôs multi-billion dollar infrastructure agreement with CoreWeave.  AI fleets and bitcoin mining operations have very different requirements, Cann said, with AI clusters being much more capital intensive.  Bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) revealed a deal on Tuesday to help cloud-computing firm CoreWeave expand its artificial intelligence capabilities.  It‚Äôs easy to think that Core Scientific is simply jumping on the AI bandwagon with this agreement (which it hopes will generate $8.6 billion in revenue over 12 years) to build 500 megawatts of infrastructure. Mining has gotten brutal following the fourth Bitcoin halving in April (which hammered profits), and other firms ‚Äì such as Hut 8 and HIVE ‚Äì are now dedicating significant resources to AI computation instead of single-mindedly extracting bitcoin {{BTC}}.  The truth, however, is that due to its unique business model ‚Äì a heavy focus on building application-specific infrastructure for data centers ‚Äì Core Scientific was almost always guaranteed to have a leg up on other bitcoin miners with AI.  Not only that, but Core Scientific had a head start. The company entered the AI game in 2019, far ahead of the rest of the industry, and while it briefly entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the crypto market‚Äôs collapse in 2022 before re-emerging at the beginning of 2024, it still has technical know-how.  ""Core Scientific started out as a data center operator primarily providing colocation services rather than for proprietary mining. So it may have a relatively longer history than other public peers in terms of constructing and operating proprietary infrastructure,"" Wolfie Zhao, head of research at mining advising firm BlocksBridge Consulting, told CoinDesk.  ""The investment requirements for purpose built infrastructure and GPUs for AI workloads are so high that capital allocators cannot afford to take operational risks by partnering with inexperienced operators,"" CJ Burnett, chief revenue officer at bitcoin mining marketplace Compass Mining, told CoinDesk. ""A track record of performance and deep industry relationships can create a defensible moat for the first movers in the space.""  Core Scientific‚Äôs second ace in the hole? This multi-billion-dollar deal only marks another step in its fruitful relationship with CoreWeave.  ‚ÄúIt wasn't something that just came out of nowhere,‚Äù Russell Cann, the miner‚Äôs chief development officer, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  ‚ÄúWe were their largest GPU hosting provider,‚Äù he said, referring to graphics processing units, the high-performing computers that form the basis of AI clusters. ‚ÄúWe've had a long-standing relationship with CoreWeave. There's been a lot of trust there. We worked on a lot of engineering pieces together as they developed their GPU cloud business.‚Äù  So it isn‚Äôt so much that Core Scientific is diversifying into AI, but rather that the seven-year-old company ‚Äì one of the biggest mining operations in the world in terms of hashrate, per TheMinerMag data ‚Äì is growing in a way that plays to its core strengths.  Differences between AI fleets and bitcoin mining  The agreement separates responsibilities between Core Scientific and CoreWeave, with the former being in charge of building a data center suited for AI clusters, while the latter ‚Äì which ultimately owns the machines, and the software stack ‚Äì provides high computational services to its clients. Any modification to Core Scientific‚Äôs existing infrastructure is funded by CoreWeave.  ‚ÄúWe build our infrastructure, in most cases, from the substation all the way down to the chip itself that mines bitcoin,‚Äù Cann said, and the same level of detail applies to building the machines dedicated to AI.  There‚Äôs a lot to take into consideration. Data centers for AI fleets and bitcoin mining may look the same from the outside, but once in the building, everything changes, said Cann. That‚Äôs because Core Scientific doesn‚Äôt believe in one-size-fits-all ‚Äì the firm‚Äôs competitive advantage stems from its ability to customize every bit of infrastructure to make it application-specific.  For example, the power infrastructure is completely different for mining and AI applications. If the power goes down in a bitcoin mine, it‚Äôs not the end of the world, because the ability to switch your machines on and off depending on the price of electricity is an essential facet of bitcoin mining, to the point that many firms use that function in a strategic manner.  But AI fleets need constant uptime, and that means implementing expensive power redundancy measures, including batteries, backup generators and uninterruptible power supply, or UPS, systems.  Another example: Whether you‚Äôre mining bitcoin or running an AI cluster, machines must be cooled to avoid overheating ‚Äì but the optimal cooling method will depend on the application, Cann said. Most bitcoin rigs are cooled by fans or by being submerged in a pool of dielectric fluid, which comes at little cost. The GPUs used for AI, on the other hand, require some form of air conditioning, or to pass fluid over the machine‚Äôs silicon chip ‚Äì two methods that consume large amounts of energy. Other differences emerge when you look at the kind of hard drives used for AI fleets compared to bitcoin mining operations, or the amount of fiber and connectivity that is needed for each site.  Big picture: AI sites tend to be much more expensive and less versatile than bitcoin mining operations, which can be plopped in all kinds of remote locations all around the world. That‚Äôs why Core Scientific, as a rule of thumb when examining a new site, will determine whether the economics of it makes sense for AI purposes first, and, if not, look at it from a bitcoin mining perspective.  ‚ÄúIf I built a world-class air-cooled bitcoin mining site, I'm going to spend probably between $500,000 to $750,000 per megawatt,‚Äù Cann said. But that cost climbs up to $10 million to $12 million by megawatt for AI-related GPUs, he said.  That certainly puts the size of the 500-megawatt deal with CoreWeave into perspective. By that measure, it will cost roughly $5 billion to build the infrastructure CoreWeave needs. The project will be big enough that it could power roughly 100,000 homes, according to data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ‚Äì the Lone Star State‚Äôs electrical grid operator. Most of that power will be coming online in 2025 and 2026.  It‚Äôs still just a fraction of Core Scientific‚Äôs total footprint. The firm currently owns 1,600 megawatts worth of heavy electrical infrastructure and has 1,200 megawatts of power purchase agreements.  Lots of experience to draw on  According to Cann, the reason Core Scientific is so good at building application-specific infrastructure is because the firm has a wealth of experience using all kinds of high compute machines.  For example, the company used GPUs to mine ether {{ETH}} back before Ethereum switched its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in 2022. Using similar GPUs, Core Scientific started hosting AI clusters in early 2019, Cann said, way before ChatGPT and chipmaker Nvidia shook the world.  The firm stopped running its unit in November 2022, soon before entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Core Scientific emerged from bankruptcy in January after receiving approval for its restructuring plan.  ‚ÄúA lot of people talk about us pivoting into AI, but we've been doing AI for a long time,‚Äù Cann said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre taking advantage of market conditions and expanding our AI piece back again.‚Äù  And the fast-paced world of bitcoin mining has shaped the team ‚Äì which counts people with decades of experience building traditional data centers ‚Äì in a way that gives it an edge over their competitors who‚Äôve never been involved with bitcoin, Cann said.  ‚ÄúBitcoin is a 24/7, 365 days a year, global market. It's always moving,‚Äù Cann said.  ‚ÄúSome of the traditional guys that don‚Äôt have experience mining bitcoin, they're just going to be a little bit behind, because they have to catch up on that fast iteration,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAI is the only thing I've ever seen that iterates as fast as bitcoin mining.‚Äù",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/23/bitcoin-miners-are-pivoting-to-ai-to-survive-core-scientific-entered-the-race-years-ago,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0515d656b84a1d9a9f62981240d19cf93f7c4002-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415725,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomdQU,1729691344,"Justin Sun Might Be Good for Wrapped Bitcoin, Says New Custodian's Director","Robert Liu, a member of the board of Hong Kong-based BiT Global, spoke to CoinDesk in an interview.  Liu defended Tron founder Justin Sun's role as an advisor to the project, arguing that the blockchain he founded is trusted by holders of tens of billions of Tether's stablecoin, USDT.  The business plan for WBTC is to increase the outstanding amount by five to 10 times what is now, just under $10 billion ‚Äì using a geographically diversified custodial setup that might be more appealing to buyers outside the U.S.  The project is being positioned as a crypto-native alternative to bitcoin exchange-traded funds.  Regarding purportedly more decentralized alternatives to WBTC, he said: ""There's no accountability if something goes wrong. Those people don't even go by their real names, right? They go by all kinds of strange animal names. Nowadays, I know identifying with the animal is quite trendy in the U.S., right? But at least we go by our real names.""  In August, the mere disclosure that Tron founder Justin Sun was involved in the custody operations related to wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) ‚Äì a popular token in decentralized finance ‚Äì was enough to rattle the crypto industry.  At least one major decentralized finance (DeFi) project considered eliminating WBTC completely as a collateral option, and several major crypto players, including the exchange Coinbase, rushed out competing products.  Sun is seen as controversial by some crypto industry analysts, owing to his involvement in various stablecoin projects that turned turbulent, and in other instances where a lack of transparency was cited.  BitGo, the original and longtime custodian of the bitcoin backing WBTC, announced on Aug. 9 that it would distribute control over the project's custody to three entities globally instead of just one ‚Äì as a way of helping to decentralize the operation. According to the release, BiT Global is a global custody platform with regulated operations based in Hong Kong, registered as a Trust and Company Service Provider (TCSP), and is a ""a strategic partnership between BitGo, Justin Sun and the Tron ecosystem.""  WBTC is a token that allows investors to use bitcoin (BTC) on other blockchains, and plays a key role in lending DeFi as collateral, with a $9 billion market capitalization.  BiT Global is now one of three holders of the keys overseeing the bitcoin in custody, project officials have confirmed.  But what if Sun's involvement is a strength rather than a liability?  This argument was made to CoinDesk this week by BiT Global director Robert Liu, in an exclusive interview.  What exactly is Sun's role with the project? And who owns it? We got some clarity, but not total clarity.  This interview that follows has been edited for clarity and brevity.  How did this deal with BitGo come about?  Liu: The conversation started last year. That was shortly after BitGo's deal with Galaxy fell apart. At the time we were already anticipating the bitcoin spot ETF being given the green light at some point. And , the idea came about that WBTC stands out as an alternative play, almost like a shadow play on the virtual side with the spot ETF. The spot bitcoin ETF is basically the wrapper of underlying bitcoin in a financial ETF structure, right? Whereas this WBTC basically is the virtual wrapper of Bitcoin to be utilized in the DeFi project? So that's when BitGo was also looking for potential partners to strengthen the WBTC project after the merger deal with Galaxy fell apart. So we put a company together.  Ok, well let's get to Justin Sun and what his role is. Obviously you were very intentionally transparent in the initial press release about the fact that he was involved. But I don't know if it's been clarified exactly what his role is.  Liu: He really was instrumental in making the initial contact with BitGo happen. Myself, obviously, coming from the tradfi space, I personally don't know BitGo. I know the company, the business model, the significance of WBTC. So just having obviously collaborated with him in the past on some financial transactions. He is instrumental to put together the initial data for myself with BitGo and [BitGo CEO] Mike Belshe. So he plays no other roles than just serving as advisor, strategic advisor, and also helping to basically put together the two teams. There's no reason to hide the importance of Justin, both in terms of his role in the overall industry, and his influence in in particular in Asia, in the crypto space. He sees the opportunity. But he has no management role within Global Trust, which is a licensed fiduciary platform in Hong Kong. He's not an employee. He's not a shareholder. He is not in possession of the keys, which is a focal point in the media, in terms of what it means to have this restructuring, in terms of access to the private keys and how the smart contracts are governed and so on, right? So he has none of those specific, specific roles that some of the unfounded market speculations are suggesting.  To clarify, Robert, you are the CEO of the company?  Liu: I'm actually just director on the board. The CEO, really it's more of operational and technological project. So we have a CEO who's got a very diverse background in custody and DeFi. Maxwell Fu is the CEO.  OK, thank you, Robert. And are you the principal shareholder or majority owner of the company?  I'm not. We have six institutional holders, holding the shares of BitGlobal Trust. I'm certainly financially incentivized. But in terms of shareholding structure, it's all fairly straightforward. BitGo is among one of them.  OK, and who are the others?  Liu: There are six others. We can send you the detailed names at a later stage, like later today or later on.  [EDITOR'S NOTE: We did not receive the names later in the day, but CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds did manage to track down the corporate records from the Hong Kong Companies Registry, showing the names of the institutional shareholders ‚Äì all with the same number of shares held, and listed with the same addresses in the British Virgin Islands ‚Äì where information on directors and beneficial owners is not easy to come by. Asked if Sun has any ownership relationship, direct or indirect, to any of the listed shareholders of BiT Global, a spokesperson told us, ""Justin Sun has no direct or indirect involvement on the cap table.""]  Well OK, so regarding Justin Sun, he is obviously is a pioneer in this space, founded the Tron blockchain, and he's been super successful in a lot of ways. But then a few things have kind of maybe put some question marks in people's heads. Personally, as an editor, we were writing about the Huobi deal, and he said he was an advisor, and he said he didn't own it, and then later he acknowledged he a huge percentage of the tokens, so he basically controlled the project. So it didn't seem like he was being entirely straightforward, and I think stuff like that might be part of the reason for a gap in the trust here from some folks. But so you're saying he does not have any role besides being an advisor to the project. Is that correct?  Liu: Correct, Brad, I wanted to echo your remarks about Justin a little bit right now. Now, I know you are spot on with Justin's propensity to attract certain attention for good or bad reason. And I wanted also to highlight his success with the Tron blockchain, because, I'm not gonna really comment on some of the more subjective media coverage of him. But just very objectively, we all know that Tron blockchain is probably the most successful layer-1 blockchain in terms of providing the most successful RWA project to today, which is the USD stablecoin [including Tether's USDT]. The Tron blockchain has more than 50% of global market share. They have the highest turnover rate. So people have no issue putting more than $60 billion of the stablecoin assets circulating on Tron blockchain. Nobody questioned that, right? I see people try, but then you didn't go anywhere, right? So then, in terms of Huobi, you know, Huobi is a very touchy feeling project. Because we all know the history in China. It's highly sensitive. This is not something I personally want to comment on, right? There was a well covered incident of a hack last year. OK, if you Google it, anyone can find that. And personally, what I can tell you is, if not for Justin, the users would be in big trouble, right? So he basically is the reason why the users still feel safe and comfortable. So I think, just purely from my observation of facts, the market should give him the benefit of doubt.  Interesting. I haven't seen that point made anywhere, but I think it's a smart one to make. OK, well, let's just talk about ‚Äì and this changed right from the initial press release: BiT Global was going to have two of the keys, and then they changed the structure so they only have one of the keys. Is that correct?  Liu: The plan was to continue to use BitGo U.S. as the hot wallet validation key, they hold that one right? So then BiT Global Trust, being the custodian, takes two keys, the main key and then the backup key. And that's actually, almost, mandatory. As a licensed custodian of public assets, we have to demonstrate, and seriously, we have to demonstrate we are in the majority control of the vault, right? Because otherwise we are not a fiduciary. And what if something happens? Whose fault is it? Whoever has two keys, will be at fault, right? So, so that's for that reason we have to have two keys, compared with, say in the past, before the deal, there are three keys, always BitGo, right? So then what happens, we all know what happened. All kinds of chatter, speculations, FUD, right? And then we had a community call. It was actually very, very helpful that call. A lot of people signed up. Some of the OG's, who originated the WBTC idea. They hosted the call. They made a bargain plea. Basically, they say, Look it's too dramatic a change. We have no prior information about this. We don't know who is BiT Global Trust. We don't feel comfortable, right?  We thought about it, and then BitGo proposed that we probably should think about it, because at that time, they offered a very helpful alternative. At the time during much of the time of the restructuring process, right, BitGo did not yet have a license in Asia. They were looking to set up a footprint in Asia. But it was the same month of the announcement, when BitGo Singapore officially gained a license from MAS in Singapore. So that's what made it possible for us to say, look, OK, so we cannot just give the key to a third party, because one of the community members mentioned that, can we vote credible community members, to hold the key? We're like, it cannot be, It would be a breach of our fiduciary, and we're licensed, right? So BitGo volunteered to use BitGo Singapore, newly licensed by MAS. So that this is truly a three-party, all licensed entities, to collectively hold three different keys, right? So now we hold the main key for the wrapping and unwrapping, BitGo validates it, and the backup key sits in a safe location under the custodian of BitGo Singapore.  Alright, and so that arrangement has been approved by the Hong Kong regulator?  Liu: Well, that's actually within our discretion, and we do have agreement to validate the arrangement by referencing the MAS license, because just like the banks, the banks can put some of their safe deposit in the safe safe box in a licensed security company as well. So something like that was arranged.  Well let's just talk about the business a little bit. Why is this business attractive? Because, looking at some of the dashboards, the number of BTC that are wrapped has kind of flattened out, right? And it's widely reported that the revenue comes from the wrapping and the unwrapping. But if you're stable, there's no revenue. So what's the opportunity?  Liu: That was actually the catalyst for BitGo to be willing to talk with someone like us. OK? You're spot on. Right now, while bitcoin is already surpassed the previous peak in '21, WBTC is only 50% of where it used to be, right? And then we all know some of the major financial players, like BlackRock. They have gone all in with their spot ETF. So if the ETF offers this type of attraction to the biggest names in the traditional space, it's a virtual equivalent, WBTC, to us. We want it to grow it. We wanted to not only help it to go back to the previous peak. We want it to go, make it 10 times, if not even a lot more than the current $10 billion, right? That's number one. Number two, based on our communication within our channel, there are a couple of reasons why WBTC has not been growing. One of the reasons being, the U.S. regulatory contact is not particularly conducive. And you may be aware that nearly 100% of the WBTC comes from international platforms. Okay, so WBTC doesn't deal with end users directly. They deal with merchants. And virtually 100% of merchants are offshore entities, and they engage offshore users to meet WBTC. But think about it, personally, I don't see reason for international ‚Äì the whales, right? To put their WBTC in the vault sitting somewhere in the middle of the U.S., against a regulatory environment that we all know, up until these days, maybe seems to change next year, but so far has not been the case, right? So that's one of the major holdbacks of WBTC growth potential.  Have you talked about potentially changing that revenue model to where, instead of just fees from going in and out, there might be some kind of a yield so you could get, like, some recurring revenue?  Liu: We're not thinking of any new revenue model until we grow this thing to at least five to 10 times, OK, and then we would definitely not want to have any exposure to fees that is coming from the circulation side. We are the custodian, and the reason institutions don't cost certain platforms in a crypto space is, you mix custody with commercial circulation of your assets. We wanted to focus solely on the custodian side. For now our objective is to make it secure, and regulatory compliant, so that the users would feel confident to come back and grow it.  What do you think about all the competition coming into the space, including from some competitors that say they're more decentralized?  We have the unique competitive advantage here on a couple fronts. Number one, we have a truly diversified jurisdictional and geographic control of the vault and private key, right? No one can compete with that, and that's very important, until we have a harmonized global regulation. Without that, this is the foolproof setup. There's no single point of failure. It's virtually impossible for three different jurisdictions to collude if they don't like it. So that's number one. Number two, we strike the right balance between centralized and decentralized. The centralized element is absolutely necessary if you want to grow an important strategic asset like wrapped bitcoin, if you want to grow by scale, you have to have a trusted party to hold billions of multi billions, tens of billions of Bitcoin, right? You cannot. I'm personally not aware of any decentralized project that can just take away your bitcoin and say, trust me, it's always there, the minute you want it, it's always there. I am personally not aware of anything like that. On the decentralized front, they say, trust me, right? And just leave your bitcoin with us, and there's no accountability if something goes wrong. Those people don't even go by their real names, right? They go by all kinds of strange animal names. Nowadays, I know identifying with the animal is quite trendy in the U.S., right? But at least we go by our real names. And then on the centralized side, compared with [Coinbase's] cBTC, we're not subject to a constant subpoena by some government regulator, like in the case of Coinbase, right? They will get the subpoena on any given time in relation to any assets, any clients who onboard with CBTC, right? We don't have that in Hong Kong, in Singapore. The regulation is very different, very clear cut, very different, right?",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/10/23/justin-sun-might-be-good-for-wrapped-bitcoin-says-new-custodians-director,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c896cd29508de78a9d0c87db6340df8b9ec8131a-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35050945,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649325,1729688449,Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top?,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Profitability Index is at 202% right now. Here‚Äôs how this compares with past bull runs of the asset. Bitcoin Average Profitability Index Has Been Rising Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr. discussed the latest trend in the Average Profitability Index of Bitcoin. The ‚ÄúAverage Profitability Index‚Äù is an on-chain indicator that tells us about how the spot price of the asset compares against its realized price. Related Reading: Ethereum Leverage Ratio Reaches Extreme Levels, What It Means The ‚Äúrealized price‚Äù here is a measure of the cost basis of the average investor or address on the Bitcoin network. The Average Profitability Index is calculated as a percentage, with the 100% mark corresponding to the spot price being equal to the realized price. When the value of this indicator is greater than 100%, it means the asset is currently trading above the cost basis of the average investor, so the overall market could be assumed to be in a state of profit. On the other hand, it being under this cutoff suggests the holders as a whole are carrying their coins at a net unrealized loss. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Average Profitability Index over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Average Profitability Index has been above 100% since last year, which suggests the investors as a whole have been enjoying profits. The indicator‚Äôs value had spiked to particularly high values earlier in this year when the rally towards the new all-time high (ATH) had occurred. With the latest recovery run that the coin has seen, the indicator has been picking up once again, although it‚Äôs still a notable distance away from the level seen during the ATH. At present, the BTC Average Profitability Index is floating around 202%, which implies the spot price is double that of the realized price. Historically, the indicator reaching extreme levels has generally led to tops for the asset. This is because the investors‚Äô temptation to participate in profit-taking increases the larger their gains. ‚ÄúWhen the index rises above 300%, investors are likely to start taking profits actively,‚Äù notes the analyst. Related Reading: Bitcoin Active Addresses Finally Growing Again: Bullish Sign? The chart shows that the last two times that the Bitcoin Average Profitability Index surpassed this 300% mark was during the heights of the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. Thus, according to this historical pattern, Bitcoin‚Äôs current bullish period may not end until the indicator enters the zone above 300%. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,400, up 1% over the last seven days.

42415707,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomcrg,1729687166,Peter Todd Says Even Reports of His 'Going Into Hiding' Are Exaggerated,"Wired reported that Peter Todd went into hiding due to an influx of financial requests and potential threats from those believing he possesses Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's many-billion-dollar fortune, highlighting the real-world dangers of such public allegations.  Todd tweeted, however, that Wired's claim is ""exaggerated,"" offering as proof his appearance this week at a conference.  A recent documentary by Cullen Hoback suggested Todd might be Nakamoto (something Todd denied).  Peter Todd, the Bitcoin developer alleged to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the network's pseudonymous creator in the hyped but panned HBO documentary, ""Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery,"" has ""gone into hiding,"" Wired reported Tuesday.  Todd, who is quoted in the piece, called its central claim ""exaggerated"" in a post on X Wednesday, which quote-tweeted a picture of him speaking at an Atlanta conference earlier that day.  Todd was fingered as Nakamoto in the documentary shot by Cullen Hoback, who previously identified the face behind the QAnon conspiracy. Todd, however, denied being Nakamoto in an email to CoinDesk.  Hoback's supposed evidence for Todd, a Canadian, being Nakamoto was his interest in cryptography from a young age, his relationship with Adam Back (who actually emailed Nakamoto), his technical ability and Nakamoto's use of British/Canadian spellings.  The documentary provided its strongest clue through a 2010 public forum exchange where Todd seemed (to Hoback) to inadvertently reply to a post as himself instead of the mysterious Bitcoin creator, suggesting a potential slip-up. Hoback posited this as evidence that Todd might be Nakamoto, although the documentary stopped short of making a definitive claim.  The Bitcoin community has largely brushed off Hoback's findings. Hoback, however, told Wired he remains confident that Todd is indeed Nakamoto.  But the allegations have a serious real-world impact.  Todd told Wired that his email has become inundated with requests for financial help ‚Äì but there's a threat of ""continued harassment by crazy people.""  Personal safety is a concern for Todd because criminals might believe he is Nakamoto: Wallets belonging to Nakamoto hold over 1 million BTC, worth more than $67 billion at recent prices. That puts the unknown persona on a list of the 25 wealthiest people in the world.  ""Falsely claiming that ordinary people of ordinary wealth are extraordinarily rich exposes them to threats like robbery and kidnapping,"" Todd told Wired. ""Not only is the question dumb, it's dangerous. Satoshi obviously didn't want to be found, for good reasons, and no one should help people trying to find Satoshi.""  UPDATE (Oct 23, 2024, 22:16 UTC): Updates throughout to reflect that Todd is still speaking at conferences and called the Wired headline ""exaggerated.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/23/peter-todd-bitcoin-developer-named-as-satoshi-nakamoto-in-hbo-documentary-goes-into-hiding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ae0b5fe6c1e8ef20d77cfc1443c3fba9b5c5c14-1592x896.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,055.12 -1.52%  Bitcoin (BTC): $66,466.59 -1.27%  Ether (ETH): $2,582.91 -1.91%  S&P 500: 5,851.20 -0.05%  Gold: $2,751.91 +1.14%  Nikkei 225: 38,104.86 -0.8%  Top Stories  Bitcoin slid below $67,000, prompting a broad decline across the major cryptocurrencies. BTC dropped under $66,500 during the late European morning, around 1.3% lower in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, has fallen just over 1.5%. Bitcoin ETFs snapped a seven-day winning streak on Tuesday, losing nearly $80 million. DOGE led the losses among major tokens, falling 3.8%, while ETH and XRP both lost around 1.5%. DOGE had led gains in the previous seven days following a recent endorsement by Elon Musk.  Observers have pointed out that a slowing of stablecoin issuance is among the causes of the crypto market's progress being continually halted. Bitcoin nudged above the $69,000 mark but failed to sustain its upward movement subsequently. Stablecoin liquidity and growth are closely related to higher bitcoin and crypto prices. ‚ÄúStablecoin volume has not increased since late September, setting up a potential pause in the growth of the broader cryptocurrency market, as stablecoins are often seen as liquidity for quick purchases of coins of interest. The previous growth momentum was from August to September, when the overall crypto market capitalization pushed off the bottom,‚Äù Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk in an email.  Bitcoin may cross previous highs regardless of which candidate becomes the U.S. president, some traders say. Donald Trump has been perceived as the more pro-crypto candidate and therefore it has been assumed a Republican victory would be the more beneficial outcome for BTC. However, some say the asset is poised to go higher either way. ‚ÄúBoth Presidential candidates have adopted pro-crypto stances to appeal to voters, but it's tough to say if any of their promises will come to pass,‚Äù Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at crypto exchange BTSE, told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúHowever, It is clear that the market is responding positively to the upcoming change in administration and policies - whether it's Harris or Trump, traders and investors think any sort of change will be good.‚Äù  Chart of the Day  Cumulative trading volume on Uniswap, the largest Ethereum-based decentralized exchange, has crossed the $2 trillion mark.  ""Uniswap's success highlights its role in decentralized trading and its presence across multiple chains. Its strong expansion has helped the DEX sector gain ground against centralized counterparts, with the market share of DEXs rising, for example, from 3.8% in January 2021 to 14.1% currently,"" Tagus Capital said.

The cryptocurrency broke from a 1-month structure, fueling a bearish sentiment among market watchers, who foresee further downside for the token. Related Reading: Analyst Says Fantom (FTM) Downtrend Is Over, Is $1 The Next Stop? SUI Loses Key Support Zone SUI has been on a downtrend this week, losing the recently gained levels alongside most of the market. The cryptocurrency saw a 5.3% drop in the last 24 hours, which has worried some investors and crypto analysts. The token registered one of the best performances during Q3, leading the market as one of the few altcoins registering green numbers in most timeframes. SUI started the month by recording a 15% weekly surge, which fueled its rally toward its new all-time high (ATH). Additionally, the token jumped 25% from its monthly opening, shooting past the $2 barrier to reach a new ETH of $2.35. However, its bullish rally was overshadowed by insider selling allegations on October 13. Market expert LightCrypto alleged that SUI‚Äôs performance would be affected by insiders‚Äô continuous selling, who had unloaded $400 million in SUI tokens. Following the allegations, the cryptocurrency faced a 15% daily correction but remained above the crucial $2 support level. Since then, the cryptocurrency has moved sideways, hovering between the $2-$2.15 price range until today. On Tuesday morning, SUI lost the $2 support, plunging 6.5% toward the $1.87 mark before recovering the $1.90 zone. The token‚Äôs dip represented a 13% decline from its price seven days ago and an 18.4% drop from its ATH. Is A 30% Pullback Looming? Following SUI‚Äôs recent price action, some crypto analysts revealed that another pullback seems to be looming. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa weighed in on the markets‚Äô current performance, as it slowed down after Bitcoin‚Äôs surge to $69,000 on Sunday. Sherpa considers the market‚Äôs rally momentarily paused, highlighting that ‚Äúmost alts are either pulling back or consolidating.‚Äù To him, the tokens that recorded a strong run in September, including Bittensor (TAO) and SUI, have ‚Äúa bit more pullback to go‚Äù before resuming their rally. The analyst forecasted a 25% to 30% correction toward the $1.4 support zone or lower, detailing that there will probably be ‚Äúplenty of bounces‚Äù along the way. Similarly, crypto investor Doji noted that the cryptocurrency broke ‚Äúa massive 1-month stricture to the downside.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Activity Soars After 4-Month Slump‚ÄîWould A 72% Rally Follow? The investor revealed that the token dropped below the lower trendline of a broadening wedge pattern on its 1-month chart. Doji suggested that SUI will retest the pattern before dropping lower toward the lower liquidity spot at $1.4. Nonetheless, he expects ‚Äúto see the middle of the macro range at some point.‚Äù Despite the drop, SUI registers a 30.7% surge in the monthly timeframe, trading at $1.92 at the time of writing.

The charges were dropped to allow him to seek medical treatment abroad, another report said.  The government's charges against Binance itself remain.  Nigeria's government has withdrawn the money laundering charges against Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan days after a court denied him bail, local news outlet Punch reported first on Wednesday.  ""People are on the way to give the order"" to the Kuje prison and then he should be released ""immediately,"" Gambaryan's lawyer Mark Mordi told CoinDesk on the phone. He did not share any other details about when Gambaryan is expected to leave the country.  Reuters reported that the government did so to allow Gambaryan to seek medical treatment abroad, citing the ""government's lawyer"" who also said the Nigeria would continue the money laundering case against Binance without Gambaryan.  Binance is facing a tax-evasion trial with Nigeria demanding $10 billion in penalties for enabling some $26 billion of untraceable funds which purportedly led to the Nigerian naira weakening to record lows against the dollar.  Gambaryan, Binance's head of financial crime compliance, has been detained in Nigeria since February, when he came to the nation at the invitation of the government to discuss issues related to the company. He had come with Nadeem Anjarwalla, Binance's regional manager for Africa, who escaped detention in March.  During his time in prison Gambaryan, a U.S. citizen, developed malaria, pneumonia and tonsillitis.But he was also suffering from complications tied to a herniated disc in his back which left him in need of a wheelchair ‚Äì though in a video from his last court appearance, Gambaryan did not have a wheelchair and instead had to struggle on a single crutch, CoinDesk reported earlier.  Pressure had been mounting on the Nigerian authorities given Gambaryan's ill-health. Gambaryan's wife, Yuki Gambaryan illustrated the family's ordeal through a recent podcast and a video, besides other frequent efforts to bring attention to the case.  During one of the earlier hearings, Mordi, told the court that former Internal Revenue Service agent needed surgery since July 18. Binance CEO Richard Teng and members of the U.S. Congress had urged Nigeria and U.S. authorities to help bring him back to the U.S.  The Gambaryan family, Binance and Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.

35049309,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24371,1729684533,Bitcoin will lead the future of capital markets,"By Jesse Knutson, Head of Operations, Bitfinex Securities As financial institutions continue to ramp up their tokenization efforts, many ‚Äì including Blackrock ‚Äì have been quick to assume that Ethereum will dominate this space. However, I think that Bitcoin, with its superior security model and emerging programmability, is actually poised to become the foundation for the next generation of capital markets. It‚Äôs true that Ethereum has taken an early lead in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. According to RWA.xyz the total value of RWA on Ethereum stands at $2 billion (excluding stablecoins) with Stellar in second place at just $420 million. But early leads don‚Äôt always last. In recent years, Bitcoin ‚Äì the first and probably best-known blockchain ‚Äì has seen breathtaking growth of its layer 2 ecosystem, which is delivering the secure and scalable programmability that financial institutions need to leverage the benefits of tokenization. The Liquid Network ‚Äì a Bitcoin side-chain enabling the fast, confidential settlement, and issuance of digital assets ‚Äì is one example. Its total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $1.7 billion, up from $400 million in 2022. With the additional functionality we‚Äôre now seeing and its top-grade security, Bitcoin is beginning its ascent as the ecosystem of choice for financial institutions looking to tokenize assets. In Latin America, close to $1B of promissory notes have been issued on the Liquid Network. Last quarter, the Blockstream Mining Note‚Äîa security token that raised almost $50M over eight tranches‚Äîexecuted the largest-ever RWA payout, returning more than 1,200 BTC to investors. There are more high-profile issuances in the pipeline. El Salvador‚Äôs government plans to issue its ‚Äòvolcano token‚Äô on the Liquid Network, which will mark the first time sovereign debt has been tokenized anywhere in the world. Combining security and programmability Bitcoin‚Äôs architecture arguably makes it the natural ecosystem for tokenizing real world assets, even if today‚Äôs on-chain activity tells a different story. Bitcoin utilizes the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, which represents the individual units of Bitcoin available for future transactions, ensuring that each piece of Bitcoin is used only once. UTXO offers enhanced protection against double-spending, allows for parallel transaction processing, and improves privacy by using new addresses for each transaction. The UTXO model also simplifies transaction validation, supports advanced features like multi-signature policies without complex smart contracts, and reduces the risk of front-running. In our view, therefore, these characteristics make the UTXO model particularly well-suited for financial applications that prioritize security, scalability, and transaction integrity over complex programmability. It‚Äôs unarguable today that the dominant alternative to UTXO is the account model, commonly controlled by Ethereum smart contracts. But it is also true that the complexity of smart contracts can increase the potential for coding errors and vulnerabilities. Whilst rare, such errors can lead to security breaches, fund losses, or unintended behavior in tokenized securities. Bitcoin has a much higher degree of regulatory clarity than other tokenization ecosystems, virtually all of which have had more complex interactions with regulators and have an ongoing overhang of potentially being classified as unregistered securities. Bitcoin‚Äôs classification as a commodity makes it a cleaner and safer choice for issuers and platforms involved in tokenizing securities and real-world assets. Added together, we see that the ingredients are there for Bitcoin to play a more prominent role in asset tokenization. With side chains such as Liquid Network, Bitcoin balances the need for network security with the programmability and privacy functions required for asset tokenization. The recent growth of Bitcoin as a tokenization ecosystem means that more people are taking notice of it. After all, Bitcoin is not just a store of value ‚Äì but a network that can power the future of our digital capital markets. Author bio: Jesse Knutson is the Head of Operations at Bitfinex Securities, where he is responsible for expanding the platform‚Äôs issuance pipeline, overseeing distribution, and building its user base while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. Prior to this role, Knutson served as Vice President of Financial Products at Blockstream, and held roles at prominent investment banks, including Macquarie Group and Barclays.

Bitcoin has been redistributed into several wallets, with the largest holding between $121 million and $142 million in BTC.  Tesla continues to hold its bitcoin stash, having recently moved coins to new wallets in a move that sparked fears of liquidation, on-chain intelligence Arkham said in a Wednesday post.  The Elon Musk-owned company shifted nearly its entire stash of 11509 BTC, worth $776 million, to new wallets last week, leading to short-term price volatility and fears of forthcoming selling pressure.  But those wallets continue to hold that BTC and haven't sent any to crypto exchanges as of Wednesday, which is usually a sign of intention to liquidate holdings.  ""We believe that the Tesla wallet movements that we reported on last week were wallet rotations with the Bitcoin still owned by Tesla,"" Arkham said on X. ""The Bitcoin has been split between 7 wallets holding 1100 and 2200 BTC. All holding wallets received test transactions, and all but one hold a round number of BTC.""  The three biggest wallets hold $142 million, $128 million and $121 million in BTC individually, while the smallest holds $74 million.  ""Some have speculated that this is a movement to a custodian, for example to secure a loan against the BTC,"" Arkham added in its post.  A CoinDesk analysis noted that the reasons for bitcoin movements include wallet management, internal audits, restructuring of funds, and consolidation of UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs).  Tesla is yet to publicly comment on its decision to move bitcoin.

The 3.9% jump in difficulty becomes the 13th positive adjustment for 2024.  Once the 365-SMA total miner revenue is claimed, this typically coincides with bull runs in bitcoin.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} mining difficulty hit an all-time high of 95.67 terahashes (T), rising by 3.9%, on Tuesday, Glassnode data shows.  Mining difficulty measures how hard it is to mine a new block on Bitcoin. So far, in 2024, there have been 22 difficulty adjustments, with 13 being positive. As a result, the difficulty has jumped from 72T to 92T, a 27% increase, year-to-date.  The network automatically adjusts every 2,016 blocks, which is approximately every two weeks, to ensure that blocks on average are mined every 10 minutes.  Read more: Mining New Bitcoin Is More Difficult Than Ever. Here's How it Could Impact BTC Prices  The surge in mining difficulty has coincided with record hashrate, which also made all-time highs of over 700 exahashes per second (EH/s). Hashrate is the combined computational power to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain.  As difficulty increases, the mining industry faces further pressure as it becomes harder to generate profits. Therefore, operational costs increase as more computational power is needed to invest in more efficient mining equipment.  Weak miners being purged  Part of the downward pressure on bitcoin, since the April halving, has come from unprofitable miners selling holdings. These miners, mainly small private miners, couldn't sustain themselves due to higher costs. After the halving, these miners started to unplug from the network leading to a 15% decrease in hashrate or started selling bitcoin in order to fund operating costs.  Looking at Glassnode data, we see that miner balances dropped this year as weaker miners knew the halving was approaching and were trying to fund operations to get ahead of the game.  From November 2023 to July 2024, we saw over 30,000 bitcoin leave miner wallets, one of the longest distribution periods from miners on record. However, we can now observe that since July, miner balances have been relatively flat and have shown signs of accumulation, telling us remaining miners on average can handle the new environment.  The mining industry will continue to consolidate into stronger hands, with public miners controlling a record share of almost 30%.  Bitcoin bull run commencing soon  Bitcoin bull runs and surging miner revenue coincide; as price increases, so does mining revenue. Glassnode data shows that on a 7-day moving average (7-DMA), the total dollar mining revenue is over $35 million, an increase of over $10 million since the September low.  Since the halving in April, the mining revenue has been below the 365-simple moving average (SMA), currently priced at $40 million. Historically, once the total miner revenue climbs above the 365-SMA, this coincides with a bitcoin bull run, which has been seen historically.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/23/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-hits-all-time-high-as-mining-revenue-rises-signals-upcoming-bull-run,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42925863247c6e8d52245060a23917afd3be7f60-1800x1013.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Historically, when the market cap grows faster than the realized cap, it often signals the beginning of selling pressure, leading to bear markets. Conversely, when the market cap declines while the realized cap holds steady or rises, Bitcoin tends to find its price bottom, indicating potential buying opportunities. Crazzyblockk‚Äôs analysis parallels Bitcoin‚Äôs current market situation and behavior during the 2021 boom. During that period, rapid market cap growth led to significant selling pressure, eventually correcting prices. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is currently in a similar position. While the market cap has seen a notable increase, the realized cap continues to rise, indicating the possibility of another major price correction on the horizon. The analyst‚Äôs study also points out that sustained growth in the realized cap, without corresponding support from the market cap, tends to trigger corrections as investors realize their profits. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in the current market environment, where Bitcoin‚Äôs price has surged in recent months but faces challenges in maintaining its upward trajectory. Crazzyblockk warns that a correction may be inevitable if Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap cannot sustain its current levels. Bitcoin Market Performance Meanwhile, Bitcoin appears to be seeing a cooling-off in the positive price performance seen earlier in recent weeks. So far, the asset has increased by nearly 10% in the past 14 days, reclaiming major highs and even approaching the $70,000 price mark with a high of $69,227 seen yesterday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Activity Soars After 4-Month Slump‚ÄîWould A 72% Rally Follow? However, the past-day performance of Bitcoin suggests a cool-off of this price increase. Over this period, Bitcoin had fallen below $67,000 with a current trading price of $66,980. Regardless of this price correction, some analysts remain bullish. Particularly, a renowned crypto analyst known as Moustache on X has recently highlighted in a recent post that ‚ÄúBitcoin has broken out of a falling channel that has been in place for over 7 months.‚Äù The analyst added that this price action is ‚Äúreminiscent‚Äù of 2020 before the rally. Commenting on the ongoing decline in BTC, the analyst said: ‚ÄúAre bears celebrating a retest? They will be surprised soon.

42415719,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomdIS,1729677725,Why Partisia‚Äôs Blockchain May Be Uniquely Placed to Solve the Data Privacy Issue,"The ‚Äúunparalleled‚Äù nature of Partisia Blockchain‚Äôs ‚Äúprovenance and depth of experience‚Äù makes it uniquely placed to solve the problem of data privacy in public blockchains, Adrienne Youngman, CEO of Partisia Blockchain Foundation told CoinDesk in an interview on Tuesday.  Privacy has been a weakness for public blockchains for years causing enterprises and institutions to be reluctant in using the technology to solve real world problems because it reveals sensitive data. Earlier this year, crypto analytics platform Arkham‚Äôs CEO Miguel Morel said ‚ÄúPublicly available blockchains are probably the worst possible way of keeping one's private information private.‚Äù  Partisia says it offers ‚Äúcomplete data privacy‚Äù as the ‚Äúindustry‚Äôs most secure,‚Äù interoperable token and data bridge using advanced multiparty computation (MPC) to bring privacy to public blockchains, helping anyone trying to implement complex use cases affecting the average person. But what made Partisia uniquely positioned to offer this solution when similar service providers such as Fireblocks, Zama.ai and Chainlink are visible competitors.  Youngman and Partisia‚Äôs Chief Product Officer Mark Bundgaard said its depth of experience, a result of its origins which go back 36 years makes it unique. In 1988, Danish cryptographer Ivan Damg√•rd co-wrote the first paper on multiparty computation (MPC) while pursuing his PHD studies in Aarhus University.  He would also co-invent the Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd construction, which is used in influential cryptographic hash functions. By the time of the 2008 financial crisis, Damg√•rd was a full professor at the university and had founded Partisia, a Denmark based tech group. Partisia applied MPC to solutions for the Danish and Norwegian governments, and multinational corporations, before combining it with blockchain for private deployments.  ‚ÄúPartisia was founded to tackle a critical 'real world' challenge: enabling collaboration on sensitive data without compromising privacy,‚Äù Youngman said. ‚ÄúOur blockchain draws on decades of cryptographic expertise from pioneers like Ivan Damg√•rd allowing us to build solutions that not only overcome barriers to real-world adoption but also create entirely new business models, giving individuals and enterprises unprecedented control over their data.‚Äù  Youngman said Partisia blockchain has a proven track record of over 16 years, including with the Danish health authorities to use patients‚Äô data without revealing their identity. It has also collaborated with global leaders like Bosch and humanitarian institutions like the Red Cross, with whom they are working to make aid-distribution in conflict zones more efficient and safe.  MPC is a cryptographic technique secures secrets by sharing them among multiple parties ensuring that no single party has complete control over the wallet, increasing security.

42415717,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomdD6,1729677600,"Who's Afraid of Gary Gensler? Not Don Wilson, the Trader Who Beat the Regulator Once Before","In an interview with CoinDesk, Don Wilson slams the SEC's crypto crackdown, drawing parallels to his past victory over the CFTC, another Gary Gensler-led regulatory agency  The SEC's stance toward crypto ""reminds me of 'Atlas Shrugged,'"" Wilson said. ""[If] everybody is breaking the law, they get to selectively harass whoever they want to.""  Wilson thinks the SEC's lack of clarity for crypto companies is intentional, not accidental.  Don Wilson is feeling d√©j√† vu.  This month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Cumberland DRW, a division of DRW, the Chicago-based trading giant Wilson founded and runs. The markets regulator accused the company of trading at least $2 billion of cryptocurrencies including Solana's SOL and Polygon's POL (formerly MATIC) without first getting permission. The case hinges on the SEC deeming those assets securities, a designation that imposes all sorts of requirements on traders like DRW.  It's not DRW's first tangle with a regulator. In fact, it's not even DRW's first tangle with Gary Gensler, the SEC's chairman.  Back in 2013, when Gensler ran the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the agency filed suit against DRW and Wilson himself, claiming that they manipulated the market for an obscure interest-rate swap. Wilson and his firm denied any wrongdoing ‚Äì they had, they argued, simply discovered a lucrative arbitrage opportunity their competitors overlooked.  They fought the CFTC and won ‚Äì big time.  The judge in the case, District Judge Richard Sullivan of the Southern District of New York (now a judge in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit) emphatically sided with Wilson after a four-day bench trial, slapping down the CFTC's suit in a scathing 2018 dismissal. He called the CFTC's arguments ""absurd.""  Wilson recalls that ruling fondly.  'Earth is flat'  In an interview with CoinDesk on Friday, Wilson said his favorite lines in the dismissal were Sullivan's quip that ""it is not illegal to be smarter than your counterparty in a swap transaction"" and the judge's assertion that ""it is only the CFTC's Enforcement Division that has persisted in its cry of market manipulation, based on little more than an 'Earth is flat'-style conviction.""  Gensler had long since left the CFTC by the time Sullivan smacked down the regulator's case. But he was there to launch it.  ""It seemed to us that what the CFTC was trying to do was expand the definition of manipulation,"" Wilson said.  That line probably sounds uncomfortably familiar to crypto insiders.  Under Gensler's leadership, the SEC has taken steps, both official and unofficial, to expand its authority over crypto. In February, it broadened the definition of a securities ""dealer"" to capture a large swath of the crypto market, which fits with Genser's often-repeated belief that ""the vast majority"" of crypto tokens are securities and thus deserve SEC oversight.  Read more: Gary Gensler: The Crypto Lightning Rod Who Runs the SEC  Gensler has said over and over that crypto businesses simply need to ""come in and register,"" and they'll be able to trade crypto without issue. The Oct. 10 lawsuit against DRW says: ""Cumberland bought and sold, for its own accounts as part of its regular business, at least $2 billion worth of crypto assets that were offered and sold as securities. In doing so, Cumberland acted as a securities dealer but failed to register as a securities dealer with the Commission.""  Wilson sees it very differently.  ""We set up a broker-dealer and tried to register it to trade crypto assets,"" Wilson said in the interview. ""The markets division of the SEC said, 'If you register, the only ones you could trade are ETH and bitcoin.' The enforcement arm said, 'You failed to register.' Obviously, those two things are inconsistent.""  The SEC did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  Bringing 'Atlas Shrugged' to life?  Kevin Haeberle, a professor of corporate law and securities law at U.C. Irvine School of Law, said that some heads of regulatory agencies are simply ""more aggressive"" than others.  ""When those individuals find themselves limited in what they can do in terms of rule-making, they often turn to regulation by enforcement,"" Haeberle said. ""The SEC has a history of using the broker-dealer definition in a broad manner in order to ensure that customer-protection laws apply in a situation where the SEC would like them to apply ‚Äì even where it isn't clear that the entities at issue are in fact acting as broker-dealers.""  To Wilson, there are many similarities between the SEC's enforcement actions under Gensler and the enforcement action he faced from the Gensler-led CFTC.  He has a theory about why. In Wilson's view, the lack of regulatory clarity from the SEC is a feature, not a bug, of Gensler's leadership at both agencies. Without establishing clear rules or guidance, and demurring when asked whether a given token might be a security, the SEC preserves its ability to selectively prosecute, Wilson said.  ""This dynamic put the SEC in a position where they could say everyone is breaking the rule, and we're just going to go after whoever we want to. [It] reminds me of 'Atlas Shrugged,'"" Wilson said. ""[If] everybody is breaking the law, they get to selectively harass whoever they want to.""  Wilson's theory is not outside the realm of possibility. James Fanto, a professor of Law at Brooklyn Law School and co-director of the school's Center for the Study of Business Law and Regulation, told CoinDesk it's ""absolutely"" possible that Gensler's SEC is being purposely vague in order to preserve its power.  ""That's sort of the typical enforcement approach,"" Fanto said. ""They don't gain from being crystal clear on things, especially in a new area.""  And what does the SEC stand to gain from its opacity towards crypto? Fanto said it could be a few things.  ""Some of it's money, some of it's just to get the publicity and attention,"" Fanto said. ""Probably some of it is just this space that's not regulated, and 'Someone's got to do it, [so] we're going to do it.' But this is an SEC, under [the Biden] Administration, that has been very, very activist in an enforcement-driven way on everything, and not just crypto ‚Äì on everything.""  It's not just Wilson who's frustrated with the situation. Last month, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) called the SEC a ""rogue agency."" SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda recently called Gensler's tenure a ""disaster for the whole [crypto] industry.""  Gensler, for his part, has emphatically denied accusations that his agency hasn't established clear regulations. He frequently points to a 2017 report from the agency (before he joined it in 2021) concluding that tokens issued by a decentralized autonomous organization called ""The DAO"" were securities. He has also swatted aside the industry's pleas for a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto, claiming that ""it already exists"" in the form of the U.S. securities regulatory system that stretches back to the 1930s. At a fireside chat at NYU's law school earlier this month, he testily said, ""Just because people don't like the law doesn't mean there's not law. You don't get to choose.""  Come in and register  Gensler's oft-repeated ""come in and register"" refrain has become something of a joke within the crypto industry. Companies including Coinbase and Robinhood have said they tried to register as broker-dealers and were turned away. (It is worth noting that a few companies, including controversial firm Prometheum, have successfully registered as crypto broker-dealers with the SEC.)  Chelsea Pizzola, counsel for DRW, called the company's rebuffed attempts to register its crypto broker-dealer Cumberland Securities LLC with FINRA (which also plays a role overseeing U.S. markets) ""very frustrating,"" adding: ""We're not the only ones out here saying we tried to register and [who] acquired a broker-dealer, tried for years to use it ‚Ä¶ tried in good faith to engage with the SEC trading and markets staff.""  There is some evidence that Cumberland DRW would have registered with the SEC if such a path were available. In June, the company received a highly coveted but hard-to-get BitLicense from the New York Department of Financial Services. NYDFS is known to be an exacting regulator and getting a BitLicense takes, on average, three years. But compared to Cumberland's experience attempting to register with the SEC, NYDFS seemed flexible in its approach to crypto regulation.  ""As we were going through the process with [NY]DFS ‚Ä¶ we were also trying to engage with FINRA, trying to engage with the SEC to use our registered broker-dealer,"" Pizzola recounted. ""We were getting so much more traction with [NY]DFS. It's a long and complicated process, but we at least felt like we were making progress, moving forward and weren't being stonewalled.""  Slowing evolution  Though not registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer, Cumberland DRW is a regulated entity. It's been a leading liquidity provider to the crypto industry since its inception in 2014. And, due to parent company DRW's TradFi pedigree, it has served as a self-described bridge from crypto to the traditional financial world.  Wilson speculated that it's possible the SEC enforcement action could be a way to slow down the evolution of crypto.  ""There are some people in government who believe that it's best that government has complete control,"" Wilson said. ""And I think that crypto, as a decentralizing technology, threatens that, and if you want to slow that down, then certainly going after the TradFi‚Äìcrypto bridge would be a way of doing that.""  Wilson added that some lawmakers and regulators like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are antagonistic toward crypto because they ""really believe in the power of the state,"" which crypto undermines.  ""If that's your worldview ‚Äì that the world is better off with the government having much more control ‚Äì then anything you can do to slow down the progress of crypto is making the world a better place,"" Wilson said. ""And if you have to do it in a way that's a little bit unfair to market participants, well, you're still making the world a better place.""  Throwing down the gauntlet  Wilson and his company are ready for another fight against a Gensler-led regulatory agency.  In a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Oct. 10, a spokesperson for the firm wrote: ""We have proven before our firm's willingness to defend ourselves against overzealous regulators wielding their power in ways that harm rather than benefit the market. ‚Ä¶ We are ready to defend ourselves again.""  Wilson told CoinDesk that the best-case outcome for Cumberland DRW is a dismissal akin to the one he received in 2018.  ""This is such a Kafka-esque situation. I'm hopeful that the courts will see just how ludicrous this is and we'll straighten things out,"" he said with a laugh. ""The shortest, fastest, easiest outcome would be if the judge just dismisses it.""  But beyond a dismissal, Wilson and Pizzola said their hope for the case is that it will lead to clarity for Cumberland DRW and other market participants.  ""We are good actors. We just want people like us to be able to innovate and engage productively,"" Pizzola said. ""We just don't see the rationale for this kind of destructive engagement.""  Wilson said beating the CFTC cost DRW a lot of money ‚Äì money that the firm, as one of the nation's largest trading firms, could afford. The SEC kerfuffle has already cost DRW a lot, he said.  ""It's really unfortunate,"" Wilson said. ""In the CFTC case, there were a lot of our resources wasted and taxpayers. Now with the SEC, a tremendous amount of taxpayer resources are wasted on these cases. Obviously, there were people who did bad things in crypto and the SEC should go after these people.""  But in the case of DRW and others like Coinbase, ""There was no path to registration, and the SEC said, 'You failed to register.'""",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/23/whos-afraid-of-gary-gensler-not-don-wilson-the-trader-who-beat-the-regulator-once-before,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cd447ac49d4bec01aa4fac6e398137c5bc17431-3036x1708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35044046,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649250,1729674027,"Ethereum Leverage Ratio Reaches Extreme Levels, What It Means","Data shows the Ethereum Estimated Leverage Ratio has shot up to extreme levels recently. Here‚Äôs what this could imply for the asset‚Äôs price. Ethereum Leverage Ratio Appears To Have Been Rising Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the ETH Estimated Leverage Ratio has continued its uptrend recently. The ‚ÄúEstimated Leverage Ratio‚Äù here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Ethereum Open Interest and Derivatives Exchange Reserve. The Open Interest is a measure of the total amount of derivatives positions related to ETH that are currently open on all exchanges, while the Derivatives Exchange Reserve keeps track of the amount of ETH sitting in the wallets of all derivatives platforms. Related Reading: Bitcoin Signal That Led To At Least 70% Surge Has Formed Again When the value of the Estimated Leverage Ratio rises, it means positions on exchanges are growing at a faster rate than the collateral inflows. Such a trend suggests the investors are opting for a higher amount of leverage on average. On the other hand, the indicator going down implies the appetite for risk is decreasing among the derivatives market users, as they are taking on a lower amount of leverage. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum Estimated Leverage Ratio over the past year or so: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Estimated Leverage Ratio had reached high levels earlier in the year, but its value had seen a plunge as the asset‚Äôs price had gone through its crash in late July/early August. Over the last couple of months, however, the indicator has seen a resurgence, with its value now completely recovering back to the same highs as before. This suggests that the investors have been opening leveraged positions on the market. Historically, an overleveraged market has generally resulted in volatility for the ETH price. This is because of the fact that a mass liquidation event, popularly called a squeeze, is probable to occur whenever the derivatives users are taking on high risk. Earlier in the year, the increase in the Ethereum Estimated Leverage Ratio had come alongside a surge in the price, which implies the leveraged positions cropping up had been long ones. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Watch Out: Miners Showing Unusual Exchange Inflow Activity Usually, a squeeze is more likely to affect the side of the market that‚Äôs more dominant, which may be why the overleveraged market from back then had culminated into a long squeeze. The recent increase in the metric has come while Ethereum has been displaying an overall bearish trajectory, so the new leveraged positions may be short ones. If this is indeed the case, then the coin could end up witnessing a short squeeze alongside a rally. ETH Price Ethereum had seen a break above $2,700 earlier, but the coin appears to have seen a pullback as it‚Äôs now trading around $2,600.

42415713,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomd54,1729671402,"DOGE, XRP Lead Crypto Majors Decline as Bitcoin ETFs Bleed $80M","Bitcoin failed to sustain a rally towards $70,000, influencing a broader market decline where the CoinDesk 20 index also fell by nearly 2%.  U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs saw a break in their inflow streak with a net outflow, suggesting a shift in investor sentiment or profit-taking after recent gains.  Traders said the stablecoin volume, which often correlates with liquidity and buying power in the crypto market, has not grown, potentially signaling a slowdown in crypto market growth.  Dogecoin {{DOGE}} and xrp (XRP) led losses among majors tokens amid a broader market downturn as traders took profits from a move higher earlier this week and U.S.-listed bitcoin {{BTC}}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) snapped a 7-day inflow streak.  DOGE dropped 5% while XRP fell 4% as bitcoin failed to continue a Monday rally to nearly $70,000. The tokens led gains among majors in the past 7 days on an Elon Musk endorsement and fundamental developments, respectively.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, fell nearly 2% while bitcoin lost 1%. Traders, however, foresee a run to $80,000 in the coming weeks as the U.S. elections draw near, regardless of who is elected president.  Market action remained generally flat on mid-caps and low-caps. However, memecoin bonk (BONK) and governance token APE dropped over 7% to lead losses among smaller tokens.  Traders pointed out that a key bitcoin resistance and a pause in stablecoin issuances were among the causes for a slow uptrend in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  ‚ÄúThe main reason for the entire crypto market's subsidence seems to be Bitcoin, which the bears defended against an assault on the $70K level,‚Äù Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk in an email. ‚ÄúThey intensified selling at $69.5K early in the day on Monday and dropped the price to $66.5K on Tuesday morning.‚Äù  ‚ÄúStablecoin volume has not increased since late September, setting up a potential pause in the growth of the broader cryptocurrency market, as stablecoins are often seen as liquidity for quick purchases of coins of interest. The previous growth momentum was from August to September, when the overall crypto market capitalization pushed off the bottom,‚Äù Kuptsikevich added.  Stablecoin liquidity and growth are closely related to higher bitcoin and crypto prices, as a CoinDesk analysis previously showed.

42415727,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomdYW,1729669228,Bitcoin Nears 'Golden Cross' Amid Overhyped Concerns About Rising U.S. Treasury Yields,"Concerns about rising U.S. Treasury yields and Fed's supposed policy mistake may be overblown, according to TS Lombard.  BTC's daily chart shows an impending golden cross, signaling bullish outlook.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} latest failure to surpass $70,000 has analysts scrambling for an explanation, with some worrying the ongoing rise in the U.S. Treasury yields could lead to an extended drop.  The concerns, however, may be overblown, and the path of least resistance for bitcoin remains on the higher side, consistent with the upcoming coveted ""golden cross"" price pattern.  The yield on the U.S. 10-year note topped its 200-day simple moving average Monday, reaching a three-month high of 4.26% at press time, according to charting platform TradingView. The benchmark bond yield has surged 60 basis points since the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points on Sept. 18.  The rise in the so-called risk-free rate makes bonds more appealing, often sucking out money from relatively riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and technology stocks. Interestingly, bitcoin's ascent ran out of steam on Monday at nearly $70,000, and prices have since retreated to $67,000.  Pseudonymous analyst The Great Martis, who often describes bitcoin as Nasdaq ETF, sees a perfect storm for risk assets as bond yields surge.  Several others see the post-rate cut uptick in the yield as a evidence of a policy mistake, comparing the recent outsized 50 basis point rate cut implemented in a non-recessionary environment with the premature easing of 1967. Back then, the central bank cut rates in the face of a tighter labor market, paving the way for broad-based inflation that eventually led to a recession in a couple of years.  The fears likely stem from the hotter-than-expected September jobs report and inflation data, which have dented the case for continued Fed rate cuts, adding upward pressure on yields.  TS Lombard disagrees  London-based macroeconomic research firm TS Lombard disagrees with the narrative.  ""Central banks think policy is tight and want to cut gradually. If employment cracks, they will cut fast. If employment bounces, they will cut less. Two months ago, bonds were pricing a strong possibility of falling behind the curve. Now the recession skew is gone, yields are up. That is not bearish risk assets and it doesn't mean the Fed has screwed up,"" Dario Perkins, managing direction, global macro at TS Lombard, said in a note to clients on Oct. 17.  ""If someone is making a mistake, it is those who anchor their views on a 'policy error' ‚Äì seemingly irrespective of what authorities do,"" Perkins added.  The research note explained that Fed rate cuts won't restoke inflation as it did in 1967 for several reasons, including the rollover of debt at higher rates, while stressing that the recent rise in Treasury yields is consistent with the past ""non-recessionary rate cuts.""  The chart shows the performance of the 10-year yield in 12 months following the initial rate cut of the past non-recessionary easing cycles.  Except for 1984, the 10-year yield hardened after the first rate cut., which means what we are seeing right now is not surprising and may not lead to a significant outflow of money from risk assets and into bonds.  Besides, according to the Fed, the neutral interest rate, which is neither stimulatory nor tight, is in the 2¬Ω-3% range ‚Äì 200 basis points below the present Fed funds rate (the benchmark interest rate) range of 4.75% to 5%.  In other words, the recent rate cut is not necessarily a policy mistake and the central bank ""can cut a lot even if the economy is resilient,"" according to Perkins.  Note that gold, a zero-yielding traditional safe haven asset, has been setting record highs in the face of rising nominal and real yields, offering bullish cues to perceived store of value assets like bitcoin.  Golden cross  BTC's 50-day SMA has turned up and looks set to move above the 200-day SMA in the coming days, confirming what is known as the ""golden crossover.""  The pattern indicates that the short-term price momentum is outperforming the long-term, potentially evolving into a bull run. The moving average-based indicator is often criticized for being a lagging signal and trapping traders on the wrong side of the market.  While that's largely true, there have been instances of the Golden Cross presaging major bull runs.  A trader holding BTC for a year following the occurrence of the first two golden crosses and the one in May 2020 would have made triple-digit percentage returns. The cryptocurrency doubled in value to new lifetime highs over $73,000 following the golden cross dated Oct. 30, 2023.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/23/as-bitcoin-nears-golden-cross-concerns-about-rising-treasury-yields-look-overhyped,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/866ca352778258212f27579692bc7b2efdbf5843-1280x880.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35041375,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649316,1729668656,"XRP Transactions Fall, But Active Wallets And DeFi Liquidity Tell A Different Story","XRP, the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen an interesting trend in its transaction activity, despite a few notable declines in other metrics. A recent analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst, Wenry, sheds light on key trends within the XRP ecosystem, offering insights into the activity happening behind the scenes. The analyst particularly revealed where XRP transactions are used by category activity. Related Reading: XRP Price Stays Range-Bound: Will It Soon Make a Move? XRP Transactions: Decline in NFT Activity And Rise in DEX Volume According to Wenry, XRP‚Äôs daily transaction volume has been ‚Äúcompetitive with major Layer 1 networks,‚Äù showing that XRP‚Äôs Ledger remains highly active, even though it is less known to retail investors than other blockchain networks. In his analysis posted on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, Wenry highlighted that between September 15 and October 15, 2023, the creation of new wallets on the XRP Ledger increased by 10.39%, reaching a total of 18,321 new accounts. However, total transactions on the network fell by 17.57% to 18.82 million, and payments dropped by 26.16% to 6.81 million. Despite these declines, the number of active wallets on XRPL increased by 14.19%, indicating sustained user engagement with the platform. These numbers suggest that while fewer transactions are being processed, the active user base continues to grow. Wenry‚Äôs analysis explored on-chain activity related to token trading and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. While total trades on the XRP Ledger dropped by 6.83%, decentralized exchange volume increased by 17.64%, from $3.91 million to $4.60 million. This shift suggests that despite a slight decrease in overall trading, more activity occurred on decentralized platforms, demonstrating continued interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions on the XRP Ledger. Regarding non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the analysis showed a significant decline in NFT-related activities on the XRPL. NFTokenMint, which tracks new NFTs created on the network, dropped by 70.66%, from 65,021 to 19,076. Similarly, NFTokenAcceptOffer, which represents the acceptance of offers to buy NFTs, fell by 30.88%. Despite these declines, NFTokenCancelOffer, a metric that tracks canceled NFT transactions, slightly increased by 0.20%, indicating that while fewer NFTs were being minted or traded, some stability remained in the broader NFT ecosystem. AMM Liquidity and Increased Participation A key highlight of the analysis was the strong growth in Automated Market Maker (AMM) liquidity on the XRP Ledger. AMM-related metrics saw considerable increases, with AMMDeposit rising by 62.35%, AMMCreate increasing by 143.10%, and AMMWithdraw climbing by 42.97%. These increases reflect rising confidence in the liquidity pools on the XRPL, as more participants provide liquidity and create new pools. The surge in AMMCreate, which jumped from 58 to 141, suggests that more users are participating in liquidity provision on the network. Related Reading: XRP Network Activity Surges As Price Seeks To Break $0.55 Resistance However, one area of decline in AMM-related activity was the AMMBid, which dropped by 81.82%. Despite this decrease, the overall rise in liquidity deposits and the creation of new pools indicate that the XRP Ledger‚Äôs decentralized liquidity offerings remain strong. According to Wenry, these metrics highlight the growing trust in existing liquidity pools and the broader AMM ecosystem on the XRP Ledger.

42415703,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomcmK,1729667547,MakerDAO Contemplates Dropping Sky Brand as Community Debates,"MakerDAO's community is set to debate dropping the Sky brand.  A formal governance poll is scheduled for November 4.  MakerDAO is contemplating dropping the Sky brand after a lukewarm reception to the re-brand and a successful launch of the USDS stablecoin.  The USDS stablecoin, launched in August, is designed to offer native token rewards and operate alongside the existing DAI synthetic stablecoin, which remains unchanged. On-chain data shows it has a supply of $1.2 billion and offers a savings rate of 6.5%, with a general agreement amongst community members that the launch was successful.  ‚ÄúIt is also now more clear than ever just how much the DeFi community loves and trusts the Maker brand,‚Äù Sky co-founder Rune Christensen wrote on its governance forum. ""There was a lot of affinity for the brand and what it stands for: stability, security, and DeFi scale. And there is a lot of commitment to holding the MKR token versus upgrading to SKY.""  Christensen wrote that three proposals are being considered to address community concerns: continue with Sky as the core brand to build on its recent momentum, recenter the Maker brand with its original identity and reinstate MKR as the sole governance token, or bring Maker back with a refreshed brand that aligns with the current ecosystem while maintaining its established trust and stability.  Several contributors have pointed out that the introduction of the SKY token, which replaced MKR as the core governance token under the Sky ecosystem, has not delivered the anticipated growth.  In the last two weeks, SKY is down 23% while the CoinDesk 20, an index fund that measures the performance of the largest digital assets, is up 10%. MKR, the governance token, is down 24% on-year according to CoinDesk data.  The controversial ""freeze function,"" introduced to ensure regulatory compliance, has also been criticized for its lack of clear utility and potential long-term risks.  With 13.79 million DAI and 9,535 MKR (approximately $25 million in total) spent on the rebrand, Christensen said MakerDAO will host a community call to gather feedback about the re-brand, then the platform will conduct a formal governance poll on November 4 to determine its next steps.",NEUTRAL,MKR | DAI,MARKET | MKR | DAI,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/23/makerdao-contemplates-dropping-sky-brand-as-community-debates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7166b0907cdfa3f2a8e6234dd3e71d6c65a0824-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415702,WEE6jQWt4rgJorpzkomcje,1729666363,"Bitcoin Is Going to $80K Regardless of Trump or Harris Win, Traders Say","Crypto options traders are increasing their bets that bitcoin will touch fresh highs by the end of November, per Bloomberg.  Options due to expire on November 8 have their highest open interest at the $75,000 strike price, indicating a key market focus area for that period.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} may cross previous highs in the coming weeks regardless of which candidate becomes the U.S. president, some traders say, in a shift of tone ahead of the November elections.  Traders have long perceived Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs victory as a bullish catalyst for the industry for his pro-crypto stance and promises to make the U.S. a bitcoin powerhouse. Democrat Kamala Harris, on the other hand, has not made similar promises but said he would introduce regulations to protect certain groups.  Such stances have skewed expectations of a Republican win as better for bitcoin. However, some say the asset is poised to go higher either way as several macroeconomic factors weigh in.  ‚ÄúBoth Presidential candidates have adopted pro-crypto stances to appeal to voters, but it's tough to say if any of their promises will come to pass,‚Äù Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at crypto exchange BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ‚ÄúHowever, It is clear that the market is responding positively to the upcoming change in administration and policies - whether it's Harris or Trump, traders and investors think any sort of change will be good.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe fact that this coincides with the first Fed rate cuts in four years and a recent run-up in stock prices only adds to the thesis that Bitcoin could surpass its all-time high and reach $80,000,‚Äù Mei added.  Options traders are already increasing bets that bitcoin will touch fresh highs by the end of November, as previously reported. The implied volatility for bitcoin options due around election day is elevated.  The open interest for call options expiring on November 29 shows a significant concentration at the $80,000 strike price, followed by a notable interest at the $70,000 level. For call options with expiration on December 27, the open interest is primarily grouped around the $100,000 and $80,000 strike prices.  Options due to expire on November 8 have their highest open interest at the $75,000 strike price, indicating a key market focus area for that period.  However, some are terming the price behavior as an election hedge rather than a bullish outlook.  ‚ÄúI wouldn't say that people buying 80K calls on BTC to be a bet on higher prices, but is more like a cheap option (implied vol really hasn't gone up that much) against a broader market rally,‚Äù Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  ‚ÄúBTC vol skews heavily in favor of higher prices post election, but that has been the case for quite a few weeks now as an election 'hedge,‚Äù Fan added.

Will Bitcoin Benefit From Rising Retail Participation? According to a recent analysis by on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, BTC transactions worth less than $10,000 are rising, reflecting a shift in the market‚Äôs sentiment from risk-averse to risk-on. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Through $65,000, Is ‚ÄúUptober‚Äù Rally Just Getting Started? Tracking transactions under $10,000 helps gauge retail activity. Unlike institutional transactions driven by fundamentals and long-term outlooks, market sentiment and news often influence retail activity. Per the analysis, Bitcoin‚Äôs retail demand struggled to rebound after the cryptocurrency‚Äôs all-time high (ATH) in March 2024. However, retail demand has surged 13% in the past 30 days with room for further growth. During this same period, BTC gained approximately 7%, rising from $63,142 on September 22 to $67,346 by October 22. Both rising retail on-chain activity and price suggest a potential upside for BTC in Q4 2024. The swift recovery of BTC and other cryptocurrencies following Iran‚Äôs offensive against Israel earlier this month also signals a return to risk-on behavior in the digital asset market. It is worth noting that although retail on-chain activity diminished over the last four months, institutional investors continued to maintain ‚Äúa high amount of transactions and absorption of coins.‚Äù The analysis reads in part: This recent rise in bitcoin is causing small investors to return to trading, signaling the beginning of a pattern of lower risk aversion. Is A Q4 2024 Rally On The Horizon? The return of Bitcoin retail on-chain activity is an encouraging sign that suggests renewed interest among retail investors toward the leading digital asset. However, with the looming US presidential elections, there could be more volatility ahead for BTC price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Braces For Volatility Ahead Of Chinese Stimulus Speculations, Options Expiry According to several crypto analysts and trading firms, the likelihood of a crypto Q4 2024 rally hinges on the results of the US presidential elections. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan recently remarked that ‚Äúanything other than a Democratic sweep‚Äù would benefit BTC propel to $80,000 in Q4 2024. Bitcoin dominance, a metric that measures BTC‚Äôs share of the overall crypto market, recently hit 58.9%, a new cycle-high. While this is promising for BTC‚Äôs future price, a further surge in dominance could harm altcoins‚Äô performance. As a result, Q4 2024 may bring a new ATH for BTC but muted returns for altcoins. It is also worth considering that the renewed retail demand for digital assets might be geography-specific, and not uniform worldwide. For instance, in South Korea, BTC is trading at slightly lower prices than global prices due to a negative ‚Äòkimchi premium,‚Äô hinting low domestic investor sentiment toward digital assets. BTC trades at $67,346 at press time, down 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

35037807,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649397,1729661453,"Bitcoin Options Traders Set Sights On $80,000 By November-End, Regardless Of US Election Outcome","As the US presidential election approaches, the crypto community is buzzing with speculation regarding how the outcome will affect the Bitcoin price. With just 15 days until the election between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, options traders are increasingly optimistic about a new all-time high for Bitcoin, regardless of who wins the presidency. Traders Favor Call Options Ahead Of US Election According to a recent report from Bloomberg, options traders are placing significant bets that Bitcoin will reach a record high of $80,000 by the end of November. Notably, implied volatility for Bitcoin options, particularly those expiring around the election day, remains elevated. More traders are favoring call options, which give the buyer the right to buy BTC at new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Breakout Confirmed ‚Äì Top Analyst Predicts $3,400 Target David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime broker FalconX, commented, ‚ÄúI believe the market consensus is that Bitcoin is likely to perform well regardless of the election outcome.‚Äù His analysis indicates that options activity surrounding the upcoming elections shows a distinct bias toward upside potential. The political landscape features contrasting views regarding the nascent cryptocurrency landscape. Trump, who has been a vocal advocate for digital assets over the past months, is viewed by many as a pro-crypto candidate, leading to the characterization of Bitcoin as a ‚ÄúTrump trade.‚Äù On the other hand, Harris has pledged to support a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, a shift from the more stringent oversight seen during the Biden administration, characterized by continuous enforcement actions and lawsuits against key players of the sector. Per the report, in addition to political factors, traders are also considering non-political influences such as potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and ongoing inflation concerns, which contribute to a generally optimistic sentiment. Data Reveals Strong Demand For $80,000 Bitcoin Calls Data from Deribit, a crypto options exchange, reveals a declining put-to-call ratio, indicating that more traders are buying call options than puts as the year draws to a close. Yev Feldman, co-founder of SwapGlobal, elaborated on the current trading patterns seen among investors, stating: ‚ÄúWe are seeing traders buying calls near $68,000 and puts near $66,000, suggesting that many are positioning for a breakout in either direction.‚Äù Feldman further added that there‚Äôs limited reason to expect a downward collapse post-election, making upward movement seem more plausible for the leading crypto of the market. Related Reading: Solana Eyes New All-Time High Of $370 After Cup And Handle Breakout Open interest data also shows that call contracts set to expire on November 29 are heavily concentrated around the $80,000 mark, with the second most popular strike price at $70,000. For contracts expiring on December 27, interest is clustered around $100,000 and $80,000, while the most sought-after strike price for calls expiring on November 8 is $75,000. Interestingly, call options are commanding higher premiums than their put counterparts, according to the skew term structure, which reflects pricing dynamics between these options. ‚ÄúThis indicates that investors are leveraging the options market more as a tool for capturing potential upside rather than as a hedge against downside risks,‚Äù Lawant explained. The researcher also pointed out that opinions on non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies remain divided, with less consensus on how these assets might perform under varying electoral scenarios.

Uniswap Processes Over $2 Trillion On Ethereum Since launching in late 2018, on-chain data shows that the DEX has processed over $2 trillion in cumulative volume on the Ethereum mainnet. Related Reading: Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Strategy To ‚ÄòMake Millions‚Äô By March 2025 The steady climb in cumulative volume points to Uniswap‚Äôs growth over the years and the team‚Äôs dedication to ensuring that the platform functions as originally designed. Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, Uniswap relies on smart contracts for swapping. All transactions are initiated from a non-custodial wallet such as MetaMask, ensuring the holder retains control of all assets. No transaction is approved unless the wallet owner authorizes it. For the unique value proposition Uniswap presents, the platform continues to grow by leaps and bounds. The latest data from DeFiLlama reveals that the DEX manages over $4.9 billion worth of assets. At this level, Uniswap is the sixth largest DeFi protocol, cementing the dominance of Ethereum-based dapps. While users can choose from three protocol versions, the latest iteration, v3, is the largest, managing over $3 billion. Uniswap v3 was the first DEX to introduce concentrated liquidity to improve capital efficiency. Besides v3, users can swap on Uniswap across multiple chains, including the BNB Chain and Avalanche. However, DEX trading via Uniswap is popular on Ethereum, where the exchange manages over $3.9 billion. DeFi Dominance, UNI To $12? As DeFi gains traction and more traders opt to swap trustlessly, Uniswap will likely process even more transactions. Most importantly, the DEX may dominate DEX trading on Ethereum layer-2s, looking at trends. DeFiLlama data reveals that the dapp has a total value locked (TVL) of over $277 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Signal That Led To At Least 70% Surge Has Formed Again Considering the role of the DEX on Ethereum and the fact that it is among the biggest contributors of gas fees, UNI could benefit in the coming sessions. From the daily chart, UNI is posting impressive higher highs and approaching a key resistance level. After dumping to $4.7 in early August, the token has almost doubled in valuation and is on the cusp of printing fresh Q4 2024 highs.

There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $2,650 and $2,680 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Starts Consolidation Ethereum price started a downside correction from the $2,750 resistance like Bitcoin.

There was a minor increase above the $2,620 level. The price traded close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,757 swing high to the $2,605 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, the price is struggling to gain bullish momentum.

The first major resistance is near the $2,700 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,757 swing high to the $2,605 low. A clear move above the $2,700 resistance might send the price toward the $2,750 resistance. An upside break above the $2,750 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions.

35033464,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649229,1729652442,"Cardano‚Äôs Pullback Short-Lived, Fresh Rally Underway For ADA?","Cardano (ADA) has made a strong comeback, with bulls stepping in to reverse the recent pullback and drive a fresh rally. After a brief period of downward pressure, the cryptocurrency is gaining traction once again, sparking renewed optimism among traders and investors. With positive momentum building, Cardano is showing signs of further upside movement, positioning it for continued gains toward the $0.4233 mark. The question now is whether bulls can sustain this surge and push ADA toward new highs. As the uptick progresses, this article aims to analyze ADA‚Äôs recent price movement, with a focus on how the bulls reversed the pullback and sparked a new rally. It will examine the current bullish path, evaluate key support and resistance levels, and explore the potential for sustained upward movement in the near term. Bullish Momentum Returns: How Cardano Reversed The Pullback On the 4-hour chart, Cardano has turned bullish, currently holding its position above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) printing multiple green candlesticks. As long as the price remains above this level, the bulls will likely maintain control, with the possibility of further gains if the upward trend persists. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a notable surge, rising to 63% after previously dipping to 53%. This increase reflects growing bullish momentum, suggesting that buying pressure is gaining strength in the market. While the current level is still below overbought territory, the upward shift in RSI signals increased demand and could pave the way for additional upside. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Eyes a Potential Recovery: Can It Bounce Back? Also, the daily chart shows that Cardano is actively trying to break above the 100-day SMA, a key resistance level. Successfully surpassing this SMA could indicate a stronger optimistic trend and boost investor confidence, attracting more buyers. If ADA clears this resistance, it may lead to a shift in market sentiment and more upward movement. The RSI on the daily chart is currently at 53%, indicating a bullish trend for ADA, as it is above the critical 50% threshold. Typically, this suggests that buying pressure is outpacing selling pressure, reflecting strong momentum and growing trader optimism about ADA‚Äôs price potential. Support And Resistance Levels To Watch In The Coming Days On the upside, the $0.4233 resistance level is critical, as a successful breakout above this point could signal a stronger uptrend and draw in more buying interest. Should ADA surpass $0.4233, the next significant resistance to monitor will be at $0.5229. Clearing this level further bolsters bullish pressure, potentially leading to even higher price targets as market sentiment shifts favorably. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Struggles: Can Bulls Prevent Further Losses? Meanwhile, on the downside, the first support level to monitor if the bulls are unable to maintain their momentum is $0.3389. A break below this level could result in additional losses, possibly driving the price toward the next support level at $0.2388, which may further extend to lower support zones if selling pressure continues.

In a week, the meme coin has gone pretty high at a 30% increase which propelled its 24-hour trading volume to $1.9 billion with an upsurge of 35%. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Soars: Analyst Predicts 71% Rally In ‚ÄòMeme Super Cycle‚Äô ‚Äì Details Positive Sentiment And Indicators For DOGE Ascent According to market analysts, there are a number of indicators that show it is the right time to invest in DOGE. As observed by Digitalcoinprice, several technical signals have already turned green, indicating traders see brightness in the future of the token. The coin has risen by 37% in the last 30 days. The forecasts hint that the coin might go even higher. One of the strongest indications of the bull trend is the curve of the 50-day Simple Moving Average going upward, which may be a good period for buyers to get in on the action. However, the traders are holding back as the 200-day SMA is going down. As reported by some, DOGE may even go to $0.13 before the year ends. Nevertheless, on the bigger picture, there is still a consensus over the fact that it is still moving in a positive direction for the medium-term trends of the coin. Experts‚Äô Predictions And Influences On Dogecoin‚Äôs Future Other high-level cryptocurrency traders also, such as DonAlt, believe that Dogecoin has the makings of being bullish and can potentially exceed the $1 mark. Analysts like Crow see the occasional triangular patterns of Dogecoin in its price chart that reflect phases of consolidation from 2014 to 2021 and can indicate a breakout.

A passing comment by the ‚ÄúUS Department of Government Efficiency‚Äù (D.O.G.E) has caused a price surge. Adding to this complexity is his political involvement in recent news.

35028206,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649227,1729641651,"Ethereum Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle, Next Stop $3,400?","The Ethereum price has just broken out of a key symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling a potential surge to new levels above $3,000. The recent breakout is seen as a bullish indicator for the top altcoin by analysts who have closely watched the Ethereum price action for the past few months. Ethereum Price Breaks Out Of Key Triangle Pattern A popular crypto analyst identified as ‚ÄúTheMoonCarl‚Äù on X (formerly Twitter) has disclosed that the Ethereum price has finally broken out from its symmetrical triangle pattern. Sharing a chart illustration of the distinctive technical pattern, the analyst revealed to his 1.3 million followers that the symmetrical triangle pattern had begun forming in August 2024, extending through September and October to potentially reach a peak around December. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Headed For $35,720? Why Muted Volume Could Trigger Major Crash However, before Ethereum could reach this designated endpoint, its price broke through the upper trendline of the triangle, indicating a potential bullish breakout to new highs. A symmetrical triangle is a key technical pattern that often indicates a period of consolidation followed by a breakout to the downside or upside. In Ethereum‚Äôs case, its price has been on a major consolidation trend, failing to experience similar price surges seen in Bitcoin and other altcoins. With the now broken triangle pattern, TheMoonCarl is setting new bullish price targets at around $3,400 for Ethereum. At the time of the symmetrical triangle breakout, Ethereum was trading at around $2,707. However, as of writing, the cryptocurrency has declined by 3.15%, pushing its current price to $2,629, according to CoinMarketCap. While the analyst is highly optimistic about his $3,400 Ethereum price projection, the cryptocurrency will still have to see a 29.91% increase to achieve this feat. TH Whales Are On The Move Amidst analysts‚Äô bullish predictions for Ethereum and its recent breakout from a key symmetrical triangle pattern, reports have revealed that large-scale investors, typically referred to as ‚ÄúWhales‚Äù are now back in action. Whale Alert, a blockchain tracker and analytics system revealed a series of substantial whale transactions involving the Ethereum token. In the last 24 hours, an Ethereum whale had moved a whopping 12,590 ETH tokens, worth approximately $33.8 million from an unknown wallet to Coinbase. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts XRP Price Direction For This Week, What To Expect Additionally, in the past few hours, another Ethereum whale had transferred 8,452 ETH tokens valued at $22.4 million from an unknown wallet to Binance. Typically, when whales move coins from their private wallets to a centralized exchange, it often indicates that they may be selling off their tokens. While a full-blown sell-off could cast a shadow on Ethereum‚Äôs already slow price momentum, it appears that whales are not only moving ETH to exchanges but also potentially accumulating tokens. Whale Alert has reported that an anonymous whale recently moved 8,811 ETH from Binance to an unknown wallet. These multiple transactions create uncertainty about whether whales are selling more than they are buying. However, with Ethereum‚Äôs recent breakout from its symmetrical triangle pattern, bullish momentum could push prices higher, potentially encouraging more buying activity.
