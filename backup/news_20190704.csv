42382287,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r5Nl,1562252442,Litecoin Outperforms Top-10 Cryptos Ahead of August Reward Halving,"With the supply of new coins to be halved in less than five weeks, litecoin is outpacing its peers.  The fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $123, representing 5 percent gains on a seven-day basis, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  Meanwhile, bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market value, is currently reporting a meager 1 percent gain on a weekly basis. Other top-10 cryptocurrencies are trading mixed as seen in the table below.  Cardano, down 10 percent, is the worst performing top-10 cryptocurrency over the last seven days.  ETH, XRP, BCH, and EOS are flashing red.  Binance coin is up a staggering 481 percent on a year-to-date basis, followed by litecoin, up 305 percent.  Litecoin’s recent relatively shining performance could be associated with the mining reward halving due on Aug. 6 this year.  The process is aimed at curbing inflation by reducing the coins paid out for mining on litecoin’s blockchain by half. So, after Aug. 6, miners will get 12.5 coins for every block mined – down 50 percent from the current reward of 25 coins.  Essentially, miners will be adding fewer coins to the ecosystem, likely leading to less in circulation. The impending supply cut might have helped LTC outperform its peers in the last seven days.  While it is logical to expect the cryptocurrency to rise further in the run-up to the event, the upside looks limited. After all, LTC has already witnessed phenomenal growth in both price and non-price metrics so far this year, and is currently up more than 300 percent on a year-to-date basis.  Meanwhile, litecoin’s hash rate, or computing power dedicated to mining, rose to a record high of 468.1019 TH/s this week. Notably, the metric is currently up 220 percent from the low of 146.2118 TH/s seen in December.  All-in-all, the market may have largely priced in the reward halving already. In fact, if history is a guide, the probability of LTC witnessing a sharp pullback in the run-up to the Aug. 6 event is high.  It is worth noting that LTC had nosedived from $8.72 to $2.55 in 6.5-weeks leading up to the previous reward halving, which took place on Aug. 25, 2015.  Technical charts are also signaling scope for a near-term price drop.  3-day chart  While the bullish higher lows, higher highs pattern is intact, the relative strength index (RSI) is reporting a bearish divergence and the 5- and 10-candle moving averages have produced a bearish crossover.  As a result, the price risks falling to the 200-candle MA, currently at $221. A violation there would expose the 50-candle MA, currently at $83.00.  On the higher side, a high-volume break above $140 is needed to expose the next major resistance lined up at $182 (May 2018 high).

Fittingly published as a Twitter thread by crypto trading platform The TIE, the study found that 38.9 percent of posts on Twitter arose in the U.S., while 10.5 percent came from second place U.K.  Canada, Turkey, India and Australia were next most prolific tweeters, in descending order of volume.  The TIE research also looked at sentiment – that is, whether tweets were talking positively or negatively about bitcoin. It found that of countries with at least 0.5 percent of the total bitcoin tweets, Peru was most positive, with Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Italy in second to fifth place, respectively.  Of those nations striking a more negative tone on the cryptocurrency, Venezuela has recently spawned the most negative posts with 62 percent of total tweets looking on the downsides. The finding is perhaps surprising, since the nation has been viewed as increasingly crypto curious amid its severe national currency crisis. After Venezuela, Mexico, Estonia, Brazil, and Ireland were most negative, again in descending order.  The TIE added that U.S. is generally ""exceedingly positive,"" with 61.5 percent of tweets being favorable toward bitcoin. On average, 59.8 percent of bitcoin tweets are positive globally.  In the thread, the company also posted a global map of sentiment (see below) marking whether each nation is generally more positive or negative.  And with Facebook having recently unveiled its planned Libra cryptocurrency, to a mixed reception, The TIE also took a brief look at sentiment so far on the project.  It found that the U.S. again represents the largest global source of Libra tweets, and that the proportion (43.8 percent) was greater than for bitcoin (39.8 percent). As with bitcoin, the U.K. came in second place regrading Libra posts, with France, Canada and Australia in third to fifth places.  Regarding attitudes toward Libra, the research found there had been a shift since the news broke, with tweets originally tending to be more positive, but more negative (54.8 percent) today.

According to a report by the ABC, Nick and Josie Yeomans put money into a trading scheme discovered on Facebook that used the web domain Coinexx.org (not to be confused with Coinexx.com) and initially saw good returns from their small investments.  Despite fears that it could be a scam, the positive early results saw them put more and more of their savings into Coinexx.org until they had over AU$20,000 invested. A family member was also persuaded to match their investment.  Ultimately, Nick gave up his job based on the returns they were initially getting, the report says. However, after they ran out of funds to invest, the payments dried up and the purported firm closed access to their funds.  To rub salt into their wounds, the couple later received a message via a WhatApp account that had been used to communicate with Coinexx.org, saying:  ""Let me save you the stress, cus you've been through a lot already. Coinexx is a scam. Everything and everyone involved are the same. Don't bother about trying to get back your money. ... Just focus on getting money to take care of your family.""

For the effort, BTG – also Brazil's largest standalone investment bank – will team with Dubai-based asset manager Dalma Capital.  In a press release published Wednesday, the two firms said they would use the Tezos network for the sale of digital securities to ""address a deal pipeline in excess of $1bn for existing and prospective token issuances.""  The deals include the ReitBZ tokenized property offering announced in February, and would further cover a variety of traditional and alternative investments, they noted.  The companies said:  ""Utilizing Tezos, a self-amending blockchain and smart contracts platform will encourage BTG Pactual and Dalma Capital to enhance their digitization efforts, by transacting in digital assets.""  Since the announcement earlier this year, the ReitBZ STO, which uses an ethereum-based token, has launched and passed its soft cap, according to the release.  “While the bank remains protocol and technology agnostic, and will continue to utilize the Ethereum protocol, we see Tezos as a global player with a robust blockchain for asset tokenization” said Andre Portilho, a BTG partner who heads the STO initiative.  Dalma Capital has joined the effort as joint bookrunner (or underwriter) for ReitBZ, and further expects to use Tezos for a number of other asset tokenization projects, from real estate to sports clubs.  “We see Tezos as one of the critical protocols for the burgeoning STO market, and look forward to securing future deal flow on the Tezos blockchain,” said Zachary Cefaratti, Dalma Capital CEO.  Tim Draper, CEO and founder of Draper Associates, which holds a stake in Tezos, said “We are excited to see BTG Pactual and Dalma Capital making use of the Tezos blockchain – we are believers in the Tezos project and see a strong use case for security tokens.”  Tezos image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTG,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | SPONSORED | XTZ | BTG,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/04/brazilian-bank-plans-to-use-tezos-blockchain-for-stos-worth-1-billion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43c7af5329467479df2b63bf6d31fb7a350f2116-1500x915.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382276,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r5CR,1562241614,South Korea's Shinhan Bank Is Cracking Down Harder on Anonymous Crypto Users,"Shinhan Bank, the second largest financial group in South Korea by assets, is redoubling its efforts to police accounts related to cryptocurrency exchanges, according to local press reports. The goal? To completely quash anonymous crypto transactions in the country.  The bank is reportedly planning to increase the number of staff scrutinizing such accounts, as well as continuing to develop systems dealing with potential fraud and monitoring transactions. It also said that it would be working to develop artificial intelligence systems to help it spot suspicious activity.  Because the news suggests a change in policy, it has generated some buzz in the country. But the July 1 move by the institution is little more than the latest step in the refinement of relevant processes and procedures, a development that has been ongoing for more than a year.  Crypto is not being locked out from the Korean banking system. The landscape is evolving with changes in the business and in the compliance environment.  Links between between commercial banks and cryptocurrency exchanges were dramatically altered in early 2018 when the Financial Services Commission (FSC), a regulator, issued a batch of rules. The cryptocurrency-related AML guideline requires traders of crypto on the exchanges to open real-name bank accounts at the same bank servicing the exchange itself.  In short, crypto traders could no longer be anonymous in South Korea.  The document also lays out a number of general anti-money laundering principles for crypto in the country. Suspicious transactions are defined. A bank checklist is mandated, with a line for a source-of-funds determination. And foreigners are prohibited from opening bank accounts for cryptocurrency trading.  What followed was a series of advances and retreats as the sector got comfortable with the regulations and as the regulators fine tuned the requirements.  The rules were updated in June 2018, with the FSC saying that the banks had to begin the constant monitoring of the relevant accounts. It had become concerned about commingling of funds and wanted to make sure the institutions were keeping customer money and deposits for company operations separate.  Late in 2018, the head of the FSC let the sector know that the regulators are accepting of crypto. He said, in no uncertain terms, that banks are permitted to take crypto-related deposits, as long the know-your-customer (KYC) principles outlined earlier in the year were followed.  Around the same time, Kookmin Bank and Nonghyup Bank (NH) came under the scrutiny of the FSC for failures in terms of implementing the anti-money laundering guidelines. The two banks plus Hana Bank were later inspected by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), another domestic regulator, for similar reasons.  The sector has come under additional pressure lately, as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will be requiring the sharing of customer information by cryptocurrency exchanges. It is likely that South Korea will closely adhere to the letter and spirit of what the FATF is demanding. Implementation of the 2018 guidelines will become more of a priority for the regulators.  The institutions themselves have been somewhat manic about the business.  Kookmin Bank, the country's largest bank by assets, reportedly withdrew from offering cryptocurrency accounts for a time, but then in 2019 signed deals to enhance its capabilities in digital currency asset management. Due to the sudden closure of accounts by Kookmin, business gravitated toward Shinhan Bank in early 2018.  The Shinhan news did not seem to worry the exchanges themselves.  ""The Korean government allowed Bithumb to use NH Bank only. Therefore, we have nothing to do with Shinhan Bank, and it is not relevant to our operations,"" according to a source at Bithumb, which is controlled by Singapore's Blockchain Exchange Alliance (BXA) and is by some measures the largest exchange in Korea.

42382292,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r5U3,1562238025,Bitcoin Eyes Independence Day Price Gains for Fifth Year Running,"View  Bitcoin could rise above $12,000 with the daily chart reporting a bullish reversal.  A high-volume bullish breakout on the hourly chart indicates scope for a rise to the bearish lower high at $12,448.  BTC could yet post losses today, however, if prices find acceptance below key support at $11,385.  Bitcoin (BTC) looks set to close in the green on U.S. Independence Day for the fifth consecutive year, having recovered nearly 25 percent from recent lows.  The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose 1.17, 1.79, 3.35 and 1.67 percent on July 4 in 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, according to Bitstamp data.  BTC's Independence Day performance in the years prior to 2015 is mixed. Prices saw little change in 2012, rose 3.16 percent in 2013 and suffered a 2.63 percent loss in 2014.  All-in-all, bitcoin, considered by some observers as an anti-establishment asset, has put on a good show on the U.S. Independence Day in five out of the last seven years.  The cryptocurrency now appears poised to extend the four-year winning trend, as the recovery from recent lows seems to be gathering traction and the short duration charts are now flashing bullish signals.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,600, representing 4 percent gains on a 24-hour basis, having hit a high of $12,061 earlier today. At that price, the cryptocurrency was up more than $2,400, or 25 percent, from the July 21 low of $9,614.  Hourly chart  BTC jumped 4 percent in 60 minutes late on Wednesday, confirming an upside break of the symmetrical triangle – a bullish continuation pattern – on the hourly chart.  Notably, the breakout was backed by a sharp rise in buy volumes (green bars). In fact, buy volume climbed to its highest since July 1, invalidating the bearish volume divergence represented by the falling trendline.  Therefore, the path of least resistance is on the higher side and prices could rise toward the bearish lower high of $12,448 created on June 26.  While the momentum has cooled somewhat in the last 10 hours, the minor price pullback seems to have taken the shape of a bull flag – a pause that often restarts with upwards momentum.  The probability of BTC posting daily gains with a UTC close above today's opening price of $12,061 would drop if the price finds acceptance below $11,385 – the low of yesterday's high-volume bullish candle (horizontal line).  That, however, looks unlikely, as the daily chart is reporting a bullish candlestick pattern.  Daily chart  BTC rose 10.5 percent on Wednesday, marking a strong follow-through to the dip demand highlighted by the preceding day's bullish hammer candle.  The candlestick pattern indicates the pullback likely ended at $9,614 and thus prices could continue to rise toward the recent high of $13,880.

42382284,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r5Jz,1562230812,Fujitsu Develops Blockchain ID Tech That Scores Trustworthiness in Transactions,"Fujitsu Laboratories has unveiled what it calls ""digital identity exchange technology"" aimed to increase the security of online transactions.  The tech, based on blockchain, makes it possible for individuals and businesses making online transactions to confirm the identity of other parties involved. More importantly, the identification system gauges the the ""trustworthiness"" of the other party's credentials, the firm said in a press release.  According to Fujitsu Labs:  ""The rapid advance of digitalization in recent years has been accompanied by a dramatic rise in the number of online transactions in which users cannot see one another face to face, making it difficult to judge the credibility of the other party and leading to heightened concerns around trust. With reports of fraud and instances of people falsifying personal credentials like work history and professional qualifications growing increasingly prevalent, ensuring the circulation of high-quality, reliable identification data poses an urgent challenge to users and businesses alike.""  The new ID tech addresses this by mutually evaluating the parties in a transaction and looking at past transaction data to analyse the relationships between the parties, as well as others who have transacted with them previously.  Effectively it determines a reputation and rating for each party and records these evaluations on a distributed ledger.  The firm explains:  ""A trustworthiness score is attached to each user by weighting factors including how many trusted users evaluate them highly. Even if a user colludes with a third party to improperly raise their evaluation, the graph-structured relationships will reveal information such as the weakness of their relationships with other users, giving the system the potential to identify misrepresentations.""  Fujitsu said the technology will enable more secure online services, with the added advantage of ""user-friendly"" features such as graphics that provide visualizations of the relationships between users.  The Japanese tech firm has been working on numerous blockchain projects in recent years, from providing the underlying tech for inter-bank settlement, to launching a ""ready to go"" blockchain service that it said could provide a minimum viable product in just five days.  It's also developed tech aimed to spot problems with smart contracts on ethereum platforms.

Lygon – launched with participation from ANZ, Commonwealth, and Westpac banks on July 3 – will collect and digitize data from a test group of Scentre Group lease holders across Australia.  The firms involve hope the Lygon platform will shorten the time it takes for banks to issue guarantees, reducing that time to a day. The same validation could take up to a month if being issued on paper, based on current practices.  Additionally, digitization reduces the risk of fraud and errors across the billions of dollars banks guarantee, the Lygon backers contend. All Australian retailers need a bank guarantee to secure such a lease and operate their stores.  Contingent on a successful pilot, Lygon will offer access to the platform to all bank issuers, lease applicants, and beneficiaries. The five founding members may also expand research into other industry uses.  IBM did not respond to request for comment.  The Lygon effort represents the latest blockchain-based system built specifically for bank guarantees. In 2017, the Belarussian Central Bank approved usage of blockchains for this kind of service, and in 2018 the multinational banking firm Standard Chartered partnered with manufacturing giant Siemens for a trade finance bank guarantee pilot.  A similar pilot involving IBM, Westpac, Scentre Group and ANZ was successfully concluded in 2017.
