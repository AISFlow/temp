42403923,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh1jN,1580505447,Options Growth Will Ignite Innovation in the Bitcoin Market – But Not in the Way You Think,"Richard Rosenblum is co-founder and co-head of trading at crypto liquidity provider GSR. The opinions below are the author's and do not reflect the position of CoinDesk.      Like futures, the launch of bitcoin options on major exchanges has been met with anticipation.      Hopeful observers believe the CME's and Bakkt’s entry into the burgeoning options market will further encourage institutional participation. It will – but not necessarily in the way they expect.      For major institutions, miners and other corporates involved in the space, options open a new, powerful tool for managing risk and volatility. But, as we can see from other financial markets, these capabilities won’t come from the listed options themselves. Instead, the real action will take place in over-the-counter hedges. While these corporate-focused products will rely on vanilla option liquidity, they will not take place on exchanges.      Before we explain why this is the case, it’s worth highlighting the growing demand for options as a means to hedging. Options have been the fastest-growing product segment of the crypto market in 2019, with the trajectory of volumes likely to accelerate in 2020. Crypto derivatives volumes are nascent compared to the spot market and the size by which some financial derivatives dwarf their respective spot markets. Nonetheless, the emergence of a variety of derivatives should have a significant influence on the growth of the space.      Now, to understand how the options market will serve as the foundation for corporate risk management, I can draw upon my experience managing hedging programs at Goldman Sachs for some of the world’s biggest corporations. There, the focus was on helping entities with natural exposures hedge their risks. On the supply side, the biggest yearly trade in commodities was when Mexico would buy puts to hedge their royalties on the country’s oil production. On the demand side, airlines and shipping companies would come to market to lock in forward prices to hedge their consumption. However, these entities rarely traded ""listed"" exchange products directly. Characteristics of listed options products are not a good fit for corporate risk, they are more meant for specialists and speculation. Corporate entities prefer to trade products that are specifically built for them, that utilize the liquidity of the exchange-listed products.      In the crypto world, the single-day expiration date of these products means traders need to deal with the volatility of the expiry day, which could be prone to emotional sentiment or other non-economic factors. A single-day hedge is likely too short in duration for a corporation like a miner to properly protect the value of their outputs or market exposure. Instead, custom-built swaps and options strategies provide a better solution for many in the ecosystem as a hedge, as they would allow the parties to hedge ratably each day as they balance out exposure over longer periods.      Further parallels can be drawn between oil producers and bitcoin miners. Mining costs vary as new equipment comes to market and electricity prices fluctuate. Bitcoin volatility also eats at profitability. With major miners having gone public and/or reporting to a group of shareholders, the pressure to maintain a good balance sheet is growing. Additionally, margin compression resulting from the upcoming halving is likely to push miners to better manage the risk of volatility. More risk will lie in the hands of fewer miners as the market consolidates. Like oil producers, these companies will increasingly look towards hedging solutions to ensure the costs of mining will not outpace market pricing of the resulting digital assets. Lenders will also begin to mandate that miners hedge so they will still be able to meet their obligations as borrowers in the event of a bear market.      Corporates - whether they be oil companies or bitcoin miners - usually do not trade directly on exchanges. They require a different product offering and manner of doing business. In addition to the temporal mismatch resulting from hedging daily risk with a single-day ""bullet"" expiry, futures exchanges are difficult to connect to, as entities must trade through an FCM (Futures Clearing Merchant). This creates space for hedging products tailor-made for crypto-native firms. However, these products still need to hedge the core volatility risk somewhere, so it is first necessary for liquidity to build on listed products. The emergence of liquidity in the listed options market will be the foundation for these types of hedges.      Once companies can hedge these listed products, the risk that is left is more of a residual nature. Market makers are primed to take on these risks and be the trading counterparty for these hedges.      The existence of listed vanilla options on mainstream exchanges is only the beginning. For corporates, miners and others, the excitement lies in what can be done once saturation of underlying liquidity in volatility arrives. This is the base on which a whole host of other volatility-related products can be built, particularly as it relates to corporate hedging and risk management. Ultimately, this helps reduce unwanted exposures and enables more investment. In this way, listed options serve as the starting point for a whole new array of products and services.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Richard Rosenblum,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/31/options-growth-will-ignite-innovation-in-the-bitcoin-market-but-not-in-the-way-you-think,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/17e928362f516021a0a1be605e64f9821e1fbfa5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403919,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh1fR,1580504029,Scotland’s Bitcoiners Share Canny Tales of ‘Buying the Dip’,"This reporter attended his first bitcoin meetup in sunny Scotland on Thursday.      It took place in the Bayes Centre – Edinburgh University’s snazzy artificial intelligence and data science hub. It also happens to be the spot where IOHK, the creators of the Cardano cryptocurrency, helped establish a Blockchain Technology Laboratory.      The topic of the meetup, “Bitcoin, Wealth and Wisdom,” afforded a forensic examination of the largest cryptocurrency’s rollercoaster cycle of price bubbles and corrections with plenty of examples of the emotional trauma that accompanied the ride.      But what appeared, prima facie, to be nothing more than a roomful of rabid maximalists, on closer inspection turned out to be a bunch of canny investors.      “It’s not so much that bitcoin is great, it’s that fiat is so bad,” said an asset manager who asked to be identified only as David. “Going back to the gold standard would be the only thing that would really hurt bitcoin.”      A recurring theme among veterans and newbies alike was buying in after the 2017 price bubble, when bitcoin dropped back down to around $3,500 during the 2018 doldrums.      Kind of fitting to encounter prudent financial behavior, this being Scotland. And of course, not forgetting that Thomas Bayes, the logician and theologian who studied at Edinburgh in 1719, is generally associated with advanced theories around machine learning and probability.      CoinDesk spoke with a number of investors at the meetup to hear what drew them to bitcoin in the first place.    Kenny Huschmann, retired  I read the bitcoin white paper and was like, ‘Yeah, this is massive.’ Not long after that, all this hype was starting because of the big price increase. I have to say, the price increase made me hesitant. I’ve been through the dot-com boom, and it was kind of reminiscent of that.I didn’t buy on the up-shoot. I waited a while for the top to pop. After it dropped down to about $3,000, I was worried the miners might have taken too big a loss and that would have fundamental consequences. So I waited a bit longer. Then I started to buy at about $5,000. I tend not to disclose how much bitcoin I own but I can say it’s about 5 percent of my disposable worth. I might increase that.  Max Sherwood, Edinburgh University master’s student and founder of Wholegrain Crypto  I first heard about bitcoin while browsing Tom’s Hardware and I saw these questions about what is the best graphics card for mining bitcoin. I got into mining but had no idea these coins would really be worth anything. I don’t count myself as a bitcoin maximalist. I like to stay rational.    Indre Karaliute, neuroscientist  Yes, I’m a neuroscientist. I graduated from Edinburgh University. I’m pretty interested in bitcoin. This is not my first meetup. I would say I’m interested in the way people react to bitcoin’s price going up and down, for instance. Like what’s going on inside their brains.  Romanos, Edinburgh University master’s student  My story is that I wanted to buy a motorbike and I had around £2,000 in savings. My dad told me not to burn through my capital but try and use it to make a profit. ‘I don’t care if you buy stocks,’ he said, ‘or if you set up a lemonade stand, or if you buy Greek tobacco and sell it in the UK.’I started to make a theoretical portfolio of stocks and realized I’d have a Ph.D. before I could buy a motorbike. It was when I was looking for alternatives that I discovered bitcoin. I started buying in about September 2017 when it was around $4,000. I went back to Greece in December and cashed out at $18,000.I ended up restoring my grandfather’s motorbike in Greece and I also bought another one when I got back to the UK.  Thomas Dainovec, developer  I bought into bitcoin after it reached $20,000 when it went back down to $3,000. I don’t have any bitcoin at the moment. I sold it.

42403926,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh1lL,1580500862,How Fund Managers View Lending and Staking: 3 Takeaways From a CoinDesk Research Webinar,"Not everyone is totally excited about DeFi.      Volatile crypto is nurturing its fixed-income side. Crypto lending activity is growing on decentralized finance (DeFi) networks. Staking, where investors reap payments for locking up assets in functions essential to network protocols, is moving into crypto's mainstream, with large crypto exchanges offering staking services for users.      The slide above shows the growing popularity of one category of crypto lending, DeFi, among ethereum investors. (You can see that slide and others measuring the Web 3 use case of crypto assets in CoinDesk Research's quarterly review; we'll present the results in a webinar on Tuesday, Feb. 4: sign up here.)      There's some irony in this, like a penny stock offering a dividend, but both lending and staking are emerging as potential factors in investment decisions for crypto investors. In December, we invited two fund managers, both long bitcoin and other crypto assets, for a CoinDesk Research webinar on lending and staking. Jordan Clifford of Scalar Capital and Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital joined us to discuss how they evaluate risk and returns in crypto lending and staking, what crypto assets' risk-free rate might look like and what DeFi needs to do to attract investors and new users.      Here are three takeaways from that conversation. Watch & listen to the entire webinar here.      For background and more information, download our free ""Crypto Lending 101"" report here.    1. DeFi risk factors keep some investors out.    Clifford and Samani had a back-and-forth about the decision to put assets to work in DeFi networks that earn returns. From Clifford's perspective, the technology risks are manageable; Samani said at this point the returns don't justify the risk of losing investor funds to a ""smart contract"" glitch, for any allocation of assets to DeFi.      Here's Clifford on how Scalar evaluates risks. He mentioned bug bounties, security audits and formal verification as ways DeFi networks can de-risk themselves as platforms for earning fixed-income returns on crypto. Human risk is a factor, too: “You really are thinking about counterparty risk as the main one. … And that comes in many forms, actually. Many of these DeFi contracts, they have administrator access that can do various things with those funds at the contract level. This is kind of an early stop-gate for many of these smart contracts to go live before they can be truly decentralized. That’s something to think about. It says it’s a DeFi protocol but often there’s a single organization that has keys to it.""      Whether or not there's human counterparty risk to consider, there's always technological counterparty risk, Clifford said, which can be evaluated along the lines of a Lindy effect: ""Often, the smart contracts themselves, they act as a counterparty in a way, and they need to be vetted for technology risk. … What you’re really looking for is smart contracts that have had a lot of value custodied within them. The more time that’s elapsed, the safer it tends to be. If the contract’s held a billion dollars for several years the odds of it having a serious vulnerability diminish over time.""      For Samani, current interest rates on DeFilending networks don't justify the risks, which include potentially having to send an email to investors explaining how the fund lost their money. ""It wouldn’t be meaningful to our portfolio, so it just wasn’t worth the time,” he said. ""What rate would be meaningful? Samani said Multicoin hasn't made that determination, yet. Is it a 1 percent premium over centralized? Is it a 2 percent premium? At what point are we willing to underwrite that? We’re not there yet; we hope to be there in the next six to 12 months.”      Samani said he's not bullish that decentralized lending will be able to offer substantial premiums over centralized. ""There are always going to be people who will bridge that arbitrage,"" he said.    2. What is crypto's risk-free rate?    Decisions about what's a meaningful rate come down to a premium earned for risk taken. This is usually calculated in reference to a ""risk-free"" rate. Of course, no investment is risk free, and that applies acutely in crypto assets. However, conversation in our crypto lending webinar turned to risk-free rates in crypto and how staking might play a role in determining such a reference point for pricing risk.      ""In general my expectation is that lending and borrowing rates will be higher than staking rates,"" Samani said. ""I think for the most part staking rates, at least within each ecosystem, will be considered the risk-free rate.""      Factors like staking protocols' programmed unbonding period make it different, but there will be workarounds to such lockups, Samani said. For example, exchanges offering staking services may be able to return capital to their users more quickly than direct staking would allow.      Staking isn't free of risk by any means, Samani said, but it eliminates additional layers of risk on top of holding the asset itself. ""It’s native to the protocol,"" he said. ""There’s very few things that are native to the protocol and that is one of the things. My sense is, why deal with borrowing and counterparty risk when you can just rely on the protocol? You’re already relying on the protocol anyways, so if you’re going to rely on the protocol and add counterparty risk you should be compensated for that.""    3. What DeFi needs in order to grow.    Samani wasn't bullish on DeFi, either. ""It’s pretty clear now that it’s pretty circular. There’s not too many people actually using the product. … The upper bound here seems to be the market cap of ETH or some fraction of that,"" he said.      Clifford said DeFi needs better user interfaces and applications: ""We need to polish off the rough edges, get more time, have people talk about their success stories,"" he said. ""I think organic growth will come, it’s just going to take a little while.""      Samani thinks DeFi's growth challenges are more fundamental. Crypto-collateralized loans aren't interesting beyond the bounds of existing ethereum investors. Uncollateralized loans, serving people excluded from the traditional financial system, would achieve that; they may not be practical without additional technology, like sovereign identity and credit scoring that can cross borders and operate outside traditional financial systems, he said.

This happened after Bling conducted its own Twitter campaign, Wan said.      Google did not provide any further clarity around why the game was originally pulled. The company originally told Bling the game was suspended for “deceptive practices,” without clarifying what those practices were.

A Google Play Store spokesperson did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.      “We did inquire after resubmission, but never received a response as to what Google Play perceived as deceptive,” Wan said.

42403910,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh1ZX,1580486162,Ethereum Miners' ETH Holdings Near Record Highs,"Ethereum miners are hoarding ether tokens, and this could indicate high confidence in the project.      The number of ether tokens held by all ETH mining pools is back near its all-time high of 1.69 million ETH set in October, according to crypto market data platform Santiment.      The rise from November's low of 1.64 million has happened in a stable and undisrupted manner.      ""The steady accumulation suggests high confidence levels in the project among the majority block creators, at the very least relative to the current market conditions,"" Santiment's founder Maksim Balashevich wrote in Spencer Noon's monthly Substack newsletter.      The cumulative balance of all ETH mining pools has risen by 11 percent from 1.52 million a year ago.      Notably, miner balances rose sharply from 1.54 million to 1.69 million in four months to October even as prices halved from $366 to $170.      One possible reason miners are willing to accumulate coin balances amid lower prices is market sentiment had turned bullish following the cryptocurrency's 120 percent rally in the first six months. Price dips have been largely viewed as bull market corrections by the analyst community.      The cryptocurrency, however, continued to lose altitude and fell below $170 in late October, prompting some of the miners to liquidate their holdings, as noted by Balashevich.      As a result, cumulative balances fell back to 1.64 million by early November.      Mining profitability is heavily influenced by price gyrations. A sustained price slide hurts revenue, forcing small and inefficient miners to scale back operations. While moving off blockchain, these miners often sell their coins to make up for mining-related losses, adding to bearish pressures around prices.    Looking ahead    Ether’s price has rallied by 36 percent in January, and the broader trend seems to have flipped bullish. Thus, miner balances could soon rise to new record highs above 1.69 million.      “Barring major market volatility this time around, we’re likely to breach this milestone within the next few days,” Balashevich wrote.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/31/ethereum-miners-eth-holdings-near-record-highs,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

CEO Jeremy Welch is stepping down from the role with current head of product Nick Neuman taking the helm. CTO Jameson Lopp will remain in his current position but will join the board along with Neuman.      Welch’s decision to step away from his position was linked to personal matters and not the firm’s product decisions, Welch and Neuman said.      Meanwhile, Casa is getting rid of its node; well, at least its physical implementation.      Neuman told CoinDesk in an interview the firm will ditch its purple-and-white hardware product in favor of bolstering its subscription service. Welch told CoinDesk in October the company had shipped more than 2,000 devices to buyers in over 65 countries.      Casa Node will now be run on open-source software available on most any computer which can be paired with a $10 monthly subscription to its key service. As Neuman said, it’s equivalent to bitcoin key management for the cost of a Netflix subscription.      When asked about possible revenue concerns – given that the lowest Casa Node package currently runs for just under $400 – Neuman said the firm is looking to capitalize on a strong 2019. For Casa, that means learning from its customers.      “A lot of people weren't coming to us for the cost. They were coming to us for the security, the peace of mind,” Neuman said. “We don’t expect this to materially affect our revenue as a company.”      As for other Casa Node features, Neuman said the firm is close to integrating with Coldcard, a bitcoin-only wallet. Generational bitcoin payment plans via inheritance services and different service accounts similar to a checking and savings account are also in the lineup, he said.      “Our main focus is around the success that we’ve seen so far and the growth that we expect to continue to see through this year,” Neuman said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/31/bitcoin-startup-casa-names-new-ceo-as-node-service-goes-open-source,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1dad10744284176d8dcfd788d5c1fdb507e85488-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SBI announced on Friday shareholders could either take the benefit in XRP or another product offered by health food and cosmetics subsidiary SBI Alapromo.      Under the scheme, new shareholders on the company's registry as of the starting date of March 31 can accept XRP to the value of 2,000 yen (around $18), while those who've been shareholders for over a year will receive 8,000 yen ($73.50) in the cryptocurrency.      The Alapromo alternatives include cosmetics, health supplements and brown rice powder. All shareholders are being given a 50-percent discount on supplements and cosmetics sold by the subsidiary.      There is caveat for those who would take the XRP benefit: they must be resident in Japan and have an account at SBI's cryptocurrency exchange VC Trade, which launched in 2018 as the first crypto trading platform backed by a bank.      SBI has been one of the most active corporations in crypto and blockchain. As well as the exchange, it has a crypto mining division that recently was reported to be involved in potentially the world's biggest bitcoin mine under development in Texas.      The firm has also formed a joint venture with Ripple, which is involved in the development of XRP, to offer a cash transfer app called Money Tap.

The Hyperledger Foundation announced Thursday that Fabric 2.0 is designed to improve the usability and performance for the end user, with updates including new features such as decentralized governance for smart contracts and several enhancements for handling and sharing private data on the platform.      Describing the release as a ""key milestone,"" IBM's VP of blockchain platforms, Jerry Cuomo, said it would allow IBM to upgrade its protocol ""to leverage the new capability and improved performance."" Thomas Bohner, VP of blockchain at fintech firm IntellectEU, said the release's new privacy features would help ""drive adoption for our clients on the financial services industry.""      Hyperledger Fabric, the first project developed by the IBM-backed Hyperledger Foundation, gives companies the ability to build a variety of applications that leverage distributed ledger technology. Cloud service providers including AWS, Azure, IBM Google and Alibaba have all integrated its framework into their solutions.      The project welcomed six new members to its consortium last week, including digital business consulting firm Cognizant and the University of Hong Kong.      Initially proposed in 2016, Hyperledger Fabric supports multiple programming languages, including the Solidity language used on ethereum. Being open-source, users have gradually adapted the platform since it went live. Thursday's release, however, is the single largest update to the protocol since its 2017 launch.      Although Hyperledger members see the 2.0 release as a sign of the project's long-term viability, it has not been without setbacks.

42403915,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh1bV,1580472000,Crypto Tax Software Developers Get Serious About System Standards,"A growing number of crypto tax software developers are trying to bolster their products’ technical credibility with the Certified Public Accountant's (CPA) stamp of attestation.      Attestation is an independent review conducted by a CPA, whose report includes conclusions about the reliability of data, statements – or systems, in the case of software services.      Lukka and Verady, two competing developers, both announced on Jan. 21 their tax software solutions have received System and Organization Control (SOC) attestation reports from independent auditors. In doing so, the companies’ respective executives told CoinDesk, they are providing services that clients can trust.      “There have been too many instances where crypto enterprises have failed because they utilize systems to provide service that are suspect and become compromised,” said Lukka CEO Jake Benson.      Lukka and Verady both addressed others’ failures by turning to SOC. It’s a set of standards developed by the American Institute of Certified Professional Accountants (AICPA) to assist auditors and users in evaluating a system’s trustworthiness, said Mimi Blanco-Best, CPA, a senior manager at the AICPA and lead developer of its SOC services.      SOC 1 reports on a system’s reporting controls and SOC 2 reports on its handling of user data and data privacy. Within both levels, Type 1 reports evaluate that system’s control design (does it work properly in the moment) and the Type 2 reports evaluate operational efficacy (does it work properly over time).      Lukka received SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 attestation reports from Friedman LLP (who was once Tether’s auditor) on Jan 21. Verady’s “Legible” tax platform received SOC 1 Type 1 from Cohen and Company.      Blanco-Best, the AICPA product manager, said SOC attestation reports help a business, and its clients and partners, judge a system and manage risk.      “If I get an SOC report – let's say an SOC 2 report – that gives me some comfort in the service provided by an organization, that the organization using my data is handling my data properly,” she said.      Comfort leads to trust, and trust builds relationships with otherwise skittish clientele, Verady CEO Kell Canty said. He added that Verady is continuing to work with Cohen and Company to secure the Type 2 report.      Lukka’s Benson said SOC attestation reports help companies break into wider markets, especially with institutions: “They won’t even do business with a software company if they don’t have one.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/31/crypto-tax-software-developers-get-serious-about-system-standards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/184be6cb153adcda4380939ad39707ac89ecd2f0-997x487.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403932,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh1sE,1580470730,Bitcoin Heads Into Historically Positive February on a Bullish Note,"View  Bitcoin's January surge has put the bulls in the driver's seat, opening the doors for a continued rally into five figures.  A minor pullback to $9,000 could be seen in the next 24 hours or so, with intraday indicators are flashing bearish signals.  The overall bull bias will remain intact as long as prices are holding above recent lows near $8,200.    Bitcoin is holding its bullish trend while heading into the historically strong month of February.      The top cryptocurrency picked up a bid below $7,000 on Jan. 3 and has been on an upward trajectory ever since, rising to three-month highs near $9,570 on Thursday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      At the current price of $9,350, bitcoin is up 30 percent on a month-to-date basis – its best January performance since 2013.      Additionally, the cryptocurrency is on track to register a double-digit monthly gain for the first time since June 2019, when prices had rallied by 26 percent. January’s 30 percent rally is its best monthly performance since May 2019.      This month's rally marks a sharp reversal higher from a six-month downturn when prices collapsed from $13,880 to $6,425. With the bulls still leading the price action, February may again turn out to be a good month for the cryptocurrency.    Bitcoin has eked out gains in February for the last five years.  February saw losses in just two of the last eight years.    The popular narrative for February's good record is Chinese investors tend to liquidate their crypto holdings ahead of the New Year holiday in January and reinvest in February, causing prices to rise.      This time, however, the supposed post-holiday reinvestments may be delayed due to coronavirus outbreak, leading to a weakening of the bullish momentum.      That said, the bitcoin market is currently showing no signs of bull fatigue. “It's difficult to have a bearish argument,” popular trader and analyst @filbfilb tweeted on Thursday.      The analyst is drawing attention to the monthly chart, where the MACD histogram has crossed above zero, confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change.      The bullish bias will strengthen if prices print a monthly close (Friday, UTC) above $9,158, establishing a higher high.      The shorter duration charts are also reporting a strong bullish bias.    Weekly chart    Bitcoin has broken out of a falling channel, indicating a resumption of the rally from lows near $4,100 observed in early April 2019.      The breakout is backed by bullish readings on both the MACD histogram and the relative strength index.      The weekly chart is aligned in favor of a rally toward $10,350 (October high).    Daily chart    While the daily candle is red, the losses may be reversed later today as the odds are stacked in favor of the bulls.      Bitcoin defended the former resistance-turned-support of $9,188 on Thursday with a bullish engulfing candle. That solidified the preceding day’s breakout above that level and signaled a continuation of the rally from $8,213 (Jan. 24 low).      Momentum is still strong, as suggested by the ascending five- and 10-day averages.      The cryptocurrency could test and possibly break above resistance at $9,586 (Nov. 4 high) and rise toward $10,000 over the next few days.    4-hour chart    The RSI has produced lower highs or bearish divergence on the four-hour chart. As a result, a quick pullback to $9,000 cannot be ruled out before the move into five figures suggested by the daily and weekly charts.      The bias will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above $8,213. The odds of bitcoin falling all the way back to levels below $8,000 are quite low, according to renowned analyst Josh Rager.

Deribit announced this week it would begin offering daily bitcoin index options Feb. 3. Scheduled every day at 08:00 UTC, users will be able to begin trading options at a strike price intervals of $125. Contracts expire two days after being listed.      The exchange will try to offer contracts that move within a 5 percent range around at-the-money (ATM) levels, Deribit's post said. The news gives traders a much wider range of expiry dates, and the platform will now have contracts that expire every day.      ""These short-dated expiries are specifically interesting for investors and traders with a short-term view based on for example macroeconomic data or events,"" the post reads. Deribit's chief communication officer, Luuk Strijers, told CoinDesk the exchange had introduced daily options in response to ""market demand.""    Increasing competition    Launching in 2016, Deribit dominates the cryptocurrency options market. Data from analytics firm Skew shows Deribit options made up nearly 90 percent – approximately $50 million worth – of the total volume traded on Tuesday. In comparison, regulated platform Bakkt made no trades and CME option contracts made up approximately 2 percent of the trading volume.      Regulated bitcoin options have only begun trading in the past couple of months. Bakkt launched options trading just before the holiday season and CME followed suit, launching its options contracts earlier in January. OKEx launched unregulated options contracts on Dec. 26.      The data shows Deribit has remained in pole position and, as the graph below shows, had a record month for volume in December. But the monthly market share has also decreased, falling approximately 10 percent in January.      That coincides with rival options exchanges experiencing month-on-month increases in combined trading volume. Predominantly this appears to be coming from OKEx and CME, as Bakkt reported zero volume on its own platform last week.      Emmanuel Goh, co-founder and CEO of Skew, said he wasn't surprised Deribit's market share was falling to new competitors. The exchange had the first-mover advantage but that was always going to decrease as other companies entered the space. ""Market share falls when you add more exchanges into the mix,"" he said.      OKEx has been able to quickly storm into second place because it has been able to offer new products to its existing client base in Asia. According to Goh, what's important is that ""the pie is still growing,"" with Deribit's volumes rising as part of a much larger increase in the broader crypto options market.      But the introduction of daily options could make Deribit more competitive. Mati Greenspan, the founder of analyst firm Quantum Economics, said adding new products usually helps an exchange broaden its potential client base.      ""Every client is unique and will have different trading styles, strategies and demands from their broker. So having more products helps the provider to satisfy more customers. A good broker will have a tendency to understand their clients' needs and will take them into account when creating new products and services,"" he said.      Like in traditional markets, Strijers said Deribit expects daily options will take up a ""sizable percentage of volumes."" With increasing volatility in January 2020, he added, ""We again see significant month-on-month growth and only expect further growth due to the expansion of tradable options.""

42403921,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdh1hP,1580464800,Third-Party Trackers Are Pulling Your Data Off Ring's Android App,"Ring, the home security company owned by Amazon, promises to watch the world around you and keep your property safe. But the doorbell app is also surveilling its users, sending personally identifiable information out to third-party vendors, according to a new report from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the San Francisco civil liberties nonprofit.      Bill Budington, the senior staff technologist who wrote the report, tested the Ring for Android version 3.21.1 app and found it was sharing data such as users private IP addresses, full names, email address, information about whether bluetooth is enabled and even sensor data from the device being used to access the app.      Budington identified four main companies receiving this information, including Branch, which calls itself a “deep linking” platform (meaning it takes people to specific web pages or products). Facebook also received information such as a person's time zone and was alerted when the app was opened. AppsFlyer, a big data firm, received information such as when users engage with the Neighbors section of the app, as well as what marketplace the app you installed is from and when it was first launched. Mixpanel, a business analytics company that tracks user engagement with apps, received the most identifiable data including the number of locations where a user has Ring devices installed, and user names and emails.        Analytics companies take these discrete forms of data and combine them with other internet user data to create a cohesive picture of device usage.      ""This increases the risk of exposure, since Ring hasn't vetted for the security of these trackers,"" says Budington. ""It also means that unaccountable marketers have access to customer data, and can follow their actions around as they use their mobile devices. It was revealed that a few Ring employees were fired for directly spying on customers and, again, these trackers, whose business model is to follow users, are not subject to the same level of scrutiny.""      This is the most recent in a long line of revelations involving Ring. For example, it partnered with more 400 police departments in sharing device images, accidentally exposed the data of more than 3,000 users including login details and names of Ring devices (which are often labeled with terms like “bedroom”), and created neighborhood-wide panopticons in which neighbors are surveilling neighbors and paying for the privilege to do so.      Considering Amazon has a patent for “surveillance as a service” (delivery drones perform aerial surveillance at the property of an “authorized party”) along with its facial recognition technology, it’s worth considering how services you use to watch the world are also watching you.      Decentralization may provide one option when it come to alternative models that are less exploitative of user data.      ""It's possible to envision a privacy-centric marketing technique that allows users to have targeted ads without a big, centralized database of users information,"" says Budington. ""The Brave browser has experimented with providing these ads via a locally stored database so that you own that data and can clear it when you like. One thing we can be sure of is that the tracking industry isn't interested in these solutions so long as [it] can make big money out of slurping up as much data as [it] can.""

42376235,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwL5ZP,1580459736,USA v. Virgil Griffith: What We Know (and Don’t) in the Bombshell Crypto Sanctions Case,"Prosecutors appear to have a strong case against Virgil Griffith, the ethereum developer charged with conspiring to aid North Korea, legal experts say.  For one thing, the mere act of giving a presentation in Pyongyang might have violated the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) sanctions, depending on what he said there, according to lawyers interviewed by CoinDesk. So could attempting to transfer money between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and another nation, as Griffith allegedly did. It probably won’t help his case if the government proves he traveled to North Korea after the State Department denied him permission, as alleged.  Griffith pleaded not guilty during an arraignment Thursday, which kicks off the next phase of discovery. Prosecutors told a federal judge some documents have already been produced, with more to come. The full amount of evidence they have to support their case has yet to be made public – including any exculpatory evidence that would show Griffith did not violate sanctions restrictions.  The U.S. government takes sanctions “very seriously,” said Stephen Rutenberg, an attorney at the Polsinelli law firm. “It wasn’t like he was going there to play music.”  Griffith’s attorney, Baker Marquart partner Brian Klein, declined to comment for this story, but has previously said Griffith should not have been indicted and that his team “looks forward” to presenting the facts of the case to a jury. Klein is quickly becoming a celebrity lawyer in the crypto and cybersecurity space, successfully representing high-profile clients including Charlie Shrem, Erik Voorhees and EOS’s Block.One, among others.  The case is likely to be one of the most closely watched in crypto history. It’s the first sanctions case in a U.S. court involving cryptocurrency, and comes at a time when the technology’s potential to bypass international restrictions on monetary flows is starting to spook the financial establishment.  For example, former high-level government officials and academics believe a digital currency in some form could help so-called “rogue nations” undermine U.S. global hegemony, as gamed out in November by Harvard Kennedy School in a simulation.  Presumed innocent  Prosecutors secured the indictment on Jan. 8, charging Griffith with conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and adding an unnamed co-conspirator to be charged in the future. The Department of Justice arrested Griffith, an Ethereum Foundation staffer and research scientist, in late November.  So far, U.S. authorities have published a handful of documents related to the case, stating Griffith had been booked on charges of violating two executive orders prohibiting certain transactions and activities in North Korea, as well as some associated legal violations.  While Griffith is perhaps best known for his work on ethereum (he’s long held a reputation as a hacker), the case is not so much a crypto case as it is a national security issue that happens to involve the technology, said Jake Chervinsky, general counsel at Compound Finance.  “It should go without saying that any U.S. citizen who travels to North Korea and advises DPRK officials on how to evade sanctions will be in trouble with the authorities, regardless of whether crypto is involved,” Chervinsky said, though he was quick to add the defense has yet to be presented.  “Although the allegations look bad for Griffith, we should remember that he is entitled to the presumption of innocence and hasn't had the chance to tell his side of the story yet,” Chervinsky said.  Nor is the case about truth, justice or a moral crusade, said Danforth Newcomb, an attorney with law firm Shearman & Sterling with a background in litigation and sanctions. In his view, the case boils down to “the enforcement community’s understanding of the regulations,” which Griffith’s alleged actions violated.  ‘Exporting services’  Executive order 13722, signed by President Barack Obama in 2016, prohibits U.S. persons from exporting services to North Korea.  “The facts, as reported in the press, pretty clearly looks like an exported service, and I suspect in that interview he is reported to have given to the FBI he admitted to facts that amount to exporting services,” Newcomb said of Griffith.  U.S. citizens are U.S. persons, even when on foreign soil, he noted.  The complaint further adds that “Griffith began formulating plans to facilitate the exchange of [an unspecified cryptocurrency] between the DPRK and South Korea,” acknowledging this would violate U.S. sanctions and yet still expressing a desire to return to North Korea.  Even if Griffith did not intend to conduct the transaction himself, simply showing the North Koreans how to do so would also violate OFAC regulations, Newcomb said.  “In OFAC regulations there is a facilitation concept which says that a U.S. person can’t facilitate a transaction or activity that U.S. persons can’t do themselves,” he said. This could, for example, include telling a citizen of some other nation how to give a presentation on fintech in North Korea, which the complaint alleges Griffith did (though at least one witness to the conference claims that sanctions never came up).     Public knowledge?  Griffith could see a few different issues in fighting the case, should he not arrange a plea bargain.  Newcomb said there are few precedents that have successfully challenged OFAC in court, while Chervinsky noted national security offenses have “a significant amount” of precedential cases.  Griffith might claim everything he discussed during his presentation is public material. The Berman amendment to the IEEPA prevents OFAC from restricting informational materials in the public domain from being bought or sold within sanctioned nations.  But this argument may not hold up in court, Newcomb said.  “I think it will be OFAC’s position that it is irrelevant whether what he discussed in North Korea was open source or not,” Newcomb said.  The DOJ has been prosecuting national security cases for decades, Chervinsky noted. In recent years, the DOJ has even had a specific group – the National Security Division – responsible for such cases.  “The law applies equally regardless of the type of financial tool that a defendant uses to violate national security laws,” he said.  Missing information  While the indictment handed down on Jan. 9 reiterates the government’s allegations in the matter, it is largely unclear what specifically Griffith said during his speech and what information he shared with the North Korean government, Rutenberg said.  There is a difference between helping the government evade sanctions and just providing some basic, general information about blockchains.  Griffith’s conversations with the FBI may also have an impact, at least theoretically, Rutenberg said.  While Griffith was arrested in California, he was transferred to the Southern District of New York late last month.  He was released on bail. While he has so far physically appeared in at least one of his hearings in New York, he now resides at his parents’ home in Alabama.

These pairs can now be traded with initial equity of as low as 20 percent, giving traders a maximum of up to five times leverage, according to a press release by Bitfinex.      Margin trading enables traders to borrow funds to increase leverage, offering the potential for greater profits than in traditional trading. However, the potential for greater rewards also comes with amplified levels of risk.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said in a press release that Clark, who was known online as ""Plural of Mongoose,"" ""Variety Jones,"" ""VJ"" and ""cimon,"" pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and will be sentenced on May 29.      Clark was first charged with conspiracy to traffic narcotics and conspiracy to launder money in 2015. Prosecutors described him as a ""senior advisor"" to the platform at the time.      Silk Road is most famous for being a darknet marketplace where users could purchase illicit drugs and other goods using bitcoin as a payment method. Ulbricht is currently serving a life sentence in connection with his operation of the site, stemming from charges of narcotics distribution, computer hacking and conspiracy.      Ulbricht and Clark were both also accused of facilitating ""the attempted killing of a co-conspirator,"" though neither was charged in connection with this allegation.
