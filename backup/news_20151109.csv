42378357,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1VD,1447109122,Bitcoin Startup Bitwage Joins Telecom Giant Orange's Incubator,"Bitcoin payroll service Bitwage is joining six other startups as part of an incubator backed by French telecom giant Orange SA.  The startups represent the fifth class of startups included in the Orange Fab incubator, which began operations in 2013. Companies that take part in Orange’s incubator, according to the firm’s 5th November announcement, will work with mentors, receive hands-on training and conduct business out of a San Francisco workspace owned by Orange Silicon Valley (OSV), the telecom’s US-based outfit.  Bloomberg reported earlier this year that Orange was looking to invest in bitcoin startups. It later joined Chain's $30m Series A funding round.  Bitwage  founder and president Jonathan Chester told CoinDesk that his team has been working out of the San Francisco space since September. He traced Bitwage’s involvement with Orange back to a local gathering in June, when he appeared on a panel hosted by OSV.  This connection led to further discussions with OSV, which is conducting an internal blockchain initiative dubbed ChainForce.  Chester explained:  ""We actually did not go the normal route. The normal route is to apply, get judged internally by various analysts, come in for a pitch to a bunch of judges, get judged by Orange partners, then the decision is made. We skipped the first three steps since we already had a strong relationship with the blockchain innovation teams.""  Orange did not immediately respond to comment. However, in a statement accompanying the announcement, Pierre Louette, deputy CEO and secretary-general for digital investments at Orange, said that its incubator program positions the company to take advantage of new technology trends.  ""By collaborating with startups, our goal is to anticipate future trends in the digital industry, whether it be the development of innovative technologies or new business models,"" he said.

42378356,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1Tx,1447105876,"Bitcoin Exchange itBit Wins 10,000 BTC in US Government Auction","New York-based bitcoin exchange itBit has revealed it successfully secured five auction blocks as part of last week's bitcoin auction overseen by the US Marshals Service (USMS).  The event saw the government agency oversee the sale of 44,000 BTC (valued at $16.6m at press time) on the open market, with each auction block consisting of 2,000 BTC or more.  Bobby Cho, Director of Trading at itBit, told CoinDesk:  ""We confirm that itBit's auction bid, organized on behalf of a syndicate of our exchange and OTC trading clients, won five blocks in the final USMS auction.""  The exchange had originally declined to comment on its involvement in the auction, which drew a total of 11 bidders. Still, the announcement marks the second time itBit has secured bitcoins as part of a USMS auction, following its purchase of 3,000 BTC at an auction in March.  The USMS told CoinDesk today that the earliest participants in last week’s public auction could announce they successfully or unsuccessfully secured bitcoins as part of the sale would be tomorrow, stating that undisclosed events had caused transactions to be delayed.  However, at press time, details were emerging about the auction, the fourth in a series that has seen the sale of roughly 175,000 BTC confiscated during the investigation into online black market Silk Road.  Digital Currency Group subsidiary Genesis Trading, for example, informed CoinDesk that it did not successfully secure any bitcoins as part of the sale. Binary Financial, another publicly identified participant, did not respond to requests for further information as of press time.  In the meantime, Reddit users have already begun to speculate as to the results, with evidence emerging that as many as three participants successfully purchased bitcoins as part of the sale.

42378355,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1WT,1447103449,HSBC: Blockchain Tech Could Complement Central Bank Policies,"UK banking group HSBC has outlined how it believes the blockchain could be used to facilitate or enhance unconventional central bank policies.  Business Insider reports that, according to a draft document it obtained, HSBS is discussing the idea that central banks could push for blockchain-based digital currency systems in order to capitalize on transaction transparency and create a clearer picture of a country's financial system.  That information could then be used to conduct so-called ""helicopter drops"" – targeted cash injections into the real economy via consumer bank account deposits or tax refunds.  Supporters of the concept say that the money would move into the real economy faster compared to the private credit sector route, a move economist Milton Friedman famously compared to flying over a town and dropping bills from a helicopter.  As BI quotes the HSBC document:  ""If we move towards an economy where all transactions become recorded in real-time on a blockchain type of technology, it will not be too dissimilar to the current eco-systems that many e-commerce giants have around the globe.""  ""Online e-commerce stores are able to give out loans to merchants without collateral, because they know all the flows already from the merchants' point of view: from how much people are spending to the conversion rate of pages viewed to purchases,"" the HSBC note continues. ""In the same way, a modernised monetary transmission system, based on real-time big data analysis through blockchain, could allow the government to balance the economy more efficiently and systematically.""  In theory, this transparency could give a central bank the ability to tailor how much cash it wants to inject into an economy at a given time. BI notes that part of the problem is that too much cash added to the public money supply could kickstart inflationary issues.  ""HSBC outlines the trust problem with helicopter money — in short, people are rightly skeptical of a central bank's ability to work out how much help the economy actually needs,"" BI reports. ""If it's too much, helicopter money could be wildly inflationary.""  A representative for the bank was not immediately available for comment.

42378358,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1Xj,1447097418,Japanese Trade Ministry Exploring Blockchain Tech in Study Group,"Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has been discussing the potential impact of blockchain technology on its domestic finance industry, new documents reveal.  According to notes from the 16th October meeting of METI’s FinTech study group, the government agency has become aware of the increasing interest in the blockchain and distributed ledgers in the US as part of a wider inquiry into financial technology.  METI’s latest meeting minutes reveal there was broad opinion among meeting participants that blockchain technology could “impact the whole financial industry”, stating:  “The impact of blockchain is huge. Its importance is similar to the emergence of Internet and Google.”  The document goes on to note those at the meeting suggested blockchain technology could reduce costs significantly for financial institutions.  Still, the meeting saw METI weigh both sides of the ongoing conversation surrounding the technology, as the potential safety concerns of such systems were also discussed.  “For example, at present concerns in reputation and money laundering remain in bitcoin trading,” the minutes read.  Though a full list of attendees is not available on METI's website, participants in the group’s inaugural 6th October meeting included representatives from major financial firms that have already voiced interest in the emerging technology.  These included Accenture, Deloitte, Mizuho Financial Group and Nomura Research Institute. One member from the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, was also in present at the meeting.

42378331,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7hyV1,1447090377,"Brazilian University Accepts Bitcoin, Installs Campus ATM","Faculty of Informatics and Management Paulista (FIAP), a São Paulo-based private university, has announced it will now accept bitcoin as payment for select courses.  FIAP will begin accepting bitcoin for tuition payments on classes taken as part of its Shift program, which offers shorter courses on entrepreneurship, innovation, project management and technology.  Local bitcoin payments processor PagCoin will serve as the payments processor for the initiative.  Professor of e-learning Rubim Leandro said he believes adding bitcoin as a payment method will further cement FIAP's standing as a local leader in technology.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We believe bitcoin is a new way for students to make payments, and we need to be into this kind of experimentation in Brazil. We work with technology, we learn technology, so you want to be the first one in Brazil to teach about the technology and to use bitcoin.""  As part of its broader plan to embrace the technology, FIAP is now offering a six-module course entitled ""Bitcoin - A Revolução do Dinheiro"" and opening a bitcoin ATM on campus.  Course details  Professor Leandro explained that the class is not a full semester course, but will rather be held on weekends, offering additional credit to anyone interested in learning about the technology.  Module topics will cover the difference between bitcoin and other payment methods; bitcoin's impact on financial markets; and how students can buy and transact in bitcoin, among other topics.  As part of the course, students will also be able to partake in hands-on learning, according to Leandro.  ""The students will receive some bitcoins they can use to buy a course or to change for [Brazilian] reals and so on,"" he added.  Bitcoin ATM added  FIAP will join a growing number of international universities including Spain's Pompeu Fabra University, Canada's Simon Fraser University and MIT in the US which have also installed bitcoin ATMs as a means to introduce students to the technology.  The bitcoin ATM unit will be supplied by bitcoin services startup CoinBR for free to the university, with Pagcoin taking a 1% fee on transactions.    The unit will be available at FIAP's Paulista campus, which is dedicated to MBA courses.

42378343,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7hygL,1447083352,Poll: 48% Believe Bitcoin Will Be Worth Over $500 by 2016,"Bitcoin enthusiasts are once again bullish on the digital currency's price potential.  A new CoinDesk poll has found that 48% of respondents believe that bitcoin will end the year valued at more than $500.  That's not to say that others weren't more bearish.  Some 38.7% of bitcoin enthusiasts think the digital currency's price will end 2015 at or near its current levels, with 4,370 of the 11,293 respondents predicting that bitcoin would be valued at between $351–$500 by this time.  Thirty-three percent of those surveyed think that the digital currency's price would rise to $501–$1,000 by 31st December, 2015. This was followed by the the $201–$350 category, which received 10.6% of the votes.  All price predictions can be seen in the pie chart below:      Bitcoin Price Poll Results    Create pie charts      The poll further sought clarity as to how the market had perceived the recent increase in the price of bitcoin.  Most respondents (27.4%) said they did not know what had caused the price movemenet, however, 26.3% of readers attributed the digital currency's surge last week to capital controls in China.  Roughly 20% of those surveyed believed the increase was due to recent positive news coverage on the industry, which has highlighted the rising number of major global financial institutions interested in the technology.  Ten percent of survey takers thought the price increase was linked to the European Court of Justice's ruling that bitcoin was exempt from value-added tax (VAT), which has been widely seen as a recognition of its use case as a currency.  Elsewhere, notable percentages of respondents linked the value rise to investment announcements in industry companies and the launch of New York-based bitcoin exchange Gemini, which is backed by founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.
