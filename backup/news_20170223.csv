42427402,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKKMhh,1487887874,Bitcoin Price Sets New All-Time High,"The price of bitcoin has reached a new all-time high.  Bitcoin prices hit a high of $1,172.09, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) – surpassing a level first set more than three years ago in November 2013, when the BPI reported an average price high of $1,165.89.  The move followed a morning of price gains, coming amid the longest period ever in which bitcoin's value has stayed above $1,000.  Prices first began to inch upward today at 9:00 UTC on Wednesday, with bitcoin prices reaching a high of $1,100, staying above that level since. Today's price high represents an increase of more than 4% since the start of the day's trading.  At press time, the average price of bitcoin is $1,170.72, BPI data shows.  A number of factors have buoyed prices – and positive trader sentiment – in recent weeks.  Perhaps most notably, traders have taken a largely bullish tack on the prospects that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the first-ever bitcoin ETF. The SEC has a deadline of 11th March to make their final decision, which has already been subject to delays.  The surge past the all-time high also follows a period of uncertainty and change within the global bitcoin market.  January's defining markets storyline was the growing involvement of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, in the domestic bitcoin exchange space. A warning issued to exchanges led to the imposition of trading fees and, later, withdrawal delays at China's leading bourses.  That month opened with a push above the $1,000 line, though the days to follow would see a dramatic fall back below that figure.

42379264,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uWJ9,1487881158,The Code for This Bitcoin Node Scanner is Now Open Source,"CoinScope, a tool that provides aggregated data about bitcoin nodes, has been made open source.  The code was made publicly available on GitHub on 22nd February. The project, which has been around since 2015, is somewhat akin to Bitnodes, the node data tool operated by startup 21 Inc that seeks to map the bitcoin network by measuring the amount of nodes connected at any given time.  As detailed in a 2015 presentation by developer Andrew Miller at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Montreal, the tool's aim isn't to reduce the anonymity of nodes on the network. Rather, according to Miller, CoinScope's purpose is to provide a vehicle to assess the health of the network itself.  The white paper  drafted in connection with CoinScope describes how one using the tool can see the bitcoin network in a new way by uncovering relationships between nodes and mining pools – a process that yields intriguing data points about the network's composition.  The paper notes:  ""We introduce a ""decloaking"" method to find influential nodes in the topology that are well connected to a mining pool. Our results find that in contrast to bitcoin's idealized vision of spreading mining responsibility to each node, mining pools are prevalent and hidden: roughly 2% of the (influential) nodes represent three-quarters of the mining power.""  The main technological aspect that makes the decloaking possible through the CoinScope tool is an element dubbed AddressNode. It works by discovering peer-to-peer links in bitcoin, then applying those links to the live topology of the whole network.

Legislators in the House's Committee on Finance unanimously passed unamended House Bill 1481 in a vote on 22nd February. HB 1481 makes its way to the Hawaii Senate next.  The proposal requires input from leaders in various business sectors including cybersecurity, real estate, tourism, transportation, retail and even marijuana. At least three blockchain experts will also sit on the panel.  The state has outlined various use cases to be studied by the working group. Chief among them are using blockchain for identity and access management, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing and tourism.  The bill states:  ""The legislature recognizes the vast potential for this technology to drastically change and improve public sector operations and private industry capabilities. The legislature finds that highly innovative technologies such as blockchain require an educated and measured approach so that regulations do not stymie innovation and growth in this State.""

According to a blog post from project partner Tech Bureau today, the new trial finds Hitachi exploring how blockchain could be incorporated into its 'PointInfinity' program, a product launched in 2006 that enables its merchants to incentivize and collect data on avid customers.  The test began on 9th February, and will progress with the goal of determining whether a private blockchain could meet the demands of a high-volume transaction system, the post said.  In statements, Tech Bureau CEO Takao Asayama said that he believes the trial could help boost the perception of what he believes could be a powerful use case in Japan, one that he believes appeals to customers and corporates.  Asayama told CoinDesk:  ""Since our Mijin blockchain has been tested by banks and other financial services, and proven that it can be applied for ledger systems, Hitachi decided to test our mijin to use it as a ledger engine for their own product.""  Asayama went on to project that the use of a blockchain as a distribution mechanism for rewards points could yield big results for enterprise users.    ""Our blockchain would help their product to reduce its running cost by over 90%,"" he said.  For Hitachi, the move marks its latest foray into the industry, following its 2016 announcement that it would explore blockchain applications for its various business lines.  Since then, Hitachi has teamed with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ on a blockchain e-check trial.  For Tech Bureau, this marks the firm's latest enterprise partnership following its $6.5m funding Series A in 2016. The Osaka-based startup oversees a cryptocurrency exchange (Zaif) permissioned blockchain platform (Mijin), aimed at enterprise markets.

Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins moderated a panel earlier this week at an event hosted by the Competition Bureau, an independent law enforcement agency based in Canada. During that session, according to Reuters, Wilkins touched on Project Jasper, a blockchain initiative aimed at creating a wholesale payment settlement system.  According to Wilkins, the Bank of Canada would consider similar undertakings in the future.  She told event attendees:  ""Project Jasper (is) something new for the Bank of Canada and it is one of the most productive experiments that we've had. We're certainly open to doing more of that.""  Canada’s central bank began work on the so-called CAD-coin project last year. Some of the other firms that were involved in the trial include Bank of Montreal, CIBC, Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank and TD Bank. R3, the startup behind the distributed ledger consortium, also took part in the trial.  Wilkins wrote in an op-ed for CoinDesk earlier this month that Project Jasper enabled the central bank to learn key lessons about the tech.  She intimated that the initiative would continue, stating that the Bank of Canada’s blockchain team would develop a follow-up iteration that addresses ""gaps"" in the original version.

42379231,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uWGd,1487860207,"Mizuho Completes Blockchain Recordkeeping, Digital Currency Trials","Japanese banking group Mizuho announced today the completion of two new blockchain trials.  Conducted in partnership with professional services firm Cognizant, the tests saw the bank develop its own digital currency, as well as a system for sharing documents across national borders.  Mizuho first announced that it was developing a blockchain-based system for record-keeping in February of last year. The bank has also trialed prototypes for syndicated loan issuance, and is a member of the R3 distributed ledger consortium.  The second test involved Mizuho sending transactions, denominated in a newly created digital currency, between its subsidiaries. Mizuho explained that it sought to test “whether a business process as robust as the traditional centralized system can be built at a lower cost”.  According to statements, the bank said that both trials were successful, though it stopped short of saying whether it would push any of the solutions developed to commercial scale.  Mizuho went on to say:  “The solution successfully confirmed that a tamper-proof distributed database, one of the key features of blockchain technology, can be leveraged to create an effective platform for information sharing among multiple group companies, resulting in potential cost savings and enhanced usability.”  The bank indicated that it would continue to iterate on the projects it developed, particularly from the perspective of data storage, which it cited as a high priority for future tests.  “Addressing the need to store and manage large volumes of data using blockchain will be among the next objectives of the initiative,” the bank said.

42379224,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uW5J,1487858346,Blockchain Startup Storj Targets Enterprise Cloud With $3 Million Raise,"What started out as a blockchain-powered, decentralized Dropbox has evolved into an enterprise storage system with real venture capital backing.  Atlanta-based Storj Labs announced today it has raised $3m in seed funding as part of a round that saw contributions from individual investors employed by VC firms including Google Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures and Techstars, according to the company.  The funding marks the first time that Storj Labs has raised outside capital, following a blockchain token sale in 2014.  The funding is also notable for a startup that counts itself among an early set of firms working in the so-called 'crypto 2.0' space, the early movement aimed at applying blockchain technology to non-financial applications and use cases.  In this light, CEO Shawn Wilkinson said the funding marks the end of a long run of experimentation that has seen the company, now 13 employees strong, iterate a fledgling idea into one that can now leverage experimental technology to secure corporate partnerships.  Wilkinson told CoinDesk:  ""We went from: 'Cryptocurrency is cool,' to 'Hey, it's useful, but it's a lot better if we abstract parts of our service.' Now, customers just buy space through our network and we help them do that.""  More concretely, the funding will help Storj continue to build out its peer-to-peer file storage marketplace to support more partners the size of cable provider Cox Communications, which inked a deal with the startup in December of last year.  Storj's technology works by enabling an open network of users to provide data hosting to its clients via a blockchain – a service that the startup then sells to clients like Cox using a traditional software-as-a-service (or SaaS) model.  Participants in the network then earn a digital token called 'storjcoin' (SJCX) for offering their computers and storage capacity.  Token past  Yet, while Storj has pursued a more traditional path toward venture investment, it was also one of the first to seek to raise funds by leveraging the ability of blockchains to offer a distribution mechanism for provably scarce digital code.  An early adopter of the so-called 'initial coin offering' or 'ICO' model, Storj initially funded its ideas by selling Storjcoin X (SJCX), a digital asset it used to raise $460,000 and that today has a market capitalization of $6.49m, Coinmarketcap data shows.  But while the startup's services are tied to the voluntary public community that finds value in this code, Wilkinson said he isn't worried about the ability of his SaaS offering to scale.  Going forward, Wilkinson said that Storj plans to focus on more platform integrations, making its service more widely available and bringing more value to participants.  For instance, Storj recently revealed that its technology now works on web browsers, and in December, it added its tools to the cloud application platform Heroku – both ways that the company is aiming to expand its audience.  The use of an open network, however, creates some interesting dynamics, Wilkinson acknowledged. Although, he argues that his company has succeeded by managing them and offering value-added services that could only be created through the use of a blockchain.  ""We came to the conclusion in 2015 that that's really powerful, having an open market for the storage,"" he explained.  In this way, Wilkinson believes Storj has found its value proposition in a market where many have struggled, adding:    ""If you want to use the data storage platform, the purpose of our company is to abstract the difficulties.""

42379234,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uWKP,1487854820,Faster Than Lightning? 'Sprite' Paper Envisions New Bitcoin Payments,"Announced in early 2015, the Lightning Network, has been heralded as a promising solution to bitcoin's scaling challenges – one that, over the past year, has been inching closer to launch.  However, a new paper has laid out the framework for another payment system that researchers claim would be even faster.  Payment channels such as those proposed by the Lightning Network are one strand of the debate over scaling bitcoin which, although it often takes the form of arguments over block size, is ultimately about the volume of transactions the network can handle in a given length of time.  Larger block size is one way to improve transaction volume, but another strategy is to conduct payments 'off-chain', that is, in private payment channels between two or more parties where only the final balance is broadcast back to the main blockchain.  The authors of the new paper, titled ""Sprites: Payment Channels that Go Faster than Lightning"", claim that the Lightning Network's design is ""more complicated than necessary"" and assert that Sprite channels can reduce the maximum transaction time taken when each link in the transaction path suffers from a worst-case delay.  Stop and go  The idea of designing for worst-case scenarios is key to the Sprite proposal, which comes into its own in conditions such as disputes between parties in a payment channel.  Andrew Miller, assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and co-author of the paper, said:  ""In the case of a dispute ... the amount of time you might have to wait before getting the money back is determined by a timelock. In Lightning and Raiden, that timelock is longer the longer your payment path is. We've found a way of doing chained payments across multiple channels in a way that means the timelock is the same length regardless of how long the path is.""  Since the Lightning Network explicitly aims to facilitate cross-channel payments between parties who don't have a direct channel set up between them, a strategy to mitigate these kind of delays could be a significant advantage.  Soft fork barrier  However, for the time being, the mechanism needed to implement the Sprite micropayment channels makes use of functions that cannot currently be executed in bitcoin script (but could be run on the ethereum blockchain).  That means that implementing the system on the bitcoin network would require a soft fork to add new codes to the script, just as other proposals such as SegWit would do.  ""It's straightforward to imagine how a soft fork to support this behavior would go, but at the moment that's not a soft fork that's been proposed yet,"" Miller said.  Still, with the paper now released, he did point out the possibility of other researchers finding a way to implement the Sprites system without requiring an extension to the bitcoin script.  Meanwhile, Miller confirmed that the authors of the paper are already in contact with the Lightning team, who have been providing feedback and analysis of the proposal.  At the same time, they have hopes that the Raiden network (the ethereum equivalent of Lightning) will be able to incorporate the Sprite technique in the near future.  Patrick McCorry, co-author of the Sprites paper and cryptocurrency researcher at Newcastle University, said:  ""I'd be surprised if Raiden didn't implement this proposal: they won't have to deal with backwards compatibility issues [compared to bitcoin], so it's more likely they'll be able to do it because there's no soft fork requirement.""  In a final comment, Miller voiced the opinion that developing solutions for bitcoin first and then porting out to other crytocurrencies could hinder progress, since researchers have to contend with the quirks of bitcoin code.  ""Our recommendation is that people try to express new ideas in either simple abstractions like pseudo code, or in ethereum because it's an easier example of what's possible, and then do the backward compatibility to fit with bitcoin today,"" he said, adding:  ""If payment channels were invented for ethereum first, I think they would have immediately seen [our] way of doing it.""

In a new blog post, the team behind the blockchain protocol, launched in late 2016, outline plans for upgraded functionality of zcash that focuses on integrating new innovations into the protocol.  Planned changes include a payment disclosure feature, perhaps best described as a means by which information can be embedded into the blockchain in such a way that only the parties involved in the transaction can view it.  Furthermore, inter-blockchain transactions involving popular public chains like bitcoin and ethereum will become available through a feature called XCAT (Cross-Chain Atomic Transactions).  Once implemented, the new protocol will allow for the issuance of zcash tokens – similar to ethereum tokens but with the network's advertised anonymity advances.

42379238,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uWOB,1487841808,Bitcoin Price Surges to Within $30 of All-Time High,"The price of bitcoin has surged overnight, closing in on its all-time high set back in 2013.  Immediately prior to reporting, global average prices had reached a high for the session of around $1,137, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Notably, that figure is less than $30 below the maximum ever value of $1,165.89 set on 30th November, 2013.  The latest increase comes soon after bitcoin's longest ever period at over $1,000, and a notable period of volatility in recent months.  The highs also reflect confidence by traders and investors in an industry that has been somewhat rocked by moves by the Chinese central bank to restrict the actions of the country's bitcoin exchanges, causing a number of them to temporarily freeze withdrawals of the cryptocurrency in recent weeks.  Also lurking in the background, and possibly having an influence on price, is the imminent SEC decision on the Winklevoss brothers' bitcoin ETF – an event some experts have told CoinDesk that traders are already 'pricing in' a potential approval.  The 11th March ruling could see the approval of the first bitcoin ETF in the US market, opening the digital currency to a wider audience of investors.
