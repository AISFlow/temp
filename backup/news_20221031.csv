42415118,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXQcH,1667259226,Coinbase Files to Support Ripple Against SEC Case,"Crypto exchange Coinbase has petitioned a federal court for permission to file a friend of the court (""amicus"") brief in the ongoing lawsuit between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs.  Coinbase joins the Blockchain Association, an industry lobbyist group, SpendTheBits, a crypto payments app that uses XRP and John Deaton, a lawyer, in hoping to shore up Ripple's case against the SEC, which sued Ripple at the end of 2020 on allegations it sold XRP as an unregistered security.  The exchange highlighted whether the SEC provided ""fair notice"" prior to bringing its enforcement action, taking a dig at the common industry complaint that the regulator has not provided clear guidance to businesses in the process.  ""Given the absence of SEC rulemaking for the cryptocurrency industry, the question of whether the SEC has given fair notice before bringing an enforcement action against sales of one of the thousands of unique digital assets will often be highly fact-intensive, which makes it particularly ill-suited for adjudication on summary judgment,"" Coinbase's filing said.  Coinbase similarly argued that the SEC has been inconsistent about its enforcement approach, which creates ""uncertainty"" for companies in the sector.  Read More: SEC, Ripple Call for Immediate Ruling in Suit Over Whether XRP Sales Violated Securities Laws  ""Ripple and others have been the subject of extensive enforcement scrutiny while others – with nearly identical products or services – have apparently been subject to none,"" the filing said.  Much of the filing focuses on this argument, as well as maintaining the view that the regulator has not engaged in any rulemaking that would ""provide the regulatory clarity"" companies want.  The filing also targeted the argument that crypto could be treated like traditional securities, saying most cryptocurrencies do not represent ownership stakes or pay dividends the way shares might.  ""In addition, existing SEC registration requirements for national securities exchanges are currently unsuitable to the way digital asset platforms operate,"" the filing said. ""Existing SEC requirements, however, only allow broker-dealers to be members of registered securities exchanges, meaning that retail customers can only trade assets on exchanges indirectly by using the services of broker-dealers that charge transaction fees and add intermediation risks that could be avoided on digital asset trading platforms, again to the benefit of customers.""",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/31/coinbase-files-to-support-ripple-against-sec-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f6cd40a14561d28d125f3159852fd38004bf5e4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42415127,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXR87,1667259064,‘Rick and Morty’ Co-Creator’s NFT Collection Sees $14M in Trade Volume Hours After Mint,"Another day, another buzzy non-fungible token (NFT) mint – this time for Art Gobblers, a collection created by television director and voice actor Justin Roiland with backing from Web3 venture firm Paradigm.  Roiland is the co-creator of the animated comedy show ""Rick and Morty,"" which is especially popular among the crypto-native crowd. The collection, which was free to mint, has so far seen over 9,600 ETH (around $15 million) in trade volume since minting hours ago on Monday night, according to data from new NFT marketplace Blur.  Art Gobblers’ stated goal is to create a “decentralized art factory” using a combination of NFTs, a GOO token and community collaboration.  How it works  Each of the collection’s 2,000 NFTs are meant to function as own on-chain, transferrable art galleries. Owners of the NFTs can “digest” artwork created on the project’s website to add to their “art bellies,” which become curated collections that are also transferable.  Art can be minted using an ERC-20 token called GOO, which is earned by holding Gobblers. The tokenomics get a bit complex – after earning GOO, holders can create “Pages,” which are NFTs that act as blank canvases to either digest, trade or “glaminate” with custom artwork.  The art reveal for the NFTs is slated for Tuesday, but holders and non-holders can create off-chain art on the project’s website as a preview of what’s to come.  At the time of writing, the collection has an impressive 11 ETH (around $17,000) floor price, according to aggregated data from Blur’s NFT marketplace. The collection has a royalty rate of 6.9%, and just under half of buyers are bypassing the royalty fee by using royalty-optional marketplaces like Blur and X2Y2.  In less than one day of trading, the collection is already in the top 10 for October sales volume, according to data from OpenSea.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/31/rick-and-morty-co-creators-nft-collection-sees-14m-in-trade-volume-hours-after-mint,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe26084a3a48421726374d2c21bb057c923891c1-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SLNHP's current yield can outperform most yields from altcoins (riskier than Bitcoin) staking at major crypto exchanges and DeFi yield-farming protocol while providing Bitcoin-level safety. SLNPH's 3-year total expected yield (525%) rivals Bitcoin's capital gain (575%) from reaching $115,000 per BTC in 3 years even without additional SLNPH capital gains. Despite SLNH being unprofitable, SLNH is still operating cash flow positive and any missed dividend payouts will be accrued and paid back in full in future. SLNHP is less risky than SLNH yet could match SLNH in upside potential due to priority over assets in case of bankrupt (1.5 adjusted Price-to-Book ratio) and potential common-convertibility. Introduction Based on our coverages of Soluna Holdings ( SLNH ) so far, we categorized SLNH under companies with compelling stories but are not compelling investments. SLNH sells investors a means to earn a return by solving curtailed renewable energy. SLNH solves curtailed energy by building facilities around sites with curtailed energy. This is beneficial to both SLNH and the energy provider. SLNH would get energy supply at lower prices while the energy provider can ensure demand at full capacity. In an early study, our findings suggest that the primary threat to SLNH's business model is the increasing resources invested to solve curtailed energy in a move away from non-renewable energy. This impact is 2-fold: less curtailment implies less opportunity for SLNH; Less curtailment also implies higher energy prices and lower SLNH profitability. We also argued that SLNH could potentially have a conflict of interest against the general public where energy costs could've been lower or that the energy could've been used for other productive purposes. In a recent coverage , we expanded our initial thesis and found several more pieces of evidence suggesting limited upside: Over-centralization: 60% of mining operations by Q4 (90% in the longer run) will be centralized in Texas, a state known to suffer from frequent blackouts and near blackouts. Mining is not one of the lowest as claimed where the cost of revenue (mining, excluding depreciation) is at the industry-average level while all-in business cost is 2x the industry average. Lack of mining capacity and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) reserves to materially take advantage of an upcoming Bitcoin recovery phase and bull market. Heavily burdened with 9% preferred dividends at $25 liquidation on 3mil outstanding preferred shares. In short, we think that the main benefit SLNH investors can derive from a recovering Bitcoin is not the massive upside but only a lower risk of insolvency. That's why we maintain our verdict that there isn't sufficient value proposition in investing in SLNH. Apparently, there is a way to benefit from SLNH's lower insolvency risk without forgoing very high returns. And that is by investing in SLNH Preferred Shares ( SLNHP ). DeFi-level Yield With Bitcoin-Level Risks Decentralized Finance is known to provide speculators with extremely high yields from staking where annual yield commonly exceeds 100%. The problem with this staking is that staking yields are usually paid in the form of another token with very little utility. The lack of utility implies less demand for the token and the token price often eventually collapses, tanking the yield with it. In contrast, yields that are paid in well-established coins/tokens have much lesser yield. On the other hand, SLNHP is a 9% cumulative Series A perpetual preferred shares of $0.001 par value and $25 liquidation price. The 9% dividends are paid on the $25 liquidation price which equates to $0.1875 (= $25 *9% / 12 months). These dividend payouts have continued through 2022 till September with October's still pending. At the time of writing, SLNPH is trading at $4.08, implying a monthly yield of 4.6% or 71.5% annual yield compounded monthly. This yield is respectable and even higher than most yields at DeFi's biggest yield-farming protocols (PancakeSwap ( CAKE-USD ), Aave ( AAVE-USD ), Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) or pure staking at Binance ( BNB-USD ) and other major exchanges such as Crypto.com ( CRO-USD ), KuCoin ( KCS-USD ), and Huobi ( HT-USD ). Is this yield too good to be true? No, this high yield is required due to the riskiness involved in investing in SLNH. From our perspective, SLNH's primary risk is insolvency. On the basis of per BTC, SLNH's all-in business expense is equivalent to $74,000 per BTC mined ( more than 2x industry average). With Bitcoin trading near $20,000, SLNH is suffering $50,000 per BTC mined. SLNH hasn't halted operation because Bitcoin is still trading above the cost of revenue (mining, excluding depreciation). As mentioned above, SLNH's cost of mining (excluding depreciation) is only industry-average at best, which is $13,000 to $14,000 per BTC. Should Bitcoin follow through with its final leg down to $10,000 as depicted by its halving cycle, SLNH will need to halt mining operations, hence the insolvency risks. Therefore, SLNHP is by no means a safe investment, just Bitcoin-level safe (which is risky by general definition). But in terms of cryptocurrency and DeFi yield farming, Bitcoin is the safest. SLNHP's dividend yield with Bitcoin-level safety is very respectable. We perceive SLNPH to be the safest because we perceived Bitcoin to be the safest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is the first and has been around the longest. Moreover, investors can lock in this level of yield perpetually as long as Bitcoin trades just above SLNH's breakeven cost per BTC. Bitcoin doesn't even need to ""go to the moon"". Based on our long-standing Bitcoin thesis [ 1 ][ 2 ], we (base case) expect Bitcoin to hit $10,000 by November before spending the following 2 years (2023-2024) reclaiming its $70,000 all-time highs and eventually $115,000 during the subsequent 1-year bull market (2025). At $115,000 per BTC by 2025, Bitcoin will return 575% in 3 years or 158% annually. During the same period, SLNHP will yield 134% annually compounded monthly (= [1.046^36 -1] / 3 years), very similar to our 3-year Bitcoin base case even without any capital gains. If SLNHP were to reclaim its liquidation price, SLNPH would return an additional 525% (=$25/$4-1) over however long it takes. There are also other drivers for lowering SLNHP's risk. In terms of cash flow, SLNH is still operating cash flow positively despite being unprofitable. In the case of dividend misses, SLNPH is cumulative, meaning all previously unpaid (missed) monthly dividends are accrued and must be paid back in full in the future. Under the worst-case scenario (bankruptcy), preferred shareholders have priority over common shareholders upon asset liquidations. This is very important because SLNH's book value may be overestimated (valuation of intangible assets, asset liquidation liquidity, underestimation of asset deprecation, etc.). SLNH is now trading at a 0.15 Price-to-Book ('PB') ratio, which provides a good margin of safety under a worst-case scenario. To be even more conservative, we'll reduce fixed asset values (PP&E and Prepaids) by 50% (to reflect liquidation liquidity challenges and risk of underestimating depreciation) and exclude non-tangible assets (which contributed 28% of total assets and might be realizable as cash). These conservative measures bring up the PB ratio to 1.5 (=$18.32mil Market Cap / [$4.63mil cash + $87mil PP&E * 50% + $10.7mil Prepaid * 50% - $41.4mil Total Liability]). This implies priority over assets during liquidation is very important. Under the best-case scenario, SLNHP shareholders might be able to convert SLNHP to SLNH shares in the future. We think that this is the best of both worlds. Fig 1. SLNH is operating cash flow positive (YCharts) Conclusion: Yield Or Call Options? Is there a better dividend income opportunity in the crypto space? We echo SLNH's statement : To our knowledge, Soluna is the only public company in the sector to have paid its investors dividends as we have done for the preferred stock ((SLNHP)). Some investors have inquired if they could take all or a portion of their monthly cash dividend in Soluna common stock. If we were to consider this it would be at the investor’s discretion as of the record date Although we shy away from investing in SLNH, we find SLNPH's risk level and yield respectable enough to get us invested. Based on the thesis laid out in this article, we've converted part of our Bitcoin holdings into SLNHP. The dividend payouts will be used to buy long-dated call options ( read here to find out why - hint: 13.6x expected return with limited downside should Bitcoin hit $115,000 in 3 years).",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4551227-slnhp-defi-level-yield-bitcoin-level-risk?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3580665.jpeg

42415124,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXR2o,1667251273,Market Wrap: Dogecoin’s October Finale Trumps All Other Major Cryptos,"Price Action  Dogecoin (DOGE) was recently up 8% to continue its late October surge. The popular meme coin, which was created to mock the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, spiked late last week as billionaire entrepreneur and DOGE advocate Elon Musk neared the completion of his $44 billion purchase of Twitter. Over the past four days Musk has asserted his control over the social media platform. On Monday, he ousted Twitter’s nine-person board.  As CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams wrote, DOGE’s price fluctuations seem to stem from the power of Musk’s personality and a passionate dogecoin community than the macroeconomic indicators that have been influencing bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos for months. DOGE’s rise may correlate with excessive liquidations and a likely short squeeze, and the token may offer a shorting opportunity, Williams wrote.  Bitcoin (BTC) spent Monday in the red and was recently down about 1.3% over the past 24 hours, although the largest cryptocurrency by market value remained comfortably over the $20,000 perch it assumed last week. Ether was up similarly over the same period and was changing hands above the $1,500 level that the second-largest crypto assumed a week ago.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently rose 0.5% over the past 24 hours.  In traditional markets, the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Standard & Poor’s 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all closed lower, although the indexes enjoyed a strong month amid faint hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve will ratchet back its hawkish monetary policy early next year. Investors will be eyeing the latest Federal Open Market Committee interest rate hike, which is widely expected to be a robust 75 basis points.

Technical Take  Dogecoin’s 102% Spike Steals the Spotlight as October Ends  By Glenn Williams Jr  Crypto markets fell on the final day of October, with bitcoin (BTC) declining 1.2% and ether (ETH) falling 1.8%. The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ended the month up 5% and 17%, respectively.  Dogecoin (DOGE), the Shibu-Inu themed meme coin, led all gainers for October, rising 102%, about 90% of which occurred during the last week. DOGE remains a top 10 cryptocurrency by market capitalization at approximately $15.6 billion.  Unlike BTC and ETH, whose fortunes appear tied to macroeconomic factors, burn rates and centralized exchange balances, dogecoin’s appeal appears to stem from community, personality (Elon Musk) and the opportunity for outsized gains within a rapid period of time.

Rubin, who pioneered online crowdfunding when he co-founded Indiegogo in 2008, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” he felt compelled to join the Switzerland-based startup because of the “generational leaps” the company is making in terms of the technology it is using to securely store and process data “in an absolute private way.”  “It’s on the cutting edge of where things are headed,” Rubin said.  The decentralized public network operates on a cryptographic primitive model known as Nil Message Compute (NMC). Its nodes have the ability to work together using non-blockchain technology, which is known as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC).

The Greatest Rug Pull Of All Time In 2020 and much of 2021, crypto was easy money. Actually, it was two kinds of easy money. It was easy money if you traded it, and it was easy money if you were paid to promote it as something that everyone including your grandparents should trade. And, like all easy money schemes, it came to an ignominious end. From this: Crypto Bros Buy Real Estate (NY Post) To this: Crypto Bankruptcies (The Tokenist) The Wild West days of jumping aboard whichever coin was trending that week are likely done with as a reliable way of making money (don't laugh - for many it was a reliable way of making money for a time). All Risk Assets Have Sold Off In 2022 From the 2021 peak, even the two leading crypto names have experienced a deep selloff. Think your S&P-heavy 401k is hurting? Your high-beta tech portfolio causing you pain and worry? Imagine if you had bought the crypto dream and held in anticipation of the Moon, the Lambo, or whatnot. Here's the S&P 500, the Nasdaq-100, the BTC-USD cross, the ETH-USD cross, and the ARK Innovation ETF ( ARKK ) over the last 12 months, shown as the percent drop from the high of that period. % Off Highs Chart (YCharts.com) S&P painful, Nasdaq more so; crypto and ARKK all clustered together with a 2/3 drop in value. Ouch. This has led, of course, to a certain fear level in crypto. Crypto Fear vs. Greed Index (Alternative.me) Now, a theme of our work is that in securities markets it's always Opposite Day . So if something is all beaten up and FinTwit has decided it is dead and buried forever, our interest is piqued. We Anticipate Growing Strength In Certain Crypto Assets Crypto, we believe, is going through a bifurcation and transformation. We believe that the two leading systems - Bitcoin and Ether - will pull away from the altcoin pack. We believe that the two systems will become professionalized and institutionalized. That they will become more like securities both in practice and, quite likely, in principle and, over time, in law. We expect all this to be to the chagrin of both the ""let the code be free"" mathmo types and the ""Wen Lambo"" crypto bro crowd. But it will be to the benefit of institutional investors and those who choose to invest in the manner of those institutions. In our single-stock analysis, we utilize the notion of the ""Wyckoff Cycle"" which as you know is an idealized form of how large account players are able to create and realize gains solely from buying and selling activity itself, not from any underlying intrinsic value. We've written about this extensively elsewhere, including here . We think that Wyckoff-type institutional accumulation already has begun in both Bitcoin and Ether. We track both daily vs the main stock indices - initially we did so as a kind of canary-in-the-coalmine early indicator of risk appetite. Few instruments are as high-beta as crypto; Bitcoin and Ether are the most liquid crypto instruments; so, we thought, we can use them as advance warning of what may come each day or week in the S&P or the Nasdaq. And this isn't a bad tool as it turns out. Not perfect, of course, but not bad. Where this got really interesting though was after the June lows were struck in the equity indices. As you know, there was a violent rally to the August highs and an equally violent drop to the October lows which were below the June lows in the S&P, in the Nasdaq and the Dow, and a double-test of the same lows in the case of the Russell. And crypto being high beta - meaning it overreacts to changes vs. the S&P say - you would expect a similar pattern plus some amplification. Right? Wrong. Look. Here's the S&P - the Nasdaq and the Dow follow suit, by the way. SPY June vs October 2022 lows (TrendSpider, Cestrian Analysis) Now, look at BTC. BTC June Lows (TradingView, Cestrian Analysis) And at ETH. ETH June Lows (TradingView, Cestrian Analysis) So on the face of it this already looks interesting. Why would two very-scary-indeed assets hold up over the June lows when the major stock market indices did not? Well, there are two reasons, in our view, not mutually exclusive. First, derivatives. The indices and their ETFs are subject to substantial pressures from the huge wall of capital sloshing around in the options market. Indeed, if you take a look at major reversals of the S&P through an options market lens, you can see the power of options flows - the reversals tend to happen upon large-volume options expiry dates, after which market makers rebalance their hedges to get back to a delta-neutral position. Again, here's the S&P. (Underlying analysis includes work by SpotGamma.) S&P - Options Expiry Impact (SpotGamma, Cestrian Analysis, TrendSpider) Crypto doesn't have anything like this level of pressure from the derivatives market. So we don't think the strength of crypto can be explained away through options expiries - you can however make a good case that the weakness of equity indices in September and October is due to the impact of a wall of puts being bought by investors. No, our second reason is that we believe that Bitcoin and Ether are now being quietly accumulated by institutional investors. We think that the price and volume activity supports this thesis. Let's look at Ether first, because the evidence there is more compelling than Bitcoin, in our view. ETHUSD - Volume By Price Analysis (TradingView, Cestrian Analysis) The blue/yellow bars on the right-hand side of the chart show volume traded at each price level. The chart starts in July 2021 and the volume by price indicators do likewise. The largest volumes of purchases have been made in the range of roughly $1050-$1725. Zooming out, you can see that this price zone corresponds broadly to typical 'Wave 2' (shock and awe selloff!) retracement levels. ETHUSD Fibonacci Retracement Analysis (TradingView, Cestrian Analysis) And that in our view is no coincidence. The reason you see support for shock & awe selloffs around this level and speed of deep retracement - a Wave 2 in Elliott Wave parlance - is that this level of dumping drives the despair that you see in retail crypto right now (or retail e-commerce, etc., for that matter). Institutions, not being prone to despair, have long known to buy the fear, embrace the abandonment. And this we believe is taking place in Ether right now. If you zoom back in you can start to see a larger-degree Wave 3 (which could reach at least a new high above $4880 if we have the pattern correct) take shape with an i, ii, and iii up off of those June lows. Like this: ETHUSD Smaller Degree Wave Pattern (TradingView, Cestrian Analysis) We're bullish on Ether in consequence. Should ETH-USD reach up and over $2,035 anytime soon that would be further confirmation of our bull thesis. Turning now to Bitcoin which has a less compelling chart in our opinion, but still has the signs of accumulation in its volume by price action which again has hit heavy volumes at the same Wave 2 retracement zone down from the Wave 1 struck from the 2020 lows to the 2021 highs. BTCUSD Volume x Price at the 786 Retrace (TradingView, Cestrian Analysis) Why less compelling than Ether? Because we don't yet see the characteristic 1 up, 2 down, 3 up pattern of a new bull phase taking shape. But you can see the accumulation for yourself. We're bullish on Bitcoin - just not as bullish as for Ether.

The partnership was initially announced in February and the GameStop NFT platform has been operating as a public beta since July. The official launch will allow marketplace users to access Web3 games currently being built on ImmutableX, including Gods Unchained, Guild of Guardians and Illuvium, as well as additional NFT gaming assets. The layer 2 scaling product can facilitate “100% gas-free and carbon-neutral minting and trading” on the GameStop NFT marketplace, according to its developers, making it an attractive solution for players new to Web3 gaming.  The two platforms have worked together on several initiatives since February, including launching a $100 million grant for builders and creators of Web3 gaming and integrating ImmutableX into the GameStop NFT Marketplace’s wallet to allow for easier management of digital assets.  GameStop has been working to build out its suite of Web3 integrations over the past year. In May, the retailer released its self-custodial crypto and NFT wallet. In July, it linked up with layer 2 scaling product Loopring to process transactions for its beta marketplace launch, bringing in $7.2 million in its opening week of sales. Most recently, the retailer announced an upcoming partnership with cryptocurrency exchange FTX.  Jonathan Reedy, vice president of strategic partnerships at ImmutableX, told CoinDesk that both firms aim to onboard new Web3 gamers by offering educational materials and introducing in-person and virtual gameplay down the line.  “ImmutableX hopes to create a gaming landscape that no longer thinks about blockchain gaming in terms of wallets, bridges, chains and rollups but instead, true digital ownership and fun sit at the heart of the gameplay experience,” said Reedy.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | LRC | REGULATION | IMX,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/10/31/gamestop-nft-marketplace-goes-live-on-immutablex,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c5823b1c33fe3a585f8b198bf7ff06536bfe5ae-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420877,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZEb,1667245343,Dogecoin’s 102% Spike Steals the Spotlight as October Ends,"Technical Take  Crypto markets fell on the final day of October, with bitcoin (BTC) declining 1.2% and ether (ETH) falling 1.8%. The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ended the month up 5% and 17%, respectively.  Dogecoin (DOGE), the Shibu-Inu themed meme coin, led all gainers for October, rising 102%, about 90% of which occurred during the last week. DOGE remains a top 10 cryptocurrency by market capitalization at approximately $15.6 billion.  Unlike BTC and ETH, whose fortunes appear tied to macroeconomic factors, burn rates and centralized exchange balances, dogecoin’s appeal appears to stem from community, personality (Elon Musk) and the opportunity for outsized gains within a rapid period of time.  This week, crypto investors will be weighing a range of economic indicators. In the U.S. the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces its latest interest rate decision, a widely expected 75 basis point increase. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its latest jobs data while the Institute for Supply Management issues its October manufacturing report.  Yet, dogecoin will likely remain more affected by the utterances and actions of newly minted Twitter owner, billionaire and DOGE advocate Elon Musk.  DOGE supporters may view their investments as a sub-$1 vote of confidence in Musk’s business acumen, which has significant upside and limited downside.  The correlation coefficients for DOGE compared with bitcoin and ether are 0.78 and 0.85, respectively. Correlation coefficients range from 1 to -1, with the former indicating a direct pricing relationship and the latter signaling a completely inverse relationship.  So despite seemingly being driven by different factors, DOGE maintains a surprisingly strong correlation to both BTC and ETH.  Unusual weekend activity in DOGE appears to depart from its more traditional counterparts, despite their correlations.  While Saturday trading volume for BTC and ETH fell within normal ranges, DOGE volume was eight times more than its 20-day moving average on the day. Sharp price increases in conjunction with high volume are often a bullish sign for an asset.  DOGE’s increase came in conjunction with excessive liquidations, and a likely short squeeze, which may also give investors pause. The recent run-up may also make DOGE an attractive short candidate for traders who do not believe in the price move. For those of that mindset, a potential price target may be at 7 cents where significant past trading activity has occurred.  DOGE is also trading 60% higher than its 20-day moving average, and has pushed significantly past the upper range of its Bollinger Bands, which sat at the approximately 7 cents mark prior to the Twitter acquisition.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for DOGE is showing as significantly overbought now at 88.60, its highest reading since April 2021.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/31/dogecoins-102-spike-steals-the-spotlight-as-october-ends,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b9fb8123ac0fd20f9570d09d147e8e74f9b9a89-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The e-CNY is being rolled out on a trial basis across the country in 23 cities.

He explained that is accomplished via the fact that ""transaction-related data is encrypted for storage,"" ""entities and individuals are prohibited from arbitrary inquiry or information usage without rigorous legal authorization"" and that China's central bank keeps ""small-amount soft wallets and hard wallets to meet the need for small-value anonymous transactions, both online and offline.""

Bitcoin&apos;s Recent Upwards Momentum Has Brought It Near Realized Price Again As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC has spent a total of 138 days under the realized price so far since the June of this year. Before we look at the data for the Bitcoin realized price, it&apos;s best if a basic understanding of the &apos;realized cap&apos; is attained first. The realized cap is calculated by multiplying each coin in the circulating supply with the price at which the particular coin was last moved or sold at, and then taking the sum for the entire supply. This is different from the usual market cap, which doesn&apos;t weigh each coin separately like this, and simply multiplies the entire supply with the current BTC price.

42393768,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAn9D,1667240914,Can Crypto Buy a Seat in Congress?,"A mountain of crypto riches can’t automatically purchase a seat in Congress. But for many campaigns winding their way toward the U.S. midterm election next week, it certainly doesn’t hurt.  This year’s elections mark the first wave of races in which industry donations not only rose to significant levels but, with well over $80 million in play, it actually reached a level occupied by other U.S. industries famous for their political clout – such as health care, energy and Wall Street itself.  Still, crypto’s campaign largesse didn’t assure victories during the primaries, as demonstrated by the flameout of Oregon congressional candidate Carrick Flynn after a single industry source spent nearly $1,000 for every vote he landed. Or consider the New York contest in which one of the industry’s chief Washington advocates, Michelle Bond, couldn’t muster one-third of the vote despite courting endorsements from Donald Trump Jr. and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).  Campaigns for the general election are in their final days as they press toward the Nov. 8 vote. While crypto interests may have wasted money in some noteworthy cases, they also managed to add serious dollars to close primary races that went their way.  One of the strategies of the industry’s most widely funded political action committee, according to an analysis of federal campaign records, was to support candidates in districts or states in which party dominance would already settle the general election. The political hopefuls supported by GMI PAC were often younger candidates seeking seats vacated by older lawmakers who retired or sought other offices.  Overall, a lot of the industry money – when factoring in the conservative PACs with GMI’s more balanced approach – went to crypto-sympathetic Republicans. Friends in the GOP could serve the industry well because Republicans are expected to take over the House majority.  “The balance of probabilities heavily favors the Republicans netting the five seats necessary to take control of the House,” said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at BTIG, a financial-services firm. They also have a chance to seize the Senate, though that remains a tougher path.  Deepest pockets  Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto exchange FTX, and fellow FTX executive Ryan Salame have drawn the most attention this year as campaign ATMs, with Bankman-Fried surging to become the country’s fourth-largest individual donor, according to campaign-finance analytical site OpenSecrets.org. That means he’s sandwiched between giants of U.S. investing – Ken Griffin of Citadel at No. 3 and Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International Group at No. 5. Yass is also a major donor for the crypto cause.  Much of the crypto industry’s giving is funneled through a small number of PACs that amassed major war chests. They typically spend the money on “independent expenditures” – the way a committee can spend unlimited amounts on ads to support a candidate without directly contributing money. Total ad spending is projected to approach $10 billion for the midterms, according to tracking firm AdImpact.  Two of the biggest PACs – Bankman-Fried’s Protect our Future and Salame’s American Dream Federal Action – are propped up almost entirely by the FTX executives. Bankman-Fried’s is easily the largest, having given $28 million. However, despite the CEO’s lofty position in the digital-assets industry, he says that’s not what his election involvement is about, leaving the political world confused about whether his candidates even have any private thoughts about crypto.  At a recent event in Washington, he said he wants “a culture of bipartisan constructive compromise and progress as opposed to partisan bickering.” But more specifically, he favors candidates who will prevent devastation from future pandemics. He said he’s supporting “people who will make sure to follow through on common sense things to try to not have what happened to us over the last few years happen again, except maybe way more deadly.”  With Bankman-Fried on that unrelated crusade, it may be FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Salame (No. 11 among the nation’s individual donors) who wins the title of the industry’s most prolific campaign contributor trying to shape digital-assets policy with his money. Salame’s PAC has been backing Republican candidates such as Alabama's Katie Britt, who is expected to win a Senate seat next month and arrive in Washington, D.C., supportive of crypto causes.  With the crypto PAC supplying her almost $2 million in ad support, Alabama Republicans voted for Britt to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Richard Shelby, for whom she had served as chief of staff. Though Senate races such as hers are high-dollar affairs, the $2 million the PAC spent – according to available Federal Election Commission filings up to Sept. 30 – was equal to about a fifth of her overall direct campaign contributions from donors.  Britt, who is expected to coast through the general election in that GOP stronghold, has promised “staunch support” on Capitol Hill for the crypto industry.  “Supporting bitcoin means supporting personal freedom, American competitiveness and national security,” Britt said on her campaign website.  The PAC also boosted Brad Finstad (R-Minn.), a former Trump administration official who is the favorite to beat his Democratic opponent in Minnesota for a House seat. Finstad, who already won a special election this year to finish an incomplete term, hasn’t made crypto a plank in his campaign platform, but Salame’s group spent nearly $2 million on him earlier this year.  PAC millions  Apart from the FTX executives’ groups, the crypto industry has several others PACs. Two of the biggest are the Crypto Freedom PAC, a group backed by Yass and the conservative Club for Growth that’s deployed about $5 million so far this year, and GMI – which took in $12 million in this cycle and funds other industry PACs, including Web3 Forward and Crypto Innovation.  GMI is bankrolled by prominent industry names, including the founders of venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Circle Internet Financial, the FTX executives and many others, and its two affiliated PACs each focus on one of the political parties.  In one of the 15 primary wins GMI helped secure for candidates this year, it backed Jonathan Jackson, an Illinois businessman and college professor who is the son of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jackson, a rare congressional candidate who not only mentions crypto but has included it among the top issues of his campaign, was supported by almost $500,000 in ad buys. That amount rivals the money his campaign received in direct contributions.  “While 15 seats is a great start, it takes more than a single election cycle to truly effect change in Washington,” said Michael Carcaise, a strategist for GMI. He added that “seats up and down the ballot – including the race for president – are very much on our radar, not just in 2024 but for at least the next decade.”  The conservative Crypto Freedom PAC also threw support to Blake Masters, a Republican Senate candidate in Arizona and one of the most prominent crypto candidates in the midterms. Masters, the chief operating officer at billionaire and PayPal (PYPL) co-founder Peter Thiel’s venture-capital firm, has spoken about the need for crypto’s innovations to go up against what he describes as a corrupt banking system.  Polling has been showing that Arizona seat to be among the tightest election battles on the map. It’s one of the handful of races that will decide the majority of the Senate and potentially whether the Republicans control Congress entirely next year.  To be sure, some industry donations have also gone to veteran lawmakers who are likely to have an outsized role in crypto policy. Those include Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the potential next chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and who has been negotiating a possible stablecoin oversight bill, and Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), one of the authors of major crypto legislation in the Senate Agriculture Committee.  Though the industry has barely gotten its feet wet in politics, it already learned some major cautionary lessons about investing in novice candidates. In Oregon, Flynn didn’t have any apparent crypto position, but his major backer was one of the industry’s biggest names. Bankman-Fried’s PAC provided more than $10 million to fill every household in the district with his name.  The candidate who beat Flynn – an established legislator who served in the Democratic leadership of the Oregon House of Representatives – won twice as many votes from people in the district who were reportedly bewildered by the sudden ubiquity of the remarkably well-funded stranger.  The race for that district – in an interesting side note – also included Matt West, a decentralized finance (DeFi) developer who largely bankrolled his own campaign, but he came in sixth out of nine Democratic candidates. It was Bankman-Fried’s COVID-19 pandemic interests that assured his opponent, Flynn, got the support instead of the digital-assets veteran in that race.  “We thought it was worth increasing the chances of someone with genuine pandemic prevention expertise being elected to Congress,” said Mike Levine, a spokesman for the Protect Our Future PAC.  To a lesser extent, Salame’s American Dream Federal Action PAC also lost a major bet on a Republican candidate when Rep. Davis Rodney (R-Ill.) was badly beaten in the primaries by a candidate favored by former President Donald Trump. The PAC devoted more than $2 million trying to get Rodney re-elected.  Political giving has “been a little bit of a mixed bag” in these early days, said Kristin Smith, who runs the Blockchain Association in Washington, which has recently started its own PAC. But she noted the “huge shift” from just a few years ago, when crypto insiders were still resistant to engaging with politicians. She said that changed when the industry was blindsided by crypto tax provisions in a bill last year.  Winning and losing may not be the main point to the industry’s new involvement in U.S. political campaigns. Just tallying up the congressional election victories “misses the forest for the trees,” said Boltansky. The more important point is that the crypto field is making itself known as a significant political force.  “The industry will have the relationships and standing necessary to engage with policymakers the next time we see either a bad bill or a harmful proposal,” Boltansky said. That’s meaningful going into this next congressional session, when “there could be some actual movement on targeted measures like the stablecoin bill.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/31/can-crypto-buy-a-seat-in-congress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d7bf47e737a682901c8270f6349666cb8853dba-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394164,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXtUL,1667236935,The Myth of ‘Regulatory Clarity’,"Go around the room at any highbrow crypto gathering and ask what the suited participants are most excited about. The answer you’ll most likely hear is “regulatory clarity.” They’re not wrong – it would indeed be a boon to the industry as it would give builders and investors a certain amount of protection and usher in even more institutional funds.  But it’s not the “make or break” for crypto that it’s sometimes painted to be. And those who insist that “all of crypto must be regulated” display a lack of understanding of what crypto is and how it got to where it is today.  Not all crypto markets will end up regulated. But nor do they need to be for the industry to succeed. I’ll go even further – nor should they be.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  As a crypto analyst with an institutional bias, I am inherently pro-regulation. Despite my slightly libertarian leanings, I support the role of government in protecting citizens. And I recognize that many investors are more comfortable with some degree of protection when it comes to financial transactions.  Last week, Bloomberg published the results of a recent MLIV survey, in which 60% of 564 respondents agree that more regulation would make them more likely to invest in crypto assets. Also last week, CoinDesk reported on a poll conducted by the Crypto Council for Innovation, an alliance of major crypto companies, that showed 52% of the 1,200 participants (of whom only 13% own cryptocurrency) want the industry to be more regulated. On Thursday, Fidelity Digital Assets published its annual survey of global institutional investors, which cited regulatory issues as one of the top barriers to investment.  So, the numbers suggest that investors are awaiting more regulation with open arms. This is supported by the hopeful narrative that more regulation will bring in more institutional funds, which will boost prices.  But let’s look a bit closer before we take a big step back.  The numbers published in this week’s three surveys are not conclusive: 40% of Bloomberg’s respondents said the degree of regulation would have little impact in their crypto investment decision. For the Crypto Council for Innovation poll, almost half either don’t want the industry to be more regulated or they are indifferent to it. The Fidelity Digital Assets survey shows that concern about the classification of certain assets came in seventh in the list of investment barriers, while a “lack of regulatory clarity” came toward the bottom. Only 4% of Asian institutions and less than 20% of European respondents cited this as something they worried about.  So regulatory issues are a concern for many, but not for all. And here we come to the bigger issue: the idea that all crypto markets can be or even need to be regulated.  This stems from the institutional mindset. Most institutions can only transact on regulated exchanges, and all institutions want to avoid future legal issues. What’s more, most crypto market firms want institutional clients, for the transaction volumes and willingness to pay for services. So crypto regulation is verging on an obsession among service providers and a meaningful chunk of investors.  But it’s not an obsession for the whole industry, and to assume this is the natural state of affairs is to overlook a key feature of both crypto and regulation: They are about choice.  Crypto emerged as an alternative to the centralized fiat system, and the explosion of innovation, technological progress and incentive experimentation over the past few years has generated a dizzying array of assets, use cases, governance styles, trading platforms, tribes, even aesthetics.  The role of choice in regulation is not so obvious. We’re taught that we have to obey the rules, but this isn’t true. We can ignore them (please note that I am NOT recommending this!), but there is a price. Sometimes the cost is high (e.g., men with guns will lock you up for a very long time), sometimes not so much (your bank will make sure you pay the assigned penalty). We evaluate the trade-off – and for most, there are moral and social costs as well – and we act accordingly. But the choice is ultimately ours.  In exchange for obeying the rules, we get protection. This is usually a very good thing. But when it comes to financial transactions, for some that protection can feel like centralized control, especially when opportunities are denied based on seemingly arbitrary filters, and individual financial agency is curtailed because of some distant and imaginary threat. For many participants, however, that protection implies fair pricing, recourse if anything goes wrong and the civic comfort that illicit transfers are more easily flagged.  This brings us to the contradiction inherent in the institutionalization of crypto. On the one hand, that process is forging a stronger industry. But it’s also causing a myopic focus and a blurred narrative. Crypto markets originally developed at the grassroots level, with no regulatory oversight or protection whatsoever. As the investor base broadened and as certain blow-ups highlighted the often-painful lack of rules, the demand for more reliable platforms led to the birth of the market infrastructure we have today. This in turn fueled the growth of investor interest, including among more restricted participants with deep pockets, and the boost in volumes supported both prices and further innovation.  Institutional investor involvement in crypto markets is good. It is a sign of success. But the outsized weight of its influence has led to the conflation of “crypto potential” with “institutional needs.” This makes it easy for us to forget that crypto emerged retail-first, with hundreds of thousands of individuals leading the way. That, in turn, tends to hone focus on fitting a square peg into a round hole because regulators insist that current rules can cover our industry. This is a generalization, sure, but one that is delaying support for certain areas of progress as infrastructure participants wait for a regulatory clarity that is unlikely to ever get ahead of or even keep up with crypto innovation and demand.  Crypto applications will continue to emerge on the fringes, and there is not much anyone can do to stop this. Remember: Token issuance and trading is not controlled by any central authority.  And not all of crypto needs “regulatory clarity” or institutional participation. Much of it simply needs testing with real users and real incentives with some degree of supervision to ensure fair markets and mitigate illicit use. More regulatory sandboxes, for example, could further industry experience while deepening official understanding of the risks and opportunities. And there are no doubt other frameworks that could give officials some assurance that crime is not abetted and that participants understand the choices they are making. Fewer rules means more opportunity but less protection. Waiting for a detailed framework or even specific limitations could imply greater safety but more delay.  In sum, regulators could give crypto industry builders and market participants more choice in the rules they follow while showing support for good faith human ingenuity and respect for those it helps. And, in so doing, they could perhaps strengthen the appreciation for what regulation has to offer.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/31/the-myth-of-regulatory-clarity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69db166977b472644a2665af64d91d4d068a105f-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394133,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXsuR,1667235801,End of the Monopoly: How Bitcoin Will Usher in a New Era of Governance in Crypto,"Across the world, people are losing trust in the institutions that underpin society. Any thinking person can see the institutions of governance, finance and money are corrupt, incompetent and yet unavoidable.  As a result, the world is in a continued state of crisis, gyrating from one emergency to another with ever increasing speed and volatility. Progress and growth are stagnant. Hate, nihilism and pessimism are culturally dominant.  Edan Yago is the founder of Sorvyn. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The failings of our institutions are many but the root cause is the same: monopoly power.  We all know that monopolies are bad for everyone except the company concentrating power. Yet, when it comes to the greatest monopoly of all, the state, we somehow forget commonsense. Why? Because we assume there is no alternative. Of course a singular entity must oversee the law, and control violence within its borders.  Until very recently this assumption was warranted, but on Jan. 3, 2009, Satoshi released Bitcoin and showed us an alternative. He showed it is possible to build a system of rules without an administrator. He showed that this can be applied to the most fundamental institution of property and law: the institution of money.  Bitcoin showed that all users can be superusers and that admins are not necessary at all.  See also: Why Satoshi Chose Halloween to Release the Bitcoin White Paper | Opinion  What Bitcoin demonstrated in the domain of money, tokens have since demonstrated for other types of digital property. More recently, decentralized finance (DeFi) is calling into question the need for admins in financial services. Web3 (or 5, if you prefer) is likewise an effort to eliminate the need for internet services to be monopolies as well.  We are part of the most historically radical revolution in human affairs and few seem to grasp the full magnitude of what is happening. The endpoint of this revolution is that we will finally rid ourselves of the most dangerous and destructive monopoly of them all – the monopoly that backstops all other monopolies – the monopoly of the state.  Wrong turns  Since most people do not comprehend the final destination, we are taking many wrong turns along the way. “I’m in it for the tech” or “blockchain not Bitcoin” say those who see just another Silicon Valley-style tech disruption. They are distracted and obsessed with features instead of principles, inviting the admins back into power, to eke out faster transactions or greater throughput.  One of the most brilliant aspects of Bitcoin’s design was that it is a tool for liberty, dressed up as a get-rich-quick scheme. Much of “crypto” has perversely turned this on its head, pumping out get-rich-quick schemes dressed up as tools for economic freedom.  Apart from crypto, “bitcoiners” also frequently fail to properly identify the historic moment. From a reliance on centralized services, to the commonly held hope for institutional adoption, most traders and many HODLers are more interested in ""number go up"" than on ""authorities brought down.""  For all the conviction of token Bitcoin maximalism, it too misses the point. Its central tenet is that no other tokens, besides BTC, should exist. This is monopolist thinking applied to Bitcoin. The result is a myopic focus on money as the root of all evil. A belief that we can fix all problems, if we simply fix the money.  Money, if it is the root of all evil, is antithetical to Bitcoin. There's been thousands of years of anti-market thinking, stretching back at least as far as Jesus smashed the merchants and money-changers. The corruption of money is a serious problem, but even the most casual reflection on human history makes clear that it is not the only problem, or even the most serious.  Some of the most cruel and totalitarian regimes existed on a gold standard. Sound money didn’t prevent the slave trade, the proscriptions of Augusts or the innumerable massacres that occurred in between. Human history is the story of gang violence and mob bosses. Fixing money is a heroic start to fixing the corruption of monopoly power, but shouldn’t be confused for a universal miracle cure.  Satoshi’s legions  In a boastful moment, the Roman General Pompeius Magnus, declared “I have only to stamp my foot, and legions will spring up all over Italy”. This is how humanity's mob bosses have for centuries run the world, through their ability to call forth physical power, loyal to them.  Then along came Satoshi, the boss of no one, who clicked his mouse and legions of miners sprang up all over the world, loyal to encode rules and function, not men. Satoshi showed us that a decentralized consensus mechanism can call forth and coordinate power in the real world.  Take this to its logical conclusion and it becomes clear that we can, and will, replace mob bosses and central admins with leaderless consensus rules. We might not rid ourselves completely of violence, power and policing but we no longer need a state monopoly in charge to prevent a slide into chaos.  We, the legions loyal to Satoshi’s ideas, will construct new institutions of governance that are based on voluntary participation and free market incentives. These institutions, blockchains, decentralized autonomous organization (DAOs) and P2P networks, will be the opposite of monopolies; they will compete for users and members.  We will be masters of code, rather than the other way round. We will construct a world where, just like BTC, all property will be cryptographically proven, enforced and immutable. To do so, we will build systems that incentivize and coordinate decentralized “police.”  The world will replace the state with Nakamoto consensus, not because it is the right thing to do but because it is the lucrative thing to do. Half the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) is controlled by governments. Once we realize we can do to government what we are doing to money, the game theory will play out on its own. The next Bitcoin-sized asymmetric bet, after sound money and sound finance, is sound governance. Get in early.  Like Prometheus, Satoshi gave fire and left. Its flame lights the way to the next phase of human civilization. We will cast aside the central powers that monopolize sovereignty. With them gone, none will be our masters but ourselves.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Edan Yago,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/31/bitcoin-crypto-governance-monopoly,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08c59ce6837bf865e59956ca52c98b9e336b6eb0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394129,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXskB,1667233265,More than Just the Ooki DAO: Lessons for Web3 Companies About Control After bZx,"In September, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) brought two actions against bZeroX, its two co-founders and the Ooki decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and underlying regulations.  While the commission’s move against the Ooki DAO is no doubt a significant milestone, there are other important aspects of these enforcement actions that also merit close attention, including for what they teach us about how regulators view control of Web3 protocols to work around technical hurdles and hold operators accountable.  David J. Kappos is a partner in Cravath, Swaine & Moore’s corporate department and co-chair of the firm’s intellectual property practice. Evan Mehran Norris is a partner in Cravath, Swaine & Moore’s litigation department and a member of the firm’s investigations and regulatory enforcement practice. Daniel M. Barabander is an associate in Cravath, Swaine & Moore’s corporate department.  Over the past several years, we have repeatedly heard from industry participants that enforcement against Web3 platforms is unlikely, or even impossible, because existing regulations have architectural incompatibilities with Web3 platform functionality, making the concept of compliance inapt. That view should finally be put to rest. As the U.S. Treasury Department (Tornado Cash) and now the CFTC have demonstrated, regulators can and will make aggressive arguments to maneuver around potential barriers to enforcement presented by Web3 technology.  The area where we repeatedly see regulators blur the line between technical reality and their regulatory objectives is around control of a decentralized protocol. The bZx protocol, like all Ethereum-based protocols, is built using smart contracts, the defining feature of which is that they do not require a centralized operator to run their code; they run autonomously. This is a challenge blockchain technology presents to regulators across the board – how to hold persons accountable for code that does not require identifiable persons to run?  The bZx enforcement action demonstrates how at least one key regulator is thinking about control of Web3 protocols in order to hold operators accountable: by examining both technical and business control to draw the line between identifiable persons and autonomously run protocols.  Technical control  Technical control refers to technical mechanisms protocol developers use to control their protocol on the smart contract level, often by defining “admin-only” functions that can be called solely by specific parties. Technical control is at the heart of the CFTC’s analysis. In fact, it is the determiner of the two time periods the CFTC lays out – the “bZx Relevant Period” and the “DAO Relevant Period.”  Within those two time periods, the CFTC focuses on four levers of control – admin-only functionalities retained by bZeroX and the co-founders, and subsequently, the DAO: (1) upgrading protocol smart contracts; (2) pausing or suspending trading; (3) pausing or suspending contributions or withdrawals of assets and redemptions; and (4) directing disposition of the funds held on protocol smart contracts.  The CFTC’s primary vehicle for pointing out instances in which these parties did in fact exert such control relate to two exploits. First, it cites a $55 million hack the protocol suffered in November 2021 after a “spearfishing attack against a bZx DAO developer.”  In response to the breach, the DAO exerted its control over treasury funds, by “vot[ing] to utilize funds from the bZx DAO Treasury to compensate certain bZx DAO members and other users of the bZx Protocol who lost funds in connection with” the incident.  Second, the commission cites a February 2020 margin-lending exploit that targeted bZx and led to a loss of 1,300 wrapped ETH. To stop the hemorrhaging, “bZeroX utilized its Keys to pause trading and withdrawals, and to implement fixes to the smart contract code, to address the existing or potential losses to the bZx Protocol” caused by the incident.  As these two incidents show, technical control is at the heart of Web3 exploits because it (a) presents centralized points of failure and thus an attractive attack vector in decentralized systems and (b) exists to allow a protocol to swiftly respond to emergencies. The responses to these attacks make an easy case for regulators to demonstrate technical control and, thus, identifiable operators of the protocol.  Business control  The CFTC also repeatedly points to softer “business controls” to show that the respondents had control of the bZx protocol and, thus, should be liable.  The commission focuses most clearly on the fact that the respondents “designed, deployed, marketed and made solicitations” concerning the bZx protocol.  First, it is clear that the CFTC views operating a front-end website to interact with the bZx protocol as a form of business control. The CFTC cites the front end as a vehicle “to market, solicit orders for and facilitate access to the bZx Protocol” because it “enabled users, through the click of a few buttons, to transfer assets and open positions on the bZx Protocol.”  Second, and as discussed above, the CFTC cites the respondents’ public statements and marketing as examples of business control. For example, the commission points out that the co-founders “made public statements, appeared in interviews, wrote articles, led calls with community members that are publicly available on YouTube and otherwise publicly marketed and solicited members of the public to utilize the bZx Protocol” pre- and post-shifting technical control to the DAO, all as a form of business control.  Third, active participation in a DAO is seen as a form of business control. The CFTC finds in the settlement order that the co-founders were active on Ooki DAO governance matters. Further, one founder is cited for his “protocol development and marketing work … on the Ooki DAO’s behalf during the DAO Relevant Period,” while another is cited for his “business and budget planning and marketing work … on the Ooki DAO’s behalf during the DAO Relevant Period” for Ooki DAO after it obtained technical control.  The CFTC describes the co-founders’ active participation in the Ooki DAO to show why they are being held personally liable for the DAO’s actions. This is particularly interesting because the CFTC’s definition of DAO membership only requires casting a vote, so there should be no need to show the co-founders’ active involvement in the DAO to establish their membership in the DAO as the basis for holding them personally liable for the actions of the for-profit unincorporated association. The commission’s focus on such participation – despite it appearing superfluous in light of the CFTC’s definition of DAO membership – indicates that it views such participation as probative from a business control standpoint.  These enforcement actions reinforce the need for operators of Web3 protocols to have a better compliance policy than “technological infeasibility of compliance, so no compliance.” The CFTC’s in-depth analysis of technical and business control shows this clearly. Even though the bZx protocol runs autonomously, that will not stop regulators from seeking to identify operators in order to hold them accountable. While technology-first analysis is an important tool that can be used to support legal risk assessments, the bZx actions make clear that purely technical distinctions cannot justify a legal compliance strategy detached from practical realities.  As long as enforcement actions by federal regulatory agencies remain the dominant approach to policy development in the Web3 field, we must look to those actions to understand the evolving state of the regulatory landscape and what may come next. The CFTC’s moves against the bZx protocol demonstrates that regulators see points of control as strings to follow to the marionettist.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"David J.

The Department of Justice’s (DOJ) probe will now be led by U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter.  Bloomberg reported in July last year that federal prosecutors had been digging into whether Tether hid the nature of its crypto-related transactions from the banks it was working with during the fledgling days of its business.  Responding in a blog post published Monday, Tether said it is in open dialogue with law enforcement agencies, “helping the department … with some of the biggest cybercrime and national security cases in the country” and added that “Tether executives have had no interaction with the DOJ in connection with any investigation for well over a year and the DOJ does not appear to be actively investigating Tether.”  Still, the stablecoin issuer has long been plagued by accusations of murky banking relationships and opaque accounting practices.  In February 2021, Tether and its sister company, Bitfinex, paid $18.5 million to settle a nearly two-year-long investigation with the New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) office into whether it covered up the loss of nearly $1 billion in customer funds. In the settlement agreement, the NYAG said Tether used various banks but was suspended from some, including Wells Fargo, for unspecified reasons.  The SDNY has become something of a hot spot for crypto cases in recent years. Both the Celsius Network and Voyager Digital bankruptcy cases are being presided over by judges from the district’s bankruptcy court. The SDNY has also developed a reputation for working with other agencies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to bring crypto-centric criminal cases.  Former federal prosecutors speaking to Bloomberg speculated that the SDNY’s crypto expertise could be the reason for the unusual decision to move the investigation.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | USDT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/31/us-tether-bank-fraud-investigation-changes-hands-within-the-doj-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afdda7507858d851b39778694b956e5d7077ba11-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This stage of Project Orchid explored the potential use cases for a digital Singapore dollar as well as the infrastructure required to implement one. It looked at the concept of purpose-bound digital Singapore dollars, which allows senders to specify how and where the money will be used. They found there is currently no urgent need for a retail CBDC but said they want to be prepared in case that changes.  “MAS’ vision is to build an innovative and responsible digital asset ecosystem in Singapore,” the report said. The country has been collaborating with the crypto industry and issuing licenses to big players such as Coinbase and Blockchain.com, and has continued to explore a retail CBDC despite feeling like there is no need for one. Project Orchid was announced in November last year and even then-Managing Director Ravi Menon said that the benefits of a retail CBDC were “not compelling.”  Read more: Singapore Central Bank Proposes Stablecoin Rules to Rein In Crypto Sector  Countries around the world have been looking into retail CBDC’s. A BIS survey in May revealed that 90% of the 81 responding central banks have started work on a CBDC. The U.S., U.K. and European Union are reviewing whether or not they should issue a CBDC while China is further along than most countries in its CBDC trials.  “Although MAS does not see an urgent case for retail CBDC, it is envisioned that the study of potential use cases for a programmable digital SGD (Singapore dollar) and the infrastructure required, would enable MAS and the financial services ecosystem in Singapore to develop capabilities to support a retail CBDC should the need arise,” the report said.  MAS believes that a CBDC would be a small part of the money supply in the same way that physical cash is. Banknotes and coins issued by MAS only account for around 8% of the entire money supply, while privately issued money makes up 92%, the report said.  “Second, the retail CBDC system will form part of Singapore’s national foundational digital infrastructure, which brings together payments, digital identity and data exchange and authorization and consent mechanisms to protect the privacy and welfare of individuals more holistically,” the report said. It will be fully interoperable with other payment systems.  Some of the use cases of a CBDC will be tested through trials with the public and private sector in 2022 and 2023. The trials will include looking at government and commercial vouchers that can be used to purchase goods at the upcoming Singapore FinTech Festival. Government payouts will also be tested that do not require participants to have a bank account plus the CBDC will be used to automatically release grants.

Competition will be a substantially larger drag on October's production as total network hash rate has quickly jumped to and maintained 255 EH/s. Hut 8 has a strong balance sheet and expanded their business without taking on substantial debt or selling their mined Bitcoin. As a rough estimate, about a fourth of the August to September decline in Bitcoin equivalents likely came from the suspension of Ethereum mining. The company's high-performance computer business is operationally profitable and growing, but small in absolute dollar amounts, representing about 11% of revenues in Q2. It's really all about mining costs and production. Hut 8's ( HUT ) adjusted operating costs per coin, excluding depreciation, went from about $13,100 in the first quarter this year, to $18,900 in the second quarter. The company's Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) equivalent production for the first quarter was 942, with the second quarter coming in flat at 946. These two trends of lower margins and no growth look to continue or worsen in coming quarters as Hut 8 struggles with heightened energy prices and falling production levels resulting from its cautious view of mining economics. Offsetting these larger concerns, the company's high performance computer business is operationally profitable and growing. However, it is small in absolute dollar amounts, representing about 11% of revenues in Q2. Hut 8 has also maintained a strong balance sheet with low debt and a best in industry Bitcoin retention policy with substantial holdings. Even so, as discussed below, investors may be somewhat overvaluing these positives. Note, Canadian dollars were converted to US dollars at the rate of CAD 1.37 to USD 1. Hut 8's Low Growth: Ethereum End and Energy Prices Hut 8 produced 375 Bitcoin equivalents in August and 277 in September. The company's ASIC hash rate went from 2.98 EH/s to 3.07 EH/s, a 3% rise in the Bitcoin specific capacity. But Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) mining ended by midmonth with The Merge on the Ethereum platform coming September 15th, switching the blockchain's consensus mechanics away from mining. As a rough estimate, about a fourth of the month-over-month decline in Bitcoin equivalents likely came from the suspension of Ethereum mining. And recall that Hut 8 settled its Ethereum mining rewards in Bitcoins. Expect a larger absolute hit in October as the company was likely mining Ethereum in the first two weeks last month. Approximate Monthly Bitcoin Equivalent Production Q1'22 Q2'22 July '22 Aug. '22 Sept. '22 314 315 330 375 277 Author complied from hut8mining.com/media-room. Again, as a rough estimate, a single digit percentage of the September decline may be attributable to increased network competition. Though the total Bitcoin network hash rate started and ended the month just over 220 EH/s, there were spikes up to 230 EH/s during the month. However, competition will be a substantially larger drag on October's figures as total network hash rate has quickly jumped to and maintained 255 EH/s. Finally, though there was notable facility improvement downtime, it seems the largest portion of the month-over-month production decline came from energy pricing related scale backs. Unseasonably warm weather and global energy supply chain challenges caused power prices to fluctuate throughout September, and our operations team curtailed operations accordingly Operations Update for September 2022 , hut8mining.com, 10/4/22 ...we actively manage power at our sites in Alberta on a kind of a 15-minute increment cycle. Meaning we're always watching where power prices are, and when power prices get too high, we adjust operations accordingly. Jaime Leverton on Q2 2022 Results , seekingalpha.com, 8/11/22 It is hard to speculate on where Canadian natural gas prices are headed. But it is important to bear in mind some of Hut 8's equipment is unprofitable to operate near current Bitcoin prices and network difficulty during power price fluctuations. Note that Hut 8 is using a similar range of the latest generation MicroBT miner models at each location, but has different power pricing agreements across these sites. Looking forward, Hut 8 plans to raise installed hash rate capacity to 3.5 EH/s by yearend. This growth rate is about equal to the growth in the total network hash rate over the past year, but meaningfully lower than what has been seen over the past four months. So Hut 8 won't be capturing share even though they expand possible capacity. To summarize the production dynamics above, Hut 8's share will be pressured by relatively fast growth in the total network rate relative to their own expansion plans. And any renewed stress in energy prices from the European crisis could force a profitability based curtailment of a portion of the mining fleet, especially if Bitcoin prices remain depressed going into 2023. Lastly, compared to the prior twelve months, Hut 8's Bitcoin equivalent production will be 10-15% lower due to the end of mining on the Ethereum platform. Hut 8's Spiking Costs Per Mined Coin Hut 8's adjusted operating costs per coin, which excludes depreciation, rose from about $13,100 in the first quarter this year, to $18,900 in the second quarter. This metric captures electricity and site operations, but is excluding non-cash depreciation. The average cost of mining each Bitcoin for Q2 2022 was approximately $25,900 [see note] , compared to approximately $24,700 per Bitcoin in Q2 2021. The increase in average cost of mining Bitcoin was primarily due to higher power prices, partially offset by the deployment of a more efficient mining fleet Financial Results for Q2 2022 , hut8mining.com, 8/11/2022 - *note: data in quote is in Canadian dollars. In the table below, compare Hut 8's costs to three close in size mining peers. Note that, unlike these peers, Hut 8 is largely dependent on natural gas pricing, which has been elevated and volatile. Bitfarms ( BITF ) is expanding its sourcing from hydropower to include natural gas in Argentina. However, this source is in the Southern Hemisphere and less connected to the Northern Hemisphere winter supply dynamics. Calendar Q2 Costs Per Mined Coin Adjusted Operating Costs/Coin Adjusted Costs & Expenses/Coin Hut 8 $18,900 $25,400 CleanSpark ( CLSK ) $10,700 $16,800 Bitfarms $11,500 $17,400 HIVE ( HIVE ) $12,600 $15,000 Author calculated from: Hut 8 Q2'22 MDA , - CleanSpark Calendar Q2'22 FORM 10-Q ,- Bitfarms Q2'22 MDA , - Hive Q2'22 MDA - Operating Costs include mining electricity and mining site operations, but exclude depreciation and secondary businesses' electricity and site operations. Expenses include general and administrative costs, but exclude share-based compensation and general costs directly attributable to secondary businesses. Hut 8's Rating: HODL Strategy and Cap to Hash Comparison I don't think it makes sense to sell Bitcoin and then reinvest in equipment that's going to have a payback period that extends post having. And so ultimately, the math would suggest if you sell Bitcoin now, it's going to cost you more to mine it later. CEO Jaime Leverton on Q2 2022 Results, seekingalpha.com, 8/11/22 (link above) Based just on the company's production outlook and pressured margins, Hut 8 shares would not be expected to outperform other names in the sector. This is especially true as the company is trading at a premium market cap compared to these peers. However, Hut 8 has maintained a strong balance sheet, having been able to expand their business without taking on substantial debt, or importantly, selling their mined Bitcoin. The charts below compare Hut 8 to similarly situated Bitcoin miner CleanSpark. Both have somewhat comparable and relatively small net cash/debt positions. Debt Cash Market Cap EV Hut 8 37M 47M $453M $445M CleanSpark 20M 3M $163M $180M CleanSpark Capital Structure - Hut 8 Capital Structure However, CleanSpark has an opposite Bitcoin retention strategy. And if one includes Bitcoin holdings as cash, the enterprise values more closely align. While imperfect, the purpose of this exercise and backing out the value of the Bitcoin holdings is to approximate how much one is paying per EH/s of capacity when investing. Bitcoin Holdings Adjusted EV Yearend Hash Est. Adj. EV per EH/s Hut 8 $189M $205M* 3.5 EH/s $59M CleanSpark $11M $169M 5.0 EH/s $34M Author Computed/Complied from Hut 8 Q2'22 MDA, - CleanSpark Calendar Q2'22 FORM 10-Q (links above) *Note that for fairness, Hut 8's adjusted EV above has been further reduced by 20% to account for the high margin, high-performance computing business which is 11% of revenues, and any possible revenues and earnings the Bitcoin holdings may generate if redeployed for yield. So in the above exercise, a potential purchaser is paying ~75% more for Hut 8's near-future hash capacity when compared to CleanSpark. I like Hut 8's strong HODL strategy, how they have successfully strengthened their balance sheet relative to peers, and the positive sentiment the Bitcoin holdings generate. But at the current market cap, one appears to be overpaying for the mining portion of the business that is increasingly pressured by the growing network hash rate and the company's particular power costs. Hut 8 is no longer a preferred Bitcoin mining play, and I am assigning a hold rating indicative of an expectation that the stock will market and industry perform.

Svetlana Martynova, a senior legal officer at the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, said that a couple of years ago 5% of terrorist attacks were viewed as crypto-financed or linked to digital assets. “Now we’re thinking that it may reach about 20%,"" she said.  Martynova also spoke on the financing of terror at a United Nations Security Council meeting at the Hotel Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai, one of the sites of a Nov. 26, 2008, attack that left 175 people dead and more than 300 wounded.  ""With regards to moving funds, experts agree that cash and other time transfers remain the prevalent methods used by terrorists,"" she said in the address. But ""there was also an increase in their use in combination with new payment methods.""  Those new methods include mobile payment systems and virtual assets, she said. ""Blockchains, cryptocurrencies and crowdfunding sometimes pose a complex money trail for financial investigators to follow. Some of these products can enable anonymous cross-border funds transfers.""  Martynova warned against blanket-type prohibitions. She said it is critical to understand ""the exact nature of the threat"" to develop appropriate responses, which should be ""risk-based, outcome-based, proportional and human-rights law compliant.""

TRUST, which was originally kick-started in the U.S. by the Coinbase (COIN) crypto exchange with help from BitGo, Gemini, Kraken and Fidelity, said earlier this year it had established a footing in Canada and Singapore. As part of its European advancement, the TRUST membership has grown to 67 firms, according to a press release.  Back in mid-2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) ordered crypto service providers to meet its AML guidance, which meant exchanges, trading desks and custodians had to transfer personally identifiable information about their customers along with crypto transactions over a certain threshold.  That FATF action has become known as the Travel Rule.  TRUST, which is one of a number of approaches to crypto AML, is now emerging as the consortium with the most industry weight behind it.  Sascha Rangoonwala, Coinbase's head of its Germany operations, said TRUST now has members from Germany, the U.K., Switzerland, Ireland, Lithuania, Austria and the Netherlands.  “The expansion of the TRUST coalition to Europe marks a significant milestone in Coinbase’s journey to become the global industry-standard solution for Travel Rule compliance,” Rangoonwala said in an email. “Our rapid expansion is a result of TRUST’s ability to adapt to different jurisdictions' Travel Rule requirements while also prioritizing customer privacy and security.”  Read more: The Perverse Impacts of the Anti-Money-Laundering System",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/31/coinbase-backed-anti-money-laundering-group-expands-into-europe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/17eae4f8393f17988c60b2b8b77fe67e16a7797b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415131,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXWR7,1667221200,Pantera Capital Leads $10M Funding Round for Crypto Wallet Firm Braavos,"Crypto wallet Braavos has raised a $10 million in a funding round led by crypto-focused investment giant Pantera Capital. Other investors included Road Capital, BH Digital, DCVC, Crypto.com, Matrixport, and StarkNet creator Starkware, which itself was valued at $8 billion during a $100 million funding round in May.  Pantera is the world's largest crypto hedge fund by assets under management. It was founded in 2003 by Dan Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs derivatives trader who became chief financial officer of Tiger Global Management, another big asset-management firm.  Braavos develops crypto wallets, which give the holder access to the digital assets stored within. Custodial wallets put the keys, or passwords, in the hands of a centralized company that promises security and offers an easy-to-use interface for users. Self-custody keeps the keys with the user, but the more complicated onboarding process can discourage new crypto users.  Braavos, which was founded earlier this year, aims to offer self-custody in a more user-friendly way. The Tel Aviv, Israel-based firm has built its all-in-one crypto product on StarkNet, a layer 2 blockchain that addresses the scalability issues of the Ethereum blockchain by using a technology called zero-knowledge rollup that improves transaction speeds and lowers fees.  Available as a web browser and mobile app for iOS and Android devices, Braavos combines the traditional asset storage and transfer options of a self-custody wallet with a built-in crypto exchange, access to decentralized applications and a Transaction Explainer that can help new crypto traders understand and review transactions.  “Crypto today is still too technical and complex for many users – requiring them to deal with seed phrases and security keys, suffer from low error tolerance, and educate themselves on non-trivial DeFi (decentralized-finance) protocols. Our mission is to eliminate these high friction hurdles and provide users with the smooth experience they deserve, while preserving the core crypto values of decentralization and self-custody,” Braavos CEO Motty Lavie said in the press release, Lavie co-founded the startup with software engineers Abraham Makovetsky and Yoav Gaziel.  In the near term, the startup plans to launch a “forgot password” feature that would eliminate the reliance on complex seed phrases, multi-factor authentication for additional security and integrated DeFi capabilities to help users easily earn yield from within the wallet.

42411701,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfJZU,1667221174,Bitcoin White Paper Celebrates 14th Birthday,"“I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.” Those were the words pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto used to greet the world some 14 years ago in an email releasing the Bitcoin white paper.  To this day, nobody still knows who Satoshi is. Since April 23, 2011, nobody has heard from him/her/them after they signed off an email saying,  I’ve moved on to other things. It’s in good hands with Gavin and everyone.  A technical description, the Bitcoin white paper was the first document to outline the principles of a cryptographically secured, trustless, peer-to-peer electronic payment system that was fundamentally designed to be transparent and censorship-resistant, as well as put financial control back in the hands of the individual. At that time, the world was gripped by a financial crisis catalyzed by excessive speculation in the financial markets and banks risking millions of dollars worth of depositors' money.  This document lay the foundation for what is generally considered the first functional digital currency powered by a distributed ledger technology called blockchain.  One of the many ground-breaking elements of Satoshi’s electronic payment system was that it solved the long-standing “double-spend” problem that plagued cashless spending. Through the implementation of time-stamped transactions that are unanimously verified by a distributed network of validators, it was no longer possible for a person to spend the same funds twice.  The white paper was released under an MIT public license in 2008 for all to learn from, share and enjoy. Read the bitcoin white paper here.  Read More: How Can Satoshi Nakamoto Have a Birthday?

It appears that the Ethereum blockchain's recent technological overhaul (aka the “Merge”) is beginning to have a bullish effect on the token price.ETH rose over 16% in the seven days up to Sunday, topping bitcoin's (BTC) 5% rise.  Furious dogecoin trading over the weekend saw the Shiba Inu-themed coin reach a market capitalization of over $10 billion, almost doubling its value over what it was a week ago and making it one of the most liquidated coins among futures that track major cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin futures racked up over $89 million in liquidations since Friday, the same day Elon Musk – the self-proclaimed “dogefather” – confirmed his purchase of social network Twitter (TWTR).  Hong Kong is warming up to digital assets, according to a statement the city’s Legislative Council released to kick off FinTech week. The government is “open to the possibility” of virtual-asset exchange traded funds as well as tokenized securities, the statement says, pledging to protect investors with the right regulatory framework. The government says it’s ready to engage with virtual-asset service providers and invite them to the city.  Chart of the Day  The above chart shows ether's daily price action going back to September 2021.  Ether has recently outperformed bitcoin on the back of positive changes in demand-supply dynamics and now looks set to rise past a descending trendline, characterizing the 12-month bear market.

42415150,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXXo1,1667218932,Bitcoin Options Market Signals Bottom as Skews Climb to Zero,"The options market tracking bitcoin (BTC) suggests that the once-overwhelming fear of an extended slide has subsided, a sign that the worst may be over for the price of the cryptocurrency.  For the first time since March, both long-term and short-term skews have climbed to zero, which indicates that the demand for puts or downside protection relative to calls or bullish bets has weakened. Skew measures the spread between the implied volatility of calls and puts.  A call option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option gives the right to sell. Implied volatility refers to expectations for price turbulence over a particular period and is influenced by demand for options.  So, a positive call-put skew indicates greater demand for calls, while a negative skew implies bias for puts. A neutral or near zero skew is a sign the demand for bullish and bearish bets is balanced.  ""The market sentiment has returned to neutral after a long time,"" Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset-management firm Blofin, told CoinDesk. ""That's one of the important signals that the market may have found a bottom.""  The 30-, 90- and 180-day skews have returned to near zero for the first time since late March/early April. The 60-day skew has turned marginally positive, a hint of a bias for calls expiring in two months.  The sentiment has flipped from negative to neutral amid hopes that the Federal Reserve will slow down its pace of monetary tightening starting in December. The Fed has raised rates by 300 basis points this year in an effort to control inflation, putting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, under pressure.  ""Suppose the Fed eventually chooses to ease monetary policy gradually. In that case, we may witness a gradual recovery in the market in recent months,"" Ardern said.  The Fed is likely to raise rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday and signal a step down to 50 basis points in December.  That said, it's still too early to bet on a price rally by purchasing call options, according to options analytics firm Genesis Volatility.  ""Spot prices DO INDEED look constructively bullish … but that said, Q4-22 doesn’t resemble the Q4-20 environment, where buying call exposure was the right move to make,"" Gregoire Magadini, CEO of Genesis Volatility, said in a weekly newsletter. ""[build] Tactial long but don't ape into unhedged calls.""  According to Magadini, the Fed's forward guidance for future hikes will be the big unknown. ""Global central banks are starting to soften their hawkish tone, but Powell may not follow suit,"" he said, referring to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.

42415136,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXWmL,1667216656,India's Central Bank to Start Wholesale CBDC Pilot Nov. 1,"India's central bank will introduce a pilot wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) Nov. 1, and a retail version will start within a month. In a statement, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said the use case for the wholesale digital rupee is the ""settlement of secondary market transactions in government securities"" because it would reduce transaction costs.  Nine prominent banks have been identified for participation in the pilot. These are State Bank of India (SBIN), Bank of Baroda (BANKBARODA), Union Bank of India (UNIONBANK), HDFC Bank (HDFCBANK), ICICI Bank (ICICIBANK), Kotak Mahindra Bank (KOTAKBANK), Yes Bank (YESBANK), IDFC First Bank (IDFCFIRSTB) and HSBC (HSBA).  The RBI said a pilot of the retail version is planned for launch within a month in select locations in closed user groups comprising customers and merchants. The bank published a 50-page concept note for the introduction of a central bank digital currency earlier this month.  Since early 2021 it's been known that 80% of central banks around the world are exploring CBDCs. Recently, Australia's Central Bank started a CBDC research project and announced plans to complete the pilot by mid-2023. The central banks of Israel, Norway and Sweden have teamed up to explore retail CBDC.  The Bank of International Settlements has also conducted a project with the central banks of Hong Kong, China, the United Arab Emirates and Thailand to study CBDCs and their possible role in cross-border payments and multi-CBDC transactions. The six-week pilot project successfully had 20 different commercial banks conduct over 160 payments worth around a total of $22 million.  India will have a prominent role in framing global crypto regulation when it takes over the G-20 group presidency for one year, starting from Dec. 1, 2022, until Nov. 30, 2023. The nation's finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has said crypto will be part of the agenda.  Sitharaman has said that she seeks to arrive at a framework or a standard operating procedure after discussions with G-20 members and institutions based on their studies and research around the topic. ""We would definitely want to collate all this and do a bit of study and then bring it on to the table of the G-20 so that members can discuss it and hopefully arrive at a framework or SOP (standard operating procedure) so that globally, countries can have a technology-driven regulatory framework,"" she said.  In January 2022, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought global cooperation to tackle the challenges posed by cryptocurrencies. Later in July, the Finance Minister said no legislation is possible without significant international collaboration while re-stating the RBI's known stance to parliament – ban cryptocurrencies to avoid a destabilising effect on monetary and fiscal stability.

Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Kondux received 209 ether (ETH), or 95% of the stolen funds, while Feg Token received 548 ether.  Caw Coin, which took the biggest hit during the exploit, received over $5 million worth of DAI and 74.6 billion CAW, its native tokens.

42415128,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXWGV,1667214000,"AMD, Seagate and EY Join Protocol Labs-led Decentralized Storage Alliance","Protocol Labs, the company behind the decentralized file-sharing protocol Filecoin, announced an alliance that aims to help more companies make the transition to Web3 from Web2.  The industry organization has a trio of heavy-hitters as founding partners: computer hardware giant Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), storage device maker Seagate and Big 4 accounting and consulting firm Ernst & Young (EY).  Filecoin essentially allows users to buy or sell computer storage on a network that offers decentralized storage of data and files. The service is meant to act as an alternative to centralized storage providers like Amazon Web Services.  The Decentralized Storage Alliance, launched in conjunction with the nonprofit Filecoin Foundation, will work to establish development standards that would help decentralized storage solutions meet the needs of enterprise customers, including making it easier for data centers to onboard onto a decentralized network. Working groups will be created to solve other specific issues that could slow the transition from Web2 to Web3.  “As the global data and storage markets are accelerating, there is a lag in the adoption of decentralized storage technologies,” James Canterbury, partner and principal at EY Blockchain, said in the press release.  The founding partners aren’t new to the crypto space. AMD’s central and graphics processing units (CPU and GPU) have long been used by crypto miners. Seagate experienced a sales surge last year due to Chia, a blockchain that utilizes the unused computer storage space of miners to validate the network. EY announced a partnership with the Polygon protocol in Sept. 2021 to deploy its own products on the Ethereum blockchain. The first of those products – a supply chain manager – launched earlier this year.  “We see decentralized storage as an opportunity to diversify and add resilience to our data infrastructure,” Canterbury continued. “And we see the alliance as a crucial piece of this – enabling adoption of decentralized storage and cohesion across the broader industry.""

DAXA, the Digital Asset Exchange Joint Association, is the country's self-regulating organization that oversees the legal aspects of crypto offerings.  WeMade said in a Sunday post that it accidentally left out additional tokens issued to partners and funds that were meant to increase participation in the WeMade ecosystem.  “We acknowledge that 1) there may be some time differences between WEMIX Quarterly report posting and real-time circulating supply, and 2) there was some insufficient update of the circulating supply of CoinMarketCap and communication with the exchanges,” WeMade said.  “As more and more partners believe and participate in the future of WEMIX and the development of the ecosystem, a certain amount of WEMIX was inevitably supplied at each partnership/contract signing depending on the purpose or form of the cooperative model,” WeMade explained.

42415149,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXXtK,1667204966,"Ether Sees Biggest Weekly Gain in 3 Months, ETH-BTC Rally to Continue","Smart contract platform Ethereum's recent technological overhaul is beginning to have an intended bullish effect on its native token ether's (ETH) price.  ETH rose over 16% in the seven days to Oct. 30, its best weekly percentage price gain since mid-July, overshadowing bitcoin's (BTC) 5% rise, CoinDesk data show.  ""Both major coins are having their moment, but since people are still adjusting to ether's recent tokenomics changes, momentum is still stronger there for now,"" Jordi Alexander, chief investment officer at proprietary trading firm Seleni Capital, said.  On Sept. 15, Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism, replacing miners with validators, who explicitly lock capital in the form of ETH on the platform as entities responsible for confirming transactions.  Since the switch, ether's supply has increased by 1,300 tokens. The net-supply increase would have been more than 481,000 had the blockchain continued to use the PoW mechanism.  Ether's net issuance, also known as annualized inflation rate, has declined from 3.6% to nearly 0%, falling below bitcoin's 1.7%, according to data sourced from ultrasound.money.  Meanwhile, data from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows ether's net issuance has actually declined below zero. In other words, ether has turned deflationary – a coin with supply decreasing over time instead of increasing. That's at a time when investors worldwide are facing a shortage of assets that could protect their money from rampant inflation.  Ether's outperformance likely to continue  The ether-bitcoin ratio, measuring ether's price in bitcoin terms, rose 10% last week, registering the biggest gain since July. The ratio's uptrend could continue, according to prominent traders.  ""Ether may continue to outperform bitcoin as ETH's annual issuance continues to fall rapidly. Therefore, thanks to the transaction fee burn mechanism, any increase in on-chain activity should bring Ethereum firmly into deflationary issuance territory and may have a substantial outsized effect on [ether’s] price,"" Josh Olszweicz, head of research at digital asset fund manager Valkyrie Investments, told CoinDesk.  Read More: Surging Popularity of Ethereum Staking Keeps Lid on Yields  In August last year, Ethereum activated a mechanism to burn a portion of transaction fees paid in ETH by users, essentially tying the number of ETH burned or taken out of circulation with the network usage.  So, as Olszweicz said, an increase in network usage will further skew demand-supply dynamics in favor of ether bulls. Since early August last year, over 2.6 million ETH worth $8.65 billion has been taken out of circulation, according to ethburned.info.  Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Ledger Prime, said ether's deflationary appeal would get stronger overtime, attracting investors.  ""A lot of sidelined capital is more attracted to ETH storyline than BTC at the moment,"" Tang said. ""I expect ETH to maintain lead over BTC, as ETH's deflationary nature will slowly be felt over time.""  Tang added that ""bitcoin would continue to face supply overhang from miners (more of a consistent drip of supply as opposed to large blocks) with bitcoin price here [around $20,000].""  Ether's switch to PoS has permanently freed the market from daily miner selling. According to Cumberland, Ethereum miners used to sell $40 million worth of ether daily. Bitcoin continues to use the PoW mechanism, where miners solve complex algorithmic puzzles to validate transactions in return for rewards paid in BTC. Miners typically liquidate coins regularly to fund their operations.  Macro risks persist  While ether's fundamentals favor a continued rally, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to adverse macroeconomic factors.  The Federal Reserve is widely expected to deliver its fourth straight 75 basis point interest rate hike on Wednesday and signal a less aggressive approach for the coming months. The expectations for the so-called Fed pivot in favor of slower tightening have brought life back to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  However, selling pressure may return if the so-called Fed pivot in favor of slower tightening is accompanied by a strong-worded message, saying rates could remain higher for longer.  The Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos, widely considered the Fed mouthpiece, published an article over the weekend saying the central bank could holder rates higher for longer as consumers and businesses are providing less sensitive to ongoing monetary tightening. The Fed has raised rates by 300 basis points this year, roiling asset markets.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/31/ether-sees-biggest-weekly-gain-in-3-months-outperformance-relative-to-btc-likely-to-continue,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c10841f16a5affeb7a127b06bee7450b66b5ad5e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Huobi said users can still exchange HUSD tokens for tether (USDT), the industry's largest stablecoin by market cap.  Stablecoins are designed to mirror the value of other assets, typically fiat currencies like the dollar, pound sterling or euro. The stablecoin sector was shaken up earlier this year following the collapse of terraUSD (UST), which prompted an implosion of the entire $60 billion Terra ecosystem.  HUSD, which is issued by Stable Universal, also suffered issues earlier this year when it began to fluctuate away from its peg.  Tron founder Justin Sun has taken a senior role at Huobi in recent weeks and one of the immediate changes he is making is shifting volume to his own stablecoin, USDD. While Huobi didn't issue HUSD, it was active in marketing the token since its launch in 2018.  HUSD currently has a market cap of just $63 million, down significantly from its all-time high of over $1 billion in 2021.

42415144,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXXNU,1667194732,"Hong Kong Government Reconsiders Stance on Virtual Asset ETFs, Tokenized Securities, Retail Investors","HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s Financial Services and Treasury Bureau issued a policy statement on virtual assets at the opening of the city's flagship tech conference Hong Kong FinTech Week on Monday.  Hong Kong is “ready to engage” with global virtual asset service providers and invite them to the city, the statement says. The jurisdiction's Legislative Council is currently reviewing Hong Kong's new VASP licensing regime as part of proposed amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance. The regime is set to come into effect March 1 next year.  Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will conduct a public consultation on how retail investors may be given a “suitable degree of access to virtual assets"" to licensed exchanges, according to the policy statement.  Currently, retail customers can trade crypto on unlicensed exchanges such as Binance. After the VASP regime takes effect, only VASP licensed exchanges can offer any crypto services, and some might be able to offer crypto services to retail customers.  The policy statement adds that Hong Kong is “open to the possibility” of having exchange-traded funds on virtual assets, pledging to enhance investor protection and ensure suitable regulatory arrangements are in place.  “The SFC has been actively looking to set up a regime to authorize ETFs [that] provide exposure to mainstream virtual assets with appropriate investment guardrails,” Securities and Futures Commission Deputy Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung said at Hong Kong FinTech Week.  Leung added that virtual assets futures ETFs will be subject to additional requirements related to management company, investment strategy, disclosure and investor education. In the initial stage, the underlying assets will be confined to bitcoin futures and ether futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Leung said.  In her speech, Leung also announced changes to how the SFC views tokenized securities. The SFC takes the view that tokenized securities should be treated in a similar way to existing financial instruments, she said. The SFC will no longer classify tokenized securities as complex products just because they are issued on the blockchain, Leung said.  If proper safeguards are put in place, the SFC is prepared to allow retail access, Leung said. The SFC is working on a circular to set out changes to the security token regime in detail.  Given differences between traditional assets and virtual assets, the government is open to future review on property rights for tokenized assets and the legality of smart contracts, the statement says.  “We were sometimes a bit hesitant or even resistant wondering how new creatures like crypto, stablecoins, [decentralized finance] or other blockchain-based innovations can fit into mainstream finance,” Hong Kong Monetary Authority CEO Eddie Yue said at Hong Kong FinTech Week.  Yue said that it had become apparent that the technologies underpinning them will “develop very nicely in a healthy financial system like Hong Kong.”  Hong Kong is exploring pilot projects on non-fungible token issuance for Hong Kong FinTech Week, green bond tokenisation and eHKD, the policy statement says.  Its virtual asset ecosystem could realize use cases including trading arts and collectibles, tokenizing vintage goods and tokenizing debt securities, the statement says.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB,Lavender Au,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/31/hong-kong-govt-reconsiders-stance-on-virtual-asset-etfs-tokenised-securities-and-retail-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6939c5476979d69c7e8506a67bd2bcfc6e5f4785-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dogecoin futures racked up over $89 million in liquidations since Friday amid volatile trading as Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter was confirmed. Some $52 million of those figures originated from short traders, or bets against a token’s price rise.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Dogecoin liquidations were the highest among all cryptocurrencies in the past 24 hours at over $27 million. Futures tracking ether and bitcoin, which usually see the largest figures, racked up a relatively lesser $14 million and $12 million in losses respectively.  The liquidations may have contributed to a short squeeze, as dogecoin prices doubled from nearly 7 cents on Friday to over 15 cents on Sunday morning. Prices retreated to 11 cents on Monday at writing time.  There’s some $647 billion of open interest on dogecoin futures as of Monday. Open interest, or the number of contracts outstanding and not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade.  Elsewhere, on-chain transactions on the Dogecoin system spiked from 25,000 per day last week to over 37,000 as of Monday morning, data from block explorers show.  Musk has been a major supporter of DOGE, which has become a proxy for sentiment about him.

42415147,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXXdP,1667177285,Surging Popularity of Ethereum Staking Keeps Lid on Yields,"Ethereum staking appears to be the new favorite way for crypto traders to capture yield – so popular, in fact, that it’s driving the yields lower.  That’s a consequence of the formula used to calculate the yields under the Ethereum blockchain’s month-old “proof-of-stake” model: The staking yields are awarded in ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. And the total amount of ether available for staking yields is divided between all the accounts that are staking. So the more ether that’s sent to the blockchain for staking, the lower the percentage that’s available for each staker.  According to Coinbase Institutional, the staking yield post-Merge looks to be about 4%- 5%, well below the 9%-12% that the analysts initially forecast.  One problem for now, according to crypto analysts, is that investors can’t take immediately their ether out – so they’re stuck in the protocol even as the staking yields keep declining. The withdrawal option won’t really become available until Ethereum’s next significant upgrade, ""Shanghai,” expected to occur in 2023.  “You can only put stake in but can’t take stake out,” said Nick Hotz, vice president of research at the digital-asset management firm Arca Funds.  So unlike in traditional bond markets, where yields can rise or fall based on supply and demand, the Ethereum staking yield isn’t “responsive.”  “In the future, that will be responsive, and it looks a lot more like a bond market, where there are more interest generated if there's more going on in the economy,” Hotz said.  According to data from Dune Analytics, more than 14 million ether, worth over $2 billion, are currently being staked on the Ethereum blockchain, including a spike in deposits during the third quarter, when the shift to the proof-of-stake model took effect, known as the Merge. That amount of ether staked is up 7.5% from the end of the second quarter.  The Merge was intended to make the Ethereum blockchain more energy efficient than its former “proof-of-work” model – also the same system that the Bitcoin blockchain uses.  Under the proof-of-stake system, the blockchain’s security – making sure transactions go through as intended and that the cryptocurrency is safe – is provided by “validators” who stake their ether as a sort of guarantee. Becoming a validator or staker requires at least 32 ETH (about $50,600 worth) to be locked up on the blockchain.  But as more stakers rush in and more ETH is deposited, the yield gets spread out more thinly.  Hotz said that Ethereum’s staking yield is typically determined by four variables: gross ETH issuance, transaction fees generated per day by Ethereum, burning rate and the amount of ETH being staked.  The denominator growing  There’s a formula, in fact. The annualized staking yield is: [annual gross ETH issuance + annual fees * (1-% of fees burned)]/average ETH staked over the year.  In other words: The amount of ether staked is in the denominator of the fraction. So as the number gets bigger, the yield shrinks.  At the current level, the Ethereum staking yield is roughly on par with that of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield, which topped 4.2% this year, the highest level since 2008.  The takeaway is that stakers are apparently content to collect roughly the same yield by sticking their money into the Ethereum blockchain as by investing in triple-A-rated U.S. government bonds, considered among the world’s safest investments.  The staking growth is “a sign that traders find it a reliable alternative to the traditional markets,” Alan Goldberg, market analyst at BestBrokers, said in a note.  “Making a deposit for a year without access to your funds is a risky move, especially if the funds are in crypto,"" said Goldberg. “However, traders continue to stake ... It just proves that many traders feel secure with Ethereum.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/31/surging-popularity-of-ethereum-staking-keeps-lid-on-yields,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c5a253acfede39012d282e82fa00a50cf8cf434-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
