42375388,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7dQt,1643498009,The Unhosted Crypto Wallet Rule Is Back,"A controversial proposed rule that would enforce know-your-customer rules on unhosted or self-hosted crypto wallets may again be under consideration by the U.S. federal government.  The rule was first proposed at the end of 2020 by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S. money laundering watchdog. If enacted, crypto exchanges would be required to collect names and home addresses, among other personal details, from anyone hoping to transfer cryptocurrencies to their own private wallets.  Industry advocates said they were concerned the rules might be impossible for certain wallets to comply with because they are not controlled by people and therefore are not tied to this personal information. Others were also concerned the compliance requirement might be overly burdensome for individuals.  The rule was driven by then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin rather than FinCEN itself. The original proposal was published on the Treasury Department's website, not FinCEN's. The watchdog only posted the proposed rule when the comment period was extended.  The Treasury Department, which is now overseen by Secretary Janet Yellen, revealed the rule might be considered in this semiannual agenda of regulations, set to be formally published in the Federal Register on Jan. 31. The agenda outlines priorities for the Treasury Department, but it does not indicate that the rules will actually be implemented, or that they will be implemented as-is. Rather, the agenda is a tool that signals things Treasury will work on over the next six months.  ""FinCEN is proposing to amend the regulations implementing the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) to require banks and money service businesses (MSB) to submit reports, keep records and verify the identity of customers in relation to transactions involving convertible virtual currency (CVC) or digital assets with legal tender status ('legal tender digital assets' or 'LTDA') held in unhosted wallets, or held in wallets hosted in a jurisdiction identified by FinCEN,"" the document said.  A timetable in the section suggests FinCEN aims to finalize the rule by the end of August, if it chooses to finalize it.  Read more: The Mnuchin Files: New Documents Shed Light on Trump-Era Crypto Policy  Split rule  The proposed rule originally had an unusually short 15-day comment period, further stirring controversy among industry advocates. Typically comment periods are between 30 and 90 days, though some rules may have 120-day comment periods.  In public notices, FinCEN twice extended the comment period, first for another 15 days and later for a further 60 days.  In that first extension, FinCEN treated the rule's provisions as two separate issues. One of these provisions sought to impose currency transaction report (CTR) rules on crypto transactions to unhosted wallets. Financial institutions currently file CTRs for customers who transact with over $10,000 in a single day.  The personal data rule, referred to as the ""counterparty data collection rule,"" would apply to customers transferring over $3,000 in crypto per day to private wallets.  It is this second rule that led to industry backlash, including several thousand comments filed as a response. FinCEN may need to issue a new comment period to address these responses before implementing the counterparty data collection rule.  A FinCEN spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment on whether the agency is considering the overall rule or the provisions individually. However, a link on the Federal Register page leads to the original proposed rule from Dec. 23, 2020.  Defining 'money'  The Federal Reserve and FinCEN also plan to ""clarify the meaning of 'money'"" under the Bank Secrecy Act as it pertains to digital assets, ensuring that digital asset transactions are subject to the same BSA rules their fiat counterparts might be.  ""The Agencies intend that the revised proposal will ensure that the rules apply to domestic and cross-border transactions involving convertible virtual currency, which is a medium of exchange (such as cryptocurrency) that either has an equivalent value as currency, or acts as a substitute for currency, but lacks legal tender status,"" the document said.  Further, the BSA rules will also apply to any digital asset transactions that ""have legal tender status,"" the document said.

42390151,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUu7fn,1643478257,Bitcoin Protects Privacy and Fights Oppression,"Surveillance is power, as authoritarian regimes across history have known. The emergence of the internet in the late 20th century made surveillance easier than ever by creating a historically unprecedented repository of information about individuals and organizations stored on servers throughout the world.  Over the years the dangers of the internet’s panopticon have pushed many ordinary people to fight back – advocating for regulation via their governments where possible, but also by developing their own technological defenses, including popular tools like encrypted email and messaging platforms. It is no exaggeration to say that without privacy individual freedoms cannot long survive. And the battle for privacy in the digital age is now headed to its newest and perhaps most consequential stage with the emergence of central bank digital currencies, (CBDC).  This post is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week.  CBDCs are central government’s attempts to turn blockchain technology to its own use, utilizing its efficiencies for storing and transferring value but also through the social control via surveillance that it makes possible. CBDCs have clear benefits over the analog financial system, but alongside the promise of increased financial access and efficiency they also expose citizens to a level of potential surveillance inconceivable in the past.  An authoritarian government administering a CBDC would have total oversight of every transaction anywhere on Earth using that currency, as well as the ability to freeze, expropriate or even force-spend funds owned by private individuals as it deemed fit. The prospect of such state-controlled currencies, like the digital yuan already being rolled out in China, also highlights why a technology like Bitcoin might wind up in future being the only insurance against financial repression in authoritarian countries, and even in democracies like the United States.  The gravity of this issue, as it pertains to privacy and surveillance, is especially clear to me.  As a journalist I spent years reporting on classified documents provided by National Security Agency (NSA) whistle-blower Edward Snowden. The documents showed in incredible detail the powers the U.S. government had gained to surveil and, by extension, control the lives of individuals whose communications fell under its massive global dragnet.  Decentralized currencies like bitcoin represent a possible safe haven against future government overreach in a world built upon CBDCs.  Behind the scenes the NSA had developed the power to collect essentially any private message or metadata it sought from devices around the world, including from American citizens who had never suspected the level of power their government privately held over them. Surveillance can ruin lives, and I have seen up close the impact it can have on innocent people caught up in a digital dragnet.  CBDCs have the potential to supercharge the surveillance power created by the internet even further. Whereas Web 2 revolutionized how information could be created and spread, Web 3 will do the same for the creation and dissemination of economic value. Governments will seek to have as tight a control as possible over this, just as they did with the internet. The prospect of the government in a country like China having near-total ability to monitor and manipulate the information its citizens see has been serious enough but, as soon seems possible, it gains the same level of control over people’s ability to conduct even the smallest economic activity, we will be in an altogether new world of repression.  Many countries around the world are already following China’s lead in developing their own CBDC projects, including the United States with a digital dollar. Americans will likely expect that their government will act in good faith in how it administers such a currency, creating and enforcing regulations that protect their privacy and freedom. But as the Snowden documents have already shown, assumptions of good faith are not particularly durable. Politics can help secure rights, but it’s not enough. Just as encrypted email and messaging platforms give individuals a robust personal defense against surveillance abuse, decentralized currencies like bitcoin represent a possible safe haven against future government overreach in a world built upon CBDCs.  The debate now taking place over the future role of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rarely takes the issue of privacy in the digital age into account. Bitcoin is often accused by critics of having no worthwhile use case or for serving as a tool for criminals and terrorists to conceal their activity. But similar accusations were often leveled against encrypted email in the past. While it’s true that criminals sometimes also benefit from the existence of privacy, that same privacy is what allows the vast majority of law-abiding citizens to preserve their civil liberties.  Counting on regulation alone to do the job of protecting privacy on its own seems like a poor wager, given that regulation has failed to ensure such protections in democracies like the United States. Such a prospect of benevolent governance does not even notionally exist in undemocratic countries. It is not hard to imagine a future coming where bitcoin and other currencies are the only safe harbor for people fleeing government abuses that have, sadly, proven to be common across the world.  In 1975, describing an analog age of spying that involved phone taps and physical bugging that we would now consider quaint, Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho) warned of the dangers of the information surveillance regime already growing in the United States. The surveillance power of the government and its security agencies could “at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left. Such is the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter. There would be no place to hide,” he said.  Church spelled out what this would mean for democracy. If a dictator were to ever take power in the United States, that person could use surveillance “to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back.""  The government now has surveillance powers beyond what Sen. Church could ever dream of then, and those powers are on the cusp of becoming even more powerful as digital currencies rise to prominence. These state-backed digital currencies will be the next battleground in the fight over privacy, and no weapon can be discarded in defense against their possible abuse.  Bitcoin is not exempt from critique, but because of its decentralized protocol it is the most likely bet to offer strong resistance against a future financial panopticon. Those who have known what it is like to have their freedoms quashed by regimes of surveillance and social control, in the United States and abroad, know the potential virtues of censorship-resistance currency cannot be lightly dismissed.  Neither bitcoin nor cryptography in general can be a wholesale substitute for politics. But they offer a practical way to protect the most vulnerable from predation in the digital age.

42390149,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bUu7VX,1643476448,Wonderland's (and DeFi's) Anonymity Problem,"DeFi (and the Canadian crypto community, especially) woke up yesterday to a pretty terrible headline. We learned that “Sifu,” who goes by the handle @OxSifu, a core member and chief financial officer of decentralized finance protocol Wonderland, was Michael Patryn (also known sometimes as Omar Dhanani), an apparent co-founder of failed, infamous (to put it lightly) Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX.  This discovery was equally shocking to me. As a young upstart in Canadian crypto circles in 2010, I was exposed to Patryn, an experience I was quoted on in an investigative piece in Vanity Fair in 2019. Following yesterday's news, where an anonymous team member of a leading DeFi protocol was outed as a career criminal, I find myself thinking deeply on the topic of anonymity, reputation and trust in DeFi, an industry where so much blind faith is put into one's personal history, motives, and ideals.  Joseph Weinberg was an early investor in Bitcoin in 2010 and director at Coinsetter until its acquisition by Kraken in 2016. Currently, Weinberg is the co-founder of Shyft Network, the blockchain-based trust network that reclaims trust, credibility and identity. This article is part of CoinDesk's Privacy Week series.  As someone who was there for Canadian crypto’s early days, I can tell you that we were operating truly in the unknown in those first years. In that environment, actors emerged who today our space wouldn’t tolerate. I won’t speak or reveal more on Michael/Omar for personal security reasons, but the point isn’t about him; it's about the moral compass we must demand and a requirement to fight for the betterment of our ecosystem – and humanity.  Is total anonymity practical in a space where bad actors inevitably exist? When we de-anonymize founders, does DeFi adoption suffer? How do we move forward when situations like Wonderland bring back memories of what we've fought so hard to change since 2013? These are all questions I'm asking myself right now. Below, I also want to share what I think could become some answers – and a path forward for improving trust in DeFi.  The risks of anonymity in DeFi  I'm not going to argue against anonymity in DeFi, but rather share some ways in which pseudo-anonymity – and reputation – can protect against bad actors like Patryn being given the keys to users' funds. While Quadriga was a centralized exchange (sole ownership), Wonderland’s treasury is still in the hands of core key signers – a situation of pseudo-custody, where risk becomes a factor. Smart contracts may be self-executing, but individuals controlling funds are independent actors.  It's here where human intervention becomes an issue. The community puts its faith in the idea that those in contact with their money will do the right thing. Most of the time, it works. Until it doesn't. Would you want to invest in a project with Chef Nomi of SushiSwap, the infamous co-founder who suddenly liquidated his holdings and caused the token to crash?  Read more: 'I F**ked Up': SushiSwap Creator Chef Nomi Returns $14M Dev Fund  Anonymous teams are not subject to background checks, credit checks or a variety of security checks that ensure individuals don't have criminal records or are on sanctioned watch lists. As DeFi grows and the ecosystem seeks institutional adoption and a wider set of market participants, with great power comes great responsibility.  In Bitcoin and Ethereum, where automatic rule enforcement is based on consensus, individuals themselves don't matter as much – they don't have the extra abilities to do something bad.  It's no surprise, therefore, that recent guidance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) focused so much on DeFi. FATF made the argument that key signers are in control of funds, essentially making them regulated entities, whereas decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) can (and probably will) be categorized as virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to some degree over the coming years.  Read more: What FATF’s Latest Guidance Means for DeFi, Stablecoins and Self-Hosted Wallets  This guidance was intentionally left open-ended and broad so regulators can choose how they approach these topics. If we allow bad actors to hold power in DeFi protocols anonymously, growing regulation would raise many red flags and taint asset pools and institutional confidence.  The power of attested reputation  What we must do as a community is think through some of these issues along the lines of social reputation and trust. We know people are not keen on giving up their identities, and we are here fighting for freedom and openness after all. Instead, again, we put faith in people. In the case of Patryn, that's what happened. We let recent actions speak louder than overall reputation. This is a failure of trust and our social responsibility as an industry.  The future I would like to see for DeFi, and the road toward mass adoption of Institutional DeFi, would replace total anonymity with pseudo-anonymity based on the power and utility of attestations.  Pseudo-anonymity is the concept of revealing parts of oneself and partially disclosing information essential to people. On-chain, we can attest to someone's background record without ever knowing their names, revealing protected personal information (PPI) or doxxing someone. We can ""blindly"" determine who people are and what they have done, and then reveal those answers to those who know them – all without giving up identity.  Choice and trade-offs  Crypto isn't forgiving. In a trustless ecosystem, the only thing we have is the trust we create and the integrity we maintain. We must integrate systems to increase confidence in the anonymous. The irony of trustless systems is that the layers above code-enforced execution require trust. If DeFi continues to grow, we need to take a step back and ask ourselves how we can allow it to engage interoperably with anonymous systems and people.  The promise of DeFi is open, but I believe the true endgame is where we have a slightly retrofitted reality from what we are experiencing today. What makes DeFi magnificent to some is currently leading to critical breakdowns in the basic risk requirements of the financial system: anti-money laundering, data coordination, and reconciliation, layered preferential de-anonymity (pseudo-anonymity).  Read more: The Privacy That DeFi Needs to Succeed  We can all say, ""But Satoshi believed"" but, again, this isn't Bitcoin, it isn't the base layer. To say ""anonymous-everything"" is the opposite of what freedom is about: choice and trade-offs. These systems allow us to start anonymously and make trade-offs in order to optimize or enable other services in better working order (i.e., centralized exchanges). Bitcoin and the networks that came after it, like Ethereum, were not built foundationally to be anonymous systems. They were designed to give us censorship-resistant transparency.  Don't get me wrong: I hope to live in a future where we are fully anonymous, and everything is “privacy by design” – but until then, I'm working with reality as a blend of the world we have grown up in and the one we are creating.  The crypto space was designed to give us all freedom of choice and a new paradigm in building options and levels of freedom. Those freedoms should be ours to decide on, and every user in our ecosystem today already makes those trade-off decisions every day.  To truly walk that walk, we need to understand what other people want in their toolbox of choices. Institutions, for example, want to know with whom they are doing business; governments want to know we are not laundering money or financing terrorists. Supporters of a DeFi project want to know that it isn’t tied to someone who has notoriously acted in bad faith to innocent people who don’t deserve it. I know individuals who were hurt by Quadriga, and early crypto people like myself knew to never hold assets there because of what we knew.  In DeFi and crypto, insider knowledge and shadow games shouldn’t be what keep people safe from bad actors anymore – that era of our space has passed. Today, regulators are responding to people's actions as a demonstration of next-generation innovation and the future you are building. We are all on center stage right now. We've come so far since the early days of the Wild Wild West, and the actions we take now will forever be cemented in the history books and rules created in response to our efforts.  Let's not go back.

The move began in January and has already shown promising results for the project, with the second phase to be deployed in February. It announced that it has transferred the Merkle Proof and minting functions from the Ethereum network over to the Polygon network, allowing for NFT minting at low fees. Furthermore, OVR also announced that Polygon network payments have been added to the Ethereum and BSC network payments currently available to users in the primary market. This will greatly decrease transaction costs while providing a higher scalability potential for the metaverse project. But Why Polygon? Ethereum may be the leading smart contracts platform in the crypto space but there is no doubt that it is an overcrowded and oversaturated network. This high demand on the network, coupled with the network&apos;s inability to scale properly to accommodate its growth, has led to recurring scalability and fee issues, which happen to be some of the highest in space. In light of these problems, OVR, a project initially built on the Ethereum network, has had to move operations to the Polygon network which can accommodate its growth and provide low transaction/minting costs for its users.

The decision is now expected to come by March 31, two months later than originally planned, the report said.  The delay will help NYSDEC complete its review with public comments, Bloomberg said, citing a spokesperson.  The miner applied last year to renew its permits for the plant, the first time it has come up for renewal since the plant has been powering bitcoin mining operations.  On Jan. 16, Greenidge said that due to high electricity demand resulting from recent cold weather, the company temporarily curtailed its cryptocurrency mining operations in Dresden on Jan. 15 to supply all its electrical generation capacity to the New York Independent System Operator.  On Dec. 2, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) questioned the environmental footprint of Greenidge Generation’s (GREE) bitcoin mining operation in New York in a detailed letter. The senator later targeted six more crypto miners, questioning their energy usage.
