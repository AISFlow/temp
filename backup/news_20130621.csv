42422957,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yv5h,1371842479,Does Google Wallet's slow adoption bode badly for bitcoin?,"In May, Google announced to its merchant partners that it would be retiring Checkout. Google Checkout was designed as a platform for online payments, but as a competitor to PayPal it wasn’t getting enough traction. The company’s plan is to merge Checkout into Google Wallet. The idea always has been for Wallet to be - via Android - a replacement, well, for your physical wallet.  The problem is that Google is having issues getting people to actually use Wallet. BusinessWeek recently ran a story about the fact that Wallet is losing money for the company. According to the article, the fees levied by credit card companies on Wallet transactions are costing Google a lot of money. And Google isn’t passing those transaction costs on to Wallet users. That means they ultimately end up eating those fees.  Gartner has noted that the amount of mobile payments will approach 450 million users with a transaction value of more than $721 billion by 2017. No doubt, that’s a huge growing market. Jupiter Research breaks down the payment market by area, with North America and the Asian region around China taking the top spots. Given this data, Google Wallet seems like something that the company would think is worth saving.  Yet Wallet’s use of near-field communications (NFC) may be one of the reasons why it isn’t gaining traction. While on paper NFC seems like an intuitive contactless payment method, only a small amount of transactions are conducted using it. In fact, Gartner projects that only 5 percent of mobile payments will be done with NFC by 2017, up from 2 percent in 2013.  According to the Google Wallet official FAQ, “you can buy in stores by tapping your NFC-enabled Android phone at any merchant location accepting contactless payments.” That web page also goes on to say that there are 200,000 locations where contactless payments are accepted.  So why don’t people actually use NFC for mobile payments? Yes, the iPhone currently does not have NFC at all. But Android has a large share of the mobile phone market. It’s possible that people are concerned about security around near field communications. Or, perhaps the process of setting up Google Wallet is too cumbersome, at least in people’s minds.  This is concerning, given that in order for digital currencies to thrive as a payments system that things like mobile bitcoin wallets will have to become ubiquitous. If bitcoin isn’t easy to use, people will not adopt it.  Think about the first time you used PayPal. Remember that? Send some money to an email address. Not complicated. Bitcoin? Exchanges. Wallets. Addresses that to most people look pretty byzantine. That, all put together, is just too much for most to handle. Payments are supposed to be easy.  PayPal may be an avenue to bitcoin spilling into the mainstream if it can be made just as easy to use. President David Marcus recently told Fortune he thought Bitcoin was ""very well designed.” Yet at the same time, Marcus felt that bitcoin exhibits values that might be closer resembling a precious metal. “People think it's a potential alternative to dollars, but it's more an alternative to gold.”  Google Ventures recently made an investment in OpenCoin’s Ripple, a payment protocol that allows users to send and receive money in whatever denomination they choose – which includes bitcoin. Surely Google has ideas about using Ripple with Wallet. If people aren’t going to use NFC to make payments, maybe using Ripple addresses will work. They operate just like bitcoin addresses in that you can use QR codes to make payments.  But Ripple is far off in terms of any sort of user adoption. It also had experienced heavy criticism early on, which is a major concern for such a new venture. Google’s involvement with OpenCoin is a sign that the company is in need of some new ideas to make Wallet work for payments.  Wireless carriers have an interest in mobile payment methods. One of the reasons why Wallet isn’t more popular comes from the fact that in the United States a few of the major carriers are actually blocking it. For example, while you can use the Google Wallet app on a Verizon phone, a particular hardware element is blocking NFC use by the carrier, restricting the use of contactless payments.  Why? Well, a consortium of carriers in the US have developed their own contactless payment system. Known as Isis, this platform is supported by Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T. And according to Blue Field Strategies, those companies represent a 76% share of the mobile market. This gives them tremendous influence over what payment system consumers will be using with their cell phones because of this control.  When it comes Google Wallet or PayPal, these digital payment processors have one thing in common: they don’t currently utilize bitcoin. For bitcoin to become a mainstream form of payment, they will likely need to be adopted by one or more of these services.  But the struggles of Google Wallet put into question how easy that is going to be. If wireless carriers are going to block Wallet from behaving as an actual wireless wallet, how will they feel about bitcoin? The reason why carriers like Verizon in the United States are blocking NFC on Google Wallet is because they want a piece of the action. They want to make money from the fees that are going to result from the expected growth in mobile payments.  So one has to question whether Google Wallet’s problems are good or bad for Bitcoin. It seems like they might be detrimental. As it stands today, large companies have little incentive to include bitcoin as a payment method. There’s no transaction fees to be had, there is not enough software built around it to secure payments and unlike credit cards there is no fraud protection.  Ultimately, more people need to be using bitcoin and more businesses need to be accepting it. But even if that happens, that does not ensure success. Looking at Google Wallet, you can see what bitcoin is up against. Wallet is available on over half the smartphones in the United States. Over 200,000 merchants accept in-store payment for Wallet. You can also use it to pay for things online. And despite all this, Google is having problems in making it a payment option for people.  What do you think? Does bitcoin face insurmountable odds in becoming a conventional payment method? What should Google do with its Wallet payment service?

42424983,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXJRh,1371826778,Bitcoin vs the 'Bin Laden',"Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 21st June 2013 — a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.    Bitcoin doesn’t wash whiter  There are some unexpected problems in becoming a career criminal. Just nabbing the loot is the easy bit: there are piles of the stuff heaped up in easy-to-access concentrations all over the place. The forces of law and order are usually too busy trying to solve existing blags to spend much time second-guessing what an inventive, intelligent thief or fraudster might come up with.  The biggest hassle is disposing of the ill-gotten. As soon as you start to spend it - presumably, your primary goal - or squirrel it away, a whole host of nosy bureaucrats will start to notice. Assuming you want to avoid really immoral options like going into retail banking or running a multinational then you must disguise your assets. Hence money laundering, and hence a certain amount of official and general suspicion towards Bitcoin.  A report on the use of digital currencies for surreptitious fund transfer and disposal, however, suggests that we’re unlikely to see many crypto-crims flocking to our favourite fiscal upstart. Not only do large movements of cash into or out of the currency reveal themselves to anyone keeping an eye on the global blockchain, but there are so many alternatives that work so well - prepaid credit cards, crooked businesses with high cash throughput, bribing a bank - that, really, it’s not on the radar for the big guys.  As for the smaller fry, well, the biggest boost of late has been the 500-euro note. Nicknamed the “Bin Laden”, because everyone knows what they look like but nobody’s ever seen one, you can get ten thousand of them into a briefcase small enough that even Ryanair won’t charge you excess baggage. In comparison, BTC looks as wholesome as fifty pence in a church collection: another worry to be put firmly on the back burner.  If anyone can, Kenya can...  An interesting article at The Genesis Block asks a very good question - could Bitcoin become the national currency of Kenya?    Probably not, at least not in the foreseeable. But if such a thing does happen anywhere, the developing world has a very good chance of being the place, for the big, historical macro-economic reasons that John Law loves so much.      The article has some specious arguments; that bitcoin is in some way less amenable than cash to being used for corruption, and that the Chinese are big investors in African telecommunications. It isn’t; they are; so what? But it also makes some very good points.    The biggest and best is that Kenya is a nation saturated with mobile devices. So is everywhere else, but the important realisation is that this is the country’s first wave of information technology. In the developed world, we remain saturated in legacy technologies with legacy companies holding onto old ways of working. Kenya - and so much of the rest of the developing world - has leapfrogged all that; Africa has more 4G than Europe and even cheap mobile phones are stupendously capable, these days - just wait for next year’s models.  And the developing world is poor and dependent on remittance; money coming in from family members working in Europe, America and the richer parts of Asia. So far, that cash flow has been heavily taxed by the existing Western money transfer systems; the immediate benefits of moving to a peer-to-peer currency are substantial. Ditto within a country, where bank accounts and other money transfer systems are relatively expensive and underdeveloped.  For the first time, ordinary people in the developing world have the personal electronic technology and connectivity to create their own industrial revolution that’s far more efficient than the older generation we’re stuck with out here in the mature economies.  It won’t happen tomorrow: bitcoin is too volatile and too expensive - it’s a rich kid’s plaything. But the conditions are coming right for something like it to catch fire, and in economies that are poised to grow hugely and packed with ingenuity, ambition and potential that spark may come at any time.  Here’s hoping.  London vs San Francisco - your round  Talking of rich kid’s playthings: a pub in London’s Dalston hipster ghetto has started to accept payment for food’n’booze in bitcoin. It’s not something for the cost-conscious drinker, as the pub takes eight percent of the transaction cost to cover fees (so much for a farewell to credit card company cuts, at least until its suppliers start taking payment in BTC). Also, you have to go through a bit of a dance with mobile phone wallets, QR codes and perhaps even having to tell the bar staff what to do before you can walk away with your pint.  None of this matters. If you’re counting the pennies, you won’t be drinking in Dalston - but you will be wanting to walk the walk of a 21st century trailblazer. And while the instructions may be a bit daunting, they’re actually a pretty good guide to how to do it for anyone considering repeating the exercise. Just at the moment, proof of concept is worth praising in its own right.  John Law, who may on occasion be seen promoting economic activity in the pubs and bars of London Town, considers the true future of bitcoin - and its alternatives - does not lie in the wobbles and whims of far-off trading houses such as Mt Gox. Instead, it’s in using the stuff in normal life. While that’s hard to justify in terms of pure fiscal probity at the moment, if you’re one of the small yet growing band of young urban media/digital/foodiepreneurs who shuttle between London and San Francisco, it can at least be marginally useful.  Like Dalston.  John Law  is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude. He has returned to write for CoinDesk on the foibles of digital currency.

42424966,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXIvh,1371817315,BitAngels floats Blueseed's boat,"Bitcoin-focused angel investor group BitAngels has made its first seed investment, piling $100,000 into an offshore startup community. The money goes to Blueseed, a project to house startup talent 12 miles off the California coast on a converted cruise ship.  Started by a collection of people from the Seasteading Institute, a think tank researching ocean communities, Blueseed's initial purpose is to circumvent what the founders see as restrictive US immigration laws. The difficulty of getting US visas for immigrant startup talent means that non-US citizens are being kicked out of the country and that potential business opportunities are being missed, they argue.  BitAngels focuses on Bitcoin-related investments, though, so what's the link to Blueseed?  ""The Bitcoin community is clearly the most aligned with Blueseed’s mindset (do-it-yourself currency/DIY jurisdiction),"" said Dan Dascalescu, CIO and CTO for the seafaring company. ""The link between Bitcoin and Blueseed is that they are both practical, radical solutions to problems to governance, achieved in an entrepreneurial way.""  Dascalescu spoke at the Bitcoin 2013 conference, and garnered interest from that community, he said. ""One investor insisted on transferring BTC, and we've opened an account with TradeHill for that purpose."" It also has a bitcoin address on its website for non-accredited US investors, along with investor information for accredited or non-US angels.  ""The problem we ultimately are tackling is competitive startup governance, a trillion-dollar and billion-customer market,"" Dascalescu continued.  This libertarian, floating pre-state approach is part of the Seasteading Institute's mandate. It wants to facilitate ocean-based communities that test new ideas for government. The Institute, started in 2008, received significant funding from Californian venture capitalist Peter Thiel.  Blueseed One, which will be positioned 30 minutes by ferry from Half Moon Bay in Southern California, will accommodate 1000 entrepreneurs, or more than 300 startups in addition to 200 community support staff and 200 crew.  The ship will charge a combination of rent (around $1600 per person per month) and equity for startups. They will travel to the mainland using business or tourist visas, which are easier to obtain than non-immigrant H-1B visas.  There is already a long waiting list for berths on the startup ship. 22.9% of applications came from the US, with India as the next biggest source (10.6%), the ""United Kingdom of Great Britain"" next, (5.7%), and Canada (with 4.5% of applications).  Software companies are by far the biggest interest group seeking places on Blueseed One. Although technically it would be possible to operate businesses outside US law (such as gambling or FDA-regulated ventures), that is not the firm's focus, Dascalescu added. ""We only want to push the envelope in sensible ways, immigration being the main one,"" he said. ""Gambling all controlled substances are risky ventures that we will stay away from.""  The ship will cost around $30 million to launch and operate for the first year. ""The third of that is reserved for an investor in Silicon Valley,"" said Dascalescu. ""Securing further financing, given the bold but unproven nature of the venture, is how will be spending part of the seed money.""  The previous round of funding for the project came from the Floodgate Fund, Correlation Ventures, and Xu Xiaopinghttp://eng.zhenfund.com/page1.aspx?no=600 of ZhenFundhttp://eng.zhenfund.com/, a Beijing-based angel fund.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/21/bitangels-floats-blueseeds-boat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/250a9c9a22f588690a9d6a21febbaa2d41277d89-600x347.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
