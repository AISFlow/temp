42400525,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJuV7,1508191846,Sibos Highlights Swift's Complicated Relationship With Blockchain,"There was a looming presence on day one of this year's Sibos conference.  Hosted by Swift, the messaging platform that today connects the world's banks via a centralized ledger system, the event struggled in the face of an unlikely pressure – a competing conference across town put on by Ripple, a competitor focused on promoting a more decentralized solution.  But while neither CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt, nor any of the Swift executives who joined him on stage addressed the event directly, their comments showcased an awareness of what was at stake. Contrary to comments at last year's Sibos, during which Leibbrandt pontificated about the potential of blockchain, Swift largely focused its time this year on the inadequacies of cryptocurrencies.  Speaking in front of an image of what he claimed was a bitcoin mining farm in Mongolia, Leibbrandt waxed poetic about the cryptocurrency's meteoric and unpredictable rise to its current price, while noting the ""interesting valuations"" observed across the asset class.  As the screen switched to an image of tulip bulbs, the audience erupted in laughter.  ""For a very brief moment in the 17th century these things were worth as much as a house,"" Leibbrandt told the crowd. ""For a very brief moment.""  Just as brief, however, was Swift's mention of its own blockchain work – the only time the Swift CEO directly mentioned it was in reference to how suitable Leibbrandt said their internal payments solution — the Global Payments Innovation initiative (GPI) — was for hosting the company's nostro-vostro blockchain proof-of-concept.  Leibbrandt later offered one final description of Swift's GPI that left some in the audience aghast, adding:  ""It's not a swell, it's a tsunami.""  Member experimentation  Yet if Swift was tight-lipped about the ongoing shift in financial technology, others were more verbose.  Speaking on the same stage as Leibbrandt David McKay, CEO of the Royal Bank of Canada, perhaps best represented the large contingent of Swift members at the event who made more bullish statements. There, he highlighted his bank's work with JPMorgan to build an interbank payments platform using the open-source Quorum blockchain, echoing news revealed earlier in the day.  According to McKay, his bank is now exploring blockchain solutions for personal banking, commercial banking and capital markets business, and prior to his address, representatives of BBVA, BNY Mellon, Payments Canada and the European Central Bank all expressed continued interest in the technology during a panel.  Going forward, several events at Sibos are aimed directly at blockchain, while many others seem to be alluding to its potential impact. As such, it remains to be seen if day two will offer a reprieve from the tensions. If McKay's comments are any indication, however, they may not.  McKay said:  ""The opportunity to decentralize record-keeping and remove third parties could significantly remove friction, lower costs, and increase the cadence at which we operate.""

42400535,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJucz,1508186750,An Australian University Is Giving Out Ether to Students,"A public university in Australia is embarking on a new consumer loyalty research effort that will see students earning the cryptocurrency ether as they make purchases at on-campus retailers.  The tie-up involves the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and startup LoyaltyX. Confirmed by the university's media office when reached, the Unify Rewards program focuses on the use of a mobile app that can be scanned and used at stores based at the school's location near Sydney.  The program was officially launched on Oct. 6, and is limited to 500 participants who signed up beforehand. Scheduled to last through No. 20 (though this date may vary), it allows participants to earn $5 worth of ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – for every ten transactions they make through the app.  Several university departments are involved in the initiative, including UNSW's School of Computer Science and Engineering and the School of Business. Though different in scope, it calls to mind an effort at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which saw researchers distribute $500,000 worth of bitcoin to the university's undergraduate population.  Like that undertaking, UNSW and LoyaltyX are hoping to gather data – expected to be published at a later date – about how those taking part in the research study behave once they start receiving ethers.  ""Last month, the value of ether rose by 30%, so we're excited to see how members respond to this type of loyalty currency vs. traditional approaches such as points,"" Andrew Lowe, LoyaltyX's managing director said in a statement, adding:  ""We're confident they'll find it much more engaging, but the research will give us a more definitive answer.""

42400521,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJuRB,1508182244,Bank of America Report: Bitcoin's True Value 'Impossible to Assess',"A potential move by global brokerages to offer products around cryptocurrencies could have a big impact on the wider market, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote.  In an Oct. 16 research note entitled ""Introducing cryptocurrencies – what are they good for?"", the analysts tackle bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and XRP. The note both covers the basics of the market and dives more specifically into the growing galaxy of open blockchain networks in operation today.  Notably, the report touches on the possible factors that could shape the cryptocurrency market's future progression – including financial products based on the tech.  On this point, the bank's analysts suggest that a move by brokerages to begin offering such services to their clients could affect both the overall liquidity of the market as well as the market capitalization for the relevant cryptocurrencies.  ""The coin universe is dynamic and innovative and volatile; while a true value for cryptocurrencies may be impossible to assess, one factor which we believe could affect their liquidity and market capitalisation would be if one or more global broker/dealers decided to offer institutional-like products,"" they wrote.  The past year has seen a number of high-profile efforts to build cryptocurrency-tied investment products, and firms like CBOE have described plans to take part in what is still a nascent ecosystem. Even so, regulators in the U.S. have reacted coolly to such proposals thus far.  And according to the Bank of America analysts, it remains far from certain how the market will develop in the months to come.  ""[A]t present, these impacts are too far off, and too unpredictable, to form part of an estimate or an investment recommendation,"" they wrote.

42400558,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJub1,1508178646,Bernanke at Ripple Event: Blockchain Has 'Obvious' Benefits in Payments,"Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is bullish on blockchain.  Speaking at Ripple's Swell conference in Toronto today, being held the same week and in the same city as Sibos, the annual gathering hosted by Ripple's rival Swift, Bernanke told a room of several hundred attendees that he believes payments can be slow and expensive as designed using existing tools today.  Bernanke, who led the U.S. central bank during the 2008 financial crisis, outlined the complicated process it would take for a bank in Germany to send a payment to a bank in the U.S., before saying:  ""It's an obvious area where new technologies like blockchain or these electronic currencies can be used to improve the process.""  Bernanke, now a distinguished fellow in residence at the Brookings Institute, called out Ripple by name, saying that he's read about the company's work and thinks that any effort in payments to reduce cost, improve accuracy, speed and reliability and ""bring the global economy closer together"" is a good thing.  While the conversation mostly focused on monetary policy, Bernanke was asked to comment more on cryptocurrency and blockchain during the question-and-answer session, and his responses should come as no surprise as he gave bitcoin both muted praise and criticism as far back as 2015.  Echoing those past statements, Bernanke said, ""bitcoin is meant to be an attempt to replace fiat currencies and evade government regulation and government intervention.""  And that attempt, he contends, won't succeed because governments won't allow it. ""When bitcoin becomes a threat they'll take whatever action"" deemed necessary to quash it, he said.  Unlike bitcoin, which works against regulators, he continued, blockchain businesses that collaborate with governments will likely see more momentum in terms of innovating on the payments system. Central banks around the world (including in Singapore, the U.K. and Europe) have taken more of an interest in blockchain technology recently, trying to figure out how it might create efficiencies within their systems.  Case in point: earlier this month, senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Jim Cunha said blockchain and other fintech startups would be pushing incumbent financial institutions and middlemen to be more innovative in their approach.  When asked if bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies and blockchain might affect monetary policy, Bernanke said he doesn't see that happening.  Bernanke said:  ""It could be a lack of imagination, but I don't think monetary policy has changed that much.

For example, while the update appears to have been successful, at least one provider of ethereum software notably struggled with preparations for the rollout. As reported by CoinDesk, UK-based Parity Technologies, used by nearly 25 percent of the network, was beset with bugs through the weekend, a development that spurred speculation about last-minute delays.  But while that specter has been avoided, Parity founder and CTO Gavin Wood is now speaking out on the issues, citing the upgrade process as one that is rife with ""lessons to be learnt"" for the community of developers working on the second-largest blockchain by total value.  In response to requests for comment, Wood outlined his belief that it is perhaps too early to deem the so-called Byzantium code upgrade a successful one, noting the danger zone around a hard fork can extend for several days. Looking ahead, he said he feels that more foresight should be put into whether client software providers are ready to make the shift.  Wood told CoinDesk:  ""There needs to be a more conservative approach to the specification, development, testing and deployment for major protocol alterations like Byzantium... It should be ascertained to as great a degree as possible that all major implementations are in consensus before any determination of a hard fork block.""  Wood went on to use this most recent fork as evidence, describing it as a situation in which most software users were asked to make big upgrades with little time to do so.  As continued bugs were discovered, he said developers ultimately had to make a difficult choice, one of the reasons it remains to be seen just how smooth the rollout will prove.  ""It was really a choice between requiring most users change their software within 48-72 hours to postpone the fork versus possibly or probably requiring a particular subset of the network to update their software at a much shorter notice should a problem be discovered,"" he explained.  Building on this, Wood went on to propose a number of changes he might favor, including scheduling retreats with various software providers or using smart contracts to ""dynamically postpone"" a problematic hard fork.  Still, as these steps weren't taken this time around, he advised caution for those using the network in the days and weeks ahead.  ""I'm generally optimistic that even if further 'zero-day consensus' problems are found by our auditors and tools, we can roll out the antidote upgrades before they become problematic,"" he said.

Announced today  , Mojaloop is aimed at providing an interoperability layer between financial institutions, payment providers and other firms that offer such services to the poor and unbanked. Ripple's Interledger protocol, which is used to transact between different financial networks, is being used to help accomplish that goal.  In addition to Ripple, three other financial technology firms participated in the development of the software. The app came out of the group's Level One Project, an umbrella initiative for its work with the unbanked poor that has seen it explore technologies like blockchain.  The Gates Foundation has been weighing applications of the tech since as early as 2015, including its use as a way to bridge disconnected financial systems.  ""Interoperability of digital payments has been the toughest hurdle for the financial services industry to overcome. With Mojaloop, our technology partners have finally achieved a solution that can apply to any service, and we invite banks and the payments industry to explore and test this tool,” Kosta Peric, the foundation's deputy director of financial Services for the poor, said in a statement.  In addition to the direct work on Mojaloop, the project also saw four other mobile phone technology providers – Ericsson, Huawei, Mahindra Comviva and Telepin – develop a open API to speed up the pace of integrations.

While bitcoin has been on a tear of late, rising from a Sept. 29 low of $2,980 to new highs above $5,800 last week, the bitcoin-US dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate failed to capitalize on this upward movement over the weekend's trading sessions.  At press time, bitcoin is trading at $5,700, up 2.5% over the last 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. Week-on-week, the crypotcurrency is up 19%, while on a monthly basis it is up 52%.  As for the specific reasons for the increase, pundits and observers are still struggling to identify a catalyst for the blast above the psychological hurdle of $5,000. However, one of the more plausible theories is that many are buying bitcoins on hopes that a hard fork in November might end up creating money out of the thin air.  For now, though, it appears as though the bulls are having a breather.  But while possibly deserved, it's worth noting they risk losing control in the short term if prices close today below the previous day's low of $5,455.  Daily chart  The chart shows:  Sunday's price action has produced a ""hanging man"" candlestick pattern  Bitcoin's price suffers a corrective pullback every time the stochastic and the relative strength index (RSI) signal overbought conditions (marked by hand sign and red circles on the chart).  The stochastic oscillator is a chart analysis indicator that helps determine where a trend might be ending, while ""hanging man"" forms at the end of an uptrend and is created when there is notable sell-off (prices dropped to $5,455 yesterday) but bulls are able to push the prices near their opening levels.  In this case, the underlying asset (in this case bitcoin) eventually closes with marginal losses, while the resulting candlestick resembles a hanging man with dangling legs.  The candlestick following the hanging man should close below the low of the hanging man candle ($5,455). It would confirm a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  View  A close below $5,455 today would indicate the rally has found a temporary top at $5,867 (Oct. 13 high). The cryptocurrency could then revisit $5,100-$5,000 levels.  On the other hand, a break above $5,867 (Oct. 13 high) could see prices test $6,000 levels.  Caution is still advised as indicators signal short-term overbought conditions.

Announced today in conjunction with the annual Sibos conference, the pilot was engineered by cloud-based asset trading solutions provider Calypso Technology and enterprise distributed ledger software firm R3. As put forward by participants, the pilot aims to provide an alternative to the slow and costly systems and processes used for FX trade matching today.  In statements, Ramon Martinez Sobrado, global head of CIB Operations at BBVA, lauded the work as a step toward achieving those lofty goals. Still, he also made clear it is in many ways an exploration of how distributed ledgers could be applied in finance.  Sobrado said:  ""Firstly, it gives us the opportunity to assess the impact of a disruptive technology such as DLT, to generate efficiencies in one of our strategic business lines. Secondly, it has the potential to set a new standard in customer experience on the servicing ground.""  Elsewhere, press statements explained how the use of DLT for this use case is believed by the parties to be able to reduce costs while simplifying operations and enhancing efficiency.  Representatives for Calypso, for example, expressed their enthusiasm that the project would move forward with further testing designed to test these assumptions. Already, Mayank Shah, the company's head of strategy, marketing and alliances, said the partners are moving into the next phase.  Speaking also of the wider implications was Todd McDonald, co-Founder at R3, who expressed confidence that the trial, if advanced, could lead to back-office cost savings by replacing ""whole departments"" devoted to reconciliation with a distributed ledger.

42427931,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4gbh,1508157045,Swift Startup Winner Demos Smart Contract Trade with 5 Financial Firms,"Blockchain startup SmartContract is officially unveiling a new a proof-of-concept (PoC) built with assistance from five major financial institutions today at Swift's Sibos conference.  Designed to show how smart contracts could simplify the buying, selling and payment of dividends from bonds, the project makes notable use of interest rate data from Barclays, BNP Paribas, Fidelity, Societe Generale and Santander. The news is also a notable step forward for the smart contract concept, implementations of which have typically lacked the reliable and sophisticated data sources needed to make their innovations a reality.  Still, in conversation with CoinDesk, SmartContract.com CEO Sergey Nazarov positioned the PoC as a way for Swift and other incumbents to prepare for what he believes will be a coming proliferation of smart contract-powered stocks and bonds.  Nazarov said:  ""Everybody keeps talking about how smart contracts are going to be great securities, they're going to be great insurance instruments, and I think they're fantastic for all of that, but for them to be effective, you need to be able to give people the user experience they want.""  And that user experience relies on the integration of widely trusted data into blockchains. For instance, with that kind of data, Nazarov said he was able to streamline the time- and cost-intensive back-office processes normally required in paying out dividends.  The demo can also be seen as the fruition of a whirlwind year for the startup, which won $100,000 at Sibos last year during the conference's startup challenge.  Since then, SmartContract.com – a middleware company designed to connect traditional data sources to a blockchain – has successfully completed a $32 million initial coin offering (ICO) and entered into a partnership with IC3 to use its Town Crier oracle.  How it works  For the PoC, SmartContract's oracle was used to move interest rates from each of the five participating financial institutions into what the startup called its Market Rate Smart Contract.  That contract aggregated the data into a single rate that was then used in a virtual representation of a $1 million smart contact bond. An on-chain payment transaction was then translated into a Swift payment message.  To be able to send that translate the transaction into one Swift could handle, the startup built its platform to comply with Swift's ISO 20022 standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions.  According to Nazarov, that was done specifically to allow Swift members utilizing SmartContract's platform to be able to make payments with the smart contracts as well.  ""If there's going to be usage and volume by their members in this new context, we would want those members to be able to use the Swift network to make payments from the smart contracts,"" said Nazarov, adding:  ""Swift right now doesn't have the capability to connect to various smart contracts on various chains.""  And SmartContract.com wants to be that connection.  The standard glue  SmartContract has plans to use another oracle to pull data from credit ratings agencies like Standard & Poor. In this way, banks connected to the platform could better weigh their investments.  It sounds like a good idea, but even with his successes Nazarov is cautious about the short-term prospects of the company, describing a chicken-and-egg scenario he sees possibly holding the technology back.  While coders are interested in smart contracts, he believes they need more reliable data to continue developing their products. Data providers, too, are waiting for smart contract tools to be demanded before going through the integration process.  Although, as Damien Vanderveken, the head of Swift's R&D department, told CoinDesk, working with the ISO 20022 standard could be the push needed to get one, or both, of those stakeholders to move.  Vanderveken said:  ""It is likely that an end-to-end business process may span across multiple optimization mechanisms … and ISO 20022 is the perfect glue to make sure the end-to-end process works using the same standards across various optimization mechanisms.""

Ether Sees Cautious Boost as Blockchain Upgrade Underway,"Ether prices rose to a six-week high of $350 today as ethereum, the second largest blockchain by total value, appears to have successfully executed a widely anticipated software upgrade.  The first part of a larger technology update called ""Metropolis,"" the ""Byzantium"" code was enacted this morning Eastern Standard Time with minimal contention as anticipated by developers. For now, this means ether's price has put a serious headwind behind it – the next so-called hard fork, a risky software upgrade that opens up the possibility new blockchains will be created, isn't expected until 2018.  In response, the ether-US dollar (ETH/USD) exchange rate surged in value in the run-up to the event.  Prices rose from $298 to $345 on Oct. 13 reportedly due to a high degree of confidence among investors, though the record rally in bitcoin could have pulled ether prices higher as well.  At press time, however, indications are the upgrade is unlikely to be winning new market interest. Despite the smooth implementation, ether prices are struggling to break above $350 levels. The loss of bullish momentum indicates the market may have priced-in the implementation.  Furthermore, ETH bulls might be staying on the sidelines in search of more evidence the software has achieved stability.  Still, the price action analysis favors upside in ether. At press time, ether is trading at $342; up 5.5% in the last 24 hours. Week-on-week, the cryptocurrency is up 13.15%, while month-on-month, it is up 30%.  Daily chart  The chart shows:  Dip demand: Sunday's candle had a long lower body (also known as lower shadow or wick). Prices usually move in the opposite direction after a long wick makes an appearance. No wonder, ether rose to $350 levels today.  Bullish break of the sideways channel.  Bullish 14-day relative strength index.  View  The outlook remains constructive – it may be only a matter of time before ether breaks above $350 and extends the rally to $370-380 levels.  On the downside, only an end of the day close below $320 (previous day's low) would abort the bullish view on the daily chart.

42427927,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4gPh,1508151640,CME Explores Logging Trade Transactions on Blockchain System,"New patent filings from Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) highlight how the firm might use blockchain to store and execute financial transactions.  According to two applications released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on Thursday, the commodity derivative exchange may be looking into developing a transaction platform able to execute transfers automatically at times defined by the parties involved.  The two applications, which primarily differ in the specific language used to describe the potential invention, outline how the platform would be housed on a system of computer processors, utilizing a distributed ledger as the basis for recording transactions.  CME could use this blockchain to catalog every update, using unique cryptographic keys to identify individual transactions and modifications, thus marking every action committed by different parties involved with the data.  The system would be able to let party A know as soon as party B requests a change or modification to a transaction, allowing party B to choose whether or not to validate the change. If both parties validate the change, the ledger would update to reflect the confirmation, but if a party declines the change, the ledger would instead generate a rejection message.  While CME's concept is primarily focused on financial transactions, the system could be applied in other fields, the applications say – including with different regulatory or licensing agencies which issue certifications and licenses, such as passports, visas, and driver's licenses.  The ledger could also potentially be used to verify those credentials by allowing a third-party to check with the issuing entity.

Previous research even went as far to say that these groups were in fact the driving force behind the mainstream adoption of the digital currency in the future, but newer research and figures suggest something different. Vlad Tenev, the co-founder of popular stock trading app Robinhood, has spoken against Bitcoin being the preferred investment opportunity for young adults, and instead expects equities and stocks to instead stay in favour. This is backed up by the fact that stocks are at a record high. But, still despite this, the growth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is far greater, which could back up the previous claims and suggest that the new technology that is cryptocurrency seems to be geared towards the generation that is at the cutting edge of investment. Stocks and Equities: Vlad Tenev is still not convinced and believes that conventional investments will win in the long run. Speaking on the matter, he said; “I wouldn’t say that we’re anticipating a massive shift from stocks to cryptocurrencies. We don’t see the equities market going away anytime soon.” He acknowledges that the growth might well be higher in cryptocurrencies, but there is something underlying that people do not trust about Bitcoin and other coins, which makes people wary. It has struggled to be adopted by retailers, and even as an investment opportunity in the long run. The increased rise could just be because they are newer than more traditional means, and although the talk of investing in digital currencies and the transformative force of Blockchain has grown, people are still turning to more conventional investments and technologies, which are winning in the short-term. Goes against existing research: Tenev’s view is very different to what was expected from 18-35-year olds, which cater for more than 78 percent of RobinHoods customers. The original statements could be based on the fact that there is a distinct distrust in banks, and therefore also of traditional investment models, such as stocks, which is why it was only natural to assume that Millennials would turn to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as investment needs. A survey that was carried out by Bankrate in July, found that 13 percent of younger investors like stocks, while real estate and cash were tied first place among millennial investors at 30 percent each. LendEDU carried out a completely separate poll in August, and found that more than a third of US investors in the US that were aged between 18 and 34, said that they planned to invest in Bitcoins.

42427920,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4gJh,1508148007,Obvious Bubble? SEC Committee Lashes Out at Bitcoin and ICOs,"""Can I suggest something to you? People who come in suggesting that 'everything is different' [while] marketing investment contracts tend to end up looking rather badly.""  Issued by Damon Silvers, director of policy at the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, to Adam Ludwin, the CEO of blockchain startup Chain, the pointed comment set off a tense exchange at a meeting of the SEC's Investor Advisory Committee (IAC) last week.  Special counsel at the largest federation of unions in the U.S., Silvers effectively turned what had been billed as an informational meeting into an explosive dialogue, one in which members of the IAC questioned the legality and legitimacy of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and tokens as investment vehicles.  Created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act as a forum to advise the SEC on regulatory priorities, marketplace integrity and investor protection matters, and comprised of state regulators, academics and large institutional investors, the IAC has more recently taken a focus on cryptocurrencies.  But while Ludwin and others from the cryptocurrency industry sought to educate the committee on the unique qualities and capabilities of blockchain-based assets, Silvers and several other IAC members sounded unconvinced, using the opportunity to air a deep skepticism, and at times, open hostility.  ""As somebody who's been around financial bubbles a [long time], my 'alarmo-meter' is at DEFCON 5,"" said Silvers. ""My sense is that most of the conversation that goes on around this is essentially designed to obscure. [It] uses big ideas and technical jargon to evade fundamental questions that should be asked in this institution about any investment product.""  He continued:  ""I’m deeply, deeply frustrated with a conversation that appears to be designed to evade the law in the context of what appears to be obviously a bubble.""  Unsure arguments  Yet, the assaults, while pointed, were sometimes difficult to parse.  Owing to their apparent early-stage understanding of the technology, those outside the panels tended to lump cryptocurrencies that power public blockchains, like bitcoin and ether, together with tokens – cryptographic assets issued on top of blockchains, often as part of early-stage startup fundraising.  For instance, CalPERS investment director for sustainability Anne Simpson expressed the idea that a core function of the bitcoin network is to reward the computers (rather than the humans) that solve algorithmic puzzles to mine the cryptocurrency.  ""That sounds like Isaac Asimov gone mad,"" she said, in reference to the late science fiction writer.  In addition to Ludwin, other presenters from the blockchain industry included Jeff Bandman, a former fintech advisor to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); Michael Bodson, president and CEO at the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation; Fredrik Voss, vice president of blockchain innovation at Nasdaq; and Nancy Liao of Yale Law School.  The hearing notably comes less than a month after the SEC announced the creation of a new cyber unit to investigate and enforce distributed ledger and ICO violations, as well as an enforcement action against an alleged ICO token scammer.  Tempered concerns  Yet, Silvers and Simpson aside, other attendees had more nuanced appreciations of the technology. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, a more moderate view was put forward by representatives of the government itself.  ""These investments are seen as cutting-edge opportunities for individual investors, but these investments may not be suitable for all investors because they carry such significant risk,” said SEC Commissioner Kara Stein.  Stein continued, putting forth her opinion that blockchain technology has the potential to ""revolutionize"" securities trading and fundraising, but cautioned that clear regulatory oversight was needed to combat growing incidences of fraud.  SEC Chairman Jay Clayton agreed, reiterating previous statements emphasizing the need for investor protections against ICO scams and ""pump-and-dump"" schemes.  These worries, plus the asymmetry of knowledge, will likely continue to have an effect on investor confidence in these new technologies.  For instance, Simpson doesn't think cryptocurrency tokens should be considered an asset class, or that their features align with CalPERS' mission as a manager of pension and health benefits – a strong hint that these funds won't be going into cryptocurrencies anytime soon.  She concluded:  ""Our purpose in the financial system is to serve the people whose savings are being put to work – not to gambling or to speculation or to losses – but to work.""

42427912,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4g3h,1508143540,"Ethereum's Byzantium Hard Fork Is Running Smoothly, Developers Say","While it's still perhaps too early to deem ethereum's Byzantium upgrade a success, developers indicate the software update, executed just hours ago, is running smoothly so far.  Speaking to CoinDesk, unofficial release manager for Byzantium, Hudson Jameson, noted that the new software is now stable, and steadily rolling out across the distributed network, a fact he said can be attributed to ""the hard work (of) developers, users and miners across the ethereum ecosystem.""  But while the impact on ethereum's infrastructure will be substantial, it looks like the network is undergoing an adjustment period. Currently, some blocks are being mined in as little as 1 second, though others are dragging out to nearly a minute – substantially longer than the long-time average of 25 seconds per block.  Further, blocks are filling with relatively high numbers of transactions. That's good news for scalability, as ethereum can, in theory, continue to grow without slowing down the network.  According to the ethereum fork tracker, mining on the old blockchain with the older ruleset has ceased. This is also positive news for ethereum, as it means a relatively low chance that a competing currency will be introduced, as happened last summer when a split produced the rival asset, ethereum classic.  That said, according to ethereum developer Afri Schoedon, there's still a chance that someone is mining the old blockchain, but probably at very high cost.  In the days prior to the fork, developers and node operators (such as mining pools) were given some last-minute toil, as faults found in Byzantium software led to continuous re-releases. The issues saw ethereum developers working around the clock to get the corrected software out on time, and node operators working over the weekend to install the updated software.  At press time, a high proportion of nodes are yet to install the Byzantium update, though the figures are slowly changing and an ongoing trickle of nodes is arriving to the hard fork fashionably late.  Although the price per dollar of ether dropped somewhat in the run-up to the fork, prices peaked close to the monthly high of $350 immediately after, according CoinMarketCap. At press time, ether prices have dropped back to $337 – the same level seen immediately prior to the fork.

42427923,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4gNh,1508133650,Ethereum Executes Byzantium Blockchain Software Upgrade,"Ethereum has officially updated.  At 05.22 UTC, the fifth hard fork to occur on ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, enacted a batch of ethereum improvement protocols (EIPs) designed to enhance the platform. The price per dollar of ether oscillated wildly in the run up, before rising over 2 percent following activation to $348, according to CoinMarketCap data.  First introduced in the ethereum roadmap in 2015 under the name of Metropolis, that large-scale upgrade encountered some substantial delays, leading it to be broken into two phases – Byzantium and Constantinople (the latter still having no formal release date).  As Byzantium was a planned fork with minimally contentious changes, there's been very little disagreement among the community about the merits of the code changes included in the upgrade. However, the fork is still notable in that it's ethereum's first major upgrade since interest in the technology skyrocketed this year, which has been largely correlated to the popularity of ICO tokens launched using ethereum's ERC-20 token standard.  The process was at times a little sticky, though, with ethereum developers encountering some pretty nasty surprises in the run-up to the deadline.  Over the last few days, Byzantium-enabled ethereum software was continuously retracted due to critical bugs found in the code. Developers pushed out corrections just in time – but not without seriously considering postponing the fork.  According to blockchain analytics website Ether Nodes, nodes running faulty software are currently 65.3 percent Gethhttps://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkWatch/geth and 30.4 percent Parityhttps://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkWatch/parity, the two main ethereum clients. As previously detailed by CoinDesk, the faulty software could cause a consensus issue, leading the network to partition, or expose the platform to denial-of-service attacks.  However, so far, there is no sign of a minority fork according to current fork logs, and developers are celebrating the transition on social media.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.

42427916,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4g7h,1508126465,IBM's Stellar Move: Tech Giant Uses Cryptocurrency in Cross-Border Payments,"Big Blue is making what could be considered its first public foray into cryptocurrency.  In the kind of unveiling that can only come before one of the biggest events in global finance, IBM is revealing today at Sibos 2017 the results of a partnership with blockchain startup Stellar in which it successfully settled real transactions using the company's custom cryptocurrency, lumens.  While currently limited to cross-border payments involving British pounds and Fijian dollars, the early-stage platform is nonetheless designed to scale to handle seven fiat currencies in the South Pacific – including the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar and the Tonga pa'anga.  Perhaps the platform's most distinguishing characteristic, however, is that the project showcases how private and public blockchain technologies are increasingly being used in tandem. While IBM's blockchain solutions are designed to complete much of the workflow around transaction clearing, the actual settlement will be conducted using Stellar's blockchain.  In this case, Stellar's lumen serves to digitally connect fiat currencies, allowing for nearly instant exchange without the consumer or buyer ever touching the cryptocurrency itself.  Stellar founder Jed McCaleb told CoinDesk:  ""When trading between multiple currencies, it helps to have a bridge currency to reduce the ledgers needed to maintain. Lumen provides that single ledger that can bridge currencies.""  New orbit  Taken together, however, this partnership goes beyond just technical implications.  Not only is the partnership an outside-the-box move for IBM, which has largely focused on its own blockchain platforms, it's a big win for Stellar, which having emerged from the Ripple founding team hasn't had quite the same growth, perhaps attributing in part to its focus on developing markets.  The partnership is also evidence of the extent of collaboration between blockchain firms and the wider financial world. To make the project work, IBM had help from partners including National Australia Bank, TD Bank and Wizdraw (HK) of WorldCom Finance.  The payments themselves are conducted for the Advancement of Pacific Financial Infrastructure for Inclusion (APFII), an organization of member financial institutions founded by the United Nations and Swift, and operated by KlickEx, a privately-held direct clearing provider that specializes in cross-border digital remittances.  According to IBM's vice president of global blockchain development, Jesse Lund, getting all these players to work together is just an extension of IBM's mission to collaborate with financial institutions to develop a blockchain ecosystem.  To that end, the platform is already integrated with IBM's Financial Transaction Manager, which itself is integrated with ACH, SEPA and other electronic transaction networks. Going forward, APFII's confirmation receipts are expected to be published as MT103 Swift messages directly to the blockchain.  ""This in many ways is just an extension of that, wherein we're providing, in collaboration with banks, and in the process developing this blockchain ecosystem,"" said Lund.  More support  For now, the new project is also a balancing act – at once both a small advancement of early-stage technology and an aspirational advance toward more lofty goals.  While the trial with APFII has been ongoing since last week, the CEO of ClickEx, Robert Bell, said it's too early to provide any numbers about transaction volume. But still, he expects as much as 60 percent of the cross-border retail market in the region to be transacting on the platform once all seven currencies are added (the Australian dollar will be the next currency integrated).  ""For the first time, blockchain is being used in production to facilitate cross-border payments in multiple integrated currency corridors,"" Bell said.  IBM also sees the demo as one with implications for the digitization of central bank money – a concept that's gotten a significant amount of attention recently as central banks around the world grow more interested in figuring out how the technology could create efficiencies.  ""Our long game is to support multiple different types of digital assets,"" said Lund, adding:  ""And I'm very confident that you will be seeing central banks coming forward with their own digital asset issuances that will be a much more formidable construct of this model.""  Today, that future will be discussed in greater detail on stage at Sibos in Toronto, where a panel with representatives from IBM, TD Bank and CLS will discuss the project with the CEOs of both Stellar and KlickEx.  ""It's going to be a wild ride,"" Lund said, concluding:  ""We've got the bankers and the renegades altogether.""
