42397219,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAanz5z,1378830568,Bitcoin benefits from California state amending Money Transmission Act,"The State of California has passed legislation that should make it easier for bitcoin startups to do business in the state. AB 786, passed in the house last week, amends the California Money Transmission Act with some key provisions.  The state's original Money Transmission Act (MTA) classified certain companies doing business in California as money transmitters, imposing stringent requirements on them before they could do business in the state. This legislation is enforced by the Department of Business Oversight (DBO), part of which until July 1 was known as the Department of Financial Institutions. It was the DFI that sent the notorious cease and desist letter to the Bitcoin Foundation in June.  The bill, originally introduced in February by Assembly Member Roger Dickinson, introduces some exemptions from the MTA. Specifically, it stops payroll processors from being included under the MTA, and it revises the minimum net worth requirements required for a licensee to do business, down to between $250,000 and $500,000.  Marco Santori, chair of the Bitcoin Foundation’s regulatory affairs committee, welcomed several positive provisions in the bill. “For some bitcoin businesses, this will make licensing a non-issue in California,” he said.  In particular, a business that enables a company to pay its employees’ salaries in bitcoin might fall under the payroll exemption.  “A business that stands between a purchaser and a seller of goods or services, permitting the purchaser to pay in bitcoins and the seller to receive dollars, might fall under the new goods and services exemption,” he added.  Reducing the minimum capital requirements for a bitcoin startup in the payments or remittance markets is another positive move, Santori said. However, the legislation wasn't all rosy.  “The amendment includes one obvious hot-button issue: it permits the commissioner of the DBO tremendous discretion in raising or lowering the minimum capitalization requirement based on ‘any factor’ the commissioner considers relevant. In the hands of a too-conservative commissioner, or one beholden to established interests, it could become a barrier to entry for a bitcoin business,” Santori warned.  However, one positive aspect of the new law is that the commissioner must inform any applicant for a license of the minimum net worth required for a license, along with the factors used to arrive at that figure. The bill also requires the commissioner to publish all written decisions, opinion letters, and other formal written guidance related to the MTA on his website.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/10/bitcoin-benefits-from-california-state-amending-money-transmission-act,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d287d44447814a23f64fac4b9dda2e3677b1df3c-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397221,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAanz7x,1378817732,"Kraken opens for trading with euros, bitcoins and litecoins","Kraken  is a new exchange for cryptocurrencies. After its long beta test phase, it has just been officially opened for trading.  It is the brainchild of Jesse Powell, the CEO of San Francisco-based company Payward. Kraken has been designed to bring digital currency traders some of the same features enjoyed by forex traders such as stop orders and margin trading.  The graduation from beta status was announced on the bitcoin forum. It was also announced that several features in the original beta version would not be graduated to the live version for another month: margin trading and the ability to trade in US dollars, british pounds, ripples, namecoins and ven. Currently, it is only possible to trade between euros, bitcoins, and litecoins.  There are four levels of authentication – the first three are simple to attain. The fourth is intended for businesses that will be exchanging funds through Kraken.  Powell explained that the company has made progress in gaining regulatory clearance in some geographic areas and gained ""more clarity"" from places in which Kraken cannot operate.  He also told us: ""I'd say the biggest thing we learned from the beta is that people are really excited about the more advanced trading features, rather than caring about compliance. We've also learned that investors put businesses into two pools: launched and un-launched, and that probably matters more than whether you're actually operating legally from a valuation perspective.""  Putting investors aside, Powell said that meeting legal requirements is, however, a core focus for the company:  ""Our aim is to be the first fully compliant bitcoin exchange in the United States. There isn’t one yet. Hopefully we’ll be the first.""  Bitcoin companies based in the US have been under scrutiny in the past few months, with the state of New York subpoenaing 22 companies and the state of California issuing a cease and desist letter to the Bitcoin Foundation.  ""We've seen how much the federal government cares about consumer protection (see NSA) so it'll be interesting to see what develops between the states who are driving bitcoin businesses outside of the US and the federal government who would very much like to keep those businesses here, within their subpoena power,"" Powell commented.  ""So far, the states have shown that being offshore offers protection. Lesson: if you're based in the US, you'll be hassled, if you locate offshore you're free to service US customers without consequence. Not a very positive signal to US businesses and certainly not what federal law enforcement would like to see.""  When asked about the exchange's liquidity and stability, Powell emphasised that Kraken is in communication with the regulators and banks: ""We’re not just trying to slide under the radar and get away with it.  ""They very much know what we’re doing. But it’s always possible that some bank will say, okay, we’ve decided that bitcoin businesses are too much risk and we can’t work with you anymore for whatever reason.""  Kraken has bank accounts in different jurisdictions: one for Europe, one for Asia, and one for the US. Powell points out that although this mitigates some of their risk, Kraken still aims to be legally compliant and work with the banks to avoid any issues.  Powell is one of the founding members of DATA, the self-regulatory organisation created to develop best practices for the transfer of digital assets.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/10/kraken-opens-for-trading-with-euros-bitcoins-and-litecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4fe95b803f4cdb308431c593e5a5480ca7eb257a-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397218,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAanz50,1378808675,Robocoin bitcoin ATMs to be installed in Canada,"Bitcoin ATMs are coming to Canada. A Vancouver-based operator plans to install five of them across the country by early December.  Bitcoiniacs  , a physical exchange for bitcoin that opened at the end of June, purchased the machines for $18,500 each from Las Vegas-based Robocoin. It plans to install the first unit in Vancouver at the start of next month, with four more rolling out in Montréal, Ottawa, Toronto, and Calgary by early December.  Bitcoiniacs started out as a physical bitcoin store, explains founder Mitchell Demeter, who began experimenting with bitcoin exchanges on LocalBitcoins.com.  Demeter, who has also operated digital signage shops, and a local moving company, hopes to install the ATM at a downtown branch of Vancouver-based coffee shop Waves that already accepts bitcoins. That deal hasn’t yet been finalized, however.  “Physical exchanges would be a lot more labour intensive. The beautiful thing is that it lets us scale quickly and brings bitcoin into everyone's reach,” says Demeter.  Demeter hopes to get roughly a 3% commission from the machines, which will exchange bitcoins for dollars, and vice versa. He is using an account on Calgary-based bitcoin exchange Virtex to support the service. Trades are sent via Robocoin’s servers, which checks that there are sufficient dollars or bitcoins in the account to complete the trade, converting from one to the other as necessary.  The company had been planning to use two other exchanges - Bitstamp and Mt. Gox - in addition to Virtex, says Jordan Kelley, CEO of Robocoin. However, things are rapidly changing,  “Mt. Gox is having major liquidity issues, and we will stop supporting Mt. Gox and switch to others,” he said. The firm’s main problem is that there aren’t that many good exchanges out there, he complained. “As better exchanges come online, we will integrate.”  Demeter doesn't anticipate regulatory challenges with his service, asserting that the Canadian financial regulator, FINTRAC, is not yet targeting bitcoin. As an additional measure, he is limiting transactions to under $3,000. Beyond that limit, FINTRAC requires more extensive record keeping for regulated financial transactions.  Kelley says that there are four steps involved in making a transaction with the ATMs, designed to comply with the strictest KYC and AML rules. The ATM, which runs on Windows 7, takes a photograph of the user, and then scans their palm to analyze vein patterns. It then scans their ID, and asks them to sign up with their email address.  ""We gather information and create a real-life profile of the person,"" Kelley says. The operator then verifies their identity manually in accordance with KYC requirements. ""Confirmation will be very quick. It's in the operator's best interests to do this as quickly as possible.""  While KYC confirmations might be quick, block chain confirmations will take the standard time. Users will get a receipt for their transaction, and they’ll redeem it after a single block chain confirmation. Presumably that ten minute average window will give them time to grab a cup of joe.  Robocoin, which announced at the end of August that it was taking preorders, says that it has received over 160 inquiries from countries including Kenya, Zimbabwe, Australia, Sweden, and Argentina. It says it is planning at least another 10-15 shipments in December.  ""Currency and finance were non-disruptable areas previously. They had really high barriers to entry,"" says Kelley. ""Right now we have the ability to shape the future and expand on what it is, and this is a truly democratic currency.""  The $18,500 cost per unit is only good until the end of this month, the company has said. After that, it will rise to $20,000.  Lamassu  , a competitor to Robocoin, began accepting pre-orders for its $5,000 bitcoin ATM in August.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/10/robocoin-bitcoin-atms-to-be-installed-in-canada,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bac6132ff58544992d03acaba583568b05f6400-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
