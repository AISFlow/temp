32912989,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638074,1724801459,Bitcoin Analyst: 4 Crucial Support Levels To Watch If BTC Falls,"Bitcoin is trending lower when writing, cooling off after the encouraging leg up on August 23. Although the uptrend remains, and the coin is not far away from $63,000, there is no discounting the possibility of sellers pressing on. The alignment with the dip of early August could trigger another wave of liquidation, causing panic. Bitcoin Shaky, The First Two Levels To Watch Technically, Bitcoin is within a bullish breakout formation from the bull flag established after the expansion on August 8. Additionally, from a volume analysis perspective, bulls stand a chance since prices are still inside the bull bar of August 23. As long as trading volume remains light as prices trickle lower, buyers may jump back and drive prices higher above $66,000. Related Reading: New ATH Incoming? Expert Says PEPE Poised For ‘Humongous’ Breakout Even so, assuming Bitcoin bears have the upper hand, one analyst on X thinks it will be important for traders to closely monitor how prices will react at the following four reaction lines. From the Bitcoin cost-basis comparison via CryptoQuant, the first support level, now resistance following the ongoing dump, is $63,450. At this price point, the analyst said this is the average price at which new whales buy BTC. It remains to be seen whether prices will recover and print above $64,000 in the coming days. However, the fact that whales are in the picture is a net positive. Typically, whales, unlike retailers, tend to be HODLers and won’t be shaken off whenever prices fluctuate. If bears are unyielding and prices break below $60,000, the analyst continued traders should watch how prices react at $55,540. From the trader’s analysis, Binance users have placed their support at $55,540. Therefore, prices dropping below this level could easily trigger panic selling as traders on this exchange dump scramble for safety. Miners And Long-Term Holders: The Last Walls A level deeper, a key support level will be $44,400. This zone is where most miners are deemed profitable. As long as prices trade above this line, most miners, most of whom are whales, can HODL, expecting price gains. In early August, Bitcoin fell hard but didn’t breach this zone, highlighting its importance regarding BTC price action. Related Reading: Dogecoin: Will History Repeat Itself? What This 3-Year Pattern Means Below this, $25,000 is another accumulation level that traders will watch out for if there is a general collapse. The $25,000 is the average price at which long-term holders (LTHs) bought. LTHs are those who bought BTC over 155 days ago. This cohort mostly comprises whales and network believers. Technically, a break below $50,000 and August 2024 lows might be the basis for another leg down to $40,000 and worse. While bears might take over, there are also supportive factors that continue to spur bulls on. One of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock, recently added BTC to its Strategic Global Bond Fund as a hedge against traditional assets. Its spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, already holds billions of BTC on behalf of its institutional clients.

32910654,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638056,1724796040,Helium: Development Proposals Ignite 15% HNT Price Rally – Details,"Helium (HNT) is continuing its upward trajectory despite the market dip. According to CoinGecko, the token is up nearly 15% since yesterday, sparked by the recent on-chain developments that will expand on Helium’s decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN). Related Reading: Solana’s Popcat Balloons 96% In A Week – The New Token To Watch? Recently, Helium’s official X account announced the voting period for two crucial proposals for Helium Mobile. Aptly named HIP 130 and 131, these two proposals have sparked speculation for HNT’s near-future performance. Helium Proposes New Security Measure Against Malicious Activity HIP 130, titled ‘Data-Only Hotspots’, proposes that the network should expand its reach by using any hotspot that uses passpoint authentication. These devices may come from non-certified Helium Hotspot vendors. These new hotspots will act almost exactly as their Helium-made counterparts, except that they will be used to pass already paid-for data. Users of this new type of hotspot will be rewarded with MOBILE, one of the tokens inside the Helium ecosystem. In addition to this, HIP 131, named ‘Bridging the Gap Between Verification Mappers and Anti-Gaming Measures’, will implement a new system to protect the reward system of the network. The proposal is an “extension” of HIP 125 (Temporary Anti-Gaming Measures for Boosted Hexes) and amends the latter to better protect the network. The new system works by limiting the Oracle Hex boosts in points of interests (PoIs), reducing the rewards multiplier if a hotspot engages in malicious activity. To regain the boost, that hotspot only needs to submit 1 accurate Call Detail Records (CDR). As of writing, both proposals are still under voting with only 11 hours left for the community to engage on. Related Reading: New ATH Incoming? Expert Says PEPE Poised For ‘Humongous’ Breakout HNT To Stabilize Between $6.8 And $7.5 As of writing, the token is trading well between $6.8 and $7.5 with the momentum on the side of the bulls. The current trajectory is eyeing gains well above $8 in the long run. This significant increase in price is accompanied by a proportional increase in HNT’s momentum. However, there might be barriers for the budding rally. HNT’s position, although great in itself, is barred by the dip in the market that further hinders any increase in momentum. Helium can move by itself– only by a short while. How short this timeframe may be is up to speculation as it can dip next week or next month. For now, investors and traders could buy in a small position in HNT while monitoring the broader market sentiment which today, unfortunately, is bearish. Once the situation improves, we will see a rally, breaking through $8 or potentially $10 in the long-term. Until then, caution is the name of the game to protect long-term gains.

The new token called USDS apparently has a piece of code that would allow the issuer to remotely freeze the asset, observers pointed out.  The feature exists in the largest stablecoins of centralized issuers like Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT. They often freeze assets linked to illegal activities at the request of government authorities, like Tether did last week by aiding the U.S. Department of Justice in the seizure of $5 million of USDT for fraud victims.  However, the feature goes against crypto's decentralized ethos that MakerDAO pioneered at its launch and rattled many decentralized finance (DeFi) enthusiasts.  Rune Christensen, the co-founder of MakerDAO, confirmed the existence of the freeze function but explained that it's an option built into the code and won't be switched on when the token goes live next month.  He also added in a separate post that ""upgrading to USDS is optional, and it is only USDS that will have a freeze function.""  ""Dai is an immutable smart contract and cannot be altered,"" he said.  AJ Scolaro, senior analyst at crypto research firm Messari, said that concerns are overblown as the feature was already public knowledge and is necessary for a stablecoin backed in part with U.S. Treasuries to reach widespread adoption.  ""The sudden USDS fud [fear, uncertainty, despair] is funny,"" he said. ""We knew about the freeze function several months ago; it's 100% necessary to safely scale an RWA-backed stablecoin.""  ""A major decentralized stablecoin should both be governed by its users and able to comply with legal systems,"" he added. ""PureDai will be a reasonable alternative offering for skeptics.""

32908366,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637968,1724790644,"Solana, Ethereum Attract Traders Amid Bitcoin Open Interest Plunge","Data shows that Bitcoin (BTC) Open Interest plummeted during the latest market retrace, but Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have been resilient. Solana & Ethereum Open Interest Has Only Seen A Mild Retrace According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, Bitcoin has seen its Open Interest plunge after the pullback in its price. The “Open Interest” here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to a given asset (in USD) currently open on all exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $64,000, But This Pattern Could Mean Bull Run Isn’t Safe When the value of this metric goes up, investors will be opening new positions in the derivatives market right now. As new positions generally suggest a rise of total leverage in the market, the Open Interest registering this trend can lead to more volatility for the cryptocurrency’s price. On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline implies some investors are either closing up their positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform. The asset tends to behave more stably once such a decrease goes through. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Open Interest for three top coins in the sector, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest has dropped around 7.5% in the past day. The reason behind this plunge will likely be the asset’s retrace to levels under $63,000. Interestingly, while Ethereum and Solana have registered similar price drawdowns inside this window, the Open Interest is only down around 2% for both of them. It’s possible that Bitcoin was simply the most leveraged of these assets, so the relatively small price drop was enough to cause significant liquidations. There are also some other possibilities, however. The investors may be more interested in the altcoins right now, choosing to close down BTC-related positions and opening up more positions related to alts like Solana and Ethereum. It’s hard to say whether this increased appetite for speculation around Solana and Ethereum relative to Bitcoin is a positive for the market. Still, it does set these coins up to see some action shortly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tops & Bottoms Occur When This Metric Spikes, Analytics Firm Reveals On the topic of liquidations, data from CoinGlass has revealed the exact figures related to the Open Interest flush the cryptocurrency sector has witnessed in the last 24 hours. The table shows that $107 million in cryptocurrency derivatives contracts have found liquidation during the past day, with over $88 million of these coming from the long contract holders alone.

42390552,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2nPv,1724789064,Pavel Durov: The Imperfect Free Speech Hero,"Over the weekend, Telegram founder Pavel Durov was arrested at a Paris airport and later charged by the Tribunal Judiciaire De Paris with enabling illegal transactions, distributing child abuse material, complicity in the drug trade, and failing to cooperate with law enforcement.  This is clearly a big moment. Here is an enormously powerful social media CEO (Telegram has roughly one billion users) struggling with the very conspicuous long arm of the nation-state. Durov fits a recent pattern of governments re-asserting authority over networks that founders, and many of the rest of us, conceive of as free-speech havens (common spaces) that officials have little right to touch.  Durov’s arrest has generated a lot of conjecture, debate, conspiracy-theorizing and culture war rhetoric in the last 48 hours. Durov’s case is a revealing flashpoint in the free speech wars of the modern internet and the larger question of whether we, as digital citizens, can expect public commons where we can speak freely without interference from what are, in effect, censors.  On one side are the free speech advocates, including X (formerly Twitter) boss Elon Musk, who argue that Durov’s case amounts to a crackdown on open discourse. Musk has started a #FreePavel campaign and brought many millions with him. Interestingly, Mark Zuckerberg chose this exact moment to highlight how the U.S. leaned on Meta during the COVID pandemic to strip ""disinformation,"" seemingly showing solidarity with Durov’s struggles in Paris.  Durov has become a hero in the eyes of those who champion an internet free of mediation, including those in cryptocurrency, even if that freedom leads to people using that network for all kinds of morally problematic and even illegal things. But Telegram, which is the channel of choice for nearly everyone in Web3, is not exactly the encrypted nirvana we might want, ideally. As tech journalist Casey Newton explains:  “Telegram is often described as an 'encrypted' messenger. But as Ben Thompson explains today, Telegram is not end-to-end encrypted, as rivals WhatsApp and Signal are. (Its 'secret chat' feature is end-to-end encrypted, but it is not enabled on chats by default. The vast majority of chats on Telegram are not secret chats.) That means Telegram can look at the contents of private messages, making it vulnerable to law enforcement requests for that data.”  Durov has often presented Telegram as a “secure messenger,” but outside of its secret chat function, the service is more open to government intrusion than Signal, WhatsApp and iMessage. Telegram is not Bitcoin, where transactions are unstoppable. It’s not a blockchain, which accords privacy in a different way from something like Telegram, which, structurally, is both a free speech haven and a honeypot for intermediaries, whether criminal or governmental.  The beauty of blockchains is we don’t have to debate the motivations and machinations of men like Elon Musk, Pavel Durov, and Mark Zuckerberg. The freedom of expression is baked into the code. The free-speech principles at play in Durov’s case should clearly have the crypto community's support. But ideally we would have public online commons that are genuinely free from government intrusion and the whims of single men, however well-meaning.

32906174,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637986,1724785214,Dogecoin Set For A Drop: Bearish Forces Eye $0.0914 Target,"Dogecoin (DOGE) recent attempt to regain upward momentum has been abruptly halted as bearish forces reassert their dominance. After a brief rally, the popular meme coin is now under renewed selling pressure, with the price set to retreat toward the $0.1 mark. As negative momentum strengthens, the question is whether Dogecoin can hold this critical level or if further declines are imminent. This article analyzes the recent shift in Dogecoin’s price dynamics as bearish momentum resurfaces. We will explore the sudden reversal, assess key technical indicators, and evaluate whether the $0.1 support level can withstand the pressure or if Dogecoin is poised for deeper decline. As of the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at approximately $0.1059, reflecting a 3.42% decline. The cryptocurrency boasts a market capitalization exceeding $15 billion, with a trading volume surpassing $535 million. Over the past 24 hours, DOGE’s market capitalization has seen a 3.57% decrease, while trading volume has dipped slightly by 0.83%. Market Sentiment: Bears Tighten Grip On Dogecoin On the 4-hour chart, Dogecoin has displayed strong downbeat momentum following its failure to break above the bearish trendline. The price is now attempting to fall below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). If DOGE successfully breaches this key level, it could begin a more pronounced downtrend, potentially driving the price down to the next crucial support at $0.0914. Additionally, on the 4-hour chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped below the 50% mark, currently resting at 41%. This decline highlights growing bearish momentum and suggests that selling pressure could intensify. On the daily chart, Dogecoin shows significant negative movement below the 100-day SMA by printing two bearish momentum candlesticks. This bearish surge reflects strong selling pressure and negative market sentiment, increasing the likelihood of DOGE reaching the $0.0914 target soon. Finally, the 1-day RSI shows that bleak pressure on DOGE has returned. The signal line’s upward attempt was cut short at 56% before falling below the 50% mark, now resting at 47%, intensifying selling pressure and a growing pessimistic sentiment for the digital asset. $0.0914 In Sight: Will This Key Support Level Hold? Exploring the significance of the $0.0914 support level and its potential to withstand bearish pressure reveals that if the price reaches this level and breaks below, the crypto asset will continue to move downward toward the $0.0745 support. Should the price fall through this level, it may drop to test the $0.0559 support mark and potentially move lower to explore additional support levels. However, if DOGE reaches the $0.0914 support range and bulls stage a comeback, the price could climb toward the $0.1293 resistance level. When it breaks through this resistance, the cryptocurrency may continue to rise, possibly targeting the $0.1491 resistance range and other higher levels.

32904706,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638124,1724781633,Ethereum Community Eyes Mpeppe for Potential Massive Returns,"While Bitcoin (BTC) is currently experiencing a retracement, with its price hovering around the $62,000 mark, Ethereum (ETH) enthusiasts are turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a promising memecoin that is quickly gaining traction. With potential massive returns on the horizon, Mpeppe is becoming the talk of the town among Ethereum (ETH) holders. Bitcoin’s Current Landscape: A Pullback with Potential Before diving into Mpeppe’s potential, it’s essential to understand the broader market context. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has been facing some turbulence. After reaching a daily resistance level of $65,400, BTC has pulled back, now trading near its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around $62,000. This level is crucial, as it could serve as a support from which Bitcoin might stage a rebound. The technical indicators for Bitcoin are showing mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Awesome Oscillator (AO) suggest indecisiveness among investors, yet there is a possibility of a bounce that could see BTC rise back to its previous high of $70,079. Additionally, on-chain data shows a bullish sentiment with a negative exchange netflow, indicating that a significant amount of Bitcoin is being removed from exchanges and stored in holders’ wallets. This reduces selling pressure and could pave the way for a bullish move. However, while Bitcoin continues to navigate through its current challenges, Ethereum (ETH) investors are looking for alternative investments that could offer higher returns. This is where Mpeppe comes into play. Mpeppe: The Rising Star in the Ethereum Community Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as one of the most exciting new memecoins in the market, capturing the attention of Ethereum (ETH) investors who are eager to diversify their portfolios. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to capitalize on the memecoin culture, combining it with innovative tokenomics and a strong community backing. The Ethereum (ETH) community, known for its support of innovative projects, is beginning to see the potential in Mpeppe (MPEPE). The memecoin has already completed over 80% of its Stage 3 presale, attracting a significant number of early investors. These investors are not just looking for short-term gains; they see Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a long-term play that could yield massive returns. Why Mpeppe? Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies in its unique approach to memecoins. While many memecoins rely solely on hype and viral marketing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is building a solid foundation with a strong focus on community engagement and sustainable growth. The project has implemented a series of incentives designed to reward long-term holders, making it an attractive option for Ethereum (ETH) investors looking for a high-reward opportunity. Moreover, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s entry into the market comes at a time when the memecoin space is gaining renewed interest. With established memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) facing challenges, including strong resistance near their 50-day SMA, the door is open for new contenders like Mpeppe (MPEPE) to capture market share. Ethereum (ETH) investors are particularly drawn to Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential to deliver massive returns, similar to the early days of Dogecoin or Shiba Inu (SHIB). The Perfect Timing for Ethereum Investors The timing for Ethereum (ETH) investors to consider Mpeppe (MPEPE) couldn’t be better. As Bitcoin faces resistance and the broader market shows signs of indecision, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh opportunity with a clear path to growth. The memecoin’s ongoing presale, combined with its innovative approach and strong community backing, makes it a compelling investment option. For those in the Ethereum (ETH) community, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a chance to get in early on a project that could potentially skyrocket in value. With its current presale offering tokens at a discounted rate, the opportunity to secure a position in Mpeppe (MPEPE) before it hits major exchanges is now. Conclusion: A New Frontier for Ethereum Investors As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Ethereum (ETH) investors are always on the lookout for the next big thing. While Bitcoin navigates its current challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a strong contender in the memecoin space, offering the potential for massive returns. With its unique approach, strong community support, and timing in the market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming a favorite among Ethereum (ETH) holders. For those looking to diversify and capitalize on the next wave of memecoin mania, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could be the perfect addition to their portfolios.

32904704,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638126,1724781629,Ethereum Investors See a Hidden Gem In New Gambling ICO At $0.001777,"As Ethereum (ETH) continues to establish itself as a dominant force in the blockchain world, with the potential to hit $5,000 according to Vitalik Buterin’s latest projections, Ethereum (ETH) investors are increasingly on the lookout for new opportunities that promise substantial returns. While the ETH community is buzzing with anticipation about Ethereum’s future, a new gambling ICO, Mpeppe (MPEPE), priced at just $0.001777, is quickly catching the eye of savvy investors. Ethereum’s Path to $5,000: What It Means for Investors Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, recently addressed concerns about the network’s decentralization and efficiency. He highlighted significant progress in Ethereum’s roadmap, including improvements in network scalability and security, which bolster ETH’s potential to reach new heights. With over 34 million ETH staked and growing investor confidence, Ethereum (ETH) is well-positioned for a potential surge to $5,000. This bullish outlook has investors not only holding onto their ETH but also seeking out new projects that could offer even higher returns. Enter Mpeppe: A New Gambling ICO with Massive Potential Amid the optimistic forecasts for Ethereum (ETH), Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a hidden gem within the crypto community. This new gambling ICO is designed to tap into the lucrative online gaming market, offering a unique blend of blockchain technology and entertainment. For Ethereum (ETH) investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an enticing opportunity to diversify their portfolios with a project that promises significant returns at a very accessible entry price. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s ICO is currently in its third stage, with tokens available at just $0.001777. With over 80% of the tokens already sold, the demand is clear, and the window of opportunity is narrowing. The project’s roadmap includes plans to integrate advanced gaming features and decentralized finance (DeFi) elements, which could position Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a leader in the blockchain gambling space. Why Ethereum (ETH) Investors Are Taking Notice Synergy with Ethereum’s Vision: Mpeppe (MPEPE) aligns well with Ethereum (ETH)’s ethos of decentralization and innovation. As ETH continues to evolve, projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) that leverage Ethereum (ETH)’s network for decentralized applications (dApps) are gaining traction. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s platform, which promises secure, transparent, and fair gaming experiences, could see widespread adoption as the demand for blockchain-based gambling solutions grows. High ROI Potential: At its current price of $0.001777, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a low-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The gambling industry is notoriously profitable, and by integrating blockchain technology, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to disrupt traditional models and capture a significant market share. For investors who got in early on Ethereum (ETH), Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a similar ground-floor opportunity with the potential for exponential growth. Market Timing: The launch of Mpeppe (MPEPE) comes at a time when the broader cryptocurrency market is poised for a rebound. Despite recent dips, Bitcoin’s (BTC) ongoing resilience and the influx of capital into US spot Bitcoin ETFs indicate a renewed investor appetite for crypto assets. As Bitcoin retests its 200-day EMA support around $62,000, the overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic. This positive environment could amplify Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s growth as investors look for promising new projects. The Road Ahead for Mpeppe With Ethereum (ETH)’s future looking bright and the Mpeppe (MPEPE) ICO gaining momentum, the stage is set for what could be a lucrative opportunity for investors. The combination of Ethereum (ETH)’s strong foundation and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach to online gambling could lead to significant returns for those who get in early. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) moves closer to its next phase, the price of tokens is expected to rise, making now an ideal time for Ethereum (ETH) investors to diversify into this promising new ICO. Whether you’re looking to capitalize on the next big thing in blockchain gaming or simply seeking a high-potential investment to complement your Ethereum (ETH) holdings, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a compelling case. In conclusion, while Ethereum (ETH) continues its journey towards $5,000, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents an exciting new frontier for investors. With its low entry price, strong market potential, and alignment with Ethereum (ETH)’s values, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could very well be the hidden gem that Ethereum (ETH) investors have been searching for.

As Tron (TRX) continues to captivate the market, savvy investors are looking to maximize their gains by exploring new investment opportunities, with Mpeppe (MPEPE) emerging as a promising contender. The Power Behind Tron’s (TRX) Rise Tron’s (TRX) recent ascent is no fluke. Several key factors have contributed to this remarkable growth, positioning Tron (TRX) as a dominant force in the cryptocurrency world. One of the primary reasons for Tron (TRX)’s success is its Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) consensus mechanism, which not only enhances network efficiency but also offers token holders a say in the validation process through elected “Super Representatives.” This democratic and streamlined approach has made Tron (TRX) a favorite among crypto enthusiasts who value both speed and decentralization. Moreover, the positive market outlook for Tron (TRX) continues to build momentum. Analysts predict that, given the right market conditions, Tron (TRX) could soon breach the $0.20 mark. This optimism is further fueled by recent developments in the Tron (TRX) ecosystem, particularly the launch of the Sun.Pump platform, which has revolutionized the creation and trading of memecoins on the Tron (TRX) blockchain. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Next Big Thing for Tron Holders As Tron (TRX) enjoys its time in the spotlight, many investors are diversifying their portfolios with new and exciting opportunities.

With a robust ecosystem and a growing community, Mpeppe is poised to follow in the footsteps of successful tokens that have delivered exponential returns to their early investors. The Perfect Storm: Tron’s Success and Mpeppe’s Potential The combination of Tron’s (TRX) recent success and the emerging potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a unique opportunity for investors. As Tron (TRX)’s price continues to climb, driven by factors like its dPoS mechanism and the Sun.Pump platform, investors are looking for new ways to leverage their gains. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its low entry price and high upside potential, is an attractive option for those looking to multiply their profits. The Sun.Pump platform, which has already facilitated the creation of over 50,000 memecoins, has shown that there is significant demand for innovative tokens on the Tron (TRX) blockchain. Mpeppe is well-positioned to benefit from this trend, offering a fresh and exciting investment opportunity for those who have already profited from Tron (TRX)’s rise. Doubling Down: Why Now Is the Time to Invest in Mpeppe With Tron (TRX) continuing to gain momentum, now is the perfect time for investors to diversify into Mpeppe (MPEPE). The memecoin market is known for its volatility, but it also offers the potential for massive returns. For those who have already seen their investments in Tron (TRX) pay off, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a chance to double down and achieve even greater profits. Investors are always on the lookout for the next big thing, and Mpeppe could be just that.

32904702,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638131,1724781616,Aave Whales Boost Their Mpeppe Holding As They Complete 80% of Presale Stage 3,"As the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to evolve, major players like Aave (AAVE) are making strategic moves to strengthen their positions in the market. One of the latest developments in the growing interest of Aave whales in Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new memecoin that has quickly gained traction. With 80% of its Presale Stage 3 completed, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is positioning itself as a potential breakout star in the crypto world, attracting significant attention from Aave investors. Aave’s Strategic Integration of BUIDL Aave (AAVE) has been a pioneering force in the DeFi space, constantly innovating to maintain its competitive edge. Recently, Aave Labs proposed an integration with BlackRock’s tokenized fund, BUIDL, as part of its GHO Stability Module (GSM). This move is designed to enhance the stability and efficiency of Aave’s native stablecoin, GHO, by leveraging traditional financial assets. The proposal suggests that surplus USD Coin (USDC) collateral will be used to mint BUIDL shares, which will be held in a smart contract until users redeem their GHO for USDC. This integration is expected to improve capital efficiency, increase liquidity, and offer monthly dividend distributions to users. Aave’s strategic vision is to bridge the gap between DeFi and traditional finance, creating a robust ecosystem that benefits from both worlds. Why Aave Whales Are Eyeing Mpeppe As Aave (AAVE) continues to innovate within the DeFi space, its major investors, known as whales, are also looking for new opportunities to maximize their returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a promising candidate, offering high growth potential in the rapidly expanding memecoin market. Mpeppe’s ongoing presale has garnered significant attention, with 80% of Stage 3 already sold out. The low entry price of $0.001777 per MPEPE token has made it an attractive investment for Aave whales, who are looking to diversify their portfolios with assets that offer the potential for exponential returns. The growing interest in Mpeppe is a testament to its potential to deliver substantial gains, particularly as memecoins continue to capture the imagination of the crypto community. The Synergy Between Aave and Mpeppe The growing involvement of Aave (AAVE) investors in Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlights a broader trend in the crypto space: the convergence of DeFi and memecoins. Aave’s focus on stability and efficiency through its GHO stablecoin is complemented by the high-risk, high-reward nature of Mpeppe. This synergy allows Aave investors to balance their portfolios, securing stability through GHO while pursuing significant upside potential with Mpeppe. Moreover, the strategic moves by Aave, such as the proposed integration of BUIDL, reflect a forward-thinking approach to managing risk and optimizing returns. By backing a stablecoin with traditional financial assets, Aave is enhancing the credibility and attractiveness of GHO. Simultaneously, by investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE), Aave whales are positioning themselves to benefit from the explosive growth that memecoins like Mpeppe can deliver. The Future of Mpeppe and Aave’s Role With the completion of 80% of its Presale Stage 3, Mpeppe is on track to become one of the most talked-about memecoins in the crypto space. Aave (AAVE) investors, who are known for their strategic foresight, are clearly betting on Mpeppe’s potential to deliver substantial returns. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain momentum, it could become a key asset in the portfolios of those looking to capitalize on the next big thing in crypto. For Aave (AAVE), the success of Mpeppe (MPEPE) could also signal new opportunities to integrate innovative assets into its ecosystem. The ongoing developments in the DeFi space, coupled with the rise of memecoins, are likely to shape the future of both Aave and Mpeppe, offering exciting possibilities for investors and the broader crypto community. Conclusion As Aave (AAVE) explores new ways to maintain stability and efficiency within its ecosystem, its whales are simultaneously expanding their horizons by investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE). The completion of 80% of Mpeppe’s Presale Stage 3 is a clear indicator of the growing confidence in this memecoin’s potential. With Aave’s strategic moves in the DeFi space and the rising popularity of Mpeppe, both assets are poised for significant growth in the coming months. Investors in both Aave (AAVE) and Mpeppe are well-positioned to benefit from the evolving dynamics of the crypto market, making this an exciting time to be involved in these innovative projects.

With a potential for a staggering 150x return on investment (ROI), Mpeppe (MPEPE) is rapidly becoming the focus of a crypto frenzy that could rival even Dogecoin’s meteoric rise. Dogecoin’s Current Landscape: A Battle of Resistance Dogecoin (DOGE), the beloved memecoin that has captured the hearts of millions, has recently faced a challenging period. Over the past month, DOGE has seen a decline of more than 20%, pushing its price below both its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). These key indicators suggest that Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently grappling with significant selling pressure, which could potentially lead to further downward movement in the short term. On August 23, DOGE made an attempt to break above its 50-day SMA at $0.11 but encountered strong bearish resistance. This resistance forced the price back down, causing it to dip below the 20-day EMA just a few days later. In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, these moving averages often serve as critical resistance levels, and Dogecoin (DOGE)’s recent struggles to overcome them indicate that the coin may be in for a bumpy ride in the near future. However, not all hope is lost for Dogecoin (DOGE). The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator, which measures buying and selling pressure, suggests that the current downtrend could be nearing its end. As the CMF crosses above the zero line, it indicates that selling pressure is waning, making a potential rebound more likely. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) setup for DOGE is also hinting at a possible bullish reversal. If buying momentum continues to build, Dogecoin (DOGE) could break through its current resistance levels, potentially pushing its price up to $0.13. Mpeppe: The Next Big Memecoin Contender While Dogecoin (DOGE) battles its way through resistance, a new player is emerging in the memecoin space: Mpeppe (MPEPE). Known for its quirky appeal and strong community backing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly capturing the attention of Dogecoin (DOGE) investors who are eager to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the next big opportunity. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s appeal lies not just in its meme-centric origins, but also in its impressive growth potential. The coin is currently in the midst of its presale stages, with over 80% of Stage 3 already completed. Early investors are flocking to Mpeppe (MPEPE), driven by the promise of massive returns potentially up to 150x once the coin hits the broader market. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from other memecoins is its innovative approach to community engagement and tokenomics. The project is designed to reward its most dedicated supporters, with a series of incentives and bonuses that encourage long-term holding and participation in the Mpeppe (MPEPE) ecosystem. For Dogecoin (DOGE) investors, who have already experienced the rollercoaster ride of memecoin investing, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh and exciting opportunity to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next major breakout star. The Perfect Storm: Dogecoin and Mpeppe Together As Dogecoin (DOGE) investors look ahead to the next bull run, many are beginning to see Mpeppe (MPEPE) as the perfect complement to their existing holdings. While Dogecoin (DOGE) has already proven itself as a powerful force in the crypto world, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a new frontier with the potential for exponential growth. The timing couldn’t be better. As Dogecoin (DOGE) navigates its current challenges, those who diversify with Mpeppe (MPEPE) could be positioning themselves for significant gains in the coming months. The combination of Dogecoin (DOGE)’s established presence and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rising star status creates a compelling investment strategy that could yield impressive returns as the market heats up. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Memecoin Mania In the world of cryptocurrencies, timing and innovation are everything. As Dogecoin (DOGE) prepares for its next move, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a formidable contender, offering the kind of ROI that has the potential to change lives. For Dogecoin (DOGE) investors, the message is clear: Don’t miss out on the opportunity to ride the next big wave in memecoins. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is here, and it’s ready to make history.

Bitcoin's weekly Bollinger Bands compressed to similar levels seen not just last October, but in other episodes prior to big rallies, crypto trader CryptoCon noted.  Altcoin investors face more pain ahead, but Q4 and next year might promise more upside.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} tumbled below $62,000 during U.S. morning trading Tuesday as the crypto market halted its bounce from early August lows.  The largest crypto fell to as low as $61,500, now down more than 5% since its swift rally to $65,000 following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish speech at Jackson Hole on Friday. It's down 3% through the past 24 hours.  The weak action spread to the wider market, with the broad-based CoinDesk 20 Index down 2.8% during the same period. Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} continued its losing streak against BTC, falling more than 5% below $2,600 and dragging the ETH/BTC ratio to its lowest level in more than three years.  Altcoin majors also suffered losses, with the native cryptocurrencies of Avalanche {{AVAX}}, Chainlink {{LINK}} and Uniswap {{UNI}} leading with 4%-7% declines.  Volatility ahead  Bitcoin's sideways actions since its March all-time highs is testing investor patience, but similar multi-month consolidation phases happened every previous bull cycle, including last year's action between March and October.  Well-followed crypto trader CryptoCon noted that the current low-volatility phase for BTC is likely the precursor of a break-out to the upside to new all-time highs, based on an analysis of the Bollinger Band Width on the weekly timeframe.  Bollinger Bands, named after well-known traditional market technical analyst John Bollinger, represent the volatility of an asset and are placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-week simple moving average of the price.  ""This is the 3rd and final low volatility phase that comes mid-cycle, every cycle on Weekly Bollinger Band Width,"" CryptoCon said in an X post. ""5 months of sideways price action is not new…,"" he added. ""Missing out on 2025 is missing out on 2021, 2017 and 2013.""  Notably, a similar compression of the Bollinger Band Width happened last October, just ahead of bitcoin breaking out of a long consolidation and eventually surging nearly 200% to $73,000 by March.  Altcoin pain  Altcoin holders might face some more pain before lower-cap cryptocurrencies would break out higher and outperform bitcoin, market research firm ByteTree pointed out in a Tuesday report.  ""Altcoin investors need to keep the faith. It’s tough out there, but the underperformance of alts vs. bitcoin has been difficult,"" Charlie Morris, founder of ByteTree, wrote in the report. ""The good news is that positioning is light, and so when the good times return, there is the potential for yet another strong altcoin rally.""  During past market cycles, altcoins followed bitcoin's rally six months after Bitcoin's quadrennial halving, Morris noted.  The last halving took place on April 19, 2024, which would point to a potential rally later this year around October.  ""In each case, alts got a little worse before they got better,"" Morris added. ""If history repeats itself, alts should kick off in the new year, but only once Bitcoin has surged. The good news is that we are on track for a run in Q4.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/27/bitcoin-slides-below-62k-as-consolidation-drags-on-but-traders-eye-possible-parabolic-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7791e26d9df5755ecf71e13e90f08330e99e6158-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The close ties between Toncoin and Telegram have caused a sharp reaction in the market, with TON’s price plummeting over 25% since the event on Saturday. Related Reading: Toncoin Tumbles To $4.6 As Bears Eye Further Decline, Will Support Hold? This sudden drop has left many holders in distress, uncertain about the token’s future. However, while opinions among analysts and investors vary, some see this as a potential opportunity. They argue that TON might be entering a reaccumulation zone, presenting a chance for savvy investors to buy at lower prices before the market stabilizes. As the situation unfolds, the focus remains on whether Toncoin can recover from this setback and regain its previous momentum. Toncoin In Accumulation Zone Toncoin (TON) is currently trading at the same levels it was at the beginning of the month when the broader crypto market was experiencing significant selling pressure. This retracement has caught the attention of several analysts and traders who believe it presents a strategic opportunity to accumulate TON at a discounted price. Coin Signals, a well-known group of crypto analysts on X, has shared a chart analysis indicating that Toncoin is potentially in a reaccumulation phase. According to their analysis, the current price levels could offer a 3x to 5x return if the market conditions align favorably. They argue that the recent price drop, triggered by the arrest of Telegram’s co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov, may have been an overreaction, creating a buy-the-dip scenario for those willing to take on the associated risks. However, it’s important to note that while the potential for substantial gains exists, significant risks are tied to this project, especially in light of recent events. The uncertainty surrounding Telegram and its impact on Toncoin adds an extra layer of complexity for investors. As with any investment, thorough research and risk management are crucial before making decisions. Related Reading: Telegram Faces Indian Probe Following Durov’s Arrest In France: TON Plummets 20% TON Price Action Toncoin (TON) is trading at $5.48 after enduring five days of aggressive selling pressure. In the past 12 hours, the price has recovered about 6%, finding resistance at the $5.04 mark, which has been a key demand level over the past month. This price reaction indicates that bulls are attempting to regain control, but the trend reversal is far from confirmed. For a more definitive shift in momentum, the price needs to break past and hold above the 4-hour exponential moving average (EMA), an indicator that signifies strength in price action. The 4H 200 EMA is currently positioned at $6.41, a significant 18% above the current price. Breaking above this level would be a strong bullish signal.

COIN is overvalued at 11x sales and faces poor seasonality in September, making it unattractive for long-term investors. Long-term investors should buy COIN directly and wait for a confirmed uptrend before considering CONL for short-term trades. I last covered the GraniteShares 2x Long COIN ETF ( CONL ) for Seeking Alpha in April of this year. At that time, the crypto market was near the highs of 2024 as investment demand for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) spot ETFs in the US had taken BTC from $38k per coin in late-January to over $73k per coin by mid-March. The move in Coinbase ( COIN ) stock was even more impressive than that of BTC with COIN rallying more than 140% from early-February to late-March. However, since then most of these assets have gone nowhere. And the scenario that has played out for CONL is essentially exactly why I said investors should aim to avoid: 20 days of back and forth 5% trading sessions in COIN shows how quickly CONL can begin to decay. Even if the GraniteShares 2x COIN fund works as designed and doubles the returns of COIN, it only takes a few weeks before CONL starts underperforming due to market chop. So while the leverage can work very well in a sustained uptrend, the fund will decay over time from daily rebalancing without a strong uptrend. Though not in a straight line, COIN's stock price has declined since that April 19th article. In this CONL update, we'll look at the ETF's recent performance against COIN. We'll also re-examine whether now could be the time to long COIN or CONL after the pullback from highs earlier this year. The Proof Is In The Pudding Data by YCharts In the chart above, I'm showing total return for both CONL and COIN going back to April 19th when my previous article was published. It's clear purely from judging the total return as of August 26th that CONL has performed quite badly. COIN is down a little over 3.3% since April 19th while CONL is down by just under 26%. This isn't a 2x negative return, this is more than an 8x negative return over a four month period. COIN vs CONL, 4/19/24 - 8/26/24 (Seeking Alpha) The other thing to consider is the fact that CONL outperformance to the upside is almost non-existent over this four month period. You can see in the screengrab above that CONL did indeed have close to a 2x return on April 26th when it had a 23.8% return versus 12% for COIN. It still isn't exactly 2x, but it's close enough to make shareholders happy in my personal opinion. But that's as close to positive 2x territory the fund ever got to COIN over the last 4 months. COIN vs CONL, 4/19/24 - 8/26/24 (Seeking Alpha) Even when CONL was briefly outperforming COIN in late-July, at 33.8% to 25.7% the total return for CONL was nowhere close to 2x that of COIN going back April 19th. I think this four month window of chop in COIN shows why CONL is a bad long term investment instrument. Something else that I think helps make the point crystal clear is the year to date performance comps: Data by YCharts Since the beginning of 2024, COIN is up by over 17% while CONL is barely positive. Again, this is due to the daily rebalancing of the 2x leveraged shares. Now it's important to point out that when COIN is in a sustained uptrend, CONL should actually work quite well as a short term trade - we can see that reflected above in the outperformance during March and April. The key is getting the timing on the trade right. So the question today is are we close enough to a bottom in COIN that it might justify a speculative long position in CONL? Is Coinbase A Buy? I'm going to keep this simple; I don't think COIN is a buy today. I was actually asked about this specifically in my recent appearance on Seeking Alpha's Investing Experts podcast . Here's what I said in that mid-August recording: MF : I would love Coinbase if it was priced a bit lower. I think that Coinbase is one of the more interesting stocks in the crypto space. I've been in and out as a trade. I don't currently hold it. But I see this being almost, I don't want to say a 'too big to fail,' because that's not the right phrase. It's a very important part of this ecosystem, especially domestically. So I expect that it will be going forward as well. But I would like it to be cheaper. RS : How much cheaper? MF : Last I looked, it was about 10 times sales. I don't know, we can cut that in half and I'd be more interested. Turns out, COIN stock is actually closer to 11 times sales if we're looking at the metric on a trailing twelve month basis: COIN Valuation Grades (Seeking Alpha) The forward multiple is a little less awful at 9x sales, but either way this is a very expense stock based purely on traditional valuation metrics compared to financial sector medians. Most individual metrics get the 'F' grade from Seeking Alpha and the aggregate valuation grade is clearly 'F.' But beyond the overvaluation, which can admittedly continue for far longer than what more value-oriented investors may expect, Coinbase is also up against bad seasonality as we prepare to enter September 2024: COIN Seasonality (TrendSpider) While it's definitely a small sample size as the company only went public in 2021, COIN has never had a positive return during the month of September in three previous instances. Beyond that, the -7.1% mean change in the month makes September the second worst month of the year for COIN historically speaking. This could be, in part, due to September being a bad month for risk assets broadly over the last few years. Bitcoin has struggled in September recently, as has the S&P 500. But specifically for Coinbase, weakness in digital assets likely isn't good for growth in the company's volume metrics: COIN Volume vs Retail % (The Block) Coinbase did $312 billion in total volume during Q1-24. It was the largest amount of quarterly volume for the company since Q4-21 when BTC's price peaked during the last cycle. Despite surging volume, just 18% of it came from retail traders. Furthermore, at just 8 million in the quarter, transacting users of Coinbase was actually down 4.7% year over year in Q1-24: COIN Transacting Users (The Block) In my view, the company needs another significant leg higher in crypto asset prices from coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) for retail buyer demand to return. Until that happens, I suspect COIN's share price will struggle. By extension, CONL will struggle as well. Closing Thoughts In a little over four months since I last covered CONL for Seeking Alpha, it's evident that the fund is a poor choice for long term holding. In times of strong uptrends for Coinbase stock, CONL will likely perform very well. But even then I can't recommend holding CONL for a longer period of time. Holding should likely be measured in days or at most a couple weeks. COIN stock looks weak to me and I see a poor setup from both seasonal and valuation standpoints. In my view, long term investors who want exposure to Coinbase are better off just buying COIN directly and waiting for confirmation of an uptrend before they consider adding CONL for stronger upside. But again, I don't think we're at that point yet. CONL is still a 'sell.'",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4717407-graniteshares-2x-long-coin-etf-proof-in-pudding?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32903584.jpeg

""Yes"" shares for ""Will Trump debate Kamala on Sept. 10?"" were trading at 84 cents midday Tuesday in New York, indicating the market sees an 84% chance he will go through with it. The bets are written into a smart contract on the Polygon blockchain: Each share pays out $1 (in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that usually trades 1:1 for dollars) if the prediction comes true, and zilch if not.  The contract was published Monday and the odds briefly dipped to as low as 72%, but have mostly traded in the 80s.  To be sure, the amount staked on the question is small – $22,000 – paling in comparison with Polymarket's contract on who will win the election, which has amassed hundreds of millions in bets. The odds there gave Trump a slight lead at the time of writing.  On Sunday, Trump indicated he was wavering on whether to participate in the debate because he believed ABC News, the host, is biased against him.  ""Why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?"" he wrote.  Polymarket bettors mostly doubt the candidates' microphones will be muted during the debate, with a 40% probability. According to The Wall Street Journal, the question of whether to mute mics has been a sticking point in negotiations. ""The Harris campaign has said both microphones should be live, while the Trump campaign has pushed to keep the microphones muted like they were during a June debate on CNN between Trump and President Biden,"" the newspaper reported.  Again, at less than $7,000, there is relatively little money riding on the microphone bet on a platform that saw a record $414 million in volume last month, according to Dune Analytics data.  Another important caveat is that under a settlement with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Polymarket is required to block U.S. users, so those making forecasts on the platform are presumably analyzing data from afar.  On the other hand, the fact that these punters are putting up any money at all carries some weight. They have an incentive to do thorough research or risk taking a financial hit.  On Kalshi, a regulated U.S. platform where trades are settled in dollars, bettors are giving 47% odds that there will be three presidential debates before election day, 42% for two, 11% for one, and a 2% probability of none.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/27/trump-unlikely-to-drop-out-of-abc-debate-with-harris-despite-threats-polymarket-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38eb9d9690d69d229fe86adec13e20fd0984c3b3-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390562,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2oA5,1724775022,Bitcoin Mining Is So Rough a Miner Adopted Michael Saylor's Successful BTC Strategy,"Marathon Digital sold debt to buy bitcoin, after BTC mining profits deteriorated this year.  The miner is following Michael Saylor's footsteps in using borrowed money to add BTC to its balance sheet.  Billionaire Michael Saylor famously pioneered large-scale corporate purchases of bitcoin {{BTC}}, using borrowed money to turn his publicly traded software developer MicroStrategy (MSTR) into one of the world's largest holders of the cryptocurrency.  Now, another company – a surprising one – is following a similar strategy. It's a bitcoin miner, a company that can theoretically snag discounted BTC through mining. The fact that it's following Saylor's playbook, selling debt to fund bitcoin purchases, not using that borrowed money to buy equipment to mine more coins, puts a spotlight on how tough the mining sector has gotten this year.  The miner is Marathon Digital (MARA), which this month sold $300 million of convertible notes, or bonds that can be turned into stock, and purchased 4,144 bitcoin with most of the proceeds.  Rather than purchase more mining rigs, ""given the current mining hash price, the internal rate of return (IRR) indicates that purchasing bitcoin using funds from debt or equity issuances is more beneficial to shareholders until conditions improve,"" the largest publicly traded miner posted recently on X. ""Hash price"" is a measure of mining profitability.  MicroStrategy's bitcoin accumulation strategy was widely criticized when prices crashed in 2022, putting the company's stake underwater. No one is laughing now, given MicroStrategy's bitcoin hoard is worth billions more than the company paid.  Read more: Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy Bitcoin Bet Tops $4B in Profit  MicroStrategy and Marathon's paths in the stock market were largely similar after Saylor began buying bitcoin in 2020. Both were essentially a proxy for bitcoin's price – an attractive quality in the era before bitcoin ETFs were approved early this year.  But this year, there's been a massive divergence. MicroStrategy's stock has soared 90% as it continued to track bitcoin's price. Marathon has plummeted about 40% as the mining business got much harder. The Bitcoin halving in April slashed the reward for mining bitcoin in half, substantially reducing miners' primary source of income.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is a 'Show Me the Money' Moment for Miners  Amid that plunge, Marathon adopted a ""full HODL"" strategy of keeping all the bitcoin it mines – and raising money to buy more.  ""Adopting a full HODL strategy reflects our confidence in the long-term value of bitcoin,"" Fred Thiel, Marathon's chairman and CEO, said in a statement last month. ""We believe bitcoin is the world's best treasury reserve asset and support the idea of sovereign wealth funds holding it. We encourage governments and corporations to all hold bitcoin as a reserve asset.""  Not long after debuting that HODL strategy, it announced the $300 million debt offering. Marathon now owns more than 25,000 bitcoin, second only to MicroStrategy among publicly traded companies.  Profit squeeze  The share price divergence between MicroStrategy and Marathon isn't a surprise, given the woes in mining. The industry is overcrowded, more competitive and facing increased costs. To make matters worse, the Bitcoin network's hashrate and difficulty – two measures of how hard it is to create new bitcoin – are getting higher.  JPMorgan recently said that mining profitability fell to all-time lows as the network hashrate rose in the first two weeks of August, while hashprice (the average reward miners get per unit of computing power they direct toward mining) is still around 30% lower than the levels seen in December 2022 and about 40% below pre-halving levels. Miners are now so stressed that they've been forced to pivot from purely being miners – once a highly profitable strategy – to diversifying into other ventures such as artificial intelligence just to survive. Swan Bitcoin, a miner, even just canceled its initial public offering and shut down some of its mining business due to a lack of revenue in the near term.  ""At current hashprice levels, a meaningful proportion of the network is still profitable, but only marginally,"" Galaxy Research said in a note on July 31. ""Some miners on the fence may continue to operate because they can generate positive gross profits. However, when factoring in operating expenses and additional cash costs, many miners find themselves unprofitable and slowly running out of cash,"" the report added.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Is So Back (Except It's AI Now)  Moreover, the January launch of bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. gave institutional investors that don't want to buy cryptocurrencies, yet still want crypto investment exposure, a more direct route than buying stock in bitcoin miners. After the rollout of ETFs, short selling the miners and going long on ETFs became a prevalent trading strategy among institutional investors, essentially capping the share price appreciation of the miners.  To stay competitive and to survive the squeeze, miners have few choices besides diversifying. Even if a miner with a strong balance sheet like Marathon wants to stay a pure-play mining company, it needs to either invest more capital into an already capital-intensive business or buy competitors. Both options take time and come with significant risk.  In light of that, it's not hard to see why Marathon took a page out of MicroStrategy's successful playbook and bought bitcoin in the open market.  ""During periods of significant price appreciation, we may focus solely on mining. However, with bitcoin trending sideways and costs increasing, which has been the case recently, we expect to opportunistically 'buy the dips,'"" Marathon said.  Nishant Sharma, founder of BlocksBridge Consulting, a research and communications firm dedicated to the mining industry, agrees with Marathon's BTC accumulation strategy. ""With bitcoin mining hashprice at record lows, companies must either diversify into non-crypto revenue streams like [artificial intelligence or high-performance computing] or double down on bitcoin to capture investor excitement around an anticipated crypto bull market, similar to MicroStrategy’s approach,"" he said.  ""For MARA, the largest bitcoin producer, it makes sense to choose the latter: HODLing bitcoins mined at lower costs than the market rate and raising debt to buy more, increasing its BTC stockpile.""  Return of debt financing?  Marathon's bitcoin buying isn't new. The miner bought $150 million worth of bitcoin in 2021. What's new is Marathon used convertible senior notes, a type of debt that can be converted into the company's shares, to raise money to buy more BTC – similar to MicroStrategy's strategy. According to Bernstein, Saylor's company has raised $4 billion to date to buy bitcoin, which helped the company benefit from potential bitcoin upside while having a lower risk of being forced to sell the digital assets on its balance sheet – a strategy that seems to have resonated well with institutional investors.  Additionally, convertible debt tends to cost companies relatively little and avoids immediately diluting the equity stakes of shareholders like a stock offering would. ""With bitcoin prices at an inflection point and anticipated market tailwinds, we see this as an opportune moment to increase our holdings, employing convertible senior notes as a lower-cost capital source that is not immediately dilutive,"" said Marathon.  The miner offered its notes at a 2.125% interest rate, cheaper than current 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of 3.84% and comparable to MicroStrategy's latest raise at 2.25%. The miner was able to offer such a low rate and still attract investors because investors get the steady income from the debts and retain the option to convert the notes into equity, tapping into potential upside of the stock.  ""The advantage of convertible notes over traditional debt financing is that $MARA will be able to acquire a much lower interest rate than they otherwise would due to the fact that the notes may be converted into equity,"" Blockware Intelligence said in a report.  Being able to raise debt at a cheap interest rate also helps Marathon shore up its war chest for potential acquisitions. ""The bitcoin mining industry is in the early phases of consolidation, and the natural acquirers are the companies with large balance sheets,"" said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer or Luxor Tech. ""Adding a Bitcoin balance sheet position allows companies to raise capital with a clear use of funds, while preparing their balance sheet for potential M&A.""  In fact, such debt financing could make a comeback for the entire mining industry, after disappearing from the market during the crypto winter as many miners defaulted on their poorly structured loans. ""Previously, debt financing options available to miners were primarily structured around collateralizing ASICs,"" said Galaxy, adding that lack of liquidity on those loans after the 2022 price collapse hurt the entire sector. Other miners tapping into debt markets recently also include Core Scientific (CORZ) and CleanSpark (CLSK).  ""We believe the industry is in a much better position now to take on some debt and not rely solely on equity issuance for growth,"" Galaxy said.

32901691,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638102,1724774438,Pepecoin Whale Accumenats Millions Of Mpeppe Tokens Before The Price Increase,"As the cryptocurrency market continues its unpredictable journey, one thing remains clear: savvy investors are always on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Recently, a significant movement has been observed among Pepecoin (PEPE) holders, with one particular whale making waves by accumulating millions of Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokens just before an anticipated price increase. This strategic move has piqued the interest of both Pepecoin enthusiasts and broader crypto investors, indicating that Mpeppe might be on the brink of something substantial. The Bullish Momentum Behind Pepecoin (PEPE) Pepecoin (PEPE) has been generating a lot of buzz lately, and for good reason. According to recent analyses, Pepecoin (PEPE) is poised for a potential bull run that could see its value increase by more than 300% in the fourth quarter of 2024. This prediction comes from Captain Faibik, a respected crypto analyst, who highlighted that Pepecoin (PEPE) is currently trading within a symmetrical triangle pattern a technical formation that often precedes significant price movements. Captain Faibik’s analysis isn’t the only one drawing attention to Pepecoin (PEPE). Another well-known trader, Bluntz, has also expressed optimism about PEPE, comparing its current price action to Bitcoin’s behavior in early 2023 when BTC was trading at around $16,000 before skyrocketing to its latest all-time high. Bluntz’s comparison suggests that Pepecoin (PEPE) could be on the verge of a major breakout, similar to the one Bitcoin experienced. Adding to the bullish sentiment, on-chain data from CoinGlass indicates that the open interest (OI) in Pepecoin (PEPE) has surged to $104.45 million in the past ten days. This increase in OI suggests that traders are increasingly betting on a significant price movement for PEPE in the near future. Despite a recent dip, with Pepecoin (PEPE) currently trading at approximately $0,000008568, the overall market sentiment remains positive. The Strategic Shift to Mpeppe (MPEPE) While Pepecoin (PEPE) continues to attract attention with its potential for substantial gains, some of its largest holders, including whales, are turning their focus to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as well. Mpeppe, a memecoin that has been quietly gaining momentum, has just completed over 80% of its Stage 3 presale, raising more than $1.34 million. The token is currently priced at $0.001777, and with the presale nearing its conclusion, many anticipate a significant price surge once Mpeppe is listed on major exchanges. For Pepecoin (PEPE) whales, the move to accumulate Mpeppe tokens is a strategic play. By diversifying their holdings, these investors are positioning themselves to benefit from the potential explosive growth that Mpeppe could experience post-presale. Given the memecoin’s strong presale performance and the viral nature of its marketing campaign, Mpeppe is shaping up to be a serious contender in the memecoin space. The parallels between Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe are hard to ignore. Both tokens have a strong community backing, a history of viral marketing success, and a penchant for explosive price movements. For Pepecoin (PEPE) whales, the opportunity to get in early on Mpeppe before its price potentially skyrockets is too good to pass up. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Could Be the Next Big Thing Mpeppe is not just another memecoin; it represents a new wave of community-driven crypto assets that are designed to capitalize on the viral nature of internet culture. With a low entry price and a strong presale performance, Mpeppe has all the ingredients needed to become a breakout star in the cryptocurrency market. The token’s current stage in its presale journey offers a unique opportunity for investors. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) approaches the final stages of its presale, the anticipation for its market debut is growing. The presale’s success is a strong indicator of the community’s belief in the project, and with more than 80% of Stage 3 already completed, the window of opportunity for early investors is closing fast. Moreover, Mpeppe’s marketing strategy, which includes a 20% bonus for early adopters using the promo code MPEPE20, has further fueled interest in the token. This promotional offer, combined with the token’s viral potential, makes Mpeppe a compelling investment for those looking to maximize their returns in the fast-paced world of memecoins. Conclusion: The Perfect Storm for Explosive Growth The combination of Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) in an investor’s portfolio represents a balanced approach to capitalizing on both stability and high-reward opportunities. Pepecoin (PEPE)’s potential for a 300% increase in the coming months, coupled with Mpeppe’s strong presale performance and upcoming market debut, creates a perfect storm for explosive growth. As more Pepecoin (PEPE) whales accumulate Mpeppe tokens in anticipation of its price surge, the stage is set for Mpeppe to become the next big player in the memecoin arena.

32901688,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638104,1724774437,"PEPE, PEPU And MPEPE The Only 3 Tokens You Need In September","As September approaches, crypto investors are keeping a close eye on the market’s most promising tokens. Among the plethora of options available, three stand out: Pepecoin (PEPE), Pepe Unchained (PEPU), and Mpeppe (MPEPE). These tokens are not just riding the wave of popularity; they are positioned for potentially explosive growth this month. Let’s dive into why these three tokens should be on your radar. Pepecoin (PEPE): A Potential Bull Rally on the Horizon Pepecoin (PEPE) has been a focal point in the crypto community for its volatile yet intriguing price movements. Recently, the PEPE price experienced an 8% plunge, bringing it down to $0.00008583. However, the increased trading volume—up by 27% to $907 million—suggests that traders are actively engaged, possibly in anticipation of a significant price movement. Analysts have identified a Falling Wedge pattern in the PEPE/USD trading pair, a technical formation often indicative of a bullish reversal. This pattern, combined with the support at the 50-day moving average, hints at a potential breakout. Should this occur, Pepecoin (PEPE) could see a price surge of 30-50%, reaching up to $0.00001734. Despite the recent downturn, technical indicators like the RSI and MACD suggest that the bearish momentum might be waning, providing room for PEPE to bounce back. With such potential upside, Pepecoin (PEPE) remains a key player in the memecoin sector. Pepe Unchained (PEPU): The Next Meme Coin to Explode? While Pepecoin (PEPE) garners attention, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is quickly emerging as a formidable contender. This layer-2 memecoin has already made waves by raising nearly $11 million in early funding, a clear indication of strong investor interest. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) differentiates itself by integrating layer-2 technology with Ethereum, which enhances its transaction speed, reduces costs, and improves scalability. These technological advancements, combined with its meme appeal, have positioned $PEPU as a token with 100x potential, according to analysts on 99Bitcoins. Additionally, PEPU offers a double staking mechanism that significantly boosts rewards for investors, with an estimated APY of 185%. Over 865 million $PEPU tokens have already been staked, underscoring the confidence that the community has in this project. Currently, PEPU is priced at $0.0093477 per token, but with the price set to increase in less than two days, the window to buy in at this lower price is closing fast. For those looking to capitalize on the next big memecoin, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is a prime candidate. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Underdog Ready to Shine While Pepecoin (PEPE) and Pepe Unchained (PEPU) are making headlines, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quietly completing its Stage 3 presale, with over 80% of tokens already sold. Priced at just $0.001777, MPEPE offers an entry point that is hard to resist for those looking to diversify their portfolio with a high-potential memecoin. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has gained attention for its viral marketing campaign and the community’s enthusiasm, which has driven its presale success. The project is set to capitalize on the current memecoin craze, and with the presale nearly complete, MPEPE is expected to make a significant splash once it hits the open market. Investors have been drawn to Mpeppe (MPEPE) not just for its low price, but for its potential to follow in the footsteps of other successful memecoins like Pepecoin (PEPE). With a strong community backing and a well-timed market entry, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could very well be the next token to experience exponential growth. Conclusion: The Perfect Trio for September In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, timing is everything. As we move into September, Pepecoin (PEPE), Pepe Unchained (PEPU), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) present a trio of opportunities that could yield substantial returns. Each of these tokens has its unique strengths PEPE with its potential bullish reversal, PEPU with its technological edge and staking rewards, and MPEPE with its viral potential and presale success. For investors looking to make strategic moves in the memecoin market, these three tokens are worth serious consideration. With the right timing and a bit of luck, September could be the month where these tokens not only solidify their positions in the market but also deliver impressive gains to their holders. Don’t miss out on what could be the next big wave in the crypto world.

32901686,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638100,1724774433,Render Holders Dive Right In To Mpeppe As Its Completes Over 80% of Stage 3,"Recently, a new trend has emerged where holders of the Render (RENDER) token are increasingly flocking to a promising new memecoin, Mpeppe (MPEPE), which has just completed over 80% of its Stage 3 presale. This strategic move comes as both tokens demonstrate strong growth potential in their respective niches. The Appeal of Render (RENDER) in the AI Sector Render (RENDER) has been making headlines recently, earning the nickname “Nvidia of the crypto world” due to its unique position in the blockchain and AI sectors. The token provides decentralized GPU rendering services, which are essential for powering various AI projects, particularly in the entertainment and tech industries. With AI technologies like ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming more mainstream, the demand for Render (RENDER)’s services has surged, pushing the token’s value up by approximately 40%, bringing it to $6.45. The excitement around Render (RENDER) has been further fueled by Nvidia’s upcoming quarterly earnings report. Nvidia, a major player in the AI hardware market, has a significant influence on the broader AI and tech sectors. As Nvidia’s stock continues to climb gaining nearly 10% in the last month investors are anticipating positive ripple effects across AI-related cryptocurrencies, including Render (RENDER). This optimism has led to increased attention and investment in RENDER, making it a key asset in any AI-focused crypto portfolio. Why Render Holders Are Turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) While Render (RENDER) provides stability and long-term growth potential in the AI sector, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers something different: the opportunity for explosive short-term gains. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a memecoin that has been rapidly gaining popularity, has just completed over 80% of its Stage 3 presale, raising more than $1.34 million. The token is currently priced at $0.001777, and with the presale nearing its completion, many expect the price to surge once it hits major exchanges. What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) particularly appealing to Render (RENDER) holders is the potential for high returns in a relatively short period. As Render (RENDER) provides the foundational tech for the future of AI, Mpeppe (MPEPE) taps into the viral and community-driven nature of the memecoin market. Memecoins have historically shown the ability to generate massive returns in a short amount of time, and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s strong presale performance suggests it could be the next big thing in this space. The promotional strategy for Mpeppe (MPEPE) has also played a significant role in its success. With the code MPEPE20, early investors can receive a 20% bonus on their token purchases, making the investment even more attractive. This, coupled with the token’s low entry price and strong community backing, has led many Render (RENDER) investors to diversify their portfolios by adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to the mix. The Strategic Combination: RNDR and MPEPE Investing in both Render (RENDER) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a balanced approach to portfolio management. Render (RENDER) provides exposure to the growing AI sector, where demand for decentralized computing and GPU rendering is expected to rise significantly. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the potential for high-risk, high-reward gains typical of memecoins, particularly as it prepares to transition from presale to the open market. This combination allows investors to benefit from the stability and growth potential of RNDR while also taking advantage of the speculative nature of Mpeppe (MPEPE). As the crypto market becomes increasingly segmented, with specialized tokens emerging for different niches, having a diverse portfolio that includes both AI-focused and community-driven assets is a smart strategy. Looking Ahead: What to Expect As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain momentum and approaches the final stages of its presale, the token is likely to see increased interest and investment. For Render (RENDER) holders, adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolio offers a chance to capitalize on the memecoin hype while maintaining a solid foundation in the AI sector. With Render (RENDER) expected to benefit from Nvidia’s positive market performance and Mpeppe (MPEPE) poised to make significant gains once it hits exchanges, the future looks bright for investors in both tokens. By strategically investing in these two assets, investors are positioning themselves for potential 1000x returns as the crypto market continues to evolve. In conclusion, the combination of RNDR and MPEPE represents a powerful investment strategy that leverages the strengths of both the AI and memecoin sectors. As Mpeppe (MPEPE) completes over 80% of its Stage 3 presale, now is the time for savvy investors to consider diving in and securing their share of what could be the next big crypto gem.

32901682,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638010,1724774411,"Is $10,000 Possible For XRP? Crypto Pundit Shares Bold Predictions","Crypto pundit and YouTube influencer Levi Rietveld has projected a bold price target of $10,000 for XRP with his 117,000 followers. His prediction is backed by major developments within Ripple’s adoption and integration into Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Notably, the prediction is influenced by James Wallis, Vice President of CBDCs at Ripple, who has been vocal about Ripple’s ongoing global projects and pilots. In a video that gained significant attention on social media, Levi outlined the potential trajectory for XRP, emphasizing its use in extensive pilot projects and private ledgers across multiple continents—excluding Antarctica. According to Levi, these initiatives could catapult the XRP price to “skyrocket past $10,000 per coin if it all falls into place.” Is $10,000 Per XRP Possible? Levi is referencing interviews with Wallis where he details Ripple’s approach for partnerships with central banks worldwide. He explains that Ripple has been developing private versions of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) tailored to the specific needs of central banks that prioritize privacy and security, leveraging the robust, open-source technology of the public XRPL. Related Reading: XRP Set To Explode? Top Analyst Predicts $33 Rally This strategy allows central banks to utilize a blockchain platform without exposing sensitive transaction data. “The XRP Ledger technology is proven; it has been processing billions of transactions,” Wallis stated, underscoring the reliability and scalability of the technology. Wallis’s unveiled a strategic pivot towards creating a hybrid blockchain system that combines the transparency and efficiency of public blockchains with the privacy controls essential for central bank operations. This bespoke approach has reportedly gained traction, with Ripple working on more than ten active projects across various continents, as Bitcoinist reported. Levi’s enthusiasm for XRP’s potential price explosion is further fueled by recent regulatory developments. He emphasizes significant victories for Ripple against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). “Our recent wins from the SEC prove that well these institutions are going to start being able to use the XRPL how they see fit,” Levi commented. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 42,263% Breakout For XRP Price To $280, Here’s The Roadmap The pundit linked these regulatory advancements directly to potential massive adoption, implying that as legal barriers diminish, financial institutions could integrate XRPL more broadly and deeply into their operational frameworks. This adoption would enhance transaction efficiencies and reduce costs, making XRP more indispensable as a bridging currency in international trade and finance. The anticipation of XRP’s integration into mainstream financial operations has stirred considerable excitement among the XRP army. The potential application across CBDC projects could have a substantial impact on the token’s price. An extensive adoption could significantly increase demand for XRP, driving up its price. Levi’s projection of XRP reaching $10,000 is predicated on the convergence of technological adoption and regulatory acceptance, which could “skyrocket” its value. However, it is important to note that even in the community, the price target of $10,000 is more than controversial. To reach this price, XRP would have to rise by a whopping 1,700,000%. At press time, XRP traded at $0.50.

32901344,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24059,1724772465,Bitfinex Alpha 119 | Nhà đầu tư mạnh dạn rót tiền giúp Bitcoin lội ngược dòng ngoạn mục,"Xem full báo cáo Nhận tin từ Bitfinex Alpha Giá BTC đã có một cú nhảy vọt lên 65.000 đô la vào ngày 23 tháng 8, cùng với sự tăng trưởng mạnh mẽ của các tài sản rủi ro sau những bình luận “úp mở” từ Chủ tịch Cục Dự trữ Liên bang Hoa Kỳ Jerome Powell tại Jackson Hole về khả năng cắt giảm lãi suất . Thông báo này đã khiến đồng đô la Mỹ “chao đảo” và thúc đẩy thị trường chứng khoán, với S&P 500 tiến gần đến đỉnh cao lịch sử. Bitcoin, vốn đang “chậm chân” so với chứng khoán, đã tăng vọt 6,06% chỉ trong một ngày, đánh dấu mức tăng hàng ngày lớn thứ hai kể từ tháng 5. Sự phục hồi này diễn ra trong bối cảnh mối tương quan tích cực ngày càng tăng giữa Bitcoin và chứng khoán Mỹ . Cho đến nay, Bitcoin đã thể hiện sự “yếu thế” tương đối so với chứng khoán kể từ khi chạm đáy vào đầu tháng 8. Sự tăng giá vào thứ Sáu cũng chứng kiến ​​sự gia tăng mạnh mẽ về tương quan, mà chúng tôi tin rằng điều này cho thấy “cơn sốt” rủi ro đã trở lại thị trường. Thêm vào đó là các đợt thanh lý vị thế bán khống “khủng” được thấy vào ngày 23 tháng 8 , với 40 triệu đô la thanh lý hợp đồng tương lai vĩnh viễn BTC và 140 triệu đô la trên tất cả các cặp. Điều này xảy ra khi đã có sự sụt giảm đáng kể về lượng hợp đồng mở, cho thấy đòn bẩy giảm trên thị trường. Khi sự quan tâm đến các giao dịch chênh lệch giá trung lập delta và các giao dịch chênh lệch giá tài trợ tăng lên, lượng hợp đồng mở theo hướng trên thị trường đã giảm, có khả năng “mở đường” cho giá Bitcoin và altcoin tăng. Lãi suất tài trợ hiện tại , thấp hơn đáng kể so với đầu năm nay, cũng cho thấy sự thay đổi trong động lực thị trường, làm nổi bật cách tiếp cận thận trọng hơn giữa các nhà giao dịch sử dụng đòn bẩy mặc dù tâm lý chung là lạc quan. Sự lạc quan của thị trường đã được “tiếp lửa” bởi những diễn biến gần đây trong nền kinh tế Hoa Kỳ, dẫn đến sự thay đổi đáng kể trong kỳ vọng về chính sách tiền tệ, động lực thị trường lao động và hoạt động kinh doanh, nhấn mạnh những thách thức đang phát triển mà Cục Dự trữ Liên bang và các điều kiện kinh tế rộng lớn hơn phải đối mặt. Trong một bài phát biểu rất được mong đợi tại hội nghị chuyên đề của Fed Kansas City ở Jackson Hole, Chủ tịch Cục Dự trữ Liên bang Jerome Powell đã “hé lộ” sự điều chỉnh sắp tới trong chính sách tiền tệ, báo hiệu khả năng cắt giảm lãi suất. Dữ liệu thị trường lao động đã đóng góp đáng kể vào sự thay đổi lập trường này, với dữ liệu cho thấy thị trường lao động Hoa Kỳ đã tạo thêm ít việc làm hơn so với báo cáo ban đầu trong năm qua. Sự điều chỉnh giảm này, kết hợp với dữ liệu bảng lương “kém sắc” hơn dự kiến ​​cho tháng 7 , đã làm dấy lên lo ngại về sức khỏe của thị trường lao động. Tỷ lệ thất nghiệp đạt mức cao sau đại dịch là 4,3%, điều này đã làm dấy lên lo ngại rằng Cục Dự trữ Liên bang có thể đã “chậm chân” trong việc giảm lãi suất. Tuy nhiên, dữ liệu gần đây hơn, bao gồm cả số người thất nghiệp hàng tuần, cho thấy thị trường lao động đang trải qua sự suy thoái có kiểm soát hơn. Trong khi đó, vòng vây tiếp tục thắt chặt đối với các “kẻ xấu” trên thị trường tiền điện tử. Lần đầu tiên, Trung Quốc đã dẫn độ thành công từ Thái Lan một cá nhân tên Zhang, người bị cáo buộc dàn dựng kế hoạch lừa đảo kim tự tháp tiền điện tử trị giá 14 tỷ đô la . Việc dẫn độ ông đánh dấu nghi phạm tội phạm tài chính đầu tiên bị bàn giao theo thỏa thuận Trung Quốc-Thái Lan đạt được vào năm 2019 và làm nổi bật sự hợp tác quốc tế ngày càng tăng để “đánh bại” các tội phạm liên quan đến tiền điện tử. Trên một lưu ý tích cực hơn trong ngành, Franklin Templeton đã đạt được những bước tiến trong việc mở rộng quỹ thị trường tiền tệ trên chuỗi (FOBXX) bằng cách tích hợp nó vào mạng Avalanche. Động thái này cho phép các nhà đầu tư mua cổ phiếu được mã hóa, củng cố hơn nữa vị thế của quỹ trong không gian blockchain. Đã được thiết lập trên Stellar và Polygon, quỹ chủ yếu đầu tư vào chứng khoán chính phủ Hoa Kỳ có rủi ro thấp và nhằm mục đích tận dụng công nghệ của Avalanche để tiếp tục tăng trưởng. Trong một diễn biến quan trọng khác, iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) của BlackRock đã nổi lên như một “ngôi sao” trong không gian ETF Ethereum, trở thành ETF Ethereum đầu tiên vượt qua 1 tỷ đô la dòng tiền ròng . Thành tích này đặc biệt đáng chú ý khi các ETF Ethereum nhìn chung có dòng tiền vào thấp hơn so với các đối tác Bitcoin. Ngược lại, ETHE của Grayscale đã phải đối mặt với dòng tiền chảy ra đáng kể kể từ khi chuyển đổi thành một sản phẩm công khai, nhấn mạnh bối cảnh cạnh tranh “khốc liệt” trong các công cụ đầu tư Ethereum.

32900303,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638065,1724770852,Ethereum Community Embraces Mpeppe as a New Investment Opportunity,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Ethereum (ETH) has long been at the forefront, driving innovation and adoption with its robust smart contract capabilities and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. However, the recent market dynamics have prompted many Ethereum (ETH) enthusiasts to explore new investment opportunities, with Mpeppe (MPEPE) emerging as a standout choice. The Current Landscape for Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has faced significant challenges in recent months. Despite its established position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum has struggled to keep pace with Bitcoin (BTC), particularly in the wake of the recent launch of Ethereum-based spot ETFs. These ETFs, which many hoped would inject new life into the Ethereum market, have instead seen continuous net outflows. Over the past eight consecutive days, nearly $112 million has flowed out of these ETFs, reflecting a broader bearish sentiment that has gripped the Ethereum market. This downturn has been exacerbated by Ethereum’s inability to recover as swiftly as Bitcoin from recent market corrections. While Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, regaining much of its lost ground, Ethereum’s price has remained subdued. As of late August, Ethereum has fallen from a peak of $3,235 to around $2,226, a sharp decline that has left many investors searching for new avenues to generate returns. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Is Gaining Attention Among Ethereum Investors In the face of these challenges, many Ethereum (ETH) investors are turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new and promising ICO that has captured the market’s imagination. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another meme coin; it represents a unique fusion of meme culture with practical utility, particularly in the burgeoning online gambling sector. This innovative approach is resonating with Ethereum investors who are keen to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on emerging trends in the crypto space. Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) appeal lies in its potential for significant returns, particularly given its current low entry price of $0.001777. For investors accustomed to the highs and lows of Ethereum (ETH), Mpeppe offers an enticing opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a project that combines community-driven growth with real-world applications. The Mpeppe team has designed the token to appeal to a broad audience, leveraging the viral nature of meme coins while ensuring that the project has substance and long-term potential. The Strategic Shift: From Ethereum to Mpeppe The shift from Ethereum (ETH) to Mpeppe (MPEPE) among investors is not just about seeking quick gains; it’s a strategic move to tap into the next wave of blockchain innovation. While Ethereum continues to dominate the DeFi landscape, the rise of new platforms and tokens like Mpeppe represents a broader trend in the market. Investors are increasingly looking for projects that offer both immediate opportunities and the potential for sustained growth. Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) success is also a reflection of the changing dynamics within the Ethereum (ETH) community itself. As Ethereum faces ongoing challenges, including scalability issues and competition from newer blockchains, its investors are becoming more open to exploring alternative investments. Mpeppe, with its strong community backing and innovative approach, fits the bill perfectly for those looking to diversify their holdings while remaining within the broader blockchain ecosystem. The Potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Ethereum (ETH) As Ethereum (ETH) navigates its current challenges, the emergence of Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a fresh perspective for investors. While Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the crypto world, Mpeppe represents the next frontier in blockchain innovation. For those who have long been invested in Ethereum, Mpeppe provides an exciting new opportunity to expand their portfolios and potentially achieve significant returns. In conclusion, the Ethereum (ETH) community’s embrace of Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlights a growing trend among investors to seek out new and innovative projects that offer both short-term gains and long-term potential. As the market continues to evolve, Mpeppe is poised to become a major player in the crypto space, offering a unique blend of meme culture and real-world utility that resonates with a broad audience. For Ethereum investors, Mpeppe represents not just an alternative, but a complementary investment that could yield substantial rewards in the coming months and years.

32900301,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638067,1724770841,Ethereum Whales Purchase Mpeppe Before The Price Increases,"The movements of crypto whales those with significant holdings often serve as indicators of market sentiment and upcoming trends. Recently, Ethereum (ETH) whales have been making headlines, not just for their massive sell-offs but also for strategic acquisitions that could signal the next big opportunity. While Ethereum (ETH) supporters remain bullish despite recent market downturns, many of these whales are now turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a promising meme coin poised for a potential rally. Ethereum (ETH) Whales: A Tale of Sell-Offs and Strategic Moves Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable market activity recently, with crypto whales offloading approximately $73 million worth of ETH. These sell-offs have contributed to a 2.39% decrease in Ethereum’s (ETH) price, which currently sits at $2,682.49. Despite the significant selling pressure, the Ethereum (ETH) community remains optimistic, bolstered by the asset’s strong fundamentals and the upcoming Pectra Upgrade. Crypto entities often move large amounts of Ethereum (ETH) to centralized exchanges like Binance and Kraken, usually with the intent to sell. For instance, one whale recently transferred 5,088 ETH worth about $13.66 million to Binance, realizing a substantial loss from previous purchases. Similarly, another whale moved 8,825 ETH to Binance, marking nearly a 23% loss. These transactions highlight the current market volatility and the challenges even seasoned investors face. However, despite these sell-offs, Ethereum (ETH) supporters are staying bullish, focusing on the blockchain’s decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities and upcoming technological upgrades. Influential figures like Ryan Adams have been vocal about Ethereum’s (ETH) potential, emphasizing that “the best is yet to come.” The anticipation surrounding Ethereum’s (ETH) Pectra Upgrade, scheduled for early 2025, also fuels this optimism. This major update is expected to enhance both the execution and consensus layers of the network, further solidifying Ethereum’s (ETH) position as a leading blockchain platform. Why Ethereum (ETH) Whales Are Turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) While Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a cornerstone of the crypto market, some of its biggest holders are now diversifying their portfolios by investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE). Priced at just $0.001777, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a low entry point with the potential for massive returns, making it an attractive option for whales looking to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another meme coin riding the wave of viral internet culture; it represents a unique blend of entertainment and utility, particularly in the online gambling sector. This dual focus has made Mpeppe (MPEPE) stand out in a crowded market, attracting interest from those who have already seen success with established assets like Ethereum (ETH). The growing interest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) among Ethereum (ETH) whales is a strategic move. With the presale already raising over $1.29 million, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining momentum. These whales recognize the potential for Mpeppe (MPEPE) to deliver exponential returns, similar to the early days of Ethereum (ETH) itself. The Strategic Diversification of Ethereum (ETH) Whales The decision by Ethereum (ETH) whales to invest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) reflects a broader trend of strategic diversification. While Ethereum (ETH) remains a stronghold in the crypto market, the search for the next big opportunity has led these savvy investors to explore new horizons. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers the perfect blend of high-risk, high-reward potential, making it an ideal complement to their existing Ethereum (ETH) holdings. As Ethereum (ETH) continues to navigate market challenges and prepares for its Pectra Upgrade, the addition of Mpeppe (MPEPE) to whale portfolios could signal the start of a new wave of meme coin success. For investors looking to maximize their gains, following the moves of Ethereum (ETH) whales into Mpeppe (MPEPE) might just be the next strategic play. Conclusion: A Bold Move for Massive Gains The recent activity of Ethereum (ETH) whales serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of strategic diversification in the cryptocurrency market. While Ethereum (ETH) remains a cornerstone of decentralized finance, the potential for substantial returns from new and innovative projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE) cannot be overlooked. By investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE) before the price increases, these Ethereum (ETH) whales are positioning themselves to benefit from what could be one of the most explosive growth opportunities in the market. For those looking to follow in the footsteps of these savvy investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a compelling opportunity to ride the next wave of crypto success, all while maintaining a strong foundation in Ethereum (ETH).

32900299,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638069,1724770828,Ethereum Investors Flock to Mpeppe Amid Growing Interest in 100x Memecoin,"Ethereum (ETH) remains a pillar of crypto innovation, driving forward concepts like smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, in recent months, even the staunchest Ethereum (ETH) investors have been exploring new horizons, with a significant number flocking to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a 100x memecoin that has captured the attention of the crypto community. Why Ethereum Investors Are Looking Beyond ETH Ethereum (ETH) has long been the darling of the crypto world, often hailed as the future of digital finance. With its groundbreaking smart contracts, Ethereum (ETH) has opened up a world of possibilities, from automating complex transactions to revolutionizing industries that rely heavily on contracts, like real estate and law. The rise of DeFi platforms built on Ethereum (ETH) has further cemented its status as the backbone of the decentralized financial system. However, while Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a leader in the crypto space, it’s not without its challenges. The network’s scalability issues, high transaction fees, and energy consumption concerns have been ongoing hurdles. Despite efforts to address these issues, such as the transition to Ethereum (ETH) 2.0, some investors are looking for opportunities that offer quicker returns and lower barriers to entry. This is where Mpeppe (MPEPE) comes into play. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Frontier for 100x Returns Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly become one of the most talked-about memecoins in the market, offering the kind of explosive growth potential that Ethereum (ETH) investors crave. While Ethereum (ETH) is known for its stability and long-term growth, Mpeppe appeals to those looking for rapid, high-reward opportunities. Unlike Ethereum (ETH), which has already established its place in the crypto ecosystem, Mpeppe is still in its early stages, giving investors a chance to get in on the ground floor. Priced at just $0.001777, Mpeppe offers an attractive entry point for those who missed out on the early days of Ethereum (ETH). The potential for Mpeppe to deliver 100x returns has made it particularly appealing to Ethereum (ETH) investors looking to diversify their portfolios. The Appeal of Memecoins in a Changing Crypto Landscape The growing interest in memecoins like Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlights a shift in investor sentiment. While Ethereum (ETH) continues to be a stronghold for serious, long-term projects, memecoins are capturing the imagination of a new generation of investors. These coins, often driven by community and culture rather than traditional financial metrics, offer a unique combination of entertainment and speculation. Ethereum investors, who are accustomed to the technical and functional aspects of blockchain technology, are now finding value in the cultural and viral potential of memecoins. Mpeppe (MPEPE), with its strong community backing and meme-driven marketing, represents a new frontier where the lines between finance and social media blur. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Is the Perfect Complement to Ethereum For many Ethereum (ETH) investors, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just an alternative investment but a complementary one. While Ethereum (ETH) offers the security and long-term potential of a well-established platform, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides the excitement and opportunity of a new, fast-growing asset. The combination of these two can create a balanced portfolio, blending stability with the potential for explosive growth. Moreover, as Ethereum (ETH) continues to build out its DeFi and NFT ecosystems, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could potentially benefit from the overall growth of the crypto market. As more investors enter the space and seek out the next big opportunity, memecoins like Mpeppe (MPEPE) are well-positioned to attract significant attention and capital. Conclusion: The Future of Investing in Ethereum and Mpeppe The crypto market is vast and ever-changing, and while Ethereum (ETH) remains a cornerstone of the industry, the allure of new opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE) is undeniable. For investors who have already benefited from Ethereum’s growth, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a chance to ride the wave of the next big thing in crypto. With its low entry price and high potential for returns, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is becoming an increasingly popular choice for those looking to diversify and maximize their gains in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. In the end, the synergy between Ethereum and Mpeppe (MPEPE) could offer investors the best of both worlds: the solidity of a proven platform and the explosive potential of a new, rising star.

As AI-focused tokens like Render (RENDER) experience significant gains, a new opportunity is capturing the attention of savvy investors: Mpeppe (MPEPE). Render (RENDER) investors, already enjoying impressive profits, are now turning their gaze toward Mpeppe, betting on the memecoin’s potential to deliver 100x returns. Render’s Ascent Paves the Way for Mpeppe Render (RENDER) has recently surged, driven by the AI boom and the anticipation surrounding Nvidia’s earnings report. The token, which is often referred to as the “Nvidia of crypto,” saw a remarkable 40% increase in its value over the last week. Investors who have been following Render (RENDER)’s journey are well aware of the potential profits that come with early investments in cutting-edge technologies. However, as Render (RENDER) approaches its resistance levels and the market begins to anticipate possible corrections, many investors are strategically diversifying their portfolios. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as the next big opportunity, offering a fresh chance to capitalize on the explosive potential that memecoins are known for. Why Mpeppe Is the Next Big Thing Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another memecoin riding the wave of internet culture. It has quickly garnered attention for its innovative approach to combining humor with real-world utility. Unlike many memecoins that rely solely on social media hype, Mpeppe is building a robust ecosystem designed to deliver long-term value to its holders. For Render (RENDER) investors, who have already seen substantial returns from their AI token investments, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a unique opportunity. The memecoin market is known for its volatility and the potential for massive gains, and Mpeppe is positioning itself as a top contender in this space. Early investors in Mpeppe could see their investments grow exponentially, just as Render (RENDER) investors have witnessed with RNDR. The Allure of Diversification Render (RENDER) has proven to be a lucrative investment, but the volatility of the cryptocurrency market means that diversification is key. By spreading their investments across different assets, investors can mitigate risk and increase their chances of substantial returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a complementary investment to Render (RENDER), allowing investors to tap into the memecoin market’s explosive potential while still holding onto their AI-focused assets. The success of Render (RENDER) has shown that early investment in innovative projects can lead to significant profits. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is following a similar trajectory, with its community growing rapidly and its value increasing as more investors take notice. For those who have profited from Render (RENDER), Mpeppe offers the chance to continue riding the wave of success. The Imapct of Mpeppe and Render As the market watches Nvidia’s earnings report with bated breath, Render (RENDER) is likely to remain in the spotlight. However, as the excitement around AI tokens begins to peak, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a strong contender for the next big crypto success story. The memecoin’s innovative approach and growing community make it an attractive investment, particularly for those looking to diversify their holdings beyond AI-focused tokens. Mpeppe’s rise is a testament to the ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market. Investors who recognize the potential early on stand to benefit the most, and with Mpeppe, the potential for 100x returns is within reach. As Render investors cash in on their profits, many are reinvesting in Mpeppe, positioning themselves for the next wave of growth. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market continues to offer opportunities for those willing to take calculated risks. Render (RENDER) has been a shining example of the profits that can be made from early investments in innovative technologies. Now, as Mpeppe (MPEPE) rises, it offers a fresh opportunity for investors to capitalize on the memecoin market’s explosive potential.

32900295,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638061,1724770818,Ethereum Investors Boost Their Returns With New ETH ICO,"Ethereum (ETH) has long been the bedrock of the decentralized finance (DeFi) world, maintaining a dominant position in the blockchain ecosystem. However, in recent months, Ethereum (ETH) has faced challenges that have left it trailing behind its biggest competitor, Bitcoin. Despite this, savvy investors are finding new ways to maximize their returns, with some turning their attention to emerging opportunities like the Mpeppe (MPEPE) ICO. The Current State of Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has struggled to keep pace with Bitcoin, particularly after the recent launch of spot Ether ETFs, which failed to generate the expected demand. Over the past eight days, these ETFs have experienced net outflows totaling nearly $112 million, marking their longest losing streak since their inception. This contrasts sharply with Bitcoin, which has quickly recovered from the collapse of the Yen-carry trade that rattled global markets earlier this month. While Bitcoin has surged by approximately 8% since early August, Ethereum (ETH) has lagged, still struggling to regain the ground it lost during the market turmoil. The deflationary narrative that once fueled enthusiasm for Ethereum (ETH) seems to have waned, leaving the coin in search of a new driver to sustain its growth. The challenge for Ethereum (ETH) is further compounded by the rise of Layer-2 platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism. These platforms are designed to help Ethereum (ETH) scale more effectively but have inadvertently siphoned off some of the transaction fees that Ethereum relies on to burn tokens and reduce supply. As a result, Ethereum (ETH) is becoming more inflationary, a trend that is causing concern among investors who once viewed it as a deflationary asset. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Is Attracting Ethereum (ETH) Investors In light of these challenges, some Ethereum (ETH) investors are looking for alternative opportunities to boost their returns. One such opportunity is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new ICO that has caught the attention of the crypto community. Priced at just $0.001777, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a low entry point with the potential for significant gains, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another meme coin; it represents a unique intersection of meme culture and utility, particularly in the online gambling space. This combination of entertainment and practicality has positioned Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a strong contender in the market, drawing interest from Ethereum (ETH) investors who are familiar with the explosive potential of early-stage crypto projects. The Strategic Shift from Ethereum (ETH) to Mpeppe (MPEPE) The shift from Ethereum (ETH) to Mpeppe (MPEPE) among investors is not merely a reaction to Ethereum’s recent struggles. It is a calculated move to capitalize on the emerging trends in the crypto market. As Ethereum (ETH) continues to navigate the challenges posed by Layer-2 platforms and an inflationary supply, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a fresh opportunity with the potential for exponential growth. Investors are particularly drawn to Mpeppe (MPEPE) because of its innovative approach to the meme coin space. Unlike many other meme coins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers real utility, particularly in the rapidly growing online gambling industry. This dual focus on meme culture and utility makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) a more sustainable investment option, especially for those who have previously benefited from the rise of Ethereum (ETH). Looking Forward: The Future of Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) As Ethereum (ETH) continues to search for its next growth driver, the crypto market remains in a state of flux. The upcoming Pectra Upgrade, scheduled for early 2025, could provide a much-needed boost to Ethereum (ETH), but until then, the coin is likely to face continued pressure from competing platforms and an inflationary supply. In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining momentum, attracting interest from investors who are looking for the next big opportunity. By getting in early on Mpeppe (MPEPE), Ethereum (ETH) investors are positioning themselves to potentially reap significant rewards, all while maintaining exposure to the broader DeFi ecosystem that Ethereum (ETH) supports. In conclusion, while Ethereum (ETH) remains a cornerstone of the crypto market, the search for higher returns has led many investors to explore new opportunities like Mpeppe (MPEPE). With its low entry price and strong growth potential, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a compelling alternative for those looking to diversify their holdings and maximize their returns in an increasingly complex market landscape.

32899557,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637983,1724769024,Dogecoin Eyes Massive Bull Surge As Metrics Turn Green,"DOGE, the widely recognized king of meme coins, is beginning to exhibit signs of a potential resurgence in its bullish momentum after enduring several weeks of bearish pressure. The cryptocurrency has demonstrated an impressive recovery over the past seven days, with its price surging by a significant 16.3%, reaching a peak of $0.115. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Cross $1 Billion As Bitcoin Crashes To $51,000 This upward movement marks a notable shift in pace for DOGE, which had spent most of the month either falling downward or consolidating. This recent price recovery has renewed bullish momentum and aligns with a resurgence in crucial on-chain metrics. These metrics, which include increased trading volumes, increased outflow from exchanges, a rise in whale transactions, and a rise in buy orders, collectively indicate that the sentiment surrounding DOGE is again turning optimistic. Dogecoin Metrics Turn Green Various Dogecoin on-chain metrics point to DOGE undergoing a bullish rally as we enter a new week. Notably, metrics from IntoTheBlock signal bullish, with two on-chain signals and two exchange signals turning green. Regarding on-chain signals, the “In The Money” metric has increased by 2.52%, while the “Large Transaction” metric has increased by 1.65%, both bullish for DOGE. The first on-chain metric indicates the return of positive sentiment among holders, suggesting that many more holders are now in profit. More often than not, this gives most of them a reason to hold as the price rally unfolds. Regarding exchange signals, the bullish sentiment is relayed through the “Bid-Ask Volume Imbalance.” This metric recently turned green and has reached 28.87%. This imbalance indicates that buy orders significantly outweigh sell orders across various cryptocurrency exchanges, suggesting strong demand for DOGE. When buy orders dominate the market in this manner, it often leads to upward price pressure, as sellers can command higher prices due to the increased buying interest. The bullish momentum can be further relayed through crypto exchange inflow/outflow data. Periods of negative sentiment are characterized by a high inflow rate into exchanges, which increases selling pressure. On the other hand, positive sentiment is characterized by notable outflows from exchanges. Going by this ideology, inflows into exchanges have witnessed a drastic drop of -73.81% in the past 24 hours. Similarly, netflow (inflow minus outflow) has reduced by 120.56 million DOGE tokens in the same time frame, which suggests more withdrawals than deposits into exchanges. Dogecoin Eyes Bull Run With metrics pointing bullish and the wider market receiving inflows, the only place left for DOGE to go is up. As the king of meme coins, a promising DOGE price action is good for all meme cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Data Shows Sellers Have Returned To Bitcoin: Is A Major Price Drop On The Horizon? At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1088. Although it has reversed a bit since hitting $0.1147, it seems to have established support around $0.108. Another move to the upside from this support would undoubtedly trigger confidence among many investors.

32897424,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=638053,1724763654,Crypto Experts Believe Greatness Is On The Way For Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Husky Inu (HINU),"Certain projects stand out for their potential to achieve greatness. Two such projects, Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Husky Inu (HINU), are rapidly gaining recognition among crypto experts. These tokens are not only capturing the interest of investors but are also being hailed as future stars in the digital asset space. Here’s why experts believe that greatness is on the horizon for Mpeppe (MPEPE) and Husky Inu (HINU). Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Revolutionary Approach to Community and Wealth Creation Mpeppe (MPEPE) is far more than just another memecoin; it represents a movement that seeks to redefine the role of cryptocurrency in community building and wealth creation. Drawing inspiration from the success of Pepecoin, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is designed to unite global sports enthusiasts and crypto investors through a platform that fosters creativity, drives positive change, and builds wealth. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Is Poised for Greatness Experts believe that Mpeppe (MPEPE) is on the path to greatness due to its unique approach to integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) into its ecosystem. By facilitating financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming within its platform, Mpeppe (MPEPE) adds real utility and value to the token, far beyond the typical scope of a memecoin. This convergence of meme culture with DeFi functionality makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) a standout project, offering investors both entertainment and tangible financial benefits. The project’s commitment to creating a global community that transcends financial transactions has captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts and positioned Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a key player in the next wave of digital assets. Husky Inu (HINU): A Rising Star on the Solana Blockchain Husky Inu (HINU), a Solana-based memecoin, has quickly made a name for itself in the crypto community. Known as the “new best friend” of Shiba Inu (SHIB), Husky Inu (HINU) leverages the speed and scalability of the Solana blockchain to provide value and utility to its users. Since its launch, Husky Inu (HINU) has garnered significant attention, with its presale stages selling out rapidly and raising substantial funds. The Potential for Husky Inu (HINU) to Achieve Greatness Husky Inu (HINU) is being hailed as a rising star due to its strategic use of the Solana blockchain, which offers faster transaction speeds and lower costs compared to many other networks.

32897422,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637972,1724763650,New ATH Incoming? Expert Says PEPE Poised For ‘Humongous’ Breakout,"Pepe Coin is attracting the attention of analysts and crypto enthusiasts with the meme coin’s recent performance. Over the last week, PEPE surged 8%, amid developments in the market and growth in investor confidence. Related Reading: FET Explodes 60% After New Project Announcement – Details According to crypto price prediction platform CoinCodex, PEPE is going to surge upward by 226%, which takes PEPE price to $0.00002804 by September 26, 2024. These are very bullish forecast helped along by analyses that indicate PEPE could be signaling a “humongous” breakout, according to crypto analyst The Crypto Titan. $PEPE 👋 (daily) #pepe made a nice comeback 📈 after getting bottomed out from the Symmetrical triangle in the daily timeframe🟢. We can get a Humongous 🚀 Breakout, if we get a breakout from this symmetrical triangle❗️. Currently the price moving towards the breakout👀,… pic.twitter.com/lqwcln0lUY — The Crypto Titan’s (@cryptotitans11) August 26, 2024 PEPE: The Symmetrical Triangle The pattern is noted in the manner in which PEPE had rebounded recently from the lower boundary, which validates the healthy buyer support at this level. The price is now nearing the apex of the triangle, which indicates that there is an impending breakout. Generally, the breakout from a triangle’s upper trend line leads to large price increases. According to analysts, the price might likely record a significant gain that will send it to new all-time highs if PEPE manages to break beyond this level. Again, the bullish sentiment is is being confirmed by a couple of technical indicators. For instance, the price of PEPE is close to the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting that the upside remains strong. They have a potential short-term resistance level at $0.00000955; if it were to break, the next target zone would be around $0.00001300. The current volatility stands at 15%, with the coin having experienced 11 out of 30 days “green” in the last month. That’s obviously in favor of rising prices. Although with such high volatility, currently the indicators hint that a breakout above $0.00000955 with very high volume accumulation and similar bullish patterns features a good long-term buying opportunity.

At the present, mood is neutral; the Fear & Greed Index matches this and stands at a reasonable 48, which is an excellent time to acquire PEPE given such a balanced attitude along with a good projected price increase. A crossover of technical analysis with the recent performance is suggesting potential gains for major levels. This is something that investors in meme coins will need to keep a close watch on, as the technical patterns all seem to show that it is a great choice right now. Its forecast firmly points strongly to major future gains, and a breakout could be just around the corner for PEPE.

42390556,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2naB,1724760373,Bitcoin Miners Are in M&A Mode: Architect Partners,"The bitcoin mining sector is in the middle of a wave of M&A, the report said.  Architect Partners said miners want to secure large data center capacity with access to low cost power and capital.  The effect of miner concentration is yet to be seen, the note said.  The bitcoin {{BTC}} mining sector is in the middle of a consolidation phase which was triggered by the recent halving in April, investment bank Architect Partners said in a report on Sunday.  ""The strategic driver is to secure large and scalable data center capacity with access to low cost power and capital, all made easier as a company gets larger,"" managing partner Eric Risley and analyst Arjun Mehra wrote.  Bitfarms' (BITF) planned acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) is evidence of this recent M&A trend.  The deal is noteworthy as Bitfarms was subject to an unsolicited takeover offer from rival miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) in May, and Riot has since bought 19% of Bitfarms' stock in the open market, agitated to replace management, and fought a proxy battle to replace two board members, the report said.  ""Sometimes the best defense is offense,"" the authors wrote, adding that Bitfarms has subsequently announced the acquisition of Stronghold together with management and board changes.  Still, hostile M&A can be tricky, the report cautioned, and such deals are unusual in technology and financial services business which rely on the talent of people. ""However, bitcoin mining is very different where physical facilities with access to electricity and widely available computing equipment are the core assets.""  Architect Partners said the current consolidation phase is ironic as the bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision was that anyone could set up a computer to mine the cryptocurrency, that everyone could run the network, and that no one would control a large amount of the hashrate. Hashrate is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.  The effects of concentration in the mining sector are yet to be seen, but some like Jack Dorsey and the Block (SQ), the company he founded, are attempting to reverse this trend by ""building semiconductors and systems to support a return to mining decentralization,"" the report added.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,004 −3.5% Bitcoin (BTC): $62,471 −2.4% Ether (ETH): $2,632 −4.1% S&P 500: 5,616.84 −0.3% Gold: $2,547 +1.2% Nikkei 225: 38,288.62 +0.47%  Top Stories  Bitcoin slid under $63,000 as traders took profits following the crypto market's weekend rally. BTC has dropped over 2.4% in the last 24 hours to trade just below $62,500, while the broader market has fallen 2.15%. QCP Capital, a Singapore-based trading desk, noted an increase in call spread buying while noting the selling of bitcoin calls at the $100,000 level. The strategy suggests a generally bullish mood, but not an explosive move higher in the short term. ""BTC and ETH vols are currently more skewed for puts than calls till Oct,"" QCP said in a Telegram broadcast. ""This is surprising given the overwhelmingly bullish sentiment. It possibly indicates that the market was well positioned for this move and was quick to profit by selling calls.""  Telegram CEO Pavel Durov could be free as soon as Wednesday, French prosecutors said. However, Polymarket isn't confident he'll be released this month, with bettors putting money on a release during September. Durov has not yet been formally charged, prosecutors said. Instead, he is being held as part of an investigation that stems as a result of crimes allegedly planned or broadcast on Telegram, including money laundering, drug trafficking, child pornography and non-cooperation with law enforcement. Bettors say there's a 72% chance he'll be out before October, with shares of the yes side trading at 72 cents. Each share pays out $1 in USDC, a stablecoin, if the prediction comes true, and $0 if it does not.  Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius' administrator has distributed more than $2.53 billion to some 251,000 creditors, it said in its first status report on the payouts. The disbursements cover roughly two-thirds of all eligible creditors of the crypto lender by number and about 93% of the eligible value. Another 121,000 eligible creditors with an average distribution of around $1,500 have yet to successfully claim their distributions. ""Approximately 64,000 of these remaining creditors have a distribution of less than $100, and approximately 41,000 more have a distribution of between $100 and $1,000,"" the filing said. ""Given the small amounts at issue for many of these creditors, they may not be incentivized to take the steps needed to successfully claim a distribution.""  Chart of the Day  The charts shows BTC's returns by calendar month since 2013.  September is historically bitcoin's worst month, with an average return of -4.78%, which could be a grim outlook for BTC bulls after a challenging August which saw a fall to a near six-month low at $54,000.  Conversely, bitcoin's best calendar months have been October and November, with average returns of nearly 23% and 45% respectively.

The protocol's established tokens DAI and MKR will remain in circulation unchanged, and users can decide voluntarily to exchange.  MKR advanced over 4% immediately after the news.  The changes are part of the protocol ongoing overhaul called Endgame.  MakerDAO, one of the oldest and largest decentralized finance (DeFi) lenders, is getting a new name and new tokens as part of its on-going revamp.  Maker has rebranded to ""Sky,"" according to a press release on Tuesday. The protocol, which has $7 billion of assets, will also introduce new versions of its $5 billion stablecoin {{DAI}} and governance token {{MKR}}, called the USDS stablecoin and the SKY governance token.  DAI and MKR will stay in circulation unchanged, with the new tokens existing in parallel. Token holders will be able to exchange DAI tokens 1:1 for USDS, while each MKR token can be swapped for 28,000 SKY tokens. The new tokens will be issued on Sept. 18, and holders can voluntarily choose to keep the old tokens or exchange for the new ones.  MKR's price gained over 4% immediately after the news, and is up 2% over the past 24 hours, outperforming bitcoin {{BTC}} and the broad-market crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 index (CD20).  ""The fundamental factor was how to grow DeFi to gigantic scale, something as big as Tether or even bigger,"" Rune Christensen, MakerDAO's co-founder, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Tether issues the $116 billion USDT, the largest stablecoin on the market.  Christensen spearheaded the protocol's major, multi-year overhaul called the ""Endgame."" As part of the process, he first laid out plans of introducing ""upgraded"" versions of the platform's stablecoin and governance token in May 2023 in a governance forum post.

32895226,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637965,1724758207,Expert Explains Why Bitcoin Price Could Explode To $1 Million This Cycle,"In the latest episode of the What Bitcoin Did Podcast, hosted by Peter McCormack, Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, made a stunning prediction for the Bitcoin price. Mallers speculated that BTC could reach a valuation between $250,000 to $1 million in the current economic cycle. Mallers grounded his prediction in the broader context of global economic practices and central bank policies, emphasizing the unprecedented nature of today’s financial challenges and opportunities. Why Bitcoin Is Poised To Reach $1 Million Mallers highlighted the global debt-to-GDP ratio, which has surged beyond 300%, as a critical indicator of economic imbalance. “Global debt tells you how much time and energy from the human population and its future have been borrowed,” Mallers explains. He argues that this disproportionate ratio signals that governments are borrowing future resources extensively without a feasible plan for repayment. This practice, he suggests, is akin to borrowing from future generations, reducing their potential quality of life and economic freedom. Related Reading: Here’s When Bitcoin Is Predicted To Break Its All-Time High If History Repeats “Looking at Global debt, you can see how much time and energy from the human population and its future have been borrowed. Then if you look at the growth which is what that metric tells us they’ve borrowed a lot of our future and a lot of our time and energy with no way to pay it back,” Mallers remarked. The Strike CEO is concerned that this could lead to significant economic and social challenges, particularly as governments struggle to manage these debts without resorting to measures such as currency debasement. Currency debasement, a reduction in the value of money caused by increasing the money supply, is seen by Mallers as a likely governmental response to unsustainable debt levels, which could erode wealth and savings at an individual level. “I think everyone’s speculation is that currency debasement is the way out for the government. You can steal the time and energy of everyone alive,” Mallers argues. In this context, Mallers positions Bitcoin as a critical tool for financial autonomy. By converting their wealth into Bitcoin, individuals can opt out of their government’s economic mismanagement and protect their assets from inflation and potential currency devaluation. He emphasizes that Bitcoin’s fixed supply—capped at 21 million coins—makes it immune to the inflationary tactics that governments might employ, unlike fiat currencies which can be printed at will. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tops & Bottoms Occur When This Metric Spikes, Analytics Firm Reveals Mallers is particularly critical of central banks’ practices, especially their manipulation of economic cycles through market interventions. He argued that these interventions have prevented necessary economic adjustments and purgings of inefficiency that are essential for healthy economic dynamics. Such actions have stymied the natural entropy of economic systems, leading to artificially stabilized but fundamentally vulnerable markets. “I’ve been on record saying I think Bitcoin is going to $250,000 to $1 million long before Trump or any of these rumors or whatever else it’s solely predicated on we’re likely to see the greatest asset bull market in the history of bull markets. why? because central banks have progressively price fixed everything whenever something breaks. they don’t let the business cycle complete,” Mallers predicts. Central to his critique is the role of central banks in the bond market. Unlike other markets like real estate and equities, which have seen significant interventions to maintain stability, the bond market remains less protected, according to Mallers. This market is crucial as it underpins much of the global financial system, including the strategies governments use to manage public finances. Mallers predicts a scenario where central banks might soon find themselves unable to maintain control over the bond market without resorting to extreme measures such as massive money printing. He projects that such actions would likely result in an asset price inflation unseen in any prior market cycle. Mallers forecasts: “So this is the cycle where central banks try and price fix the bond market. The quantity of money printing will be astronomical, you’re going to get 2, 3, 4 or 5 COVID’s worth of printing and I think it’s going to send assets astronomically. High gold, real estate, equities. All right and then Bitcoin is the only truly fixed asset we’ve ever had, and so Bitcoin will outperform everything orders of magnitude.” At press time, BTC traded at $62,870.

42390559,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd2nzp,1724756597,Telegram CEO's Arrest Is Unlikely to Be the Last: Galaxy,"The first major arrest of a prominent messaging or social media company CEO may not be the last, Galaxy said.  Telegram and Durov were probably resisting takedown or information requests, the report said.  Some of the charges could be linked to Telegram's integration with TON or the blockchain's presumed use in illegal activity, Galaxy said.  The detention of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov in France is the first major arrest of a prominent messaging or social-media company boss for failing to sufficiently police its platform. It is unlikely to be the last, Galaxy Research said in a report on Monday.  Governments have been hostile to cryptography and encryption for some time, the report noted after Durov was held over the weekend.  Telegram and Durov were likely resisting takedown or information requests from Europe or, more specifically, the French government, Galaxy said. Telegram is closely linked with The Open Network, or TON, blockchain, which was originally an internal project at the platform before being discontinued and taken up by independent developers.  ""The extent to which the charges against Pavel involve TON, or Telegram's integrations with TON, is not known,"" wrote Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy.  TON is also the native crypto token of the TON blockchain, formerly known as the Telegram Open Network. The cryptocurrency fell over 14% following French media reports of Durov's arrest at Le Bourget Airport.  ""It is possible that some of the 'fraud' or 'money laundering' charges could revolve around Telegram's integration with TON and/or TON's use in illegal activity,"" Thorn wrote.  TON, the blockchain, has more than 350 validators globally, but it is unclear how many of these Telegram operates, if any, the report said. Therefore, it's not clear ""how resilient TON can be in the case that France or any other major governments attempt to attack it or to take it down as part of Durov's arrest.""  Galaxy noted that TON's value is substantially dependent on its integration with the messaging app.  How TON can avoid being involved with Durov and Telegram, or how other blockchains can avoid being targeted for aiding criminality, will likely depend on how decentralized they are, the report added.  Durov could be freed as soon as Wednesday according to French prosecutors. However, betting platform Polymarket isn't confident he will be released this month, with participants putting money on a release before the end of September.

Crypto bank Xapo will contribute to the initial capital.  The fund, set to launch in September, will be available to corporates, businesses and professional investors, according to an announcement on Tuesday.  ""We believe that offering the right products for participants in the space who are aiming not only for exposure to the Bitcoin price, but also structured ways to grow the Bitcoin value of those investments is a natural evolution of the asset class,"" Xapo Director Joey Garcia said.  The firms have not said specifically what the fund's fees will be, though did say they will be ""at a lower level than other 2% and 20% hedge funds"". This refers to a fee structure where the manager charges 2% as a management fee and 20% as a performance fee on the fund's upside.

India's Information Technology Ministry asked the Nation's Home Ministry for an update into the Telegram investigation after CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in France.  Telegram, perhaps the most prominent messaging service used by the cryptocurrency ecosystem, is under scrutiny in India, but there is no immediate danger of a ban, multiple reports have indicated.  India's cybercrime wing has been probing Telegram for misuse in criminal activities and the instant messaging service could be banned in the world's largest democracy if the agency deems it so, Indian news outlet Moneycontrol reported, citing a government official.  A ban is not imminent and Telegram is compliant with India's Information Technology (IT) rules, unnamed sources from the Ministry of Home Affairs told the nation's Republic News. The sources also said that the investigation is focused on the potential misuse of Telegram in a major controversy, the exam paper leak scandal of the test for admissions to the nation's undergraduate medical programs.  The Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre falls under the Ministry of Home Affairs and is conducting the probe in coordination with the Ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY).  News agency PTI reported that MeitY asked the Home Ministry for an update on where things stand in the Indian context and if there are any violations in India after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in France over the weekend.  India has previously banned TikTok, along with 58 other Chinese apps, after deadly conflict on the border with China. However, a court case by the Indian government against WhatsApp and its parent firm, Meta hit a roadblock. ""As a platform, we are saying, if we are told to break encryption, then WhatsApp goes,"" the platform's advocate told an Indian court.  ""Locally, a Telegram ban will have a lasting negative impact on the business development and marketing of the more than 300 solid web3 projects from India,"" said Ayush Ranjan, CEO of Huddle01, a DePIN dedicated to making real-time communication performant. ""Millions of Indians are active members...disrupting this communication would also impact the price formation of projects’ tokens. If the ban goes through, people will have to move to other app.""  India has also blocked foreign crypto exchanges in the past, even if it wasn't entirely clear how many Indians used VPNs or Virtual Private Networks to continue accessing the platforms. The nation overturned the ban for at least some of those exchanges after they were licensed.

Nigeria's money laundering case against crypto exchange Binance, detained executive Tigran Gambaryan and fugitive Nadeem Anjarwalla will resume on Sept. 2, a month earlier than planned, after defense lawyers asked for the trial to be brought forward, Gambaryan's family said.  The hearing had been set for Oct. 11. Gambaryan and Anjarwalla were detained by officials in the country in February. Anjarwalla has since escaped. Binance is also facing a tax-evasion trial in the country.  Gambaryan, the exchange's head of crime compliance, has been held in Kuje prison, which also houses members of the Boko Haram terrorist group, for five months and his health has deteriorated.

32893138,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637954,1724752836,Dogecoin: Will History Repeat Itself? What This 3-Year Pattern Means,"One of the favorite meme coins has again been in the headlines. Recent price action suggests that Dogecoin might probably be bottoming as it sets itself in for what could turn out to be a big bull run. This has market observers looking toward some specific technicals that have signaled price surges in recent weeks. These indicators, marked through green and red lines, are currently penetrating, which raise hopes that the rally could start from the first week of September. Related Reading: Solana’s Popcat Balloons 96% In A Week – The New Token To Watch? There are also reasons for optimism stemming from the cyclic nature of Dogecoin’s price rise. Recently, analysts have noted that DOGE has a sharp hike in price each three years. $DOGE $10+ DOGECOIN?! Recent weeks price action has established a bottom for #DOGECOIN. Historically, bull runs begins when the green and red lines intersect, leading to a price surge in the following weeks. I anticipate a similar pattern this cycle, potentially starting as… pic.twitter.com/7JkYs7rUDn — Ðima James Potts (@DimaPotts36) August 26, 2024 In the first cycle, which started in 2016, Dogecoin’s price hiked 1.5 times at the end of the year. The second cycle, which began in 2020, saw that price multiply 2.5 times. If the same cycle continues, then experts say DOGE may finish off 2024 at nearly $0.31, over 3.5 times higher than where it is starting out at $0.09051. Social Media Buzz And Musk’s Influence Dogecoin is surging with the rise in price, and so is the ongoing social media buzz. DOGE has been trending on X for some days now. The development is partly occasioned by a recent tweet from Elon Musk, the Chief Executive Officer of SpaceX and Tesla. I am willing to serve pic.twitter.com/BJhGbcA2e0 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 20, 2024 In these regards, however, not everyone might be convinced that the momentum now surrounding Dogecoin will follow through. Some analysts do point out that while Dogecoin has made huge leaps — including amassing a market capitalization of over $90 billion — its inflationary supply status and weakening cultural importance may weaken its hold on the meme coin market at a later date. The speculations continue to rise that a new meme coin could take the lead over Dogecoin in this cycle. Combined market capitalization for DOGE and SHIB, according to CoinGecko, now makes up only 57% of the total market capitalization of all meme coins, which is well retracted from its highs. 2025: The Wild Card Year? Looking ahead, 2025 might be an important year for Dogecoin. Historically speaking, the fourth year of the cycle has been when DOGE saw the most substantial price increases. In 2017, during the first cycle, Dogecoin’s price went up as much as 9,000%. The second cycle in 2021 was even more outrageous: an 18,000% increase. If this were to hold good, then 2025 would promise to be a real roller coaster for investors. Yet, if these projections sound a bit too bold, it has to be remembered that past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Be that as it may, the cyclical analysis indeed provides an intriguing framework, but the market for meme coins is notoriously volatile and unpredictable. Related Reading: NEAR: Network Upgrade Gives Token 23% Price Boost – Details Bearish Sentiment And The Road Ahead Interestingly, while some analysts are predicting a bullish future for the cryptocurrency, others are more conservative. According to CoinCodex, the current sentiment is bearish, with Dogecoin expected to drop 3.84% and reach $0.090315 by September 25, 2024. The Fear & Greed Index currently reads 55, which suggests that investors are leaning toward optimism but with caution. The future of Dogecoin is as unexpected as its meme-generated beginning. With its large base and going toe-to-toe with Elon Musk in its visibility, market conditions depend on many things that range from global economic factors to the mood of online communities. As 2025 draws near, one thing is for sure: this will be one wild ride for DOGE.

QCP Capital noted options-market activity that suggests a generally bullish mood, but not an explosive move higher in the short term.  SafePal's SFPlus release boosted its SFP token value by up to 8% over the past week by adding rewards to encourage staking.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} slid under $63,000 early Tuesday as profit-taking after a weekend rally extended into a second day and weighed on the broader crypto market.  BTC fell 1.4% in 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, with ether {{ETH}}, BNB Chain's BNB, Cardano's ADA and xrp {{XRP}} falling as much as 2%. Memecoin dogecoin {{DOGE}} led majors lower with a 4% slide, while Ton Network's TON – hit by the arrest of the CEO of closely related Telegram – fell 4% to bring seven-day losses to more than 20%.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index of the largest tokens by market capitalization, fell 1.5%.  QCP Capital, Singapore-based trading desk, noted an increase in call spread buying while noting the selling of bitcoin calls at the $100,000 level. The strategy suggests a generally bullish mood, but not an explosive move higher in the short term.  A call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an asset at a specific price, called the ""strike"" or ""exercise"" price, on or before a specific date, called the ""expiration."" Calls are implicitly bullish. A put option gives the buyer the right to sell an asset at the strike price on or before the expiration date. A bull call spread consists of one long call with a lower strike price and one short call with a higher strike price. Both calls have the same underlying asset, such as bitcoin, in this case.  ""Even with higher spot, BTC and ETH vols are currently more skewed for puts than calls till Oct,"" QCP said in a Telegram broadcast. ""This is surprising given the overwhelmingly bullish sentiment. It possibly indicates that the market was well positioned for this move and was quick to profit by selling calls.""  SafePal's SFP gets staking boost  A new points feature for crypto wallet provider SafePal's SFP tokens has sent prices up as much as 8% in the past week, outperforming gains in bitcoin and other major tokens.  The so-called SFPlus update seeks ""genuine"" token holders who stake the tokens for a longer term instead of simply storing them as part of the wallet balance. Holders begin accumulating an online score that grows over time the longer the SFP is staked. The points can be redeemed for certain rewards.  ""Stakers can access exclusive benefits like airdrop rewards, discounts on our hardware wallets, and upgraded account tiers in our CeDeFi banking gateway among other features, and partnerships we've developed as a wallet suite seamlessly through SFPlus hub"" said CEO and co-founder Veronica Wong in an interview with CoinDesk.  ""This aligns the interests of loyal $SFP holders closer with our wallet users, and is part of efforts in addressing an industry issue where the growth of a project doesn't necessarily translate to its token holders, especially in the long term,"" she said.  ""It has only been a few days since the launch of SFPlus, but there is already close to 1.5 million $SFP staked from over 100,000 wallets, with continued steady growth despite the uncertain market conditions.""",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/27/bitcoin-drops-below-63k-on-profit-taking-as-safepals-spf-gets-points-boost,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d868cda7f7377f663377c6b7c2cefc9eaad118b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’s the first time a permissioned lending market will use Ethereum-powered Coinbase Verifications.  The aim is to provide instant liquidity without having to actually redeem the underlying T-bill.  Centrifuge, a startup specializing in blockchain-based tokens representing real-world assets (RWAs), has established a lending market relying on collateral from several U.S. Treasury-backed tokens using lending firm Morpho’s system of vaults.  The market, aimed at institutions, will reside on Base, the Ethereum layer-2 network developed by crypto exchange Coinbase, and allow for the collateralization of and borrowing against the Centrifuge-affiliated Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund (LTF), Midas Short Term U.S. Treasuries (mTBILL) and Hashnote’s U.S. Yield Coin (USYC).  Porting real-world assets, particularly traditional financial instruments such as tokenized T-bills, to blockchains has become something of a trend in crypto. It’s an area Centrifuge began to focus on as far back as 2017.  Going back just a few years, when Centrifuge was experimenting with RWA markets on DeFi platform Aave, the challenge was these tokenized assets were not very liquid, recalls Lucas Vogelsang, co-founder of Centrifuge. These days, short-term assets like Treasury bills make the lending use case much more viable, and the market has also grown a lot, he said.  “This RWA market with Morpho aims to give these tokens utility,” Vogelsang said in an interview. “If you hold a Treasury bill and you need a bit of USDC for a couple hours, or days, or whatever, you can have that access without having to go through the complicated process of redeeming it, waiting for the issuers to give you the dollars back and possibly pay fees. So, basically instant liquidity without having to actually redeem the underlying asset that you're using to borrow.”  Circle-issued USDC is the second-largest stablecoin by market cap.  The collaboration marks the first time a permissioned lending market uses Coinbase Verifications, which allows a Coinbase customer to self-attest they’ve been KYC’d by Coinbase following the Ethereum Attestation Standard.

""These outflows have also coincided with relatively muted search interest and subdued network activity,"" analysts led by David Glass wrote.  This weaker demand is also evident in futures funding rates, which briefly turned negative in August, the bank said.  Citi said that ETF flows may continue to disappoint until the market has more transparency on the ""soft-landing versus hard-landing outcome"" for the U.S. economy.  Stablecoins have bucked this recent negative trend in digital assets, with supply continuing to grow despite the market correction in August, the report added.

The probe follows the arrest of the app’s CEO Pavel Durov in France over the weekend. Telegram Faces Potential Ban In India According to recent reports by Indian media outlets, the investigation is being led by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre under the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Update: Analyst Sees 65% Chance Of Retest Before Surge To $68,000 The report notes that Telegram boasts over 5 million registered users in India, making it one of the country’s most widely used messaging platforms. However, the government’s concerns stem from allegations that the app’s peer-to-peer communication features have been allegedly exploited by “bad actors to facilitate illicit activities.” The fact that Telegram does not have an office in India is reportedly complicating the government’s efforts to regulate and investigate the platform, despite the app’s compliance with India’s Information Technology (IT) Rules. Reports suggest that the app could even face a potential ban in India depending on the findings of the investigation. Durov Accused Of Allowing Criminal Activities The investigation in India has taken on added significance following the detention of Durov at the Paris-Le Bourget Airport on Saturday, as reported by Bitcoinist. Durov, who holds citizenships in Russia, France, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and St. Kitts and Nevis, is reportedly being accused of failing to curb criminal activities on his platform in the European country. The French authorities have suggested that Telegram’s encryption tools have allowed criminals to “flourish” on the app. However, Telegram has pushed back, insisting that the company complies with European Union (EU) laws and content-moderation policies, and calling the claims “absurd.” The arrest has reportedly sparked a backlash from Russian politicians, with some suggesting that it could be “politically motivated.” Russia’s top human rights official, Tatyana Moskalkova, claimed that French authorities arrested Durov because they want to shut down the censorship-free platform. Toncoin (TON) Price Tumbles Amid these mounting legal troubles for the messaging app, Toncoin (TON), the cryptocurrency originally developed by Telegram, has seen losses of over 20% in the seven-day time frame and is currently trading at $5.39. However, in a 24-hour time frame, the token has also seen a price drop of nearly 8%, further demonstrating the bearish sentiment surrounding the TON price among investors after the news broke over the weekend.

42407734,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga2DeW,1724746507,Celsius' Bankruptcy Plan Administrator Pays Out Over $2.5B,"Celsius has distributed over $2.53 billion to more than 251,000 creditors as part of its bankruptcy process.  Another 121,000 eligible creditors have yet to successfully claim their distribution.  Celsius' bankruptcy administrator has distributed more than $2.53 billion to some 251,000 creditors, it said in its first status report on the payouts.  The disbursements were made in liquid cryptocurrency and cash at Jan. 16 prices. They cover roughly two-thirds of all eligible creditors of the crypto lender by number and about 93% of the eligible value, the administrator said in a Monday court filing. Another 121,000 eligible creditors with an average distribution of approximately $1,500 have yet to successfully claim their distributions.  ""Approximately 64,000 of these remaining creditors have a distribution of less than $100, and approximately 41,000 more have a distribution of between $100 and $1,000,"" the filing said. ""Given the small amounts at issue for many of these creditors, they may not be incentivized to take the steps needed to successfully claim a distribution.""  The bankruptcy is officially closed after the United States Southern District of New York Bankruptcy Court approved a reorganization plan in November. The plan to distribute more than $3 billion to Celsius creditors was determined at the end of January. In the seven months since, the ""distribution process contemplated by the Plan is likely the most complicated and ambitious distribution process ever attempted in a chapter 11 case,"" the filing said.  The plan involves distributing liquid crypto, cash and common stock in MiningCo – the new company that evolved out of Celsius – to around 375,000 creditors in over 165 different countries. Because ""Celsius was not a fully regulatorily compliant business prepetition, and many regulators were pursuing enforcement actions against the Debtors"" the complexity of the distribution process has increased, the filing said.  Earlier this month, Celsius asked the bankruptcy court to order Tether to relinquish bitcoin worth some $3.3 billion based on allegations that Tether labeled a ""shakedown"" litigation that it would contest.

A Major Price Drop On The Horizon? According to a post by XBTManager, a contributor on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, Bitcoin’s price rise last week, which saw it temporarily break out of its recent range, was accompanied by a surge in volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised for a 200% Rally as Analyst Spot Rare Bullish Pattern This uptick in activity included a significant transfer of Bitcoin by short-term holders, with 33,155 BTC moved, as indicated by the 1-week to 1-month spent output age bands. This transfer of assets, particularly by short-term holders, could signal an immediate selling pressure on the market, potentially leading to a short-term price pullback. Meanwhile, despite the chances of a major drop on the horizon given the gradual increase in sellers, Bitcoin has recently managed to reclaim the $65,000 mark, albeit briefly; it has since retraced and is currently trading below this level. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is holding steady at around $63,000, reflecting a 1.2% decline over the past 24 hours. The report suggests that if the activity within these age bands continues to increase, traders should exercise caution as the selling pressure could intensify, leading to further volatility in the Bitcoin market. Short Term Price Outlook On Bitcoin Amid these developments, renowned crypto analyst Ali has shared his short-term outlook for Bitcoin, focusing on its current price action. In a post published today on X, Ali noted that Bitcoin appears to be trading within a parallel channel in the lower time frames. For context, a parallel channel refers to a chart pattern that forms between two parallel lines, where the price of an asset moves back and forth between the upper and lower boundaries of the channel. The upper boundary typically acts as resistance, while the lower boundary supports. Analysts often look for breakouts above or below these channels to signal potential reversals or continuations of a trend. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready to Soar? Key Indicators Signal Potential $72K Target Ali pointed out that if Bitcoin’s support at $63,500 holds, the cryptocurrency could rebound to $64,200 or even $64,800. However, if the support level fails, a drop to $62,800 might be on the horizon. #Bitcoin seems to be trading within a parallel channel on the lower time frames.

The price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $560 resistance zone. BNB price started a fresh decline from the $592 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $565 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $560 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $560-$562 resistance zone. BNB Price Eyes Recovery After struggling to test the $600 resistance, BNB price started a fresh decline like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The price declined below the $585 and $572 support levels. There was also a move below $560. Finally, the price found support at $548. A low was formed at $547 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $560 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The pair is now trading below $565 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $558 level and the trend line. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $592 swing high to the $547 low. The next resistance sits near the $562 level. A clear move above the $562 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $570 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $592 swing high to the $547 low. A close above the $570 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $585 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $592 level in the near term. More Downsides? If BNB fails to clear the $560 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $550 level. The next major support is near the $548 level. The main support sits at $542. If there is a downside break below the $542 support, the price could drop toward the $530 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $515 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone.

42407731,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga2DXu,1724737152,Telegram CEO Pavel Durov Could Be Free by October: Polymarket Bettors,"Telegram CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in France over the weekend.  Bettors on Polymarket are putting money on him remaining in custody after the 96-hour deadline prescribed by courts, as there's a growing belief he may be formally charged.  Telegram CEO Pavel Durov could be free to go as soon as Wednesday local time, French prosecutors said. However, Polymarket isn't confident he'll be released in August, with bettors putting money on a release before the end of September.  Durov has not yet been formally charged, prosecutors said. Instead, he is being held as part of an investigation that stems as a result of crimes allegedly planned or broadcasted on Telegram, including money laundering, drug trafficking, child pornography, and non-cooperation with law enforcement.  Bettors say there's a 72% chance he'll be out before October, with shares of the yes side trading at 72 cents. Each share pays out $1 in USDC, a stablecoin, if the prediction comes true, and $0 if it does not.  As Durov was arrested on Saturday, August 24, 2024, at 8:00 PM local time when his plane landed at Le Bourget airport, a general aviation airport north of Paris, he could be held until Wednesday, August 28, 2024, at 8:00 PM, but bettors have their money on an extended stay.  The press release indicates that if investigators uncover sufficient evidence during questioning, Durov's detention could be extended, or he could be formally charged and moved to pre-trial detention. This possibility likely fuels market skepticism about his release by the initial deadline.

From the daily chart of the UNIUSDT, the token is down 62% from March highs, though prices have stabilized in the past few trading weeks. To put in the numbers, chart data shows that it is up nearly 35% from August lows, absorbing selling pressure. UNI Is Down But Uniswap Generates $50 Million In Revenue So Far Though UNI is far off from all-time highs, shaving nearly 85% from 2021 peaks, other exciting developments might help prices in the long term. Token Terminal data on August 25 shows that the DEX has generated $50 million in revenue so far. Related Reading: Toncoin Tumbles To $4.6 As Bears Eye Further Decline, Will Support Hold? Uniswap allows traders to trustless swap tokens on multiple platforms and blockchains. Originally, it launched on Ethereum in November 2018 before being deployed on the BNB Chain and various layer-2 platforms for Ethereum, including Arbitrum and Optimism. Unlike Binance, which is custodial, Uniswap users only need a non-custodial wallet to connect and swap. All trades are smart contracts-led and without an intermediary. At the same time, there is a broader pool of tokens, some of which are unavailable on top centralized exchanges like Binance. The advantages offered by Uniswap have seen the protocol expand the assets under management to over $4.73 billion, according to DeFiLlama. As of August 26, Uniswap is available on over ten platforms, but the protocol manages over $3.8 billion on Ethereum. Cumulatively, DeFiLlama data has generated over $2.3 billion in fees. All these fees are from swaps on Ethereum and all other platforms. In the last 24 hours, Uniswap has generated over $854,000 in fees. Is The Future Bright, Developers Prepare For V4 As crypto prices expand, it is also highly likely that DeFi activity will rise. Since the recovery from mid-October 2023 to the March 2024 high, DeFi total value locked (TVL) more than doubled. This expansion reflects rising interest and confidence from the community. According to DeFiLlama, DeFi TVL across all networks stood at around $40 billion in October but rose to over $106 billion by March 2024. As DeFi TVL rises, Uniswap will enable more swaps, increasing its fees. Moreover, the DEX will be a go-to platform as it enhances its protocol. Related Reading: XRP Set To Explode? Top Analyst Predicts $33 Rally Earlier this month, Uniswap Labs, which is developing the protocol, announced a $2.35 million prize pool for developers.

Despite this slight pullback, analysts remain divided on the immediate future of Bitcoin, with some pointing to key technical levels that could determine the next significant move. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Sounds Alarm: Here’s Why It’s Your ‘Last Chance To Buy Bitcoin’ Next Step For Bitcoin Renowned crypto analyst, Emperor on X, shared his insights on Bitcoin’s price action earlier today. In a detailed post, Emperor noted that Bitcoin had successfully bounced from a critical support zone of around $58,000, which he had previously identified as a potential buy zone. According to Emperor, Bitcoin has now reclaimed the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the 4-hour chart, which he views as a positive development. He highlighted that Bitcoin’s recent price movement, including front-running the quarterly open and sweeping weekend range lows, is characteristic of a strong uptrend. Emperor suggested that while Bitcoin may not see a continuous upward push this week, it remains bullish, with the next target being the monthly open. The analyst concluded, noting: I will be taking some profits on swing positions. Ultimate direction is up but now is the time to take profit on Bitcoin gradually while you bid alts. Is Another Noticeable Correction Going To Happen? While Emperor’s analysis points to a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, other analysts are more cautious. Macro Johanning, another well-known figure in the crypto space, provided an update on Bitcoin’s recent price action, noting that Bitcoin had recently swept the high at $65,100. Johanning suggested that this move to the upside might have temporarily exhausted Bitcoin’s bullish momentum, potentially leading to a dip to around $61,000 before further upward movement. He highlighted the importance of upcoming economic data releases in Bitcoin’s short-term direction. Johanning pointed to several key events scheduled for the week, including the release of US Consumer Confidence data on Tuesday, Nvidia’s earnings report on Wednesday, Q2 2024 GDP data, and July Pending Home Sales on Thursday, followed by July PCE Inflation data on Friday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Challenge at $65K: Can It Break Through? These events will likely influence market sentiment and add volatility to Bitcoin’s price action.

Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $63,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading below $63,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. The current price action suggests that the price could slide further toward the $61,750 support zone. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $58,572 swing low to the $64,950 high. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $63,500 level. The first key resistance is near the $64,000 level. A clear move above the $64,000 resistance might send the price further higher in the coming sessions. The next key resistance could be $65,000. A close above the $65,000 resistance might spark more upsides. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $66,500 resistance. More Downsides In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $63,500 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $62,500 level. The first major support is $62,200. The next support is now near the $61,750 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $60,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $62,200, followed by $61,750.

Bitcoin Supply In Profit Has Seen Multiple Dips Into “Transition” Zone Recently As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained, the recent “Supply in Profit” trend could suggest a potential entry into the transition zone for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Are Still Fearful: What Needs To Happen For A Turnaround? The Supply in Profit here refers to an on-chain metric that, as its name suggests, keeps track of the percentage of the total circulating BTC supply that’s currently holding some net unrealized profit. The indicator works by going through the transfer history of each coin on the network to check the price at which it was last moved. As the previous transaction of any coin is likely to represent the last time it changed hands, the price at its time could be considered its cost basis. If this previous transfer price for any coin is lower than the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, then that particular coin is holding a net gain right now. The Supply in Profit adds up all coins that satisfy this condition and calculates what part of the supply they make up for. There also naturally exists an indicator called the Supply in Loss, which works similarly to the Supply in Profit, except that it keeps track of the tokens of the opposite type. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply in Profit over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Supply In Profit is currently at 85%, meaning 85% of all tokens in circulation are holding profits. This is a notable value and has historically corresponded to the bull market phase of the cycle. That said, the metric has only reached the current value after the latest price recovery to the $64,000 level, as it had slipped under the 80% mark earlier, which had put it inside the transition zone between bull and bear phases. While it’s certainly not a negative development that BTC has recovered back into the bull market zone, the recent pattern may raise doubts about whether this recovery can last. The chart shows that the indicator also saw the same trend of dipping into the transition zone and recovering in July. That surge didn’t last for too long. The quant has also pointed out how the Bitcoin Supply in Profit has been in an overall downward trajectory in the last few months, raising the chances of the metric going down again shortly. Related Reading: These Are The Biggest Bitcoin Support & Resistance Zones, Analyst Reveals In the scenario that the indicator does witness another drawdown into the transition zone, then it’s possible BTC could end up going through a period of downturn that may even lead to a new bear market. It only remains to be seen how the Bitcoin price, and thus, the Supply in Profit, develop in the coming days. BTC Price Bitcoin has enjoyed a surge of almost 10% in the last seven days, which has taken its price to $63,900.

32879397,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=637870,1724720410,"Solana (SOL) Ripe For Price Discovery, Analyst Eyes $600 Target","Market watchers have praised the Solana (SOL) price action throughout the month. The fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has displayed a strong performance despite the market shakeouts, recently reclaiming the $160 support level. Analysts suggest that SOL might repeat history and kickstart a rally toward a new all-time high (ATH) soon. Related Reading: BONK About To Enter 3rd Wave, Analyst Reveals Next Target Solana Breaks Out Of Consolidation Range In August, Solana’s strength was tested during the market retraces. Several analysts deemed SOL one of the strongest assets this month, noting its performance in the last three weeks. SOL’s price dropped over 30% during the first crash, falling to $110 before recovering. A week later, the token saw another retrace back to the $140 support level but maintained a sideways move between the $140-$155 range until Saturday. Some market watchers claimed the token was in a “great place” to accumulate as it was “still in the same sideways range, while the rest of the market made lower lows.” Moreover, they predicted that Solana would take off as soon as Bitcoin (BTC) surged. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has propelled 10%, hovering between the $63,000-$64,000 range over the weekend. SOL has also seen a favorable price action, soaring 13.9% in the last three days. SOL broke above the $155 resistance level on Saturday after an 8% surge. The cryptocurrency continued its ascendant trajectory, reaching the $162 mark before retracing. Throughout the weekend, the token continued to move within this new range. Is SOL About To Rally To $600? Solana’s recent performance has sparked a bullish sentiment among investors and experts. Some analysts have noted that holding the current levels could kickstart SOL’s next leg up. Ali Martinez recently shared that the $164 resistance level was key for Solana’s rally. Per the analyst, the token has been shaping up for an “Adam & Even” pattern, which suggests a potential rise to $164. If the token were to clear that resistance, its price could see a 33% surge toward the $220 price range, a level not seen since late 2021. Similarly, Altcoin Sherpa set the $165 resistance as a level to watch. Sherpa considers that SOL is moving within “an interesting level” but suggests that investors “be patient for a break of $165.” According to the post, a break above this level could propel the price toward the $188 and $201 resistance levels. Meanwhile, a failed attempt could send the price to the previous range. However, Sherpa believes the cryptocurrency will “solidly” break its ATH price in Q4, regardless of the outcome. Crypto analyst Jelle stated that SOL is “looking more and more ready for expansion, especially against ETH.” To Jelle, Solana’s chart looks ripe for price discovery since it resembles SOL’s performance three years ago.

This performance was followed by a massive surge that drove the price to SOL’s ATH of $259. Based on this, Jelle considers that Solana is ready to rally toward a new ATH between the $450-$600 range this cycle. SOL is currently trading at $160, a 2% and $13.9% surge in the daily and weekly timeframes.
