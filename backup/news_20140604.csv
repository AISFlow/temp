42377302,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70IrP,1401919928,Bitcoin Conferences Proliferate Across Asia and Australia in 2014,"A clear sign that digital currency is truly going global is apparent in the increasing number of bitcoin conferences taking place in different parts of the world this year, most particularly in Asia and Australia.  There are several significant events upcoming in the greater region, where attendees can catch presentations and panels featuring some of digital currency's top leaders and thinkers.  Conference organizers like Mediabistro have already proven their ability to organize successful events, such as the Inside Bitcoins conference series in places like New York, Berlin and Las Vegas. In addition to the events below, the company will also hold bitcoin conferences in Seoul in December and Singapore in January 2015.  Then there are new starters in the field, such as Australia's Informa and other independent conferences, proving that competition in the digital currency event space is almost as healthy as that among digital currencies themselves.  So why not get out the diary, reserve one of those ridiculously cheap Asian low-cost airline seats, and start researching local bitcoin-accepting businesses to visit while attending the following bitcoin events?  Inside Bitcoins Hong Kong  This event, to be held on 24th-25th June, bills itself as ""Asia's Largest Bitcoin Conference"", with 45 speakers and 20 seminary sessions, including heavyweights Bobby Lee (BTC China), Leon Li (Huobi), and Brock Pierce of the Bitcoin Foundation.  The event also features speakers from all areas of the Asian digital currency ecosystem, including Rui Ma of 500 Startups, Antony Lewis of itBit, Zennon Kapron of Kapronasia, mining ASIC maker Rock Xie, and Dave Chapman of ANX.  Inside Bitcoins Melbourne  Despite a healthy bitcoin economy, Australia hasn't featured so prominently on the conference circuit so far – but it's about to make up for it with two conferences within the same month.  The action starts with Inside Bitcoins Melbourne, from 9th-10th July. Speakers include Asher Tan of CoinJar, investors Domenic Carosa and Niki Scevak and numerous others from Australia's startup scene, plus international guests Edan Yago of Epiphyte and Josh Zerlan of Butterfly Labs.  Cryptocon Sydney  Cryptocon's two events, both in the last week of July, share several of the same speakers on an agenda that highlights the economic connections between Singapore and Australia.  The inaugural conference will take place in Sydney from 24th-25th July. International invitees include Emmanuel Abiodun of Cloudhashing, Elizabeth Ploshay of the Bitcoin Foundation, and Safello's Frank Schuil.  Local speakers include Jason Williams of BitPOS and Tristan Winters of ICE3x, and Domenic Carosa in a conference encore.  Cryptocon Singapore  As well as international invitees Jonathan Levin of Coinometrics, Jackson Warren of Bitcoiniacs and 'Bitcoin Jesus' Roger Ver, the 28th-29th July conference features local entrepreneurs Anson Zeall of CoinPip and Tembusu ATM founders Jarrod Luo and Peter Peh.  Cryptocon's organizer, Jonny Peters, says his events move on from debate over security and whether bitcoin is a currency or commodity, and onto the more interesting opportunities presented by block chain technology itself.  ""Through its tag line 'The Internet of Money has Arrived', the event makes a big statement and encourages the discussion to move towards something way bigger,"" he said, explaining:  ""The blockchain is a solution that solves the inherent problems of the Internet – credit card fraud, inefficient and cumbersome payment systems, and personal privacy issues. These three factors create a consumer distrust of the Internet. The billionaires of the next decade will be those who take advantage of this solution – this is where Cryptocon positions itself.""  BitcoinExpo China 2014, Shanghai  Promoting itself as ""The Largest of All Bitcoin Conferences"", Shanghai's BitcoinExpo will also be mainland China's second major bitcoin event for the year – not bad for a country often inaccurately accused of 'banning bitcoin'.  Final dates and a speaker list are yet to be finalized, but the event will cover three days in September this year. Organizers have also issued invitations for sponsors and exhibitors.

42377331,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70JCn,1401916907,Study: Speculation Isn't the Sole Driver of Bitcoin Prices,"There are a number of factors claimed by market-movers, observers and everyday investors as to what exactly influences the price of bitcoin. However, one new study has analyzed key drivers in the bitcoin market, and its findings could have an impact on how investors approach digital currencies in the future.  For example, the authors notably found that while there is a great deal of connectivity between the two, there is no clear evidence that the Chinese bitcoin market has a significant impact on activity in USD markets.  Entitled “What are the main drivers of the Bitcoin price?”, the paper by Ladislav Kristoufek of the Institute of Economic Studies at Charles University in Prague explores the economic, financial and perceptive catalysts for changes in the price of bitcoin. To do so, it leverages wavelet coherence analysis, a mathematical tool for data analytics, when examining information from the bitcoin market.  Kristoufek noted in the study that the properties of bitcoin, compared to other currencies, make it ideal for analysis, saying:  ""Compared to the standard currencies such as the US dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and others, bitcoin shines due to an unprecedented data availability. It is completely unrealistic to know the total amount of the US dollars in the worldwide economy on a daily basis. However, bitcoin provides such information on daily basis, publicly and freely.""  He added: ""Such data availability allows for more precise statistical analysis"".  China's influence  Kristoufek acknowledges that major bitcoin events in China have an impact on the broader global market. Indeed, he concedes that both markets “tend to move together very tightly both in prices and in volumes” when looking at data from 2013.  Yet, he argues that the relationship lies primarily in volume, whereas prices are less connected. This, Kristoufek asserts, means that the interactions between these two markets might be less significant than some observers claim.  He wrote:  ""Even though the USD and CNY markets are tightly connected, we ﬁnd no clear evidence that the Chinese market inﬂuences the USD market.""  However, Kristoufek notes that China remains an ""important player"" in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Bitcoin not a safe haven  The paper also explored the concept of bitcoin as a safe haven asset, one that would theoretically be leveraged during times of economic strife.  Kristoufek uses the case of the financial crisis in Cyprus as a lone example. Utilizing the Financial Stress Index from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, as well as the price of gold denominated in Swiss francs, he paints a picture that suggests bitcoin has not - at least yet - been treated as a safe haven asset.  The author suggested that there are correlations between the event in Cyprus and the use of bitcoin as a safe haven, explaining:  ""Apart from the Cypriot crisis, there are no longer-term time intervals where the correlations are both statistically signiﬁcant and reliable (in a sense of the cone of inﬂuence).""  Additionally, there were few indications of a deep relationship between bitcoin and movements in gold - arguably one of the world’s key safe haven assets - leading Kristoufek to conclude that ""we find no signs of bitcoin being a safe haven"".  Market perception  Among Kristoufek’s findings is the idea that investor interest and the overall popularity of bitcoin puts pressure on prices, but that the forces are not equal during upswings and downturns in the market.  He used Google and Wikipedia searches for “bitcoin” and sought correlations between those search terms and dates when notable changes in the price of bitcoin occurred.  Kristoufek found that the velocity of price gains and losses in bitcoin is ‘asymmetrical’, writing:  ""The interest and prices are then negatively correlated and the interest still leads the relationship. However, the correlations are found at lower scales than for the bubble formation. The interest in bitcoin thus seems to have an asymmetric eﬀect during the bubble formation and its bursting – during the bubble formation, the interest boosts the prices further, and during the bursting, it pushes them lower.""  He added negative interest in bitcoin appears to be more impactful than positive interest in regards to the price, saying that this creates “a more rapid eﬀect during the price contraction than during the bubble build-up.  Fundamental forces  According to Kristoufek, there are plenty of observers of bitcoin who say that speculation remains the key driver of price changes. While he doesn’t directly dispute this statement, he posits that there are fundamentals which can be found to influence the market.  He wrote:  ""Even though bitcoin is usually labelled as a purely speculative asset, we ﬁnd that standard fundamental factors – usage in trade, money supply and price level – play a role in bitcoin prices in the long term.""

42377305,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70IwR,1401912656,CoinJar Returns to Apple App Store With Features Restored,"Australia-based bitcoin wallet and exchange provider CoinJar has announced that its iOS app is now available for iPhone users in the UK and Australia.  The news follows the Cupertino, California, company's surprise App Store policy update issued 2nd June, which indicated that apps could facilitate the transmission of ""approved"" virtual currencies provided they did so in accordance with state and federal laws.  Despite the widespread enthusiasm that followed the announcement, it remains unclear to many in the bitcoin community as to what exactly the policy change means for bitcoin and other digital currencies, which are still fighting to define their regulatory status around the globe.  Nonetheless, the reintroduction of CoinJar's app to the marketplace is a potentially positive one given that Apple had previously banned the company's app from its store.  Company CEO Asher Tan took to Twitter to broadcast the news, though he didn't offer many details as to how CoinJar was able to receive approval:    (Re)-Introducing CoinJar for iPhone in Australia & the UK. https://t.co/MSYAWeRkzI      — Asher Tan (@ashertn) June 3, 2014    Community reaction  Though the full ramifications of the news are uncertain, reaction in the bitcoin reddit community was overwhelmingly positive regarding the news.  CoinJar co-founder Ryan Zhou took to reddit to offer some additional news, suggesting that his company's approved iOS app would soon be more widely available.  Zhou said:  ""[The] CoinJar app will be available in the following countries in 24 hours: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland [and the] UK.""  At press time, users were reporting success with the app's bitcoin sending functionality.  Optimism begins  Blockchain CEO Nic Cary told newsBTC that his company would be looking to resubmit its app to Apple for review and that he was cautiously optimistic about the possibility of his company's app being approved.  Apple's anti-bitcoin policies have been one of the biggest threats to the proliferation of bitcoin, given the company's large market share in the US.  Still, until such time as those apps are reviewed it will remain unclear as to the full ramifications of Apple's news. At press time, CoinJar had not responded to press inquiries.

42395319,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLVZ,1401908791,"KnCMiner Titan to Deliver 400 MH/s, Tape-Out Imminent","UPDATE (5th June 13:30 GMT): KnCMiner has announced the tape-out of its Titan scrypt miner. This means every detail in the chip design has been finalized and it is now moving on to manufacturing, no chip design changes are possible beyond this point.  The company said the first batch of Titan miners will ship “well within” the promised timeframe for pre-order customers, which is the third quarter of 2014.  KnCMiner also told CoinDesk that the first batch of Neptune miners is expected to ship before the end of the current quarter, ie by the end of June. The company could not specify an exact date, but one will be announced as soon as possible.     KnCMiner has announced that it has almost finalised the design for its upcoming Titan scrypt ASIC, although it did not provide further details as to when the tape-out would take place.  Most notably, KnCMiner also announced a product update, saying the Titan will deliver up to 400 MH/s – a sizable increase over the original output estimate.  When it was first announced back in March, KnCMiner said the Titan would deliver 100 MH/s, but, just days later it revised the spec and said the scrypt miner would churn out 250 MH/s.  With the latest revision, the Titan should deliver a fourfold performance boost over the original spec.  New versions unveiled  KnCMiner also previewed two new versions of the Titan miner as part of its second batch, which are available for pre-order from the company's web store starting today. The new rigs are expected to be ready for delivery about a month after the first batch is released.  KnCMiner says the latest revision will not have a significant impact on power consumption and thermals:  ""In this run, we've been able to upgrade the Batch Two 'Mini' Titan to 200 MH/s, and the 'standard' Titan to 400 MH/s, while still keeping power consumption and thermal disturbance as low as possible. We've also made great strides in noise reduction and packaging, aiming for a sturdier product altogether.""  The team has also unveiled new chip art. This little KnC logo, measuring 0.16mm across, will be embedded in every single Titan die.  Keeping up with competition  KnCMiner's announcement follows Alpha Technology's revision of its Viper scrypt miner spec, which will now deliver up to 250 MH/s of power. When Alpha made the news, KnCMiner was promising 250 MH/s from its flagship Titan miner.  Less than a month ago, KnCMiner said it would initiate tape-out of Titan ASICs within a few weeks, saying shipments will commence in the second or third quarter of 2014. With Q2 drawing to a close and no tape-out announcement yet, Q3 is starting to look like a more reasonable timeframe, though the process could be accelerated.

Winners are eligible for numerous cash prizes totaling $15,000.  MIT BitComp  , organised by the group that is giving $100 in bitcoin to every undergraduate this fall, will take place over three rounds between now and the end of August.  The goal, according to the organizers, is to invigorate the community ahead of the launch of what some are calling the world’s first ""bitcoin economy"", a concept explored at the MIT Bitcoin Expo in May.  Organisers explained:  ""To support the development of interesting projects, we’re launching the MIT BitComp to inspire and motivate MIT students and alumni to develop bitcoin-related apps.""  The first deadline is set for 22nd June, with three $250 prizes to be awarded to the best 250-word app pitches received at that time.  Promoting MIT innovation  According to organizer Jeremy Rubin, the project stems from the wider MIT Bitcoin Project and will use funding from that initiative to support the prizes. He added that all prizes will be dispensed in US dollars.  The rules allow for diverse teams to be formed, but each one must enlist a current or former MIT student. No external funding can be used for the project, and no entry fee is required.  The second round will reward three demonstration videos with cash prizes of $750 apiece. The deadline for this stage is 27th July.  A panel of judges, which is expected to be composed of community and industry members, is in the process of being formed, according to Rubin.  Categories for competition  The last round calls for practical demos of the applications developed by 24th August. Five topic prizes worth $1,500 each will be given away, with a grand prize of $5,000 being awarded to the top app of the final stage.  There are five categories for the final round:  The Awesome Award - will be given to the app that is the most creative or fun of the crop  The Engineering Award - will award the app that best demonstrates ""the capabilities of bitcoin""  The Evangelism Award - will go to the team that best introduces bitcoin to new users  The Improving MIT Award - honors an app that aims to increase the quality of student life at MIT  The Next Billion Award - will be awarded for the team that focuses on furthering the adoption of bitcoin.

42377321,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70JBX,1401898775,Red Flags Raised Over Hong Kong Bitcoin Exchange HKCex,"UPDATE (5th June): This article has been updated with AIA's comment    When Claus, a computer technician in the UK, came across a new exchange based in Hong Kong, his interest was piqued. He was looking to make a return on his litecoin and Hong Kong exchange HKCex offered a higher litecoin to bitcoin rate than others.  Claus deposited 1,000 LTC to HKCex on 15th May and was pleasantly surprised when his HKCex account balance showed an extra 88.8 LTC. It turned out that the new exchange was offering a promotional bonus on deposits. Claus hadn't even noticed the sweetener.  ""I thought their prices were inflated due to the abundance of USD deposit methods and low market depth as they were a new exchange,"" he said.  Articles announcing HKCex's $27m worth of investment and chatter on forums like BTC-e allayed some of Claus' doubts about depositing funds with a new exchange. He had used less well-known platforms without a problem in the past.  ""I felt [HKCex] were trustworthy,"" he said.  But when Claus flipped his 1,000 LTC for 26 BTC and wanted to withdraw the balance, his pleasant experience soon turned sour. He noticed his withdrawal's status was changed from 'processing' to 'rejected'. He was then told to send a notarised copy of his passport to HKCex in Hong Kong because his account had been flagged for money laundering. Claus still hasn't received his funds today.  Claus is a pseudonym for a HKCex user who wants to remain anonymous. He shared screenshots of his HKCex account with CoinDesk. He was also a Mt. Gox customer and suffered a $9,200 loss on his account there.  HKCex, which claims to have raised millions in funding, now faces allegations of fraud valued at more than $120,000 from customers who can't withdraw their funds, according to a crowdsourced spreadsheet.  CoinDesk has found that one of the exchange's alleged investors has denied any involvement with the company. Furthermore, public records in Hong Kong also throw up inconsistencies with the exchange's claims.  HKCex investor denies involvement  In mid-May, HKCex announced it had raised an audacious amount of new funding: $27m. This would have put it ahead of Circle, one of the best funded startups in the bitcoin economy, in terms of investment raised. (CoinDesk reported on HKCex's first claimed funding round, for $2m, in January)  When CoinDesk asked for more information about the investors, HKCex named one of them as Hang Seng Bank, Hong Kong's second-largest bank. Lavin Lam, who signed off as the exchange's marketing and public relations executive in emails, said the bank had put in $9m in the latest round.  ""I'm sorry, we can't disclose information about our investors except one public bank – Hang Seng Bank. They will invest about $9m in crypto-currency trading,"" Lam wrote.  However, a check with Hang Seng Bank revealed that the claimed millions in funding for HKCex isn't there. When contacted with details about the investment, a spokesperson for the bank said:  ""Hang Seng Bank has no connections or banking relationships with Hong Kong Crypto Exchange (HKCEx).""  Missing bitcoin ATMs  Another bold claim made by HKCex – that it would install 30 bitcoin ATMshttp://hkcex.net/press/2014-02-25.html in Hong Kong by the year's end – couldn't be corroborated. When CoinDesk asked the exchange who would manufacture the machines, Lavin Lam replied that they would be made by manufacturing giant Foxconn.  As the world's largest contract manufacturer of electronics, an entry into the bitcoin ATM market by Foxconn would be significant. Foxconn usually follows a ""strict policy"" of not commenting on products it makes for clients, according to its public relations firm, Burson Marsteller.  However, when Foxconn was presented with details of the alleged HKCex bitcoin ATMs, its spokesperson returned with a negative response after an internal check.  ""No business group has acknowledged [a contract with HKCex for bitcoin ATMs],"" spokesperson Simon Hsing said.  When Hang Seng Bank and Foxconn's denials were put to HKCex in an email to Lavin Lam, there was no response.  One piece of information listed on the HKCex website did check out. The exchange claimshttp://www.hkcex.net/about/why-hkcex that its servers are located in the SunnyVision Data Centre, among the ""most reliable"" server housing environments in Hong Kong. SunnyVision confirmed that the HKCex IP address is in its portfolio and is in use by a client.  HKCex also claimed in a press release that it was in talks with AIA to insure customer deposits. The insurance firm denied any relationship with HKCex when contacted by CoinDesk.  ''We have had no discussions with this organisation and we do not underwrite this kind of insurance,"" AIA Group's director of group corporate communications in Hong Kong, Sonia Tsang, said.  Worldcoin Alliance distances itself  HKCex has also alienated some potential allies. The Worldcoin Alliance, a group that promotes that particular altcoin, announced a partnership with the Hong Kong exchange on 18th May.  The partnership would have created new ways to buy worldcoin through bank transfer and credit card payments, and allow the altcoin to be traded with fiat currency. Three days later, though, the group announced the partnership was off.  ""We identified some red flags that warrants the worldcoin community be more cautious. We therefore chose to suspend this cooperation until we are fully convinced that HKCex.net is in fact a legitimate exchange service,"" a Worldcoin press release said.  A Worldcoin Alliance spokesperson told CoinDesk the organization had concerns over the following issues: worldcoin users who were still waiting for their fund withdrawals, a period of time when the HKCex website appeared to have gone offline and the lack of SSL encryption on the website.  Potential breach of licence  When CoinDesk checked HKCex's details against public records held by Hong Kong's Companies Registry, inconsistencies were exposed.  According to HKCex's website, the exchange is operated by a company called MG Foreign Exchange Limited. According to the registry, the firm was incorporated on 11th October last year. It has only one director, a man named Wong Kin Lung.  However, Wong's name doesn't appear anywhere in HKCex's management team page. In fact, two men named Pheng Cheah and Long Liang are listed as co-founders. The firm's registry records also show that its paid-up capital is HK$1. Ian Barlow, a Hong Kong-based security consultant, noted: ""The single director does appear unusual, particularly in a money-handling business.""  Furthermore, the exchange could face a run-in with the authorities because of inconsistent addresses, according to Barlow. HKCex lists MG Foreign Exchange's Money Service Operators (MSO) licence on its website. However, an issue arises because the company isn't operating at the address on the licence.  Barlow, who is also a director of the Hong Kong chapter of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, pointed out:  ""The terms of the MSO licence are quite specific ... If [HKCex] isn't operating at the registered address, that would be a breach of its licence terms.""  HKCex lists its operating address as 57 Belcher's Streethttp://www.hkcex.net/contact on Hong Kong island. Its licenced address, however, is an office building called MG Tower across Victoria Harbour in Kowloon. According to MSO licence guidelines, the registered address must match the premises where the money changing or remittance service takes place.  The Commissioner of Customs and Excise, which oversees the MSO licence, could publicly reprimand and impose a penalty of up to HK$1m on a licence holder that is found to have contravened its terms.  Link to MG Group?  A further check with public records showed that Wong is a director of 52 companies in Hong Kong. These include firms with names like World Toilet Research Centre Limited, and also a clutch of financial firms with 'Marigold' or 'MG' in their names.  These firms are referred to as the MG Group in the company literature of a Belize-registered broker called Marigold Global Markets. The group resides in MG Tower in Kowloon, which is where HKCex's claimed parent company is also located.  Two MG Group companies that CoinDesk looked at have significant paid-up capital. A gold bullion dealer called Marigold International Bullion Dealers was incorporated in June 2007 with a paid-up capital of HK$13m ($1.7m). It is also a member of the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society, where Wong sits on the executive and supervisory committee.  A futures broker called Marigold International Securities was started in 2009 with a paid-up capital of HK$23m ($3m). The firm has also gained trading rights in derivatives markets in Singapore and London in recent months.  However, besides the potential MSO licence breach and the confusion over HKCex's investors and ATMs, none of the facts discovered suggest any actual wrongdoing on the part of MG Foreign Exchange or its director, Wong. Indeed, it's possible that MG Foreign Exchange doesn't actually operate the bitcoin exchange. So far, HKCex's claim is the only link between it and Wong's company.  CoinDesk contacted Wong for comment via his gold bullion dealing company, but has not received a response.  The trust deficit  Even as Mt. Gox's slow implosion in February remains fresh in the memory of cryptocurrency traders, new exchanges are launching all the time to capitalise on the growing number of bitcoin and altcoin users. In response, some exchanges have submitted to basic audit-like checks that they have enough funds to cover customers' account balances.  Still, if an exchange can entice deposits worth hundreds of thousands with nothing more than a website and loud claims about funding and partnerships, then it's clear that the fundamental problem of trust between customer and exchange remains unsolved. That's a problem for the wider bitcoin economy to consider.

42377326,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70JFJ,1401894923,Swiss Regulators Block Zurich Bitcoin ATM Launch,"Bitcoin Suisse AG, a Switzerland-based digital finance broker and bitcoin ATM operator, has abruptly cancelled the planned launch of its newest, Zurich-based unit at the request of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).  In a reddit post addressing the action, Bitcoin Suisse AG stated that in light of the government's request, it has also suspended all other planned bitcoin ATM launches and halted services for its existing ATMs.  A representative from Bitcoin Suisse AG stated:  ""The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has requested Bitcoin Suisse AG to suspend the launch of the Bitcoin ATM pending clarification of open legal questions.""  Bitcoin Suisse AG told CoinDesk it has further reached out to the necessary domestic regulatory authorities, but that it had no further comment on FINMA's actions.  The company, however, remains optimistic about its ability to provide ATM services to the local bitcoin ecosystem, stating that it expects to have its units online before the end of June.  Notably, the Lamassu ATM installed by Bitcoin Suisse AG for Bitcoin Boulevard in the Netherlands will not be affected, as the company reports it has since sold its ownership of the device.  Overstated significance  Though potentially troubling to those in the global bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin Association Switzerland president Luzius Meisser believes that FINMA's actions are not as reactionary as many fear and suggested that the authority is simply following its usual course of action when faced with new services and technologies:  ""Some news sites reported that FINMA demands a banking license to run an ATM, but I think that is unfounded speculation and it would surprise me if it were true.""  Meisser went on to suggest that this is just the latest example of FINMA being ""extra-cautious when it comes to bitcoin"" while it learns more about the technology.  However, he added that he believes that, under current law, bitcoin ATMs can be run for non-commercial purposes, provided they earn less than a certain sum in fees annually and don't allow the exchange of bitcoins between users. Commercial providers, he said, should be able to operate provided they join self-regulatory organisations.  Possible solution  The news that Bitcoin Suisse AG would be forced to halt its services comes at a time where bitcoin seems to be facing increased scrutiny in the global banking and finance center.  Earlier this May, a government report concluded that it would be illegal for Switzerland-based bitcoin companies to pay workers in the digital currency. Though, it did suggest that bonuses and other forms of bitcoin compensation would not violate current regulations.  The Swiss Parliament is however considering treating bitcoin as a foreign currency, a move that what was widely hailed as progressive by local bitcoin enthusiasts and activist groups.  Meisser said that this proposal has since been sent to a federal council after passing a preliminary vote, and that he is optimistic that the results could reopen bitcoin ATM services in the country:  ""Should the federal council answer as suggested, that would immediately clarify a lot of legal questions and put Switzerland into the pole position to becoming an international centre for cryptocurrencies.""

42377318,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70J91,1401890656,Xapo Bitcoin Debit Card to Launch This Month,"Bitcoin wallet provider Xapo has announced it is to launch its much-awaited bitcoin debit card this month.  The card, which caused quite a stir in the bitcoin community in April, will roll out by the end of June to be accepted by any business that accepts debit cards or credit cards from its network partner, says Xapo. The company has yet to disclose the name of the partner and the card network, however.  The possibility had been raised that the Xapo card would launch on the MasterCard network, but this turned out not to be the case.  However, as industry news site Payments Source points out, Xapo has a number of potential partners aside from big brand cards such as MasterCard and Visa. Independent network rails such as Star, Pulse or MAC would allow merchants to accept debit transactions even if they are not affiliated with a particular bank.  Hands-off approach  A significant problem for the youthful bitcoin community is that big banks and card operators have proved reluctant to deal with cryptocurrency-related businesses. MasterCard says it is keeping track of legislative developments related to bitcoin, though, so this situation could change in the future.  Madeline Aufseeser, who is a senior analyst at the Aite Group covering credit and debit card issues, told Payments Source that she believes banks could issue and operate bitcoin debit cards in theory, but in practice it could prove tricky.  ""Most non-financial institutions don't realize the extent of due diligence and requirements of becoming a licensed issuer,” she warned.  Aufseeser also argued that major card networks would highly scrutinise any connections with bitcoin, as they would prefer not to tarnish their reputation with the lingering associations people make between digital currencies and illicit activities.  Demand is high  Xapo started accepting pre-orders for its debit card in April, charging a $15 one-time shipping and handling fee, and limiting users to one card per wallet account. The company indicates that customer demand has been strong, but has not disclosed any numbers.  This is not the first attempt at a practical bitcoin debit card. Coincard and Cryptex cards were announced a while ago, but Xapo insists its system has advantages over these rivals. Notably, while users of Coincard and Cryptex cards must preload them with bitcoins and manually convert bitcoins, users of the Xapo card do not, as it debits directly from the wallet.  A further issue with merging bitcoin with traditional card networks is that users will still have to pay standard debit card fees. However, for many this is an acceptable trade-off, as they would gain access to a huge ATM and merchant network. As always, there is a price to pay for convenience.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/04/xapo-bitcoin-debit-card-to-launch-this-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5fdc30cb9717b247004840fc4ccfb0e1077ff486-1200x627.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377316,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70J3z,1401885753,Gallery: Behind the Scenes at Prague's New Bitcoin Center,"While bitcoin is a purely digital currency, there has been a growing movement by the community to provide interested newcomers with a real-world introduction to its merits.  Bitcoin Center NYC  and La Maison du Bitcoin in Paris, for example, serve as physical destinations where novices can ask questions while ardent enthusiasts network, take classes or otherwise consider the larger implications of the innovation.  Opened 28th May in Prague, The Client Center WBTCB.CZ joins this list with the aim of fostering bitcoin awareness and enthusiasm in the Czech Republic's largest city.  Located in Prague's Smíchov district – a popular shopping destination – the project is one of the first big moves from Czech bitcoin startup world BTC business (wBTCb), which aims to make its mark providing local cryptocurrency trading services.  The design process  Martin Stránský, CEO of wBTCb, explained that the company's Client Center has been in production for half a year – a necessary amount of time given the work needed to prepare and design the center itself:  ""The choice of materials, design of individual components – that all took some time. Moreover, the whole historical building went through complete reconstruction.""  Stránský indicates great care was taken to ensure that the Client Center would provide an attractive backdrop to its client services, and that it could be easily replicated.  If successful, wBTCb hopes to explore franchise opportunities with global members of the bitcoin community looking to bring similar projects to their home country.  A look inside  In total, wBTCb's Client Center provides 125 square meters of bitcoin-centric space, divided over two floors.  The first floor provides a contact zone for clients, as well as a bi-directional Robocoin bitcoin ATM that allows for a maximum withdrawal of 25,000 Kč, or roughly $1,200.  Stránský went on to further explain the potential of this space, saying:  ""The lower floor is now like an open office for my team, which can be easily converted into a space where events and lectures will be organized with topics such as virtual currencies, business plans in this area, startups and more.""  If the first floor is more business-focused, the second floor will emphasize bitcoin's more creative side, said Stránský, indicating that the floor will house an art gallery where wBTCb will organize exhibitions for artists who accept payments in bitcoin for their work.  Developing services  wBTCb is launching with just a few services, though the company says it already has plans to expand the center. For example, while general bitcoin ATM users are limited to a 25,000 Kč limit, higher amounts are available to clients who register formally with the center.  Stránský explained that verification is necessary for transactions over this amount, as it must report this activity to comply with Czech law. However, he hinted that this could be the first step in identifying and providing more advanced trading services to local bitcoin users, saying:  ""We want to allow clients trading with virtual currencies, and bring additional services which we will inform about soon. The connection of clients across the world is the vision.""  Raising awareness  Compared to other European nations, the Czech Republic has been relatively quiet on matters relating to alternative digital currencies. To date, the Czech Republic has issued only guidance on bitcoin related to anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, according to BitLegal and the US Law Library of Congress.  However, Stránský is optimistic that his company's work will, in part, generate more enthusiasm for the technology in the country:  ""We are at the beginning, but there is certain level of awareness about bitcoins in the Czech Republic. [...] Our aim is to open the world of virtual currencies to the group of people that now have a lack of information.""  wBTCb indicated a full virtual tour will be available on its website soon.

42377323,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70J7l,1401880057,"Singapore Exchange itBit Slashes Fees, Adds New Features","Singapore-based bitcoin exchange itBit has lowered trading fees by as much as 50%, while also adding support for more payment options and new features to its platform.  The exchange says its new trading fees range from 0.12% to 0.20% per side and that it will not charge deposit or withdrawal fees, but only pass on bank charges.  'Cost effective option'  itBit  said in a statement that the new fees make it the most competitive exchange on the market:  “While we still use a 'maker-taker' model, we have significantly reduced the volume required to achieve lower pricing while reducing taker prices by 0.20%. Makers will continue to receive a 0.10% rebate. Combined, this makes itBit the most cost effective option in the industry.”  Clients who choose to deposit and withdraw Singapore dollars will be able to use GIRO and FAST money transfers. Furthermore, the exchange is sweetening the deal by offering a $20-$150 trading fee credit for three different deposit tiers.  European clients can now use SEPA transfers, thus reducing fees for deposits and withdrawals, while at the same time reducing interbank transfer time for all euro transactions.  New trading features  The exchange has introduced a new trading API that will allow users to place, review and cancel orders, and request bitcoin withdrawals or bitcoin deposit addresses.  The API also supports segregated trading wallets and transfers between such wallets, offering an additional layer of security to traders who choose to use the option.  Users can also view and export their complete trading and funding history. Additionally, the API also enables automated alerts triggered by various events, such as receiving deposits or withdrawal requests.  Ambitious approach  While itBit is a relatively fresh exchange, it has exhibited a fair amount of aggression so far. The exchange raised $3.25m to fund the expansion of its operations in late 2013, on top of $5.5m in previous funding.  Talking to CoinDesk, itBit executives made it clear that their goal is to bring a new level of professionalism, reliability and security to bitcoin trading.  Earlier this year, itBit started offering attractive incentives for bitcoin traders who decide to switch exchanges and last month it hired former PayPal compliance officer Erik Wilgenhof Plante and SecondMarket trader Bobby Cho, who will focus on business development.
