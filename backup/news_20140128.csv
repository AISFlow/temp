The TerraMiner IV is the first professional miner to break the one terahash per second barrier.  It is based on CoinTerra's new GoldStrike I processor, which the company describes as the most powerful SHA256 ASIC ever released. Its peak performance stands at over 500 gigahashes per second on a 28nm chip, built by GlobalFoundries.  ""Handing over the first TerraMiner marks a major milestone for CoinTerra. It goes to show that through hard work and determination with the right team in place, great things can be accomplished in an incredibly short timeframe,"" said Ravi Iyengar, CEO of CoinTerra, Inc.  The GoldStrike I is said to be clocked at 1.4GHz and up to four will be used in TerraMiner units. The chips run at 0.765 volts and, since it uses the latest Globalfoundries 28nm high performance plus node, the unit should be rather efficient as well. The same process is used in AMD's latest Kaveri processors, which launched earlier this month. This means miners are getting cutting edge technology, as 20nm high performance nodes are still unavailable. The first 20nm ASIC rig should be KnCMiner's new Neptune, when it comes to market.  Manufacturing process  ""We are delighted to be the silicon supplier and physical design house for CoinTerra's industry leading TerraMiner platform,"" said Asim Salim, VP Operations for Open-Silicon.  ""Manufactured on GlobalFoundries 28nm technology node, the silicon was delivered in a special custom package with testing completed in an unprecedented cycle time of 49 days from tapeout.""  Each TerraMiner IV rig features two PCBs with two GoldStrike I chips each. The rig employs two separate water cooling systems, one for each PCB. The heat exchangers feature three fans, while a couple of fans are mounted at the front of the rig to ensure plenty of airflow.  The TerraMiner IV is priced at $5,999, but CoinTerra says its order books are filled through April 2014. Only the sixth batch can be pre-ordered, with shipments scheduled for May 2014.

42425361,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwErh,1390932027,Charlie Shrem Resigns from Bitcoin Foundation Following Silk Road Arrest,"BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem has resigned from the Bitcoin Foundation's board of directors following his arrest over money laundering allegations.  The US government has accused Shrem of working with Robert M Faiella, also known as 'BTCKing', to launder money from drug sales on Silk Road through his bitcoin exchange startup BitInstant.  A statement from the Bitcoin Foundation reveals Shrem, who was its vice chairman, submitted his resignation this morning.  Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation, said:    ""As a foundation, we need to remain focused on our core mission to standardize, protect, and promote the Bitcoin core protocol.      While Charlie has contributed a great deal of personal effort and resources to enhance the adoption of Bitcoin worldwide, a prolonged legal dispute would inevitably detract from advancing that core mission.    Therefore, in order to focus on his pending trial, it has been mutually decided that Charlie Shrem resign from the Board of Directors, effective immediately. The Board accepted that resignation today.""    The foundation's statement goes on to stress it doesn’t condone illegal activities and ""values transparency, accountability and a high level of responsibility"" towards its members and the overall bitcoin community.  However, the statement also emphasises that the indictment is against Shrem and Faiella, not bitcoin or the community at large.  The complaint states: “Bitcoins are not inherently illegal and have known legitimate uses.”  Reaction  News of Shrem's arrest sent shockwaves through the bitcoin community yesterday. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who invested $1.5m in BitInstant two years ago, issued the following statement:    ""When we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws – including money laundering laws – and we expected nothing less. Although BitInstant is not named in today’s indictment of Charlie Shrem, we are obviously deeply concerned about his arrest.      We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials. We fully support any and all governmental efforts to ensure that money laundering requirements are enforced, and look forward to clearer regulation being implemented on the purchase and sale of bitcoins.""    Tom Robinson, co-founder of bitcoin storage insurance firm Elliptic, said bitcoin, like any other currency, can be misused if it falls into the wrong hands.  ""And just like with any other currency, these people can be tracked down and brought to justice. In fact, if anything, it's easier to track illicit activity if bitcoin is used, thanks to the public block chain,"" he added.  Robinson went on to say he hopes yesterday's developments will have a positive impact, making digital currency businesses even more diligent about their anti-money laundering practices.  Brayton Williams, co-founder of Boost VC, a startup incubator heavily focused on bitcoin, said he is disappointed to see this kind of news surface again. However, he termed it a ""mild setback"" in the short term and thinks it will have no overall effect in the long term.  ""I just hope people do not get side-tracked from what is important, the good use-cases of bitcoin, instead of thinking about the negative possibilities,"" he added.  Like the foundation, Williams stressed that bitcoin is not the evil in instances of money laundering, the people involved are.  Burden of proof  Nic Cary, CEO of bitcoin website and wallet Blockchain.info, said: ""The burden of proof is on the government. It's important to remember that these are simply accusations. Charlie is innocent until proven guilty. As far as the impact this had on bitcoin... bitcoin is resilient.""  Members of the bitcoin community had plenty to say about the Shrem arrest on Twitter.  Alan Silbert, founder of luxury goods marketplace BitPremier, said:    Can all bad actors in the #bitcoin world please exit so that we can continue progressing our brilliant innovation.      — Alan Silbert (@alansilbert) January 27, 2014      Vast majority of the #bitcoin community are smart, innovative, and above all, law-abiding.

42425354,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwEdh,1390928606,"51% of Techies Happy to be Paid in Bitcoin, Survey Finds","Event organiser Tech in Motion recently carried out an interesting survey on digital currencies. The findings are hardly surprising: techies love bitcoin.  Tech in Motion  sent out questionnaires to 18,000 members and 847 were kind enough to respond.  When asked whether they would like to be paid in bitcoin, 51.1% said ""yes, absolutely"". However, 18% said they would rather wait and see where bitcoin ends up in a year or two.  The remainder said they would rather be paid in cash, while 9.9% said they would not accept bitcoin payments, as they don't believe the currency will last. Only 1.18% of those asked said they had no idea what bitcoin was.  As we pointed out earlier, many geeks tend to have a love affair with digital currencies and the results of the survey are encouraging, although it was limited to tech professionals. In any case the results bode well for payment processor firms that are trying to get into the payroll market.  Regular folk  The Wall Street Journal reports that Bitpay is already developing such a service in the US, and it is talking to payroll processors in the hope of getting them on board. Across the border in Canada, Wagepoint has already teamed up with VirtEx to integrate bitcoin payments into its payroll services.  According to a Bloomberg poll carried out in 2013, bitcoin is not as popular among regular folk. The poll found that just 42% of Americans could correctly identify what bitcoin was, while 46% said they did not know what the currency was all about. A further 6% though it was an Xbox game, and another 6% mistook bitcoin for an iPhone app.  What's more, it is possible that a disproportionate number of bitcoin enthusiasts chose to take part in the Tech in Motion survey. After all, more than 17,000 people chose not to fill in their questionnaires.  Still, according to public relations outfit Shift Communications, Tech in Motion's membership covers a wide range of tech firms, from software developers to infrastructure companies and hardware makers.  Shift Communications account executive David Hefferman also points out that Truth in Motion carried out some ""rough polling"" in each city where its members are based, hence the numbers should be fairly consistent.

42425352,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwEXh,1390924867,Charlie Shrem Released on $1 Million Bail After Silk Road Money Laundering Arrest,"BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem has today been released on bail following a court appearance.  Shrem appeared before the US District Court in Manhattan this morning, walking out shortly after on a $1m bond.  The CEO was arrested at New York's John F Kennedy International Airport on Monday. He faces serious money laundering charges, brought by the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan.  Shrem is anything but a free man at this point. Under the terms of the bail agreement, he will remain confined to his parents' home in Brooklyn. Assistant US attorney Serrin Turner opposed bail, arguing that Shrem has a strong incentive to flee and the resources to do so. Shrem's net worth, which was brought up during the bail hearing, stands at $6m, The Daily Mail reports.  Keeping quiet  Shrem's lawyer Keith Miller insists that the allegations in the US Attorney's Office complain are ""simply allegations"" and that Shrem is presumed innocent, which goes without saying. However, Miller did not divulge much more than that.  It is highly unlikely that Shrem will make any statements, either, as they could hurt his case or possibly even violate the terms of his bail agreement.  The Winklevoss twins issued a statement yesterday, saying that the BitInstant management made a clear commitment to abide by all applicable regulations, including money laundering laws.  ""We expected nothing less,"" the brothers said in a statement, adding that they are deeply concerned by the arrest. The duo were eager to clarify their role as passive investors in BitInstant, adding that they will do everything they can to assist law enforcement officials.  Unanswered questions  Although Shrem was granted bail, this should not be taken as a sign of weakness on the part of the prosecutors. All in all, the bond is huge and it's clear that the US Attorney's Office considers him a flight risk.  The charges are very serious indeed. Shrem is not charged with simply facilitating money laundering through his exchange, but with having explicit knowledge of the dealings involving Robert Faiella, who sold more than $1m worth of bitcoins to Silk Road users.  Shrem appears to be unwilling to comment the allegations, along with Faiella.  The bitcoin community appears to be divided by the news. While some are hailing Shrem as a martyr figure and a victim of overzealous regulators, others are happy to see the back of him – arguing that such shady practices are giving bitcoin a bad name.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/28/charlie-shrem-released-on-1-million-bail-after-silk-road-money-laundering-arrest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8688e2d7459b02fea037959ae98aef232a503f3-998x666.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425364,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwF5h,1390910173,The Reality of Chinese Bitcoin Trading Volumes,"Posts on China's premier social network Weibo have suggested that some of the country's largest bitcoin exchanges are manipulating trading volumes to gain more customers and rise through the ranks of the world's most popular exchanges.      The sentiments have been reflected overseas as well, on forums like Reddit, Bitcointalk.org and Twitter.    Chinese trading activity could be having an effect on the worldwide bitcoin price once again, with prices dropping from a high of $859 to a low of $810 in trading over the past weekend.    This drop is pure evidence of market manipulation coming from china or traders at huobi live under a rock. Btc has been having great news...      — Mega Coin Trader (@MegaCoinTrader) January 24, 2014    Graphs and charts appear to back up the claims with some odd figures, with some showing bid prices for bitcoin actually higher than ask prices, or even dead level. The latter would be a coincidence on a genuine open market, the former almost impossible.  Trades on China’s now-largest bitcoin exchange, Huobi, show prices with four decimal places, higher than the maximum offered to customers on the web interface. There are also several trades with exactly the same price.  Shenanigans, right? But as a wise man once said: I’m sure you’ll find it’s more complicated than that.  At least one trusted Chinese bitcoin trading source told CoinDesk the charts pointed to manipulation from within, the result of either in-house trading bots or software that mirrors or mimics trades on rival exchanges to project an appearance of high volume.  Delicate dance  Until the People's Bank of China threw the local bitcoin business community into chaos in December last year with new regulations, it seemed pretty straightforward. BTC China was number one, with trade volumes and price records beating even Mt. Gox for much of 2013.  Things have changed since. Denied access to bank transfers and third-party payment processors, BTC China's volumes dropped as all exchanges scrambled for ways to stay in business under the new scenario. Some continued to transfer money via corporate and personal accounts, and BTC China introduced a voucher system.  OKCoin  and BTC China reintroduced trading fees, which had been absent from most Chinese exchanges in 2013 and possibly created higher volatility worldwide. Fee-free Huobi rose to top position and BTC China fell to third, even fourth.  But were the position shifts due to real market forces? Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China, said:  “We've known for a while that other Chinese bitcoin exchanges have been faking data. We've seen our trading volumes drop off heavily while others have, supposedly, witnessed massive surges.”  He explained there are two ways in which exchanges can fake data. “One is to just quote a higher number – to just artificially pad it by 20,000 BTC a day, the other is to actually fabricate trades.”  Lee said OKCoin got caught “red handed” fabricating trades a few weeks ago and has since lost a lot of consumer faith and trust. He went on to say that Huobi has now been caught doing the same and the evidence has been posted on Weibo.  Huobi's reaction  CoinDesk also spoke to Leon Li (Also known in China as Li Lin), founder and CEO of Huobi. He denied emphatically that any manipulation was occurring and said Huobi’s success was due to its fee structure. He said:  “Huobi does not need to exaggerate the volume of transactions, because we already have much more trading volume than domestic counterparts. There is no need to take the risk to cheat, it is not logical.”  “Also, I remind you, our trading volume have a great relationship with zero transaction fees, so it is not reasonable to compare us with the platform abroad which charge transaction fees.”  Fakery?    China-based bitcoin exchanges have been accused by users of manipulating trading volumes before, with some claiming to shift over 30,000 BTC in December amidst bitcoin's price plunge, and users claimed the actual number might be a tenth of that.      Some have suggested the high volumes are due to high-frequency trading (HFT) bots, and one said the exchange is able to split large orders into small ones. Other commenters have expressed either surprise or criticism at the exchanges' lack of transparency in general.      Xu Mingxing, CEO of OKCoin, has publicly stated a dislike for HFT software and the effects it has on exchange volumes, despite apparently allowing large trades through OKCoin's API.      All kinds of exchanges can fake volumes merely to gain attention, in the hope traders will see them as the most popular platform and move their activities there.    Grey area    It’s not just a matter of misreporting the facts. Sometimes, ‘fake’ is also ‘real’.      Companies can unleash bots on their own trading floors to profit through arbitrage, a move which appears to boost volumes, while making a profit for the company without paying any fees. Whether this constitutes fakery, or fraud, is a grey area as the trades are actually executed and ‘real’ traders may trade against them.      This kind of activity, along with 'mirroring' (or simply copying) trades made on other exchanges with real trades of your own, may not technically be wrong but it remains risky to try.    How can you tell?    It's difficult to tell for sure if exchange trading volumes are being manipulated. Chart and price anomalies are possibly a sign.      The primary way is to look at market depth charts, if such data is made public (and can itself be trusted).      This is determined by monitoring the number and activity of traders who count as 'market makers' within the market, posting buy/sell orders at specific rates and thus setting the price. If trading activity is not genuine, market depth is shallow and such orders will not be fulfilled, even when actual prices venture into the territory of the offers.

42425365,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwEzh,1390903590,Will America Follow Washington State's Lead and Classify Bitcoin as 'Money'?,"Over the past couple of months, numerous central banks and national regulators have issued warnings against the use of bitcoin and other digital currencies.  The US has not clamped down on bitcoin yet, though there are a number of restrictions hampering the adoption of digital currencies in the US. These include restrictive FinCEN rules, regulatory ambiguity and lack of a coherent policy at federal level.  For the most part, it is up to states to regulate the matter. New York State will hold public hearings on bitcoin this week, but it is unclear whether they will result in any significant conclusions or actions.  East Coast vs West Coast  Financial regulation  remains a controversial topic in the US, but unlike many controversial regulatory attempts in the country, support and criticism of digital currencies transcend party lines. This makes it very difficult to say with any certainty what US lawmakers and regulators may be about to do with respect to digital currencies.  Attorney Adam Ettinger told Bloomberg that any state that becomes bitcoin-friendly will see ""a huge increase in companies"" in the digital currency space. The fact that California has plenty of tech talent comes in handy, too. Ettinger explains:  “That will mean the brightest minds working on some of the most innovative payment technology we've seen in awhile.”  For the time being, efforts to rewrite – or simply write – the rulebook appear to be in the hands of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Geeks, by nature, love digital currencies – so there should be no shortage of popular support, at least not in California. State officials have reportedly met with lawyers and compliance experts to discuss the matter, but little is known about the talks.  However, the East Coast establishment is not as enthusiastic. Several high-profile bankers have already voiced their concerns, and the financial sector is not nearly as bitcoin-friendly as many tech companies and online retailers.  Legal ambiguity remains a problem  The legal status of bitcoin and other digital currencies in the US remains unclear, and the fact that the US has 50 different jurisdictions does not help. For example, the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions stresses that digital currency is a medium of exchange not authorized or adopted by any government.  In Washington digital currency is included in the definition of ""Money"" in the Uniform Money Services Act (UMSA), chapter 19.230 RCW:  ""Money means a medium of exchange that is authorized or adopted by the United States or a foreign government or other recognized medium of exchange. ""Money"" includes a monetary unit of account established by an intergovernmental organization or by agreement between two or more governments.""  As a result, Washington State requires companies wishing to transmit money to its residents to check whether they need UMSA licensing. If they do, then they must get a license before they can start operating.  However, in other states and on a national level, there is simply no consensus on the matter. Washington can be viewed as an exception, as most other states simply don't have any legislation applicable to digital currencies and they don't view them as ""money"" in the legal sense.  Last year, New York State decided to use subpoenas to encourage bitcoin startups to file additional documentation on their businesses. The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) plans to hold public hearings on the regulation of digital currencies on January 28th and 29th.  ""In August 2013, NYDFS announced that it had launched an inquiry into the appropriate regulatory guidelines for virtual currencies. As part of an ongoing fact-finding effort informing that inquiry, NYDFS subsequently announced its intention to hold a public hearing on this issue, including the potential NYDFS issuance of a ‘BitLicense’ specific to virtual currencies,"" the department said.  California is a bit more liberal. It requires digital currency companies that transmit money to obtain licences from the Department of Business Oversight. However, there are still a number of questions that remain unanswered.  Will other states follow?  California and New York tend to be bellwethers when it comes to financial regulation, so many believe smaller states will simply fall in line once they introduce their digital currency frameworks. It is, however, up to individual states to decide what to do next, as much of the regulatory authority is on the state level, not the federal level.  That problem will not go away. Without harmonized legislation across all 50 states, the use of digital currencies as money transfer vehicles could face numerous challenges. Sales tax is one example of unharmonised legislation in the US - some states have it, others don't and the rate varies from state to state. This fact irks consumers and businesses and if every state chooses to treat digital currencies differently, it could cause a lot more problems than a few different sales tax rates.  President of the Money Transmitter Regulators Association Stephanie Newberg says bitcoin will dominate the association's agenda due to its vague legal status. She said:  “Some states have statutes that are broad enough to do it immediately, other states don't. It's a state-by-state question.”  As if that wasn't enough, there are those who believe money transfer regulation should not apply to digital currencies at all.  Lawyer Marco Santori, who advises several bitcoin startups in New York, argues that bitcoin transfers should not be viewed as money transfers, as the funds aren't being transmitted. He believes the laws are woefully inadequate and nowhere near what they would have to be to regulate bitcoin businesses.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/28/will-america-follow-washington-states-lead-and-classify-bitcoin-as-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd33d447bc0473be8c416bb9855c2d3a0712641d-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425349,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwEZh,1390885728,New York Hearings Open in Shrem's Shadow,"This is perhaps New York's biggest ever news week when it comes to bitcoin. Some of it is positive, and some negative. This morning sees the beginning of a two-day hearing on bitcoin from the state's financial regulator. Elsewhere in the city, luminaries will meet at a breakfast hosted by the Economic Development Forum, to talk about the future of the currency. And then, there's Charlie Shrem.  New York has been an uncertain place for bitcoin-based businesses. Although regulations at the federal level have moved forward slightly, things are still inconsistent and unclear. And New York is the financial centre of the US, which makes the lack of regulatory information there particularly vexing.  The Department of Financial Services announced in November that it would hold the hearings, taking place today and tomorrow, after showing interest in how virtual currencies were unfolding in the state.  Who will be there  It describes the event as a fact-finding mission, where it will also discuss the possibility of a state-level regulations specifically for digital currencies, called a 'BitLicense'.  The hearings will see representatives from the financial, legal, government, and academic sectors. They will include Barry Silbert, founder of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, and the Winklevoss brothers, who are in the process of launching their own bitcoin ETF.  Charles Lee, the creator of litecoin, will testify, as will his employer Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of CoinBase. Venture capitalists Jeremy Lieu from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures will be there, as will legal experts Julie Rinearson from Bryan Cave, and Carol Van Cleef, from Patton Boggs. Computer scientist Ed Felten will testify alongside Susan Athey, Prof of economics at Stanford.  Most speakers were unwilling to talk to CoinDesk before the event, although Circle's Jeremy Allaire, who testified at the Senate hearings on bitcoin in Washington DC last November, is a veteran by now.  Don't reinvent the wheel  Allaire will be testifying at the New York hearings today. He acknowledges the need for a special digital currency licence, but is hoping that each state doesn't reinvent the wheel.  ""Unlike traditional MSBs (Money Services Businesses), using digital currency brings unique requirements around disclosure, as well as security and risk management for the protection of digital assets,"" Allaire says.  In particular, digital currency money services businesses don't get to store their customers' assets with federal reserve-backed commercial banks. Instead, they rely on private keys, and have to deal with new security requirements, such as cold storage and associated physical security protocols, he says.  But Allaire wants a standard state licensing framework, which he says should be managed by something like the CSBS (Conference of State Banking Supervisors).  ""We would be very concerned if each and every state financial department sought to categorize, classify and regulated digital currency firms with differing approaches, which would increase the cost of operating businesses in this important and innovative market,"" Allaire warns.  Businesses in the wings  The NYC's fact finding began a while ago. In August 2013, it sent subpoenas to 22 businesses that it felt were involved in the bitcoin space. One of them was operated by New York-based Andre De Castro, owner of RightClick LLC, who sought to launch a bitcoin service called eCoin Cashier.  De Castro asked FinCEN for a ruling on whether his would be a money services business, shortly after it issued its own guidance on virtual currencies last March.  He found out earlier this month that his business would not be an MSB under FinCEN rules. But he's still in the dark over his own state's approach, and whether it will be affected by the FinCEN ruling.  ""I cannot be 100% sure how New York State will respond to the ruling,"" he told CoinDesk. But he's still close to opening the business, at both a physical location and through a software application.  ""I believe that my business process, coupled with the FinCEN ruling will makes most states as comfortable as FinCEN has been with the ruling.""  With a FinCEN blessing behind him, De Castro may feel confident, but other businesses in New York will likely welcome more clarity. Those probably include the likes of Willard Ling, who mothballed a bitcoin ATM while he awaited a decision on state licensing.  Shrem's arrest  The hearings this week may be soured a little by the arrest of Charlie Shrem, the founder of apparently-defunct firm BitInstant, and one of New York's own. Shrem was arrested for facilitating trades through the Silk Road website, and even purchasing drugs himself with bitcoins. BitInstant received $1.5m in funding in the fall of 2012 from the Winklevosses, who will be testifying today.  ""When we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws - including money laundering laws - and we expected nothing less,"" said the pair in a statement. ""Although BitInstant is not named in today’s indictment of Charlie Shrem, we are obviously deeply concerned about his arrest.""  They then called for clearer regulation on the purchase and sale of bitcoins.  The timing couldn't be worse for the arrest of Shrem, who for a while was a leading light in the bitcoin community, right in the heart of the financial community.  Just one day after the arrest came to light, members of the bitcoin community will be defending its utility and benefits to a state regulator that has already expressed concern over ""narcotrafficking"".  While luminaries testify at the hearings this morning, the New York City Economic Development Corporation, effectively a government body, will host a breakfast discussion about the virtual currency, said reports.  The event, which is being co-hosted by the Partnership Fund for New York City, is called “The rise and risks associated with increasing Bitcoin usage."" Clearly, government interest in digital currencies is rising from all sides.  Check in to CoinDesk for more, as we report from the State regulator's hearings today.
