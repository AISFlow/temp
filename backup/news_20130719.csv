First the Pembury Tavern started accepting the digital currency, now The Old Shoreditch Station – a coffee shop near Silicon Roundabout.  On a recent flight between the French city of Perpignan and London, the owner of the coffee shop met a bitcoin evangelisthttp://bitcoineuphoria.com/london-silicon-roundabout-coffee-bar-the-old-shoreditch-station-now-accepting-bitcoin/, who extolled the virtues of the digital currency and convinced him to accept it as a payment method in his shop.  Nick Letchford, managing director at The Old Shoreditch Station, said: ""We are a forward-thinking business and have always prided ourselves on supporting all things progressive, be it products, artists or brands. Also, I am a big nerd and I love the idea of living in a Star Trek-like unified future – a borderless currency seemed like a step in the right direction.""  He went on to say he's still not entirely clued up on the specifics of bitcoin, but he thinks it will ""ultimately help address all manner of the problems"" society will face in the near future.  Letchford said the payment system is fully up and running in the coffee shop and that his staff have adjusted to it well.  ""It's early days, but so far no worries. To be honest, its as easy as doing a credit card transaction!"" he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2013/07/19/old-shoreditch-station-coffee-bar-in-londons-silicon-roundabout-now-accepts-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3adc9c0fbf7104cfc7d6be5ccbd0e09cc2f08da4-620x361.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397197,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXS8,1374260029,Bitcoin Foundation: 'FinCEN should clarify all virtual currency transactions aren't inherently suspect',"The Bitcoin Foundation has asked the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to make sure its rule against Liberty Reserve doesn't suggest all virtual currency transactions are inherently suspect.  The foundation has written a letter to FinCEN in response to its proposed rule on the 'Imposition of Special Measure Against Liberty Reserve S.A. as a Financial Institution of Primary Money Laundering Concern'.  In the rule, FinCEN states that ""Liberty Reserve's system is structured so as to facilitate money laundering and other criminal activity,"" and cites the anonymity of the system and the irreversibility of transactions as evidence of this.  It suggests that, due to this, financial institutions should be required to impose “special measures” against Liberty Reserve, S.A. under Section 311 of the Bank Secrecy Act.  The letter issued by the Bitcoin Foundation states it:  ""… does not take issue with the imposition of special measures against Liberty Reserve. Rather, the Bitcoin Foundation is filing these comments to urge FinCEN to clarify statements made in the Proposed Rule and the underlying Notice of Findings that could be misinterpreted to suggest that virtual currency transactions in general are inherently suspect.""  The foundation believes the detail in FinCEN's proposed rule could be misinterpreted to suggest all digital currencies are dubious from a money laundering perspective.  Patrick Murck, of the Bitcoin Foundation, told CoinDesk: ""While we have no intention of defending Liberty Reserve, we were compelled to point out the incorrect and unnecessary conclusions FinCEN drew with regard to private and irreversible transactions.  ""These inaccuracies have created a chilling effect in the banking industry as they deal with compliance issues in the virtual currency industry and the record demanded correction.""  Liberty Reserve was a Costa Rican-based, low-cost payment processing service that used its own digital currency, the Liberty Reserve dollar. It was shut down in May 2013 after its founder was arrested under suspicion of money laundering.  The full response letter from the Bitcoin Foundation is included below.

42397206,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXa0,1374248555,"Bitcoin gambler cheats SatoshiDice competitor Just-Dice out of 1,300 BTC","The owner of bitcoin betting site Just-Dice, a rival to SatoshiDice, had a severe moment of panic a few days ago when a user taking advantage of a human error caused him to lose 1,300 bitcoins (around $116,090 at the time of writing).  Known only as 'dooglus', the owner revealed on the Bitcoin Talk forum that he had made something of a colossal mistake. What happened was this: a player won a load of bitcoins on the site and asked to withdraw them, dooglus paid out, but forgot to remove the balance from the user's Just-Dice account. The user then gambled - and lost - the bitcoins that were left in his account and dooglus covered the loss out of his own pocket.  When he realised his mistake, dooglus contacted the user, who claimed he had left his laptop in a café and that someone else logged onto his Just-Dice account and gambled the money.  I'll leave it up to you to decide whether you believe that or not.  What has been most interesting about this whole mishap is the support given to dooglus by the community of Just-Dice users, with some pledging to donate all their future winnings to dooglus to get him back in the black.  ""The response from the Just-Dice community was so supportive. It was because of the community support and encouragement that I was able to turn this into a non-event. The community, at all times, seemed to have my best interests at heart and apart from a few 'trolls', the response was heartening,"" dooglus told CoinDesk.  The community helped him to realise that the 1,300 BTC the user lost should be thought of as fake bitcoins. When the user lost, those invested in the site or 'bankroll' thought they had gained 1,300 BTC, however, these coins were fake, so there was actually no gain to be made. With this in mind, dooglus simply rolled back the user's bets that were made with the 1,300 'fake' BTC and reclaimed the bitcoins that he paid out of his own pocket.  He said he feels he handled the incident poorly, but, regardless of this, very few people have since decided to leave the site.  ""Those who did leave voiced concerns regarding future challenges and my ability to deal with them. These concerns are being taken very seriously as I work to improve my abilities to better 'manage' the site. Overall, the site is still running with a high investment number, which points to continued faith in the idea of Just-Dice.""  Dooglus said the incident has taught him to automate as much as possible and take time when making decisions, considering carefully any actions that may affect the site.  The rise of Just-Dice  Just-Dice has become phenomenally popular since it went live on 20th June, with over 429,600 BTC ($38.4 million) being wagered in around 31 million bets.  ""To be honest, the huge surge took us by surprise. I think it is an innovative idea that hit the market at just the right time. People were tired of waiting for other sites to make promised improvements and changes, and were keen for something new,"" explained dooglus.  He said he created Just-Dice because he wanted to see a community-type site that allows people to be equal on many fronts, unlike other gambling sites. He had been playing around with the idea for over a year until he decided the time was right to get it out there.  Dooglus believes Just-Dice is different in many ways to other bitcoin betting sites, for example, it is off the block chain, gives instant results and large maximum profit per bet with a small house edge. It also offers the opportunity to invest instead of/as well as gamble.  ""People seem to enjoy the chat and camaraderie as well, and can watch others betting and cheer for or against the 'whales'.""  The real-time nature of the site makes it pretty darn addictive, you can see how much people are betting and how much they win or lose. The majority of users are just placing small bets here and there, but the whales do come along now and then to really steal the show. So far, the largest amount lost on one bet was a whopping 640 BTC and the biggest win was 303 BTC.  Security fears  When a new user visits the site for the first time, an account is automatically created. If that person has cookies enabled, they'll automatically be logged in each time they visit from the same computer and browser. If they want to log on using a different browser or computer, they can use a secret link, but this needs to be kept safe as it can be used to access their account balance.  This is similar to the system used by Instawallet, which is still in something of a pickle after hackers gained access to all of its users' hidden urls. Dooglus decided to use this system to make it easy for new users to test out the site, but recommends regular users take extra precautions.  ""We offer username/password sign ups and would recommend that anyone depositing take advantage of this. We also offer two-factor authentication via the Google Authenticator app for your smart phone,"" he explained.  What next?  A few days ago, the owner of Satoshi Dice announced the bitcoin betting site had been sold for 126,315 BTC (around $11.5 million). It's not yet known who the buyer is, but dooglus speculates they could be intending to try to compete directly with Just-Dice by adding similar features and options - off-block chain betting, for instance.  Dooglus said individuals asking to buy part of his site have approached him, but no individual or company has made a formal offer to acquire it. ""I've made it clear that I am not interested at this time,"" he explained.  So, what next for Just-Dice? Dooglus said a site redesign is currently in progress and he is working through a long list of suggestions from within the Just-Dice community.  There are a number of things he and his colleague 'Deb' want to change about the site, but their first and prevailing motivations are keeping users happy and keeping the community spirit alive.  What do you make of Just-Dice? Let us know in the comments below.

42397215,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXcx,1374224800,Trezor shield turns Raspberry Pi's into bitcoin wallets,"The team behind Trezorhas announced an accessory for the Raspberry Pi that will turn it into a, somewhat chunky, Trezor wallet. Trezor is a dongle-sized computer that can be used to hold private keys and sign transactions. The project is still in its early days and its developers have made it open source so that anyone can build their own implementation of a Trezor wallet.  The Raspberry Pi Shield is a circuit board that is added to the Raspberry Pi that presents the same interface as a Trezor wallet device. That is, two hardware keys and a small OLED screen. From the photos on the Trezor website, the Shield directly connects to the Raspberry Pi's general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins.  The Raspberry Pi has been popular with hobbyists and educators, as it is an extremely low cost computer (around £30) that provides complete access to its hardware. The bank of GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi circuit board are a way to directly access the system, rather than going through its USB ports, and this is how Trezor have effectively created a circuit board sandwich without a need for untidy USB cables.  Raspberry Pi comes without an operating system, and requires users to install an operating system, usually a Linux distribution, onto an SD card. Hobbyists and hackers hoping to make a Raspberry Pi Trezor wallet will need to pick a distribution (e.g. Raspbian) and then go on to install the Trezor software.  The problem with keeping your bitcoins on your computer is that your system may be infected by malware designed to steal your wallet. Trezor is made to be used with a desktop bitcoin client, it stores the private keys of your wallet, rather than having them stored on a PC.  When you start a bitcoin transaction on your desktop client, the details of that (unsigned) transaction are sent through to Trezor, which then signs the transaction with the private keys stored in its memory. Then the signed message is returned to your PC which then transmits that message onto the bitcoin network for mining nodes to confirm.  Of course, having a Raspberry Pi sized Trezor wallet will not be as comfortable or convenient as the embedded device that the company behind Trezor is producing. However, it is useful for enthusiasts, developers and hackers to try out.  Trezor described the Raspberry Pi shield to us as:  This is a board containing an OLED display, two buttons and a special chip which acts as a USB HID device. By itself the board is pretty useless but if you put it on a Raspberry Pi and run our software, you'll get a device that behaves exactly like TREZOR. Of course, it does not meet the physical security or comfort of the real product, but it's a great way for hackers or enthusiasts to learn how to develop TREZOR compatible applications (e.g. software wallets), understand how TREZOR works under the hood or to create custom applications. This board is aimed for casual hackers and tinkerers who have a Raspberry Pi computer and understand Linux and Python.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/19/trezor-shield-turns-raspberry-pis-into-bitcoin-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/117f82f56f8dc885551befafa1276f86549d9d3d-1024x563.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397203,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXY2,1374223002,Bitcoin buy-outs? Time to place your bets,"Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 19th July 2013 — a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law  Gambling would be enormous fun, were it not for the fact that you will lose. You’re free to think otherwise, but you don’t get many mathematicians in William Hill.  There is one exception to this otherwise golden rule, and that’s if you’re the bookie. Bookies make a lot of money from gambling, mostly by knowing more statistics than their punters do, but there are other ways. Take SatoshiDice, for example, which is an online bitcoin-only gambling establishment designed to take just under two percent of all bets placed - a nice rake-off, but not as nice as the 126k BTC that the site’s just been flogged for. That’s $11 million in the sort of currency that buys sandwiches.  Which isn’t bad for a site that’s been around for about a year and was traded on the Romanian bitcoin securities exchange - yes, Martha, there is such a thing. Admittedly, there are a few unknowns such as who bought it, but it looks like there are independent investors who’re getting a chunk of money out of it.    It is of course easy to wring hands and sigh deeply over the vices of mankind driving the technology, but despite the constant efforts of the deeply moral over thousands of years, the urge to spend extensively on the pursuit of cheap thrills remains one of the most basic forces for innovation. It may even be a good thing that it’s easy for motivated third parties to give bitcoin-focused businesses a decently skeptical going-over; scams, especially in the shadier regions, rely heavily on would-be investors not asking too many of the wrong sort of questions.    And asking a lot of questions before ponying up isn’t really gambling at all. It’s more, well, investing sensibly. A lot more of that would be no bad thing.  Java’s off. Fancy cocoa?    A long time ago in a venue far, far away (OK, New York, 1995) a much younger John Law experienced the first Java Day, where a brand-new language linked to a brand-new system called the World Wide Web was getting one of its first real airings.    It was terribly exciting. The language’s developer, Sun Microsystems, was one of the tech world’s star players, with the brightest brains and the hottest hardware. Java, it promised, would be ‘write once, run anywhere’; it didn’t care what computer it ran on, or where on the Internet it lived. Programmers could write one piece of software and have it appear with no further fuss, securely and swiftly, on anything that could be made Java-compatible. Which would be anything, really.    Eighteen years later, and Sun Microsystems is no more. Its battered corpse was swallowed by Oracle, which makes expensive databases for big companies, and a lot of Java’s potential has gone cold: the phrase “write once, crash anywhere” may yet outlive the original.    Which is a problem for programs that still need to slip easily across different sorts of computer, like bitcoin. Java is still pretty much the only game in town for that, as you can guarantee to find variants of it on Android phones, most online PCs and elsewhere, but its rather rickety reputation and industry politics has distanced it from the iPhone and iPad world.    Fortunately, as bitcoin is open source, gaps like this can be filled without having to wait for Apple itself to do the work, which is unlikely to happen before the heat death of the Universe. Instead, an independent group of developers has built the raw components of bitcoin for Cocoa (what is it with developers and hot drinks?), the standard way to put software on Apple products. That’s the beauty of open software: you don’t need to ask - or pay - for permission.      And so, if you’re smart and motivated, you can route around the problems of old or unloved software and build it yourself. And if you don’t know your stack from your pointers and are irredeemably lazy, you can just wait for someone else to do it. It’s also proof that, whatever happens in the future to our computers and mobile devices, bitcoin is ready to move with the times: another sign that it’s here to stay.    Art for art’s sake, bitcoins for god’s sake    John Law was very pleased to note the Financial Times opinion on the similarities of the bitcoin and the art markets. Which, indeed, the paper described as “the sophisticated man’s bitcoin”.      Stepping smartly over the insinuation that those engaged in cryptocurrency are unsophisticated - ipse dixit, eh, readers? - it is amusing to follow the comparisons that the FT drew. There is little relation between any sort of quantifiable worth and the actual valuation of art, and the market resists such discovery through being run by a cabal of experts, collectors, writers and pundits. Also, most of the stuff isn’t looked at very much, which you might suppose art should be. Instead, it sits around in secretive vaults, stored and traded away from the prying eyes of the taxman and other sundry suits.      Well, yes, you could say all that about bitcoin, although John Law considers the differences to be far more significant - try buying and selling art on your mobile to people you’ve never met, with no human intermediaries running the market.      Yet the germ of an idea has taken hold. If art and bitcoin are such similar beasts, then what would their offspring be like? Last week, the first part of the interview with developer Jeff Garzik covered coloured coins, the ability to attach data such as images to digital currency (the second part is just as interesting and now online). This led, of course, to the realisation that kittens would be the secret power behind ultimate domination.      But the ability to link unique artwork with bitcoin goes beyond that. Imagine the interest if Banksy, say, started spewing forth BTC with unique anti-capitalism graphics attached. Or some hip young street muso put out a hundred copies of their latest banging dubstep-skiffle mashup, attached to individual coins. You could of course make copies of the pictures or the music because that’s what the Internet does and there’s no stopping it. But only the originals would be authenticated by the BTC mechanism.      Authenticity, of course, is the gold standard of the art world - and of cybercurrency. It is the entire value of the proposition, and ever more so in the digital world of perfect copying and instantaneous transmission. The underlying mechanisms of bitcoin are all about generating unique objects and guaranteeing their uniqueness while enabling a near-perfect market mechanism for transferring them. It would seem a perfect match to art, and might even democratise what is by any measure a profoundly opaque and controlled market.      As the FT and others have noted, there’s a good track record in coupling cash to creativity - and canny exploitation. John Law has no problem whatsoever in predicting that the first artwork involving BTC will see the light of day before this time next year.    Anyone fancy a wager?  John Law  is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude. He has returned to write for CoinDesk on the foibles of digital currency.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,John Law,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/19/bitcoin-buy-outs-time-to-place-your-bets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f831a6ed156e7cae622a8302561bd9bbc0650ff-779x559.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
