42397266,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4YR,1380132680,What it's actually like to get paid exclusively in bitcoins,"When I first started writing for CoinDesk, all my friends made the same joke: you aren't going to get paid in bitcoins, are you?  I assured all concerned parties that I would work for nothing but US dollars. I made sure to get that in writing.  But the more I learn about bitcoin, the more I realize that getting paid in the cryptocurrency would not be as scary as I feared.  There aren't many people in the world right now who collect all or part of their regular salary in bitcoins, but those who do overwhelmingly report being satisfied with the set-up.  Of course, they're a self-selected group - most of them work for bitcoin-related organizations. Still, it's interesting to learn how little inconvenience and uncertainty is being reported by the select few who collect their pay in bitcoins.  Bitcoin earners handle their digital paychecks in different ways. One method is the ""immediate cash-out,"" practiced by Lindsay Holland, assistant director of the Bitcoin Foundation. Like all the foundation's employees, Holland receives her entire salary in the currency.  ""I hold a certain percent of my bitcoin and sell the rest. I try to do that on a regular basis,"" Holland said.  The portion she holds is part of her investment portfolio. Regular cash-outs help protect Holland's spending money from fluctuations in the price of bitcoin, while the part that she saves gives her the opportunity to benefit from the long-term growth in value that enthusiasts hope to see.  Other employees strive to spend as much as their salary as possible in its original bitcoin state. San Francisco bitcoin wallet company CoinBase pays all six of its employees entirely in bitcoins, and employee Olaf Carlson-Wee says: ""I try to stay within the bitcoin economy as much as possible.""  That means paying his rent in bitcoins. He rents a bedroom in a fellow bitcoin enthusiast's apartment, and the rent is a fixed dollar amount, paid in bitcoins at the current exchange rate. Other ways he spends his salary include online shopping from sites that take bitcoins and reimbursing friends for dinners out.  ""I'll usually have one of them pay for my portion of the meal with a credit card or cash, and I'll send them bitcoin. I've got them all set up with it,"" Carlson-Wee said.  When workers get paid in bitcoins, sometimes businesses in the neighborhood start accepting the currency.  John Stahl, communications assistant at the Bitcoin Foundation, recently convinced a Seattle food truck he frequents to sign up with a bitcoin processing service.  ""I look forward to when I can pay for my grilled cheese with bitcoin there,"" Stahl said.  In San Francisco's Richmond District, the same effect led a Japanese restaurant to begin accepting bitcoins. In April, about one third of the employees of The Internet Archive, the non-profit digital library, began taking some of their pay in bitcoins.  Soon Internet Archive employees had talked the management of Sake Zone, which is very near their office, into accepting bitcoin for lunch. The Archive even set up a wi-fi repeater to get the restaurant the Internet connection it needed to make online bitcoin transactions, said founder Brewster Kahle.  For the Internet Archive, paying staff in bitcoins was a way to use some of the 922 bitcoin donations the organization has received since 2011 in a manner consistent with the spirit of the donations.  ""I think of bitcoin as the local currency of the Internet. As a local curency it reinforces the community we're trying to build,"" Kahle said.  Internet Archive employees also have the option of changing some of their bitcoins for dollars on the spot in an honor box that Kahle maintains in the office. It's just a cash box and a computer; employees can deposit bitcoins into a digital wallet and help themselves to dollars, or vice versa.  For employers, paying salaries in bitcoins takes some figuring out. All the organizations who pay in bitcoins set their workers' salaries in dollars, so that the dollar amount they get each pay period does not fluctuate with the price of bitcoin.  It's also important for companies to record the dollar value of the bitcoins paid, so they can accurately calculate social security, taxes and other withholdings.  Employees who get paid in bitcoins need to give some extra thought to their own tax reporting as well. Most of the employees in this story have been paid in bitcoins for less than a year, and have not yet filed their tax returns on bitcoin pay periods. But Holland, of the Bitcoin Foundation, was paid in bitcoins in 2012, so she's been through the process already.  While reporting her salary based on the dollar value at the time she was paid is relatively straightforward, things can get more complicated when the bitcoin value changes before bitcoins are traded for dollars.  ""If I received my bitcoin on September 1 and it's worth $10, but then I sell it at $20, the initial $10 is (subject to) payroll tax, but then the additional $10 would be considered a capital gain, from the advice that I received,"" Holland said.  Careful record keeping is necessary to allow her to accurately report gains or losses from all the trades she does throughout the year.  One thing that employers and employees I spoke with agree on is that they must pay taxes on the bitcoin salaries. The companies issue W2 forms and report the salaries paid to the government as they normally would.  The US Internal Revenue Service has not said much about bitcoin, but a recent General Accounting Office report states that people who record bitcoin gains probably owe taxes.  When friends first warned me to make sure not to accept bitcoins as pay, I imagined myself accepting a payment, then checking back the next day to find that my funds were worth nearly nothing in dollars.  Some of the bitcoin-paid employees I spoke with have been through large fluctuations in the bitcoin/dollar exchange rate - and yet all of them said they had never found themselves in dire financial straits due to a loss in their digital paycheck's value.  Carlson-Wee, who keeps most of his savings in bitcoins aside from a small USD reserve, admits that a personal financial emergency could put him in the position of having to sell off a lot of his bitcoins at a low price.  “I don't think most financial planners would recommend this risk level,"" he said. But he figures that at his age - 24 -he can afford the risk in the name of literally putting his money where his mouth is.  ""I make and lose a thousand dollars on a regular basis due to the price fluctuations,"" he said. ""For me, it's more fun than scary.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/25/what-its-actually-like-to-get-paid-exclusively-in-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/778af21b4ba2a3081490b9814c37bcd968232854-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397254,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao4Nc,1380108356,Armory and the monetization of bitcoin wallets,"A group of prominent investors recently made a play in the bitcoin wallet space by backing startup Armory Technologies, Inc. The $600,000 seed round investment will go mostly towards funding and expanding development.  Interestingly, this placement brings into focus a much larger issue: the monetization of bitcoin wallets.  It's no mistake that Armory founder and CEO Alan Reiner told CoinDesk: ""This first 12 months is more about developing a quality product than it is figuring out how to monetize it."" An effective wallet monetization strategy doesn't exist yet.  Even lead investor Trace Mayer agrees. Wallets being in dire need of improvement is ""actually very problematic and a tragedy of the commons problem which I fear will likely only get worse because it is so difficult to monetize wallets,"" he wrote. Mayer also said: ""There is no immediate plan for how to monetize Armory.""  Indeed, wallet development may get funded, but revenue and profitability are different issues. Here is how I see this market playing out.  It may be comforting to wallet investors that open source Mozilla Firefox has 18.29% worldwide market share of the free browser market, but receives $300 million per year from a Google search deal. Similarly, eyeballs from bitcoin wallets could steer exchange choices but that's in the long term.  Armory is an open source bitcoin wallet with a strong reputation for security and it is considered a 'thick client', meaning that downloading the entire block chain is required to verify transactions.  For low overhead and faster mobile applications, future releases will support a spectrum of block chain access options and the desktop-to-mobile interaction will be important.  Just as with web browsers, the client front-end (or wallet) is part of a grander play in the space. With the online wallets of traditional payment methods, the grander play for transactional and value-add revenue is currently being executed by the technology giants, telecoms, and banks.  But what's the main driver for bitcoin wallets and payments, especially given that tech brands like Apple may actively be blocking certain bitcoin features for their own strategic benefit?  The answer lies with the bitcoin service providers. Today's hosted wallet services, merchant processors, and integrated exchanges offer the best near-term choice for wallet monetization, but it will most likely involve a third party and a mobile app.  Bitcoin exchanges already experience a good portion of their customer base using the exchange as an online wallet of sorts. As the bitcoin economy matures, service providers will be searching for unique differentiators to gain a competitive advantage.  Either the service providers evolve into turbo-charged, sophisticated wallets or the bitcoin wallets themselves emerge as premier service providers as seen with the Send Shared mixing service from Blockchain's My Wallet.  Since it's a convergence either way, the future of wallets probably includes a combination of both approaches. Armory's management team has a tabula rasa business model in front of them now and they will no doubt be presented with several promising opportunities to build or partner. So let's focus instead on the evolution of the third-party service providers becoming sophisticated wallets.  For corporate security reasons, there's probably a place for desktop wallets in the future, but the majority of innovation will be in the web-based and mobile wallets.  Hybrid wallets  , where the user maintains the private keys, and hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets offer two of the most promising areas for development.  To see where all of this is headed, just look at the feature set of the Blockchain Android App for My Wallet and that doesn't even include P2SH and split key support.  Take Coinbase for example. The company operates a hosted bitcoin wallet with two-way exchange capabilities and it smartly realizes that consumers are also merchants, and vice versa.  A Coinbase-Armory mobile wallet app could broaden out the Coinbase offering by allowing customers more direct control over their coins using different hosted wallet scenarios. Their primary downside right now is that they only provide a domestic exchange service for the US.  LocalBitcoins  is a decentralized approach to trading bitcoin because it matches buyers and sellers in various local regions for trade clearing and settlement.  Sellers maintaining bitcoin balances on the LocalBitcoins wallet is the preferred way to operate. With greater functionality, the site could easily evolve into a primary hosted wallet service in its own right. The company is already offering support for multi-currency and has a global following.  Not wanting to get left behind, exchanges like Mt. Gox and Bitstamp could see themselves adding robust and mobile wallet features that are quite separate from the exchange business.  In addition to exchanges expanding into the wallet space, the merchant processing operators like BitPay and BIPS both benefit from increased functionality at the wallet level.  As more bitcoin balances are kept by the merchants rather than exchanged out to national currencies, the merchant processors start to resemble a hosted wallet because the exchange services become less important. The online secure access and management reporting capabilities of the wallet become the wedge for competitive differentiation.  Going outside of the bitcoin ecosystem, it's easy to imagine commercial banks and portfolio managers offering specialized bitcoin custodial services to their client base, including branded hardware wallets. When the online casino world goes full bitcoin, the wallet integration issues will be front and center. All present excellent revenue opportunities for leading wallet vendors, not excluding transaction-based revenue.  As new companies and new business initiatives enter the bitcoin market, they will look to the well-known wallets.  Established wallet leaders with reputable brands and diverse offerings will be able to leverage that into a service-oriented model. With integration, maintenance, and even hosting potential, the superior bitcoin wallets like Armory have a bright future.
