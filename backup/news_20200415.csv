Announced Wednesday, Solana is partnering with Terra, the stablecoin initiated by one of South Korea's e-commerce giants, TMON, as a way to cut credit card transaction fees out of retail profit margins.      ""By bringing stablecoins onto our network, we aim to dramatically expand the design space for developers, opening the door to novel applications that require price-stable payments,"" the Solana team wrote in a draft blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance. ""It's our hope by prioritizing support for stablecoins with Terra that we can accelerate the DeFi ecosystem within Solana.""      Despite skepticism when they were new, stablecoins have proven to be one of the fastest-growing sectors of the cryptocurrency industry, though questions persist about the business model in an environment of negligible interest rates following COVID-19.      Terra, built on Tendermint, the technology underpinning interoperability project Cosmos, is eyeing bridges like the one with Solana as part of its growth strategy.      The Terra team wrote: ""As we continue to grow, we expect demand to expand into new regions and new blockchain ecosystems beyond our own. Anticipating this, we recognize the priority of building bridges and relationships to grow the reach of Terra’s stablecoins within the Solana ecosystem.""      The Solana project is quite new. Though its white paper came out in 2017, it only went live late last year, following a Series A round led by Multicoin Capital in July 2019. Solana has since been looking for partnerships to expand its reach.      Terra is one of many payment providers available to e-commerce users in South Korea, primarily through its payment app, Chai. In a blog post, Terra said it recently crossed 1 million daily active users and $3 million in daily transaction volume.      The advantage to vendors using Chai is that payment fees amount to only 0.5 percent, much less than typical credit card fees. Nevertheless, one knowledgeable source in Korea told CoinDesk that Chai still does not have nearly the user base of legacy payment platforms in the country.      Binance led a $32 million round backing Terra in 2018. Solana recently completed a token auction on CoinList on March 24 and was listed on Binance.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | SOL | TECHNOLOGY,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/15/solana-blockchain-adds-korean-stablecoin-terra-for-better-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a930c00e480b6373c00c99d96777fcd9facfe168-1900x1267.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431740,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5uLh,1586986806,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Price Volatility Declines in Contrast to S&P 500,"You know things are weird when bitcoin is getting less volatile and stocks aren’t.       After surging about a month ago during a frantic sell-off, the 30-day volatility of daily returns from the leading cryptocurrency has dropped in recent days, and is almost back to where it was before the panic started in early March.      Meanwhile, the volatility of the S&P 500 index of large U.S. stocks, which also skyrocketed in March as the coronavirus paralyzed the world’s economies, has plateaued.      What’s causing the S&P to continue its volatility run while even bitcoin is returning to its version of normal? The mixed performance of various stocks within the bellwether index is part of a problem.      “The interesting game now is not S&P 500, but some of the top stocks inside. Just check Tesla and Amazon, they are moving much better than S&P on average,” said Maksim Balashevich CEO of Santiment, a firm that analyzes market data.      To be clear, over the long term bitcoin remains the more volatile investment by a wide margin. And risk assets of all stripes remain subject to wilder swings than usual.      Read more: Chainlink’s Link Token Outperforms Bitcoin as Business Wins Fuel Hype Cycle      “Investors are generally looking for stability and volatile assets will be sold no matter what they are,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto investment brokerage Bequant, regarding the S&P 500’s fraught performance.      Balashevich noted that an index like the S&P 500 doesn’t account for the divergent fortunes of different sectors in a pandemic, where leisure stocks perform badly but online retailers make gains. Crypto beats such a blunt instrument in this environment, he argued.      “I would bet for BTC and ETH,” he said. The S&P 500 will keep struggling as the economy is in a split.”    Today’s price action    Prices for bitcoin (BTC) slipped 1 percent in 24 hour trading Wednesday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Trading for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency has dipped below its 50-day moving average on spot exchanges like Coinbase. The price for 1 BTC has been attempting to break back above its 10-day moving average but has been stuck in the $6,700 range for the past eight hours of trading as of 21:00 UTC (5:00 p.m. EDT) April 15.       Recent data suggest that many investors are holding onto bitcoin rather than participating as active sellers in the market. Over-the-counter (OTC) trading activity can be an indicator of this as well.      “I do get much less sellers contacting me now, so a jump to maybe $7,500 or $8,000 would give a push to the OTC market in bitcoin,” said Henrik Kugelberg,” a Sweden-based crypto OTC trader.      An influx of stablecoin activity could provide a boost, as often issuance in that market translates into purchases of free-floating assets such as bitcoin and ether, creating price bumps.       Other analysts see pessimistic signals amid a return to calmer markets since March’s steep dip in prices to below $4,000 at one point.      “Starting to feel a bit more bearish given we failed around the $7,200 level, likely to test $6,500 in the next day or so,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.      “If it fails we’ll likely squeeze lower off the back of Asian volumes, which I think people will use as an opportunity to get into the market,” he added. The Nikkei 225 stock index, an indicator for Asia, fell by less than a percent Wednesday, its first time in the red this week as major gains in transportation offset selling in other sectors.    Other markets    Most major digital assets are mixed on CoinDesk’s big board for the day. Ether (ETH) dipped less than 1 percent. Big losers include iota (IOTA) in the red at 2.9 percent and litecoin (LTC) losing 1.7 percent. One asset flashing green is lisk (LSK) up 4 percent All price changes are from 21:15 UTC (5:15 p.m. EDT) Tuesday.

Gold has beensoundly beating bitcoin’s performance this year, up double digit percentage points since the start of 2020 whereas bitcoin is down 5 percent on the year.       The FTSE 100 index ended Wednesday down 2.9 percent with weak oil demand is affecting companies like BP and Shell in the European markets.      The S&P 500 index of large U.S. stocks slipped 2.2 percent as the Federal Reserve’s beige book analysis of economic activity noted sharp contraction Wednesday.      Also notable is that U.S. Treasury bonds experienced selling Wednesday, with two-year, ten-year and thirty-year yields all down sharply.

42431735,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5uFh,1586975377,Chainlink's Link Token Outperforms Bitcoin as Business Wins Fuel Hype Cycle,"Chainlink’s link token is outperforming bitcoin by leaps and bounds as the oracle network’s various use cases garners investor attention, leading to a self-feeding bullish cycle.       Link rose by 31 percent in the first quarter and was trading near $3.20 at press time, representing a 42 percent month-to-date (MTD) increase, according to data source Messari.       The cryptocurrency was registering a bigger MTD price gain of 62 percent over the weekend, when it was trading at a one-month high of $3.66.       While the 14th largest cryptocurrency is extending its Q1 ascent, bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency, has eked out just 5 percent gains so far this month, having shed 10 percent of its value in the first quarter.       This being the cryptocurrency market, hype has played a role in the run-up.       ""Link has a strong fan base that constantly promotes or ‘shills’ the project to potential buyers. This often creates a positive reinforcement cycle, further driving up the price,"" Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data, told CoinDesk.      See also: More Investors Are Holding Bitcoin Ahead of the Halving, Data Suggests      But recently Chainlink has given those promoters something to talk about: its association with a new project called the Baseline Protocol and partnerships in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, which have generated hype for the project.    Enterprise applications    Chainlink is a system of oracles built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. An oracle is a third-party information source that supplies data to blockchains. If someone buys insurance against an earthquake or hurricane, for example, an oracle would tell the smart contract when such a disaster occurs so it can pay the policyholder. The link token, in turn, is used to pay Chainlink node operators for providing these services.       The Baseline Protocol, formed by EY and Consensys in collaboration with Microsoft in March, is an open source initiative that combines advances in blockchain, cryptography and messaging with the goal of delivering secure and private business processes at low cost through the public Ethereum mainnet.       Chainlink joined forces with the founders in developing the eponymous baseline protocol.      See also: Inside China’s Plan to Power Global Blockchain Adoption      “People are incredibly excited for Chainlink to help usher in an era of mainnet enterprise applications as a part of initiatives like the Baseline Protocol,” said Vance Spencer, co-founder of technology company Framework Ventures, which is one of the largest private holders of LINK tokens.       Some observers think Chainlink would serve best in such baseline protocols as a facilitator or oracle for all moving parts in the new business network and could continue to benefit from the ongoing shift in focus from base layer chains to the middleware services that provide security for data feeds.       “The boundaries between classically defined smart contracts and oracles have started to dissolve,” Spencer said. “This has reframed narratives surrounding smart contracts, pushing expectations of trustlessness and, therefore, valuation from base layer blockchains to the oracles that service them. Chainlink is by far the best of breed approach, team and product in a space that we increasingly see as winner-take-all.”     Dominating DeFi    The DeFi industry turned to Chainlink, which draws asset prices from multiple sources to inform smart contracts, after multiple hacks on lending platform bZx in February exposed risks arising from using a single source for such data.       “Link has gained some notoriety due to the protocol's variety of use cases, particularly their decentralized price reference data feeds, which are used by various DeFi protocols such as Synthetix and bZx,” Abendschein said.       bZx attackers were able to manipulate asset prices and make sizable money mainly because the platform used Kyber Network as a single oracle, or supplier of asset prices.       An attacker's job becomes difficult with the use of multiple price inputs as manipulation on one platform does not meaningfully affect the end result of the transaction.       See also: Morgan Creek Invests in Startup Bringing Bitcoin to DeFi      Lending platforms bZx, Aave, Celsuis network and Synthetix have partnered with Chainlink for secure oracle solutions.       Chainlink claims its decentralized oracle network can vastly expand the functionality of DeFi smart contracts, increase the variety of products offered, and make the market more enticing for regulated players to participate within. If that proves true, the cryptocurrency could continue to outperform bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies.       That said, bitcoin is still an anchor for the cryptocurrency markets. As a result, a sell-off in bitcoin, if any, would likely derail Link’s bullish move.",POSITIVE,LINK,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | LINK | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/15/chainlinks-link-token-outperforms-bitcoin-as-business-wins-fuel-hype-cycle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a14477fb58c8698bda208a847a42fb006ca19637-2560x1651.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

He wants the federal government to continue paying out $2,000 monthly checks until the crisis is well and truly over.      The ex-presidential contender, basic income advocate and crypto community favorite thinks the pandemic is too bleak to be worrying overly about the national debt.      “When the house is on fire, you don't worry that much about the water you're using to put it out,” he said as part of a web chat with Axios. “We have the equivalent of a $21 trillion fire on our hands, and we have to do everything we can to help people get through this.”      See also: CoinDesk's ""Most Influential"" profile of Andrew Yang      Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Rep Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) and Rep Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) introduced legislation Tuesday to deliver $,2000 monthly payments until employment returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. Khanna represents California's 17th Congressional District, which is located in the heart of Silicon Valley.      The payments would cost billions of dollars but, when asked if this was too expensive, Yang dismissed the idea that cost should be at the forefront of considerations right now.      “We have mass graves and people doing really heartbreaking things to try and keep themselves safe, but [it] can get even worse if you have people literally facing mass deprivation,” said Yang. “And they're not sure how they're even going to put food on the table. So this, to me, is a necessary investment in the preservation of our economy and society.”      Yang added there are dozens of legislators who are going to be pushing forward a plan like the one he’s proposing, and he’s in touch with members of Congress, Democratic Party presidential contender Joe Biden’s team and others who are going to be “pushing forward a plan that's essentially identical to what I'm championing right here.”      See also: Yang 2020 and the Search for the Next Crypto Candidate      Asked specifically if Biden would back this plan, Yang demurred, saying Biden, the former U.S. vice president, was a very smart, practical leader who k""nows we need to do everything we can to provide for people"" in a time of crisis.      The Biden campaign has not responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.      Ryan's and Khanna’s Emergency Money for the People Act pushes for more sustained direct cash payments to American adults. Every American adult age 16 and older earning less than $130,000 annually would receive at least $2,000 per month as part of the bill.      “A one-time, $1,200 check isn’t going to cut it,” said Khanna in a statement. “Americans need sustained cash infusions for the duration of this crisis in order to come out on the other side alive, healthy and ready to get back to work. Members on both sides of the aisle are finally coming together around the idea of sending money out to people. Rep. Ryan and I are urging leadership to include this bill in the fourth COVID relief package to truly support the American working class.”      The coronavirus crisis has spurred what could be considered the first federal universal basic income experiment in the U.S., but whether it's only a one-time payment remains to be seen.",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/15/andrew-yang-says-current-stimulus-payments-to-americans-arent-enough,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eed908a6bfe012d1fbfc584ce8ae0c3132a71d11-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Pointing to a laundry list of cyber assaults allegedly initiated by North Korean state actors, the U.S. departments of State, Treasury and Homeland Security plus the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) argued that cutting the Hermit Kingdom’s money flow – said to be billions of dollars raised over the past two years including $1.5 billion in crypto – is vital to stopping the rogue regime’s development of weapons of mass destruction.      “We strongly urge governments, industry, civil society and individuals to take all relevant actions” to stop future attacks from occurring, the agencies said. This includes implementing tough anti-money-laundering frameworks for digital currency, expelling North Korean IT workers, following best cyber practices, and communicating with law enforcement.      Together, these steps could help mitigate a threat the U.S. government is calling “Hidden Cobra.” The crypto focus of this criminal pattern of activity dates back to at least May 2017, when the WannaCry ransomware attack infected hundreds of thousands of computers and demanded bitcoin as ransom. World governments have blamed North Koreans for the hack.      Since then, the U.S. agencies assert, Hidden Cobra's perpetrators have mounted increasingly sophisticated and diverse cyber campaigns – including multiple plots entirely dependent on digital currency. Cryptojacking has collectively raised $25,000 in monero and money laundering has washed hundreds of millions in stolen exchange funds that would otherwise have fallen under sanctions.      Those campaigns are only expected to rise in prominence. The country is expected to boost its monero activities in 2020 and its $1.5 billion crypto money laundering network is also believed to be ongoing.      “The DPRK also uses cyber capabilities to steal from financial institutions, and has demonstrated a pattern of disruptive and harmful cyber activity that is wholly inconsistent” with international cyberspace norms, according to the U.S. agencies.      U.S officials have maintained a zero-tolerance policy for even the appearance of assisting the North’s crypto operations. Virgil Griffith, an Ethereum developer, was indicted in early 2020 for attending a North Korean crypto conference where he is accused of describing how blockchain systems can be used to evade sanctions.      North Korea has strongly denied allegations of stealing up to $2 billion dollars in fiat and crypto, calling the accusations “nothing but a sort of a nasty game.” The rest of the world disagrees.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | XMR,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/15/us-agencies-publish-list-of-north-koreas-alleged-crypto-crimes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b36eaee522ac5599be5fe7719210d61ffa264ca-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431731,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5u5h,1586971180,"3D Printing Could Help Now, Except for the IP Issues","Cathy Barrera, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist at Prysm Group, an economic advisory group, and was chief economist at ZipRecruiter. She has a PhD in business economics from Harvard.    From Italian startups to local school districtshttps://norfolkdailynews.com/wjag/news/ricketts-praises-northeast-neb-schools-for-d-printing-personal-protective/article_06e7efcc-706c-11ea-9a03-3f254c914933.html, many groups have adopted 3D printing technologies to fill the urgent global need for ventilator components and personal protective equipment (PPE). In times of crisis, the gap between supply and demand grows and becomes more apparent. 3D printing is a perfect solution to address these issues.    Currently, these critical shortfalls are being addressed in an ad hoc manner. This is inefficient and wrong. Instead, the U.S. needs robust 3D printing production capabilities nationwide so we can seamlessly increase the availability of needed supplies. Although it is clearly impossible for this to occur during this current pandemic, such capabilities should be developed before the next crisis hits. While prior efforts – including an initiative by President Obama – have stalled, we now have the tools and resources needed to accomplish this task. The remaining challenge to achieving this goal is economic rather than technical in nature. Crucially, blockchain will play a key role in overcoming that challenge.      See also: Open Source PPE: Decentralizing Face Mask Production      One way to prepare for these acute crisis-induced problems is to create stockpiles. But as we have seen (and our health care workers have experienced firsthand), stockpiles can fail due to the non-durability of essential supplies. Another plausible path is to satisfy demand for some types of supplies through 3D printing.      3D printing technology has three primary characteristics that make it perfect for addressing an unexpected mismatch between supply and demand.    Digital property rights need to be addressed to support increased usage of 3D printing production.    First, relative to traditional manufacturing techniques, 3D printing is more flexible. The same machine without any reconfiguration can be used to produce (almost) whatever is needed, as long as there is access to the proper raw materials and designs. Second, with 3D printing, production can be located close to where the goods will be used. This reduces transportation costs and allows for production decisions to be made based on local needs. Finally, 3D printed goods can be produced on demand and used almost immediately. While the actual production times vary, eliminating reconfiguration and transportation times makes the overall speed to addressing a shortage is faster.      Even though these benefits exist, 3D printing is only a ~$12.1 billion industry, representing 0.90 percent of United States durable goods GDP (0.06 percent of United States total GDP). It has largely failed to deliver on its promise of enabling at-home manufacturing. But lack of adoption can hardly be blamed on technical issues anymore. The production capabilities of 3D printers have improved greatly in the last 10 years. Currently, the best 3D printers can use more than 250 different raw materials, are 100 times faster than previous 3D printers and can achieve 90 percent material efficiency. Instead, the barriers to achieving a robust market of 3D printed goods are economic in nature.    IP headaches    The main challenge to enabling large scale 3D printing manufacturing – particularly with remote production – is protecting the property rights of those creating product designs.      Digital goods are notoriously difficult to protect. For example, in the late 1990s/early 2000s, the digitization of music and the power of the internet enabled millions of copies of songs to be pirated (e.g., Napster). Similar issues have arisen for digitized movies and books. If rights to 3D printing designs can’t be protected, there is not enough of an incentive for suppliers to distribute innovative, socially useful designs.      This problem has been tackled before through digital rights management (DRM) schemes. The recurring issue with these schemes was that each relied on a single intermediary to enforce the property rights. This single intermediary is problematic for both buyers and sellers on a platform, who are all dependent on that intermediary’s continued support. Apple’s iTunes DRM is one famous example. Apple successfully defended itself against a lawsuit claiming it was using its DRM to exclude competing music sellers from the iPod. Apple argued the updates that resulted in competitors being locked out were needed in order to meaningfully improve the media player software.      See also: Europe Debates COVID-19 Contact Tracing That Respects Privacy      Blockchain shows promise as a technology that can manage property rights without an intermediary. In contrast to the DRM solutions that have been attempted in the past, a decentralized, ledger-based system would more easily allow honest users to access the same content across various platforms and formats. While it isn’t a DRM panacea, in combination with encryption a distributed ledger that records each content purchase and transfer will likely make it easier to detect and assign blame for copyright violation. Even if a blockchain can’t fully eliminate piracy for 3D printing designs, a technologically and economically well-designed, blockchain-based platform would raise the costs required to get around DRM, making it more attractive to many 3D printing manufacturers to simply pay for the designs.      Digital property rights need to be addressed to support increased usage of 3D printing production. With enforceable property rights, together with well-designed contracts and proper two-sided marketplace design, buyers can trust sellers and sellers can be properly incentivized to participate in the digital marketplace. Once these economic challenges are surmounted, we will be able to build out our 3D printing capabilities for use during “normal” times. The flexibility, locality and timeliness that 3D printing enables in our most vital supply chains will leave us well prepared for the next big crisis.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Cathy Barrera,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/15/3d-printing-could-help-now-except-for-the-ip-issues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49acbf2786535f113d3065d877743dafb8e0d114-1800x1097.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431734,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5uDh,1586968200,HODLpac Shows Crypto Is Becoming a Mainstream Industry,"James Cooper is a professor of law at California Western School of Law in San Diego. For more than two decades, he has advised governments, international institutions, not for profit organizations, and corporations on the regulation of disruptive technologies and legal sector innovations.      On March 23, 2020, a new political action committee for the cryptocurrency world was launched in the United States. Designed to provide clarity as well as legitimacy for fintech, HODLpac is an important step towards the maturation of the industry. It is about time that crypto entrepreneurs, investors, and promoters put on their big boy pants, play in the regulatory sharktank of Washington D.C., rid themselves of the challenges that come with cryptocurrency’s history of fraud, and truly lead the advent of internet 3.0.      The fintech industry has been saddled with the reputation of being a haven for scamsters to steal from Mom and Pop investors and a mechanism by which Eastern European mobsters, Latin American narco traffickers, Asian gangsters, and other no goodniks launder their money. The crazy heights of cryptocurrency prices in late-2017 and early-2018 saw a rash of ICOs with unthought through and straight-out copied and pasted white papers take over fintech as stupid money piled on. By May 2018, the Wall Street Journal published a front-page article that studied 1450 ICO projects, 271 of which were deemed fraudulent. The real shocker was that the number was not even higher.      See also: HODLpac Enlists Winklevoss Twins, Brian Armstrong in Bid to Influence Crypto Policy in Washington      It has been a long climb back towards probity and decency. The HODLpac should help light the way back. This is a fundamental move for crypto promoters from a libertarian, cypherpunk, anarchistic ethos towards legitimacy, even convention. It is being done in a disruptive way: When individuals donate to HODLpac, they receive an equivalent number of “votes.” HODLpac plans to use quadratic voting, a system by which a group of people can choose a collective good for themselves. In essence, people can buy votes for or against a specific proposal by paying into a fund the square of the number of votes that they buy. In the context of a political action committee, a donor chooses multiple recipients but each subsequent recipient receives a smaller share of that donor’s vote. This process allows donors to express the degree of their preference and not just simply to direct where their respective funds go. Quadratic voting can ensure that individuals who donate larger amounts do not have an exaggerated influence on the destination of the donated funds.      Notwithstanding this approach, there is a plethora of ironies that comes with a political action committee for the cryptocurrency industry. It is super odd that HODLpac is taking advantage of centralization to argue for decentralization. Lobbying is a very centralized system; Congress is a centralized system of governance. To register as a political action committee is a centralized process as there is one depository and a set of regulatory hoops the PAC must jump through.      This burgeoning political action committee recognizes that the U.S. government is not acting proactively on the cryptocurrency front, nor do our governing authorities fully understand the power of distributed ledger technology or digital assets. The PAC wants to leverage grassroots participation and be decentralized in its operations. It will create a scorecard that ranks members of Congress in their respective support for digital assets – a lot like the National Rifle Association does for gun-related legislation.      The PAC will also direct funds to different congressional candidates, just like other political action committees. There needs to be more proactive and thoughtful policy making in the fintech space. HODLpac is also important because there is much education to be done. There is a public education aspect to it which is critical because few members of Congress understand this burgeoning industry. It is unlikely that any U.S. legislator can explain a “smart contract,” never mind a “decentralized cryptographic ledger”.    There is a plethora of ironies that comes with a political action committee for the cryptocurrency industry.    A few members of Congress get it already and have made some early attempts at legislation. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), introduced the Token Taxonomy Act in 2018, updating it in April 2019. The Crypto-Currency Act 2020 was introduced on March 9 by Representative Matt Gosar, Republican of Arizona. Early versions of the massive bailout legislation to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic included some forms of a digital dollar to quicken the government aid to the non-banked. Although such a novel approach did not make it into the final act, it speaks to the eventuality of a dollar-backed digital currency.      HODLpac might not be the first group out there to fashion legislation for the cryptocurrency industry, but it could become a very important player as we emerge from the current crypto winter. If the United States is to become the true global leader in the fintech industry, HODLpac and other blockchain friendly lobbyists will be necessary. It will only be a matter of months until the Chinese Digital Currency/Electronic Payment initiative, a RMB-backed digital currency, and the Blockchain-based Service Network, a network that will serve many more Chinese cities, are deployed. We should not be playing catch up.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,James Cooper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/15/hodlpac-shows-crypto-is-becoming-a-mainstream-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3feaa8d26221e92410d9acafb2f8bf7321e4dc45-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431722,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5tph,1586960738,Morgan Creek Invests in Startup Bringing Bitcoin to DeFi,"Bitcoin advocate Anthony ""Pomp"" Pompliano is betting the top cryptocurrency might have more of a role to play in the emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) space.      Pompliano's Morgan Creek Digital was one of the investors in a $2.45 million seed round for Atomic Loans, a Canadian startup looking to create bitcoin-backed lending instruments.      Announced Wednesday, the seed round was led by Initialized Capital – an investor in Coinbase – with participation also coming from the founders of blockchain protocol provider Bison Trails and ConsenSys, a prominent financial backer in the ethereum ecosystem. ConsenSys previously invested in the startup's pre-seed round in 2019.      The idea behind Atomic Loans is to allow bitcoin holders to leverage the dollar value of their assets on the Ethereum protocol. A user can borrow Ethereum-based stablecoins using bitcoin as collateral and redeem at any time. The funding will be spent on further research and development, the project said.      See also: Pompliano Joins Board of Blockchain-Based Lending Firm After $103M Raise      Pompliano has built a reputation on espousing a strongly bullish attitude towards cryptocurrencies, and in particular bitcoin. He is a regular panelist on various U.S. market shows, often advocating for greater crypto adoption among traditional investors. He claimed on NBC's ""Shark Tank"" last August to hold half his net worth in bitcoin.      In a statement, Pompliano said: ""Atomic Loans is building the decentralized financial infrastructure that uses Bitcoin how it was intended."" Such initiatives, he added, help prove the original cryptocurrency would form the basis for an ""alternate financial system.""      Although bitcoin has so far played a minor role in DeFi, other teams are trying to leverage its $123 billion market value. Projects such as Wanchain, Wrapped Bitcoin and Trustless Bitcoin have all focused on creating Ethereum wrappers for bitcoin.      The main difference with Atomic Loans is users can lock in their holding's dollar value, giving them the option to benefit from any possible upside. Brett Gibson, a partner at Initialized Capital, said the startup gave DeFi simple access to the ""largest and most valuable crypto-asset.""      “Atomic Loans is leveraging their deep expertise in Bitcoin scripting and atomic swaps to create a useful DeFi product that works on the Bitcoin blockchain directly without requiring complex synthetics on other blockchains.""

42431721,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5tnh,1586957839,Bailouts Don't Save the Economy. They Prop Up Companies That Should Be Allowed to Fail,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.      The moral case for bailouts often sounds a bit like this:    Unlike prior crises, like the mortgage-fueled crash of 2008–09, there is no villain in 2020; instead, we have an act of God, an undead bundle of proteins wreaking havoc on society. Since this could have been neither predicted nor reckoned with, and since the closure of the economy was a government-mandated response, there is no one at ‘fault’, and hence, all suffering businesses should receive government support. Preserving the current corporate status quo will allow the economy to “restart” when appropriate, returning to its pre-virus makeup.    This logic is unsatisfying for several reasons. First, as I and others have pointed out, bailouts send a signal to the market that alters corporate behavior, encouraging rent-seeking behavior and rewarding excessive risk taking. This is a negative externality that must be acknowledged at the very least. Second, the emphasis on the artificial nature of the crisis is contrived. The economy would be in bad shape even without mandatory lockdowns. And, even in historical cases where exogenous shocks torched particular industries, bailouts failed to restore them to glory, calling into question the merit of deploying those funds in the first place.      See also: Nic Carter - Corporate America Knows the Bailout Is Baked In      Lastly, the virus will not leave society unchanged once it is eliminated; it will fundamentally change the nature of many industries for the foreseeable future. Bailouts ignore this, vainly attempting to preserve the economy in amber, laboring under the misapprehension that society’s pre-virus resource allocation is optimal for the post-virus world. Corporate destruction and reorganization under well-understood bankruptcy processes would allow our resources to be deployed in a fundamentally more productive manner, rather than simply entrenching the existing corporate balance of power.    This is not an artificial crisis    One justification I find puzzling is the notion that this is a government-imposed crisis, as if one day every country worldwide decided to arbitrarily shut their borders and suspend commerce. This is such a staggeringly naive notion that it’s a wonder anyone expresses it. While government inaction certainly exacerbated the crisis, it is not the sole cause. This crisis was set off by the spark of the virus, an epidemic the likes of which we haven’t seen in 100 years, igniting the tinder of a fragile, indebted, globalized economy. If governments had simply chosen to let the virus wash over their citizens, commerce would have ground to a halt anyway. The economic damage from shutdowns cannot be extricated from the damage caused by the virus – it’s all the same phenomenon.    The airline industry after the 2001 bailout was a shambles: every major U.S. airline filed for bankruptcy protection between 2001 and 2011.    Plagues are not good for the economy, government action or not. Indeed, foot traffic in cities dropped sharply long before any mandatory lockdowns were instituted. According to Opentable, restaurant bookings in New York City had dropped by 100 percent (relative to their level 12 months earlier) on March 17; the mandatory lockdown in New York City didn’t begin until March 22 at 8 pm. This pre-lockdown business slowdown was evident in multiple U.S. cities. Highly contagious diseases tend to impair one’s desire to consume.      This is a genuine crisis, not an artificial one. The existence of dramatic government countermeasures is not moral justification for a bailout. Simply enforcing the natural inclination to self-quarantine – which happens in every pandemic – is not sufficient reason to give outsize handouts to shareholders of public companies.    There is no return to the pre-virus era    Bailout supplicants like to claim that if only we can keep corporations intact, we can restart the economy in a pre-COVID-19 state. This is utopian thinking at best. Not only is it looking increasingly clear that we are in for a drawn-out battle, the world seems to be changing dramatically, too. Blindly supporting the largest incumbents in a given sector under pre-crisis assumptions is an easy way to install a zombified, anti-competitive system.      History gives us a fine example of an exogenous, unforeseeable shock that justified a bailout. In 2001, with air travel interrupted by the 9/11 attacks, the government hurriedly passed a $15 billion bailout for the airlines, which would swell to $50 billion over the following years. The airline industry after the 2001 bailout was a shambles: every major U.S. airline filed for bankruptcy protection between 2001 and 2011. US Airways filed twice, in 2002 and 2004. It’s obvious in hindsight that a government guarantee for an industry faced with serious structural issues was inappropriate, and simply ended up deferring their decline.      According to a NY Times postmortem:    The bailout program may actually have made matters worse, some experts say, by forestalling a badly needed shakeout in the industry, keeping the weakest carriers alive at the expense of the others and perpetuating a glut of flights and seats.    An exogenous shock. Moral justification for rapid bailouts. A shakeout forestalled. And an industry on permanent life support, unwilling to reorganize itself into a more efficient model. It all sounds awfully familiar. Airlines will exist post-virus, but in a world of persistent geographical encumbrances, green and red zones, and 14-day quarantines. International travel may well decline in importance. By bailing out airlines and keeping their corporate structures intact, the state attempts to preserve the status quo. But I’d be willing to wager that demand to consume air travel in a post-COVID-19 world will be meaningfully suppressed.      Air travel is an obvious example, but there are numerous sectors looking to maintain a corporate lifestyle which may not suit a post-COVID-19 reality. Travel, cruise liners, amusement parks, tourism, restaurants, outsourced just-in-time manufacturing, commercial real estate – these are a few sectors that may well suffer long-term aftershocks from the crisis. By selectively bailing out industries that might otherwise be justifiably shrinking, consolidating, or chasing efficiencies, the government attempts to dictate market outcomes, recalling Canute’s crusade against the tides. There’s a better way: Let the free market, not the state, price these companies, and let capital flow only to those evaluated as solvent.      See also: Nic Carter - Policymakers Shouldn’t Fear Digital Money: So Far It’s Maintaining the Dollar’s Status      What’s more, the bailout itself contains information. It communicates to CEOs that the coffers are open and the opportunity exists to obtain a free insurance policy from the government, provided you play politics well enough. If in two years’ time, air travel still hasn’t picked up, what’s to stop airline CEOs from returning to the table, asking for more? They will still be able to make identical arguments about the societal virtue of keeping their staff employed and their fleets operational. After all, the virus wasn’t their fault.    No limit to stimulus    There is no natural limit to bailouts, once this form of stimulus is normalized. Virtually every crisis, shock, or disruption, will be used to justify requests for handouts. If preserving employment and retaining the existing corporate setting is prided at all costs, we will end up with a handful of implicitly state-owned enterprises, completely insulated from market rigor. Even if the shocks that provide feedback are unfair or unforeseeable, that doesn’t mean that they are somehow invalid or must be suppressed. And if it so happens that the world changes such that their business no longer boasts the stature it once had, then the market-clearing outcome is for that sector to shrink.      Despite what the stimulus apologists would have you think, there’s no moral case for a bailout – just a reflexive desire to avoid short term pain. If the inflationists truly wanted to reduce harm on a society-wide scale, they would agitate for direct payouts to individuals, rather than demanding instead that these funds be processed through an inefficient corporate filter, which pays out hedge funds on the way.      Some trends cannot be reasoned with or forestalled. If climate change threatens polar bears, so be it. The bailout supplicants would have us install air conditioning in the Arctic.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/15/bailouts-dont-save-the-economy-they-prop-up-companies-that-should-be-allowed-to-fail,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7affb845c6c7350dfc99a0b86460d7fca6f81d58-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

KuCoin's Enterprise Currency Desk (ECD) is tailored toward companies looking to venture into blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) by providing bespoke solutions for the acquisition of digital assets, the company says.      The new partnership seeks to simplify that process for businesses, and further allows them to access larger quantities of tokens to power operations such as wallet authentications, transaction fees and staking.      ""A designated service to address token procurement and liquidity will allow companies to easily engage in blockchain-based solutions, without having to employ experienced traders to obtain and utilize large amounts of tokens,"" the company said in a press release Wednesday.

The online brokerage and trading technology firm said Wednesday it is integrating ErisX's order book into its subsidiary, TradeStation Crypto, to provide clients with deeper liquidity and tighter spreads when trading digital assets.      Both TradeStation and ErisX believe the tie-up will take market infrastructure up to the same sort of standards as already exist in traditional markets. They hope to coax a new generation of participants – who may trade other assets but are uncertain about digital assets – into dipping a toe into the crypto trading space.      ""Adding this digital-asset exchange relationship helps improve our customers’ view of prices across more connected markets,” said James Putra, TradeStation Crypto's director of product strategy. ErisX CEO Thomas Chippas said just working with an established name like TradeStation would help instill confidence in traders interested in the new asset class.

It generally focuses on professional clients, which include hedge funds, family offices and money managers.

Among its other holdings, the group owns a cryptocurrency research and development house as well as CoinCheck, acquired after that exchange fell victim to a $500 million hack in early 2018.      Launching initially as a cash-settled derivative swaps exchange in 2010, ErisX pivoted into cryptocurrencies during the boom time in 2017.

42431741,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5uNh,1586951087,"First Mover: Gold Is Crushing Bitcoin, but Inflation May Bring the Cryptocurrency a Boost","Is physical gold leaving digital gold behind?      It's a question worth asking, with the yellow metal having rallied over the past four trading sessions to reach a new eight-year high, around $1,725 an ounce.      Gold is up 14 percent in 2020, a superlative performance in what has been an annus horribilis for many traditional markets: stocks, oil and industrial metals like copper and aluminum.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      And what about bitcoin, seen by many investors as a digital form of gold due to its perceived use as a hedge against inflation? It's down 4.1 percent on the year.      The gap between gold and bitcoin returns has frustrated traders who predict that trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related emergency aid and monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve and other authorities will eventually lead to inflation.      The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday estimated that the global economy will shrink 3 percent this year, down some 6.3 percentage points below its most-recent projection in January. What's changed, of course, is the pandemic, which has led to business disruptions and travel cancellations while cratering energy demand and decimating consumer spending.      ""The magnitude and speed of collapse in activity that has followed is unlike anything experienced in our lifetimes,"" the Washington-based organization's chief economist, Gita Gopinath, wrote in a blog post.      Recessions are often deflationary: Lower demand alleviates upward price pressure on products and services, while surging unemployment makes it harder for workers to demand wage increases. Deutsche Bank says a U.S. government report on Thursday might reveal another eight million jobless claims filed last week, bringing the four-week total to 25 million – at least 10 times worse than any prior comparable period in the past half-century. The unemployment rate would rise to 17 percent, from 3.5 percent as recently as February.      Federal Reserve officials appear determined to keep inflation at bay. The central bank targets annual price rises of 2 percent, and Vice Chair Richard Clarida told Bloomberg Television that monetary authorities ""have the tools to keep the economy out of deflation."" Translation: More money injections are likely. Last week, the Fed's balance sheet ballooned past $6 trillion for the first time in its 107-year history.      So why isn't bitcoin getting the uplift that gold is enjoying?      One possible reason, according to Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at cryptocurrency-focused firm Arca Funds, is the physical metal is so much easier to buy. That's especially true for traditional investors who have long turned to gold as a safe haven during times of economic and market turmoil.      ""Gold can easily be purchased from the same brokerage accounts as stocks/bonds, whereas bitcoin cannot be,"" Dorman told CoinDesk in an email. ""Anyone who sold equities or debt and is sitting in cash needs to put that money to work, and it's easier to purchase gold than bitcoin.""      It's as plausible an explanation as any, given that bitcoin was launched just 11 years ago, while gold has served as a symbol of riches at least since the Sumerians civilized Mesopotamia.      According to the World Gold Council, an estimated 197,576 metric tons of gold have been mined throughout history. At 32,150.75 troy ounces per metric ton, and based on the current price, that works out to an outstanding value of about $11 trillion.  That's 87 times the outstanding market value of all bitcoin ever produced, currently about $125 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.  ""People that have money, investment capital, they're definitely more familiar with gold,"" says Phillip Meng, who until recently was head of trading for SFOX, a cryptocurrency trading platform. ""Gold is definitely preferable to bitcoin at this point because of just the understanding of the asset and access to the asset.""  In extremely uncertain times, people might simply gravitate toward things that are more certain.  ""I am skeptical that in the time of a severe recession, people would want to deal with an electronic type of entity,"" Frank Shostak, an associated scholar of the Mises Institute and chief economist and director of AAS Economics, told CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole on Tuesday.  Bitcoin has been touted by some proponents as an uncorrelated asset that can help to increase returns in an investment portfolio while reducing overall volatility and risk. But that hasn't stopped analysts from spotting occasional periods where bitcoin seems to trade in sync with counterparts from traditional finance, from gold to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks to the dollar's exchange rate with the Chinese yuan.  In a report published Tuesday, Coin Metrics, a digital-asset research and data firm, ran the math on bitcoin's correlation with gold. Historically, the correlation hasn't been strong, wrote the analysts, led by Nate Maddrey.      But since March 12, the depth of the coronavirus sell-off for bitcoin, the correlation with gold has increased. It's still pretty weak, currently at less than 0.5, where 1 represents perfect synchronicity, 0 is no correlation at all and -1 is a perfectly inverse relationship:      ""These are small pieces of evidence that the correlation between bitcoin and gold may be growing,"" according to Maddrey and the Coin Metrics team. ""However, bitcoin’s overall correlation with gold is still relatively weak.""      What might be just as interesting, if not more, is that, recently at least, bitcoin does appear to be trading in sync with inflation expectations. The Coin Metrics team analyzed the cryptocurrency's correlation with the 5-year forward inflation expectation rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Here's what that looks like:      It's a pretty stark up-slope at the far-right end of the chart.      The takeaway?      ""Although the short term is still uncertain amidst the global pandemic, this could potentially be a long-term inflection point for bitcoin if federal banks around the world continue to inject money into the global economy at historic rates,"" according to the report.      There may be hope yet for the bitcoin bugs.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    Trend: Bitcoin is lacking a clear directional bias for the second day with prices trapped in the $6,600–$7,200 range.      The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization ran into offers near $7,200 over the weekend, as indicated by the long upper wick attached to Sunday's candle. However, the ensuing price dip found buyers near $6,600 on Monday.      The outlook will remain neutral as long as the $600 range is intact. A move above the top end would open the doors for a rally to $7,800 (target as per the measured move method) – a level last seen before the March 12 crash. Alternatively, a range breakdown could encourage sellers and yield a drop to $6,100.      The bearish scenario looks most likely currently, as bitcoin's repeated failure to keep gains above the 100-week average of $7,060 over the last two weeks is indicative of bull fatigue. Further, S&P 500 futures are flashing red at press time, alongside losses in the European equities. Investors are selling risk assets, possibly in response to the International Monetary Fund's forecast of a 3 percent contraction in global GDP in 2020.      That said, losses in both stocks and bitcoin could be limited, with the Federal Reserve injecting an unprecedented amount of liquidity into the system via its open-ended asset purchase program.      Professional investors are also sitting on record amounts of cash, some of which may make its way into the bitcoin market ahead of the next month's reward halving. The event, aimed at controlling inflation, will reduce the amount of bitcoin created every 10 minutes or so from 12.5 BTC to 6.25.      First Mover is CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter.

42431737,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5uHh,1586950221,"More Investors Are Holding Bitcoin Ahead of the Halving, Data Suggests","Investors may be accumulating bitcoin ahead of next month's miner reward halving.      The seven-day moving average of the total number of bitcoin held in exchange addresses fell to 2,214,365 on April 14 – the lowest level since last June – according to numbers from blockchain intelligence firm Glassnode.      As of Tuesday, the average was down nearly 8 percent from a high of 2,404,786 registered on Jan. 17, 2020.      The decline in exchange balances suggests a shift to longer-term holding strategies, according to Glassnode.      That's because investors usually withdraw coins from the exchanges to hold in their personal wallets when prices are expected to rise. Conversely, they tend to move their balances to exchanges in preparation to sell when a price drop is expected or during a price crash.      For instance, bitcoin’s price fell by 33 percent in the seven days to March 15. At the time, the seven-day average of coins held on exchanges rose from 2,333,279 on March 11 to 2,350,795 on March 18.      However, the spike was short lived and the downturn in exchange balances resumed from March 19.      The increased levels of holding may be associated with bullish expectations tied to bitcoin’s mining reward halving, scheduled to take effect in just 27 days. The process, aimed at controlling inflation, will reduce rewards per block mined from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Essentially, miners will be adding fewer coins to the ecosystem following the halving. Some analysts think that would create a supply deficit and push up prices. “Once bitcoin has its halving next month, we expect prices to rally, carrying the rest of the market with it,” said Richard Rosenblum, head of trading at GSR.      Meanwhile, some stock-to-flow models indicate the halving could send bitcoin’s price to $100,000, as noted in the cryptocurrency platform Luno’s weekly market report.      Further, the coronavirus-induced global economic recession and resulting unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus launched by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government, respectively, are widely expected to boost bitcoin’s appeal as a safe haven asset and a hedge against inflation.      However, some observers have been skeptical about the bullish narrative surrounding bitcoin’s halving. “Bitcoin halving in May 2020 won’t do anything to the price. It will be a non-event,” Jason Williams, co-founder of digital asset fund Morgan Creek Digital, tweeted in December.      Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has so far failed to perform as a safe haven asset and has largely moved in line with the equity markets. “Since the beginning of March, bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P and Dow has been unusually high at approximately 0.82,” Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM Ventures, told CoinDesk.      If the decline in exchange balances is a guide, though, the investor community looks to have some belief in the bullish halving narrative and the long-term value of the cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge.      Read more: Why the US’ $2 Trillion Stimulus, Unlimited QE Will Expose the Monetary System’s Flaws      From a technical analysis standpoint, the cryptocurrency’s recovery rally from the March low of $3,867 looks to have run out of steam.    Weekly chart    Bitcoin has failed three times in the last month to keep gains above the 100-week moving average, currently lined up near $7,060. The repeated failure is suggestive of buyer fatigue.      That, coupled with the rising wedge breakdown seen on the daily chart, suggests scope for a downside break of the recent trading range of $6,600–$7,200. A range breakdown, if confirmed, would open the doors to $6,100, as discussed Tuesday.      Read more: Options Market Signals Doubt Bitcoin Price Will Rise After Halving      “Bitcoin has enjoyed an over-50-percent rally from its mid-March low. The bulls now must sustain the rally at an equal or greater pace in the short term or the bears might take back some serious ground,"" said NEM Venture’s Pelecanos. ""Indicators from one of our momentum-based strategies are beginning to show a serious bearish setup that could lead to a 50-percent sell-off, sending prices into the low $3,000s.""

42404467,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiLJS,1586937600,Another Bitcoin Mining Firm Warns COVID-19 Pandemic May Harm Its Business,"Hut 8 Mining Group, a publicly traded cryptocurrency mining firm, is concerned about coronavirus-related delays of new machine deliveries from potential suppliers such as Bitmain and MicroBT.      During an earnings call last week, CEO Andrew Kiguel said his firm was grappling with a vague timeline for the delivery of crypto mining machines to support its farms, saying that while in February, “you thought” machines could be delivered between March and April, these timelines have since shifted due to the ongoing pandemic. He did not have a revised timeline either.      His remarks follow guidance from competitor Riot Blockchain, which also warned the novel coronavirus outbreak would impact its business operations.      “Three or four weeks ago, nobody thought these things would be an issue, and the world is grappling right now with different supply chain issues like getting ventilators and masks around the world as opposed to bitcoin mining machines,” Kiguel said.      Bitmain was one of several Chinese miner manufacturers that warned as far back as January – close to eight weeks ago – it would be forced to delay deliveries due to the coronavirus outbreak.      Bitmain has since resumed operations, though its delivery timetable is still unclear.    Halving concerns    Hut 8 Mining Group, one of the few publicly traded mining firms in the U.S., is also closely watching the upcoming bitcoin halving in hopes of appropriately scaling the size of its mining farm.      The Canadian firm is set to have a higher stake in the bitcoin market after launching its core operation in the middle of 2018 and acquiring facilities to boost its mining power last year. According to its year-end report for 2019, released on Monday, Hut 8 saw $58.6 million in revenue, up by 66 percent from the prior year, thanks to larger capacity and higher bitcoin price.      This places it as one of the productive miners in North America among its competition, including the Colorado-based Riot Blockchain.      Hut8’s coronavirus concerns come as the firm prepares for bitcoin’s hotly anticipated halving, tentatively set to occur in mid-May.      “There's a lot of different scenario planning that we've done,” Kiguel said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/15/another-bitcoin-mining-firm-warns-covid-19-pandemic-may-harm-its-business,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f3ebedb9543a24decf4b31119cd6d4fe00930cb-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404465,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiLHU,1586923200,Riot Blockchain Moves Part of Bitcoin Mining Operation to Upstate New York,"Riot Blockchain, one of the few publicly traded bitcoin mining companies in the U.S., has executed a co-location mining services contract with a crypto data center Coinmint.      Announced Tuesday, the Colorado-based firm will send a portion of its S17 bitcoin mining machines from its facilities in Oklahoma City to Coinmint’s power plant in upstate New York.      The move came two months after Riot purchased 1,060 Bitmain S17 Pro Antminers for that facility. The addition is part of Riot’s recent expansion in bitcoin mining.      The firm bought 4,000 miners from Bitmain with $6.35 million in December and installed 3,000 miners in the following month. The firm expects to boost its computing capacity by 240 percent with the latest addition.      “Riot believes the hosting arrangement can positively impact its power costs, the Oklahoma City facility's heat and environmental operating issues, and provide a path to diversify its mining operations,” Riot said in a statement.      According to the contract, Coinmint's Massena, N.Y., facility will be responsible for initial operational, security and reporting controls testing and verification. As one of the largest crypto data centers in the U.S., Coinmint claims to have 435 megawatts of transformer capacity. It was converted to a data center from an aluminum smelter in 2016.      The plant can generate excess power in part due to the abundant hydroelectric and wind generation in the area. Its management experiences in wholesale electricity markets is another economic advantage for Coinmint to operate mining machines, according to Riot.      Riot has also assessed how COVID-19’s impact on its relocation plan and concluded that the novel coronavirus’ risks are reasonably mitigated due to the ""plug and play '' infrastructure of Coinmint's facilities. “To date, the impact has remained minimal,” Riot said.      Riot’s rearrangement with its mining facilities could also be part of its shift from crypto trading to bitcoin mining businesses. The firm has been on the lookout for potential buyers for its crypto trading platform RiotX since February.
