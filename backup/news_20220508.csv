Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether plummeted over the weekend as investors continued to fret about rising interest rates and the possibility of a recession.  Insights: The BitMEX case leaves regulatory issues unsettled.  Technician's take: A weekly close below $36,247 for BTC could yield further downside targets.

Bitcoin was recently trading at about $34,200, a more than 2% drop, and its lowest mark since last July. Even then, it was doing better than most major altcoins in the CoinDesk top 20 by market capitalization. Ether was changing hands at about $2,550, off roughly 3% over the same period and its lowest point since early March. Terra's luna token tumbled over 8.5% at one point and SOL and CRO were each down about 5%. AXS and TRX shone among the sea of red, rising over 1.5% and 5.5%, respectively.  ""BTC has continued to be weighed down by macro pressures and the general market sentiment,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote to CoinDesk. ""The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) resulted in volatility, but the upside move was short-lived.""  Crypto's declines dovetailed with equity markets, which closed down Friday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq sinking 1.4% a day after tumbling 5% – the latter its worst performance since 2020. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell in smaller increments, but continued their downturn following the U.S. central bank's widely expected, half-point interest rate hike last Wednesday. A day later, the Bank of England (BoE) continued its own more hawkish monetary path, raising rates a quarter of a point to their highest level in 13 years.  It was BoE's fourth-straight interest rate increase since December. Central banks in other parts of the world have followed similar strategies to tame inflation that has reached 40-year highs and threatens to rise further amid the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Meanwhile on Friday, the latest U.S. Labor Department jobs report, which showed a better-than-expected gain of 428,000 jobs in April, underscored concerns that a historically tight jobs market would increase wages and accelerate inflation. During the first quarter of this year, U.S. employers paid workers 1.4% more on average than during the prior three-month period, according to the report. It was the biggest jump in two decades.  DiPasquale expects bitcoin to decline further, especially as monetary policy continues to contract, but doesn't see the largest crypto by market cap falling below the $25,000 to $30,000 range, even if a downturn reaches extreme proportions. But he also noted that ""a bounce in the near term cannot be ruled out"" as May's options expiry of approximately $1.3 billion on the bitcoin futures exchange Deribit approaches.  Insights  Should the BitMEX co-founders have fought the case against them?  Arthur Hayes and BitMEX both decided, separately, that they would plead guilty to the charges before them and pay fines to settle their respective cases with the feds, with Hayes and BitMEX’s other co-founders each being ordered to pay a $10 million fine at the end of last week.  This, as we’ve discussed before, is too bad, because the case against them relied on a novel interpretation of the Bank Secrecy Act and a confirmation that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) really has extraterritorial authority. This type of litigation is expensive and stressful, and so it's understandable why someone might want to call it quits instead of going through with it.  But now, as Hayes awaits sentencing, we are no further ahead in obtaining regulatory clarity than we were before. Terraform Labs’ case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is working its way through the legal system, but it will be months if not longer before it’s in front of a judge. In the meantime, as Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the FTX crypto exchange, pointed out in a recent interview, the “power struggle” between the CFTC and the SEC has resulted in the regulatory environment being stalled.  “We’re not actually in a place with more federal oversight than we were in a year ago,” he told Blockworks, arguing that if the SEC and CFTC could agree on who is responsible for licensing cryptocurrency exchanges it would solve “60% of the problem.”  The CFTC claims that the Commodity Exchange Act of 1934 gives it authority over crypto, which it calls a currency, and thus allows it to regulate the derivatives market for crypto (which is what BitMEX specializes in). At the same time, the SEC’s regulatory mandate comes from testing if a specific cryptocurrency or a product involving the coin constitutes a security.  “The fact remains that digital assets like cryptocurrencies do not fit neatly into the SEC’s regulatory framework,” Bo Howell, a Ohio-based securities lawyer wrote in a post explaining the contested authority over crypto.  In theory, one should regulate the markets and one should regulate the commodity itself, but a pathway needs to be set first. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said last month that it’s a work in progress, but hasn’t given a road map of when something like a memorandum of understanding would be released for regulating the “intertwined” market.  Ideally, this would be through legislation – in previous interviews, ex-CFTC enforcement attorney Braden Perry has warned about the dangers of regulation by enforcement, as opposed to a defined regulatory framework – but another alternative would be via legal precedent.  If Hayes or BitMEX had decided to fight the feds, they might have actually forced a resolution in the case of which agency takes the lead on regulating the crypto market.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Breaking Down, Support at $30K  Bitcoin broke below a short-term uptrend on Friday as momentum signals turned negative. The cryptocurrency could see further declines toward $30,000, which is near the bottom of a yearlong trading range.  BTC failed to hold $40,000 over the past few months and is down by 47% from its all-time high of nearly $69,000 last November. The long-term uptrend has weakened, which suggests upside remains limited this year.  On the weekly chart, BTC is at risk of breaking below its 100-week moving average of $36,247. A second weekly close below that level could yield downside targets toward $30,000 and then $17,823 (a roughly 80% peak-to-trough decline, on par with the 2018 crypto bear market).  Still, May is typically a seasonally strong period for stocks and cryptos. That could keep short-term buyers active at lower support levels, albeit lacking conviction to shift the recent downtrend in price.

42435449,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxv7x,1652035983,Bitcoin Slides to 3-Month Low to Below $34K,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a three-month low Sunday, days after crypto analysts warned that price charts were sending bearish signals.  The bitcoin price was around $34,500 as of press time, down 3.8% over the past 24 hours.  BTC price has fallen for four straight days.  Early Sunday, the largest cryptocurrency slid to $33,710, the lowest since Jan. 24.  If the price falls below $32,951, it would hit a new low since last July.  Bitcoin had stayed mostly between $35,000 and $46,000 for the past couple months, and so the latest price decline might mark the beginning of a new trend.  Popular price-chart indicators were leaning bearish late last week, as bitcoin's price broke below a three-month rising trend line.  A U.S. Labor Department report on Friday showed that employment growth stayed robust last month at a level that should continue to worry the Federal Reserve about a tight jobs market. As more employers compete for workers, wages might start to escalate, adding to inflationary pressures and forcing the Fed to tighten monetary conditions faster. Recently, bitcoin has reacted negatively along with stocks to more aggressive actions by the U.S. central bank.  Some traders may have been rattled by data showing that the Terra blockchain's stablecoin, UST, briefly lost its peg on Saturday. The Luna Foundation Guard, which maintains a standby reserve that kicks in if the ""algorithmic stablecoin"" falls below $1, held about $3 billion of bitcoin as of last week.

42422841,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qM1h,1652032881,"UST Stablecoin Briefly Loses Peg, Luna Drops 10%","The closely watched TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin briefly lost its dollar peg on Saturday, May 7, falling to $0.987 before bouncing back on Sunday. Its sister token, LUNA, fell 10%.  As the largest algorithmic stablecoin, UST has emerged as a major – albeit controversial – backbone of the crypto economy.  UST's loss of its $1 peg this weekend wasn't the first or the largest ""depegging"" event in Terra’s history, but it marks the first time the algorithmic stablecoin has fallen below $1 since it embarked on its much-publicized bid to build out its bitcoin and avalanche reserves.  Losing the peg didn't cause Terra to tap into its bitcoin reserves on Saturday, as the deployment of hundreds of millions of dollars of rescue capital appeared enough to buoy the token back to around $1.  What happened  The depegging appeared to kick off with a series of major withdrawals from Anchor Protocol, a lending market that offers high yields to users who deposit UST. Over the weekend, Anchor’s total UST deposits fell from $14 billion to $11.2 billion (UST’s total circulating supply is $18 billion).  Large quantities of UST were also withdrawn from liquidity pools on Curve, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows users to swap between stable currencies like UST. A $150 million liquidity withdrawal came from Terra creators, Terraform Labs, which claimed Sunday that it made the withdrawal as it was preparing to shuffle around funds between pools, but it redeposited $100 million after realizing UST had begun to trade a discount relative to other stablecoins.  Adding a tinge of conspiracy to Saturday’s events, a single wallet also raised eyebrows for dumping $84 million worth of UST on the Ethereum blockchain and $108 million on the Binance crypto exchange. That led to calls from within the Terra community that the depeg was a “coordinated attack.”  The response  Do Kwon, the outspoken founder of Terraform Labs, chimed in on Saturday with a series of jokes and jabs at “anons” circulating “fud” (fear, uncertainty and doubt).  At one point, Kwon tweeted out a chart with the claim that one wallet was responsible for 62% of Anchor withdrawals. He quickly deleted the tweet, presumably after realizing that the “62%” figure on his chart referred to all “other” wallets rather than one specific wallet.  After Kwon started tweeting on Saturday, a single wallet appeared to be intent on rescuing UST’s peg. In the span of around 10 minutes, the wallet swapped over $200 million of UST for tether in order to rebalance UST’s Curve pools thereby boosting its price. More swaps continued on Sunday morning as UST’s peg recovered.  Some have speculated that the savior wallet belongs to Jump Crypto, a financial firm with strong ties to Terra and Terraform Labs. Jump is the same firm that stepped in to backstop a $320 million exploit of Solana’s Wormhole bridge back in February.  What is UST?  UST relies on another token, LUNA, to keep its price of a dollar via a set of on-chain mint and burn mechanisms.  Read more: What Is LUNA and UST? A Guide to the Terra Ecosystem  Recently, Kwon has made headlines for using LUNA to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a way to partially back UST. That has been framed as a way to secure UST’s peg while maintaining decentralization, but the central role of Kwon and Terraform Labs in buying bitcoin has fueled claims that Terra is centralized.  Thus far there is no concrete link between UST and its BTC/AVAX reserves, which led to questions on Saturday around if or how the currencies could have been deployed to defend UST's peg.

YouTube restored service a few hours later.  The channel, which boasted more than 10,000 hours of content and featured people as notable as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, said in a tweet its account had been terminated.  Attempting to click through to the channel yields a notice saying ""This page isn't available.""  Bankless isn't alone. Other educational web 3 crypto accounts such as Gabriel Haines.eth and the Optimism Collective were shut down as well.  Officials from YouTube weren't immediately available to comment; commentators on Bankless's Twitter thread made comments like ""Wow guys I finally get why we need [Web 3]"" which would prevent an organization from shutting down a channel through decentralization.  The removal of the Bankless channel may not be permanent or a signal that YouTube found anything objectionable in the channel's content. The social media giant has shut down other channels in the past without explanation only to reinstate them at a later time, again without explanation.  On Monday, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki wrote in a tweet that the company had ""clearly made a mistake"" in banning the Bankless channel.

42421611,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoiLN,1652021400,The Fed Raised Rates and Markets Freaked Out,"Two newsletters ago, I ended the column with “Zoom out. Think longer.” And wow, did none of y’all listen. By y’all I mean “all y’all,” the persistent Mr. Market that reacts violently to new news, old news and no news. Sometimes good news is even bad news.  The market does weird things, and so this week I wanted to zoom in on the market’s initial reaction during and subsequent retracement following Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s FOMC press conference on May 4. This week’s newsletter will be chart heavy, but the charts are necessary to tell the story I want to tell about today’s markets and Mr. Market.  That (and maybe more …) below.  – George Kaloudis  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Eight times a year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets. The FOMC is part of the Federal Reserve System (the “central bank” or the Fed) in the U.S. and is made up of 12 presidents from various Reserve Banks (the regional banks that make up the central bank). The FOMC is headed up by Powell. When the FOMC meets, it reviews economic conditions, determines the appropriate stance of monetary policy and assesses the risk of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth. After the meeting, the chairman has a press conference to discuss the FOMC’s view on the economy and announce changes to monetary policy – usually by way of a change in interest rates.  On Wednesday, such a FOMC meeting occurred and Powell announced a 50-basis point (in total, 0.5%) increase in the federal funds rate at around 2:30 pm ET. I specifically mention the time because it is the main item I want to zoom in on this week. The picture of Powell’s face on the following charts marks the start of his press conference. The charts span a period of two days, Wednesday to Thursday.  Here’s bitcoin:  The U.S. Dollar:  The Nasdaq 100:  The 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield:  The S&P 500:  Gold:  At around 2:30 p.m. ET, all of these markets reacted. Bitcoin, Nasdaq 100, S&P 500 and gold went up; the 10-year yield and the U.S. dollar went down. Less than 24 hours later, all of these moves reversed as if nothing had happened. And then they kept reversing (bitcoin got wrecked on Thursday). It was almost as if Powell issued a statement saying, “Psych!” and reneged on everything he said at the press conference.  The markets react  Before we go further, what did Powell tell us and what should have happened? Powell’s comments shouldn’t have been positive for risky assets like stocks – full stop. Rates going up, inflation catching economists by surprise and a contraction in the country’s gross domestic product in the first quarter don’t exactly scream, “Wow, the economy is doing great – more risk please!”  Powell and the Fed also seemed to have replaced “inflation is transitory” with “we will have a soft landing.” That basically means the Fed thinks, “Okay, inflation is high, but we will get this under control without going full Volcker.” Full Volcker refers to how former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker cut inflation from 15% to 3% between 1980 and 1983 by jacking interest rates up to 20% – which would have been great if there wasn’t also a recession at the time.  OK, but markets did eventually reverse and do what was expected of them. Does that matter? I think it does. Here’s why.  First, it gives further credence to the point I made three newsletters ago about narrative driving market moves. I admittedly stole that idea from Benjamin Graham, the spiritual father to both value investing and Warren Buffett. Graham used Mr. Market as an allegory in his book “The Intelligent Investor” to describe the irrationality of the stock market and groupthink.  Markets (especially in the short term) are narrative driven because of Mr. Market. On Wednesday, Mr. Market thought that a 50-basis point interest rate hike wasn’t bad and ignored that inflation was high and GDP contracted. The very next day, Mr. Market said, “Oh wait, that inflation was kind of high. I'm scared of inflation now.” Cue the market reversal.  Second (and I admit this might be alarmist of me, but whatever), this highlights the dangers of a highly connected, information-rich world where high-frequency trading and quantitative firms scrape the internet for clues on how to trade everything. And these firms can react to news faster than anyone. And sometimes they can react “incorrectly.” And now even Mr. Market can react quickly. One of the FOMC’s stated goals is “price stability,” and even though that price stability goal is about goods and services, volatility in markets is also destabilizing. It probably goes without saying (but I’ll say it anyway): Instability is usually not good.  Lastly, and this is really my main point, the market is kind of … uh … absurd? I don’t know. At the very least, it’s too reactionary to ever take it seriously at face value. The market keeps crying wolf. Any time the market reacts to news, we should all collectively take a breath and really think about what the news means.  With that, I urge you again: Zoom out. Think longer.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/08/the-fed-raised-rates-and-markets-freaked-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/688c7be045b8ebf5a42109423789abc39c5dbd07-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
