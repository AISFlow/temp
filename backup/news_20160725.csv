42426966,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyDjh,1469479507,Ethereum's Tale of Two Chains,"Zsolt Felföldi is an ethereum developer working on the Go implementation of the ethereum protocol, sometimes called Geth.  In this opinion piece, Felföldi discusses the emergence of a competing blockchain effort, Ethereum Classic, and why he believes it's important for the project to continue given its implications for blockchains operating on social consensus.  Blockchain is not just a huge pile of data created by miners and users.  It's also not just the specification describing valid state transitions and a genesis block describing initial state. What makes a blockchain valuable is human consensus, a widely held belief that creating machine consensus according to a certain set of rules is useful.  In addition to an exactly specified genesis block, chains are also born with a set of ideas attached to them. Each user can have their own ideas about why the chain might be valuable and how valuable it is.  Unfortunately, one can have assumptions falsely perceived as widespread consensus. These false assumptions will remain undiscovered until an event happens that creates a disagreement about what should be done, whether a fork of the chain would be more valuable than the original one.  At this point, it’s already too late to discuss core values and reach consensus, the damage is done. Where interests were aligned before, there is a conflict now. Everyone is biased and also everyone can assume that others are biased, too. We believed in the existence of a ""social contract"", and suddenly realized there is none (or at least some people are breaking it according to our understanding, and we are breaking it according to their understanding).  You cannot kill the other chain, but you wish it would die. Logical arguments get lost in the flow of hate. A war began. Either you believe in the forked chain or the original one, war is not good.  Surely, a united community with a single chain would have been better, but we cannot have that since we don't agree in core values. Not even inside the Ethereum Foundation. Not having a well-defined ""blockchain social contract"" at genesis time was a huge mistake.  By the way, I had a false assumption about it, too, it was a shocking experience for me to find out that some people inside the Ethereum Foundation actually support the idea of intervention.  I thought we would all agree that there should be no higher ""justice"" than the result of EVM execution, that the ""stolen"" money was the rightful property of the ""thief"", that should be proud of creating a system that can protect his or her property even amidst public outrage. I was definitely not alone with this belief in the Go development team.  As it turns out, we were wrong, people still value their sense of justice higher than the immutable law of code. This realization made me a bit sad, but whatever, being paid to develop the coolest software technology ever is still a dream job, even if (at the moment at least) the majority of people think about it in a different way. I will not call those people stupid. I don’t think they are trolling. I also don’t think they are right just because they are the majority.  Truth doesn’t work that way. I intend to keep an open eye, perceive the events closely and learn as much as possible from the evolution of the current situation.  What I realized so far is that a blockchain without a well-defined social contract will sooner or later face serious problems. At this moment, interestingly, the old ""classic"" chain is the one that already has a better contract. It’s the one that hasn’t been changed, but splitting off the majority of its value into a new chain changed its implied contract.  We can assume that whoever finds the old chain valuable believes that unintended contract behavior is no reason to fork. That chain will never face another crisis because of a similar event. On the other hand, ether holders of the new chain might still disagree if this fork was a precedent for all similar cases or just a one-time disaster fix that shouldn’t happen ever again.  I’m not saying that the forked chain is doomed. What I’m saying is that it still lacks a strategy for such cases.  Until the next major unintended event happens, we might still have time to figure out and reach a consensus about what to do in such a case, so that people can make decisions on what can and what cannot happen to the chain they’re trusting their money with. In any case, I urge everyone to calm down and not be hostile towards the people of the other camp because what happens now hurts the project and both chains a lot.  Everyone has a right, even moral obligation to follow their own set of values, and it would be really easy to do this in a civilized way.  Maybe the old chain will survive, maybe not. The main reason I’d like to keep it alive is because it’s such an interesting and important experiment to see how two similar chains with different implied agreements will evolve.  It might even increase the overall chance of success for the project (and your chances of not losing all your money in a potential next crisis if you’re keeping ETH on both chains).  But let’s make it clear that we (the ethereum developers) have never abandoned the old chain. We never forked the chain. We have implemented a switch in our client to give users a choice to fork if they want to and that’s all. The ""Ethereum Classic"" chain is just as much our child as the forked one, and if both of them survive (which is the users’ choice, not ours), then I intend to take care of them equally in the future too.

42426971,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyDth,1469479025,"In Rejecting Bitcoin as Money, Florida Court Sets Likely Precedent","A Miami judge has dismissed charges against a Florida-based bitcoin seller after he was indicted in 2014 on illegal money transmission and money laundering charges.  Judge Teresa Mary Pooler sided with the defense's argument that bitcoin doesn't constitute a form of money within the confines of Florida’s legal system, stating in a ruling issued today that Michell Espinoza doesn't qualify as a money transmitter as argued by the prosecution. The case was tried in the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida.  Observers say that the ruling exposes how state statutes don’t account for bitcoin and digital currencies – a gap that could ultimately lead to legislative action both in Florida and beyond.  The case dates back to late 2013, when a task force involving the Miami Police Department and the US Secret Service began investigating bitcoin trading activity in the area. Espinoza was contacted by Detective Ricardo Arias and Special Agent Gregory Ponzi via bitcoin marketplace LocalBitcoins, arranging several meetings between January and February 2014.  It was during those meetings that undercover agents indicated that they intended to purchase stolen credit card numbers with the digital currency. Espinoza was ultimately arrested during a planned sale of $30,000 in bitcoin, after selling $1,500 in bitcoin to the agents.  Yet in her ruling, Judge Pooler rejected the idea that Espinoza was engaged in any illegal activity as it related to both the money laundering and money transmission charges.  On the latter point, she said that the statute as it exists today accounts for financial intermediaries (citing Western Union in particular), whereas in her view, Espinoza was an individual selling his bitcoins directly.  Pooler wrote:  ""This court is unwilling to punish a man for selling his property to another, when his actions fall under a statute so vaguely written that even legal professionals have difficulty finding a singular meaning.""  Elsewhere in the ruling, Pooler suggested that lawmakers in Florida may want to move to address how the statutes, as they exist today, do not account for bitcoin and digital currencies.  ""The Florida Legislature may choose to adopt statutes regulating virtual currency in the future,"" she wrote. ""At this time, however, attempting to fit the sale of bitcoin into a statutory scheme regulating money services businesses is like fitting square peg in a round hole.""  Espinoza did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  Bitcoin not money, judge rules  In her ruling, Pooler argued that, at present, it is difficult for the court to accurately define bitcoin.  ""Nothing in our frame of reference allows us to accurately define or describe bitcoin,"" she wrote.  She goes on to write that the digital currency ""may have some attributes in common with what we commonly refer to as money"" before going on to highlight its distributed nature, price volatility and adoption by merchants as characteristics that differentiate it from other kinds of currency.  ""This court is not an expert in economics, however, it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, that bitcoin has a long way to go before it is the equivalent of money,"" she wrote.  Pooler noted in her ruling that the state could move, via legislative action, to craft a specific legal definition for bitcoin – a move she indicated could prevent further cases like this from potentially impacting otherwise innocent people.  ""There is unquestionably no evidence that the defendant did anything wrong, other than sell his bitcoin to an investigator who wanted to make a case,"" she wrote, adding:  ""Hopefully, the Florida legislature or an appellate court will define ‘promote’ so individuals who believe their conduct is legal are not arrested.""  Legal experts weigh in  Legal observers say that the case highlights apparent gaps in Florida’s legal system as it relates to bitcoin, and, perhaps, the US more broadly.  Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw attorney Marco Santori, who called the ruling ""quite unexpected among the legal community"", believes that the Espinoza outcome will likely be cited in the future if the government brings future cases like it.  ""It’s absolutely going to be used as precedent in other cases,"" he said.  Santori went on to note that the ruling highlights a split between regulators in Florida and the court on the question of bitcoin regulation.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Right now, we're left with a real split in Florida. We’ve got a regulator that says, you need a license to do direct purchase and sale of bitcoin in Florida. But we’ve got a judicial system that refuses to convict anybody who does that.""  Baker Marquart attorney Brian Klein said he thinks the ruling could go as far as dissuade similar cases in the future as well.  ""This decision will reverberate throughout the country and hopefully cause federal and state prosecutors to think twice before pursuing similar criminal charges,"" he said.  Drew Hinkes, a lawyer for Berger Singerman LLP, said he sees the legislative actions focused on digital currencies advocated by Pooler taking place.  ""The Court also correctly noted that while Florida’s money laundering statutes do not apply cleanly to bitcoin, the Florida Legislature has the ability to provide 'a much needed update to the particularly language within [the money laundering] statute,'"" he said, adding:  ""I would not be surprised to see legislation addressing virtual currencies in the coming years.""

42426967,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyDph,1469475822,Alternative Ethereum Blockchain Gains Support as Price Declines,"Ethereum Classic went from a protest vehicle to a more serious project this weekend following notable nods of support from major exchanges and community members.  That momentum continued today as activity surrounding its new blockchain continued in earnest, and market participants voiced their enthusiasm for the effort. Now, the eighth largest digital currency with a $37m market cap, Ethereum Classic is listed on several exchanges and has quickly built up a small network of services.  For those who haven't been following, the rise of Ethereum Classic is the latest twist in the narrative surrounding The DAO, the $150m fundraising vehicle compromised in June.  To recover the funds, ethereum developers solicited a community vote early this month, a process that resulted in the decision to ""hard fork"" its blockchain last week, or implement a change to the code that would return funds to investors.  Still, while presumed to have an endorsement from the community, the decision was met with resistance by a notable minority.  Idea grows  This small, but growing contingent of the ethereum community has continued to maintain a blockchain with the alternative account history (Ethereum Classic), one in which a copy of the original funds are still under control of the anonymous person who executed the attack on The DAO.  For now, just how serious the support is for the project, or whether it will emerge with a unique value proposition, seems uncertain.  Early feedback from the market, however, is positive.  With a trading volume in excess of $10m over the past 24 hours, ethereum classic is just $14m in trade volume behind ether, the native currency for the ethereum blockchain containing the hard fork code (sometimes called Ethereum One or Ethereum Core).  The boost in publicity seems to have briefly sent the Ethereum Classsic market cap up to $77m, but the benefits of the attention have been declining.  At press time, the price of classic ethers was down 44% in the past 24 hours.  Miners see profit potential  Outside the exchanges, Ethereum Classic also seems to be gathering traction from miners who see a value in securing its distributed ledger.  Though skeptics argue miners on the new branch of the ethereum blockchain should stay calm until the novelty wears off, one early bitcoin adopter has thrown a considerable amount of hashing power into the Ethereum Classic effort.  J. Maurice estimates he at one time represented 50% of all mining power on Ethereum Classic, a testament to his confidence in the project. In interview, Maurice said that he believes Ethereum Classic supports his views by rejecting the idea that intervention was necessary to save DAO investors.  Maurice said:  ""I’m just another crypto-anarchist with a warehouse full of GPUs. I’m just supporting the original blockchain I always have. Apparently, a lot of other people agree.""  Co-founder of WizSec, a security startup best known for looking into the Mt Gox's transaction records, Maurice said he threw 10 GH/s of mining power into Ethereum Classic when he saw the difficulty to mine a block fall below 1%.  At the time he started mining, the full amount of power on the network was only 20 GH/s, which allowed him to mine 31 blocks in a row, accumulating over 20,000 ETC in just two days.  Investment potential  But that success rate is falling, Maurice says, as more people are recognizing that Ethereum Classic could offer the same functionality as Ethereum, but for a fraction of the cost.  Since Poloniex listed Ethereum Classic, Maurice says he’s only solved 34 of the last 1,000 blocks or so, a sign that reflects growing interest from miners.  Today, cryptocurrency mining pool MinerGate added Ethereum Classic support, and BitMEX and ShapeShift.io revealed they should be announcing support soon.  Mining pools Epool.io and ethteam are now mining Ethereum Classic and the largest ethereum exchange by hashing power, F2Pool has said via Twitter it intends to support the currency.  That said, blockchain data tells a slightly different story.  At press time  , the total hashing power supporting Ethereum Classic was 173.7 GH/s, or about 2% of the Ethereum network. This was down from over 5% yesterday.  Not so fast  Successes aside, Ethereum Classic still has its skeptics.  Among them is former Goldman Sachs trader and Bain Capital analyst, Maxime Boone, who told CoinDesk he would only invest in Ethereum Classic if it attracted volumes of at least one-third of ether.  But Boone, now the director of bitcoin market maker B2C2, is skeptical this will happen. ""I don't think it will,"" he said.  Still, the man who launched Ethereum Classic, who goes by the name Arvicco, said he's ready to support the project long enough to potentially convince Boone and other traders to invest.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Arvicco said he’s being contacted by developers who have expressed an interest in building on the Ethereum Classic blockchain.  Arvicco said:  ""Satoshi [Nakamoto, bitcoin’s creator] waited three years before people started to take his creation seriously. I don’t think it will take exactly this long in our case, but some time will no doubt pass before people assign appropriate value to our token.""

42426969,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyDvh,1469464463,Gibraltar Stock Exchange to List Bitcoin Investment Product,"A private stock exchange based in Gibraltar is adding an exchange traded instrument (ETI) invested in bitcoin.  The BitcoinETI, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange announced today, is being issued by a firm called iStructure PCC PLC, based in Gibraltar. Local firms Argentarius ETI Management Limited and Revoltura Limited were also involved with the issuance. The exchange said it was the first of its kind approved in Europe.  The ETI is reportedly being co-listed by marketplace organizer Deutsche Börse, according to the announcement, though that service has yet to independently confirm its participation. Deutsche Börse did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Bitcoin ETI is also said to have the support of local regulators in Gibraltar, and according to one of the firms backing the product, is one of several in a planned pipeline tied to digital currencies.  In a statement published alongside the announcement, Financial Services and Gaming government minister Albert Isola said:  ""We continue to work with the private sector and our regulator on an appropriate regulatory environment for operators in the digital currency space and the launch of this ETI on our stock exchange demonstrates our ability to be innovative and deliver speed to market.""  The Financial Services and Gaming Department was not immediately available for comment.  The listing comes months after the exchange first announced that it would allow the listing of ETIs.

42426976,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyEDh,1469448717,PwC FinTech Lead Joins Blockchain Startup Libra,"PwC US FinTech lead Jeremy Drane has officially left the 'Big four' firm to serve as chief commercial officer for blockchain startup Libra.  Formerly a startup offering tax compliance and reporting software to bitcoin users, the move comes amid a transition at Libra that finds the startup seeking to establish itself as a ""management information layer"" for blockchain technologies.  In accordance with this goal, Libra used the announcement to highlight other recent hires from the enterprise finance sector, noting its COO Dave Albert was formerly with BNY Mellon, while VP of product strategy Deepak Rao boasts experience at Visa.  In interview, Libra CEO Jake Benson spoke about larger changes at the company, which raised $500,000 in funding in late 2014.  Benson told CoinDesk:  ""The marketplace knows us as LibraTax and I want the marketplace to know that that was a stepping stone to where we’re at now.""  Drane further spoke to the reason behind his departure, voicing his belief Libra can provide an essential service by helping non-technical business execs better utilize blockchain data.  In addition to his larger FinTech role, Drane was also PwC's blockchain and smart contracts lead.  ""Any blockchain is a transactional system, and those transactions will need to be enriched so that business users can execute various business processes,” Drane said.  Product overhaul  Key to this success, according to Drane and Benson, will be Libra’s enterprise product, which offers a tools layer that allows for both reporting on blockchain and non-blockchain data and an interface layer that allows for this data to be visualized.  The company said it intends to continue to offer its prior tax product.  ""Essentially, Libra is focused on reducing the cost, time and risk associated with executing blockchain experiments and implementations, while increasing the probability of funding and executive support as projects move through enterprise software evaluation processes,"" Drane explained.  During his time with PwC, Drane was one of its more vocal executives in speaking about the potential for blockchain, overseeing its partnership with blockchain industry firms including Blockstream, Digital Asset Holdings and Eris Industries.  Benson sought to position Libra now as similarly well-rounded, noting the company now has executives from PwC, BNY Mellon, Capgemini and Visa in its ranks.  'Big four' changes  Overall, both Drane and Benson spoke to a change they believe is coming to professional services, whereby blockchain becomes a key part of how enterprise firms automate reporting needs.  ""What's going to most likely happen is 'Big four' structures will change,"" Drane said. ""The partnerships, the tech players, the ecosystems that they create to support their businesses will change, and we expect that we will be a player in that change.""  Drane said that Libra’s goal is to be ""required"" in every blockchain application, a goal he asserts the company has the ability to reach.  The company stressed that its “design-driven” interface is an immediate competitive advantage today, positioning it as more refined than current open-source blockchain tools.  However, Benson sought to position Libra as having room for expansion even beyond its current goals.  For example, he foreshadowed a future in which consumer ""life events"" could take place on a blockchain, leading any business liabilities to be instantly automated.  Benson concluded:  ""Whatever the case, whatever the asset class, whatever the protocol, you need a set of tools. We’re the Microsoft Office for tools for blockchains for business.""
