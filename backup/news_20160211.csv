42398875,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8WV,1455228613,Russian Central Bank Official Predicts Blockchain Future,"The deputy chair of Russia’s central bank has reportedly told commercial banking representatives that they should expect their industry to embrace blockchain technology in the next two years.  Moscow-based Rambler News Service has reported that deputy chair Olga Skorobogatova, appointed in 2014, told members of the country’s banking sector that the central bank sees a major role for blockchain applications in finance as the technology gains traction among the world’s financial institutions.  According to the news outlet, Skorobogatova said:  ""In 2017-2018, we will see real examples of the use of this system. As a closed system, I think, [the blockchain] is the future, and we need to prepare for it.""  The comments come as Russia inches closer to legislation regulating so-called money surrogates, a classification of non-government issued currencies that includes bitcoin and other digital currencies.  Earlier this month, an advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin remarked that the acceptance of bitcoin would constitute a crime.  However, questions have been raised about how the country would go about actually prohibiting activities involving the digital currency. At the same time, private businesses in Russia have begun exploring applications of the technology, with payments firm Qiwi going as far as declaring its intention to issue its own kind of cryptocurrency.

42398872,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8VW,1455226191,Stock Market Giant Deutsche Börse Working on Blockchain Prototypes,"Given the potential applications for distributed ledgers in clearing and settlement, blockchain technology is increasingly drawing interest from major stock market operators.  Among the most early and active financial firms exploring the technology have been major US firms including Nasdaq, which has launched its own blockchain-based service for private shares; the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which in 2015 invested in bitcoin exchange provider Coinbase; and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), which is working with Digital Asset Holdings to develop blockchain solutions.  Less vocal among this group has been Deutsche Börse, operator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the largest in the German market, and a recent investor in Digital Asset's $60m funding round. Headquartered in Frankfurt Rhein-Main, the group had 4,540 employees at the close of 2014, and received a net revenue of over €2bn in the last financial year.  The move to explore blockchain is perhaps unsurprising given the fact that the German financial giant's business covers the whole process chain, from securities and derivatives trading, to clearing, settlement and custody.  According to Heiner Seidel, a spokesperson for the group, Deutsche Börse has been interested in blockchains for some time, but is still looking for the best way to approach the technology.  Seidel told CoinDesk:  ""Like many other companies, at the beginning we analyzed the potential of bitcoin and quickly realized the relevance of the technology underlying bitcoin.""  In a new interview, Seidel spoke more candidly about the efforts ongoing at Deutsche Börse and its developing thesis on the technology.  Prototypes in development  Intriguingly, Seidel noted the group is already working on multiple proofs of concept for the technology.  ""Since early 2015, we have a dedicated project which has been analyzing the market, identified potential use cases and [that] even developed some prototypes,"" he said.  Rather than risking focusing on any single use case for the tech, the group is taking a broad view of the possibilities for distributed ledgers across a number of its business lines.  While research and development into blockchain-based systems may be ongoing, providing infrastructure for financial firms places responsibilities on the group and its services in terms of efficiency, security and robustness.  ""As operator of critical market infrastructure,"" Seidel said, ""we have to fulfill certain business requirements to ensure orderly trading and clearing.""  The comments echo findings from Aite Group, which has found that issues with interoperability between existing and legacy systems was likely to be a bigger concern for financial institutions as they move forward with the technology.  Echoing some criticisms that have been directed at bitcoin's blockchain in recent months, he continued:  ""Our IT systems have to be robust, reliable, fast and fail-safe. Topics like latency or scalability are important prerequisites.""  Continued exploration  Going forward, the group has plans to get more deeply involved in the blockchain space, according to Seidel, and will take a ""three-dimensional"" approach to achieve this aim.  Firstly, the ongoing internal development of software and applications based on the group's IT expertise as a market operator is set to continue.  He further explained Deutsche Börse intends to participate in industry consortiums and efforts such as the Hyperledger Project, an open-source project to create a blockchain fabric for businesses led by the Linux Foundation.  Formerly known as the Open Ledger Project, the Hyperledger Project was first revealed in December as a cross-industry initiative boasting participants such as Cisco and IBM as well as blockchain industry startups such as Digital Asset and R3CEV. This week, the project announced that it now has 30 members on board.  Finally, as evidenced by the recent investment in Digital Asset, Deutsche Börse is open to acquiring stakes in FinTech startups, stating it will do so ""where appropriate and reasonable"".

42398887,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8hK,1455221833,Industry Businesses Pledge to Avoid Bitcoin Network Split,"Just hours after the release of an alternative implementation of the bitcoin software, a group of miners, exchanges and service providers who work with the digital currency issued a letter stating that they would not back any ""controversial"" changes to the bitcoin network.  The letter  calls for an increase in the cap that currently limits the bitcoin blockchain's transaction processing capabilities while also voicing support for a proposal called Segregated Witness, code previously put forward by the team behind the majority-used Bitcoin Core software as part of a broader scalability roadmap.  Those signing the letter said they reject the viability of a ""contentious hard-fork"", a change to the bitcoin software that makes previous versions incompatible. In this instance, all of the network's users would either have to download new software in order to be part of the new chain, or transaction history, or continue running the old version.  In the case of Bitcoin Classic, the change could result in one network operating with blocks with a 2MB block size cap and another with the existing 1 MB cap.  The letter reads:  ""We think any contentious hard fork contains additional risks and potentially may result in two incompatible blockchain versions, if improperly implemented. To avoid potential losses for all bitcoin users, we need to minimize the risks. It is our firm belief that a contentious hard-fork right now would be extremely detrimental to the bitcoin ecosystem.""  The publication followed the release of Bitcoin Classic, an effort to raise the block size limit of the bitcoin network by means of a hard fork. Prior to the release of the client, those backing the project claimed significant support from the bitcoin mining community, going as far as listing a number of mining entities on the project’s main website.  Yet, doubts remained as to the level of support from miners (particularly those based in China) for the Bitcoin Classic proposal.  The letter’s signatories include mining entities BitFury, BW.com, BTCC, F2Pool and GHash.IO, a list that constitutes close to 70% of the bitcoin’s hash rate distribution, according to data from Blockchain.info.  Most notably, the letter states that signatories would not run production-grade versions, nor would they mine blocks as part of a hard fork of the bitcoin network, naming Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin XT, an earlier proposal to hard fork the network, specifically.  The letter explains:  ""We are as a matter of principle against unduly rushed or controversial hard-forks irrespective of the team proposing and we will not run such code on production systems nor mine any block from that hard-fork. We urge everyone to act rationally and hold off on making any decision to run a contentious hard-fork (Classic/XT or any other).""  Those signing the letter also called for greater collaboration with the team behind Bitcoin Core, though the wording notably does not preclude those involved from running test versions of the Bitcoin Classic network.  ""In the next three weeks, we need the Bitcoin Core developers to work with us and clarify the roadmap with respect to a future hard-fork which includes an increase of the block size,"" the letter states. ""Currently we are in discussions to determine the next best steps.""  A full list of signatories can be found here.

42398894,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8oD,1455210023,Why Bitcoin’s Scaling Debate is An Opportunity Not a Flaw,"Nozomi Hayase PhD, is a writer covering issues of freedom of speech, transparency and decentralized movements.  In this article, she argues bitcoin's divisive scalability debate should be seen as just another phase in the growth for the digital currency project.  The prolonged scaling issue has turned into what some have been calling bitcoin's existential crisis.  As proposals for alternative solutions to Bitcoin Core’s roadmap were put forward and Bitcoin Classic gained traction, the divergence in technical approach has devolved into a heated debate. Emotionally charged disputes on Reddit and Twitter with censorship and personal attacks have divided the community.  This split over the protocol harkens back to differences in views that arose at the onset of this technology between economists and those with computer science backgrounds. The former often denounced it as a deflationary currency with fundamental flaws, while the latter tended to praise it and tout its significant potential.  Since its inception, the question of what bitcoin is has continuously evolved. As it began to mature, bitcoin slowly shed layers of skin, helping people view the technology on its own merits.  Perhaps, this recent block size debate marks another phase in bitcoin's development, calling for an even deeper understanding of Satoshi's invention.  Unprecedented security model  At its genesis, bitcoin was envisioned to be a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash. In the seminal white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto stated it would allow ""online payments be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution"".  The core invention solves the problem of double-spend using ""a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions"". Satoshi outlined how the implementation of this required ""hash-based proof-of-work forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work"".  In a nutshell, bitcoin is a peer-to-peer security network that has never existed before. This new security backed by mathematics enables censorship resistance and monetary sovereignty, making it a globally seamless network, unlike any legacy financial system.  At the Hong Kong Scaling Bitcoin conference, developer Andrew Poelstra explained the security assumption that bitcoin lives in an adversarial environment. He noted how the possibility of individuals acting selfishly and taking advantage of others needs to be factored into designing governance. Bitcoin Core software contributor Peter Todd also emphasized the necessity of thinking in adversarial terms when creating incentives for decentralization.  Upon this security assumption, the architecture of bitcoin governance was built in a manner that reduces the probability of attackers and encourages nodes to stay honest.  This was made possible through a combination of game theory, a careful calculation of risk and reward and a balance of supply and demand. This governance includes a 1MB block size limit that was set by Satoshi as a temporary security measure to prevent spam attacks until the network grew.  Growing towards its limits  The cumulative knowledge of computer science has resulted in the creation of the incentive structure as it exists now. In this, bitcoin possesses economics of scarcity with its monetary design of finite supply. For those who haven’t engaged fully in this security assessment, what they often see is a currency mimicking a gold-like commodity.  With this image of digital gold, bitcoin made its public debut. ""Currency as its first app"" became like a promo code for this groundbreaking invention, and speculators and investors alike flocked around this new asset-based currency.  At its young age, bitcoin was recognized for its capacity to become a good store of value. Yet, for those who wish to see wider consumer adoption and it to be used for everyday transactions, realization of the promise of peer-to-peer electronic cash still seemed a bit out of reach.  In 2015, bitcoin was shown to be the best performing currency globally. Now, with the increase of users and transactions, the average block size has moved closer to Satoshi’s 1MB limit.  As the fear of reaching this limit grew, alternative proposals for addressing the issue emerged, such as Bitcoin XT, which required fundamental changes to the protocol. Core developers responded to this hard fork attempt with concerns about the security trade-off that such a measure would bring.  The gap of understanding of this technology that manifested in the earlier days as a divide between economists and computer scientists seemed to have resurfaced in these block size debates. This schism recently widened with former bitcoin developer Mike Hearn’s 'ragequit' and his farewell letter that declared bitcoin a failure.  Token of security  What does this crisis really mean to the bitcoin community and beyond?  There is a Chinese proverb in which a crisis is understood as ""an opportunity to ride the dangerous wind"". This block size debacle is perhaps providing us an opportunity to better understand the core of this invention and make informed decisions at this pivotal moment in the technology’s development.  Bitcoin is more than just currency. It is more than a store of value or medium of exchange. Its underlying technology, the blockchain is an immutable ledger. Its unprecedented security of distributed trust requires incentive for participants to work honestly according to the rule of consensus.  Unlike large data center-based ledgers, this blockchain can’t exist without bitcoin being used as a reward for miners to maintain its decentralization.  All things considered, the current scaling challenge is revealing that we don’t actually fully have currency as bitcoin’s first app yet. As the technology’s foundation is built out, what we are seeing is the bitcoin token, critical for the security system, now tussling with its own nature as a medium of exchange.  In this context, what does this challenge of increasing transaction capacity present? It may indicate how important it is for us not to conflate two distinct problems. Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network is used as a solution to solve the problem of double spending. Here, its economics is designed in service to security to create, store and move value without having a central point of control.  On top of this security model, currency as a first application can be created to solve the challenge of becoming a medium of exchange that functions as transactional currency at a large scale.  Platform for permissionless innovation  Once we understand the principles required to maintain this technology’s core, we can engage in the efforts to make currency bitcoin's first application, without compromising its underlying security.  CEO of Ciphrex and longtime contributor to Bitcoin Core Eric Lombrozo suggested building layers on top of the base of cryptographic proof.  He pointed out his belief that this approach is similar to how the Internet was built:  ""For bitcoin, at the bottom level we have this consensus layer. The consensus layer is actually not a network protocol at all. It’s actually a set of cryptographic commitment structures, which allow you to construct proofs that things happened according to certain rules. This is something that allows everyone to eventually come to agreement on what the state of the network is.""  A robust P2P transfer network can be built on varied economic structures, in added layers compatible with, and in a manner that supports, the underlying consensus rules.  Another breakthrough innovation called Segregated Witness has recently emerged that could roll out concrete steps in this direction. Introduced by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream engineer Pieter Wuille, 'SegWit' separates signatures from transactions and resolves a prevailing problem of transaction malleability. It also has a positive side effect in scaling by increasing bitcoin's block size capacity without increasing the block size limit.  SegWit Testnet  has now been deployed and is an essential component in Bitcoin Core’s roadmap as a soft fork, which brings changes without breaking the existing consensus rules and is considered to be a much safer approach.  All this, combined with sidechains or off-chain scalability solutions like the Lightning Network, makes creative solutions available that could help bitcoin grow horizontally, while staying true to its unique decentralized nature.  After seven years of existence, in spite of wild waves of volatility and media frenzies claiming the death of the cryptocurrency, bitcoin has been moving forward without disruption. If we enter this scaling challenge as an opportunity to solidify consensus, we may all be able to enjoy the fruits of what this amazing invention can truly offer.  The permissionless innovation that the platform of consensus provides invites us to build as many diverse applications and networks as possible. We are now at the dawn of a new era of finance brought about by cryptographic trust.

42398883,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8dO,1455203934,PayPal Blocks Bitcoin Parody of Super Bowl Commercial,"A parody of a PayPal Super Bowl commercial that was posted on YouTube has been blocked by the payments company.  The video advertisement, PayPal's first promotion during the popular American sporting event, positions the firm as “New Money” versus the more archaic “Old Money"".  According to the Wall Street Journal, after bitcoin supporters became ""riled"" at the ad's claim, Shiloh Silverman, owner of video production firm Silver Park Studio, made a new version of the video. His spoof cut in images of people using bitcoin and replaced “PayPal” with “Bitcoin is newer money”.  However, after Silverman posted the video to YouTube, PayPal objected, and the parody was blocked as of Monday.  “Our vision of New Money includes Bitcoin,” a PayPal spokesperson wrote in an email to WSJ. “But to avoid customer confusion, we asked them for the video to be removed.”  The payments firm also claimed that the ""imitation"" commercial was ""the sincerest form of flattery"", and further suggested it proved people were excited by its ad concept.  Silverman, who has since published a new parody of the PayPal ad, told the news source:  “I’m not a bitcoin fanatic, I just love the whole world of it.”  Bitcoin friendly  While PayPal primarily conducts its business in fiat currencies, the company is not averse to bitcoin.  The firm recently appointed CEO of bitcoin firm Xapo to its board, and in September 2014 notably set up partnerships with three major payment processors in the bitcoin space – BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin.  Although the online e-commerce pioneer did not integrate bitcoin into its services directly, PayPal allows online merchants to accept bitcoin via the three companies through its Braintree payments hub.

42398877,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh8XU,1455187092,"Linux, IBM Share Bold Vision for Hyperledger Project, a Blockchain Fabric for Business","No longer a group of thinkers and entrepreneurs on the fringe, the proponents of blockchain technology are growing in number, boosted by new attention from the media, financial institutions, professional services firms and, most recently, major tech giants.  The development comes amid reports that the blockchain market could expand to account for more business in the coming years, with Aite Group projecting it could be worth as much as $400m in annual business by 2019.  However, how this market takes shape, and which technology providers start to generate actual revenue, is less clear given the variety of new projects arising – from consortiums composed of financial institutions to open-source collaborations. What's more, each of these groups boasts a who’s-who list of well-known backers.  Entering this market is the Hyperledger Project, an ambitious attempt to unite the industry’s technologists with those seeking to leverage the technology. The effort intends to follow the open approach to innovation that has propelled the adoption of projects such as Linux, the popular open-source operating system that has led to the creation of $1bn companies such as Red Hat, which delivers Linux solutions for enterprise firms.  So far, a broad selection of institutions interested in the technology has voiced support for the Hyperledger project, which is described in statements as an ""open-source project to advance blockchain technology"" under the oversight of the Linux Foundation, and with participation from 30 partners, including startups, banks and IT firms.  The development comes at a time when major financial institutions have continually voiced their confidence in permissioned or private blockchain networks that limit the parties involved in the operation of a distributed ledger, while at the same time criticizing public versions of blockchain technology – such as that underlying bitcoin – as ill-equipped to handle the requirements of businesses.  As put forth by Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s vice president of blockchain technologies and a participant in the initiative, the Hyperledger Project aims to apply the ideas behind the blockchain to a wider variety of use cases.  Cuomo told CoinDesk:  ""We set off to engineer a blockchain fabric from the ground up. It’s not about creating a consortium in some industry, we’re setting out on a mission to build a blockchain for business.""  According to Jim Zemlin, the Linux Foundation’s executive director, the discussion is currently taking shape around high-level questions, such as how the very different blockchain consensus algorithms in use today could be leveraged for a solution that maximizes the efforts of those who are developing code.  ""What I see is a complete willingness for these entities to genuinely collaborate on technology decisions, even if it’s not their own,"" he said.  Hyperledger has so far received code from three industry stakeholders, including Blockstream, a development company building solutions that extend the capabilities of the bitcoin blockchain; Ripple, the developer of a public, permissioned distributed ledger aimed at cross-border payments; and Digital Asset Holdings, a blockchain startup seeking to innovate in capital markets.  Also contributing code has been IBM, which in recent weeks has been increasingly vocal about its position on how an open, innovative approach is needed to create a true platform for value exchange and why today's blockchain tech falls short of meeting the needs of the business market.  'Organic' conversation  Among the doubts facing Hyperledger is a perceived lack of clarity on what might be ultimately produced by the initiative.  Zemlin acknowledged that exactly how the project will move toward a specific solution is unclear, but that this is intended so those parties wanting to be involved can determine the best path forward.  ""One things about these communities is that they’re organic. What is clear is that they want to establish an open blockchain infrastructure. They, as a technical community, will be defining the scope of that effort,"" Zemlin said.  Zemlin, who has been executive director at the Linux Foundation since 2007, positioned the developing conversation as one that is focused on applying blockchain to use cases such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital rights management.  This inclusive approach was echoed by Cuomo, who said that the goal of the project lies not in making existing solutions compatible, but in designing a new solution that allows for both privacy and auditing.  Cuomo said:  ""It’s not impossible to do those things on other fabrics, but we wanted to build a fabric [with these ideas] in its DNA from its inception. We all share one thing, Ethereum or bitcoin or Hyperledger, we buy into the blockchain design pattern.""  Cuomo described Hyperledger as an exploration of the characteristics of blockchains, noting that all are shared ledgers that support transactions, and that have specific ways of enabling the replication of data across the network, as well as who can approve that data.  ""They all have these basic elements, they all have the same DNA, they just mutate the gene here and there,"" he added.  Stakeholder benefit  When asked how development teams representing public blockchain projects may benefit from participation in Hyperledger, Zemlin was less clear, stressing that those involved see a value in sharing ideas and bringing a mature technology to market.  ""I’m having conversations with all of them,"" Zemlin said. ""It’s not, 'If we don’t use my toys, then we’re going to go home.' I think they see a group of technologies trying to create an underlying platform.""  Cuomo said he sees all participants benefiting, even if the tokens that run on their public blockchains aren’t used prominently, as it would advance innovation on the concepts underlying a new type of technology.  ""I see bitcoin and Ripple as applications of blockchain. I think they would all benefit on some level, on doing some innovation on core blockchain,"" he said.  Cuomo went on to suggest that the Hyperledger Project itself would benefit from taking a longer view on the technology, one he believes could be used in everything from global supply chains to governmental social security programs.  ""The next-generation systems of record are going to be around for a long time,"" he continued. ""Looking at the pioneers, the bitcoins and Ethereums have done some nice work building on the applications, [but now] there’s an opportunity to step back.""  The comments are notable given the nature of public blockchain networks, in which holders of the tokens, or individual units of data that run on the protocols, are often considered by supporters as investment opportunities that may benefit from how their systems come to be used by enterprise business.  Notably, Ripple is not formally participating in the initiative as of yet, though it has donated code.  Ripple CEO Chris Larsen told CoinDesk:  ""We concluded that we didn’t feel [there was a] focused enough product use case yet.""  Single solution imminent  In addition to the accumulated code, Cuomo noted that Hyperledger has launched a website, Hyperledger.org, where information on the effort will continue to be made available.  ""Over the next couple weeks, we’re going to be putting together an architecture that puts the code into a solution. At that point, we already have information on the site, where people can read about blockchain for business. After that, they’ll be able to start downloading code for the foundation,"" he said.  As for how useable the code should be to end users given the youthfulness of the technology, Cuomo said users will still need some expertise.  Cuomo suggested that those using the code could even be involved in consortium models, such as those popularized by R3CEV, which has signed up more than 40 banks to develop its own ""Global Fabric for Finance"".  Likewise, Zemlin spoke to the need for neutral parties to help facilitate open-source development of such a system by managing communal trademarks and other assets.  The Hyperledger Project, for instance, is also composed of a Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which will evaluate code contributions, as well as an as-yet-unelected Governing Board that will manage the Hyperledger branding, which was donated by Digital Asset.  Value in open source  Both Zemlin and Cuomo alluded to the overall benefits open-source collaboration, citing past examples as evidence that Hyperledger could come to yield powerful technology.  For example, Zemlin noted that the mobile industry has embraced Android, with many of the participants in this platform contributing code that has come to have unforeseen benefits beyond initial expectations.  “[Android users] contributed code to the project to boost the battery power efficiency, and when they improved it, that same exact code was being used on high-performance computing systems [to reduce] millions of dollars in the cost of computing for data centers,” he said, adding:  ”I think that is what we’re going to see in an underlying fabric for the blockchain.”  Zemlin said he believes Hyperledger could come to support a new wave of exchange platforms and financial applications, but that a unified approach is needed to move these ideas forward.  In this light, he likened the initiative to a drive to create an iPhone that could come to support a variety of blockchains as plentiful as today's apps.  Cuomo, in turn, said that the vision was to create an effort where companies could ""plug value"" into the platform after it is established.  Still, Zemlin alluded to the somewhat opaque nature of public statements on blockchain in general, in which entities seem to suggest they can ""say ledger and blockchain"" and ""wave a wand"" to produce a solution.  Zemlin concluded:  ""I don’t think that’s the case here. You wouldn’t get 30 organizations with a lot of visibility and clout in the world from the tech sector if there wasn’t something here, and [participants] that understand the opportunity.""
