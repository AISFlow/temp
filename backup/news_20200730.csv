42384274,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAERov,1596138887,Social Media Companies Are 'Too Big to Fail',"Jenny Leung is a blockchain and fintech attorney at Blakemore Fallon PLLC dba Ketsal.      This year, 2020, is the year social media institutions became systemically important.      This term, “systemically important,” typically describes a financial institution whose failure poses a significant threat to the economy and is thus ""too big to fail."" Systemically important financial institutions (“SIFI”) have been subject to additional regulatory scrutiny.    If certain social media institutions were to fail today, their failure would pose a significant threat to society due to their outsized influence, size, reach, society’s co-dependence on them and “their power to shape the interpretation of public events.”https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-preventing-online-censorship/ These systemically important social media institutions (“SISMI”) have become so influential and embedded in society their failure may cause the economy to suffer.    But that doesn’t necessarily mean the solution is as simple as building decentralized alternatives, as some technologists have suggested, or pursuing antitrust action, as outlined in Wednesday’s congressional investigation into Big Tech’s anti-competitive behavior. The threats go much deeper than that.      See also: Michael Casey – CoinDesk’s Twitter Hack Proved the Media Can’t Rely on Web 2.0      Recent phenomena highlighted SISMI’s helpful influence during the COVID-19 pandemic: the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement and the Twitter hack of July 2020. Society now depends on SISMIs to keep businesses and influencers afloat, to support political movements, to document protests and police brutality, to livestream everything from yoga classes to conferences, to provide live tornado warnings, to break news, to propagate political rallies, to expose violent rioters, to hold police accountable and to render a verdict as to what company, product or person should be “canceled.”      During the pandemic, the reliance on SISMIs has grown as businesses shut their doors, switched to online delivery and online streaming and requested virtual donations to keep them alive. As New York City found itself paralyzed under Pause and Curfew, I found myself turning to Instagram and Facebook for updates when neither Google Maps' opening hours nor Seamless were reliable. I was glued to the Citizen App for live updates as the protests marched through my neighborhood and past my doorstep.      At the same time, we've seen violent crimes livestreamed, genocide incited, non-consensual harvesting of personal data for political advertising, doxing of viral subjects, financial scams and, more recently, the hacking of prominent social media accounts – all through the very same platforms.    Despite its growing importance, ‘social media inclusion’ doesn’t quite have the ring of ‘financial inclusion.’    As confirmed by Twitter itself, hackers took control of 45 accounts, including those of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Elon Musk, Kim Kardashian and Vitalik Buterin, and sent tweets that tricked followers into sending bitcoin to the hacker’s bitcoin address. While only 12.87 bitcoin (approximately $142,000 at press time) had been sent, the real dangers lie in the fact that (1) hackers gained site-wide admin access and tweeted publicly from prominent accounts with global reach and (2) the hackers were able to access and download potentially sensitive unencrypted direct messages.      See also: Brenna Smith – Last Week’s Big Twitter Hack Was Years in the Making      These events highlight society’s increasing dependency on mega-platforms for matters ranging from business to finance, justice and politics. We may approach a situation where a political figure has a voice across every social media platform but their opponent may have been banned on the same influential platforms, with no formal appeal process available. As Zoomers, raised on social media, begin to reach voting age, the banning or censoring of political figures and public events may become a real issue as SISMIs engage in more active censorship and control.      Despite its growing importance, “social media inclusion” doesn’t quite have the ring of “financial inclusion.”      Bitcoin and decentralized finance applications have been gaining traction on the principle that everyone in the world deserves access to financial services. It may only be a matter of time before an unstoppable, decentralized and workable social media platform provides everyone with the ability to have a voice.    What next?    If social media institutions have become systemically important, governments, regulators and political leaders should recognize how tightly intertwined SISMIs have become with society and the economy and acknowledge the risks that come with this marriage.      Some pundits noted the Twitter hackers could have started a war between world leaders, incited violence, manipulated the markets or created social panic. The latter actually occurred in 2013 after hackers tweeted from the account of the Associated Press, saying the White House had been hit by two explosions and that President Obama was injured, sending the U.S. stock market into freefall. We almost saw history repeat when the Twitter hackers actually hijacked Barack Obama’s Twitter account earlier this month.      See also: Nathaniel Whittemore – No, the Twitter Hack Wasn’t About Bitcoin      Are we ready for a world economy dominated by SISMIs? Imagine a stock or crypto market driven by viral posts and TikTok memes, celebrities and corporate personalities, “coin of the day” posts or trends rooted in irrational exuberance.      Once SISMIs pose a bigger threat to the economy than SIFIs (whether directly through markets or indirectly through civil unrest), it may already be too late to be cautious about their influence. While Wednesday’s congressional antitrust hearing was a good start, the issue of antitrust is only one item in a growing list of problems. Whether the solution is more regulation, breaking up SISMIs, making social media decentralized or treating SISMIs like SIFIs is a conversation for another day.      I simply propose we open our eyes to their economic and societal influence.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Jenny Leung,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/30/social-media-companies-are-too-big-to-fail,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c160216ee277c7fa371b4f1c9bdd11807d33535-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384260,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA6sqX,1596129622,"Audius Rallies EDM Artists, Crypto VCs to Back Vision for Music Payments on Ethereum","Music is back on the blockchain.      Audius, a streaming service that connects music fans directly with artists, has raised $3.1 million in a strategic round co-led by Multicoin Capital and Blockchange Ventures, with participation from Pantera Capital and Coinbase Ventures.      Audius has now raised a total of $8.6 million as the platform prepares for prime time, having grown in less than a year to over 250,000 monthly users and 40,000 artists. EDM artists seem to be the site’s burgeoning specialty with notables including RAC, deadmau5, Lido, 3LAU, Zeds Dead, Mr. Carmack and REZZ all signed on.      The blockchain use case for music is a familiar one: the inequity and tardiness of the revenue model of streaming services like Apple Music and Spotify.      “It shouldn’t take a year and a half to get paid, and it’s just crazy that the people creating the music only take 12%,” Audius CEO Roneil Rumburg said in an interview. “After this extreme time delay, the artist just gets this check, so they don’t actually see who’s listening to them. There is no visibility because the artist doesn’t own their own data or their audience.”      The Audius P2P network allows artists to be paid in full by their fans, directly and instantly for every stream with the ability to cash out daily or hourly if they want, Rumburg added.    ‘Fair trade’ but for music    Ethereum-based Audius picks up the mantle carried by ConsenSys-backed Ujo Music and groundbreaking projects like Imogen Heap’s Mycelia, which the artist described as “fair trade” music.      Indeed, folks such as Jesse Grushack, co-founder and CEO of the now-shuttered Ujo Music, have helped and advised Audius, as has Ujo’s former artist-in-residence, André Allen Anjos, better known by his stage name RAC, a Grammy Award winner who has remixed the likes of New Order, Lady Gaga and the Kings of Leon.      Anjos, who worked with Ujo for over a year and released an album on Ethereum, said the problem was the complexity of onboarding users.      “We used to kind of joke that it could take like 36 steps to get ether into MetaMask,” Anjos said in an interview. “Just to interact with these systems you needed to go through this crazy setup, and I think Ujo kind of suffered from that. But today, if you go to Audius it’s a pretty similar experience to any other platform, arguably better. That initial barrier to entry is not a problem anymore.”      Audius, which was founded in 2018 by Stanford University buddies Rumburg and Chief Product Officer Forrest Browning, has benefitted from “a kind of diaspora of talent that had already been working on this problem,” said Rumburg.      “Back in 2016, when these projects came about, was just really early,” he said. “The amount of stuff that [ConsenSys founder] Joe [Lubin] had to build from scratch was just this astronomical ask.”      The Audius team may have built the music player with a user interface that looks and feels like Spotify or SoundCloud, but it couldn’t be more different under the hood.    Decentralized streaming    The network consists of indexing nodes, which provide a discovery service, and content-posting or creator nodes. This intersection of fans, artists and infrastructure providers who host and index content (“stakers” in blockchain parlance), uses both the Ethererum public blockchain (which is where all the staking and look-up nodes are running) and a second, permissioned network where the uploaded content lives.      “It’s fully community-operated and hosted,” said Rumburg. “Today, if we shut down Audius, the company, all of this could keep working and keep running so long as the community wants to keep it up and running.”      Following on from a minimum viable product mainnet launch in the next couple of months, the next stage is to add instant payments for monetized content, which will use a system of stablecoins and be in place before the end of the year, said Rumburg.      “Payments will be done with a kind of stablecoin mechanism. So that’s not like an Audius native token, but a basket of third-party tokens. It’ll probably be a couple of the bigger ones,” he said. “We're looking for good fiat to crypto on-ramp options. From the user’s perspective, they don't even know this is happening. They just put in a credit card and top up that account and see a balance.”      The user interface for artists is just as simple, said Audius CPO Forrest Browning.      “As an artist, if you decide to monetize some of your content, your Audius dashboard might show you have $500 or whatever is your local currency, and with a one-click direct deposit you can pull that out, without knowing a stable token system was integrated,” Browning said.    Deep cuts    Music distribution on the internet has moved on since the time of Napster, but when an artist is signed to a label the label owns the rights to the artist’s master copies and gets to decide where that content is distributed. There seems to be more opportunity for negotiation these days, particularly between artists and forward-thinking independent labels.      “The majority of our usage right now is coming from independent artists who are not signed,” said Rumburg. “Those that are signed to progressive labels have gone and got permission from their label. I think the mentality is, the sooner you sign up to a system like this, the more following and momentum you build, similar to early accounts on SoundCloud or anything else like that.”      RAC, who is signed to iconic U.K. indie label Ninja Tune, said the conversation about him releasing an album on Ethereum back in 2017 was “very easygoing,” because the label is tech savvy.      “The way to go is obviously to ask the label for permission, but I feel like it would be a non-issue in most cases. I think most labels would say, ‘Why not?’ and just approach this as another distribution platform,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/30/audius-rallies-edm-artists-crypto-vcs-to-back-vision-for-music-payments-on-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91070e2d6126483e3e588535c853487b53b113b3-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Hello, Shelley Cardano is now running a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Announced Wednesday, the open-source smart-contract platform designed to challenge Ethereum's lead position, hard-forked from the centralized Byron network into the decentralized Shelley network. IOHK, the lead design firm, said ""hundreds"" of assets are expected to run on the blockchain in a year's time. The PoS delegation process lets users holding Cardano's native token (ADA) commit their tokens to a pool for a share of rewards. A number of additional upgrades and improvements are expected in the coming months, including a new governance model, Project Catalyst.      Ponzi Popped Chinese police have arrested all 27 primary suspects thought to be responsible for running the $5.7 billion Plus Token Ponzi scheme. Led by the Ministry of Public Security, China's top police force agency, the investigators has also arrested another 82 core members of the scheme in what looks like the first crackdown on an international, crypto Ponzi. The scheme allegedly scammed two million people by using cryptocurrencies including bitcoin as a funding channel.      Public Backdoor Newly launched derivatives platform EQUOS.io is set to become the first publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S. through a “backdoor listing” on Nasdaq later this year. Its operator, Hong Kong-based Diginex, announced Thursday it is combining EQUOS.io with the Nasdaq-listed Singapore’s 8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp – a special-purpose acquisition company. SPACs are shell companies that use funds from their IPOs to acquire target companies, bringing them public through the “backdoor,” a process that is faster and cheaper than traditional listings, according to Diginex CEO Richard Byworth.      Cuts & Capital Security token platform tZERO has cut staff and salaries as it eyes another capital raise. CEO Saum Noursalehi said tZERO had ""significantly reduced"" its cash burn rate 45% year on year by cutting legal costs and staff and trimming executive salaries in exchange for company equity. A majority-owned subsidiary of Overstock, tZERO raised $134 million in a 2018 ICO – short of its $250 million target – and secured $5 million investment from Chinese fund GoldenSands Capital in April.      Bit by Bit Binance launched a new Australian fiat-to-crypto exchange platform Wednesday that CoinDesk has discovered is run by the founders of a company providing crypto payment services for the local tourist industry. A spokesperson said Binance Australia was a separate entity from the main exchange group, and operated by InvestbyBit, a Queensland-based private company and a licensed Australian digital currency exchange. Through InvestbyBit, Binance Australia is registered with AUSTRAC, one of the country's primary financial enforcement agencies, the spokesperson added. As the name suggests, InvestbyBit has close ties to TravelbyBit, a crypto payment provider for the tourist industry in which Binance invested $2.5 million in late 2018.

At stake    Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee held an investigation into anti-competitive practices at Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.      Documents and testimony gave a window into hostile business practices and a business environment where these four U.S.-based firms could crush, buy or steal from startups. This isn’t news. In 2011, it was revealed Google was buying one company a week. It’s market consolidation, not meant to help consumers but an attempt to maintain corporate control over data flows and innovation.      Many, like The Verge’s Casey Newton, criticized the hearing for going widely off-topic, including tangents into conspiracy theories, and generally avoiding the topic of tech innovation. But he still walked away with the sense the federal government is ready to pursue meaningful antitrust action.      “Members of the subcommittee have largely come to believe, as I do, that tech companies have grown too powerful and are in need of regulation,” he wrote.      It’s a sentiment that’s percolating through the small subset of tech called crypto. Coin Center’s Jerry Brito tweeted midway through the hearing, “Repeat after me: Antitrust law exists to protect consumers, not competitors.”      While Elizabeth Renieris, founder of Hackylawer, shot off a succinct Shoshana Zuboff quote: ""Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data.""      Crypto got wise to Big Tech’s chokehold over the internet early. Instead of waiting for government-led action, technologists and developers started building ways to exit the system.      While these systems are still niche, they offer an alternative to both the public and “private governments” that Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have become.    Market intel    Overbought or Overwrought? With bitcoin rising to its highest level in 11 months this week, some investors are beginning to worry that the cryptocurrency is overbought and may be due for notable price drop. Bitcoin’s price rose to $11,319 on Monday, the highest level since August 2019, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. The sudden rally has pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) above 80.00, a number indicating the bullish move may be overstretched. Asim Ahmad, co-chief investment officer at London-based Eterna Capital, said that an above-70 RSI does not necessarily imply an impending major price slide.      In the Green About 93% of all bitcoin address balances were estimated to be “in profit,” according to Glassnode, when bitcoin traded above $11,000 Wednesday. The metric measures the on-paper profits of wallet balances. More than 90% of bitcoin addresses were last in profit through July and August 2019 when bitcoin traded around $11,500, a local top for the leading cryptocurrency. The 11-month high for in-profit addresses came amid bitcoin’s rally to $11,400 and follows steady long-term accumulation by investors at lower prices, with fewer than 40% of all bitcoins having been moved in the past year.      Frozen Fed Moves Zero Degrees The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it would hold benchmark U.S. interest rates close to zero (in range between 0% and 0.25%) and continue buying Treasury bonds to support the coronavirus-devastated economy. The ""path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus,"" it said. Not said at the press conference: Another $5 billion of freshly created money was injected into financial markets, based on the $80 billion of bond purchases that the Fed is conducting every month to keep financial markets functioning smoothly as the fast-spreading coronavirus devastates the global economy, according to First Mover.

Tech pod    $500M in Fees A new study from Bitcoin startup Veriphi finds companies and users sending bitcoin transactions could have saved more than $500 million in fees if everyone had used SegWit and a technique called transaction batching. SegWit, a 2017 update to Bitcoin, allows for more space for transactions per block, and transaction batching enables the sending of multiple transactions at once to cut down on paying for each individual transaction. The average fee costs about $3 per transaction, but increases with demand and transaction volume.      Autonomous Aave Aave is going fully autonomous – transferring ownership of the money protocol to a “genesis governance” built and approved by token holders. Formerly EthLend, the platform raised a $16.2 million initial coin offering in 2017, and launched as a peer-to-peer lending protocol. It has since renamed and switched to a pooled protocol that allows for more dynamic asset listings, network liquidity and variable interest rates. Launched January 2020, Aave was among the first to include the novel DeFi product flash loans, and now has plans to incorporate liquidity mining.    Opinion    Lightning Round Richard Myers, a decentralized applications engineer at goTenna’s Global Mesh Labs initiative, thinks as long as people are paying for internet connectivity in fiat, online censorship is inevitable. “As long as telecommunications tools are being paid for in fiat, they will never be free from governmental or corporate repression. To be truly censorship resistant, internet publishers must be able to accept anonymous payments from their subscribers and advertisers,” he said.    Podcast    DeFi Disruptor Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov appeared on the latest episode of The Breakdown to discuss his life’s work: disrupting traditional finance. “Imagine a world without counterparty risk…” he said.

According to a post on SSU’s Facebook page, two 60-year-old men posted a paper note on an apartment building in Kyiv threatening to blow up that building or another one if they didn’t receive 50 BTC to their bitcoin address.      To prove they were serious, the alleged terrorists detonated a small bomb near a subway station on July 21 and then called the police twice, reporting bombs were planted in other locations in Kyiv, and that those actions were related to the explosion near the subway station.      After analyzing cell phone data and street camera footage, the SSU detained two suspects.      “Despite their advanced age, they learned how various criminals have been using crypto and hoped to avoid punishment after getting money in a digital wallet,” wrote Anton Herashchenko, deputy minister at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs, on his Facebook page.      The bitcoin wallet address on the threat notice has only one incoming transaction on record, receiving 0.00012258 BTC on July 22 from an unknown address. According to data from Crystal Blockchain transaction tracing software, the money came to the wallet from the LocalBitcoins marketplace via nine hops through other addresses, including several transactions to the Russian dark market Hydra.

The Coinbase-backed decentralized finance startup is adding token-exchange protocol Uniswap as its latest in-app offering. In addition to earning “interest” on Ethereum stablecoins, Dharma users will now be able to trade any ERC-20 token for another.      “This continues our strategy of building Dharma as the gateway to doing the important things in DeFi,” co-founder Brendan Forster said in an interview.      With only tens of thousands of active users by most estimates, the $3.8 billion DeFi market is still niche.

Dharma’s approach is notable in that it puts DeFi’s oft-touted “money Lego” meme into practice.      “Dharma now supports the three core money services,” explained Forster. “Savings and yield via Compound, investing and trading via Uniswap and peer-to-peer payments.”      The app wants to be both consumer-friendly and non-custodial, in keeping with DeFi’s “trustless” ethos, he added.      “Our goal in building ‘the Robinhood of crypto’ is to bridge the final gap between these blossoming markets and the millions of individuals who will want to tap into them as they gain popularity and mindshare,” CEO Nadav Hollander said in a statement.

In the last week, ether has established a foothold above $300 for the first time in 12 months.  While the second-largest cryptocurrency is trading with only a relatively small price increase year on year, the number of profit-making or “in the money” ether addresses has more than doubled to 31.37 million from 13.5 million over that time, according to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock.  The numbers indicate many took advantage of the opportunity to buy ether under $300, resulting in almost 18 million more in-profit addresses – a rise of 132%.  The majority of the buying may have happened following the cryptocurrency’s dips to levels near $100 in December 2019 and March 2020.  An address is said to be in the money if the current price of the token is higher than the average cost at which the coins were acquired or sent to the address.  It's worth noting that individuals and entities can own more than one address, so the 18 million figure does not represent investor numbers.  While in-the-money addresses have more than doubled year on year, the total number of addresses showing a balance has also risen by 55%, up 15.5 million from 28.11 million last July.  With the two metrics showing such different levels of growth, IntoTheBlock suggested that some holders – addresses with a balance a year ago – opted to bring their average cost down by buying dips below $300.  Ethereum’s network has recently witnessed some of its busiest days since the beginning of 2020 due to increased issuance of stablecoins and solid growth in Defi projects on the network.

42384247,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA6sdx,1596119484,Central Banks Are Privacy Providers of Last Resort,"J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and is a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.      Have central banks quietly pivoted to becoming consumer privacy advocates?      It certainly seems like it. Back in 2017, Denmark's central bank proclaimed it would ""not be appropriate or acceptable"" to issue an anonymous digital currency for public use. But a recent Bank of Canada paper floats the idea of issuing digital currency with ""enhanced privacy features."" It's almost as if over the last 24 months central bankers have become bitcoiners (or at least zcashers).      I think this advocacy is probably a good thing. But it's still in the early stages. Who knows where it will lead?      See also: JP Koning - Venezuela Is a Testing Ground for Digital Dollarization (and Zelle Doesn’t Like It)      Central bankers have always been a bit sheepish about the role they play in providing payments privacy. Banknotes, a central bank monopoly, are widely used by people from all walks of life. But they are particularly vital to folks in the criminal and underground economies who need to cover their tracks. That's not the sort of customer base one brags about.      Criminals are no longer the only anonymity-seekers, however. Regular folks in the licit economy are increasingly fretting about their financial privacy. As more and more of our payments are being pulled into the digital world, where they can be preyed on by data sniffing corporations and governments, we want protection.      Banknotes are one of the few ways to control how much of our personal data gets thrown off to these sniffers. And so central bankers have found themselves accidentally thrust into the role as foremost provider of ""retail"" financial privacy.      Now, central bankers are tentatively taking the next steps. Rather than accidentally performing the role, why not formally adopt a proactive approach to protecting individuals' financial privacy?    Privacy as public good    While it's hard to pin down when the shift began, it might might have been in 2018 when Christine Lagarde, the outgoing head of the International Monetary Fund, dared suggest that if central banks are to issue their own digital money, one of the public policy goals worth considering should be ""privacy in payments.""      More than anything else, the debate over whether to issue a so-called central bank digital currency, or CBDC, is driving this nascent mandate. Designing something from scratch is forcing central banks to ask themselves whether they have an obligation to provide the public with digital privacy and, if so, how private dare they make the stuff.      Luckily for today's CBDC architects, the intellectual basis for privacy in payments has been laid out long ago. Many CoinDesk readers will be familiar with the group of irreverent cypherpunks active in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s who debated the merits of electronic cash. This includes the likes of David Chaum, Hal Finney and eventually Satoshi Nakamoto.    Does a 'balanced' approach to privacy mean a CBDC backdoor for government law enforcement? Many of us would bristle at this.    The debate over privacy and CBDC actually draws from a second and less-known stream of thinkers associated with the U.S. Federal Reserve. They are Charles Kahn, James McAndrews and William Roberds. Starting with a shared interest in central bank clearing and settlement systems, this trio of economists began to explore financial privacy in 2000 with ""A Theory of Transactions Privacy."" In that paper they suggested the ""dark side"" of the information revolution was ""a concomitant loss of privacy,"" and developed an economic model to determine the scope of the problem.      The work of Kahn, McAndrews and Roberds consistently highlights the economic benefits of payment privacy – and not just for criminals. If information from licit transactions can be exploited, say because it might land participants on a marketer's bothersome mailing list, legitimate buyers or sellers may decide to not make the transaction at all. And so the economy fails to operate at full capacity.      The three economists suggested the existence of a privacy-friendly payments rail might empower consumers by letting them guard their personal information. And so a payment that might have otherwise been deemed too dangerous could proceed. More trade makes the world better off.      Through their work, Kahn, McAndrews and Roberds have created a language that, almost two decades later, is finally being drawn upon by central bankers. Citing this earlier work, economists Rodney Garrat and Maarten van Oordt have recently suggested in a Bank of Canada staff paper that payments privacy might be thought of as a public good.      See also: ‘Radical Indifference’: How Surveillance Capitalism Conquered Our Lives      What does it mean to say that privacy is a public good? A useful analogy might be a strategy of wearing masks to combat COVID-19. The main reason to wear a mask is not necessarily to protect oneself but to protect others from the virus. The net result, a healthy population, makes everyone better off. Likewise with privacy. By choosing to take on the hassle of preserving one's privacy when making purchases, an individual makes it harder for a snoop to use the data to exploit others.      Garratt's and van Oordt's public good argument for privacy was recently cited by Sriram Darbha and Rakesh Arora, two Bank of Canada researchers. They have written a technical overview on how a CBDC might incorporate privacy. It lists a number of techniques including zero-knowledge proofs, the technology that drives privacy coin zcash.      Dharba and Arora mention the idea of a “hybrid privacy” in their paper. Whenever central bankers opine on the issue of privacy and CBDC they have generally been careful to strike a balance between providing privacy and guarding against bad actors. ""Would central banks jump to the rescue and offer a fully anonymous digital currency?"" asked Christine Lagarde in 2018. ""Certainly not. Doing so would be a bonanza for criminals.""      Darbha and Arora also take this balanced approach. Under “hybrid privacy,"" a potential CBDC might allow ""maximum privacy"" to users within limits. But anything above a fixed amount would no longer be protected. And so presumably organized crime would be kept away from using the system.      It's difficult to know for sure whether a central banker's ""balanced"" approach to privacy will meet the bar that is being set by an emerging group of privacy consumers. Jerry Brito, executive director for Coin Center and a frequent commentator on digital privacy, suggests that a CBDC should be ""as private as possible. By that I mean as anonymous as physical cash.""      There are costs to this degree of anonymity, grants Brito. But officials can work to control abuses using the same regime they have developed for dealing with the abuse of cash, for instance requiring reporting for all payments over $10,000.      Will central bankers be willing to go this far and, if so, will regulators of money laundering allow them?      Does a ""balanced"" approach to privacy mean a CBDC backdoor for government law enforcement? Many of us would bristle at this – we've all read Edward Snowdon’s revelations about the National Security Agency’s abuses. Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation, is skeptical, telling me it is ""unreasonable to expect the U.S. government to build a CBDC system that doesn't have a backdoor into all transactions.""    Complex project    But let’s imagine for a moment that a central bank does issue a genuinely anonymous digital currency, one with no backdoors. Why would the public believe it? The privacy technology is likely to be kept under the hood. And even if we could see underneath, the code would be gibberish to most of us.      Darbha and Arora suggest trust could be enhanced using ""third-party reviews."" But in an age where trust is in short supply, might we need a fourth party to review the third party? A fifth to review the fourth? This daisy chain can go on forever.      Another challenge will be to build a large enough base of CBDC users to harness Garratt's and van Oordt's public good nature of privacy. Return for a moment to our mask analogy. Even if there are plenty of masks to go around, it doesn't mean enough people will use them. And so the virus wins.      See also: JP Koning - How Bitcoin Is Like Ham Radio      Likewise with privacy. Even if the central bank provides the public top-notch privacy, many people will probably just stick with their credit card. And thus none of the public benefits of privacy emerge. The snoops win. I suppose that CBDC usage could be legally mandated, but that seems a step too far.      So, as you can see, a privacy-friendly CBDC is a complex and ambitious project. I applaud central bankers for taking the initial steps forward. But part of me worries they may be biting off more than they can chew.      Which gets us back to Charles Kahn, who suggests what might be an easier role for central bankers. Rather than becoming directly involved in issuing digital anonymous money, perhaps central bankers should just regulate and standardize financial anonymity. That would leave the private sector to meet the public’s various privacy needs, under the central bank's watchful eye. And leave central bankers less subject to criticism.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/30/central-banks-are-privacy-providers-of-last-resort,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5df368ae6a86e7063e1eebd7f4bf82b15dca225b-1700x1133.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42384256,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA6slV,1596118393,Bank of England Building Payments Network to Support a Potential Digital Pound,"The Bank of England's upcoming settlement service is being designed to support a possible central bank digital currency (CBDC).    CoinDesk has learned the BoE will ensure its redesigned real-time gross settlement service (RTGS), the payments network used by U.K. financial institutions, can be forwards compatible with CBDCs, such as a digital pound.  The new settlements system is being designed that the bank could ""bolt on"" a facility for digital currency transactions, should it decide to support a CBDC.  Modules for other future capabilities, as well as the digital pound, are also being considered for the upcoming settlement system.  RTGS is a key component in the U.K.'s financial infrastructure – it's where institutions hold their sterling accounts and acts as the main channel for the BoE to inject liquidity into the economy.  On average, RTGS settles more than £685 billion ($900 billion) worth of transactions each working day.  The BoE announced Thursday it had chosen Irish tech consultancy firm Accenture for a £150 million ($195 million) contract to redesign the payments network.  In a statement, Accenture said the new RTGS system would adapt to the changing financial system by providing access to more firms, as well as greater interoperability and functionality.  The new RTGS system is expected to go live in 2022.  Earlier this month, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said the 400-year-old central bank was seriously considering whether to launch a CBDC.  Officials have previously said the BoE was open to the idea of private companies having a greater role in the issuance of a digital pound, insofar that they stick to the bank's design and policy principles.

42384257,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA6sml,1596115868,"China Aims to Be the World’s Dominant Blockchain Power – With Help From Google, Amazon and Microsoft","The Takeaway:    China's blockchain infrastructure BSN is set to provide global access to its services next month.  The network’s reliance on U.S. cloud service providers makes it vulnerable to geopolitical risks.  Rising tension between the U.S. and China over the last several months could increase such risks.  China's developments in other technology areas have already met with resistance from the U.S. government.    A state-backed blockchain infrastructure project from China aims to be the dominant internet services provider for decentralized applications (dapps). Its first-mover advantage is significant, as are the geopolitical risks.      The project, called the Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN), is expanding globally as U.S.-China relations become increasingly tense. BSN is a Chinese state-sanctioned blockchain project, but few may realize the network is supported by U.S. technology companies.      Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft and Google are among the major cloud service providers for BSN’s overseas data centers.      This arrangement is notable, given the U.S. government’s hawkishness on Chinese technology. The Trump administration is considering a ban on Chinese social media app Tik Tok, Congress approved $1 billion for rural telecom carriers to ditch services from Huawei and the U.S. Commerce Department restricted semiconductor companies from providing chips to Huawei.      At Wednesday's House antitrust hearing, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg painted the China-U.S. tech competition as a zero-sum game. According to Zuckerberg, “China is building its own version of the internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting their vision to other countries.”      This charged environment could potentially spell trouble for BSN. “China tries to grab the lead in blockchain and dominate this domain and that may end up putting this BSN project further into the spotlight of the U.S.-China tech competition,” said Paul Triolo, practice head of geotechnology at Eurasia Group.      “This would be the perception in places like Washington,” he added.      U.S.-China technology competition has been ongoing for decades, but the focus is shifting from search engines and social media to more fundamental levels of technology like telecom equipment provided by Huawei, Triolo said.      Tension between the U.S. and China reached fever pitch earlier this month as the U.S. shut down the Chinese consulate in Houston and China took over the U.S. consulate in Chengdu in retaliation. In a recent speech, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo slammed U.S.-China engagement as a failure.      It’s unclear whether these tensions will calm in the near future, even if a new U.S. president is elected.      “Even if we get a new administration in the U.S., for example, under [former Vice President and Democratic nominee Joseph] Biden, there is still going to be a lot of scrutiny on China from the technology front,” Triolo said.      There is a real risk that technology that doesn’t present a national security risk will nonetheless be banned because of politics, said Graham Webster, China digital economy fellow at New America, a think-tank with a focus on public policy issues.      Amazon, Google and Microsoft did not return requests for comment by press time.    Containment    One way to limit Chinese tech companies from growing and developing global services is to pressure their suppliers to sever ties with them.      The U.S. prohibited Huawei’s major provider – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) – from using American tools to make chips if it produces any product for Huawei. The Chinese company denounced the move as a “pernicious decision.”      BSN could potentially end up in a similar situation, given the prominence of American firms as its overseas data center hosts.      The Chinese network does not build or own any of the data centers where it runs its technical infrastructure; 90% of BSN’s domestic data centers are provided by the telecom company China Mobile. Most overseas data centers will be provided by Amazon’s AWS, given the scope of the cloud services provider’s operations across the globe, according to BSN.      BSN pays these cloud services providers to use their servers and integrates the servers with their software.      Read more: Inside China’s Plan to Power Global Blockchain Adoption      The network has two data centers hosted by AWS in China. It also uses a few global data centers built on Microsoft’s cloud computing arm and Google Cloud Platform. BSN has one data center from Google Cloud based in Tokyo, one from Microsoft in Johannesburg and two from AWS in Paris and California.      Dapp developers can more quickly and easily access services from BSN if they use a data center that is physically close to them. That's why overseas data centers are crucial in terms of providing internet services for the global blockchain community.      “If I were the Chinese company, I would be careful about setting up a system that really depends on continued services in the U.S.,” Webster said. “Anybody who wants to use the global version of this Chinese network should take into account the risk that a data center in the U.S. could get taken off the network because of geopolitics.”      One motivation for curbing Chinese tech companies’ global expansion is data security concerns.      Blockchain technology clearly provides a structurally unusual level of security and integrity, but there is a battle going on over data localization and cloud services, said James Mulnevon, director of intelligence integration at SOS International, a Washington, D.C.-based defense and intelligence company that supports U.S. government agencies.      “The world is clearly becoming a ‘splinternet’ with national boundaries and domestic regulations overturning the previous ‘techno globalism’ motif,” Mulnevon said.      U.S. cloud providers offer services to a wide range of clients and it is hard to tell what specific cyber security concerns would exist if they allow Chinese companies to use their services, Webster said.    No immediate threat    So far, BSN’s global expansion has not met with challenges from U.S. regulators, perhaps because it is relatively new. Or maybe it’s just that few Washington lawmakers can actually make sense of it.      “Part of the reason that BSN has not met with challenges from the U.S. policy makers as the other emerging technologies such as 5G and artificial intelligence is that blockchain technology is not well understood,” Triolo said.      The U.S. government is considering restricting Chinese cloud services companies from operating in the U.S., but has yet to address the question of U.S. companies hosting applications that have a China connection.      Last May, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) denied China Mobile’s application to operate telecommunications services in the U.S. This could mean Chinese businesses trying to build cloud-based networks in the U.S. need to be aware of the geopolitical risk, said James Mulvenon, director of Intelligence Integration at SOS International, a DC-based defense and intelligence firm.      “I would be wary about big investments in these kinds of transnational cloud networks because regulators seem very grumpy about them right now,” Mulvenon said.      Read more: Meet Red Date, the Little-Known Tech Firm Behind China’s Big Blockchain Vision      Lawmakers who do have concerns might be reassured by the fact that even if the Chinese government does ask for data from BSN nodes hosted overseas, it may not be able to get it.      The Chinese government has a very expansive view of extraterritoriality, Mulnevon said.      “The Chinese government certainly believes that Chinese companies operating abroad (even when they are incorporated abroad) are subject to Chinese law,” he said.      Theoretically, the Chinese government would solicit data from a Chinese company like the one behind BSN regardless of where it is run, meaning it could ask for data stored in the network’s overseas data centers. However, Red Date, the tech firm that architected BSN’s technical framework, has claimed the network does not have access to user data, due to its technical structure.      Red Date CEO Yifan He previously told CoinDesk that BSN’s technical framework fully protects its users’ data privacy and functions like an adapter that better connects developers with data centers where they can run nodes and build applications. He even invited skeptics to examine the network’s code for themselves.    The China connection    The BSN Development Association is led by the State Information Center of China (SIC), a public institution under the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the highest economic planning committee in China. State-owned tech conglomerates China Mobile and China UnionPay are also deeply involved in building the network.      It is certainly rare to get a government affiliate to endorse and lead the effort for a large-scale blockchain infrastructure, and for two of the largest Chinese tech giants to support the network. However, unlike China’s national digital currency, higher-level government agencies such as the Chinese central bank and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China (MIIT) do not appear to be involved in BSN yet.      The precise nature of the relationship between the Chinese government and BSN is not clear. But given BSN’s state connection, its reliance on major U.S. cloud services providers could be a point of contention on the Chinese side as well.      “No foreign firms sit on any BSN leadership committees. As stated in official documents, Beijing intends for BSN to be a ‘global infrastructure network autonomously innovated by Chinese entities,’” according to a May report from Eurasia Group.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/30/china-aims-to-be-the-worlds-dominant-blockchain-power-with-help-from-google-amazon-and-microsoft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/576e0532fd63ee026a84c8e4186c20defc463260-1500x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384248,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA6sYv,1596114000,Circle Gets $25M From DCG to Drive USDC Mainstream,"USDC backer Circle is teaming with Genesis Trading in a $25 million deal aimed at pushing the stablecoin to the fintech masses.      Announced Wednesday, the funding comes from Genesis parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), which, full disclosure, also owns CoinDesk.      The new partnership and funding will enhance Circle’s suite of products, and launch some new ones too, the companies said. It’s all geared toward additional USDC yield and lending services with a view toward mainstream adoption.      “We’re seeing the evolution from stablecoins as something that’s exclusively been in the crypto capital markets to really moving into a broader set of use cases in payments and commerce and financial applications around the world,” Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said in an interview. “The logical evolution is that lending markets built on stablecoins are going to grow significantly.”      Read more: Circle CEO Claims ‘Explosive’ Stablecoin Demand From Everyday Businesses      Dollar stablecoins are on a roll, with about 12 billion now in circulation. Out of the stablecoin cohort, USDC has shone in recent months, growing from just over 400 million in early 2020 to around 1.1 billion today.      Meanwhile, Genesis originated more than $2 billion in crypto loans in Q1 2020, and more than $8 billion since launching the business in March 2018. The broker has seen a marked increase in the percentage of USDC within its loan portfolio, said Genesis CEO Michael Moro.      “Look at the interest rates that various lending platforms like ours have been paying people just to buy and hold crypto, in addition to the price move in the crypto itself,” said Moro. “Now compare that to interest rates in the U.S., as well as negative interest rates abroad. With a 10-year Treasury note, we’re looking at 65, 70 basis points a year, versus being able to earn 8% potentially on your crypto, including stablecoins.”    Doubling down    Looking back, Circle has raised $246 million over seven funding rounds, with DCG being a regular investor in the company as far back as early 2014. The USDC stablecoin was born in October 2018 out of a partnership between Circle and San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase, dubbed the CENTRE Consortium.      Allaire could not say specifically if Genesis or anyone else might be joining the CENTRE consortium soon, but he did say expansion plans are afoot.      “Right now, Circle and Coinbase are the two members of the CENTRE consortium, and what I call the board of managers for the governance of the stablecoin standard itself,” said Allaire. “We are going to be expanding ecosystem participation in CENTRE and involving a far broader range of participants in the direction of USDC as a standard.”    DeFi vs. CeFi    Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending is all the rage right now, and stablecoins like USDC are being sucked onto platforms such as Compound and Maker at a rapid pace, which presents something of a contrast to the more traditional world of crypto lending.      Read more: MakerDAO Adds USDC as DeFi Collateral Following ‘Black Thursday’ Chaos      The high-net-worth clients, family offices and institutional players that Genesis typically serves are definitely following everything that’s happening in the DeFi space, said Moro, but these sorts of investors need to know who is the counterparty on the other end of a contract.      “The idea of smart contracts kind of being your counterparty is still a new and nebulous idea, certainly to the legal and compliance arm of a business,” said Moro. “That’s not to say that DeFi couldn’t make its way into corporate America, but it’s a long way from now, in my opinion.”    The logical evolution is that lending markets built on stablecoins are going to grow significantly.    There are possible areas of crossover, involving crypto hedge funds that can handle the counterparty risk in return for price arbitrage opportunities, Moro added.      “There are guys that are comfortable with the counterparty risk, trading liquidity and volatility, who are able to [arbitrage] to two markets and kind of intersect both worlds,” said Moro. “That’s a natural development, but it’s also hard to price the risk.”      Read more: Behind ‘Prime Broker’ Buzzword Lies a Complex Strategy Game for Crypto Firms      While USDC’s 200% growth this year is impressive, in terms of volume, tether (USDT) dominates the stablecoin space with about 10 billion in circulation. Allaire believes issuing a transparent, regulated dollar stablecoin (USDC is audited by global accountancy firm Grant Thornton) will win out in the long run.      “There are obviously other stablecoins that have been in the market for a long time and are not regulated,” Allaire said. “What’s backing them is an open question and we have seen various legal inquiries. If you’re talking about building the future financial system, I think you want to build on something solid.”",POSITIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/30/circle-gets-25m-from-dcg-to-drive-usdc-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5933b8b98d0721cfd9ddfdc8bdcf5dd48f8c0948-1200x968.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384264,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA6st3,1596110852,First Mover: Sleepy Fed Meeting Belies Tense Economic Reality (Brrr) That May Buoy Bitcoin,"After a two-day closed-door meeting this week, the Federal Reserve issued a six-paragraph statement on Wednesday and held an hour-long press conference.      None of that was news, of course, and neither was anything else emanating from the U.S. central bank, which announced no policy changes.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      But here's what really happened over the past two days: Another $5 billion of freshly created money was injected into financial markets, based on the $80 billion of bond purchases the Fed is conducting every month to keep financial markets functioning smoothly as the fast-spreading coronavirus devastates the global economy.      The contrast couldn't have been starker between the lack of drama at the Fed meeting and investors' growing anxiety over what is, by all accounts, one of the most excruciatingly tense and fragile moments in modern economic history.      Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange firm Quantum Economics, told clients in a note late Tuesday the Fed's money printer – often known by the purported sound it makes, ""Brrr"" – was now mostly producing a ""yawwwwwwwnnnn."" (That's six w's, four n's.)      ""The Fed is doing its best to speak softly (literally) so as not to wake up the markets,"" Greenspan wrote. ""The more boring, the better.""      Beneath the surface, all is not well, and a recent jump in prices for bitcoin might be one of the best indications of that, because a growing number of investors see the cryptocurrency as a decent hedge against everything from hyperinflation to economic armageddon. Similar to gold, even if not always perfectly in sync.      Bitcoin is up 57% this year, climbing to about $11,261 on Wednesday in an anemic but upward drift that barely twitched from its listless trajectory when the Fed's statement emerged at 2 p.m. ET.      U.S. lawmakers are at odds on everything from the specifics of a relief bill likely to cost at least $1 trillion to the possibility of contracting the disease from a mask. The Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs warned earlier this week that the U.S. dollar is at risk of losing its status as the de facto global reserve currency.      Dwindling numbers of big investors are assigning any credibility to the assurances of President Donald Trump's administration that the economy is headed toward a V-shaped recovery. Pantheon, a macroeconomic forecasting firm, says the U.S. economy in the second quarter probably had its ""biggest drop ever recorded, by far."" Jobless claims probably rose to about 16.5 million last week.      Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at money-market giant BlackRock, told CNBC that the U.S. dollar, which is on course to post its worst month in a decade, will likely continue to decline.      ""I think we're in a different regime around the dollar,"" Rieder told the channel.      The only thing that seems certain is that the Federal Reserve will keep creating billions of dollars a day and pumping them into global markets. On Wall Street, it's not even controversial anymore to suggest that the stock market is being propped up by the U.S. central bank.      This week's Fed meeting ""underscored the focus, especially in an election year, that our federal government has in keeping the economy humming,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund BitBull Capital, told First Mover in a phone interview.      ""They're going to keep the monetary stock flowing, and that should be good for bitcoin as people become more comfortable with an asset that has in the past been seen as more risky,"" DiPasquale said.      Fidelity Investments, which oversees $7.3 trillion of customer assets, wrote this month in a report that bitcoin's ""next wave of awareness and adoption could be driven by external factors such as unprecedented levels of intervention by central banks and governments, record low interest rates, increasing fiat money supply, deglobalization and the potential for ensuing inflation, all of which have been accelerated by the pandemic and economic shutdown.""      It's quite a list. And hard to argue with any of that, which collectively provided the subtext for this week's Fed meeting.      Powell was candid about the Fed's willingness to provide further monetary accommodation, even after policy makers earlier this year slashed interest rates close to zero and expanded the central bank's balance sheet by roughly $3 trillion. The amount represents roughly 75% of the total amount of money previously created in its 107-year history.      One question might be whether the Fed can stimulate markets with more dollars if the U.S. currency is looking weak in foreign-exchange markets. According to Pantheon, the Fed may have to increase the pace of its monthly bond purchases once the ""Treasury begins to issue the $1.5 trillion extra debt we reckon will be needed to finance the next relief bill.""      ""We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy,"" Powell said during the press conference, using language nearly identical to language he has used on multiple prior occasions since March, when the Fed first began plying the financial system with emergency loans and liquidity.      ""The way Powell emphasizes it, they're going to continue to pump liquidity and easy money into the markets,"" John Todaro, of the digital-asset analysis firm TradeBlock, said Wednesday in a phone interview. ""It was just kind of a rehash of, Hey, how dovish are these folks going to get?""      First Mover reported earlier this week that Deutsche Bank Strategist Jim Reid sees the Fed adding another $12 trillion to its balance sheet over the next few years, to the $7.01 trillion of total assets as of last week.      Fed policy makers did their best this week not to make news. That doesn't mean they're not doing a lot. Bitcoin traders are more focused on the Brrr than the yawwwwwwnnnn.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $10,955 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,345 | 24-Hr Low: $10,913      Trend: Despite a small drop, bitcoin's overall trend still looks bullish with longer duration charts showing an upside break of a 2.5-year long descending trendline.      That doesn't necessarily imply a 90-degree run toward resistance at $12,000. In fact, we could see the cryptocurrency pull back to the former resistance-turned-support at $10,500 (February high) in the next day or so, recent price action suggests.      The cryptocurrency hit a wall during another attempt to establish a foothold above $10,300 during the U.S. hours on Wednesday and has been losing altitude ever since. At the time of writing, bitcoin is changing hands a little below $11,000, representing a 1.7% drop on the day.      A similar pattern was seen on Monday, when the cryptocurrency tagged a multi-month high above $11,300 before making a quick retreat to $11,000.      The consecutive failure to keep gains above $11,300 alongside an overbought reading on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) may indicate ebbing bullish momentum. The 4-hour chart RSI, too, has breached a bullish trendline, representing the rally from $9,000 to $11,300.      As such, a deeper pullback to $10,500 cannot be ruled out. A violation there would expose the psychological support of $10,000. The broader bullish bias would be invalidated only if prices find acceptance under $9,760 – a trendline falling from December 2017 and June 2019 highs.      The case for deeper retracement would weaken if prices rise above the Asian session high of $11,126. In that case, the bulls will likely have another attempt at breaching the newfound resistance zone above $11,300.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/30/first-mover-sleepy-fed-meeting-belies-tense-economic-reality-brrr-that-may-buoy-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41c854d1cad703b69ccc3e34ac189a147fceaeb3-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384242,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA6sV9,1596106626,"tZERO Slashes Jobs, Salaries as It Gears Up for Another Funding Round","Security token platform tZERO, which has tried to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, has cut staff and salaries as it hunts for more capital.    In an otherwise upbeat company update Wednesday, CEO Saum Noursalehi said tZERO had ""significantly reduced"" its cash burn rate by 45% year on year.  Savings came from cuts to legal costs and staff; remaining senior staff took salary cuts in return for company equity.  Board members are now compensated only in equity; Noursalehi said he reduced his own salary by 60%.  ""This underscores just how much I, and others, believe in our mission,"" he wrote, adding that development work for the tZERO platform was mostly complete.  tZERO is now preparing for another capital raise, Noursalehi confirmed, though he didn't disclose a funding target.  A majority-owned subsidiary of U.S. online retailer Overstock, tZERO raised $134 million in an initial coin offering in 2018, short of its $250 million target.  Chinese fund GoldenSands Capital pledged to lead a $374.55 million round for tZERO in 2018 but this was knocked down to a $5 million investment in April 2020.  In the note Wednesday, Noursalehi claimed tZERO dominated the security token space, accounting for 95% of token trading volume and 80% of the dollar value.  But the tZERO platform only has three broker-dealers and two security tokens – a third token, for real estate in Aspen, Colo., will be listed soon.  In an SEC filing for Q1 2020, tZERO said it made a gross profit just shy of $76,000 and the company reported a $10 million net loss in Q2 2019.

Led by the Ministry of Public Security, China's top police force agency, investigators also arrested another 82 core members of the scheme, according to a report from Chinese financial news outlet CLS on Thursday.  The pyramid scheme is said to have grown to over 3,000 layers since last year and fleeced over 2 million people by using cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, as a funding channel.  The total amount of crypto assets swindled from investors is approximately worth a whopping 40 billion yuan, or $5.7 billion, the report said.  The case marks the first time Chinese police have cracked down on a major international Ponzi scheme that used bitcoin as an exchange method.  Law enforcement started investigating last year and had arrested six members alleged to be connected to the scheme.  However, the 109 leaders and core members newly arrested had fled the country at the time. It's not clear in the report where they were apprehended.  The six arrested in 2019 were extradited to China from Vanuatu, where Plus Token was alleged to have operations.

Announced Wednesday, the open-source smart-contract platform designed to challenge Ethereum's lead position hard forked from the centralized Byron network into the decentralized Shelley network.  The team behind Cardano's transformation is blockchain research and development startup IOHKhttps://iohk.io/en/projects/cardano/team/.  IOHK's CEO Charles Hoskinson said Cardano has been carefully developed over five years and ""hundreds"" of assets are expected to be running on the blockchain in a year's time.  According to a press release, Shelley will increase ""security and robustness,"" while enabling more blockchain use cases.  The upgrade will utilize the Ouroboros consensus algorithm – a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol leveraging cryptography, combinatorics and mathematical game theory.  By implementing Shelley on Cardano's mainnet, staking pools will now be able to register on the chain visible to token holders, enabling them to delegate to pools immediately once registered.  The PoS delegation process lets users holding Cardano's native ADA token commit their tokens to a pool for a share of rewards, which the company said will incentivize the network to run ""accurately.""  Cardano will reach consensus equilibrium once 1,000 stake pools have been established, 485 of which are currently live.  IOHK said Shelley represents a ""first step"" in a series of enhancements to the network over the coming months with expectations that its Project Catalyst will launch by year's end.  Catalyst will introduce a governance model enabling the Cardano community to cast votes on the direction of the blockchain, including software updates, technical improvements and the long-term future of the network.

42384225,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA31E3,1596086709,CoinDesk Live Recap: Ethereum's DeFi Luminaries Discuss What's Next,"For decentralized finance (DeFi) to make its mark, it must reach beyond the crypto bubble, said MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen.      “Compared to where we’re going next, we’ve still just scratched the surface of what this technology will do,” Christensen, whose lending platform recently topped $1 billion in committed assets, said.      He was joined by fellow DeFi luminaries Robert Leshner and Hayden Adams on Wednesday in a live-streamed conversation on the state of the $3.8 billion DeFi market. The session, part of CoinDesk’s Ethereum at Five series, was moderated by reporter Will Foxley.      It will certainly be a hard row to hoe, but the craze for yield farming and other middleman-less innovations could yet subvert traditional lenders. To date, DeFi has arguably been Ethereum’s best use case.      “We’re moving towards a world of mass tokenization, where everything that has value is going to be tokenized,” said Adams, the founder of Uniswap, a platform for exchanging ERC-20 tokens. “At the moment it looks like Ethereum is at least in the lead in terms of where it’s going to be tokenized.”      Leshner, the founder of the Compound lending protocol, said DeFi has the potential to transform the opaque, expensive and slow systems of traditional finance.      “The best things that work in traditional finance are the things that you know are there, they work and they’re not that exciting,” Leshner said. “Can you supply $100 million of assets and begin earning interest on them immediately? Or can you borrow $100 million of assets instantaneously and note that the entire system works?”      Read more: One Billion, Two Billion, Three Billion, Four?

42384227,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA31Hp,1596078657,CoinDesk Live Recap: The DAO Hack Is Still a Mystery,"The DAO exploit of 2016 was a $55 million heist that forever altered Ethereum’s trajectory.      On Tuesday, CoinDesk Live gathered a handful of blockchain veterans to look back at the incident. Cornell computer science professor Emin Gün Sirer, white-hat hacker Griff Green and MyEtherWallet founder Taylor Monahan were joined by Bloomberg reporter Matt Leising to unpack the hack’s lingering mysteries.      Beyond leading to a contentious hard fork and the creation of Ethereum Classic, The DAO hack laid bare core issues relating to blockchain development.      As Gün Sirer put it on Tuesday: ""Is code law or do these systems serve human purposes?""      To recap: After 3.6 million ether (ETH) was stolen from The DAO in June 2016, Ethereum developers eventually reached consensus to turn back the clock, reverse the theft transactions and restore users’ lost funds. This rollback could only be implemented through a network-wide change called a hard fork. The fork split the blockchain in two, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, each with differing views of the ""immutability"" of distributed ledger systems.      Tuesday's conversation offered first-person tales of the hack and its aftermath.      ""A group of trusted Ethereum hackers got together to try to stop the bleeding,"" Green said. ""We weren't very successful at stopping the bleeding, honestly, but at one point it just stopped. Several hours later the hacker only took about 30% of the ether in The Dao and then just stopped – and we weren't sure exactly why.""      The group figured out how to hack the system as well, Green said, protecting the remaining 70%.      Four years later, the lesson learned for blockchain protocols beyond Ethereum is that if you don't like the ""law"" of a particular chain, ""you can always fork out,"" said Monahan, now CEO of MyCrypto.      Gün Sirer agreed. ""These monetary systems only have value to the extent they serve people. Code is not law, code is buggy, law is law,"" he said.

42384232,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA31Qd,1596074400,A Crypto Derivatives Exchange Is Getting a Nasdaq Listing in Q3,"Newly launched derivatives platform EQUOS.io is set to become the United States' first publicly-traded crypto exchange later this year through a ""backdoor listing"" on the Nasdaq.      Its operator, Hong Kong-based Diginex, announced Thursday it is combining EQUOS.io with Singapore's 8i Enterprises Acquisition Corp – a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listed on the Nasdaq.      SPACs are shell companies that use funds from their initial public offerings (IPOs) to acquire target companies, bringing them public through the ""backdoor."" Around since the 1990s, they've experienced something of a renaissance in recent years, with the total amount raised hitting a record $13.6 billion in 2019 – more than four times the $3.2 billion in 2016.      Diginex CEO Richard Byworth told CoinDesk that SPACs were faster and cheaper than traditional listings. In addition, they fix valuations in advance, avoiding the possibility of WeWork-like devaluations at the last minute, he noted.      EQUOS.io will be the first publicly-traded cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. once the acquisition is completed in September, Byworth said.      Newly launched, EQUOS.io is an institutional-oriented exchange with a team from the traditional derivatives space. The ambition is to expand the still-nascent crypto derivatives scene to hundreds of times the size of the spot market – just like traditional markets.      See also: First Mover: Crypto’s $35T Moment Could Come From Analog-World Stock Listings      Diginex had planned to move ahead with the listing much earlier. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the acquisition back in late February with a shareholder vote confirming the deal planned for March 20, around the time global equity markets were in a tailspin.      ""If you remember, that was the day when the S&P 500 was down 12.5%,"" Byworth said, ""so the conclusion was probably not the best day to go to market.""      EQUOS.io isn't the only crypto company heading to the public market. Ant Group, one of the principal issuers for China's digital yuan, announced a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai earlier this month. Crypto exchange Coinbase is also said to be considering a direct listing for 2021.      Chinese mining chip manufacturer Canaan Creative held a $100 million IPO in November 2019. Since listing, its share price has fallen by two-thirds, from $9 to $3 at press time.      After filing again with the SEC and being re-approved in June, everything is now set for the Nasdaq listing. Although U.S. citizens will be able to purchase shares in EQUOS.io, Byworth said that the exchange itself will not actually operate in the country.      See also: Israel’s Stock Exchange Says It Is Launching a Blockchain Platform for Securities Lending      So why list on the Nasdaq? CoinDesk asked.      ""The Nasdaq listing is more about the credibility and trust,"" Byworth said, adding that it remains the foremost stock exchange for tech stocks anywhere in the world.      With the bull run in tech stocks showing no signs of slowing and that the company will become one of the very first cryptocurrency firms to trade on the Nasdaq, Diginex has a compelling investment case for its derivatives exchange, he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/30/a-crypto-derivatives-exchange-is-getting-a-nasdaq-listing-in-q3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c08b4f33dbd159f52c695130fd4db7738425c50d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
