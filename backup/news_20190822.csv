Pantheon is a suite of ethereum-based services built by PegaSys, a 50-strong engineering team at ConsenSys. The Pantheon ethereum client, built on Java, is used to develop enterprise applications with features like privacy and permissioning.  The proposal was sent out in a Hyperledger mailing list email on Aug. 8, and if it is accepted, Pantheon will be renamed Hyperledger Besu (a Japanese term for base or foundation).  The approval would bring Pantheon’s protocol under Hyperledger, joining blockchain projects like Hyperledger Fabric backed by IBM and Hyperledger Sawtooth backed by Intel.  Notably, however, Pantheon would become the first public blockchain project added to the Hyperledger umbrella, meaning the Pantheon code would be published on Hyperledger’s proprietary GitHub page and open to contribution from developers already involved in the project.  Pantheon runs on the Ethereum public network, private networks and test networks such as Rinkeby, Ropsten and Görli.  Hyperledger's foray into ethereum began with Burrow, and the consortium has partnered with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance to collaborate on common standards for the blockchain space.  The new proposal comes as Hyperledger enterprise blockchain competitor R3 announced last month that it was on a hiring spree, expanding its London office and opening a second engineering hub.

Already available in 30 countries, Pundi aims to sell 100,000 XPOS devices by 2021. This is part of the firm’s plan to introduce cryptocurrencies for everyday use, through an ecosystem of financial products like its XPASS crypto debit cards and Xwallet.  “We made the XPOS with the mission of creating real-life use cases for blockchain technology, and this couldn’t be better represented than Traki shoppers paying for their daily needs with cryptocurrency,” said Pundi X CEO, Zac Cheah.  Cheah continued to say that Traki has been an early adopter of blockchain technology in Venezuela.  “At Traki, we aspire to offer the most convenient options for our customers, and cryptocurrency has proven to be an effective payment solution,” said Michael Gomez, Chief of Crypto Assets department of Traki. Of Pundi's near-300,000 wallet users, approximately one-tenth are based in Venezuela.

The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange announced today in a blog post, the open-sourced Walletlink acts as a “secure bridge” between the Coinbase ecosystem and the traditional web.  The feature will enable Coinbase Wallet users to access and administer their funds – separate from their crypto holdings on Coinbase.com – from a desktop Dapp interface for the first time, said Coinbase Wallet product lead Sid Coelho-Prabhu.  Coinbase has long supported the use of decentralized platforms through its mobile wallet app, a feature the company says has garnered hundreds of thousands of users. Now, the company looks to expand access beyond its mobile app to desktop browsers like Google Chrome, Brave, and Opera. Though a user's private keys are still securely stored on their mobile devices.  The company said this saves users from having to install “clunky browser extensions, copying and pasting private keys across devices, and seeing fragmented wallet balances.""  Instead, a user scans a QR code that propagates an encrypted link between the wallet app and browser. The system also provides a security feature that pings users on their mobile devices after they make transactions.  The Dapps  The first four Dapps supported by Walletlink offer decentralized financial (DeFi) services for crypto holdings. Coelho-Prabhu said the firm approached the most popular Dapps in the market to launch with the new feature, including Compound, a protocol to earn interest, Maker, an ETH lending service, IDEX, a decentralized exchange, and dYdX, a protocol for margin trading, borrowing and lending.  The company plans to expand access to other Dapp categories. In fact, Coelho-Prabhu said Coinbase Wallet worked with programmers to make the development process from ""demoing to integration"" as simple as possible.  In addition to Dapps, the Coinbase Wallet software enables access to ERC-20 token platforms, token airdrops and ICOs, as well as collecting non-fungible tokens, online shopping, and P2P crypto transactions.  In February, Coinbase wallet unveiled a cloud-storage backup to safely store user’s private keys.

The agreement was covered heavily in the local press. It was confirmed by the company by email and by a release and via ARTnGUIDE's website.  Under the terms of the deal, Iconloop's 'broof' service will record the ownership of the artwork, along with the image of that work, in a manner that prevents falsification of the record. A timestamped certificate is issued that displays the image as well as a 'chop' stamp signature.  ARTnGUIDE currently has 16 jointly-owned works listed on its website. The works include five by Lee Ufan, founder of the avant-garde School of Things, and three works of Whanki Kim, an early abstract artist in Korea.  At present, the co-ownership of each work is recorded by utilizing an ethereum-based service. The record, which is publicly accessible, includes ownership status and a detailed change history.  Iconloop says that its offering significantly differs from the existing system as it will allow for the recording of the image. It is not clear whether the broof system will completely replace the current records platform or work along side of it.

The move comes via a partnership with institutional messaging service Paradigm, according to a BNN Bloomberg report on Thursday.  Deribit's CEO, John Jansen, reportedly said the new service will offer block trades with a minimum of 40 bitcoin and 800 ether for options contracts linked to those cryptocurrencies.  Ten top crypto trading firms have already signed up to use the service, with Paradigm founder Anand Gomes naming QCP Capital in the report.  According to its website, Paradigm offers tools allowing over-the-counter traders to automate price negotiation and settlement. Using Paradigm's messaging service, parties can set up the options trades, which are then then settled and cleared at Deribit. Commonly, traders use Telegram to carry out such negotiations.  Amsterdam-based Deribit is not regulated in the Netherlands, since local regulation defines derivatives as cash-settled contracts, BNN Bloomberg says. However, the exchange has the safety net of an insurance fund, should traders default on payments due to issues like bankruptcy.

42403197,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfCIf,1566471611,Bitcoin Selloff Stalls at Historical Price Support Near $10K,"View  Bitcoin's defense of the 100-day moving average and a bullish divergence of an hourly chart indicator suggest scope for a minor price bounce to $10,300  Bitcoin will remain in the hunt for a drop to $9,467 (Aug. 13 low), as long as the rising wedge breakdown seen on the 4-hour chart remains valid.  A UTC close above $10,956 would shift risk in favor of a rally to $11,850-$12,000. A weekly close above $12,000 is needed to confirm bullish revival.  Bitcoin (BTC) sellers are again struggling to force a sustained break below a widely-followed support level, but the outlook would turn bullish only above $10,956.  The premier cryptocurrency by market value fell by $600 in the Asian trading hours on Wednesday, confirming a rising wedge breakdown on the intraday charts.  The bearish reversal pattern opened the doors for a retest of the Aug. 15 low of $9,467, as discussed yesterday. So far, however, that target has remained elusive and the dips below the 100-day moving average (MA), currently at $9,900, have been short-lived.  It's worth noting that the long-term MA worked as strong support earlier this month. The cryptocurrency ran into bids below the 100-day MA on Aug. 15 and closed (UTC) that day with gains above $10,300. The average was again defended on the following day and the subsequent price bounce ended up hitting highs above $10,950 on Aug. 20.  So, if the 100-day MA continues to hold ground over the next few hours, chart-driven buying could lead to a price bounce.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,970 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.7-percent loss on the day.  Daily and hourly charts  The lower wick attached to today's candle (above left) represents a failure on the part of the bears to keep the cryptocurrency below the 100-day MA. The average also proved a tough nut to crack on Wednesday.  The repeated defense of the key MA, coupled with the bullish divergence (higher lows) of the hourly chart relative strength index (above right) indicates scope for a rise to $10,300 over the next few hours.  The path of least resistance, however, will remain to the downside as long as prices are held below $10,956 – the bearish lower high created on Aug. 20.  The bulls will likely have a tough time forcing a break above $10,956, as the daily chart indicators are biased bearish. For instance, the RSI is holding below 50 and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is printing negative values.  Further, the 5- and 10-week moving averages have produced a bearish crossover, as discussed earlier this week.  The fact that last week's bounce from the 100-day MA ended up charting a bearish lower high indicates a weakening of bullish sentiment.  4-hour chart  The case for a drop to the Aug. 15 low of $9,467 put forward by the rising wedge breakdown will remain valid as long as prices remain below $10,807 – the high of the candle confirming the breakdown.  Daily line chart  The line chart of daily closing prices helps investors look through the noise created by daily highs and lows.  If prices close above $10,000 today and end up rising above $10,927 (Aug. 16 close) in the next day or two, then a double-bottom bullish breakout would be confirmed. That would open the doors to $11,850.  Weekly chart  BTC has failed at least four times in the last eight weeks to close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000. So, a weekly close above that level is needed to confirm a complete bullish revival.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42403193,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfCEj,1566464456,"In Palestine, Civilians Are Using Bitcoin More Than Hamas","The Takeaway:  Experts say Hamas is now using bitcoin for cross-border fundraising at an unprecedented rate. Still, even the largest estimates of terror financing in the region are apparently dwarfed by civilian bitcoin usage in the Gaza Strip, local experts tell CoinDesk.  General awareness in Palestine of bitcoin and ethereum has increased since 2018.  Freelance payments and remittances are reportedly the leading use-cases for bitcoin transactions in the Palestinian territories.      Ethical uses of bitcoin are more popular than ever among civilians in Palestine, sources have told CoinDesk.  “There are some offices that now do $5 million to $6 million a month,” freelance developer and Gaza-based bitcoiner Ismael Al-Safadi told CoinDesk about local money changers. “I’ve seen a local trader send 100 BTC in one [transaction]. ... There are also a lot of small clients. They send $200 or $1,000.”  The $5 million figure dwarves the ""tens of thousands of dollars"" in illicit transactions reported earlier this week by the New York Times.  Last year, CoinDesk reported that one such cryptocurrency dealer served roughly 50 clients a month purchasing or liquidating an average of $500 each. He has since relocated to Europe, having earned enough to emigrate.  Yet two sources with knowledge of the matter estimated there are up to 20 bitcoin dealers now operating in Gaza. Since PayPal and other online services exclude the Palestinian territories, this is one of the only ways for freelancers to easily receive international payments.  For example, Al-Safadi takes more than 70 percent of his monthly earnings in bitcoin. Based on the social media groups he participates in, Al-Safadi estimates there are around 10,000 occasional bitcoin users in Gaza. Indeed, an anonymous source in Gaza who taught seminars about cryptocurrency to roughly 300 Palestinians since 2017, told CoinDesk just one such Facebook group focused on bitcoin has 5,000 members.  The teacher said there is a nascent interest in ethereum applications among Palestinians as well, both at home and abroad.  Another Palestinian based in the United Arab Emirates (who wished to remain anonymous) is developing an ethereum-based charity platform. He told CoinDesk the first pilots will distribute crypto donations to schools in both Gaza and the West Bank, aiming to reduce the number of Palestinian children unable to afford a good education. A test experiment began last week.  He said:  “People there [in Palestine] are starting to learn and ask about it. ... Palestinians are more using bitcoin [than ether] ... to make international transfers and to bypass Israeli control.”  It’s hard to say what the local transaction volume truly is, since the Palestinian crypto ecosystem doesn’t connect directly to banks or global crypto exchanges. Instead, much like the Iranian community in 2018, it is dominated by peer-to-peer transactions, private social media groups and unofficial dealers.  All Gazan sources agreed: most local bitcoin users are cashing out in fiat, not holding or using it for secondary business transactions.  Yet, perhaps as an unintended consequence, the teacher said that Hamas’s ongoing fundraising campaign to gather bitcoin donations from abroad for its military wing, the Qassam Brigades, has actually boosted awareness among the civilian population.  “Everybody was talking about 'what is bitcoin' then,” the teacher said about news in February, when blockchain analytics firms identified a Coinbase account participating in a campaign that garnered $4,000.  Hamas effect  Part cypherpunk black market, part terror-driven police state, the Gaza Strip since 2018 has generated a truly unique bitcoin ecosystem.  On one hand, entrepreneurs are using bitcoin in slowly growing numbers thanks to the high demand for mobile financial services. According to recent data from the Palestinian Monetary Authority presented in July at a fintech workshop in the West Bank city of Rawabi, 77 percent of adults in the Palestinian territories are unbanked even though 2.6 million Palestinians have smartphones.  Al-Safadi, the Gaza-based developer, told CoinDesk that Qassam Brigades operations are “secret” and not publicly related to the civilian bitcoin ecosystem. However, bitcoin dealers are now required to record the wallet address, amount and full name and ID number of every client for each liquidation for police records.  “Gaza works like a black market,” he said, adding he doesn’t know what the police do with this “surveillance” information.  Meanwhile, Hamas's Qassam Brigades have stepped up their bitcoin fundraising strategy this past summer. According to the New York Times, the Qassam Brigade website now features a bitcoin tutorial and a wallet address generator to create a fresh account for each donation.  An anonymous source with knowledge of the matter told CoinDesk these donations have exceeded $12,000 so far this year. Another anonymous anti-money-laundering expert with knowledge of Hamas operations estimated the terror group’s bitcoin mining brought in $195,000 worth of crypto this year.  Such activities related to bitcoin are generally deemed non-compliant by local banks, as there’s still a longstanding rift between Palestinian political factions in different territories. A spokeswoman for the Bank of Palestine, which operates in both the Hamas-governed Gaza Strip and the Fatah-governed West Bank, told CoinDesk that the Palestinian Monetary Authority forbids institutional bitcoin transactions.  “We are not allowed, as banks, to trade with [bitcoin] or use it under any circumstances,” the Bank of Palestine spokeswoman said.  Regional censorship  Even with all these factors considered, most Palestinian sources estimate the aforementioned civilian usage far outweighs bitcoin-related terror activity in the region.  Most Palestinian bitcoin users are accepting bitcoin payments for freelance work, or remittances from family abroad, and cashing it out through local peer-to-peer groups. The UAE-based nonprofit operator said that, in an attempt to curtail terror financing, Israeli and American authorities sometimes interfere with bank transfers.  Indeed, in 2006 after Hamas rose to power, cash transfers to Gaza were temporarily halted across the board.  “The crypto market is promising in Palestine and has a good opportunity to grow there,” the UAE-based source added.  Both Al-Safadi and the local seminar teacher said they hope global exchanges and official banks will eventually allow Palestinians to transact with bitcoin through compliant digital platforms.  “Bitcoin has a unique potential, but it’s not a big potential. There are still many steps to be taken,” the teacher said, adding:  “In Germany, you have places to go to exchange bitcoin easily without extra fees and hustles ... something like this has to be here in Gaza. If it stays between some IT guys and money exchangers that are willing to take risks, it stays like this.”  Palestinian teen image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/22/in-palestine-civilians-are-using-bitcoin-more-than-hamas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15420ee9d0251a019e4156b365b9509240cdcfb6-2282x1220.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MouseBelt  's Blockchain Accelerator launched Wednesday at UC Davis, UC Los Angeles and UC Santa Barabara, boosting the educational presence at the noted U.S. schools. Backed by over $40 million in funding from NueValue Capital, MouseBelt currently aids 65 student blockchain community groups at 14 universities worldwide.  The accelerator joins MouseBelt's advisory team and media groups Bitcoin Radio and MouseBelt University.  Bundled into two programs, MouseBelt will sponsor undergraduate to PhD level programs. The first fund will cover research across all three campuses, specifically for blockchain project development. MouseBelt has set aside $500,000 in funding with up to five projects jockeying for $100,000 in seed funding.  MouseBelt is also donating to the three universities engineering departments. The accelerator is hoping to co-op the donations for the development of a general fundraiser toward university selected research capped at $500,000.  Speaking with CoinDesk, university outreach director Ashlie Meredith said the program is designed to fill a knowledge gap in the university level system. Most universities do not hold blockchain classes, leaving student organizations to fill the void.  A little over a year ago, these same student organizations became the basis for MouseBelt's current initiative.  Meredith said:  “We aim to help these universities become a driving force for innovation in the blockchain space, as well as provide students and researchers with the opportunity for both theoretical and industry experience.""  What's in it for MouseBelt? Meredith says it's not only about equity holds in successful projects, but a long term play on student development.  Blockchain courses in demand  Dr Mohammad Sadoghi, head of ExpoLab at UC Davis, who has been working with MouseBelt for the past year in various functions, says student demand for blockchain coursework is high. Sadoghi told CoinDesk his engineering blockchain classes max out at 65 students, forcing him to add a waitlist and cut students.  “What would it look like if a computation is democratic and decentralized?"" Sadoghi asked in a conversation with CoinDesk. To him, blockchain technology is a paradigm shift in data storage and one requiring youthful creativity.  Running his own separate program at UC Davis, Sadoghi says undergraduates are currently forgotten in the space. Often, however, they hold the motivation and energy but merely lack the opportunity.

And, if the products being demoed in Berlin were any indication, those developers had already heeded the call.  Echoing the need for enhanced privacy measures atop existing blockchains, Harry Halpin, CEO of privacy startup Nym Technologies, said during his Web3 address:  “We want you [the user] to think very seriously about privacy. [Nym] tries to make it technically impossible, and not just legally difficult, to break privacy.”  Also championing the cause of data privacy was cryptocurrency pioneer David Chaum, who unveiled a new cryptocurrency called Praxxis on Tuesday to support his private messaging platform, Elixxir.  “The world ... needs the Elixxir communication technology,” Chaum said in a statement released Tuesday. “It is the only known practical way to shred the metadata that is inevitably created as we live our digital lives.”  The origins of Web3  Privacy is core part of the Web3 movement, said Gavin Wood.  The ethereum co-founder, Polkdaot creator and initial coiner of the term ""Web3,"" took the stage touting the ""social vision"" of a decentralized internet.  ""Let’s empower the individual against much more powerful corporate and state actors, particularly the ones that tend to misuse their powers or start to erode our expectations,” he said  Wood added that the still-aspirational decentralized internet was originally going to be called ""The Post-Snowden Web,"" as outlined in this Wood blog post from 2014.  In this way, Snowden’s debut at Web3 Summit was a full-circle moment: one that reaffirmed data privacy as being on the forefront of the minds of blockchain developers.  “What we need is not just technology but a social movement. The technologists in this room are the core of that movement,” said Nym CEO Halpin, adding enthusiastically as his closing remark:  “All power to the people!”  Edward Snowden speaks via video link at Web3 Summit 2019 (photo by Christine Kim for CoinDesk)",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/22/power-to-the-people-privacy-was-the-rallying-cry-of-berlins-web3-summit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e1ba79b6794a772021a3f64fc5bc9633b36fb22-1920x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
