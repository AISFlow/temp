42397695,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrFX,1402870460,DigitalBTC Makes History With Australian Stock Market Debut,"Australian multi-service bitcoin company digitalBTC will make history today as the first cryptocurrency-focused company to trade on a major mainstream stock exchange.  DigitalBTC, which began as a mining operation but also engages in bitcoin trading and is developing retail and consumer applications, debuted on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) this morning as Digital CC Limited (trading as digitalBTC; ASX code: DCC).  The ASX has a daily turnover of over AUD$4.6bn (US$4.32bn) and a market cap of around AUD$1.6tn.  Credibility rewards  The company views its new listing as crucial to building trust in a consumer bitcoin firm. Trust is a huge issue in the bitcoin world, and scandals involving some of its biggest names were seen as a turn-off for investors outside the bitcoin realm.  Legal requirements for the listing will make digitalBTC ""the most transparent bitcoin company around"", according to a spokesperson.  The listing opens doors to a different breed of investor than might normally put money into a bitcoin company: more risk-averse individual and institutional investors and, digitalBTC hopes, those with a lot more money to invest.  The path to listing  DigitalBTC has technically been listed on the ASX since its 'reverse takeover' and transformation of Macro Energy Limited back in March, but has pursued the extra legitimacy of its own listing since then, which required approval.  Its backers at the time, consisting of ""institutions and high net worth people"", committed AUD$9.1m (US$8.55m) to the deal at an effective price of $0.20 per share.  Since then, digitalBTC's mining operations have earned over 5,100 BTC and its established trading desk revenues had returns of 34% in May, up from 31% in April.  Final approval  The reverse takeover meant that Macro Energy officially acquired digitalBTC, giving the company a faster track to the exchange listing. Investors could buy shares in Macro, but the digitalBTC name was necessary to indicate the company's true business and gain value.  Trading has been suspended for the past three weeks while an ASX listing officer reviewed and approved the final paperwork, which is now complete.  The company has also lodged a prospectus with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).  Bitcoin vs 'real' exchanges  Observers will be keen to see what happens to digitalBTC's share price. Most bitcoin startups, where listed, trade on bitcoin-only and 'unofficial' stock exchanges, which operate in a regulatory grey area.  Just last week, SatoshiDICE and FeedZeBirds founder Erik Voorhees was fined $35,000 and forced to relinquish profits of almost $16,000 resulting from his offering of securities in the two firms.  Uncertainty surrounding crytpocurrency exchange listings is likely keeping mainstream investors at bay, at least until rules are properly clarified.  Reporting requirements  A major stock exchange listing also brings with it a raft of extra reporting and transparency requirements hitherto unknown to the bitcoin world. Among them are quarterly cashflow reports and six-monthly audited accounts, and should any legally-defined 'material' issue arise, it must be disclosed immediately.  DigitalBTC founder and now Executive Chairman, Mr Zhenya Tsvetnenko, said he was very pleased with the extensive progress made between March and finalizing the official launch today.  ""We’ve made a great start for digitalBTC, aggressively expanding our early bitcoin-focused operations, for some very good results. So much so that we are now one of the largest bitcoin miners in the world,"" he said.  ""What we really look forward to now is the success we can generate from development of our bitcoin retail consumer product line, as digital currencies such as bitcoin continue their explosive growth. Our successful early operation's growth positions us well to support our future development activities in the digital currency sector, and I look forward to the updates we can bring shareholders and the market in the coming months.""  DigitalBTC also has a hardware partnership with BitFury, which recently announced a $20m funding round of its own.  Bitcoin's march in Australia  Bitcoin and similar currencies are well on the way to mainstream acceptance in Australia, both at a corporate and official level.  Australian digital currency businesses also recently launched the The Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA), a body intended to function as a professional chamber of commerce for any companies involved in bitcoin either directly or indirectly, including bitcoin-using merchants and potentially even banks.  It would work in partnership with broader advocacy groups for bitcoin itself, like the Bitcoin Foundation-affiliated Bitcoin Association of Australia.  Tax rules  The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has also announced its intention to release official taxation guidelines for bitcoin businesses and investors, probably before the end of the current Australian financial year on 30th June.  Although the local Bitcoin Association has published its own recommendations in anticipation, the ATO has not yet revealed its policy.

42397689,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDr9d,1402836320,Will Industrial Mining Become the Next Big Bitcoin Investment Sector?,"Investment interest in the bitcoin ecosystem has skyrocketed in 2014, with this year's investment figures already having surpassed 2013s totals due to major investments in merchant processor BitPay, secure wallet provider Xapo and e-commerce and online banking platform Circle, which have accounted for a combined $67m in fundraising.  This list of more well-known, merchant or consumer-focused bitcoin companies was joined more recently by a sizeable investment in bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer and industrial mining facility operator BitFury, which announced it had closed a $20m round on 30th May.  Though bitcoin mining has long been a point of emphasis for the bitcoin ecosystem, BitFury's investment round may be evidence that VC investors are giving more credence to companies providing fundamental services to the greater bitcoin business ecosystem.  The recent activity suggests institutional mining may be the next point of emphasis for the investment community, and industry observers already seem to have sensed the trend.  More rounds expected  This shift toward large-scale mining was underscored on 12th June by a $400,000 investment in bitcoin mining rig hosting firm HashPlex.  One of the US company's principal investors, SecondMarket CEO Barry Silbert, noted the trend to CoinDesk, suggesting his investment was in part a move to counter this effort:  ""As digital currency mining has shifted to larger, well-funded ‘industrial’ mining companies, I was attracted to the idea of giving the little guy the opportunity to participate by hosting their mining equipment at professionally run, low energy cost facilities.""  While well-intentioned, the investment may do little to stem coming investments in the growing sector.  US-based industrial mining facility operator MegaBigPower – which once earned more than $8m a month from its mining efforts each month at peak bitcoin price levels, told CoinDesk it is currently working to finalize an investment round, which it estimates will be of comparable size to BitFury's.  Though owner Dave Carlson did not provide further details, BitFury's major investors were eager to point out the reasons they expect similar investments in such industrial-scale operators to become more commonplace.  Industrial mining arms race  The driving force behind this potential increase in investment was perhaps best articulated by Binary Financial managing partner Harry Yeh. Speaking to CoinDesk, Yeh indicated that the window for industrial mining facilities to capitalize on the market for maximum returns is dwindling due to increased competition, which could lead to more immediate investments.  Citing figures culled from his talks with investors, Yeh stated:  ""Last year, if you wanted to be a big player in the mining space, you probably had to fork out anywhere between $3-$5m to get into industrial mining. This year, that amount is about $10-20m; next year, it will be $30-$40m and up.""  Further, as the market expands, Yeh said he believes that rising bitcoin prices will force more mainstream companies to invest in large data centers with bitcoin mining capabilities:  ""You're going to start seeing IBM and bigger companies getting into the game. Right now, the market is still too small, and this is just my opinion, [but] as the price moves up you'll have more interest.""  Risk and reward  Georgia Co-Investment Fund  CEO George Bachiashvili, whose firm also invested in BitFury's latest round, believes that this escalation is forthcoming, simply due to bitcoin's finite nature and the huge potential for profit it brings.  ""I think mining will become more like a commodity because more people will get into it and it will be harder to get a market share. Then, there's the price of the bitcoin itself. If it rises and reaches several thousand per bitcoin, I think good revenue can be generated,"" he said.  Given this upside, Bachiashvili stated that his company was happy to take the risk. He also suggested that investors may be beginning to look at bitcoin as a property with intrinsic value beyond its price, adding:  ""Bitcoin is more of a medium of exchange, something that has a utility that can be applied. That's why we don't look at it as a commodity. We look at it as a medium of exchange and that it will be used for money and signing transactions and proof of ownership and property.""  Opportunities abound  Given that industrial mining facilities are so close to the core element of the bitcoin ecosystem, Yeh noted that BitFury, and by extension other similar operators, may have the ability to tap multiple markets, even threatening more consumer-oriented mining companies and services.  ""What I see as happening is that [BitFury is] going to produce so many ASICs and there's only so many 1MW, 20MW or large megawatt facilities. It's just physically impossible to bring up that many facilities in a short span of time,"" he states.  Bachiashvili went further to suggest he believes it's not out of the question for the company to begin providing bitcoin wallets or other services for the ecosystem given its position.  Proven track record  Of course, BitFury's investors were also keen to point out that the large investment round is evidence of the work being conducted by the company – which has two large data centers in Finland and Iceland, and another nearing completion in Georgia.  Bachiashvili, for example, noted that his firm conducted stress tests on the company, and were pleased with the results.  ""We've done several stress tests of the company and included that into our calculations and they have proven to be pretty stable even at a low bitcoin price, it would have to go down close to zero in order for us not to recover the loan,"" he said.  The investors also spoke highly of the BitFury management and the company's ability to deliver on its products. This comes in spite of some more recent mainstream criticism of the founders.  Evident appeal  Though the question of whether mainstream investors will begin gravitating to mining is still uncertain, there are potential upsides for early adopters.  BitFury investor Bill Tai, whose portfolio includes investments in such successes as Scribd and Twitter, also suggested that investing in bitcoin's ground-level infrastructure can help investors become more informed about future movements in the industry, saying:  ""The appeal of BitFury to me goes beyond their expertise in mining, gear and silicon. In my opinion, they are one of the important central nodes of information in the bitcoin community in general. Their activities will expose me to many opportunities in the years to come.""  Still, he acknowledges that bitcoin is still polarizing, even if investors are catching on to potential opportunities in the space. BitFury's investment team, for example, consists of investors who have a more established knowledged of the ecosystem.  He concluded: ""The interest from VCs in bitcoin is very binary. Either you love it or are afraid. I definitely am not afraid.""

42397708,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrRL,1402832708,"Mining Roundup: BBB Warning, Alpha Technology and a Pool Attack","Succeeding in the cryptocurrency mining industry over the long term may require thinking outside of the box.  It takes creativity to rise above the rest and survive in such a fast-moving industry.  New ideas such as permacoin, which uses proof of work to store archival data, could be an example of this.  The recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing from San Francisco-based hardware designer HashFast is also significant. It's clear that major investment like the BitFury funding round or key partnerships like the creation of PeerNova are needed in order to ensure viability.  With that said, let’s look at what has been going on since our last roundup.  CoinTerra’s datacenter  The Wall Street Journal recently published a video of a CoinTerra mining datacenter located in Utah.  The Austin-based designer of miners has a facility filled with thousands of its 1.6TH/s units hashing away. And with so many miners, the sound of them whirring away is almost deafening on the video.  The report indicated that the facility rarely requires air conditioning, saying “the facility uses the ambient, dry cool air of the Utah desert to cool down the rigs”.  That may be true at night, but Utah is in a high desert where it's hot during the day in summer. There are very few datacenters that don’t need to utilize air conditioning, and this massive CoinTerra rig is likely not one of them.  Alpha Technology 'still working with Dexcel'  Manchester, UK-based Alpha Technology, which plans to bring a powerful scrypt miner to market, says that it still has a key partnership with Dexcel Designs in place.  Mohammed Akram, Director of Alpha Technology, told CoinDesk:  “Our partnership with Dexcel is fine. We have actually completed most of our design work, all work now is from the foundry and our manufacturing partners.”  Rumors of a possible breakdown in relations between Alpha and Dexcel had caused some turmoil. Some customers who preordered mining units had been requesting refunds, though Akram said this had been ""minimal"" over the past month.  One issue of concern had been that Alpha removed its partner's details from its website. However, this decision was made because Dexcel was not able to handle customer support queries directly, he explained.  The company says it is still on schedule to begin shipping units in July. Alpha currently lists two different Viper models on its website: a base model, specced at 50MH/s of hashing power at 375W (£1,350), and a more powerful version with 250MH/s at 1,875W (£5,450).  Better Business Bureau warns on mining  Cryptocurrency mining is now drawing the scrutiny of the Better Business Bureau (BBB), an independent consumer advocacy group – and it seems CoinTerra is the mining company drawing the most attention.  A BBB warning on ""bitcoin mining computers"" states:  “Complaints about [CoinTerra] are coming in not only from U.S. customers, but from those in other countries as well, including the United Kingdom and Australia.”  According to the BBB, it closed 11 complaints about the company in March and April. However, another 39 have since been opened, which led to the warning about the company.  The BBB offers a number of tips for people interested in acquiring mining equipment to better protect themselves. This includes using a credit card for payment, maintaining all order documentation and reviewing the BBB’s website for information regarding specific companies prior to making a purchase.  KNCMiner updates  Following the news that Stockholm, Sweden-based KNCMiner will be taping out its 400MH/s Titan scrypt miner, the company has made another production run ready for pre-order online, with two versions available.  There’s no exact timeline for this second batch of preorders, but they are slated to arrive one month after Batch 1 Titans.  Although the company’s webstore page for Batch 2 clearly indicates that will be no refunds for any shipment delays, KNC is offering customer incentives.  Looking down the road, KNCMiner also offered an update on its 20nm node. The designs, or wafers, have been sent to a fabrication plant to be turned into chips. Specs will likely be released when these units come back and are placed on boards.  Mining unknown altcoins  According to Coinmarketcap, there are 33 cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization over $1m. So is there potential in mining coins that most people don’t know about?  Wired  has a short piece examining this very subject, profiling a miner that uses a home rig of USB units to mine a variety of scrypt-based coins. Mining relative unknowns such as infinitecoin and zetacoin could be profitable, but is essentially a bet on the long-term success of altcoins.  There is risk, however, that some people will simply trade in these coins for more established digital currencies like bitcoin.  Nevertheless, mining protects a network. If a community of miners gets behind a coin, that can safeguard it and thus increase its value if it offers something to the community. Litecoin creator Charlie Lee is quoted saying: “Having ASICs come out to mine litecoin means that it’s really gotten to a point where it’s succeeded.”  Block withholding attacks  The Eligius pool has discovered that it was the victim of a 'block withholding attack', losing at least 300 bitcoins over the past few months.  In such an attack, a miner submits low-difficulty shares, but not block solutions. In effect, the scam fools the pool into thinking miners are participating when they aren't really.  Eligius, one of the oldest pools in existence, says it has now identified the source of the attack and blocked the individual(s) from participating.  With the potential profits from bitcoin mining so high, it is no surprise bad actors are attempting to attack or trick pools, who need to be vigilant about such attacks.

42397701,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrLR,1402829122,'Sigsafe' Key Tag Brings Bitcoin Payments to NFC Devices,"Designed to balance on-the-go payments with secure storage, Sigsafe is an electronic key that allows bitcoin transactions between near-field communication (NFC) devices.    “Securely storing your bitcoins is too complicated right now!” Sigsafe’s architect Peter R told CoinDesk. It was for this reason that he designed a tool to make securing bitcoins easier – one that would ""just work"" for the average user.    NFC-enabled payments are often trumpeted as a revolutionary commercial tool. Users can store their digital money on a device – a smartphone for example – tap a point-of-sale (POS) terminal and their payment will flow through the connection, no wallet required.  The Sigsafe tag provides this same functionality, but with bitcoin. Starting off, Peter imagined:  “Something [users] could buy, take out of the box, and immediately load up with coins at a bitcoin ATM and then 'tap and pay' at a bitcoin-enabled NFC point-of-sales terminal.”  Paypal  President David Marcus recently pronounced bitcoin a leader in revolutionizing commerce, but dismissed NFC as “technology for the sake of technology.” While rife with imaginative appeal, NFC hasn't made a significant dent in the market, while bitcoin remains in vogue.  However, by combining with bitcoin, Sigsafe is exploring a new route for the protocol.  More than one use  First off, the device can be used as a hot or cold wallet system by locking in a single address the tag is allowed to sign transactions to and from.  It also can function as a debit card when paired with NFC-enabled devices. Once compatible POS terminals crop up – software updates for this compatibility are also forthcoming – the tag would provide the functionality of a debit card.  If HTML5 browsers incorporate NFC, users could even carry out e-payments with the touch of the key tag.  Key tag owners can lay down a variety of transaction rules. Among them, users can require a password, establish a maximum transaction amount, or feed it any number of whitelisted spending addresses.  Some Inside Details  An ECDSA signature takes approximately 0.2 to 0.6 seconds to sign. The tag wakes up when the presence of a NFC-supported device enters its field. A green LED flashes if the transaction is authorized, if not, it transmits an error to the host and flashes red.  Over the course of the device's life, it could sign approximately 80,000 transactions.  The tag can function without a battery, but it includes a battery and clock to enable time-dependent transactions. It could potentially support advanced features like multi-signature wallets and hierarchical deterministic wallets.  The white paper warns of potential attack vectors like side-channel attacks, electron microscopes, and NSA backdoors.  “Beyond Bitcoin”  Peter designed the signing tag with deeper goals in mind. He said:  “I want people to think about it less like a bitcoin wallet and more like a general-purpose key. […] I think there is a big future for ECDSA signing tags, far beyond bitcoin. A single Sigsafe tag could unlock the doors to your home, authenticate you to your Gmail account, act as a loyalty card at a grocery store.”  Although storage and easy transactions are the short-term uses, the key tag could build intuition for something more disruptive.

42397700,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDrJT,1402826413,Bitcoin Wallet Apps Re-Enter iOS Store After Apple's Policy Shift,"Apple is making good on its recent bitcoin policy shift, with a new bitcoin wallet app appearing for download in the iOS App Store.  The 'Coinpocket' app is described by its developer as a wrapper for a previously available open source HTML5 version, this time with full access to the camera hardware for QR code scanning.  While its feature set is fairly basic, Coinpocket allows users to do anything they could do on previously-available iPhone wallet apps like Coinbase and Blockchain, which had gone some time without updates before being subsequently removed from the store.  The company updated its policy last week to include 'approved' digital currencies.  Features  The new app does offer a function that allows the user to 'sweep' funds into wallet from a private key – useful for quick transfers of BTC – along with the ability to generate a BIP38 encrypted version of the private key (although this can take a long time, with some reddit users reporting crashes).  Otherwise, Coinpocket offers simple send and receive functions and three different sources for current bitcoin price information.  With Apple now approving bitcoin wallets, the race is on for developers to create and submit more fully-featured apps for the mobile OS that still has a significant market share in some of the world's richest markets.  Users of previously popular apps, like Blockchain's which was downloaded over 120,000 times before being blocked, will now look forward to updates bringing their functionality closer to that of their Android cousins.  In-app bitcoin purchases  It's not just wallet apps finding new approval from Apple; others have appeared that allow bitcoin purchases from within the app, which also appear to avoid Apple's 30% share of all in-app purchase amounts rule.  The eGifter app, for example, now allows users to purchase its gift cards directly with bitcoin, making the dream of spending bitcoin on Walmart purchases via an iOS device – impossible just a week or so ago – a reality.  The first iOS app to allow in-app bitcoin spending was the simple betting game Betcoin, which appeared almost immediately after Apple's announcement. Its developer, Omri Cohen, said it was partly an experiment to test what Apple would allow, and was actually submitted before Apple's change of heart to a more favorable bitcoin attitude.
