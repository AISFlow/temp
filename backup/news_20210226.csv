42386044,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBQu5L,1614374695,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Heads for Worst Week Since March as Prices Hold Around $46.5K,"Bitcoin’s price turned choppy on Friday as the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization logged its worst weekly performance since March 2020 when the pandemic hit the global economy.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $46,244 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 5.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $44,180.99-$49,325.91 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades below its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.    A quick recap of bitcoin’s most tumultuous weekly performance since almost a year ago shows that this week’s high volatility was not caused by one simple factor. The correction earlier this week was largely triggered by an overheated derivatives market as traders rushed to exit leveraged bets (or got liquidated from positions) that had accumulated as bitcoin pushed to an all-time-high price above $58,000. A drop below $45,000 on Thursday coincided with a sell-off in the broader stock market due to rising concerns over surging bond yields, which might dim the allure of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.      Read more: Bitcoin Looks Indecisive After Sell-off in Bonds, Tech Stocks      Bitcoin’s spot market looked quiet on Friday, with the daily trading volume on eight crypto exchanges tracked by CoinDesk largely flat compared with levels on Thursday. Volume spiked during the sell-off earlier this week after large bitcoin inflows to exchanges such as Gemini on Sunday, which signaled an intent by some traders to take profits as prices approached $60,000.      The market’s relatively quiet tone Friday appeared to reflect low anxiety over a key month-end expiration date on options contracts. A notional total of about $3 billion worth of bitcoin options contracts expired on Friday and the strike price with the highest open interest stood at $48,000, according to derivatives data site Skew.      “Typically, with options, the highest strike price continues to have a pull on the underlying’s spot price, which could partly explain bitcoin’s recent price action,” said Hunain Naseer, senior editor at OKEx Insights. “Now, with those options contracts out of the way, the market appears, in the short term, to be free to pick a direction.”      “Despite the narrative being sold by crypto maximalists that digital assets are a safe-haven asset, the use of bitcoin suggests it is more of a risk asset,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant.      “Thus, liquidity events such those witnessed this week in equity markets will subsequently feed into digital assets, even if fundamentally the two are not related,” Vinokourov said. “Cash is king in times of distress, not bitcoin.”      Read more: Grayscale Bitcoin Premium Flips Negative as BTC Stays Below $50,000      Others have remained optimistic after this week’s high volatility.      “Right now, one of the most interesting aspects of bitcoin is that it has no fundamentals to base a valuation model on, but its price movements do correlate with social sentiment,” said Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director at trading platform eToro. “Shifts in social sentiment can be indicators of price movements, and inform investors about short-term movements.”      “Long term, though, we do feel that it is a 'safe haven' in the sense that there is no way to artificially deflate it or otherwise manipulate it, and that is a perfectly good reason for people to invest in it,” Hirsch said.      Recent blockchain data showed that more investors were accumulating bitcoin as seen by a huge amount of bitcoin outflow from institution-driven crypto exchange Coinbase Pro, according to CryptoQuant, a data provider.    Ether moves in tandem with bitcoin amid a quiet market    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down on Friday, trading around $1,446.2 and sliding 8.2% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Ether tumbled to nearly $1,400 during Friday’s trading hours in Asia and has been hovering around $1,450 for most of Friday.

42386021,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBQtlD,1614372103,"Grayscale Bitcoin Premium Flips Negative as BTC Stays Below $50,000","The largest public bitcoin trust is facing an unusual situation: Its share price is dropping faster than the underlying cryptocurrency.    Historically, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) trades at a premium to bitcoin (BTC) itself. But that premium turned into a discount this week, with GBTC closing at a price nearly 4% lower than the market value of the underlying asset on Thursday.  In mid-December, GBTC shares traded at more than a 35% premium, according to data from YCharts, a reminder that price action for GBTC doesn't perfectly match bitcoin's own price action by any means.  NOTE: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.  Grayscale's bitcoin trust isn't the only one trading at a discount, however. 3iQ's Canadian Bitcoin Fund (QBTC), although a smaller fund than Grayscale, was also trading at a roughly 4% discount to its underlying asset, according to market data from CryptoQuant.  GBTC and QBTC are trading at discounts as bitcoin itself is selling off, dropping to below $45,000 Friday afternoon before slightly recovering to above $48,000.  At last check, BTC was trading at $46,877, based on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, with a year-to-date gain just below 60%.  Analysts have speculated the shrinking premium might be due to reduced demand for bitcoin, or due to increasing competition among providers of bitcoin-focused exchange-traded products.

42386043,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBQu45,1614371475,A Guide to Saving on Bitcoin's High Transaction Fees,"It was inevitable. Now that bitcoin is in a bull run and more users are rushing to use the digital currency, bitcoin transaction fees are shooting up again. Lately, the average bitcoin transaction fee has fluctuated between $24 and $31, according to data provider Bitinfocharts.      Higher fees emerge when the blockchain is congested. The blockchain has limited space. Like a traffic jam, the transactions move more slowly when the lanes are filled.      The number of transactions that are waiting in line to be accepted by the network has ballooned significantly over the last couple of months, as the above graph shows.      Users need to pay the Bitcoin network’s miners a fee to get their transactions accepted. Attaching a higher fee to your transaction will likely get it through faster because miners have more incentive to include more profitable transactions in the blocks they mine. These fees also promote a healthier and more secure network because they pay miners and encourage them to participate in the process. These miners are an essential part of Bitcoin's security behind the scenes.    Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works    Luckily, there are ways to cut down on the costs, if you're patient enough to learn how the Bitcoin blockchain works and the right tools to use.    Option #1: Wait it out    If you have time on your side, there are a couple of options to consider.      Look for a time when the blockchain is less congested. On the weekend, for example, businesses are closed and fewer overall transactions are made. This gives transactions a little more space to clear.      Alternatively, try sending your transaction with a smaller fee, then wait until it clears.      Though the average Bitcoin transaction may be around $25, for example, the median is closer to what most users will likely need to pay.      At that rate, if you want to send a transaction right away, the fastest transaction fee is currently around 102 satoshis/byte, according to bitcoinfees.earn. For a median transaction size of 224 bytes, this results in a fee of 22,848 satoshis, or $11. If you don't mind waiting roughly a half hour, the price would be 83 satoshis/byte, or about $9. The price continues to slide down from there if you're willing to wait even longer.      Note that for this strategy to work, you’ll need to choose a wallet that allows users to set custom transaction fees. Most do but some don't, so just make sure the wallet you're using supports setting custom fees.      Also, note that this strategy can be a little risky. If your fee is too low, the transaction could get stuck temporarily or won't go through at all.      If you're worried about this scenario, you can check a site like mempool.space to get a feel for recommended current bitcoin transaction fees. The site shows fee suggestions for low-, medium- or high-priority transactions. The higher-priority fees will push the transactions through faster. But if you aren't in a rush, you can choose a lower fee and wait for it to be included eventually.      In addition, under the ""purging"" header, mempool.space shows at what fee price the Bitcoin network will effectively ignore the transaction.      If you’re not sure if you are setting the fee high enough (but don’t want to overpay), and if your wallet offers this option, make your fee “replaceable” by selecting ""Replace-By-Fee (RBF)."" This will allow you to bump up the amount of the bitcoin fee you set even after sending the transaction if you find it’s taking too long to go through. But, again, only some wallets support the feature, including Blockstream Green and Electrum.    Option #2: Lightning to the rescue    Developers have long anticipated the scenario of rising transaction fees as more users swarm to Bitcoin. That's one reason they're building the Lightning Network, a network that sits on top of Bitcoin to allow the network to support more transactions, relieving congestion.      For comparison, while the average on-chain bitcoin transaction fee may cost $25, the average fee on Lightning is a fraction of a cent.      This is the best long-term solution for users planning to make several transactions in the future.      With Lightning, the user does need to pay a fee when initially setting up the channel. But after that, they'll be able to send as many transactions as they want (assuming they have enough money in their account) with lower fees.      Back to our traffic jam analogy. Users need to get through the initial traffic jam. But with Lightning they will be able to bypass the traffic jam completely by using another alternative lane just for them. And they can do this as many times as they want.      Again, not all wallets support Lightning transactions. In fact, the most popular ones, such as Coinbase and Blockchain.com, don't. Try looking into a Lightning-specific wallet instead such as Phoenix, Breez and BlueWallet.      At least for now, there are some further caveats. For one, Lightning is still new and not everyone accepts this type of payment. So, whether it is useful to users depends on whether they're making payments to accounts that accept Lightning – or if they can convince those receiving payments to use it.      Not to mention, Lightning is still experimental. While the technology has matured over the last couple of years, there's still a possibility users could lose funds. In other words, users shouldn't put their life savings in it.    Option #3: Use wallets with scaling technology    Back in the realm of on-chain bitcoin transaction fees: SegWit transactions, a change adopted by the Bitcoin community in 2017, can charge fees that are up to 30% cheaper than legacy transactions. In other words, if a legacy transaction costs $15, a SegWit transaction could cost as little as $10.50, in a best-case scenario.      Though SegWit has been around for a while now, not all wallets and exchanges have gotten around to adopting this type of transaction.      On top of SegWit, bech32 addresses add even more improvements and decrease fees a little more as well. Some services have adopted SegWit transactions but not bech32, a format specifically made for SegWit transactions.      SegWit, bech32 – all these different changes are confusing. If you're just looking to get a discount on fees, take a look at this list or this list of wallets and exchanges. The more checkmarks or green squares an entity has, the higher the discount on fees you'll likely see when using the app. (Note: These lists might not be fully up to date. Some more recent SegWit adopters, such as BitPay, have not made these lists yet.)      That said, SegWit is not necessarily the default type of transaction in wallets that support it. Users will need to make sure to specifically select the SegWit option when creating their wallet to make sure they can send bitcoin transactions with lower fees.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/26/a-guide-to-saving-on-bitcoins-high-transaction-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca1884e99bdc2b0304eeeea9022cfc37d57d3b40-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In response, developers have activated their emergency switch to temporarily disable Lelantus to give them time to investigate and identify the issue.      In a post last night announcing the issue, Yap wrote:      “Our core team is working with several parties, including engineers from Trail of Bits (who audited our Lelantus cryptographic library), another cryptographer and a black hat to identify the issue. We have made significant progress in narrowing down the cause and are working on a proof-of-concept code to verify that what we’ve found is the core issue before resuming Lelantus functionality. Our team is also determining a plan to restore Lelantus functionality with minimum impact.”    Read more: Privacy Coin Firo Launches ‘Privacy by Default’ Protocol on Mainnet    The Lelantus protocol was launched in mid-January 2021.

Naming custody, record keeping, registration requirements and conflicts of interest protocols on their exhaustive list of focus areas, officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Division of Examinations reminded mainstream financial players like broker-dealers and investment advisors to tread carefully when bringing digital asset products into the traditional financial world.      The release, which did not appear to be targeted at any one event, nonetheless comes as ever more U.S. corporates grapple with how to handle their digital asset endeavors without stoking regulatory ire.      On one end of this spectrum is MicroStrategy's ban on employees trading bitcoin ahead of potentially market-moving corporate buys. And on the other is Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who yesterday expressed hope that rumors are true the SEC is investigating his DOGE tweets, which tend to precede with price jumps.      SEC examiners framed the notice as a reminder of the novel risks associated with distributed ledger technologies and digital assets, and of the responsibilities market participants have to hedge those risks with thorough compliance frameworks.      Many of their focus examination points simply reapply traditional bookkeeping practices to crypto investments. But other examination areas appear more novel.

According to a press statement published by the bank on Thursday, the sandbox will cover a broad spectrum of innovations in the financial services sector, targeting women and improving financial inclusion in the country. The bank is on the lookout for remittance products, crowdfunding products and services, e-KYC (electronic know your customer) platforms and new merchant payment solutions for small to medium-sized businesses.      “The sandbox will be available to banks, specialized deposit-taking institutions and payment service providers including dedicated electronic money issuers as well as unregulated entities and persons that have innovations that meet the sandbox requirements,” the statement said.      The statement also said the Bank of Ghana wants to use this project “to reaffirm its commitment to addressing the financial inclusion needs of the unbanked and underserved persons and businesses.”      A Bank of Ghana representative told CoinDesk the institution will publish detailed requirements for prospective applicants soon, and that successful applicants will have 90 days to pilot their projects.      “The sandbox will admit innovations that have not been covered by all the existing statutes with regards to regulation of the payment ecosystem in Ghana. Entities with such innovations can put in an application to the Bank of Ghana for evaluation and consideration,” the representative said in an email to CoinDesk.

With its public filing, Coinbase has issued minimum viable standards for methods of operation, risk management and risk awareness in crypto, said David Mercer, CEO of London-based LMAX Group.      “It's gutsy to go and be listed in the U.S., with all the nefarious chatter about bitcoin and all the AML (anti-money laundering) procedures,” said Mercer in an interview. “I think if anyone else is considering it, if your policies and procedures and controls aren't at least up to that standard, you've got no chance.”      Retail crypto exchanges with about 10 million customers should be thinking about how they can meet that standard and go beyond it to differentiate themselves, Mercer added.      The arrival of institutional crypto has been one of the big themes in the last year or so. LMAX Digital has recorded over $5 billion in daily institutional crypto trading volume at times; earlier this week the exchange clocked close to $4.4 billion in daily volume.      According to its S-1 filing, Coinbase has aggressively expanded beyond retail trading to now accounting for close to 50% of its volume from institutional. (According to its S-1 document Coinbase has 7,000 institutions.)      Mercer pointed out the financial definition of an institution is a firm like Jump Trading or Cumberland, of which his firm has 400 such clients, and that could be narrowed down to 100 if you are talking about banks.      “That's one thing I'm gonna pick them up on,” Mercer said. “How do you define an institution? I think one man's one man's institution is another man's private investor.”      However, he acknowledged the crypto world makes such definitions fluid, adding that Coinbase is, to some degree, setting the rules.      However, one important factor that isn’t up for negotiation is no down time, said Mercer, pointing out that LMAX Group has had zero down time in seven years. Mercer's comment was no doubt a criticism of Coinbase's tendency last year to experience outages during periods of unusually heavy volume.      “There's an acceptance in the retail market that they have downtime when things get busy,” Mercer said. “Institutions expect 100% uptime. I can’t tell bank A in Chicago and say, ‘sorry guys, we’ve been really busy and just down here for a few minutes.’ They'll just pull my line and not trade with me.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/26/coinbase-has-set-a-high-bar-for-crypto-firms-looking-to-list-says-institutional-rival,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0190e8d2628bd29f31fc5ee8fd79ae2123d1958-1320x641.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405980,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAer81n,1614368210,Bitcoin Is Trading at a 46% Premium on Luno Nigeria After Central Bank Ban,"Nigeria's central bank restrictions on cryptocurrencies are still affecting exchanges operating in the African nation.      On Friday, bitcoin was trading at a 46% premium on Luno in Nigeria, meaning the price of one bitcoin on the exchange was much higher than its average price on other major exchanges of around $48,000 at the time. This is up from a 38% premium earlier in the week. Luno is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company.      Earlier this month, Nigeria’s central bank (CBN) prohibited local financial institutions from servicing crypto firms. The exchange said it was experiencing a drop in liquidity as a result of the ban. Marius Reitz, Luno's general manager for Africa, told CoinDesk that while liquidity issues don’t have a ""yes or no'' answer, ""the letter from the [Central Bank of Nigeria] caused a market shock.""      ""Luno still has liquidity, but it is a third of what it was previously,"" Reitz said.      Liquidity typically indicates a firm’s ability to pay off its short-term debt obligations. But in the context of cryptocurrency exchanges, liquidity reflects the ease with which a crypto asset can be converted to cash or other cryptocurrencies without influencing the asset’s price too much. Low liquidity makes this conversion more difficult, and drives the asset price up.      Typically, bitcoin prices on each exchange differs slightly depending on the exchange’s liquidity, as well as the fact that bitcoin, being a decentralized asset, has no standardized pricing.      Still, the price on Luno far exceeds what a typical range of prices might look like.    Central bank order    Although the ban wasn’t new, the central bank nonetheless ordered all local banks to shut down accounts tied to crypto firms. In response to the order, Binance Nigeria suspended Nigerian naira deposits on the platform, while Luno halted both withdrawals and deposits.      Luno is still not able to process deposits and withdrawals, Reitz said.      He added that immediately following the order, people were trying to sell bitcoin back to naira so they could withdraw funds to their personal accounts, and the central bank order led to lower demand for bitcoin. In fact, unable to maintain accounts with traditional exchanges, Nigerian crypto users began turning to peer-to-peer trading platforms.      “Now, as the price of bitcoin reaches new highs, because there aren't as many people buying [or] selling bitcoin in Nigeria as there were before, it can lead to periods of low liquidity causing price spikes and dips,” Reitz said in an email to CoinDesk.      Bitcoin is already trading at a slight premium on some exchanges in Nigeria, where the informal dollar rate and inflation can influence the prices. On Friday, the official U.S. dollar to naira exchange rate published by the Central Bank of Nigeria was 379 naira per $1. Meanwhile, bitcoin prices on a peer-to-peer platform Paxful reflected the informal dollar exchange rate in Nigeria: 475 naira for $1. On Luno, bitcoin was listed at around 33,000,000 naira, which meant $1 was worth around 690 naira. One Twitter user pointed out that one dollar was going for 700 naira on Feb. 20 on the platform. In other words, bitcoin could cost a user between $45,866 and $69,000 in Nigeria at the moment.      Another user (@MarufLawal) took to Twitter to raise his concerns about Luno’s high premium, going as far as to accuse the platform of manipulating prices.      “The current rate of [b]itcoin and all crypto on your platform doesn’t reflect reality,” the user said.      Luno doesn’t set the price of bitcoin or any cryptocurrencies available on the platform, Reitz said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/26/bitcoin-is-trading-at-a-46-premium-on-luno-nigeria-after-central-bank-ban,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e11235b144f15a97252e3c4105c6e14f37bc696-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405977,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAer7xr,1614367808,NBA Top Shot Overwhelmed by Demand in Record $1M Pack Drop,"Dapper Labs' booming digital collectibles platform, NBA Top Shot, just completed its most anticipated NFT release yet, selling 10,631 packs of basketball videos hashed to the Flow blockchain for a record $1.05 million in revenue.      The project’s latest pack drop, which at its peak had over 200,000 hopeful collectors waiting in line for what are essentially serialized National Basketball Association highlights, pushes total pack-generated revenue to $7.38 million for the 8-month-old NBA Top Shot, according to data crunched by CoinDesk.      The secondary market for Top Shot pack “moments” is even bigger: Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou said the platform has seen $50 million in transactions in the last 30 days. Some moments featuring top players have resold for six-figure sums.      “I think we're on track to be the fastest growing marketplace,” Gharegozlou said Friday.      Top Shot is quickly emerging as a breakthrough in the blockchain collectibles space. Though it has been around since June, the league-licensed project has gone off like a rocket in the past month as players pump the hype – and mainstream collectors pile in.      Indeed, the site has struggled mightily to keep up with surging demand.      Dapper Labs delayed this latest pack drop at least two times and shut off new sign-ins in an attempt to get a handle on back-end operations, ward off bots and keep the site (which is still in beta) rolling relatively smoothly. The firm was only somewhat successful; Friday’s drop experienced delays even after it began.    NFT full-court press    There’s no sign the NFT issuer is slowing down anytime soon. Built atop Dapper’s in-house Flow blockchain, the project has blasted into mainstream sports culture in recent weeks with NBA stars and owners like Mark Cuban calling Top Shot’s “moments” the next big thing.      It has gotten to the point where players all but plead with the public for gifts of the digital sports cards. Other NBA stars invested directly in Dapper Labs in earlier rounds. The startup reportedly raised $250 million at a $2 billion valuation earlier this month.      NBA Top Shot is leading an entire digital collectible ecosystem in a charge toward the normies. That it lives atop a walled blockchain powered by tokenomics is largely irrelevant to its swelling user base, who, unfazed by the decentralized backend, have signed up in droves. Notably, NBA Top Shot moments are making their first foray out of the Flow garden and onto the OpenSea marketplace among the many Ethereum-based NFTs.      “The FLOW token is what powers it all, but you don't need to know that in order to play NBA Top shot,” Gharegozlou said during the pack drop livestream. “There's nothing about cryptocurrency. It's about basketball, and the crypto technology is simply what enables the software to exist.”      RELATED:",POSITIVE,FLOW,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | FLOW,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/26/nba-top-shot-overwhelmed-by-demand-in-record-1m-pack-drop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9887a66c059dfdea0c578d893e38d4c9849b2f19-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We're pleased to let you know that we've recently reviewed your YouTube account, and after taking another look, we can confirm that it is not in violation of our Terms of Service,"" the platform said in an email.      A spokesperson told CoinDesk's reporter: ""When it’s brought to our attention that content has been removed mistakenly, we act quickly to reinstate it. We also allow uploaders to easily appeal removals.""      CoinDesk is pleased not to offend YouTube.      Video streaming platform YouTube knocked CoinDesk's channel offline Thursday, allegedly for breaching its policies.    Citing ""severe or repeated violations"" of its community guidelines, YouTube removed CoinDesk's channel, which had more than 21,000 subscribers.  ""Content that encourages illegal activities or incites users to violate YouTube's guidelines is not allowed on YouTube,"" the platform wrote in an email to CoinDesk without elaborating.  YouTube also cut off the livestream of CoinDesk TV's daily show ""All About Bitcoin"" during the broadcast, claiming it violated the platform's ""harmful and dangerous"" policy.  CoinDesk has filed multiple appeals, with no direct response from YouTube as of press time. At least one appeal was rejected for administrative reasons.  ""We're attempting to get in direct touch with YouTube,"" said CoinDesk CEO Kevin Worth in a statement. ""As an independent, trusted media company around since 2013, we take very seriously our ability to publish timely market information and are trying to understand what exactly the issue is.""  YouTube did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk reporter's request for comment.  YouTube has suspended cryptocurrency accounts perceived to be in violation of website policies, including the same bar against ""harmful and dangerous policy,"" only to issue mea culpas in the past.

42405990,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAer89f,1614361272,Money Reimagined: COVID Economy Shows Monetary Failure,"Welcome to Money Reimagined.      A lot of red in crypto markets this week. The sell-off has likely given pause to latecomers. Among crypto old-timers, however, there are no real signs of panic. No one’s talking – not yet, at least – about a rerun of 2018 when bitcoin, ether and large swaths of the token universe suffered a violent reversal from the previous year’s ICO-fueled crypto boom. It’s seen as more of a correction or a pause than the start of another protracted bear market.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    One reason for that is discussed in this week’s column: COVID-19 has exposed the failings of our financial system and crypto offers an alternative to it. Another is that one pocket of the crypto universe is suddenly capturing mainstream attention and seeing an explosion of creativity among software designers and artists: non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.      NFTs are the theme of this week’s episode of our “Money Reimagined” podcast, the second in a three-part series on the topic. This week, Sheila Warren and I interviewed Lethabo Huma, a brilliant, innovative digital artist from South Africa, and Visa’s head of crypto, Cuy Sheffield, who is a trailblazing NFT collector and supporter of up-and-coming Black artists. To spice things up, we took the show onto Clubhouse for the first time.      Have a listen. After reading the newsletter below.    Two-speed economy tells of monetary failure    Since January 2020:    Global COVID-19 deaths: 2.5 million  Global work-hours lost: equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs, according to the ILO  Contraction in the global economy: 4.3%, according to World Bank estimates  Emergency monetary expansion by the Federal Reserve: $3.4 trillion  S&P 500 total valuation: up by $6.8 trillion  Return for the MSCI emerging market index: 21%  U.S. house prices: up 10.4%, per Case-Shiller index  Bitcoin price gain: 60%.    This week’s grim milestone of the U.S. surpassing 500,000 COVID-19 deaths, almost one year since its first one, prompts an accounting of how this devastating global experience has played out in real-world and financial settings.      Per the data above, there’s an almost unreal bifurcation in outcomes. As measured in human lives affected by simultaneous health and economic crises, Main Street has suffered badly. Yet, at the same time, holders of physical, financial and digital assets have enjoyed spectacular returns.      My point is not to highlight the unfairness – as indisputable as that is – but to point out something even more troubling: the ultimate failure of the financial capitalist system that now drives big Western economies like the U.S.      This failure is why we stand at the cusp of a momentous change in money and why, even with the volatility of crypto and bitcoin prices this week, interest will continue to be directed at this transformative technology.    Efficient markets?    The story we were told throughout the 20th century was that in a capitalist society markets enable allocation of capital to where it’s most effective. The role of government was to intervene only insofar as its actions improved the efficiency of markets and assured broad-based access without privilege to special interests.       The principle was that regulation should not add unnecessary barriers to competition and in some cases, such as in antitrust actions, should proactively force monopolists to remove such barriers. Most important, regulators should ensure control over the information underpinning market decisions wasn’t systematically skewed in favor of some over others.      Much of this was based on the “efficient market hypothesis,” which holds that markets efficiently process all information available to quickly set prices that capture the state of the world and provide a valuable signal for capital allocation.      Freed from information distortions, asset prices were supposed to rise on good news and fall on bad. Since those prices represented the consensus of multiple responses to that information, they would incentivize solutions that are, on balance, best for everyone.    Market failure    The efficient market hypothesis was convincingly debunked after the 2008 financial crisis. So, one might assume the contradiction between COVID-era financial information and prices offers another case of its failings. After all, stock prices, which are supposed to reflect expectations for future earnings, surged to record highs at the same time that the global economy underwent its worst contraction since the Great Depression.      But in this case, markets more or less processed information properly. The problem is a different one. It’s that there was another, hugely offsetting piece of information that affected investors’ decision-making: massive monetary expansion.      Central banks’ announcements and executions of “quantitative easing” programs made stocks and other assets valuable for two reasons.      First, they drove interest rates on many forms of debt down close to zero. So, even if nominal future corporate earnings were now sharply lower, they were relatively attractive compared with returns on bonds.      Second, because the Fed offered no end date to its program – a notion dubbed as “infinite QE” – the dollar monetary expansion mathematically inflated the value of finite assets denominated in the dollars.      The new money had to go into stores-of-value whose supply wasn’t expanding. Stocks were favored for their liquidity. But so, too, were assets that were less liquid but had even tighter constraints on supply, such as real estate and fine art – and lately, scarce digital art. (See the “Conversation” below.)      Over time, this monolithic idea of a rapidly and relentlessly expanding money supply overwhelmed all other unique forms of non-financial information.      It made investors less discerning, creating ever-tighter correlations across assets, a trend toward sameness. Stock picking was increasingly driven by non-fundamental factors, such as the collective action of Redditors driving up the “meme stocks” of economically troubled companies such as GameStop.      And it meant younger investors, facing a future of zero interest rates, would say things like this:      This, in a nutshell, is the failure of financial capitalism: a system that makes no distinctions between alternative investments can’t allocate capital effectively.      This, in a nutshell, is the failure of financial capitalism: a system that makes no distinctions between alternative investments can’t allocate capital effectively.    Bitcoin as truth teller    To be sure, central bankers could posit that price data do accurately reflect economic expectations because their policy measures are putting a floor on the downturn and setting the economy up for a rebound.      But that’s not how a vast swath of humanity sees things. This disjuncture between real-world and financial information – see the chart in the section below, for example – tells a simple, brutal tale. Central bank rescue efforts have overwhelmingly favored a narrow class of well-off asset owners and done close to nothing for the majority.      An even more important rebuttal to the central bankers’ argument can be found in the huge price runup for bitcoin since late March.      Bitcoin is a non-yielding asset. You buy it to exit fiat. For now at least, until better payment rails and decentralized financial solutions can be built on top of it, that’s its main purpose. It’s not a bet on economic recovery. If anything, it’s the opposite.      As we’ve discussed before, the price of bitcoin is an information signal telling policymakers about the level of confidence, or lack thereof, in the financial system. It’s time they paid attention to it.    Job losses, stock market wins    To illustrate this information disjuncture, let’s look at what has traditionally been the most important monthly economic indicator for Wall Street: the nonfarm payrolls report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.      As expressed in terms of total employment, you can see that the U.S. labor market is still deeply “in the red” from where it was before the pandemic led to sudden lockdowns and a major shock to the global economy in March last year. Not so the S&P 500 index.      While the stock market’s initial Spring recovery correlated with a modest three-month rebound in employment, what’s most notable is that, after that, as the jobs recovery lost luster and failed to regain 10 million lost positions, equities just kept rising and rising and rising.    The conversation: NFT mania    February 2021 may go down as the month that non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, burst into the public consciousness.      With Christie’s planning an auction of digital art megastar Mike ""Beeple"" Winkelmann’s work, a tokenized version of Chris Torres’ legendary “Nyan cat” meme selling for 300 ETH ($453,000 at time of print), and the NBA’s Top Shot game selling an NFT of a clip of New Orleans Pelicans player Zion Williamson for $100,000, the entertainment world is abuzz with this trend. As we’ll see from the conversation this week, some are over the moon with it, others aren’t convinced.      Someone who is excited is Mark Cuban. The Dallas Mavericks owner, “Shark Tank” star and influential investor told CNBC that if he were to launch a business right now, it would be in the NFT space. Here he is explaining why he thinks digital scarce rights will foment a revolution that goes beyond arts and entertainment:      Here’s a revealing thread from an NFT digital art collector explaining his logic. What’s interesting is the focus on buying early versions of the various new NFT art forms, such as the fascinating genre of “generative art” made by algorithms. That way, the collector owns an early piece of history – not unlike the mindset applied to antiques.      Meanwhile, major-league-baseballer-turned artist and black empowerment activist Micah Johnson launched the #AKU project, raising money for up-and-coming artists. The winner of the first auction of an NFT attached to a physical sculpture gets unique, exclusive access to it via a vault in Miami.      But is there any real there there? What is unique and enforceable about NFT-enforced rights to digital art? Bram Cohen, who as the founder of BitTorrent knows something about how rights to creative works move around then internet, asks some tough questions:      Meanwhile, a voice from the old art world, the influential New York Magazine critic Jerry Saltz, pours snobbish scorn on the whole scene (though it’s not clear he knows what NFTs are):      I ask you, how can a movement that produces something like this not be a big deal.    Relevant reads: CBDC war begins?    Meanwhile, a bit of fuel was thrown onto the flickering flames of an impending “digital currency war” between the U.S. and China, with both now accelerating their work on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).    After years of U.S. officials showing little urgency for a digital dollar, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is now saying this is going to be an “important year” in its development. Nathan DiCamillo reports.   Shortly thereafter, as Daniel Nelson and Nikhilesh De report, some Fed officials released a paper outlining a process for consulting and engaging the general public in the design and development of the digital dollar. It’s fair to say this level of open public participation is not part of the Chinese development of its digital yuan, though entire cities such as Shenzhen have been used for pilots.   Why the expediting of activity in the U.S.? It’s not entirely clear, but notably it comes as China and the United Arab Emirates join a partnership with the Bank of Thailand and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to form a regional CBDC payments system, Jamie Crawley reports. This is being described as a system to bypass the dollar-centric global payment system run by SWIFT. Such initiatives could one day diminish demand for the dollar as the world’s reserve currency.   And in another sign of CBDC technology going live, the East Caribbean Central Bank, the monetary authority for nine states, announced it had conducted the first transaction in its DCash digital currency. The payment, coordinated with the central bank’s provider, Bitt, occurred in a supermarket in Grenada. Jamie Crawley reports.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Michael J.

The much anticipated set of rules, set down in 2019 but not fully implemented, would see increased reporting requirements for some crypto service providers in an attempt to stem illicit use of crypto. The anti-money laundering watchdog now says it’s looking for input, though is confident the data sharing requirements will roll out by June.      Crypto uncentered Crypto was not the center of attention at a congressional hearing on terror financing, yesterday. Members of the House Financial Services Committee gathered to discuss data gathering, surveillance and domestic terror statutes for an increasingly digital world. And while crypto came up, no new provisions were suggested to prevent criminal abuse of these tools, CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De reports.      Inflows slow Canadian Bitcoin ETF inflows have slowed amid a recent price slough. Bloomberg had projected the fast-growing Purpose Bitcoin ETF could hit $1 billion by the end of this week, but as of Friday the assets were less than $700 million. The ETF has collected just 1,766 BTC since Tuesday versus 8,288 BTC in the first two trading days, CoinDesk Senior Reporter Omkar Godbole said. (Purpose's indexes are provided by CoinDesk subsidiary TradeBlock.)      Kraken's $10B+ Kraken is reportedly valued at least $10 billion and possibly even more than $20 billion, depending on demand. According to Bloomberg, the exchange is currently in discussions with Fidelity, Tribe Capital and General Atlantic to raise an unknown sum. It was last valued at $4 billion in 2019, after crowdsourcing a raise.      Move fast, or break things The U.K. Treasury has released a new report that highlights the need to launch a new regime for the regulation and administration of crypto assets, lest the nation lose its fintech lead. The report titled “Kalifa Review of U.K. Fintech,” looks to create a “bespoke” and “innovation-driven” set of rules to guide the world in crypto regulation. Perhaps they should watch Wyoming, which introduced a bill to integrate blockchain into certain state functions.    At stake    Coinbase’s competition Coinbase’s filing to go public yesterday was a treasure trove of insight into one of the most significant global cryptocurrency exchanges. According to its S-1, the exchange boasts 43 million verified users, approximately 3 million of whom use the platform on a monthly basis.      Most notably were details of the competitive arena in which Coinbase sees itself and the exchange’s path to profitability. According to the filing, Coinbase’s business is highly tied to market prices. It pulled in profit of $322 million on $1.3 billion in revenue in 2020 amid a record market rally, but lost $30 million on $533 million in revenue the year before during a slump.      “Our operating results have, and will continue to, fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in accordance with market sentiments,” the company said.      Founded in Silicon Valley in 2012 by current CEO Brian Armstrong and former president and current director Fred Ehrsam, Coinbase also sees a growing threat from quick-moving exchanges operating in less-regulated corridors and the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) field.      As CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported, the company called out Binance by name, saying it was potentially its “least regulated and most formidable competitor.” It further cited compliance costs and the potential for “administrative sanctions for technical violations” pegged to the U.S. Treasury Department’s coming “travel rule” as a potential risks to growth.      These same regulations could inhibit its ability to compete with decentralized alternatives like Uniswap, CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reported. “Such platforms have low startup and entry costs as market entrants often remain unregulated and have minimal operating and regulatory costs,” the company wrote.      While decentralized alternatives do offer some benefits to users, like the ability to trade without counterparties and relaxed identification requirements, DeFi is still a small market. The total value of all DeFi apps is estimated at $40 billion, less than half of the value of the assets on Coinbase.      “All of our sources of revenue are dependent on crypto assets and the broader cryptoeconomy,” the filing reads. “There is no assurance that any supported crypto asset will maintain its value or that there will be meaningful levels of trading activities. In the event that the price of crypto assets or the demand for trading crypto assets decline, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.”    Sound bites    Crypto is not just a speculative asset in Latin America, according to Daniel Vogel, chief executive of Bitso, of one the region’s largest exchanges. Appearing on CoinDesk TV, Vogel said crypto and blockchain applications are being used exactly as advertised.      Remittances are increasingly being sent using stablecoins, while an increasing number of people are leveraging decentralized financial apps to earn interest on or safeguard their wealth, he said.      “Suddenly you have this technology that people can access on their cell phones, regardless of where they are, their proximity to a local banking branch. We believe it will completely change the name of the game,” Vogel said.      One notable data point? Bitso would be “Mexico’s seventh-largest bank by number of customers,” Vogel claimed.

At press time, the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands at $47,921, down 6.2% in the past 24 hours, based on CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Since 12:00 a.m. UTC (7 p.m. ET), the price is up 1.6%.      On the hourly chart, bitcoin was trading between its 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages, a sideways signal for market technicians.      After the No. 1 cryptocurrency failed to reclaim the key psychological threshold of $50,000, prices dropped sharply along with equities markets across the globe as investors fretted over surging yields on U.S. Treasury bonds.      “The recent rise in long-dated U.S. Treasury yields, particularly at the long end of the curve such as the US 10-year Treasury yields, is indicative of higher growth and inflation expectations, which is starting to put pressure on tech valuations,” Kevin Kelly, co-founder of crypto research firm Delphi Digital, said. “Market volatility has also started to pick up again, which historically has coincided with short-term weakness in bitcoin.”      “If we continue to see equities slide, this may be problematic for crypto and result in another pullback,” said Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier.

42405989,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAer88g,1614349800,How Hashmasks Are Setting the Standard for Digital Art,"At the beginning of February, whispers on Discord quickly turned into a parabolic price chart for digital art project Hashmasks – an output of curiously named Zurich-based Suum Cuique Labs.      The headlines soon followed:    “Latest Ethereum Craze Hashmasks Sells 16,000 NFTs for $9 Million,” Decrypt wrote on Feb. 3.  “Rare Hashmasks Digital Artwork Sells for $650K in Ether,” one CoinDesk article followed up the next day.    Suum Cuique Labs’ first project is an attempt to bridge the gap among digital communities which have sprung up in the age of lockdowns and high-speed internet access. Its collection of abstract portraits is perhaps the best example of a $350 million industry quickly making its way to the mainstream through celebrity endorsements from people as lofty as Mark Cuban.      The project falls into a niche of blockchain-based applications called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These tokens, which mostly reside on the Ethereum network, act similarly to an old stock certificate: You are given a token when you buy a Hashmasks. That token is a public claim of ownership to digital art that resides in private hands.    Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?    Yet, Hashmasks and other digital artwork suffers from one nagging quip: Can’t you just screenshot it?      Yes, you could. But this question misses how digital art came to be, in and of itself. New digital communities like Hashmasks want to relate, build and grow together. And that’s simply not possible in the online world of yesterday’s social media giants. Digital art extends online norms we’ve all become accustomed to by introducing digital ownership. To own a Hashmask is to be part of a new community.    Behind the mask    Hashmasks was the creation of a particular community, not a product designed for a community, said “John Doe,” the co-creator of the digital art project, who requested anonymity for this interview with CoinDesk. He and his co-founder, who also asked to remain hidden, are both digital natives, one being a Solidity engineer and the other a researcher at a digital asset manager.      How did they know what to build?      “We are the exact target audience. We just build what we would like. We didn't have to do any analysis on people’s preferences because it's just us,” Doe said. “We hang in the same Discords.”      Doe’s passion work – borderless exchange of value – reflects his upbringing. He explained how he was raised in Berlin, attended high school state-side in Arizona, received his Masters in Economics in London before finally settling in Zurich. While he became interested in cryptocurrencies before the 2017 bull run, he only got into the NFT market this past summer.      “I feel mostly German, I think,” he added.    What’s a Hashmask?    The duo spared no expense either. Each of the 16,000 plus pieces is unique, the result of 8 months preparation and collaboration with some 70 artists from around Europe, Doe said. The compositions leaned heavily on Jean-Michel Basquiat’s work in New York City during the 1980s, Doe added.      Each portrait has six features: a character, a mask, an eye color, a skin tone, an item and a background. Those features divide into further categories such as a lion or a dragon character, he said.      A few other features separate Hashmasks from other NFTs. First, the community designates rarity to each mask. Second, Hashmasks has a second token, the Name Changing Token (NCT). And third, there are hidden messages left in each Hashmask.      The original purchase of the 16,000 Hashmasks was completely random, even to Doe and his co-founder. Hashmasks could be purchased in tiers with each level costing a different amount of ether (ETH), Doe said. The rarity of a Hashmask then developed organically, Doe said, based on the portrait’s features. The highest grossing Hashmask, for instance, garnered $650,000 even though the original buyer only spent 0.5 ether worth some $750 at press time on the painting.    Read more: Rare Hashmasks Digital Artwork Sells for $650K in Ether    NCTs also act as a way for collectors to get involved with their work. Each Hashmask has an associated token that allows the artwork to have its name changed within certain limits. The naming tokens allow owners to build art on top of Hashmasks as a complement to the entire project, Doe said.      Lastly, hidden messages are embedded in many Hashmasks. For example, there’s a royal flush scattered across multiple pieces, Doe said. Puzzles and messages spread across Hashmasks creates community interaction and adds rarity, Doe said.      “We built the first collectable, in my view, where the rarity hierarchy is not solely determined by the creators,” Doe said. “This is not endemic to NFTs.”    Art goes digital    Digital art means different things to different people. For art critic Joshua Drake, NFT-based work most likely lends itself to what he called “posing”: collecting art as a method of reputation building.      “I have this work of digital art because it makes me seem a [certain] way in a digital community,” Drake said in a phone interview.      Posing holds value in the flesh-and-blood art world as well. For example, a politician's collection subtly nudges viewers toward the owner’s authority in all things tasteful, he said.      As a technology, NFTs act as a seal of ownership on a particular creation, assembly of words or even collection of beats at a particular moment in time. That seal is valuable because a community says so, in much the same manner as bitcoin proponents argue the cryptocurrency itself has gained “moneyness.”    Read more: It’s an NFT Boom. Do You Know Where Your Digital Art Lives?    That’s not unlike traditional art, ConsenSys CMO Lex Sokolin said in a recent self-published newsletter:      “The 'Mona Lisa' is original and valuable. A poster of the Mona Lisa is not valuable, despite being nearly identical in visual information ... Therefore, the art is valuable not for its collection of particular atoms in some particular order, but for its historical and social context. Recreating the object does nothing, because it does not contain the same social history.      “With digital NFTs, the same logic is true. Just because you have an identical JPEG to the one anchored to the blockchain, does not mean you have an original worth anything, nor does your ability to look at it suggest anything from a collectible point of view.”    Where to next?    But where does it go from here? Are Hashmasks caught up in the “everything bubble” many crypto-leaning economists worry about? Or are they the beginnings of a way of representing ownership in a digital world?      A proliferation of online art is not necessarily a disadvantage to the NFT marketplace, Drake said. Rather, NFTs may experience a similar timeline to that of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Shoddy NFT projects will fall apart and winners will eventually appear, he said.      Doe said he expects the NFT market itself to keep growing.

Purpose Investments' Toronto-listed Bitcoin ETF, launched Feb. 19, held 10,064 BTC on Thursday. While that looks to be an impressive first-week growth, the pace of increase in holdings has slowed in the past three days.      The ETF has collected just 1,766 BTC since Tuesday versus 8,288 BTC in the first two trading days, according to data source Glassnode. In dollar terms, the AUM has increased by just $60 million in the past three days to $624 million compared to $564 million in the first two days.      Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas had predicted that the ETF's AUM would rise to $1 billion by the end of this week. Essentially, the fund needs to collect at least $376 million by Friday's closing bell. The ETF trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker “BTCC” and charges a management fee of 1%. Purpose's index information is provided by TradeBlock, a CoinDesk subsidiary.      The inflows have slowed in the wake of bitcoin's price pullback. The cryptocurrency peaked above $58,000 late Sunday and has been falling ever since. At press time, the cryptocurrency is down nearly 20% for the week at $46,300.

42405968,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAer7sw,1614346200,Chinese Companies That Have Nothing to Do With Crypto Are Pivoting to Mining,"Baked goods and tea. Emergency rescue. Online lotteries. These are some of the products and services offered by U.S.-listed Chinese companies that have pivoted to bitcoin mining in recent months, trying to capitalize on the current bull run.      This is not just short-term opportunism. Access to Chinese miners, state-owned energy providers and the U.S. capital markets make these companies well-positioned to swiftly expand mining operations. They can also earn high premiums in the stock market, according to industry pros.      These companies’ connections to Chinese bitcoin miner makers, local hosting mining sites and state-run electricity companies give them an edge over their competitors in the west, said Ethan Vera, CFO of Seattle-based crypto mining company Luxor.      “Some of the companies are partially owned by the Chinese government. They could get permits to operate in hydro power-rich areas or great deals with state-run electricity companies,” Vera said.      For example, Shenzhen-based lottery firm 500.com, which used to profit from helping China’s state-run lottery centers sell tickets, has signed contracts with the State Grid Corporation of China, a state-owned energy company, to enjoy discounted electricity for its data centers. The company’s subsidiary, Loto Interactive, also has permits to run data centers in the “excessive hydro power” areas designated by the local government in Sichuan and the Tibetan autonomous region.      Adding bitcoin mining to these companies’ businesses can significantly boost their valuation multiples, said Yulong Liu, managing director at Babel Finance, which is a Hong Kong-based crypto lender.      “These stocks are trading at a very high premium,” Liu said.    Bitcoin premium    Shares of Nasdaq-listed Chinese online gaming company The9, which had the exclusive license to distribute World of Warcraft in China, rose by over 750% year to date after it announced plans to make investments in crypto in January. Sino-Global Shipping, an international shipping company that said it would invest in bitcoin mining, gained over 300% on its stock price on Feb. 3. SOS, a Chinese emergency services provider, had an over 300% year-to-date gain on its stock price. The stock price of Urban Tea, a Chinese bakery and specialty retailer, increased by over 200% year to date after its pivot to bitcoin mining.      Given some of the companies’ current investments in bitcoin mining versus their valuation, these stocks might have been traded at a very expensive price, Liu said.      Being listed on the U.S. stock exchanges also helps these companies expand their mining operations quickly, said Lingxiao Yang, COO of crypto hedge fund Trade Terminal.      However, the largest mining companies, such as f2pool and Poolin, have not gone public yet, which means they can not just issue shares to raise money for expansion.      If miners in China want to expand their operations or maintain cash flow, they would need to sell mined bitcoin through the over-the-counter (OTC) desks or collateralize their bitcoin to take out a fiat loan. Further, there are growing risks for them to do so because China continues to crack down on OTC trading and make financial transactions related to bitcoin in Chinese banks even more difficult.    Price impact    The sustained bitcoin bull run appears to have emboldened these companies to make hefty investments in bitcoin mining.      Loto Interactive, which is majority-owned by 500.com, set up data centers in China's bitcoin mining hub, Sichuan province, in early 2019. The firm now has at least three data centers in Sichuan, which contributed 96.7% of its total revenue in 2019. The data centers combined could generate up to 6.27% of the hash rate on the bitcoin network, which would make it the sixth-largest mining pool in the world.      “500.com has been quietly developing its bitcoin mining businesses for a few years,” Liu said. Now, “the lottery firm seems to be doubling down on bitcoin mining as bitcoin is seeing the biggest bull run in history.”      500.com’s stock price soared in December 2020 after its chief executive announced the firm would focus on bitcoin mining, and saw a few more spikes when the company announced that it would to buy $8.5 million mining machines, purchase more shares of Loto Interactive and acquire the mining pool services of Bitmain spinoff Bitdeer.      One reason the companies are going all in on cryptocurrency is the sustained bull run.      “We are currently around $50,000 per bitcoin, which makes it extremely profitable for the miners,” he said. “Even if the price drops to $30,000, the miners are still going to make money.”      It’s not only bitcoin pushing these stocks up. Historic gains on ether, the native asset to the Ethereum network, which is the second-largest cryptocurrency, is another driving force. The9 plans to invest in ether mining, which has been highly profitable thanks to increasing gas fees and its staking services.    High Risks    A continued rise in bitcoin may push mining companies' stocks higher but a decline could hit many of these firms when they may not be financially sound otherwise. These companies are searching for a strong revenue stream while they are struggling with their non-crypto businesses. For example, 500.com has posted continuous losses since it suspended all of its online lottery ticket sales due to China’s nationwide inspection on the industry in 2015.      The risks know no boundaries. In the U.S. Riot was a biotech company that made diagnostic machines before rebranding as Riot Blockchain in October 2017. Its penny stock doubled in price after the shift.      But what rises can fall. Shares of Riot Blockchain as well as Marathon and Hive fell dramatically when bitcoin's price dropped this week, with the companies losing over $1 billion combined. In the meanwhile, 500.com suffered a 16% decrease.      Riot is a success story, at least for now, but another firm pivoting to blockchain at about the same time as Riot, Long Blockchain Corp, is a cautionary tale for many non-crypto-turn-bitcoin public companies.      Long Island Tea Corp, a lemonade and iced tea company, announced plans to invest in blockchain and crypto amid bitcoin’s 2017 bull run. It changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp.      The move came at a time when the tea company was desperately trying to stay listed on Nasdaq. However, it aborted its plan when the bitcoin price crashed in 2018. The company later faced an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and wound up losing its Nasdaq listing anyway.      The boom in Chinese blockchain-related stocks in late 2019 is another lesson for companies that make opportunistic investments in this emerging technology. Shortly after Chinese President Xi Jinping called the nation to seize the opportunity on blockchain, a slew of companies that were unrelated to blockchain claimed they had launched ambitious blockchain projects. Their stocks soared.      Some of the companies, including one obscure porcelain manufacturer, were accused by Chinese financial regulators of misleading investors by saying they are involved in blockchain whereas no financial disclosures had shown they were. The stocks have steadily dropped to their previous levels since the gold rush in blockchain cooled off in the country.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/26/chinese-companies-that-have-nothing-to-do-with-crypto-are-pivoting-to-mining,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94eaa49cfd506db65ce0368c909f741d0b3ad47b-1000x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

An independent review initiated by U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and led by Ron Kalifa shows the U.K. Treasury has set out a plan to retain what the report called the U.K.'s leadership position in fintech.      The report, titled the “Kalifa Review of U.K. Fintech” states the country has the potential to be the global center for the issuance, clearing, settlement, trading, and exchange of crypto and digital assets.      Kalifa highlights the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) proposal has been developing its propositions and the U.K. needs to “act quickly” to preserve and maintain its position as a hub for fintech firms.    “The U.K. should aim to be at least as broad in ambition as MiCA – but should also consider whether it can develop a bespoke regime that is more innovation-driven. A bespoke regime for crypto assets should adopt a functional and technology-neutral approach, in line with the principles of the current regulatory framework, as well as the concept of ‘same risk, same regulation’, while being tailored to the risks arising from crypto asset-related activities.”Kalifa Review of UK Fintech    There is the need to be “flexible” to deal with future challenges – such as how Decentralized Finance (DeFi) should be regulated, said the report.      The review concludes the U.K. must continue participating in the international financial regulatory group, the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN), and lead the development of policy and regulation in the areas of crypto and digital assets.

Staying compliant with a changing regulatory landscape in crypto was highlighted as a risk to its business by the leading crypto exchange in its S-1 form filed in the run-up before it becomes a publicly traded company. That compliance is particularly burdensome as the company has to compete with unregulated companies in other jurisdictions who seemingly escape enforcement, Coinbase said.      The company went as far as to single out by name Binance, perhaps Coinbase's least-regulated and most formidable competitor.      “We also compete with a number of companies that solely focus on the crypto market and have varying degrees of regulatory adherence, such as Binance,” said Coinbase.      The soon-to-be-listed cryptocurrency exchange pointed out competitors that choose to operate in jurisdictions with less-stringent local rules are “potentially able to more quickly adapt to trends, support a greater number of crypto assets and develop new crypto-based products.”      Due to limited enforcement by U.S. and foreign regulators, Coinbase continued, such companies are able to operate from offshore, while selling crypto exchange services and products to consumers in the U.S. and Europe, ignoring licensing requirements “seemingly without penalty.”      The Coinbase public filing also seemed to allude to the recent scrutiny of Tether, creator of the widely used stablecoin USDT. Coinbase mentioned its own role as a founding member of the Centre Consortium and the principal reseller of USDC, a stablecoin issued by Circle. Coinbase then highlighted that it is “periodically subject to audits and examinations by regulatory authorities,” a measure that will only now also be imposed on Tether and USDT.      Coinbase also cited anti-money laundering (AML) rules being imposed on crypto exchanges by the Financial Action Task Force, namely the so-called “travel rule” that is being skirted by certain firms in far-flung jurisdictions.      “We may face substantial compliance costs to operationalize and comply with the Travel Rule and may be further subject to administrative sanctions for technical violations or customer attrition if the user experience suffers as a result,” Coinbase said.      With regard to the creep of AML rules and user privacy, Coinbase specifically mentioned the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN’s) proposal in December 2020, that would require regulated exchanges to collect personal information from the owners of private self-custodied wallets, and report certain transactions to the federal government.      “There are substantial uncertainties on how these requirements would apply in practice, and we may face substantial compliance costs to operationalize and comply with these rules,” Coinbase said.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDT | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/26/coinbase-calls-out-binance-as-it-bemoans-compliance-burden,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afcf87b833e0993649f24ed7af0cd113ae72868f-2400x1694.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In each of the first two months of 2021, the platform says it has experienced a jump from an average of around 200,000 per month in 2020 to an average of around three million, according to a company blog post.      Google search trends, a metric that looks at search term data by region, reveals overall interest in cryptocurrencies has increased four times as much as compared to the end of last year. Meanwhile, Glassnode, an on-chain market intelligence platform, shows the number of new bitcoin addresses also rose sharply during the same period.      The total yearly sign-ups for cryptocurrency users on the Robinhood platform now stands above six million, data shows.      The new sign-ups have come as the platform faced accusations for deliberately limiting trading on stocks like GameStop (GME) and other securities last month after a group of retail investors on a Reddit forum kicked off a buying frenzy.      The accusations leveled against the platform were based on the belief the brokerage halted buy orders to stem the bleeding from Wall Street hedge funds. The funds at the time were overleveraged on their positions and were required to cover their shorts when the price of GME pumped, costing the big funds billions.      Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev later described the decision over the incident as being based on a technical and operational one and not from outside sources such as those on Wall Street.

42405973,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAer7ws,1614327376,"Bitcoin Drops Below $45K, Eyes Biggest Weekly Price Loss Since March 2020","Bitcoin briefly dropped below $45,000 shortly before press time Friday, with the risk jitters felt on Wall Street the day before reverberating across the globe.      The cryptocurrency fell to $44,279 at 7:40 UTC (2:40 a.m. ET) – the lowest level since Feb. 11 – after it failed to keep gains above $50,000 for the second straight day on Thursday, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The latest bout of weakness may mostly be attributed to rising bond yields and losses in the global stock markets. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to a one-year high of 1.61% on Thursday, taking the year-to-date gain to over 50 basis points and triggering fears of an early unwinding of stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve that pushed stocks, bitcoin and gold lower. These assets have benefitted greatly from the massive monetary stimulus delivered by the Fed over the past 11 months.      The S&P 500 fell by over 2% on Thursday, setting the stage for sharp losses in the Asian and European shares. While Asian stocks took a beating early Friday, the European indices are showing some resilience. Germany's DAX and U.K.'s FTSE are now nursing marginal losses, after they dropped more than 1% at the opening bell. Comments by European Central Bank officials seem to have calmed market nerves for now.      Right before press time, bitcoin regained some ground to trade close to $46,629. However, the cryptocurrency is still down more than 6% on the day and almost 20% for the week. If those losses are held through Sunday's UTC close, the resulting weekly drop would be the biggest since the second week of March 2020 when prices tumbled by 33%.      Bitcoin has suffered only two double-digit weekly losses and just eight weekly declines in the past 11 months. The data shows the bulls have pretty much dominated the price action since the crash of March 2020 and more so since early October. The cryptocurrency had rallied from $10,000 to above $58,000 in the past 4.5 months.      Looking ahead, the relief for both stocks and bitcoin could be short-lived, as the rising copper-gold ratio, a barometer of global growth, indicates that bond yields have plenty room to rise, as noted by Jeroen Blokland, portfolio manager for the Robeco Multi Asset funds.      Also read: Bitcoin Outflows From Coinbase Suggest Institutions Are Buying the Dip      However, deeper declines, if any, could be short-lived, as blockchain data shows large traders are accumulating the cryptocurrency on the dips. The institution-focused Coinbase Pro exchange has registered outflows of 25,000 BTC in the past 24 hours in a sign of persistent demand from U.S.-based institutional investors, according to Ki Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.      Both bitcoin and stock markets had been showing signs of weakness since the beginning of the week.

42405981,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAer80o,1614313236,US Energy Department Floats Solution to Illicit Crypto Mining Malware,"Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) are asking the private sector for help in commercializing a super-powerful cryptojacking detection algorithm that government officials believe can help datacenters overcome crypto-mining malware.      Disclosed but sparsely described in a Feb. 23 contract opportunity, the technology can sniff out illicit mining software, which harness hosts' spare computing power to mine cryptocurrencies with extreme accuracy. This detection software combats the ""increasing threat"" of burrowed cryptojacking malware, an expensive specter DOE said menaces data centers globally.      Indeed, cryptojackers have been caught hijacking data farms, government computers, major banks, medical research supercomputers, and hundreds of websites to mine crypto, netting their developers millions of dollars – often in privacy coins like monero. They cost their developers nothing but can drain electricity and computing resources from unwitting victim hosts.      DOE officials at the Idaho National Laboratory are now keen to head off cryptojackers by offering their detection technology to private sector partners.    Tech specs    Here's how the tech works in (relatively) simple terms: DOE's invention scans legitimate-seeming data processing applications for hidden cryptojackers that otherwise turn entire datacenters into zombie cryptocurrency mining farms. It spots these exploits reliably using a deep learning mechanism that researchers say is far more accurate than up/down vetting known as binary classification.      Here's how it works: ""This invention is a rapid test based on machine translation to verify a binary submitted for execution on a datacenter system is free of cryptocurrency mining malware. It uses the attention mechanism in deep learning to accurately and reliably detect cryptocurrency malware surreptitiously deployed on high performance computing (HPC) systems. This approach is via machine translation rather than binary classification,"" the contract opportunity read.      In August, scientists at DOE's Los Alamos National Laboratory unveiled a neural network they said could detect cryptojackers faster and more reliably than non-AI methods.      Read more: Los Alamos Scientists Develop AI to Fight Cryptojacking      ""This type of software watchdog will soon be crucial to prevent cryptocurrency miners from hacking into high-performance computing facilities and stealing precious computing resources,” government researcher Gopinath Chennupati said at the time.      It was not immediately clear if the technology DOE now hopes to license out is related to the Los Alamos invention. DOE representatives did not immediately respond to CoinDesk queries.      The juicy details underlying DOE's invention rest behind a firewall that only prospective partners can access.

This was one of the conclusions reached by witnesses at a congressional hearing Thursday. During the “Dollars Against Democracy: Domestic Terrorist Financing in the Aftermath of Insurrection” hearing, held by members of the House Financial Services Committee, witnesses called for better online moderation and data gathering, but not new surveillance or domestic terror statutes.      “To effectively disrupt domestic extremist groups, we need to better understand their financing,” said Rep. James Himes (D-Conn.), the chair of the National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy Subcommittee, which hosted the hearing. “Some extremist groups are eschewing the traditional banking sector in favor of cryptocurrency, avoiding our traditional methods of disrupting extremist finance.”      For the most part, cryptocurrencies were treated as just another payment method alongside more traditional payment rails like PayPal and GoFundMe. Lawmakers largely did not single out cryptocurrencies in particular as a criminal tool.      While cryptocurrencies can be used to transfer funds outside the view of financial regulators, fiat on- and offramps allow regulators the ability to monitor these transactions, said Daniel Glaser, global head of jurisdictional services at K2 Integrity and a former assistant secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes at the U.S. Treasury Department.      “If you want to be able to use a cryptocurrency in the real economy to any scale, at some point [the cryptocurrency] does need to be converted into actual fiat currency, into dollars,” he said. “That's the place where the Treasury Department does regulate cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges are regarded as money service businesses, they have full customer due diligence requirements, they have full money laundering requirements, they have reporting requirements.”      Glaser also noted that cryptocurrencies are largely pseudonymous, not anonymous, later telling Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) that cryptocurrencies make it easier for law enforcement agencies to track transactions.      Daniel Rogers, the co-founder and chief technical officer of the Global Disinformation Index, told Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Penn.) that alternative financing platforms are helping contribute to recruitment and radicalization efforts by domestic terror groups.    Read more: State of Crypto: The US Government Keeps Mentioning Terrorism    Still, at no point during the hearing did any of the witnesses call for new statutes to more closely surveil the financial or cryptocurrency sectors. Indeed, Iman Boukadoum, senior manager at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said new statutes run the risk of being abused.      However, Glaser did point to a proposed Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) rule on unhosted wallets as a possible regulation that could be implemented by the Treasury Department to combat potential terrorist financing.      The proposed rule, which would require exchanges to collect counterparty information on transactions to unhosted, or private, wallets as well as add currency transaction report (CTR) requirements for large transactions, has been controversial within the crypto industry.      While the CTR component would simply bring traditional fiat reporting rules to large crypto transactions, the counterparty component could have unintended consequences, including preventing U.S.-based individuals or entities from using smart contracts and decentralized finance tools.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/02/26/crypto-is-spared-scapegoat-treatment-in-us-hearing-on-terror-financing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d5c91324b253be4394362b5b89f2fac2b195bb0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
