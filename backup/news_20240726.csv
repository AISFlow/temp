31593852,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631824,1722036626,Bitcoin ETFs Added To Michigan State Pension Fund With $6.6 Million Allocation,"The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2023 has opened the floodgates for significant institutional investment in the newly approved market. However, US states are also rushing to capitalize on the success of these ETFs by allocating a portion of their pension funds to reap profits and diversify their investments. Wisconsin, Jersey City, Michigan Allocate Millions To Bitcoin ETFs The first state to take the plunge was Wisconsin, which in May 2023 allocated approximately $98.6 million, or 2% of its pension fund, to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. Now, two more states have joined Wisconsin in allocating state pension funds to Bitcoin ETFs. On Thursday, NewsBTC reported that the mayor of Jersey City, Steven Fulop, announced that it is updating its paperwork with the SEC to allow its pension fund to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: VacEck Places $52.4 Million Price Tag On Bitcoin, But How Is This Possible? The latest state to join the Bitcoin ETF investment bandwagon is Michigan; as in an SEC filing on Friday morning, the State of Michigan Retirement System reported owning $6.6 million worth of shares in the ARK Bitcoin ETF managed by Ark Invest, amounting to 110,000 shares as of June 30th. However, Jersey City remains the only one that discloses the percentage of the fund’s investment in the Bitcoin ETF market and which asset manager will be selected to manage the fund’s allocation. Still, this notes the significant traction that the new Bitcoin ETF market has gained over the past seven months among institutions and now these states, adding to the notable inflows and assets under management surpassing the $17 billion milestone, eclipsing tech-based ETFs. BTC Price Rebound Fueled By Spot ETFs The Bitcoin price has steadily recovered over the past two weeks, rebounding from a 6-month low of $53,500 at the beginning of July. However, according to a new report by on-chain and market data analytics firm CryptoQuant, this price recovery has continued to rely on spot Bitcoin ETFs rather than a surge of new investor inflows. The CryptoQuant report examined Bitcoin price movements and new investor holdings over the past 8 years and found that in previous long-term bull cycles, the Bitcoin price peaked when the number of new entrants crossed a certain threshold, indicating a strong “fear of missing out” (FOMO) driving inflows. However, the firm contends that the current Bitcoin bull cycle does not exhibit the same trend of new investor inflows at price tops. Instead, the report noted that the recent spike in new inflows seen in the year’s first quarter appears to be just a temporary wave between longer-term cycle tops. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Drop Signals Upbeat Price Movement, Analyst Says This suggests that Bitcoin’s recent price recovery has been driven more by the inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs rather than a surge of new investors entering the crypto market. While spot ETFs have supported the Bitcoin price, the report indicates that a more sustainable upside will depend on a return of new investor demand. When writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $67,530, up nearly 5% in the 24-hour time frame.

31593328,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631736,1722031226,"Analyst Says XRP Remains Strongest Compared To Bitcoin And Ethereum, Here’s Why","Crypto analyst RLinda has revealed that XRP is showing impressive strength despite the decline in Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price. She explained why XRP suddenly has such a bullish outlook, considering that the crypto token has underperformed since the start of the year. XRP Is The “Strongest” In The Market RLinda mentioned in a post on TradingView that XRP is the strongest in the market. She noted that the crypto token has been holding quite well as traders and investors are again becoming bullish on XRP due to its “improving fundamental backdrop.” She alluded to the long-running legal battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and how Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently stated that he expects the lawsuit to end “very soon.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Headed For $260,000 But This Must Happen First RLinda also mentioned the rumors that the SEC’s closed-door meeting on July 25 was related to a potential settlement with Ripple. As such, these bullish fundamentals have led to rising trading volumes, prices hitting local highs, and increased whale activity. Bitcoinist recently reported that XRP whales accumulated over 140 million XRP tokens this past week. Network activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) has increased significantly, with a notable increase in the number of new addresses on the network and total addresses interacting on the network, both metrics at their highest levels since March. This again highlights the bullish sentiment that investors are beginning to have towards XRP in anticipation of higher prices. These investors expect that the conclusion of the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple could trigger a massive rally for XRP, especially considering that this case is believed to have been a stumbling block to XRP’s growth in the 2021 bull run. XRP is also long overdue for such a rally, seeing how it has consolidated for over six years. As such, an end to the lawsuit could provide the much-needed catalyst to spark such price movement. Interestingly, crypto analysts like JackTheRippler previously predicted that XRP could climb as high as $100 once the case between the SEC and Ripple ends. Key Price Levels To Watch Out For RLinda mentioned that the price range between $0.6378 and $0.5712 is worth paying attention to from a technical perspective. She claimed that XRP’s price may test liquidity below the support before subsequent growth if it fails to break the resistance level at $0.6378. She also highlighted another crucial resistance level at $0.7440. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Rapidly Accumulate ETH Amid Price Decline Meanwhile, according to RLinda, $0.5712 and $0.5100 are crucial support levels that XRP needs to hold above, as a drop below these levels could invalidate its bullish outlook. The analyst again alluded to the lawsuit and asserted that it would give XRP a “second life.” She suggested this could lead to a successful breakout from the $0.6378 price level, which she added will “open a new path” for the crypto token. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.6, up almost 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42417581,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZ9BN,1722031154,Key U.S. Senate Republican Tim Scott Makes Crypto-Fan Debut,"The Senate Banking Committee has so far failed to move crypto legislation, despite this year's progress in the U.S. House, but ranking Republican Tim Scott has now joined those advocating for crypto-friendly regulation.  He and other U.S. lawmakers spoke in support of the industry at the Bitcoin 2024 event in Tennessee, and several speakers specifically favored using bitcoin as a reserve asset for the U.S., including MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor and ARK Invest's Cathie Wood.  The event is preparing for an appearance from candidate and former President Donald Trump, who has recently turned his longtime crypto resistance into strong advocacy.  U.S. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee who may be in position to be its next chairman, argued at a Bitcoin 2024 appearance on Friday that the government should ""make it easy"" for the crypto industry to innovate in the U.S.  It's a common refrain from Republican lawmakers these days, but Scott – the direct counterpart of crypto skeptic Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) – had stayed relatively quiet on crypto as that committee became the bottleneck for U.S. legislation.  He broke that reticence with his lively crypto debut at Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville, Tenn., where he shouted the merits of digital assets. Scott could become chairman of that committee, which oversees U.S. financial regulation, if Republicans retake the Senate majority after the November elections.  ""We have to get rid of the folks who are in the way,"" he said, speaking alongside U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), and lambasting Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler as a crypto-policy roadblock. ""Chairman Gensler, lord have mercy … Hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back, no more, no more, no more.""  Before Friday, Scott, who'd been among those running for the Republican presidential nomination this year, had been relatively quiet on crypto issues, even as Democrats on the committee – such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) – became outspoken critics of the industry. His potential for grabbing the chairman gavel on the Senate Banking panel next year repeatedly came up during his time on stage with Lummis, and he said that if it happened, he'd make sure her legislation gets a prompt vote, ""setting bitcoin free here at home.""  Lummis has reportedly been pushing recently for a bill that would call for the Federal Reserve to hold some bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. She didn't get into the topic during her appearance on Friday, though many at the event hope former President Donald Trump mentions that idea when he's set to appear at the conference on Saturday.  ""The innovations of Bitcoin are now becoming more clear in the U.S. Senate, and it's also becoming more clear who wants to protect the innovation and who wants to regulate it,"" Lummis said.  Legislation to regulate crypto has passed in the House of Representatives but is so far languishing in the Senate. Advocates are still hoping something can get through at the end of the year, but the odds remain slim.  As for new crypto legislation at this stage of the congressional session – with the 2024 election looming and the session speeding toward its end – it's unlikely to find sufficient traction to become law, but such efforts can sometimes begin a negotiation for future bills.  The senators took the stage soon after Michael Saylor, executive chairman of software firm MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, advocated that the U.S. should aim to acquire 4 million BTC to boost its Treasury and build its financial strength. He said only one or two nations will have an opportunity to enjoy what he described as the token's massive future growth to that extent.  ""Bitcoin is not the solution to all our problems,"" Saylor said. ""It is the solution to half our problems.""  Read More: Germany Almost Done Selling Bitcoin, Holding Less Than 5K Tokens After Latest Moves  ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood also praised the notion of a strategic bitcoin reserve for the U.S.  ""If they do it in the right way, meaning this is not an instrument of monetary policy at all, but it simply goes on our balance sheet … this could be transformational,"" she said.  The conference also saw Robert F. Kennedy, the independent presidential candidate who has been a longtime supporter of digital assets, promise to make bitcoin a strategic reserve asset if he's elected president (though polls suggest he remains a long-shot candidate). There had reportedly been last-minute discussions with representatives of Vice President Kamala Harris about attending, but she won't be appearing.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/26/key-us-senate-republican-tim-scott-makes-crypto-fan-debut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b87968d1914ca1c49ec3f46eb6ed6191103999b7-2995x1685.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Following the highly anticipated rebrand, the AI token saw a positive price action, surging over 15% on the last day. Investors and market watchers expressed optimism about the rebranded token and consider it could hit $10 soon. Related Reading: Ethereum Targets Recovery: Can It Mirror Bitcoin’s Performance? From RNDR To RENDER Last year, the Render Network Foundation changed from Ethereum (ETH), where it was initially launched, to Solana (SOL). The move followed a community vote that passed two major upgrades for the Network. According to the announcement, the Solana switch was “proposed for faster transactions, cheaper fees, and the project’s needs to achieve more ambitious goals with more on-chain data and transactions.” The community also voted to rebrand the token from RNDR to RENDER, which would conclude in 2024. This month, the foundation informed users that many crypto exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, OKX, Crypto.com, and KuCoin, would automatically swap the RNDR tokens for the rebranded token on a 1:1 ratio. On Monday, the RNDR delisting from crypto exchanges began ahead of the scheduled migration on July 26. Exchanges halted most operations with the token, negatively impacting its performance over the week. Moreover, Whales seemingly contributed to the impact of the token’s price. Online reports revealed that some major holders sold their RNDR following the news, dragging the price from above the $7 support level to below the $6.5 price range. The token continued to plunge in the following days, dropping below the $6 mark, a 17% drop in four days. Nonetheless, the highly anticipated migration and listing of the new RENDER token seems to have kickstarted a price recovery. AI Token Skyrockets 17% Following Binance Listing The newly rebranded crypto AI token surged over 17% today after being listed by crypto exchange Binance. On Friday, the exchange announced that RENDER had been added to Binance Simple Earn, Buy Crypto, and Binance Convert. Additionally, it revealed that the Binance Margin and Futures options would be available today for the AI token. Meanwhile, the Auto-Invest option will be added on Monday, July 29. On that date, Kraken, the crypto exchange, will also list the RENDER and delist the RNDR. Investors and market watchers expressed their optimism over the rebrand and Binance listing. An X user claimed that, as the project begins this new era, “the RENDER token with this fresh chart of around $6.5 lows has potential to reach unimaginable heights.” Crypto analyst Coinboss considers that the token could “do a flipperino” if it has a clean break out above the $7 resistance level.

Another pseudonym crypto analyst believes RENDER could reach $10 soon, stating, “Thanks for the fud. See you above $10.” Some users also consider that investors will regret not getting the “greatest buying opportunity.” Related Reading: Solana’s Celebrity Tokens Down 94%, MOTHER Community Defends The Memecoin In the last 24 hours, the crypto AI token has seen a remarkable 140% surge in market activity, with $83.1 million daily trading volume.

42417591,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZ9Jd,1722025128,Trump Speaks Saturday at the Bitcoin Conference. Here's What Attendees Like 'The Crypto Patriot' Hope He Says.,"Former President Donald Trump speaks Saturday at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville.  Attendees shared their hopes for the speech with CoinDesk.  NASHVILLE — It's finally here: President Donald Trump Bitcoin Conference Speech Eve. That means Friday is the last weekday you'll exist in a world where a U.S. presidential candidate hasn't given the keynote speech at the Bitcoin Conference.  As his appearance looms, people wonder: What will he talk about?  There is speculation he'll announce plans, or at least hopes, for the U.S. government to hoard a bitcoin strategic reserve. Trump has spoken previously about wanting bitcoin {{BTC}} to be made in America, so perhaps that'll come up again. Maybe he'll diss his likely opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, for declining an invitation to the very conference he's speaking at.  CoinDesk journalists are in Nashville for the event. Here's what attendees on the show floor and speakers on stage had to say.  'A bold statement'  Fred Thiel, CEO of bitcoin miner Marathon Digital, echoed talking points many hope the former president embraces: ""If the U.S. were to have a strategic reserve for bitcoin, they could project power,"" he said on stage. ""The U.S. needs to be the largest holder of bitcoin and the largest miner of bitcoin.""  Others buzzing around the conference floor are excited about what Donald Trump will say tomorrow – or want him to amp them up.  ""I want to hear [Trump] give a bold statement on the future of crypto and spark up what we all want,"" someone who gave his name as Caesar and said he founded the MAGA VP memecoin told CoinDesk during an interview. ""And that's a movement and that's a run. And that's what we're here for and that's what we're here to promote. We are all chasing the dream of that freedom.""  Whether ""movement and run"" is in reference to a bitcoin price spike or more empowerment or wider liberty or further freedom is up to interpretation, though the answer could easily be ""all of the above.""  Help the dollar with bitcoin  And then there was The Crypto Patriot, the pseudonym for a member of the MAGA MEME PAC. That's a group of crypto advocates who are visiting swing states to register voters in an attempt to unify the crypto vote. (Despite the name, MAGA Meme PAC is not an officially registered political action committee.)  ""I hope [Trump] just keeps his same tune,"" The Crypto Patriot said, adding that he’s a fan of the U.S. having a bitcoin reserve. ""Hopefully they're going to back our reserve with bitcoin and that's what I'm hoping, to give the dollar some stability,"" he added. ""The dollar is currently under attack and the rest of the world is catching on to what we're doing. If we can back it with bitcoin and bring back that standard where the dollar can't be inflated, I think that would be a great strategic move to not only grow the entire crypto sphere but also help America prosper.""  Crypto advocate and former political candidate Michelle Bond remarked on the evolution of Trump's crypto stance from hater to fan. ""Look at how he's come full circle. We know what's on the platform already, but I think the message should be: We're going to do everything we can to keep this industry onshore and keep the United States the leader in this space.""  She added: ""I would really like to hear him detail the ways to get there. Also, I think the biggest and best way to do that is through the tone of the talk. You have this positive message and then you say: 'All right, what do I need to do?' and you put in the right financial regulators, you nominate people who are not anti-crypto. One of my ideas for him is to create a crypto czar in the administration and that person be the coordinator among the regulatory agencies and crypto. And he can do executive orders, we have lots of negative executive orders, what about a positive one?""  'Some red meat'  While many are excited about the Trump speech, not everyone has excitable views on the topic. Bittrex Global CEO Oliver Linch, who is British, brings a more laissez-faire view on the Trump speech. ""Will there be any show stoppers, like the bitcoin reserve? Who knows? There'll be some red meat for the crypto enthusiasts, because of course there will be, but I think the fact that he's doing it at all is the story."" Linch added: ""In the U.K., neither major party even mentioned crypto"" in the leadup to that nation's recent election.  And then there are the regular attendees, unattached to any sort of organization – someone like Phil Whatley, a retired software developer from Alabama, who told CoinDesk he hopes Trump clarifies that bitcoin transactions are tax-free. ""If you're trading peer-to-peer, with a truly distributed system, then how're you going to tax them?""  What will happen after Trump's Saturday speech? Will bitcoin pump? Will it dump? Will it do nothing? Who knows, though it's hard to see how Trump, the current favorite to win the election, speaking about the topic does anything but help the crypto market.  Something that might get it there? Copying the bullishness of fellow presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent. At a conference side event called Karate Combat, he said: ""I am a huge supporter of bitcoin. I have most of my wealth in bitcoin. I am fully committed.""

Delivering a keynote address at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Saylor noted that at bitcoin's current price around $65,000, it's got a market cap of $1.3 trillion, or just 0.1% of all global wealth.  For bitcoin to get to his base case of $13 million in 2045, said Saylor, would require an annual rate of return of 29%. At that level, he continued, bitcoin would have a market cap of $280 trillion and account for 7% of global wealth.  In a bull case, Saylor said bitcoin could be worth as much as $49 million and account for 22% of global wealth; his bear case was a value of $3 million and 2% of global wealth.  Under Saylor's leadership, business software company MicroStategy has accumulated a bitcoin stack of 226,331 tokens over the last four years that's currently worth about $15 billion, or roughly 80% more than the cumulative purchase price.

After the hack of July 2023, CRV has never been the same again. However, the painful liquidations of Michael Erogov’s loans have worsened the situation for holders. Curve Founder Forced To Sell $677,000 Of CRV, Token Falling After the forced liquidation in mid-June, which pushed prices below $0.30, data showed that the founder was also forced to sell CRV in the market to repay part of his loan. Yesterday, on July 25, Lookonchain data showed that Erogov was liquidated for $677,000 worth of CRV. Currently, CRV continues to print, discouraging lower lows. Even though the dump has not been as rapid as in June, the token is weak and could plunge below crucial support levels. For now, this level is at the double bottom at $0.21. On the upper end, resistance lies at $0.30. Interestingly, this resistance level served as support in June when prices slammed through the floor, accelerated by Erogov’s loans being liquidated. Then, due to the amount in the picture, there was fear across the crypto board that the founder’s loans would further destabilize the protocol, negatively impacting CRV holders. On-chain data shows that Erogov had borrowed roughly $100 million in stablecoins using $140 million in CRV as collateral. Some claim the founder bought prime real estate with this loan. Related Reading: Solana Set For 900% Rally With Breakout From This Pattern — Analyst However, what’s known is that the series of forced liquidations and the scramble by the founder to offload CRV, which allowed him to be liquidated after the hack, forced prices even lower. Hopes On Spot Ethereum ETFs And Community Initiatives Since the hack on July 30, CRV has cratered by over 50%. Holders are facing it rough now that crypto prices are also sliding, retracing from their March 2024 peaks. Selling pressure has since eased after most of the CRV collateral posted by Erogov was reclaimed by lending protocols—including Frax and Aave. However, the token is still struggling for momentum. This weakness is a concern, especially considering the positive developments this week. As an Ethereum-based DEX, the approval and trading of spot Ethereum ETFs would benefit the protocol in the long run. Beyond the derivative product opening up institutions to Ethereum, Curve is also growing in strength. Recently, the community okayed a proposal to further boost CRV liquidity by bridging the gap between Solana and Ethereum via USDT.

The goal is to encourage cross-chain activity and provide even more incentives for liquidity providers.

31588420,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631730,1722015015,Why Is ETH Price Struggling Despite The Spot Ethereum ETFs Launch?,"Post the Spot Ethereum ETFs launch, the ETH price has continued to struggle unexpectedly, proving that the launch of the Spot ETFs were a ‘sell the news’ event. So far, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has lost around 10% of its value since the Spot Ethereum ETFs trading began on Tuesday, July 23, and could see further decline from here, according to an analysis from Matrixport. Spot Ethereum ETFs Triggers Selling Following the launch of the Spot Ethereum ETFs, there was a lot of excitement in the market, especially around the fact that investors could now gain exposure to ETH without having to directly buy the underlying token. However, this excitement has been short-lived as days after the launch, the ETH price continues to struggle. Related Reading: End Of The Road? Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Sees Massive 80.3% Crash In Active Accounts In a report released on Thursday, Markus Thielen, Head of Research at Matrixport, outlined a number of reasons why the ETH price was declining. As Thielen explains, while the inflows crossed $100 million on the first day, the Grayscale Ethereum fund had been suffering outflows. Just like with the Spot Bitcoin ETFs launch, the Grayscale ETH fund, which holds around $9 billion in ETH, began recording outflows. This is due to the fact that Grayscale’s management fees remain high with competitors offering fees as low as 0.19%. On the first day alone, $481 million flowed out of the fund, and $326 million followed the next day. In addition to this, the Mt. Gox distributions began around the time of the Spot Ethereum ETFs launch, so this even also put extra selling pressure on the crypto market. Just as the Bitcoin price did with the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the ETH price has responded negatively to these outflows, leading to a price decline below $4,200. Will The ETH Price Recover From Here? Outflows from the Grayscale ETH fund since the launch of the Spot Ethereum ETFs have been one of the major factors driving the ETH price decline. However, it is not the only bearish development that has emerged for the cryptocurrency. Thielen points out that the ETH price may have reached the top, using the daily stochastics indicator as a guide. Now, when the value of this indicator is low, it often means a buying opportunity and the price is hitting a low. Meanwhile, the value being high suggests that the ETH price may have hit its top. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Headed For $260,000 But This Must Happen First According to the report, the ETH price had hit a score of 92% in the days leading up to the Spot Ethereum ETFs launch. Usually, a score above 90% is bearish for the price as it means the cryptocurrency is currently in overbought territory. Subsequently, the value of the stochastic indicator is expected to decline as investors offload their holdings. So far, there have been a 5% decline from 92% to 87%, suggesting that there is still a long way to go before the ETH price stops bleeding. “Considering the recent rally and the potential overhang from Mt. Gox, the US earnings season, and the weak seasonals for August and September, it might make sense to press the Ethereum short a bit longer,” Markus Thielen said in closing.

""The development represents a major leap forward for the BitVMX proving system, demonstrating the ability to challenge and validate the execution of a SNARK verifier on-chain,"" Rootstock's team said.  A team of developers from Rootstock Labs and Fairgate say they've succeeded in the technological breakthrough of interactively verifying a SNARK proof – a powerful type of cryptography in many blockchain systems – on the main Bitcoin network.  The demonstration could represent a major advance in making the largest blockchain more accommodating to faster, cheaper layer-2 networks, with programmability similar to what's currently possible on Ethereum and other networks.  The SNARK was verified using a modified version of Robin Linus's BitVM design, known as BitVMX, that the team developed independently. Linus developed BitVM as a computing paradigm designed to allow Ethereum-style smart contracts on Bitcoin.  Zero-knowledge SNARK (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) refers to a process where one can demonstrate knowledge without revealing that information and without the prover and verifier interacting.  The verification took place on Bitcoin's mainnet on Thursday, having been completed in a testnet environment the day before.  ""The development represents a major leap forward for the BitVMX proving system, demonstrating the ability to challenge and validate the execution of a SNARK verifier on-chain,"" Rootstock's team said in an emailed statement on Thursday.

31587108,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631756,1722009645,"Toncoin Under Pressure As TON Price Falls Below 100-Day SMA, $6 Looms","Toncoin (TON) has recently seen a notable price decline, dropping below its 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This breach of a critical technical indicator has placed the digital asset under bearish pressure, raising concerns among investors and traders. With the $6 mark now looming as a potential target, there is market speculation about whether the price will continue to decline or if a possible recovery could occur. This article aims to inform readers about the potential implications of Toncoin’s recent technical breach by providing an in-depth analysis of its market performance, specifically focusing on the price falling below the 100-day SMA. It also assesses possible future scenarios for TON’s price movement, exploring whether the digital asset will continue to decline toward the $6 mark or if a recovery might be imminent. At the time of writing, the price of Toncoin was trading around $6.75, up by 2%, with a market capitalization of over $16 billion and a trading volume exceeding $220 million. Over the last 24 hours, there has been a 2.01% increase in TON’s market capitalization, while its trading volume has decreased by 14.75%. Breaking Below The 100-Day SMA: A Technical Analysis After successfully crossing below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), the price of TON on the 4-hour chart is currently showing a short-term bullish correction, marked by a series of bullish candlesticks. However, it is important to note that the cryptocurrency may eventually decline toward the $6 support level again, as it remains trading below the 100-day SMA. Although the signal line of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator on the 4-hour chart is attempting an upward move, it is still trending below the 50% level. This suggests that the current bullish trend may be short-lived, as momentum could shift from bullish to bearish, potentially driving the price towards the $6 support mark. On the 1-day chart, Toncoin is attempting to retest the 100-day SMA by forming a single bullish candlestick after breaching below it. Following this retest, the cryptocurrency asset may resume its downward movement towards the $6 support mark. Finally, it can be observed that the signal line of the 1-day RSI indicator has crossed below 50% and is currently moving towards the oversold zone. This positioning of the RSI indicator indicates a potential shift in momentum from bullish to bearish for TON’s price. Conclusion: Assessing The Long-Term Outlook For Toncoin Exploring TON’s long-term outlook reveals that if the coin’s momentum shifts from bullish to bearish, the price will begin to move downward toward the $6 support mark. When the price reaches this level and breaks below, it may move lower to test the $4.6 support mark and probably move on to test other lower support marks on the chart if the price breaches this level. However, should Toncoin reach the $6 support range and experience a rebound, it could begin to move upward toward the $7.75 resistance mark. If the price breaks through this resistance, it may continue to rise, testing its all-time high of $8.20 and potentially establishing a new all-time high when this mark is surpassed.

In the event of irregularities at the stablecoin issuer, the bank providing the default guarantee may suffer reputational damage, the regulator said.  Stablecoin issuers operating in Switzerland create a risk for the banks they work with, the country's financial markets regulator, FINMA, wrote in guidance published on Friday.  That's because the issuers, who take deposits from the public and might otherwise be treated as banks themselves, can obviate the need for a banking license by reaching an agreement with a registered lender to repay their customers in case of default.  ""This creates risks for the stablecoin holders and the bank providing the default guarantee,"" FINMA said in the guidance note. ""In the event of irregularities at the stablecoin issuer, the bank providing the default guarantee may suffer reputational damage due to its contractual relationship with the issuer and may also be exposed to legal risks.""  Concern over the backing carried by issuers of stablecoins, which are crypto tokens whose value is tied to another asset such as the U.S. dollar or gold, has proliferated for years. As far back as 2021, Tether, whose USDT is by far the largest stablecoin by market cap, published its first account of reserves to deal with queries about its funding. Circle, whose USDC is the No. 2, followed suit in 2022.  FINMA's guidance, which builds on an initial note from 2019, sets out a number of requirements to ensure adequate protection. Customers must have their own claim against the guarantee-providing bank, and the guarantee must cover the full amount of deposits and interest. In addition, the bank must ensure that the deposits it receives don't surpass the cover provided by the guarantee.  The regulator plans to ensure that the risks associated with default guarantees are addressed in future discussions.",NEGATIVE,USDT | USDC,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT | USDC,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/26/stablecoin-default-guarantees-pose-risks-to-the-issuing-banks-swiss-regulator-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e48a156eed2596a1aee71fd49d62f041a0ae4d50-4454x2506.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Take-up of self-custodial wallets may have been hindered historically by the seemingly unforgiving nature of having to store and remember one's own seed phrase.  Crypto wallet provider Ledger has unveiled its second new product of the year as it seeks to make self custody of cryptocurrency more accessible and convenient.  ""Ledger Flex"", like the more expensive Stax wallet which launched in May, incorporates touchscreen technology to ""redefine the experience of self-custody,"" CEO Pascal Gauthier said in an emailed statement on Friday.  Ledger has also unveiled its new Security Key app, which offers passkey capabilities as an alternative to conventional passwords.  Instead of using a password, the app uses a cryptographic passkey login system where there is essentially a private key stored in the secure element for logging into the service. These are tied to the user's seed phrase that is used to restore access to coins in the event of losing access to one's wallet.  Collapses of high-profile crypto firms in 2022 highlighted the importance of users taking custody of their assets rather than entrusting them to exchanges. However, take-up of self-custodial wallets may have been hindered historically by the seemingly unforgiving nature of having to store and remember one's own seed phrase - a random string of words that are used as a failsafe for restoring access to coins.  Thus, Ledger is attempting to mitigate these concerns by embedding the recovery phrase in security tools that users are accustomed to when logging into mobile devices or websites, such as passkeys.

31584672,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631732,1722004258,"Bitcoin Supply Drop Signals Upbeat Price Movement, Analyst Says","After its latest halving event, Bitcoin sent a positive signal throughout the crypto market. Historically, this big drop in supply has been connected to notable price gains, which has inspired investor hope. Related Reading: Debunking Doubts: How XRP Could Achieve A 3-Digit Surge — Analyst The halving, which cut the rate at which new Bitcoins were made, has actually slowed the flow of new Bitcoins into the market. This sudden drop in supply, along with growing interest from institutions and wider use, is likely to push Bitcoin prices up. Many investors are attentively observing these dynamics and expect a similar trend in the near future; previous halvings have sometimes followed significant price rebounds. Bitcoin: Changing Investor Attitudes The substantial decline in the number of new deposit addresses on cryptocurrency exchanges marks a clear trend in the Bitcoin market. Data from the well-known analysis tool CryptoQuant shows that just 25,000 rather than 70,000 freshly registered Bitcoin deposits exist. This decline in selling pressure denotes a change in investor behavior towards holding rather than trading their Bitcoin. Investors are unwilling to sell #Bitcoin “A decreased willingness to sell assets could lead to a reduction in the supply of Bitcoin on the market, which, with steady or increasing demand, may cause price increases.” – By @AxelAdlerJr Full post 👇https://t.co/HdipPeIh6h pic.twitter.com/jhNDHiSKst — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 23, 2024 According to CryptoQuant analyst AxelAdlerJr, this decline in selling pressure denotes a change in investor behavior towards holding rather than trading their Bitcoin. Such behavior shows that the market is mature. As investors gain more faith in Bitcoin’s long-term value, they trade less. They spend in a more stable way, which might make the market less volatile and more stable. This trend shows that buyers are beginning to see Bitcoin as an asset with value, not just a way to speculate, which is good news for the cryptocurrency. Institutional Confidence And Market Psychology As more and more investment firms are pouring money into Bitcoin, everything has changed. Big investment businesses and institutional investors provide the market legitimacy and security, which can affect how regular individuals think about investing. Big players may inspire trust and long-term thinking among smaller investors. This dynamic is much enhanced by behavioral economics. The activities and confidence levels of additional institutional investors entering the market might affect the sentiment of individual investors. This phenomena can result in a positive feedback whereby rising confidence stimulates more investment. Related Reading: Solana Set For 900% Rally With Breakout From This Pattern — Analyst One important statistic emphasizing this change in investor attitude is the declining deposit addresses. It implies that anticipating better future prices, investors are less ready to sell their Bitcoin. Supported by both lower supply and higher demand from both institutional and individual investors, this line of thinking fits the growing conviction that the price of Bitcoin will keep rising.

Market has responded positively to the Bitcoin treasury strategy. SMLR's quant metrics are strong, and the QuantaFlo product has a moat. There is strong potential for increasing BTC per share and accreting value. Semler Scientific ( SMLR ) first announced its Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) treasury strategy on 28 May 2024 and purchased 581 BTC for $40 million. A few days later, on 6 June, it announced an additional purchase of 247 BTC for an aggregate of $17 million. Altogether, SMLR has 828 BTC, acquired for $57 million. Just a month earlier on 7 May 2024, SMLR had announced on their quarterly report a cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balance of $62.9 million. This means that SMLR has spent about 90% of their cash on BTC purchases. The market has responded very favorably. On 24 May, SMLR closed at $23.32 per share. On 28 May, the day of the initial Bitcoin treasury announcement, SMLR closed at $29 per share. Today, SMLR is about 10% above that point, trading at around $31 to $34 per share. What's particularly curious about this is that SMLR has basically lost money on its BTC purchase for most of the time between 28 May 2024 and today (22 July 2024). 828 BTC acquired for $57 million is an average price of $68,840.5797 per BTC. BTC hasn't been trading over $68,000 for several weeks. The business' balance sheet is literally less valuable because rather than holding onto cash or investing in T-bills, SMLR has incurred an unrealized loss on their cash balance in their BTC position. The adoption of a Bitcoin treasury strategy has many people thinking that SMLR is taking a page out of the MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) playbook. There are obvious parallels, and the question on many people's minds is whether SMLR might be the next MSTR and whether this is a good entry point. Here I analyze the business in light of its new BTC strategy. To answer the question, I don't think this is the next MicroStrategy, but I am bullish on the stock and, in general, any business that is adopting a Bitcoin treasury. Business Here is the description of SMLR on Seeking Alpha: Semler Scientific, Inc. provides technology solutions to enhance the clinical effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare providers in the United States. The company's products include QuantaFlo, a four-minute in-office blood flow test that enables healthcare providers to use blood flow measurements as part of their examinations of a patient's vascular condition. It also offers Insulin Insights, a software program that is used by a healthcare provider to optimize outpatient insulin dosing. The company's products serve cardiologists, internists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, podiatrists, family practitioners, healthcare insurance plans, integrated delivery networks, independent physician groups, and companies contracting with the healthcare industry, such as risk assessment groups and retailers. It offers its products through sales representatives and distributors. The company was incorporated in 2007 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. SMLR's quantitative metrics stand out amongst peers. Here are Seeking Alpha grades on valuation, profitability, and growth. Valuation Grade (Seeking Alpha) Profitability Grades (Seeking Alpha) Growth Grades (Seeking Alpha) Note that SMLR's growth grades are pretty good on a YoY basis, but it lacks grades on a forward basis. This is likely due to the lack of Wall Street analyst coverage: there isn't a forward-looking estimate. The overall growth grade is a D- but that seems to be due to the lack of coverage. The metrics with actual results have warranted B to A- grades. The business has no debt and is paying for operations using its cash flow. The total common equity on the balance sheet has risen from $30 million at the end of 2020 to $78 million in the last report. This is a 160% increase in the book value of equity, on a business that has paid down its debt. Meanwhile, the price to cash flow ratio has been trending down for years, as shown below. SMLR Price to Cash Flow (Seeking Alpha) SMLR frankly seems undervalued here. Its core product, QuantaFlo, is a compact device designed to diagnose peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This noninvasive, painless test takes just a few minutes and operates by measuring blood flow with a sensor clamp attached to the toe or finger. I thought this article was particularly good at getting into the details of the product: Semler Scientific: Great Product Can Still Thrive Post Medicare Advantage I will conclude that revenues from QuantaFlo are mostly safe thanks to its competitive advantage over substitute solutions. It seems to save insurance companies money in doing health evaluations, and it has a patent until 2027, which gives it a decent moat. Let's now talk about the BTC acquisitions. Bitcoin Treasury SMLR has only used its cash reserves to acquire BTC. This is very different from MSTR, which has little cash reserves and is issuing securities to raise money to purchase BTC. MSTR takes on debt, dilutes its shareholders, and even issues convertible debt to purchase BTC. This is an immediately obvious disparity. We can look at a company's Bitcoin treasury with respect to how much of the market cap the BTC occupies. Here we can see a line-up of various companies, and the second column from the right shows the percent of market cap the BTC holdings are responsible for. Bitcoin Treasuries (bitcointreasuries.net) MSTR's BTC represents about 49% of its market cap. Another way to say this is that MSTR trades at roughly 2x its BTC holdings. Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ), one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world, has a BTC treasury that amounts to about a fifth of its market cap. In other words, MARA trades at 5x its BTC holdings. SMLR's BTC represents about 23% of its market cap, so it is trading at a little over 4x its BTC holdings. Can this multiple go higher? I think so. If SMLR levers up the business and buys BTC, then it would be a medical product line with a leveraged BTC fund attached. The cash flows from the medical product can be used to acquire more BTC on a going basis, which increases the BTC per share over time. Leverage is also useful when the duration is long and the interest rate is fixed, because this represents a short position on the currency: you'd effectively pay back the loan with dollars which are worth less than when you took out the loan. Lastly, we can also think of this leverage as increasing the ROE of the business. Something with positive ROE can, assuming a low enough cost of debt capital, grow bigger with leverage while benefiting from interest-based tax deductions. If SMLR issues shares to buy BTC, it can arbitrage the premium of the share price over the BTC holdings and rapidly increase the BTC per share while decreasing the premium. For example, right now, SMLR trades at roughly 4x its BTC holdings, so doubling the shares outstanding would entail issuing what is effectively 2x the value of current BTC holdings, since now, each share would be worth half as much as before, which would allow SMLR to 3x its current BTC treasury (this example is highly illustrative and does not assume things like market impact of purchases of BTC or sale of issued shares; in reality markets will likely try to front-run both events and even volatility). Issuing shares to buy BTC was effectively the MSTR strategy. This has been one factor that has driven down the share premium of MSTR to its BTC holdings: MSTR is only 2x its BTC holdings, while other stocks are 3-5x their BTC holdings. The other factor is that MSTR doesn't have a profitable business model, which means the only way they expand BTC per share is by using the financial engineering of raising fiat via capital markets and then purchasing BTC. Everyone else is basically purchasing using their cash flows (Bitcoin miners are technically purchasing BTC via operating cash flows because they get paid in BTC). Each issuance of new shares to buy BTC will incrementally increase BTC per share, which is extremely value accretive, if BTC succeeds in the long run (and this is the thesis of anyone with a Bitcoin treasury). SMLR can do this too. So far, it has resorted to using excess cash only for its purchases. Here's what Eric Semler, Chairman of SMLR, had to say in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine published two days after the initial PR announcing the Bitcoin treasury: ""I couldn't help but notice what MicroStrategy accomplished,"" Semler Scientific Chairman Eric Semler told Bitcoin Magazine. ""It's amazing what they've done. They have this great story of taking a company that was basically trading at the market value - its cash was its complete value - and just turning that cash into a growth asset through their purchases of Bitcoin,"" he added. ""It was a brilliant move on Michael Saylor's part, and he's obviously proven himself with that strategy."" While Semler clearly admires Saylor's bold move, he stated that Semler Scientific will approach adding bitcoin to his company's treasury in a way that works best for the company, as he stated that Semler Scientific doesn't plan to stray from its core mission - producing high-quality medical software - as it adopts bitcoin as its primary treasury asset. Later in the same article, it says: Well-versed in capital markets as well as in investing in small- and mid-cap (SMID-cap) businesses - companies like Semler Scientific itself, which has a market cap of about $227 million - Semler knows that SMID-cap companies need to do something if they want to stand out to investors. ""It takes a lot for a SMID-cap company to get the attention of investors,"" explained Semler. It seems that they are doing something to stand out, and the market has definitely noticed and rewarded the stock with significant appreciation. SMLR has always operated quite conservatively. They had no dividend even though they had plenty of cash, and they took no outstanding debt even though it could have boosted ROE. I find it interesting that a week after the initial PR, they filed an S-3 Form to issue $150 million in debt and $50 million in common stock, with the express purpose of buying BTC: S-3 Form (SEC) I think they'll continue to use a portion of free cash flow to buy BTC. Since their business is more diversified from Bitcoin than Bitcoin mining, I expect the market to eventually expand the 4x multiple. SMLR also holds an embedded option to use leverage or issue shares to buy BTC, which would be enormously accretive on a BTC per-share basis, because its premium to underlying BTC is so high. Risks The risks to a BTC strategy is volatility in the share price. BTC is very volatile and if your equity has a leveraged BTC fund attached, then that volatility will leak into the equity. This takes a different kind of investor to hold the stock. If you think BTC is a dubious asset class, then this strategy is of course terrible news. The other risk of SMLR is on the business side. A decline in the demand for QuantaFlo will ultimately disrupt the strong revenue growth that SMLR is used to. Failure to create new products or open new sales funnels of the existing product will also cause stagnation in the company. These risks are very real and could be a reason for the stock trading at just 12x earnings. For what it's worth, SMLR could probably transition to a BTC holdings and acquisition entity, much like what MSTR has become. It would not have the same kind of scale and access to capital because it is still a small-cap company (and this makes it not the next MSTR). But this would be the worst-case scenario where QuantaFlo is disrupted as a viable revenue stream and SMLR cannot find new ways to generate meaningful revenue. The Bottom Line I think SMLR is an interesting business to watch because of its recent Bitcoin treasury decision. I think we'll see more of this in the future from other companies, and early adopters of Bitcoin treasuries are sure to benefit as more companies begin to do the same. I rate this a Buy. I'm expecting the 4x BTC holdings multiple to expand as the company aggressively buys more BTC using its cash flows.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4707092-semler-scientific-smlr-stock-bitcoin-next-microstrategy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/31583089.jpeg

This forecast, which seems almost inconceivably high compared to most market predictions, has garnered significant attention. Despite the ambitious forecast, VanEck’s research team has presented a comprehensive rationale explaining why they believe such a substantial price increase is attainable. VanEck Predicts Bitcoin Valuation For 2050 On July 24, VanEck published a report, outlining the teams’ assumptions for a bull scenario in which BTC could potentially rise to $52.38 million by 2050. Notably, the research team predicted Bitcoin’s future price based on three scenarios during a Base, Bear and Bull market. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Rapidly Accumulate ETH Amid Price Decline For the base scenario, VanEck’s team believes that Bitcoin could potentially surge as high as $2.9 million by 2050. The analysts have rooted their predictions on the possibility that Bitcoin could be utilized to settle 10% of the globe’s international trade and 5% of the world’s domestic trade. Under this scenario, central banks may hold about 2.5% of their assets in Bitcoin, further increasing its adoption and exposure. VanEck’s team has also attributed their projected surge in BTC’s value to assumptions of anticipated global growth, rising investor demand and Bitcoin’s substantial transaction volume. The research team estimated Bitcoin’s value for 2050 using a simple velocity of money equation that includes three key factors – GDP of trade settled in Bitcoin, supply of circulating Bitcoin and Velocity of Bitcoin in the market. While predicting a bull surge to $52.38 million, VanEck’s analysts assumed that by 2050, Bitcoin will play a crucial role in the international monetary system, capturing significant market share from major currencies. Additionally, they expect Bitcoin to become widely adopted for international trade, transforming into a major medium of exchange and a key store of value. Moreover, VanEck believes that BTC could act as a reserve currency for different countries. The team has noted that Bitcoin was designed to replace fiat money and could become a reliable and efficient alternative to current monetary systems, which feature “corruptible human authorities with immutable logic.” VanEck’s Bearish Scenario For BTC While the VanEck team estimated an exceptionally ambitious price target for Bitcoin in 2050, they also presented a more bearish scenario for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Under less favourable conditions, analysts suggest that Bitcoin could hit a price level of $130,314 by 2050. Related Reading: Cardano In The Spotlight: Why The $0.6 Level Is Important To ADA A target of $130,314 over the next 25 years, could be the most bearish scenario for Bitcoin’s value. This contrasts sharply with predictions from analysts at financial firms like Standard Chartered and Bernstein, who forecast that Bitcoin could surge as high as $150,000 by the end of 2024 and $200,000 by 2025, respectively. Despite VanEck’s pessimistic assumption, at press time, Bitcoin’s price is trading at $67,101, reflecting a 4.24% increase in the last 24 hours and another 4.78% spike over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap.

The report also said the threat level was elevated since the Israel-Palestine conflict escalated.  Singapore's government noted an increasing use of cryptocurrencies in terror financing, even though cash and other informal value transfer systems remain the predominant means for financial transactions.  A report by the Ministry of Home Affairs assessed the threat to Singapore from terrorists and determined that while there was no indication of an imminent attack, the threat to the city-state remained ""very real"" and ""high.""  It pointed to monthly funds sent in crypto by ISIS to individuals at the Al-Hol detention camp in Northern Syria, where ISIS-affiliated and displaced individuals are placed. The report also highlighted how pro-ISIS groups in Southeast Asia shared a poster ""soliciting cryptocurrency donations.""  ""As a global financial centre and transport hub with a significant migrant workforce, Singapore remains a potential source of funds for terrorists and terrorist organisations abroad,"" the report said. ""Our strongest defence is our collective vigilance.""  The report also said the threat level was elevated since the Israel-Palestine conflict re-escalated.  In the months after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, a Wall Street Journal report claimed Palestinian groups received substantial funds in crypto.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose about 5% in the past 24 hours, regaining $67,000 during the Asian morning. BTC has outperformed the wider digital asset market, which has added around 4%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20). Attention will likely turn to Nashville for cues on the next move for world's largest cryptocurrency, as the BTC 2024 conference gets underway. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called himself ""a huge supporter of bitcoin,"" and said he had most of his wealth in BTC, in a conference speech on Thursday. Republican candidate Donald Trump is set to speak on Saturday.  Ether continues to underperform the wider crypto market following $152 million of outflows from ETH exchange-traded funds. Current cumulative flow for the ETFs since they started trading this week is negative $178.68 million. That's mainly owing to withdrawals from Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which converted to an ETF. ""This situation is very similar to the bitcoin ETF product launched at the beginning of the year,"" CoinShares analysts said in an emailed note. Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which converted from a closed-end structure into an ETF that allowed redemptions for the first time in 10 years, weighed on bitcoin's price over the first weeks. Ether has risen by around 2% in the last 24 hours, sitting at $3,240 at the time of writing.  The municipal pension plan of Jersey City, New Jersey, will soon invest in bitcoin via ETFs, according to a Thursday social media post from Mayor Steven Fulop. The move follows a Wisconsin pension making a similar decision earlier this year. The investment is expected to be completed ""by the end of the summer,"" according to Fulop's post on X. Though Fulop did not specify exactly how much of the pension funds' assets will be allocated to bitcoin ETFs, he said it would be “similar” to the 2% allocation made by Wisconsin’s state pension fund. Fulop did not specify which bitcoin ETF Jersey City was considering for the investment.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the daily net inflow of BTC into wallets tied to centralized exchanges.  On Wednesday, centralized exchanges recorded a cumulative net inflow of nearly 50,000 BTC, of which 42,000 coins were deposited in wallets tied to Kraken.  Most of the inflow likely stemmed from Mt. Gox moving coins to exchanges as part of reimbursing creditors.

Nine spot ether ETFs from eight different issuers were approved. Like their spot bitcoin counterparts, most of these products have fee waivers for either the first six to 12 months or a certain amount of assets (anywhere from $500 million to $10 billion). It took a high-profile lawsuit and several years for spot bitcoin ETFs to finally be approved. It was well worth the wait. Over six months later, those ETFs continue to gather interest as more investors understand the complementary nature of crypto and ETFs. On July 23, spot ether ETFs started trading and have carried on the momentum from earlier this year. Here is a look at the first day of trading and what the future could hold for spot ether ETFs. What happened on July 23 Nine spot ether ETFs from eight different issuers were approved: the iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ) , the Fidelity Ethereum Fund ( FETH ) , the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF ( CETH ) , the Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ) , the VanEck Ethereum ETF ( ETHV ) , the Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ) , the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF ( QETH ) , the conversion of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) , and its spinoff the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ( ETH ) . Like their spot bitcoin counterparts, most of these products have fee waivers for either the first six to 12 months or a certain amount of assets (anywhere from $500 million to $10 billion). The post-waiver fee of spot ether ETFs matches the fee of each issuer’s spot bitcoin ETF. Excluding Grayscale, these fees range from 0.19% to 0.25%. ETHE has a fee of 2.5% while its spinoff, ETH has the lowest fee of the group, at 0.15%. These fees are relatively low. That’s especially so when considering that many spot crypto ETFs in other regions have fees in the 1%-2.5% range. It seems issuers are sacrificing margins to stay competitive and potentially become a trusted name in the crypto ETF world. Big first day for spot ether ETFs with over $1B in trading volume After the first trading day, these nine ETFs had over $1 billion in trading volume. (As of the time this note was written, there is not any flow data available … but there likely will be by the time you read this). But if we assume most of the volume in ETHE (Grayscale’s original Ethereum trust) is outflows and the rest of the ETFs have mostly inflows, there would be between $100M to $200M net inflows. To compare, spot bitcoin ETFs traded over $4.5 billion in volume on their first day in January. So first day-spot ether ETF volume is between one-fourth to one-fifth of spot bitcoin volume. This isn’t unexpected. Bitcoin is much more popular than ether, with 54% market dominance versus 17% (according to CoinMarketCap). For many investors, bitcoin has become almost synonymous with crypto and can easily be thought of as digital gold. Ether has arguably more use cases than bitcoin for blockchain technology and digital innovation (see previous research note here ). But the story can be harder to sell and requires more education. More interest ahead if they follow in the footsteps of spot bitcoin Spot bitcoin ETFs have been the most successful ETF launch ever. Yet demand for spot ether ETFs doesn’t have to be record-breaking for it to be impactful. Just over six months later, these ETFs continue to gather assets. And I expect spot ether ETFs to gather more assets over the long term, especially as more investors begin to understand its use case. I think there won’t be too many surprises versus spot bitcoin ETFs. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ) have dominated their peers. I expect iShares’ ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH will likely remain on top as well. Many of these issuers are native crypto players and have been deeply involved in the industry. But we cannot underestimate what brand names mean to traditional retail investors. That’s particularly so because a large issuer can sometimes make investing in a higher-risk asset like ether seem more acceptable. While the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) was the third-most in-demand spot bitcoin ETF, I was surprised to see 21Shares CETH at the bottom of the spot ether list. It seems ARK pulling out of the product affected its popularity. Though 21Shares is a huge player in the crypto universe with a good reputation of its own (more on this later). Lastly, Grayscale has more of chance to dominate this time around. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) has experienced over $18.7B in net outflows YTD mostly due to its high fee (1.5% vs. 0.20%-0.25% for its peers). But Grayscale spun off ETH from ETHE and will spin off the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) from GBTC on July 31. Both of these spinoffs will only have a 0.15% fee and will have a higher amount of assets to start. That will make these an attractive option for investors. ETH, for instance, launched with the most assets besides ETHE. When BTC launches, it will have the sixth-highest amount of assets relative to its peers (after GBTC, IBIT, FBTC, ARKB, and BITB). Two types of spot crypto ETF is a lot different than one Approval of one type of spot crypto ETF (e.g., bitcoin) can be considered an exception. Two kinds of spot crypto ETFs (e.g., bitcoin and now ether) is not necessarily a rule — but it is close. Some issuers are already eyeing Solana ETFs (see previous coverage here ). So it isn’t unreasonable to assume this ecosystem will continue to grow as it does in other countries. In a recent note, I published a chart that included all issuers involved in the U.S. cryptomarket. I’ve simplified that to just include spot products (including tentative filings). The list becomes more narrow, with only a few overlapping: bitcoin, ether, and Solana. This list is not exclusive, however. And many issuers may be waiting for the spot ether launch to end before focusing on other types of crypto ETFs, like Solana. I think it’s very likely some of these issuers will attempt to create a suite of crypto ETFs (if allowed by the SEC). 21Shares and VanEck, for example, have crypto suites in other geographical areas like Europe. VanEck offers 12 crypto exchange traded products in Europe. And 21Shares has an even broader offering. Grayscale also offers its line of trusts in the U.S. (GBTC and ETHE were previously part of this line-up) including a Solana trust and Litecoin trust. I would not be surprised if these eventually get converted to ETFs (once again, if it is allowed by the SEC). There are a few roadblocks with the SEC — like security versus commodity classification. Then there’s also the question of demand and whether ETF investors are focusing on additional digital assets beyond bitcoin and ether. Solana has only 3.5% market dominance compared to 71% for bitcoin and ether combined. These figures tend to align with product demand. For instance, the VanEck bitcoin ETN in Europe has $457 million in net assets, followed by $165 million in net assets for its ethereum ETN, and only $77 million in net assets for its Solana ETN. Bottom Line The crypto ETF market has come a long way, and barring any legal roadblocks, may continue to thrive with potentially more products past bitcoin and ether spot ETFs. The spot ether ETF launch has proven that investors do have interest in cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin. And with more education and resources, we can expect that interest to grow rather than fade away.

31577553,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631738,1721993458,Wall Street Expert Sees 20x Potential In Ripple Via XRP And IPO,"In a recent presentation, Linda P. Jones, a former Wall Street financial expert and author of the bestseller “3 Steps to Quantum Wealth: The Wealth Heiress’ Guide to Financial Freedom by Investing in Cryptocurrencies,” detailed her bullish outlook for Ripple, leveraging a valuation comparison with Coinbase and the potential of XRP. Why Ripple Could Be Massively Undervalued Jones began by noting Ripple’s present valuation on the Linqto investment platform at $7.5 billion—a stark contrast to its 2020 and 2022 valuations of $10 billion and $15 billion respectively. These figures were determined during Ripple’s Series C buyback phases. She underscored this point by stating, “That’s amazing to me that it’s such a low valuation. That’s good for us as investors. Right?” Related Reading: XRP Skyrockets 40% As Speculation Of Ripple-SEC Settlement Gains Momentum The financial expert utilized the initial public offering (IPO) of Coinbase as a benchmark for Ripple’s potential market entry. She highlighted that when Coinbase went public in 2021, at the peak of the cryptocurrency market’s surge, it was valued at $86 billion. Given this comparison, Jones argued that if Ripple were to IPO with a similar market reception, it would yield an eleven-fold return based on its current valuation. Adding a layer to her valuation model, Jones discussed the significant holdings of XRP by Ripple. Ripple currently has 48 billion XRP in escrow, valued at approximately $29 billion at the current market rate of $0.61 per XRP. Jones pointed out, “Now, Ripple does not put it on their books. They don’t value it. They don’t give XRP any value. But they do sell XRP, and they do make money from selling XRP.” She proposed that future changes in accounting standards might allow cryptocurrencies like XRP to be included on balance sheets, which would further enhance Ripple’s valuation: “Joe [Endoso, CEO of Linqto], and I believe that the accounting standards will change and will allow a company that has a cryptocurrency to be able to have it on their balance sheet in the future.” With Ripple’s potential IPO valuation combined with the current market value of XRP, Jones estimated a total valuation of $115 billion, indicating a possible 15 times return on investment from current levels. Furthermore, if XRP were to return to its all-time high of $3.59, seen in 2017, she suggested that Ripple’s total valuation could reach $150 billion, equating to a 20-fold increase from its current valuation on Linqto. Jones referenced historical price movements of XRP from 2017, where it saw a dramatic increase of 60,000% in just 248 days. “We’re repeating that pattern right now. We’re at the tip of the wedge,” she elaborated, suggesting a possible repeat of these dynamics. Highlighting the strategic silence on customer agreements and other news, Jones hinted at significant undisclosed partnerships with major corporations such as Amazon and Apple, which could further bolster Ripple’s standing if confirmed. “That’s without the settlement with the SEC. That’s without having crypto laws. That’s without having an IPO announced. That’s without having an ETF. That’s without having any disclosure about customer agreements that Ripple has because they’ve had to be very quiet about that. We happen to believe they have agreements with Amazon and Apple,” Jones said. Related Reading: Pro-XRP Lawyer Debunks Ripple-SEC Settlement Rumor For Tomorrow She concluded her presentation by emphasizing the promising value for investors who are currently in or considering entering Ripple or XRP. “So we have all kinds of blue sky ahead in terms of possibilities for XRP and for Ripple. So I just want to point out what a great value it is for those of us who have already invested. But it’s still available on the [Linqto] platform as of today,” she concluded.

The so-called descending trendline proved a tough nut to crack on Monday – as well as when it last came into focus in May – becoming a level to beat for the bulls.  That might happen soon, if the mood among analysts is a guide.  One trigger could be the U.S. core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC (08:30 ET). Another is Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's impending speech at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville.  ""Incoming PCE data could be the final nail in the coffin for high interest rates and lead to imminent rate cut announcements, while Trump’s speech at the Bitcoin conference could start a stronger rally if rumours of an announcement of a national strategic reserve for BTC come true,"" Valentin Fournier, an analyst at digital assets analyst at advisory firm BRN, said in an email.  These factors could bring bitcoin to new highs, Fournier added.  The PCE reading is forecast to show a 0.1% rise in June, following virtually no change in May and gains of 0.3% in the preceding three months, according to FactSet. The annualized figure is forecast to print at 2.4% for June, the smallest increase since 2021.  The continued progress toward the Fed's 2% target strengthens the case for interest-rate cuts by the central bank. Renewed liquidity easing against the backdrop of resilient economic growth highlighted by Thursday's US. GDP data could galvanize bids for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Crypto investors are also anticipating Trump's scheduled speech on Saturday. Speculation has swirled all week that he might announce a bigger role for BTC in the financial system.  Other factors like the mining hashrate, which measures the amount of computing power dedicated to the network, and increasing stablecoin supply also flash bullish signals, according to crypto services provider Matrixport.  ""The Bitcoin mining hashrate, a leading indicator for bitcoin rallies, has improved. Instead of inventory slashing, Bitcoin inventories continue to increase. The inventory build-up suggests confidence in future price increases despite some miners shutting down unprofitable machines,"" Matrixport said in a note to clients Friday.  Matrixport also noted that fiat-to-crypto inflows have picked up, as indicated by the recent increase in the market capitalization of the stablecoin sector.  ""Historically, such increases have been bullish, signaling a shift of funds from traditional financial markets into the crypto sector,"" it said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/26/bitcoin-analysts-express-optimism-as-price-nears-resistance-level-that-stymied-it-in-may,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abb3ebd0ecd0a0ef48407889616c9609a769d5bd-2710x1274.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31572627,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631701,1721986200,Solana Set For 900% Rally With Breakout From This Pattern — Analyst,"Recent events have brought Solana (SOL) to the spotlight, drawing in both experts and investors due to its notable price gain. According to market expert Ali Martinez, the price of Solana is likely to see a remarkable growth of 900%, which will ultimately result in the price reaching $1,630. Related Reading: Ethereum Name Service (ENS) 153% Rally ‘Underway’, Analyst Says Based on his prognosis, Solana might be about to perform better in the coming weeks or months. This is because it has recently displayed a pattern called a “bull pennant”, which in technical lingo usually means the price is set for a big ascent. The next period of stabilization, during which volatility dropped and price action became more narrow, led to the pennant shape. Martinez says that Solana’s recent break above the top trendline of this pennant is a strong sign that prices will go up. This big step forward and last week’s 20% rise show that the market’s mood has changed a lot. #Solana $SOL has officially broken out from this bull pennant, suggesting a potential 900% rally ahead. pic.twitter.com/CWQdWGny0X — Ali (@ali_charts) July 24, 2024 Market Situation Shows Mixed Signs Notwithstanding the hopeful estimate, the state of the current market shows a mixed picture. Currently selling at $166, Solana shows a 9.70% drop only this week. Meanwhile, Fisher Transform, which predicts market turning moments, shows a bearish signal for Solana. This implies that although the break from the pennant is positive, instantaneous market circumstances could not entirely support the predicted upward trajectory. Observing that the TD Sequential indicator flashed a Sell signal on three separate timesframes for Solana, Martinez had earlier expected this retreat. He says that although the 868% increase to $1,630 is still a long-term possibility, it is not likely to happen right away. Solana: Forecast Creates A Complex Picture Unlike Martinez’s very optimistic view, current Coincheckup data offers Solana a more cautious estimate. Solana is selling 14% below its projected value right now, according the statistics for the next month. With a forecast 4.37% increase over the next three months, the short-term view is still cautiously positive nonetheless. This little rise implies that the crypto is likely to hold steady even if quick rebound might be sluggish.

42417576,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTZ97F,1721985086,"BTC Outperforms Broader Crypto Market, Ether Price Drop Mirrors Bitcoin ETF Launch","BTC outperformed the wider crypto market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index during the Friday Asia trading session.  One analyst said the performance of ether exchange-traded funds mirrors that of the bitcoin ETFs after their launch in January.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} outperformed the broader crypto market during the Asia trading day, adding 4.4% to test $67,000 while the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) rose 3.3%.  Solana’s SOL jumped over 5% to lead gains among major tokens, CoinGecko data shows, with ether {{ETH}}, BNB Chain’s BNB and Cardano’s ADA adding 3%. Dogecoin {{DOGE}} rose 4%, while Solana-based memecoin popcat (POPCAT) jumped more than 8% to lead gains in that category.  For the third day, ether products led liquidations across crypto futures, with over $70 million in longs liquidated compared with $55 million on BTC-tracked futures.  Open interest – or the number of unsettled futures bets – dropped by $1 billion over the past 24 hours, indicative of money leaving the market.  Bitcoin Outflows  According to data from SoSoValue, bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added a net $31.16 million, bringing the cumulative net flow since their introduction in January to just under $17.5 billion. Total net assets of the ETFs amount to $59.14 billion, or about 4.6% of the entire market cap of the largest cryptocurrency.  Ether, the second-largest, rose 2.8% to top $3,200, according to CoinDesk Indices data. The ether ETFs experienced a net daily outflow of $152 million, SoSoValue data shows. Current cumulative flow for the ETFs since they started trading this week is negative $178.68 million. That's mainly owing to withdrawals from Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which converted to an ETF.  ""This situation is very similar to the bitcoin ETF product launches at the beginning of the year,"" CoinShares analysts said in an emailed note.  Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world's largest bitcoin fund at the time, which converted from a closed-end structure into an ETF that allowed redemptions for the first time in 10 years, weighed on bitcoin's price over the first weeks. Later, inflows to rival funds overcame the negative trend, propelling BTC to an all-time high in March.  The Grayscale Ethereum Trust is following the same path but faster, making the decline a ""prime buying opportunity,"" said Mads Eberhardt, a crypto analyst at Steno Research.  ""If this trend continues, the outflow from the Grayscale Ethereum ETF could end much quicker than it did for bitcoin in January, perhaps as early as mid-next week,"" Eberhardt said. ""After this, we estimate we will see strong net inflow, due to the inflow into the other ETFs as observed over the last few days.""  Rachel Lin, CEO and co-founder of SynFutures, disagreed, saying she expects short-term pain for ETH traders.  “As we saw with Bitcoin, Grayscale's ETH ETF fund is becoming a net seller on the market with over $810 million in outflow since the ETF launch,” Lin said in an email to CoinDesk.  “Grayscale currently holds over $8 billion worth of Ether, and nearly 10% of it was sold in just the past two days. If the trend continues, Grayscale might reach the 50% mark far sooner than with Bitcoin. However, that would also mean more downside for Ethereum.""  Aave outperforms  Looking away from BTC and ETH, AAVE, the native token of the Aave decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol is up 15% as the market reacted to a token buyback proposal.  The proposal, which is currently in a ""temp check"" phase, where feedback is solicited, would contribute more protocol revenue to buying back AAVE tokens from the secondary market and redistributing them to stakers.",NEUTRAL,AAVE | BTC | ETH,AAVE | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Sam Reynolds, Shaurya Malwa, Krisztian Sandor",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/26/btc-outperforms-broader-crypto-market-ether-price-drop-mirrors-bitcoin-etf-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec130a12054e51999c5f3793071604a033fa5afc-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Republican presidential nominee will deliver a keynote address at the Bitcoin 2024 convention on Saturday, a three-day event that's touted as the world's largest BTC conference. Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance have been courting votes and donations with the promise of lighter crypto regulation, as opposed to the Biden administration's crackdown that has upset the industry. Trump is the first major presidential candidate to accept crypto donations. He raised over $4M through crypto donations, a campaign aide told CNBC . The donations have been in the form of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), ether ( ETH-USD ), Ripple's XRP ( XRP-USD ), stablecoin USDC ( USDC-USD ) and various memecoins. Notable crypto advocates who donated include the Winklevoss twins; Mike Belshe, CEO of digital asset security firm BitGo; Jesse Powell, founder of crypto exchange Kraken; and Ripple's legal chief Stuart Alderoty. Crypto sentiment has been improving this month, especially after the assassination attempt on Trump that raised his odds of winning the election and drove the so-called 'Trump Trade.' Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was trading around 5% higher Friday morning. A Trump presidency would be great for bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as his administration would likely adopt more favorable policies, according to Jon de Wet, CIO at digital asset firm ZeroCap.

Kennedy Jr. doubled down on his support for bitcoin during the BTC 2024 conference  Crypto and its role in the economy has become a hot-button issue in the election.  Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. doubled down on his support for bitcoin at the BTC 2024 conference in Nashville.  ""I am a huge supporter of Bitcoin. I have most of my wealth in Bitcoin,"" he said. I am fully committed.""  Bitcoin has become a hot-button issue in this electoral cycle with Republican nominee Donald Trump's campaign announcing it would accept crypto donations in May. Many crypto entrepreneurs have come out to support the Trump campaign, with Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell donating $1 million in crypto to Trump and the Winklevoss Twins donating to a Trump-aligned PAC.  Kennedy, a libertarian-leaning candidate, took aim at the Federal Reserve, saying the central bank had the interest of bankers, not the general public, at heart.  “The relationship between Congress and the Fed is both parasitical to our country, and it’s a symbiotic relationship. The Fed is not a public institution … The decision-makers are appointed by the banking industry,"" he said during a conference panel hosted by TheStreet.  Kennedy also argued that Covid lockdowns were vastly in favor of billionaires and not ""Main Street.""  ""Lockdowns … shut down all the small business in this country, which is what we should be nurturing, and kept open the Walmarts, and the Amazons, and Facebook, and the oil industry, and the processed food industries, and Big Ag. They all flourished during that period,"" he said.  Earlier this year Kennedy spoke at CoinDesk's Consensus conference in Austin, Texas where he said crypto is key to ""transactional freedom.""  ""We need sovereignty over our own wallets, transactional freedom and a currency that is transparent. We need to make sure America remains the hub of blockchain technology,"" he said during Consensus.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/07/26/us-presidential-candidate-rfk-jr-says-hes-fully-committed-to-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb84f0972b6a89a2efb45ef55da17547bd74b4ae-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

31569105,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631682,1721980851,US To Buy $619 Billion In Bitcoin If Kennedy Jr. Is Elected,"During the industry day of the annual Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Robert Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate for the US presidency, unveiled an ambitious financial policy plan that could transform the United States into the world’s largest holder of Bitcoin. The policy centers on the strategic acquisition of Bitcoin, valued at $619 billion, to match the current US gold reserves. This move, according to Kennedy Jr., is aimed at redefining monetary policy and enhancing fiscal discipline within the federal government. Kennedy Jr. Vs. Donald Trump During a roundtable discussion with Scott Melker and Caitlyn Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, Kennedy Jr. emphasized the philosophical alignment between his policies and the Bitcoin community’s ideals of personal freedom, property rights, and governmental integrity. “This is more than about increasing the size of your pile,” Kennedy Jr. said, underlining Bitcoin’s potential to enhance self-sovereignty and counteract what he describes as a “destructive war economy” driven by fiat currency. “Bitcoin is not only an offramp to this inflationary highway which is the highway to hell, but it also is a way of restoring integrity to our government. It’s a way of restoring personal freedoms, it’s a way the middle class can isolate itself from inflation which is just a form of government theft,” the independent candidate stated. Related Reading: In The Works: Jersey City Mayor’s Plan To Introduce Bitcoin ETFs Into Pension Funds Kennedy Jr. drew a contrast between his consistent advocacy for Bitcoin and the recent supportive gestures from former President Donald Trump, who will speak at the conference on Saturday. Kennedy pointed out Trump’s prior skepticism and his recent controversial decision to potentially appoint JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon as Treasury Secretary, which Kennedy criticized as contrary to the ethos of draining the political “swamp.” He added, “President Trump also was connected with Steve Mnuchin who tried to end person-to-person Bitcoin transactions,” emphasizing the need for a cautious approach towards Trump’s newfound enthusiasm for Bitcoin. Moreover, Kennedy Jr. detailed his plan to incrementally integrate Bitcoin into the US treasury. Starting with the issuance of treasury bills anchored to a basket of hard currencies—including platinum and gold—Kennedy proposed a phased approach that would begin with 1% of new treasury issuances backed by these hard assets, scaling up to 100% over time. US Would Need To Buy $619 Billion In Bitcoin “I would be willing to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet. I’m going to do that. I’m gonna actually do a basket of hard currencies of maybe platinum and gold and other hard currencies and begin issuing at least the class of treasury bills that are anchored to hard currency. Let’s say the first year by 1% and then maybe the next year by 2% to watch how that goes because that will inject discipline into the product and ultimately get up to 100%,” Kennedy Jr. explained. Related Reading: VanEck Predicts Bitcoin Price Could Hit $52.38 Million, Here’s When Notably, his strategy would involve direct purchases of Bitcoin to achieve holdings equivalent to the US gold reserves. “I would like to have the federal government begin to buy Bitcoin and over the term my term of office ultimately have an equivalent amount of Bitcoin that we have gold. Because Bitcoin is an honest currency, it’s a currency that’s based upon proof of work,” he declared. According to data by Arkham, the US government currently holds 213,239 BTC worth $14.3 billion confiscated through law enforcement. That means, even if Kennedy would transfer all of these into a strategic reserve, the US would need to buy much more BTC at current prices. The US currently holds the largest official gold reserves in the world, with 8,134 tons of gold valued at approximately $619 billion. To match this value with Bitcoin at current prices would require purchasing about 9.4 million BTC. This acquisition would represent nearly 45% of the total 21 million BTC that will ever be mined. For perspective, MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, owns 226,331 BTC, and BlackRock, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF manager, controls 334,000 BTC.

The Solana-based tokens registered massive gains but became pump-and-dump scams in most cases. Nearly two months later, most of these tokens’ prices decreased significantly from their all-time high days. However, the MOTHER community, one of the best-performing celebrity memecoins, defended their crypto champion against the criticism. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Launch About To Kickstart The Altseason? Analysts Weigh In The Rise Of Solana-Based Celebrity Memecoins In late May, Olympian and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner launched her Solana-based JENNER token. The news surprised the crypto community, which initially suspected the gold medalist had been hacked. Jenner was later joined by rapper Rich The Kid and his RICH token. Both memecoins were received with suspicion by the community and were immediately investigated. Users quickly pointed out that the orchestrator behind the memecoins was a “crypto influencer” named Sahil Arora. Arora was known to be an alleged serial scammer who had previously launched several tokens, including influencer memecoins. Per the reports, these tokens resulted in a pump-and-dump scam that left most investors empty-handed. Jenner initially confirmed working with the alleged scammer but eventually cut all associations. After Jenner, several other celebrities launched tokens with Arora’s help, including Lil Pump, Davido, Trippie Red, and MoneyBagg Yo. Australian rapper Iggy Azalea was also linked to Arora’s scam during the launch of her Mother Iggy (MOTHER) token. Despite the allegations, Azalea assured her followers that she joined the crypto community and launched MOTHER to prevent Arora’s attempts to use her likeness to scam people. Since then, the industry has seen many more celebrity token launches, some linked to Arora and some being alleged hacks. The list includes the likes of Metallica, Andrew Tate, Hulk Hogan, 50 Cent, and more. Many celebrity tokens launched in the last two months registered massive price increases. JENNER saw a 51,000% surge to its ATH, while MOTHER increased by 5,552%. The Fall Of Celebrity Tokens Online reports revealed that the 30 Solana celebrity memecoins launched since May dropped by an average of 94%. According to Web3 strategist Slorg, even the best-performing celebrity tokens “are down more than 70%” from their ATH prices. Andrew Tate-inspired DADDY crowns itself as the smallest loser among the tokens, with a 73.2% decrease. Meanwhile, JENNER and MOTHER follow closely with a 75% and 78.7% drop. Just a month into their lifespan, “exactly half are down over 99%, with 7 others being down more than 90%.” Additionally, 22 of the 30 tokens have a market capitalization under the $1 million mark, and only 4 have a market cap above $10 million. While most of the tokens have been abandoned, some celebrities still endorse their tokens, occasionally posting about them. But with “only 40% tweeting about the token at least once in the last week, most have followed the same trajectory of an initial pump, and then nothing.” Some community members called the celebrity meta “pure exploitation, engagement farming their fan base.” However, the MOTHER community defended the token after the report. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of A POPCAT Correction Following 230% Surge An X user stated that “Iggy should be included in this group” as she seems to be “working her ass off, hasn’t sold a single token, spends hours communicating with holders.” Another user considers MOTHER’s launch “an example of what we would hope for from a celebrity.” They asserted that the token “would be a great blueprint to follow.” As of this writing, MOTHER has seen a 23.1% drop in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.059. Its current price, however, represents a 103.6% increase in the weekly timeframe.

31562620,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=631619,1721970031,"Bitcoin Crashes To $64,000: Will This Historical Support Hold?","On-chain data shows Bitcoin is retesting a historically significant support level after the latest plunge in the asset’s price has gone through. Bitcoin Is Currently Retesting The Short-Term Holder Realized Price As explained by CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn in a new post on X, BTC has returned to the Realized Price of the short-term holders with its drawdown. The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the acquisition price or cost basis of the average investor in the Bitcoin sector. When the value of this metric is greater than the cryptocurrency’s spot price, the holders are in a state of net unrealized loss right now. On the other hand, being below the asset’s value implies dominance of profits in the market. Related Reading: Cardano Among Alts Likely To See Price Boosts, Santiment Says In the context of the current discussion, the Realized Price of the entire market isn’t of interest, but that of only a segment of it: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs include all investors who bought their BTC within the past 155 days. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price specifically for the STHs over the past month: The above graph shows that the Bitcoin spot price has declined towards the STH Realized Price in its latest drawdown. This would mean that the break-even point of the STHs is now being retested. Historically, this retest has proven to be quite important for the cryptocurrency. The line has served as a transition boundary between bearish and bullish periods. Generally, when the asset is in the region above the STH Realized Price, retests of the indicator lead to it reversing back up. Similarly, the line acts as resistance when the coin is under it. The explanation behind this curious pattern may lie in investor psychology. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETF Hype: ETH Whale Activity 64% More Than BTC The STHs are the fickle-minded hands of the market, who easily react to movements in the asset. As such, they are naturally sensitive to retests of their cost basis and may make moves when they happen. When the atmosphere in the sector is bullish, the STHs usually look at their cost basis as a buying opportunity. This is why the level acts as support during bullish periods. In times of bearish sentiment, these investors may panic sell at their break-even instead, thus providing resistance to the asset. The Bitcoin spot price had managed to break through this resistance earlier in the month, but with the plunge, it’s now retesting it again. It remains to be seen if support holds here, confirming the prevalence of a bullish mentality, or a dip under it happens, thus suggesting a transition to a bearish market.

The price is now trading near $175 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $170 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

There was a drop below the $170 level. Finally, it tested the $165 support. A low is formed at $165.12 and the price is again rising. There was a break above the $170 and $172 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $182.51 swing high to the $165.12 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $170 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading near the $175 level. It seems to be struggling near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $182.51 swing high to the $165.12 low. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $175 level. The next major resistance is near the $182.50 level. A successful close above the $182.50 resistance could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $192. Any more gains might send the price toward the $200 level. Are Dips Limited in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $182.50 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $172 level. The first major support is near the $170 level. A break below the $170 level might send the price toward $165.

Jersey City To Join Wisconsin In Bitcoin ETFs Investment According to Jersey Mayor Steven Fulop, the city’s pension fund is currently updating its paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow allocations to Bitcoin ETFs, mirroring a similar move by the Wisconsin Pension Fund earlier this year. Related Reading: Cardano Down 50% In 4 Months: Sellers Unrelenting, Best Time To Buy ADA? However, the percentage of the fund’s allocation to Bitcoin ETFs remains undisclosed, pending final approval from the SEC, but is expected to be completed by the end of the summer. The issuer selected by the city’s fund to manage its investment was also not disclosed in Fulop’s announcement on Thursday. The Jersey City mayor also took to social media to comment on BTC and the crypto industry stating: Not my normal subject matter in a post but I’ll share anyway – the question on whether Crypto/Bitcoin is here to stay is largely over + crypto/Bitcoin won. Mayor Fulop, a self-described long-time believer in crypto, noted that beyond just cryptocurrencies, he believes blockchain technology is “amongst the most important new technology innovations since the internet.” As our sister site Bitcoinist reported back in May, the Wisconsin State Investment Board allocated about $98.6 million, or 2% of its fund, to one of the most successful Bitcoin ETFs and asset managers, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Crypto ETF Frenzy Intensifies Following the recent approval of Ethereum ETFs by the SEC on Monday, asset managers are reportedly quickly ramping up efforts to launch a range of new crypto-based investment products. According to a Bloomberg report, industry giants like ProShares have already filed paperwork for six funds that would provide long and short exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, issuers like Hashdex are looking to package the two largest cryptocurrencies into a single investment vehicle. Related Reading: Debunking Doubts: How XRP Could Achieve A 3-Digit Surge — Analyst The rush of new product filings comes on the heels of the successful debuts of the first Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US in January and Tuesday, respectively, as they have collectively attracted more than $17.5 billion in net inflows so far in 2024, dwarfing the flows of some major tech-focused ETFs. Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said: The successful launches of the first crypto ETFs this year took many analysts by surprise, as the funds attracted significantly more assets than expected. This is clearly emboldening issuers to get even more creative in their efforts to capitalize on surging investor demand. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has tumbled over the past few hours and retreated to the $64,990 level, representing a 2.3% drop compared to Wednesday’s trading price.

The next key resistance could be $0.6320. A clear move above the $0.6320 resistance might send the price toward the $0.6450 resistance. The next major resistance is near the $0.6550 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.680 resistance. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.6120 resistance zone, it could start another decline.

This move could have a significant impact on the entire cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin Contributions Support Trump and Vance’s Platform According to a CNBC report, Trump has raised over $4 million in campaign contributions from a variety of digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Circle’s USDC stablecoin, and various memecoins, ahead of his highly anticipated appearance at the conference. Per the report, the contributions were made through the “Trump 47” joint fundraising committee, which raised over $118 million between April 1 and June 30. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Rapidly Accumulate ETH Amid Price Decline The report also indicates that at least 19 donors contributed more than $2.15 million in Bitcoin to the committee, with contributions from 12 states, including some considered “key battleground regions.” CNBC found that donors’ occupations ranged from housewives to US military officers, missionaries, painters, sales representatives, and State Department security technicians. Crypto figures like the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, founders of the US-based crypto exchange Gemini, each contributed over $1 million in Bitcoin. At the same time, Mike Belshe, the CEO of digital asset security company BitGo, donated $50,000 in the cryptocurrency. These contributions reflect the growing support for Trump within the crypto industry, which represents a significant shift from his previous stance during his time in the White House. Support Behind Trump’s 2024 Bid Trump’s pivot towards a pro-crypto stance has been gradual. Still, it has gained momentum in recent months with moves such as launching his non-fungible token (NFT) collection on the Solana blockchain in April, which has since made increasingly bullish comments on cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the former president’s appearance at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, where he will also host a campaign fundraiser, is viewed as a strategic move to solidify his position as the pro-crypto candidate for the 2024 presidential election. The report noted that the event’s tickets range from $60,000 per person for a photo with Trump to $844,600 per person for a seat at a roundtable with the former president. Related Reading: Debunking Doubts: How XRP Could Achieve A 3-Digit Surge — Analyst The former president’s support for self-custody of cryptocurrencies, his vow to defend the rights of those who choose to do so, and his pledge to keep Senator Elizabeth Warren and “her goons” away from Bitcoin holders have further endeared him to the crypto community. Trump’s decision to name Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate has also been viewed as a win for the crypto sector. Vance has advocated for looser regulation of cryptocurrencies and disclosed his holdings of Bitcoin.

However, he also emphasized that this bullish surge to new all-time highs is contingent on Bitcoin meeting specific market conditions. Bitcoin Set For Massive Rally To $263,000 In an X (formerly Twitter) post on July 23, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Trader Tardigrade’ revealed that Bitcoin’s current price chart was forming a key technical pattern known as the “Cup with Handle chart pattern.” Notably, the Cup with Handle pattern is a unique technical indicator where the price movement of a cryptocurrency typically resembles a cup, followed by a downward price trend which emulates a handle. This handle often signifies a buying opportunity to go long on the asset. Related Reading: Polygon Network Active Addresses Just Hit A New Yearly High, But Why Is MATIC Price Down? Sharing a price chart illustrating Bitcoin’s Cup with Handle pattern, Trader Tardigrade noted that Bitcoin could witness a substantial rally to a measured target of $263,000 before the end of 2024. The analyst disclosed that for this bullish surge to happen, Bitcoin’s price will have to break above the $68,000 level, which represents the handle part of the Cup with Handle chart pattern. In a more recent X post, the crypto analyst revealed that Bitcoin’s price has reached the upper resistance of the descending channel pattern. This pattern signifies when the price of a cryptocurrency is moving within two parallel trend lines and sloping downwards. Typically, the upper trend line in this pattern acts like a resistance and the lower line acts as a support. The analyst further noted that Bitcoin’s price has successfully reached the upper resistance of the descending channel. However, he disclosed that the resistance was weaker than the lower support, making it easier for the cryptocurrency to potentially breakthrough. Trader Tardigrade also predicts that Bitcoin could undergo a brief period of consolidation before witnessing its next breakout move. The analyst declared that the market was currently in the middle of a bull run, with Bitcoin set to surge even higher until late 2025. Key Support Level Identified For Bitcoin’s Next ATH Bitcoin’s price is currently trading at $64,239, marking a slight decrease of 3.11% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite the cryptocurrency’s struggles to reach new highs, Ali Martinez, a prominent crypto analyst, remains bullish on its future outlook. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Shiba Inu Price Will Rise 119% In 5 Days Sharing a price chart depicting Bitcoin’s UTXO realized price distribution (URPD), Martinez predicted that BTC is poised to surge to new all time highs soon.

He added that if Bitcoin succeeds in holding a price level at $66,000, it would set a strong foundation for a potential rally to new levels.

This significant purchase, detailed in a recent company statement, has increased Marathon’s Bitcoin holdings to over $1 billion at current prices, showing the company’s confidence in the future price appreciation of the largest cryptocurrency on the market. Is Bitcoin The ‘World’s Best Treasury Reserve Asset’? According to the company’s announcement on Thursday, by adopting a “HODL” strategy, Marathon has committed to retaining all Bitcoin mined through its operations, coupled with periodic strategic purchases on the open market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Set For 1,700% Rally, Echoing Past Cycle Trends: Crypto Analyst Fred Thiel, the Chairman and CEO of Marathon Digital, expressed notable confidence in Bitcoin’s prospects in the wake of this latest acquisition as a long-term store of value. Thiel noted: We believe Bitcoin is the world’s best treasury reserve asset and support the idea of sovereign wealth funds holding it. We encourage governments and corporations to all hold bitcoin as a reserve asset. The announcement also included statements from Salman Khan, Marathon’s Chief Financial Officer, who highlighted the company’s renewed focus on growing its Bitcoin holdings and highlighted the favorable market conditions driven by increased institutional support and a positive macroeconomic environment: …We are once again implementing this strategy and focusing on growing the amount we hold on our balance sheet. Bitcoin’s recent price decline, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet, afforded us an opportunity to add to our holdings. We look forward to continuing to leverage our technological expertise to support Bitcoin and distributed digital asset ecosystems. Marathon Digital’s Stock Soars In the wake of this announcement, Marathon Digital has experienced a notable surge in its stock performance, with a 42.6% increase over the past six months, outpacing industry averages. According to recent reports, this upward trend in stock value can be attributed to Marathon’s mining efficiency and strategic expansion into mining another cryptocurrency called Kaspa (KAS), a diversification initiative aimed at bolstering the company’s revenue streams. Marathon believes its strategic diversification into Kaspa mining will further increase its revenues and profitability by leveraging the high margins associated with this digital asset. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Soar To $100,000 With Trump Back In The White House? Furthermore, despite BTC mining challenges stemming from the Bitcoin Halving, Marathon outperformed its peers by mining 590 BTC at a “commendable daily rate.” At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has fallen back to the $64,700 mark, down over 2% in the 24-hour time frame, after failing to break above the $68,000 zone following BTC’s recovery from a six-month low of $53,500 on July 5.
