42386230,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSBbh,1616625411,Goldman Files to Offer Notes Linked to an ARK ETF That May Have Bitcoin Exposure,"Goldman Sachs dipped another toe into the cryptocurrency pool by filing to offer notes linked to the performance of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that may have exposure to cryptos such as bitcoin.    In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Goldman said it plans on offering $15.7 million of the ""autocallable contingent coupon ETF-linked notes due 2026.""  Payout on the notes would be dependent on the performance of the ARK Innovation ETF, an actively managed fund offered by Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management.  The ARK Innovation ETF's strategy involves exposure to companies that are capitalizing on disruptive innovation and developing technologies, including blockchain.  The ETF may also have exposure to cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, indirectly through an investment in a grantor trust, according to the filing.  The filing continues a trend by Goldman of offering structured notes with payouts tied to the performance of other instruments or funds with possible bitcoin exposure and that trend seems to be accelerating. A keyword search of such filings yielded 81 results from 2021, with no results showing up for prior years. Of the 81 results from 2021, 15 were from January, 28 were from February and 38 were from March.  The filing comes weeks after Goldman President and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron reportedly said the investment banking giant has been seeing more demand for bitcoin among its clients, and that while the bank was ""regulated"" on what it could do Goldman continues to ""engage"" with clients.  It also comes after the bank recently relaunched its cryptocurrency trading desk with the intention of supporting futures trading for bitcoin, three years after shelving plans to do so.  Meanwhile, the multinational investment bank has issued a request for information to explore digital asset custody, as CoinDesk previously reported.

42386239,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSBoH,1616621063,Crypto Exchange Coinsquare Ordered to Hand Thousands of Customers' Records to Canadian Tax Agency,"Canada’s tax authority, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), has prevailed in a court battle for access to a trove of high-value customer data held by cryptocurrency exchange Coinsquare. And the CRA seems to be coming for more.      Under a federal judge’s March 19 order, Coinsquare must hand over detailed information on its Canadian customers, their crypto trading activity and identifying information to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).      Coinsquare told CoinDesk it will disclose information on an estimated 5% to 10% of its 400,000 customers to the CRA, which had originally sought to secure the lot. Court documents indicate only high-value accounts will be caught in the sweep.      The first of its kind ruling hands CRA a win just seven months after it began pursuing Coinsquare’s customer data in court. CRA argued it needed the data to check if taxpayers were meeting their crypto reporting burdens and the federal court agreed.      Today, CoinDesk also learned the tax authority is ""currently in the process of serving"" Coinsquare with a further request for customer information by means of an ""Unnamed Persons Requirement"" (UPR). According to a spokeswoman for the CRA, the agency needs Coinsquare's customer information to verify compliance with Canada's Income Tax Act (ITA) and Excise Tax Act (ETA).      Coinsquare will have 15 days to comply with the order once it is received.    Echoes of Coinbase vs. the IRS    Five years ago, the Internal Revenue Service, CRA’s U.S. counterpart, launched a similar effort against Coinbase, using a parallel argument for access. Though Coinbase at first lambasted the IRS’ “fishing expedition” it ultimately acceded to a judge’s order, handing over records on some 13,000 customers.      At the time, Coinbase called the outcome a “partial victory” because it said it had pared down the scope of the IRS’ demands to include only accounts trading more than C$20,000 (US$15,800).      Coinsquare echoed that sentiment on Tuesday as it touted the pared-down order secured through negotiations with CRA as a win.      Coinsquare’s final bargain will compel the crypto exchange to hand over at year’s end exhaustive data on accounts that held C$20,000 in crypto from 2014-2020 or cumulatively in their history, as well as the 16,500 largest accounts from each year.      “Coinsquare negotiated to protect its clients’ privacy, and limit any disclosure to only what was absolutely required by the CRA under Canadian tax law,” Coinsquare told CoinDesk.      “Instead of providing the CRA with all client data dating back to 2013 as was initially requested, Coinsquare and the CRA have agreed that information relating to 90%-95% of Coinsquare’s clients will not be disclosed.”      The CRA spokeswoman said the agency ""reserves the right"" to mount future taxpayer data collection efforts against Coinsquare and ""other sources."" However, she said the pared-down court order ""appears sufficient to verify compliance with the ITA and/or the ETA.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/24/crypto-exchange-coinsquare-ordered-to-hand-thousands-of-customers-records-to-canadian-tax-agency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e0975c3b51cf3a9deb7f092582f2e766acf3883-1200x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But Fed Chair Jerome Powell believes when a digital dollar is developed it must provide users with more privacy than the People’s Bank of China's (PBOC) planned digital yuan.      “The lack of privacy in the Chinese system is just not something we could do here,” Powell said while testifying before the House Committee on Financial Services on Tuesday. “We’re only beginning to think carefully about these things and it's going to be a careful, detailed and probably lengthy process of consideration.”      Powell’s comments came after Changchun Mu, the head of PBOC’s digital currency arm, was reported as claiming the digital yuan will offer greater privacy protection than any other digital payment system.      Read more: People’s Bank of China Official Says Fully Anonymous Digital Yuan ‘Not Feasible’      The Chinese official said the digital yuan will have “controllable anonymity,” in which the most private account would only require a cell phone number. However, people need to register with a phone service carrier with their ID to have a phone number. Users would also have to disclose more personal information if their deposit amount hits a certain threshold.      The Fed has not specified how much anonymity any digital dollar would allow users to have, in part because there is no concrete timetable for a digital dollar. While there will be detailed research on the proposed stablecoin coming out as early as July, Fed officials have yet to disclose whether the central bank would host customer accounts or enlist a trusted third party, and what privacy protections users would have in case of a breach.

42386241,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSBuZ,1616617538,Market Wrap: 'Elon Candle' Effect Fades Quickly as Bitcoin Retreats Below $55K,"Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $54,771.18 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.63% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $53,577.33-$57,225.30 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades below its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.    The “Elon Candle” effect on bitcoin appears to be short-lived.      The market jumped early Wednesday after Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced the electric vehicle maker plans to now accept bitcoin as a payment option, and that it won’t convert any receipts of the cryptocurrency back into U.S. dollars.      On the U.S.-based Coinbase exchange, bitcoin’s price briefly shot above $57,000, compared with the prior day’s $54,400. The reaction recalled the action on Feb. 8 when prices jumped more than $7,000 – the most ever for a single day – after Musk tweeted that Tesla had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Traders and T-shirt marketers nicknamed the episode “Elon’s Candle,” after the corresponding vertical shape created on a daily price chart.      Read More: Bitcoin Rises Despite Dollar Strength as Elon Musk Adds BTC Payment Option      But this time around, the market couldn’t hold onto the gains. At press time, the oldest cryptocurrency was changing hands at $54,599.71, down 0.50% in the past 24 hours.      “Bitcoin received a small bullish bump” from Tesla’s latest news, said Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin. “However, bitcoin is still in consolidation mode as traders are still digesting these levels.”      In traditional markets, the dollar index (DXY) rallied to four-month highs Tuesday, and yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note dipped slightly to 1.62%, down from last week’s one-year high above 1.7%.      The bitcoin market, meanwhile, is in a “wait-and-see” mode, Lau said.      Such hesitation is also apparent in the bitcoin derivatives market, where the open interest on futures contracts has remained relatively stable since it reached an all-time high on March 13.    Ether drops again, Ethereum community looks to speed Eth 2.0 transition    Ether (ETH) was down on Wednesday, trading around $1,637.26 and slipping 4.38% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization has declined for the fifth straight day, to the lowest point in two weeks. It briefly spiked with bitcoin after Musks’ tweet, to as high as $1,740.58. However, as with bitcoin, the gains dissipated quickly, according to CoinDesk 20.      Ether “has stalled below final resistance from February, a minor hurdle to new all-time highs, after showing signs of exhaustion,” Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      The Ethereum developer community has recently began spitballing possible dates for speeding up the blockchain network’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, as CoinDesk’s Valid Points newsletter reported earlier Wednesday.

President Brad Smith criticized financial technology firms attempting to issue currencies, saying governments are best suited to play this role, according to a Bloomberg report.    Speaking at a Bank for International Settlements conference on Wednesday, Smith said he is not a big fan of encouraging Microsoft to participate in the issuance of a digital currency, the report said.  “The money supply almost uniquely needs to be managed by an entity that is responsible to the public and thinks really only about the public interest, and that means governments,” said Smith.  One such private firm trying to issue its own digital currency is social media giant Facebook, which is seeking to launch the stablecoin diem (originally called libra).  The prospect caused policymakers and regulators from around the globe to express their concerns over potential privacy and money-laundering risks, as well as the possible loss of control over the monetary system.  “I think the world has been better served by what has been a movement over centuries to put that [digital currency] in the hands of governments.

In 2020, premier league soccer club FC Barcelona made $1.3 million in sales after launching its fan token $BAR.

42434034,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7MXh,1616610379,"Crypto Is Not Regulated in Turkey, and It’s Thriving","When news broke that Turkey’s President Recep Erdoğan had suddenly replaced the head of the nation’s central bank on March 19, Tilbe Yardım, 30, rushed to convert her Turkish lira into crypto.      “Turkish investors and people who understand finance are really angry and saddened about what happened on Friday night,” Yardım told CoinDesk.      The abrupt firing marked the third replacement of a central bank chief by Erdoğan since mid-2019, and signaled currency and institutional instability to investors. Erdoğan, who favors unorthodox monetary policies like slashing interest rates to curb inflation, allegedly fired the central bank head after he raised interest rates. Following Erdogan’s surprise move the lira, Turkey’s local currency, plunged 15% against the U.S. dollar on Monday, although it has recovered slightly since then.      Central bank instability tends to attract people to cryptocurrency. As the lira dropped on Monday, internet searches about cryptocurrencies spiked in Turkey, while searches for precious metal gold (Turkey’s go-to safe-haven asset) remained flat. In Turkey, where the crypto space is not regulated, its young tech-savvy population can buy and trade digital assets freely. Crypto exchanges do not need licenses to operate and there are currently no specific tax laws that apply to crypto.      But the uptick in crypto searches on Monday is the continuation of a much larger story. Turkish interest in crypto has been growing steadily for years, according to Ismail Hakki Polat, lecturer at the Kadir Has University in Istanbul, Turkey, where he teaches a course on cryptocurrency and blockchain.      Read more: Bitcoin Searches Spike in Turkey as Central Bank Chief Fired, Lira Plummets      “From the very beginning of bitcoin, Turkish people have been eager for and interested in cryptocurrencies so it's not a new thing like in Venezuela or Argentina,” Polat told CoinDesk, referring to countries that have more recently seen a dramatic growth in crypto use as a hedge against inflation.      In fact, local media reported that in the beginning of 2021, moving in tandem with the bitcoin price run, the two largest crypto exchanges in the country, Paribu and BtcTurk, were trading over $1 billion worth of crypto daily. By 3:12 p.m. local time on Wednesday, 11 popular crypto exchanges in the country recorded a combined 24-hour trading volume of more than $6 billion.    Global pandemics and bitcoin bull runs    Yardım discovered cryptocurrencies after her family business was put on hold when the COVID-19 pandemic hit last year.      Her family’s factory – which produced and supplied baby clothing to their stores around the world – was shuttered for three months, and Yardım began looking for alternative ways to generate income. She felt that leaving her savings in the bank was “one of the worst things” to do because the Turkish lira had been depreciating against the dollar for some time now.      “I decided to invest my money at least against inflation,” Yardım said.      Yardım has since invested her savings in bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Although Yardım now uses Binance, she first invested in crypto via BtcTurk. In Turkey, interested investors can buy crypto on traditional crypto exchanges or by simply walking into a physical store at Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar.      A 2020 crypto research report published by Turkey’s Information Technologies and Communications Authority (ICTA) estimated there were around 2.4 million crypto users in the country, about 3% of its total population. Polat feels this number might be much higher, especially after the 2020 bitcoin price run.      For instance, the average daily registrations of Turkish users on the British cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO since March 14 is 783% higher than the first half of March and February, according to Konstantin Anissimov, its executive director.      Read more: Why Money Scarcity Means Someone Goes Hungry      Due to the availability of traditional exchanges in the country, peer-to-peer crypto trading platforms like LocalBitcoins are not as popular. But even LocalBitcoins is seeing considerable growth in Turkey this year. Between 2019 and 2020, new user registrations on the platform only went up by 10%, while in February 2021, new registrations and website traffic were three times higher than the average month in 2020, according to data shared with CoinDesk.    Regulation    One reason for the seemingly undeterred growth of Turkey’s crypto market is the absence of regulation. The government is, at least for now, staying out of the crypto space.      “I think the regulations will eventually come, but not right now,” Polat said, adding that crypto is not the central bank’s top priority for the moment because the institution is dealing with an economic and currency crisis.      On the one hand, regulations will be beneficial for the long-term acceptance of digital assets, and they will help dispel the common perspective that crypto is only used on the “dark web” for illegal transactions, Yardım explained.      “On the other hand, government interaction would mean high taxes in Turkey. This is many crypto investors’ concern at the moment,” Yardım said.    Future and freedom    In 2018, Polat co-created an introductory course on cryptocurrency at Kadir Has University in Istanbul. Although he limited attendance to 30 students at the start, Polat says requests to join the class started increasing after large institutions including MicroStrategy and Tesla invested in bitcoin during the price run. Responding to the interest, he decided to open the class to students from other departments in the university and integrated a program that gave 30 more students from any profession the opportunity to take the course.      Around 200 people have completed the course since its launch, Polat said.      “Especially youngsters are very eager to experience and learn about cryptocurrencies … I mean, youngsters generally don't prefer gold or don't understand gold, but then they discovered 'digital gold,'” Polat said.      Read more: MMT, Crypto and the New Nature of Money      Of course, some young Turks may just be looking at crypto as an escape from the country’s economic crisis.      “Let’s say if crypto was not profitable, would anyone invest? Would Americans invest? Would [Turks] invest? Of course not,” Yardım said.      Turkish youths are open-minded and are fond of new technologies and trends, Yardım explained, adding that her 17-year-old cousin is not only investing in crypto but also mining.      “Crypto means basically two things to the young people in Turkey: future and freedom,” Yardım said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/24/crypto-is-not-regulated-in-turkey-and-its-thriving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b5e1d15d4341bb651cc30cafd304c45db21bf27-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434073,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7Mdh,1616607147,New Taproot Activation Timeline Means the Upgrade Is (Probably) Coming to Bitcoin This Fall,"Bitcoin’s developers and community members seem to have finally settled on a timeline to activate Taproot, Bitcoin’s biggest upgrade since SegWit in 2017.      Per notes from a public Internet Relay Chat (IRC) meeting, the code for Taproot could be ready for users to active in the Bitcoin Core client via “Speedy Trial” in May of this year. If Speedy Trial is successful, this would mean the upgrade could be online in November.      “There is broad agreement that we should target something like a May 1st release, with [a 1 week signalling start time afterwards],” Bitcoin Core contributor Jeremy Rubin wrote in meeting notes. If successful, this would mean an “activation time of around Nov 15th,” he notes.      Speedy Trial allots a three-month trial period to see if miners representing at least 90% of Bitcoin’s hashrate will signal their support for the upgrade. If this threshold is reached, then Speedy Trial is successful and the upgrade will be ""locked in."" After this, Taproot’s rules would be officially enforced in another three months.      (If, for example, signaling were to begin on May 7 and miners showed sufficient support, then Taproot would be locked in on Aug. 7 and go live on Nov. 15. The later the signaling begins, the later the activation.) New code in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 8 (BIP8) will set the parameters for the Taproot activation, which will judge when to lock in the upgrade based on block height.    Read more: Taproot Update: Bitcoin Users Home In on Activation Plan, Date Still TBD    As stakeholders appear to be in agreement on the timeline, bitcoiners finally have a (more or less) concrete deadline for when they can expect Taproot’s code to be available to the public to download, marking an end to what has become a painstaking road to a relatively simple upgrade.    Taproot activation’s and the long road to consensus    There is still the caveat that May 7 may not be the exact start date of Taproot’s activation, but it will likely be somewhere around that time.      As ever in Bitcoin’s development, upgrade parameters are in constant flux because no single person or organization has final say over how development should proceed. It’s up to Bitcoin’s distributed, international community to come to a consensus on what changes to make to Bitcoin and, just as important as evidenced by the Taproot activation discussion, how those changes will be brought online.      Take the so-called user-activated soft fork (UASF) that was so hotly debated during the Taproot activation discussions. This would give node operators the option to force-activate Taproot should miners fail to update their own nodes with the upgrade by rejecting blocks from noncompliant miners.      Miners have given no indication, though, that they will reject Taproot, and the UASF proposal lacked enough support to make its way into Bitcoin Core, the software implementation that 99% of the Bitcoin network runs.      Still, Luke Dashjr and others are coding a UASF that anyone can opt into (but which won't be included into Bitcoin Core) in case Speedy Trial fails. If Speedy Trial were to fail, then nothing would happen and Taproot would simply fail to activate. Under this scenario, a UASF could be deployed, probably next year, to bring the upgrade online.

42434052,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7MVh,1616602414,Bitcoin Traders Brace for Record $6B in Options to Expire Friday,"They call it “max pain” in the bitcoin options market: How to make one’s trading counterparty suffer the most.      Although the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands Wednesday around $56,500, traders were handicapping the odds of a plunge to about $44,000 by Friday, when a record $6 billion of options contracts is set to expire.      A drop to that price level would inflict “max pain” on buyers of options contracts, and it might be the most profitable price point for options sellers. It’s a remote risk, but not one to be discounted.      The max pain theory states that the market will gravitate toward the pain point while heading into the expiry. That's because sellers – typically institutions or sophisticated traders with ample capital supply – often try to push the price toward the max pain point by buying or selling the asset on spot or futures markets.      The bullish spin is that if bitcoin makes it through Friday without a major correction, a major overhang will be lifted.      ""Max pain for the March 26 expiry is currently $44,000 on Deribit,"" Luuk Strijers, CCO of Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange by trading volumes and open positions, told CoinDesk. ""That does not mean the market will move to $44,000 by the end of this week, but it does imply that after Friday this potential downward pressure no longer exists.""      Max pain is calculated by adding the outstanding put and call dollar value of each in-the-money (ITM) strike price. An ITM call is one where the strike price is below the spot market price, while a put is considered ITM when the spot market price is below the put option's strike price.      A potential unwinding of trades as Friday’s expiry approaches may inject some volatility into the market, according to Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of Delta Exchange.      Carry trading, or cash and carry arbitrage, is a market-neutral strategy that seeks to profit from increasing and decreasing prices in one or more markets. It involves buying the asset in the spot market and simultaneously selling a futures contract against it when the futures contract is trading at a significant premium to the spot price. That way, savvy traders can lock in fixed returns, as the futures price converges with the spot price on the day of expiry.      ""We also saw a lot of carry trades this expiry as the futures premium expanded from 15% to 25% per annum earlier this year,"" Balani said, adding that 60% of the short futures positions opened in carry trades are yet to be rolled over to the April expiry. Rolling over short futures means carryingover bearish positions from the current expiry to the next month.    Expiry may aggravate potential sell-off    The rollover, however, may not happen if the futures premium shrinks in the next two days. In simple words, carry trades will be squared off: Short futures positions will be squared off or allowed to expire, and the long positions held in the spot market could be dumped, leading to increased price volatility.      Also read: This Ether Options Play by Institutions Has Lottery Ticket Potential      ""If the premium on futures shrinks, then we can see the unwinding of the carry trade, which can increase short-term volatility on expiry day,"" Balani told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp call.      ""Traders have sold puts much more aggressively in this expiry,"" Balani said, adding that if the market starts falling due to some reason, these short put positions will be squared off. That would add to bearish pressures around the cryptocurrency ahead of the expiry.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/24/bitcoin-traders-brace-for-record-6b-in-options-to-expire-friday,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ec09b491e12b4662e64f08f7d01d471bff452cb-1280x640.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434048,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7Mxh,1616601572,The Node: Beeple Sold Out. So What?,"Not long after Mike Winkelmann, aka Beeple, received his $53 million in ether (ETH) for selling a non-fungible token (NFT) through Christie’s (after fees), he reportedly converted the cryptocurrency into fiat. What was seen as a vote of confidence for this new technological medium – it was the third-largest art sale ever, right behind Jeff Koons’ “Rabbit” and David Hockney’s “Portrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures)” – might now be seen as a betrayal.      He quite literally sold out.      Beeple told The New Yorker on Monday, “I’m not remotely a crypto-purist. I was making digital art long before any of this [nonsense], and if all this ... NFT stuff went away tomorrow I would still be making digital art.”      I was curious what other artists have done with their newfound fortunes made during the explosion of interest in NFTs. As competitive as any other art scene, NFT artists often face the added pressure of “crypto tribalism.” They don’t call it a blockchain for nothing.      Chris Torres, who sold several tokenized versions of the classic Nyan Cat meme for upwards of 400 ETH, said he was “surprised” to learn that Beeple had cashed out. Torres said he took out a small portion of his proceeds to pay for home repairs – including “a brand new fence because my current one is falling apart” – and other expenses. Some went to buy other people’s NFTs, like Paul Robertson’s, whose work has been featured on Cartoon Network.      The only thing Torres has splurged on was an electric bicycle, he said over email. The rest is staying in cold storage.      New York City-based artist Olive Allen has been making and selling NFTs since 2019. While her returns haven’t been staggering, her steadily built portfolio is enough “to exist” in New York City. She says she mostly hodls “with the exception of the money I need to cover my monthly expenses, stuff that enhances my art practice (like new graphic card), medical bills & etc.”      Then there’s Beeple’s contemporary, Ryder Ripps, who came to NFTs after a long career in digital art. He said he keeps about half his profits in ETH.      I reached out to Beeple to see what he’s done with the proceeds from earlier NFT sales but haven't heard back. To be sure, Beeple has long been skeptical of the current moment. He said on CoinDesk TV the morning after the historic sale that NFTs were a bubble. And he has long been thinking about how to bring his digital works into the physical world.      Beeple is anything but a turncoat, in fact he’s been remarkably consistent. For him, NFTs are a general purpose technology whose successful adoption does not hinge on the success or actions of any one artist.      It’s a mentality I think would be good for the rest of the crypto industry to adopt.

42434038,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7MZh,1616599139,Bitcoin-Based DeFi Project Sovryn Near Agreement on $10M Investment From ‘Pomp’,"Sovryn, a project that aims to bring decentralized finance (DeFi) to Bitcoin, is in the final stages of approving a 180 BTC investment from ""Pomp"" but only under certain circumstances.      Under the terms of the proposal, cryptocurrency evangelist Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano would invest 180 bitcoin, worth around $10 million at today’s prices.  While this might seem like yet another crypto investment story, this one is notable for the efforts Sovryn is taking to ensure that its existing token holders aren't marginalized simply because it’s getting a big investment.      While in most cases decentralized governance goes out the window when well-heeled investors come knocking, Sovyn’s decentralized governance community is taking things slow to make sure all members will continue to have a say in the project’s governance.      As of this writing, a deal had still not been finalized. Jascha Samadi, co-founder and partner at Berlin-based early-stage venture fund Greenfield One, which led a seed round in Sovryn in 2020, said this marks the shape of things to come when it comes to decentralized projects and investing.      “The standard way fundraising decisions happen is the team's treasury or the foundation's treasury simply raise money by selling tokens to private investors, and it happens in a very closed circle,” said Samadi. “This is the first time that we actually see a team bringing a proposal like this to their community at such an early stage into their journey.”      Community-based governance and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have evolved like everything else in the crypto space. As well as day-to-day decision making and software updates, decentralized governance structures vote on big choices relating to fundraising and stakeholders being added to the community.      The proposed $10 million investment would be made by Pompliano’s new asset management firm, Pomp Investments. Until last September, Pompliano was in charge of investments into crypto at Morgan Creek Digital Assets.      It’s worth noting that Sovryn is a buzzy project and earlier this month the community chose to sell $10 million worth of its SOV tokens. There are also conditions such as an extended lock-in period of 16 months for tokens.      While the investment itself is about bringing DeFi to Bitcoin, Pompliano agreed this marks a new chapter in decentralized investing.      “You will see more proposal-based investment as the crypto industry deepens, with decentralized communities deciding on investments rather than traditional, centralized and founder-based decision-making,” Pompliano said in an interview.      “DeFi” is the umbrella term for the exchange of cryptocurrencies or the lending and borrowing of them, carried out using business rules set out in computer code, which have typically flourished on the Ethereum public blockchain.      The Bitcoin blockchain, a straight up peer-to-peer payment network, is not the natural home for transactions that lock up funds, include outside data feeds and pay yields on assets. This requires some extra bells and whistles, which Sovryn adds in the form of parallel and uncluttered channels and enjoy the same unbreakable security as Bitcoin.      Sovryn project creator Edan Yago echoed Pompliano’s view of this as a new approach to investing.      “Many projects that are waving the flag of decentralization, but most of them ultimately have some kind of prime mover behind it,” Yago said in an interview. “I think one of the really interesting things with Sovryn is how radically and seriously the community takes this idea that there is no central authority behind the project.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/24/bitcoin-based-defi-project-sovryn-near-agreement-on-10m-investment-from-pomp,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a7db29a6aa0fef4422a4f3d1ee8caec79f9e16d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round gives this three-year-old Boston company a capital boost ahead of its data automation suite rollout planned for later this year. It signals continued investor interest in the companies working to monetize the DeFi space through secondary applications.      Cuban’s investment is his third bet on DeFi and blockchain projects since becoming an outspoken advocate for decentralized tech late last year. Since then he has introduced crypto payment options to the Dallas Mavericks, previewed a digital non-fungible token (NFT) art gallery and toured the podcast circuit talking up collectible digital assets.      ""Everything is driven by fast and accurate access to data. Which is exactly what Esprezzo excels at. Their product is 'fungibility at its best. It's adaptable. It's straightforward. It’s easy to configure and use,"" said Cuban in an email to CoinDesk.      Founder Remy Carpinito said Esprezzo’s automation tools simplify data pull requests for on-chain sources like smart contracts, an essential DeFi building block. He said the tool’s no-code user interface offers veteran users a means to feed data to trading bots and gives newcomers a workaround for technical pitfalls.    Esprezzo, data and the DeFi boom    DeFi refers to an ecosystem of products for lending, trading and exchanging digital assets, mostly through protocols atop the Ethereum blockchain. Traders are hungry for data that could give them an edge in the $43 billion DeFi sector.      After holding steady to a three-member team since pivoting to crypto in 2018, Carpinito said Esprezzo now plans to greatly expand its ranks to keep up with the DeFi boom. Its user base of 1,500 is growing rapidly, in large part due to the accelerating popularity of Esprezzo’s Uniswap trading pair discovery bot.      “Searching through block explorers was really the only method to see any on-chain data,” in 2018, Carpinito said, pointing to what he called a huge barrier to entry for retail traders and even experienced users. “We just want to make that as simple as possible.”    Read more: Mark Cuban on Bitcoin, NFTs and What Comes Next: ‘The Upside Is Truly Unlimited’    Carpinito said the funding from Cuban and other investors will go toward continued development of upcoming products like a more expansive notification platform called Dispatch that will cover protocols atop the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains when it launches in Q2.      Dispatch is “protocol agnostic,” said Carpinito.

Everybody would consider themselves a shopper.”      The ultimate goal is financial empowerment and financial inclusion, said Adelman, which are also key reasons Serena Williams and her team support Lolli.      “I'm excited to announce my investment in Lolli, a company on a mission to make bitcoin more accessible,” Williams said in a statement. “Earning and owning bitcoin is a step towards financial inclusivity for all people.”      Bitcoin reaching all-time highs recently close to $60,000 is also great news for an app built upon stacking sats.      “They say for a technology to be transformative, you need to be 10 times better than the predecessor,” said Adelman. “Since we launched, bitcoin has gone up by 11 or 12 times, so 10 times better than any cashback program out there.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/24/serena-williams-backs-5m-round-in-bitcoin-rewards-startup-lolli,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/429b8dd3fcca650ad24de94ba3ef876af41a7cb8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413316,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8MNs,1616590800,Shanghai-Backed Conflux Blockchain Wants to Bring DeFi to China,"The Chinese government doesn't officially allow its people to buy cryptocurrencies with cash, and the country is working on a digital version of its yuan that would be closely controlled by authorities.  But guess what is apparently allowed? Decentralized finance, known as DeFi, encompassing the fast-growing realm of mostly autonomous, blockchain-based software projects designed to automatically lend and exchange cryptocurrencies, and maybe someday replace banks.  Conflux, a blockchain startup backed by the city of Shanghai, said Wednesday it has formed a strategic partnership with the cryptocurrency exchange OKEx's decentralized public blockchain, OKExChain, to help DeFi projects enter the Chinese market. Conflux claims to be the only ""public, permissionless"" blockchain endorsed by the government. The term ""permissionless"" indicates that control over the network is decentralized.  The partnership will allow Conflux to ""wrap"" tokens from selected DeFi projects with its native token CFX, which was recently listed on OKEx. In crypto industry jargon, ""wrapping"" a token means it's retrofitted into a new token that can move over another blockchain, similar to the way a truck trailer might be loaded onto a railroad car.  The Conflux project could help these emerging DeFi projects to receive ""full support"" of the OKExChain ecosystem, a representative from Conflux told CoinDesk. OKEx, the exchange behind OKExChain, is one of the so-called Big Three cryptocurrency exchanges closely linked to the Chinese market, including Binance and Huobi.  “Conflux is the only regulatory-compliant public, permissionless chain in China because we specifically did not have a public token sale, which has allowed us to remain compliant and in good standing within China,” a company representative told CoinDesk. DeFi projects “don’t necessarily need Conflux to enter the Asia market, but Conflux-wrapped assets are considered regulator-friendly in China, so we’re offering a compliant way for projects to list on a public exchange in China.”  As part of the announcement, Conflux revealed eight new DeFi projects in the first cohort of its program, all of which will have their tokens wrapped to CFX and can move freely between Conflux and OKExChain. These ""wrapped tokens"" are backed by an equal amount of CFX, the news release said.  Read More: Shanghai Government Invests $5M in Blockchain Startup Conflux  The company told CoinDesk that even though initial coin offerings (ICOs) and fiat-to-crypto trading are not allowed in China, crypto-to-crypto trading is not banned, meaning that Conflux can “remain compliant and serve as a point of entry for projects interested in entering the local market.”  “The Chinese government is mainly trying to protect its citizens while seeking to better understand the value of public blockchain technology,” the company said.  Little known to the Western world, Conflux has received considerable attention in China both from state and media outlets. The company recently received millions of dollars in grant money from the Shanghai Science and Technology Committee and Xuhui District government, part of Shanghai’s municipal government.  A video clip on state-owned satellite TV station Dragon Television described the Conflux blockchain as having been “developed by Shanghai.” The report went on to note that the network's performance has exceeded that of Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of transactions per second and transaction confirmation times.  On Weibo, China’s equivalent to Twitter, some users even called CFX the “Shanghai token” due to the startup’s close relationship with the Shanghai government.  ""It's very encouraging to see such high-quality blockchain projects like Conflux Network that are committed to transparency, decentralization, interoperability and regulatory compliance partnering with OKExChain,"" Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx, told CoinDesk through a representative. ""These are the qualities that will enable strong and sustainable growth moving forward and attract developer talent from the wider ecosystem.""  UPDATE (March 24, 2021, 14:25 UTC): In an earlier version of this article CoinDesk reported the eight DeFi tokens selected by Conflux would be wrapped to CFX tokens and traded on OKEx, based on a company press release. After publication, representatives from OKEx and Conflux clarified the DeFi tokens would not necessarily be listed for trading on OKEx, but that the selected DeFi tokens can move freely between Conflux and OKExChain.",POSITIVE,CFX,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | CFX | TOKEN SALE,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/24/shanghai-backed-conflux-blockchain-wants-to-bring-defi-to-china,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1d24a0cf1e6574722787f42bfde8c07beeb18d5-1920x1281.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434039,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7Mjh,1616589524,"MMT, Crypto and the New Nature of Money","Money used to be a reward for value creation. Today, money is used to create value.      Since leaving the gold standard, money has essentially been backed by faith in the issuing government. This would be the preface to now-fashionable Modern Monetary Theory. No longer having to fear the shortage of gold, governments are free to print the money needed to fully employ their available resources. In other words, MMT views currency as a public good rather than a medium of exchange.    Sofia Blikstad is an analyst at Arcane Research.    In 2008, Bitcoin was created in response to this very concept. Fundamentally different but joint in their controversy, both ideas have re-entered the mainstream conversation as we enter the post-pandemic world. At the moment, there is no consensus on either.      The fiscal response to the COVID-19 pandemic comes with unprecedented costs. The European Central Bank’s (ECB) balance sheet expansion – up €2.42 trillion since the beginning of 2020 – has been remarkable compared with its roughly €1 trillion response in 2008-2009. Interest rates remain at all-time lows, while debt levels have reached all-time highs.      See also: Michael Casey - Why Quantitative Easing Is Here to Stay      During 2020, the joint budget deficits of European Area governments soared to 11.6% of GDP in Q2, more than four times the 2.5% deficit recorded in Q1, and well surpassing the 7% deficit recorded in Q1 of 2010.      Central bank policies have since been fueling markets everywhere, fostering a widening wealth gap and the notorious “BRRR” memes. While the money printer is running at full speed, here is a breakdown of how central bank monetary policy relates to crypto prices.    Quantitative easing    Central banks increase the rate of growth by cutting interest rates to encourage consumer spending, thereby increasing the effective demand and ultimately profitability. However, when interest rates are approaching zero, they are left with the option of injecting money directly into the economy by buying financial securities. This process is known as quantitative easing (QE) and has the following effects:    Bond prices increase as their demand increases  Interest rates are reduced  Banks have more money reserved than required and the money supply in the economy increases.    When asset prices increase and interest rates are low, risk premiums get twisted. As a rule of thumb, cash is safer than bonds, which are safer than equities, which are safer than alternative investments. However, when bond coupons are at 0% and the money printer is running on max, equities and digital assets don't look that risky. This ultimately triggers a rally for all assets, including ones that previously were associated with the greatest risk.      Simultaneously, as the ECB continues to increase the stimulus, it is widening the wealth gap. Investors take profits and are incentivized to invest more, asset prices go up, and investors are rewarded. Rather than boosting general consumption, it boosts the inclination to invest. This is essentially how low interest rates enrich Wall Street while Main Street falls behind.    When bond coupons are at 0%, and the money printer is running on max, equities and digital assets don't look that risky.    This creates an anti-corporate sentiment, driving governments to spend more on the people for the sake of keeping voters content. Thereby the MMT-style policies and addiction to QE. On an individual level, it is difficult to accept lower wages and higher taxes, although the overall economy would benefit from borrowing relative to the growth of the economy. Thus the only politically viable solution is to print more money.    (Not so) modern monetary theory    The recent comeback of MMT was triggered by U.S left-wing economists, who presented it as a solution for expensive political projects.      The essence of MMT is that budget deficits are irrelevant, because sovereign currency-issuing governments cannot default on their sovereign debt as they can always print more money. The only real constraint on governments is the availability of resources. If resources are available, governments can pay for them by printing money. If they aren’t available, printing money to buy goods will cause inflation.      As a consequence, taxes do not finance spending. Instead, the government taxes for two reasons (i) to drain excess money out of the economy to control inflation and (ii) to stimulate the circulation of the government currency. It makes sense to earn and spend euros if you pay taxes in euros. In a no-growth economy, however, that means the money supply would continue to increase, which must be unsustainable.      See also: Michael Casey - Money Reimagined: How a Dangerous Idea Could Work      In a monetarist view, prices increase because the value of money decreases. This brings us to what money ultimately is: a store of value. If money is to realize its function, people must have confidence in its ability to retain its value over time. This makes fiat a melting ice cube.      Now, increasing government deficits drive the government to sell more debt to pay for the stimulus. This is causing interest rates to increase so governments can sell that debt in an already leveraged-long economy. However, as increased interest rates would stall the economy, they will instead buy the debt by printing money. In turn, that leaves investors with money that is becoming increasingly worthless, ultimately devaluing the currency and threatening it as a store of value.      Although the Euro-Area remains relatively stable, when there is boundless money printing, investors will avoid holding debt tied in a depreciating currency. If the public believes its government is becoming spendthrift, inflation expectations will become rooted in preventive price-rises, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.    Enter bitcoin    Bitcoin and its genesis block were the preface to a digital alternative to traditional central banks and government spending and has since programmatically reformed money as we know it. Instead of governments inflating the supply of money, Bitcoin has introduced an alternative known as a distributed ledger, otherwise known as a blockchain, granting universal access and a predictable and programmable inflation schedule.      In cases of hyperinflation like Venezuela and Zimbabwe, Bitcoin could theoretically become an economic escape-hatch allowing individuals to hedge from a local economic meltdown. Non-sovereign money allows people to reject their local monetary systems. The way countries like Zimbabwe have adopted Bitcoin is not unlike the currency substitution (dollarization) we’ve seen in many emerging countries struggling to maintain the integrity of their monetary systems.    When we understand that the world is structured by belief, we understand that value can be an illusion.    For now, Bitcoin upholds the ""digital gold"" narrative – a store of value that is easily exchanged and practically impossible to counterfeit. Given its fixed supply, it is deflationary in nature.      Bitcoin is not truly deflationary in the sense that Bitcoin’s supply will not decrease but continue to increase until the block rewards run out approaching the year 2140, when Bitcoin will reach a hard cap of 21 million coins. MMT, on the other hand, promotes the printing press as a cure-all and rejects monetary policies’ relevance to inflation.    So where does it leave us?    Imagine doing the same thing over and over again, to hardly any relief. Enter quantitative-easing hell.      Ideally, we would slowly stop quantitative easing and match the money supply to meet the output gap. If it was only that easy.      The ongoing rally in the stock markets can largely be attributed to the growing expectations of economic recovery, suggesting that stock markets more than ever depend on the ECB’s every move. If there are any signs of economic weakness by Spring, the ECB will find a way to maintain the bond buying.      See also: Eva Lawrence - How Institutions Will Take Crypto Mainstream      Ironically, the wall of liquidity that hit the public markets was to find its way to the crypto markets. But speculation aside, there are a number of other narratives justifying a bullish move higher for crypto. The two main long-term justifications are (i) potential store-of-value and (ii) currency.      Bitcoin’s volatility impedes its case as a store of value. However, for those who consider hedging potential inflation risk with a limited-supply asset that can be easily exchanged for fiat, the idea of “digital gold” is very relevant. One could even claim that Bitcoin is far more valuable than gold, considering its increased utility in terms of buying, transferring, and storing it.      Cryptocurrency as a recognized currency might be harder to imagine, but not everyone has access to the banking products we take for granted. Bitcoin is an attractive substitute to fiat allowing for easy transactions while maintaining privacy and erasing geographical borders. But circling back to the beginning, the first and most vital component is trust.      When we understand that the world is structured by belief, we understand that value can be an illusion. Money is an abstract concept. Its value requires us to believe in it, which is why banks use ancestral heroes to make money seem almost holy.      Crypto is as much of an idea as all other money; its value lies merely in belief. But instead of banks and central authorities, it is pure code. Transparent in its mechanism but private in its use, central bank currencies are the exact opposite. Their management is obscured, but our use is surveilled.      Who knows what will happen, but it is ironic that QE is reinforcing Bitcoin when it was born in opposition to said policy.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Sofia Blikstad,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/24/mmt-crypto-and-the-new-nature-of-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63761629978193aab1f422d601f44e1c4b2de0c3-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434037,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7Mhh,1616587178,DeFi Should Look Beyond Tech Hubs for Growth,"When asked to identify the next proving ground of decentralized finance (DeFi), most people would probably point to Silicon Valley, Hong Kong, London or any other high-powered tech hub where innovation is only ever a corner block away. They probably wouldn’t pick a remote farming village built so far out from the nearest town that getting to a bank is a four-hour endeavor.      But maybe they should.      There’s no mistaking DeFi’s ascension into a global financial phenomenon. In the span of a year, the total value locked in DeFi markets spiked from $631 million to more than $41 billion. Some decentralized trading platforms regularly handle tens of billions in volume every month; automated loan providers can now facilitate loans that top $200 million.    Kor Kiang Sean, co-founder of Centaur, has five years of experience in the blockchain industry ranging from mining rig configuration to smart contract and blockchain development.    These metrics represent growth so unbelievable that if it weren’t plainly recorded, you’d dismiss it as fantasy. Faced with them, one can’t help but think the seeds of a DeFi revolution have already taken root. To borrow a quip from the noted cryptocurrency proponent and co-founder of the Gemini exchange, Tyler Winklevoss, “Software is eating the world. DeFi is the software that is starting to eat Wall Street.”      But is it? While it’s undoubtedly true that DeFi’s growth has been explosive and prompted interest among traditional banks and other financial players, it hasn’t turned into a consumer movement.      “The space is very experimental,” Hong Fang, the CEO of OKCoin, told American Banker earlier this year. “I don't think we will wake up tomorrow and see banks, Nasdaq or Fidelity being taken out. This is still a pioneer sector. People who are crypto literate will be attracted to it.”    Proponents in tech hubs want DeFi for philosophical reasons. But they don’t have a practical need for it.    Fang’s point rather neatly sums up the crux of the matter. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts look at DeFi's expansion and celebrate the potential for achieving truly transparent, accountable and democratic money management. Other consumers see the boom, raise their eyebrows and promptly return to their conventional banking app.      Cryptocurrency proponents in tech hubs want DeFi for philosophical reasons. But they don’t have a practical need for it. Sure, DeFi could enable anyone with an internet connection and a smartphone to make payments, access credit and otherwise engage with the financial system – but most people in developed economies can already do that.      While the news that DeFi could facilitate a more efficient, democratic and secure financial system is interesting to these consumers, it does not shock them. Moreover, because consumers’ day-to-day banking needs are already met by established banking institutions, their motivation to switch from fiat to crypto or take the time to understand DeFi technology is limited at best.      When added to the fact that DeFi already faces significant hurdles of regulatory uncertainty and niche use cases, it’s no wonder that DeFi hasn’t become a go-to financial fix in established markets.      See also: Why It’s Time to Pay Attention to Mexico’s Booming Crypto Market      But what of emerging markets?      Think about it. Who has a more practical need for DeFi solutions, people who already manage their money through the bank around the corner or people who don’t have a bank?      According to research published by the World Bank, about 1.7 billion adults worldwide are currently unbanked, meaning they do not have an account with a financial institution or mobile money provider. Moreover, because banking is so well-established as to be nearly universal in high-income countries, the vast majority of the unbanked reside in developing economies. China currently has the most unbanked adults (225 million), though India (190 million), Pakistan (100 million), and Indonesia (95 million) have high rates of unbanked residents as well.      The consequences of not having access to financial services can be severe. People who are unbanked have little to no ability to send or save money safely; they cannot access loans or make purchases without cash. According to the report mentioned above, the most commonly-cited barrier to opening an account was not having enough money. But researchers noted that these consumers aren’t necessarily opposed to banking.      “Worldwide, 30% of adults without an account at a financial institution said that they do not need one, making this the second most common reason cited. Yet only 3% cited it as their only reason for not having an account,” the researchers pointed out. “This suggests that among those reporting lack of need as one of several reasons, some might be open to using financial services if the services are accessible and relevant to their lives.”    Enthusiasts may innovate, but it’s consumers who truly push new products to market success.    The need for unconventional banking services exists in emerging economies, far more so than it does in established ones. Given intuitive interfaces and the proper packaging, unbanked people and businesses could present a significant opportunity for DeFi growth.      Consider the factors at hand. Digital devices are becoming cheaper and more accessible than ever before, with two-thirds of unbanked persons owning a mobile phone. By 2018, over half (3.9 billion) people were using the internet, and 2 billion were managing their money online. The infrastructure, interest and need for wholly-digital, blockchain-secured services is clearly already there – all that remains is for DeFi proponents to provide consumer-friendly solutions.      It’s also worth noting that rolling out unconventional financial solutions to unbanked communities isn’t a new challenge; it’s been done before and successfully. Consider the expansion of M-Pesa in Kenya as an example. This mobile money system, which debuted in 2007 and now has 72% penetration, allows users to make a deposit or get cash via texting – no smartphone or computer required. These transactions are facilitated by human agents, who linger at set locations and serve more or less like ATMs.      As one Vox journalist concluded, “In countries where almost no one has a bank account or a bank branch, agents represent a huge step forward in the availability of cash when you need it and a safe place to deposit it when you don’t.”      See also: Mohammad Raafi Hossain – Why Impact Investing and Crypto Are Mutually Beneficial      The benefits of the mobile money system are well-demonstrated, too. One study conducted in 2016 found that people who lived closer to mobile money agents were significantly less likely to be living in poverty, let alone extreme poverty. Mobile money systems like M-Pesa are very different from decentralized apps (dapps). However, the program’s resounding success demonstrates that unbanked consumers will flock to digitally-facilitated solutions that meet their financial needs.      If we want DeFi to become a functional standard and create a blueprint that works, we need to stop focusing on tech hubs that already have banking solutions and look to places that need the support dapps provide. Enthusiasts may innovate, but it’s consumers who truly push new products to market success.

42434051,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7N3h,1616585400,Valid Points: How Ethereum’s Governance Process Alters ‘The Merge’,"The Ethereum developer community is pushing with guns blazing toward proof-of-stake (PoS). But a few speed bumps remain in the way, especially when reflecting on the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process.      Last Friday, Ethereum developers began spitballing possible dates for merging the Eth 2.0 client, the Beacon Chain, and the current Ethereum network, Eth 1.x, also known as Ethpow. One idea circulating among developer communities slates ""The Merge"" for after July’s London hard fork in the subsequent hard fork, Shanghai.      For context, Ethereum has two more hard forks in the immediate future: The Berlin hard fork in April and the London hard fork. Those two hard forks will introduce technical changes to Ethpow, but are unlikely to include any updates necessary to The Merge. Indeed, as Vitalik Buterin spelled out two weeks ago in the “quick merge” write-up, the Beacon Chain and Ethpow could likely be mushed together with few alterations to either chain.    Slow and steady governance    However, that’s not how governance is done on Ethereum. Proposals take as long as three months to six years for inclusion, EIP editor Micah Zoltu said in a private message. Every proposal requires a “champion” to spearhead the proposal and ample amounts of free time to shepherd the idea into production. In fact, given the hype for PoS, Zoltu said the rate of future EIPs being accepted for inclusion will likely decline as everyone focuses on The Merge.      “It'll probably slow things down tremendously as everyone will be busy with The Merge,” he said. “Everyone will be focused on The Merge and so the rate at which people get feedback on EIPs will slow.”      In terms of similarly large proposals, EIP 1559 may act as a guiding star for implementing the merge. Both proposals have large support among Ethereum developer and user communities, both proposals introduce outsized changes to the Ethereum blockchain and both proposals have had or will have to jump through numerous hurdles before being included in the code bank.      For context, EIP 1559 was first submitted in April 2019 and took about two years of research and analysis before being selected for inclusion. However, enthusiasm for the proposal was whipped into a fury this past summer, particularly with the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi).      Similar to DeFi rousing support for EIP 1559, resentment and frustration between Ethereum developers and the mining communities is already proving to be a catalyst for The Merge. So, when will PoS happen? Ethereum developers planned on implementing the change by the end of the year. Yet, if history is any guide, one calendar year is perhaps the best approximation.    Pulse check: Our validator ‘Zelda’ signs a second block    If you’re new to Valid Points and the topic of Ethereum 2.0 in general, be sure to check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics to get up to speed about terminology used throughout this newsletter.      Zelda signed her second block this past week, boosting her total income earned since being activated on the Eth 2.0 network by 5% to 0.2354 ETH, worth roughly $392 at time of writing.      Eth 2.0 validators can go days, if not weeks, before being assigned the responsibility of proposing and signing off a block. This is because a single validator is randomly assigned this responsibility at every slot, which means Zelda has a one in 110,000 chance of being chosen. The 110,00 figure is the total number of active validators in the system. The higher this number gets, the lower the probability of being assigned a block.      The rarity of these events is part of what makes them special. The other parts include being able to include “graffiti,” which are custom messages you can write onto Eth 2.0’s immutable blockchain ledger, and earning a 60% higher daily reward for validator operations. Each time Zelda was assigned to sign a block, our daily rewards for that day increased from roughly 0.007 ETH to 0.011.    CoinDesk data dashboard    Most days, Zelda’s responsibilities are block attestations, of which there are two main types. The more frequent of the two is known as unaggregated attestations. The Ethereum 2.0 network is split in 64 sections, also known as “subnets” or “sub-networks.” Each time a validator makes a block attestation it publishes the associated data on one of these subnets.      At times, Zelda will perform an extra step after publishing her block attestation. She may also be responsible for aggregating attestations communicated by other validators on different subnets into one succinct message. This message gets pushed up into a higher level of Ethereum 2.0’s network on which blocks are ultimately produced, processed and finalized.      While aggregated block attestations are more infrequent than unaggregated ones, they still happen more frequently than block proposals. Since being activated on Eth 2.0, Zelda has made two block proposals, 960 aggregated block attestations and roughly 7,600 unaggregated block attestations.      As a final note and fun fact about Eth 2.0, this multi-level system depends in large part on Boneh-Lynn-Schacham (BLS) signatures, which is the cryptography that enables messages from Ethereum’s subnets to be aggregated efficiently and securely every few minutes on the network.

Support for more assets will be added in the coming months.  “As exorbitant gas fees continue to cripple the community, we must bring scalability and cheaper transactions to Ethereum now,” Hermez tech lead Jordi Baylina said in a statement. “We are now inviting developers, projects and users from around the world to join us on this journey towards a significantly cheaper and decentralized future.”  Read more: Ethereum’s Top Dapps Are Increasingly Turning to ‘Rollups’: Here’s Why  Rollups: Easing transaction bottlenecks on Ethereum  Rollups are quickly becoming the preferred solution for Ethereum’s transaction bottleneck problem, both in the zero knowledge proof (zk-rollup) and Optimistic rollup (ORU) flavors. A recent rise in user activity spiked gas prices throughout the early winter months, prompting a move to rollups.

Andreessen Horowitz-backed Optimism and Union Square Ventures-backed Matter Labs are the industry’s two heavyweights in the field.

42386208,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBS5hb,1616578865,Ethereum's Vlad Zamfir Files Injunction Against CasperLabs Citing Copyright Infringement,"Ethereum Foundation researcher Vlad Zamfir has filed a complaint against blockchain startup CasperLabs alleging the company has violated U.S. Federal trademark law.      According to a court document filed on March 17, Zamfir is accusing the startup of labeling its proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol ""Casper"" and for filing for federal registration of the Casper mark.      The issue, Zamfir claims, is that CasperLabs has improperly used the mark to benefit commercially while causing confusion and damage because Zamfir's own PoS research, stretching six years back, is of the same name.      Zamfir says he and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin developed a PoS protocol called ""Casper"" in 2015 that was then followed with a first draft version in 2017.      The Casper protocol 1.0 specification then went live in 2018, where it was subsequently picked up by CasperLabs the following year after hiring Zamfir as its lead consensus protocol architect.      CasperLabs began building a new blockchain based on Zamfir's version of PoS called the ""Highway Protocol.""      A licensing agreement was drawn up in 2019, Zamfir argues, that provided limited use of the name Casper and Zamfir's research.      ""I ... made it clear ... I did not consent to CasperLabs’ use of the name Casper,"" said Zamfir in the complaint. The Ethereum researcher argues CasperLabs filed a federal registration of the Casper mark without his knowledge or consent.      It is alleged the startup later changed the name to ""Casper Highway Protocol"" and then finally ""Casper"" when it sought to launch a coin sale on Tuesday.      As such, Zamfir has filed a civil action for false designation of origin under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 1125(a) and for the ""substantial and related claim"" of unfair competition under the common law of California.      Zamfir points specifically to Section 43(a) of the act which stipulates that is unlawful for any person to use words or images for commerce that would otherwise cause confusion among others.      In a first supplemental declaration filed in the U.S. District Court Southern District of California on Monday, Zamfir said he had first learned of CasperLabs' U.S. trademark registration and application on Jan. 25, 2021.      See also: Hearing in SEC Case Positive for Ripple, XRP, Says Lawyer      In the declaration, Zamfir alleges CasperLabs changed its Telegram channel name to Casper a month after Zamfir had learned of the registration and application.

42386217,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBS5vR,1616578308,Bitcoin Rises Despite Dollar Strength as Elon Musk Adds BTC Payment Option,"Bitcoin (BTC) jumped early Wednesday after the Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the electric vehicle maker is now accepting the cryptocurrency as a payment option. Musk's Twitter announcement overshadowed the dollar's strength, helping the cryptocurrency stay bid.      ""You can now buy a Tesla with [b]itcoin,"" Musk tweeted at 7:02 UTC (3:02 a.m. ET), adding the cryptocurrency received in payments won't be converted to cash, meaning the company is adding to its already sizable stash of bitcoin.      Bitcoin rose from $54,700 to above $56,000 following Musk's announcement, having defended support at $53,000 on Tuesday. Tesla announced in early February it had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, validating the cryptocurrency's appeal as a reserve asset.      While the electric vehicle maker's acceptance of crypto as payment will undoubtedly grab the headlines, it's something Musk had said he likely would do when he announced Tesla's bitcoin investment earlier this year. What's at least as significant is his statement that Tesla operates its own bitcoin nodes as it shows the company - and its CEO - are committing even further to the cryptocurrency.      ""Tesla accepting bitcoin payments and running its own Bitcoin nodes is massively bullish. Others will follow,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted.      Musk's announcement comes two days after Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell called bitcoin a volatile speculative asset.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $55,300, representing a 3.6% gain on the day. The cryptocurrency is trading higher despite the strength of the U.S. dollar in the foreign exchange markets. The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against majors, has risen to 92.52 – the highest level since Nov. 24.      The two assets have mainly moved in opposite directions since March 2020. However, the inverse correlation has weakened somewhat in recent days, with bitcoin trading steady above $50,000 amid the DXY's rise to four-month highs.      The cryptocurrency is now fast approaching a descending trendline hurdle, as seen on the chart below.      A breakout above the trendline hurdle would open the doors for a re-test of record highs above $61,000. On the downside, $53,000 is key support.

42386222,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBS61j,1616551677,BitClout's Alleged Leader Hit With Cease-and-Desist by Prominent Crypto Law Firm,"Brandon Curtis, the product lead for decentralized token exchange Radar Relay, has fired a legal warning shot at the alleged creator of controversial social network BitClout for using Curtis' likeness without his consent.      Anderson Kill P.C., the law firm representing Curtis, has sent a letter to Nadar Al-Naji, formally claiming the former Basis founder breached California's civil codes. BitClout is a social media network that issues ""creator coins"" (paid for in bitcoin) corresponding to different users. The platform appears to use profiles pulled from Twitter, regardless of whether the Twitter user has actually signed up to BitClout or not.      The cease-and-desist letter is the latest twist in the odd tale of BitClout, a controversial project whose founders have gone by pseudonyms. While one of those founders, who goes by the handle Diamondhands, claims BitClout offers a new way to monetize a social following, others have balked at several aspects of the rollout, including the current inability to trade out of the BTCLT token once it is purchased.      Anderson Kill doesn't specify how it tied Al-Naji to BitClout, only writing that it is ""a project that we understand was launched by you and is under your control.""      James Prestwich, the founder of decentralized finance startup Summa (acquired by Celo), also claimed that Al-Naji is behind BitClout, citing ""personal knowledge."" CoinDesk attempted to contact Al-Naji, but did not receive a reply by press time.      ""It is well established that a person or company cannot knowingly use another's name, voice, signature, photograph or likeness, in any manner ... for purpose of ... selling, or soliciting purchases,"" the letter reads.      Curtis' lawyers cite California's Civil Code section 3344, which protects an individual's right to profit from the commercial value of his or her own identity and is established throughout the U.S. in both statute and common law.      Section 1798 of California Civil Code, which was also cited by Anderson Kill, protects an individual's right to privacy in the state.      The lawyers also state that any person found in violation of the code is liable to pay either $750 or actual damages incurred by BitClout's alleged actions for the ""unauthorized use"" of Curtis' identity as well as any profit collected in such actions.      See also: What Is BitClout? The Social Media Experiment Sparking Controversy on Twitter      ""In order for Mr. Curtis to exercise any sort of control over his name .... he would need to put his own money into your project or provide ... personal information,"" the letter reads. ""Even messaging BitClout's support team costs BitClout tokens.""      The lawyers argue the only way for Curtis to use BitClout's site or control his profile is by buying tokens issued by the platform or by providing his telephone number.      ""Mr. Curtis has no contractual relationship of any kind with you nor any desire to form one,"" the letter reads. As such the lawyers are asking Al-Naji to cease and desist from the ""unlawful use"" of Curtis' name and photo. Lawyers are also requesting Al-Naji cease and desist from engaging in further violation of Curtis' privacy rights.      Preston Byrne, one of the lawyers who signed the letter, had previously asked BitClout to remove his profile on the platform, which the company apparently did.      ""The right of publicity means an individual should be able to decide how they profit from the commercial value of their likeness and what organizations they collaborate with,"" said Hailey Lennon, another Anderson Kill partner who signed the letter, in a statement.      Byrne and Lennon are both veterans of the blockchain startup world and members of the technology, media and distributed systems practice at Anderson Kill chaired by seasoned litigator Stephen Palley, who also signed the letter.
