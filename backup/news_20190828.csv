The crypto exchange looked at the world’s top 50 universities (according to the U.S. News & World Report ranking) and found that 56 percent have blockchain or crypto classes available. Last year, Coinbase found 42 percent to offer such classes.  Working with survey site Qriously, Coinbase also surveyed 735 students ages 16 and older, finding a 6 percent uptick in student interest in crypto or blockchain coursework. As part of last year’s Coinbase study, 28 percent of respondents said they would be interested in such a class.  Moreover, compared to last year, twice as many university students, or 18 percent, partook in a crypto or blockchain class.  Of special note, said Coinbase, is the percent of crypto or blockchain classes not falling under the traditional computer-science label. Coinbase said 70 percent of these classes pertained to other departments – particularly finance, economics, law or engineering.  [caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""2048""]Crypto classes by department. (Image via Coinbase)[/caption]  Student clubs are also a major driver of academic interest.

Wethaq, a “platform-as-a-service” firm, aims to use R3 Corda’s blockchain to manage the pre-sale, issuance, management and financialization of Sukuk securities, Islamic financial certificates similar to bonds.  According to the International Islamic Financial Market Annual Sukuk Report 2019, the total issuance of Sukuk reached $123.15 billion in 2018, representing a 5 percent increase from $116.7 billion in 2017.  The blockchain platform will digitize Sukuk, decreasing both the cost and time of issuance, a process that currently involves input from a number of banks, clearing houses and trustee entities. Corda will streamline this ""lifecycle."" Further, Corda may enable wider distribution, and therefore more issuers and investors, by standardizing the digital assets with global financial architecture.  David E. Rutter, CEO of R3, said, “Blockchain is driving an unprecedented period of innovation across capital markets, with more assets moving towards complete digitization,” adding:  “Saudi Arabia and the wider Middle East region are areas where we see huge potential for Corda to modernize the economy and our partnership with Wethaq is a step towards achieving that.”  Beginning in 2018, Wethaq began working on a proof-of-concept for a blockchain solution to Sukuk management. The aim being to have distributed ledger operate as a registry and central securities depository, improve interoperability with other settlements and payments platforms, and create a network for market participants, providers and regulators to communicate.  The firm also sought regulatory approval from jurisdictional and Shariah bodies. In light of the highly regulated Islamic environment, “the employability of ‘smart clauses’ gives Shariah boards the opportunity to ensure Shariah compliance by building and mapping real world Shariah requirements within the structure itself,"" R3 and Wethaq wrote in a joint report.

The Santiago Stock Exchange (STE), Central Securities Depository (DCV) and the Global Trade Directory (GTD) will form a blockchain association for this task, according to a BNamericas report, published August 27.  The so-called Technology Consortium will examine use cases for blockchain in the financial sector, specifically in improving communications for domestic and international investors in the Chilean stock exchange.  Within 18 months, the association looks to institute the Business Blockchain Network that will operate a collection of nodes. Reportedly this interconnectivity will “reduce applications, times, and costs of administrative processes.”  “Innovation is a strategic pillar for the Santiago Stock Exchange. Through this Consortium we seek to generate the best conditions for the stock and financial business, with innovative and world-class solutions,” said the general manager of the Santiago Stock Exchange, José Antonio Martínez.  Last year, the STE implemented the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger framework to support short selling and other financial instruments. The Hyperledger network is marketed as an enterprise-focused, permissioned blockchain. In recent months, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) also began integrating parts of the software.  Over the next six months, the consortirum will begin defining and finalizing the project’s details with input from affected institutions. Production releases are expected at 6 month intervals thereafter.

Blockchain firm Constellation yesterday announced a partnership with the U.S. Air Force to help automate the armed force branch's big data management. According to a statement from Constellation, data sources like drones, planes, and satellites present unique use-cases for DLT. Constellation helps secure data silos from traditionally locked sources.  Termed Multi-Domain Command and Control by the U.S. Air Force, Constellation is tasked with connecting various data silos for the armed force wing, thereby improving interoperability. The firm will also provide audit trails and real-time overviews of data sources.  ""Currently, the data lifecycle is very broken with data storage being siloed while data creation, management, and hygiene is a semi-manual process,"" Constellations Mathias Goldman told CoinDesk. ""The USAF is looking to automate much of their big data initiatives in a secure manner.""  Constellation's job is to build systems between creation, storage, and management for future decision making. The platform allows users to manage downstream data flows with encryption, according to the statement.

Yesterday, French cybersecurity, officials dubbed ""cyber gendarmes,"" announced the disabling of a botnet force 850,000 servers strong operating mostly in Latin America. The botnet head was located in France and was inoculating computers with monero crypto-jacking software, according to a BBC report.  A malicious form of computer predation, crypto-jacking involves remotely and secretly installing crypto mining software onto computers. Infected computers bare electrical and maintenance costs while hackers walk away with the crypto.  The virus was first spotted by private firm Avast in the spring. An email promising money or erotic images linked to the virus and in certain cases infected USB drives also carried the virus.  While the number of machines infected is known, the amount stolen is not. Official estimates run into the millions of euros with the culprits still on the run.  French officials tracked the head pirate server to Île-de-France. The server has been in operation since 2016, utilizing the Retadup virus to crypto jack computers along with stealing personal data from Israeli hospitals, among other nefarious acts.  Over the next six months, French officials shut down the server while moving the virus to unused parts of the web.  “Basically, we managed to detect where was the command server, the control tower of the network of infected computers, the 'botnet,’” said Jean-Dominique Nollet to France Inter Radio, head of the Center for Combating Digital Crime (C3N). “It was copied, replicated with a server of ours, and made to do things that allow the virus to be idle on the victims' computers,” he continued.  While a large achievement for the French authorities, Nollet warned rebooting the hack was nearly as easy as a copy and paste command. “Unfortunately we know they can recreate this kind of hacker server at any time,” he said.  Earlier this month, data analysis company Carbon Black released a study on another monero botnet force, infecting some 500,000 servers, operating across eastern Europe and parts of Asia.

Written by a collective of crypto thinkers, the book, according to its publisher, ""tells the story of what’s wrong with money today, and why Bitcoin was invented to provide an alternative to the current system.""  ""It describes in simple terms what Bitcoin is, how it works, why it’s valuable, and how it affects individual freedom and opportunities of people everywhere – from Nigeria to the Philippines to Venezuela to the United States,"" wrote Song.  Interestingly, the book took just a few days to write. Song told CoinDesk the origin story, beginning with a meeting in Oslo.  ""It really came together at the Oslo Freedom Forum earlier this year when a bunch of us that were in bitcoin got together and we talked about possibly doing something like this,"" Song told Dale. ""We wrote it in Redwood City, California. We rented a house and we each had our own bedrooms and bathrooms but we pretty much worked in the common areas. It was like four days.""  The book aims to make it easier to understand bitcoin in the context of real usage and real economies and Song hopes it will be an educational and helpful addition to the crypto canon. In fact, Song sees the book as a calling card for crypto.  ""The purpose of this book is to give [people] the idea of why [bitcoin] is valuable, why it matters at all,"" Song said.

Eun Sung-soo's comments, which were delivered in written form to a parliamentary committee ahead of his Thursday confirmation hearing for the top post at the Financial Services Commission (FSC), suggest that uncertainty will remain and that most activity will continue for some time in legal and regulatory gray areas.  His comments were carried in a variety of local publications, including the Chosun Ilbo.  Eun wrote that laws related to cryptocurrencies, which have been languishing in the National Assembly, need to be passed as soon as possible. These include amendments to the Specific Financial Information Act, which focus on reporting, transparency and anti-money laundering.  At the same time, the nominee alluded to the speculative fever peaking in January 2018, specifically referencing the Kimchi Premium, and noted the risks potentially caused by cryptocurrencies. He expressed skepticism about the integration of coins into the existing financial system and cautioned that the legal foundation should be well established first.  ""Incorporating virtual currency into institutional finance may cause side effects such as recurring speculative fever and money laundering issues,"" the IT Chosun Ilbo quoted him as writing.  The local press interpreted the few and vague comments from the nominee as pointing toward a continuation of the policies and the maintenance of the stance of the Choi Jong-ku, the outgoing chairman. Choi was behind the ban on initial coin offerings (ICO), though he was also in favor of crypto exchanges holding bank accounts under certain strict conditions.  This half-in, half-out, go-slowly framework has put the industry in a difficult position, with only four exchanges having proper access to the banking system and most of the rest operating using untenable workarounds involving corporate accounts. While not strictly illegal, the loophole is against the spirit of the regulations and could be closed at any moment, putting an estimated 97 percent of the exchanges out of business.  The current regulatory environment has also driven many crypto projects outside the country and led to an active black market in offshore crypto within Korea.

42403216,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfGl8,1566992720,"They Biked, Ran and Swam Over 200 Miles Across Europe – All for Bitcoin","A group of bitcoin enthusiasts just ran, biked and swam across Europe, all to promote the cryptocurrency they believe is leaving a powerful, positive mark on the world.  The first ""Satoshi Freeathlon"" officially finished this weekend, in which a group of seven bitcoin enthusiasts flexing their athletic abilities by journeying from Switzerland's ""Crypto Valley"" in the tiny city of Zug, Switzerland, to Munich, Germany – a 221-mile adventure in total.  Running purely on bitcoin donations, the loose group dubbed ""Team Satoshi"" embarked on the quest in an attempt to raise positive awareness of bitcoin, which even 10 years after its release as open-source software, they believe gets too much negative press in the media.  The brainchild of Vitus Zeller, a German who started the project with a 10-day adventure of his own dubbed ""Tour de Satoshi,"" Zeller used bitcoin to pay for his hotel stays as he biked across the country.  He told CoinDesk:  ""In mainstream perception, bitcoin is mostly the money of the dark web [for buying drugs], an energy over-consuming technology or a purely speculative asset.""  Zeller's idea was to promote the values of bitcoin, including freedom of information and privacy, in a new way. ""Bitcoin needs all kinds of voices that make people get curious about it,"" he said.  Meanwhile, sports spark a more rosy image. ""Sports is a deeply emotional topic for humans. For thousands of years, sportsmen have been admired. Emperors in ancient times, as well as rulers in modern times, have been using sports for political reasons,"" Zeller contended.  'Monster lake' and beyond  Preparing for the ""freeathlon"" took quite a bit of time.  ""We have now together many hundreds of hours of intense training for this event. I, for example, ran about each week a half marathon,"" Zeller said, which is running a distance of 21 kilometers.  ""The preparation meant truly a lot of going above and beyond my own personal boundaries,"" he added.  But after months of training for each of the participants, they were ready for the journey. Three of the Team Satoshi crew (Zeller, as well as Moritz Biersack and Thomas Bette) slogged through all four days.  The rest of the group (including bitcoin podcast host Anita Posch, LocalBitcoins founder Jeremias Kangas, and Veronika Kuett) participated in one or more days of the event.  Day 2 was swimming across a Bodonsee, a lake where Austria, Switzerland and Germany meet, which Zeller repeatedly called a ""monster."" Measuring 12 kilometers in distance, it took the crew five hours to cross.  ""Crossing this monster lake [...] was a crazy experience. The waves, the streams and the fact that for the longest time we didn’t even see the other side until it cleared up,"" he said.  For this, it wasn't as simple as just doing the swim. Zeller said they ""needed a doctors note as well as a cold water certification to prove that we know what we are doing and can endure this large distance swim.""  Right across the lake, the team started Day 3 by cycling 190 kilometers (about 118 miles) from Friedrichshafen to Starnberg, cities in Germany.  ""With my 49 years of age the biggest challenge for me was keeping up with the young guys in the uphill sections. I think I managed that quite well, which is great,"" said Anita Posch, bitcoin podcast host and one of the Satoshi Team.  The last day was a marathon, running and sweating all the way to Munich. They hit the pub for a welcome celebration once they crossed the finish line.  Cypherpunk sports  Zeller's idea with all this is a bold one: to promote cypherpunk values, honoring those who were among the first to warn about how the internet could introduce new privacy concerns.  He refers specifically to ""A Cypherpunk's Manifesto"" as a sort of guiding force – a short essay written by Eric Hughes in 1993, just a couple of years before the internet, tackling the topic of privacy.  ""With Team Satoshi I had the idea to create a decentralized ...] marketing instrument for bitcoin and the values it represents (freedom of information, freedom of opinion, privacy, freedom of transaction and human rights) which derive from the Cypherpunk Manifesto,"" Zeller said.  It sounds like an odd idea to advocate for with sports, but Zeller makes a sincere argument for joining the two themes together.  ""Sports has been a powerful political tool to manipulate the people,"" he said, pointing to gladiators, who entertained Roman people with life-threatening fights. He even pointed to the Olympic games, which pits members of different nationalities against one another.  His idea is that anyone in the world can create their own Team Satoshi event: ""[Anyone] can create [sports] challenges on their own,"" he said, by updating the wiki website with the event.  As far-fetched as it sounds, Zeller wonders if this could morph into a profession someday: ""Team Satoshi members can even try to make this a profession all over the world, if they can find sponsors or people out of the ecosystem that support them.""  He added:  ""I believe Team Satoshi can potentially become a powerful movement as a soft marketing layer on top of bitcoin which connects bitcoin to the rest of the world and helps push it to mainstream adoption.""

42403217,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfGk9,1566986402,Bitcoin Price Above $10.1K As Momentum Stalls Near Key Indicator,"Views  Bitcoin's interaction with the 100-period moving average on the daily and weekly charts have provided strong regions of support in the past and may do so again.  Exhaustion caused by low levels of total daily volume and market activity raises doubts about the direction for the mid-term.  Should the bulls lose the on-going stalemate in buying and selling pressure, bitcoin risks falling to weekly supports located near $7,560 in the coming weeks.      Bitcoin's (BTC) price action continues to stall as the fight between buyers and sellers falls quiet near a key average line.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market value is experiencing stagnant market activity for the seventh straight day with the widely-followed 100-period moving average (MA) restricting the downside.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,140 on Bitstamp, representing little change on the day, having tested the 100-day MA at $10,047 earlier today. Exhaustion continues to play a part seen by low levels of total daily volume between Aug. 22 and Aug. 27, demonstrating minimal liquidity overall.  The last bastion of defense for the bulls in the mid-term rests along the 100-period moving average (MA), as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  Previously, BTC has reacted bullishly when interacting with the 100-period MA during an upward trending market (marked by a series of higher highs and higher lows), providing a strong region for a price bounce. That may yet prove fruitful should prices move above Aug. 26's close near $10,360.  While BTC remains officially bullish above the 100-period MA (located at $10,047), a firm close below that price level could revitalize bear market aspirations.  Should buyers lose the on-going struggle for dominance in the coming month, then that would expose weekly supports located near a region with historical significance and a confluence of the 100-weekly MA.  Weekly chart  The weekly chart demonstrates how the 100-period MA reacts with BTC's price by acting as a region of support during a strong uptrend.  For instance, on Jan. 11, 2016, BTC's price fell by 20 percent, pulling back to the 100-period MA before it took 28 days to recover and break to new highs. As stated, a loss by the bulls could expose the confluence of supports near June 10 lows and the 100-period MA at around $7,560.  Momentum would appear to be waning as the weekly awesome oscillator (AO), a trend-following indicator, begins to tick down toward the neutral line, backing the bearish outlook heading into next month.  However, a daily push and firm UTC close above $10,350 would question the bears to reconsider the short-term play and add credence to the theory of the 100-period MA acting as strong support during a bullish uptrend.

42403207,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfGbI,1566979232,Political Group Launches 'ICO' to Support US House Candidate,"A political action committee (PAC) wants to conduct an initial coin offering (ICO) to support candidates for public office.  ""BitPAC has its own funds but we’re also doing an initial coin offering,"" said Dan Backer, the group’s founder. ""Anyone who donates to [the PAC] as of [Friday] can get one politicoin.""  There’s no value associated with BitPAC’s politicoin, Backer explained, but the goal is to ultimately grant some sort of voting right to token holders. This is further “down the road,” he said.  Backer went on to say:  ""It’s a utility token, not a thing of value. I don’t care if people want to buy, sell trade their token, if an exchange wants to list it that’s [fantastic]. We have some larger scale, grand or long-term plans but we have to start [somewhere].""  BitPAC’s initial aim is to support a single candidate: Dan Bishop, a North Carolina state senator running for the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election.  Bishop is perhaps best known for sponsoring North Carolina’s controversial ""bathroom bill.""  However, Backer envisions a future platform where voters can show support for any candidate – both Republicans and Democrats – provided they’re registered with the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC).  ""I think it’s important we demonstrate there’s a level of political maturity here,"" he said, adding:  ""I think it’s going to be interesting to see. Win or lose, we’re going to learn a lot about this process.""  Second act  BitPAC was initially launched in 2014 as an entity looking to determine how political candidates could accept donations made in bitcoin.  At the time, it was unclear how bitcoin could be used for political donations, Backer said.  In 2014, BitPAC sent eight politicians paper wallets with bitcoin, hoping that the recipients would ask the FEC for clarity on how to report these donations.  The recipients included Senators Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), as well as Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and former Representatives Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.).  However, the recipients did not ask the FEC what to do with the wallets, and the PAC was terminated in 2018. Backer said he revived the PAC after realizing that it is still unclear how cryptocurrency donations can be reported.  ""Really on a whim I happened to look at one of the candidates,"" Backer said of his PAC’s revival, adding:  ""I looked at all of the candidates we gave the cryptocurrency to, not one reported, I think one reported but didn’t cash it.""  More than that, though, Backer says BitPAC is trying to support candidates who support the cryptocurrency space.  ""We target people based on what they care about, what motivates them,"" he explained. ""Our focus has always been smart politics.""  North Carolina's 9th  BitPAC is supporting Bishop in this year’s special election due to his past work supporting the industry, Backer said.  ""Bishop is demonstrably in support of crypto, so it’s worth getting behind him. We’re not going to have to guess where he is on the issue,"" he said.  Bishop supported a North Carolina bill updating its money transmitter law to better account for virtual currency businesses. Former Coinbase chief policy officer Mike Lempres thanked Bishop in a blog post applauding the passage of the bill.  Backer explained that Bishop’s past work in the crypto space was an opportunity to elect a ""pro-crypto"" Congressman.  ""If you want to support cryptocurrency, you’re not going to do it educating the electorate on cryptocurrency,"" he said. ""They care about what they care about.""  That being said, he doesn’t foresee BitPAC supporting any specific candidates in the future. He also said the PAC right now is not coordinating with Bishop’s campaign, though it is working to motivate ""mid-propensity voters"" to vote for him.  These are 6,000 Republican voters in North Carolina’s 9th district who typically would not turn out for a special election, Backer said, adding:  ""The outcome is voters get a candidate they like and want and we get a candidate who understands the importance of cryptocurrency and will be an advocate for cryptocurrency in Congress.""  After the election ends on Sept. 10, Backer will try to speak to Bishop, he said.  There is a prevailing irony, however: Voters can donate cash but anyone who wishes to donate cryptocurrency has to contact Backer or another member of his team to do so.  He says that’s due to FEC reporting requirements.  ""The issue is integrating the acceptance of cryptocurrency with FEC reporting requirements,"" he said of BitPAC’s primary goal. He could accept bitcoin, ether and a number of other cryptocurrencies, Backer said, ""as long as we’re able to identify the contributors and perform the compliance function with respect to FEC reporting requirements.""  According to FEC filings, BitPAC raised nearly $22,000 in the first half of 2019, on top of nearly $40,000 already in hand.

Lee  told CoinDesk the crypto bear market hurt the foundation's numbers much like other projects. Since 2017, Lee's donations have accounted for some 80 percent of the foundation's funding.  ""The goal, of course, is to get Litecoin Foundation to be self-sustaining from donations, partnerships and merchandise sales,"" Lee said. ""Until we get to that point, I have and will continue to support the Litecoin Foundation financially as necessary.""  Litecoin Foundation board director Xinxi Wang said donations dropped in the first quarter of 2019 because of the broader bear market. After Q2 audits are complete, Wang expects the foundation's donation numbers to rise.  “I don’t think there is a correlation between donations and enthusiasm,” Wang told Chinese news site XCong. “First, we did not actively solicit donations from the community in Q1. Second, the price of Litecoin was low, so the same amount of Litecoin donations were worth less than before. In Q2, we received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of donations.”  As XCong writes, foundation members took pay cuts in Q1 due to lower than expected funds.  Lee told CoinDesk that many employees volunteered for cuts in Q1 which is not atypical for Litecoin Foundation developers:  ""With that in mind, there have been a couple of instances where employees have asked that their salary be decreased during down markets in further support of the foundation.""  Lee said the foundation is running ahead with partnerships as well, such as one with the NFL's Miami Dolphins. Still, the mission remains on developing products for the Litecoin community.  One such project includes the development of Mimblewimble privacy tech on top of litecoin.  Speaking with CoinDesk, the CEO of Mimblewimble-based blockchain Beam, Alexander Zaidelson, said both teams maintain an open dialogue.  ""From the get-go, we offered help in building the solution, mostly related to architecture and design,"" Zaidelson told CoinDesk.  Litecoin also announced earlier this month that it is working with Grin developer David Burkett for further Mimblewimble development.

42403215,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfGjA,1566964837,"Bitcoin Teeters on $10K, But Can It Fend Off Another Bear?","Bitcoin’s recent market movements have thrown into contention consensus about its short-term price direction, with traders asking openly if demand is strong enough to fend off another bear market.  Such a question has emerged in the wake of the world's largest cryptocurrency's inability to set new highs above those seen in June and July, when optimism about a Facebook cryptocurrency launch pushed the price of bitcoin to $13,880 and $13,200 on June 26 and July 10, respectively.  Since then, bitcoin has largely failed to test these highs again, prompting speculation traders may be willing to push the market into a lower range, one that could be deepened by available futures options.  However, investors and analysts remain bullish based on the assumption that demand will continue its current course, helping to sustain prices around $10,000 until next year's May halving takes effect. Then, investors will see the amount of new bitcoin introduced to the market daily cut in half, with each new block in the blockchain producing 6.25 BTC, down from 12.5 BTC.  As can be seen by the recent litecoin halving, events that increase the perceived scarcity of cryptocurrencies have proven to catalyze buying interest.  Further, Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, an investment management firm focused on the asset class, argues that with the likes of Bakkt and Fidelity opening their doors to new money amid current global economic tensions, bitcoin looks attractive to large hedge fund managers seeking to offset risk in traditional markets.  Dorman told CoinDesk:  “Most macro hedge funds are contemplating using BTC as a better way to offset the systemic risks that are building globally. There seems to be too much interest and too much money on the sidelines for the market to really go lower in any meaningful way.”  Factoring Miner Demand  Analyzing the cryptocurrency markets remains an evolving science, but new metrics suggest that bitcoin may currently be priced favorably ahead of the halving event.  The Diffiulty Ribbon, created by influential market analyst Willy Woo, for example, was recently released. It helps illustrate how leading analysts believe miner selling pressure affects the price of bitcoin.  (As miners are believed to sell the BTC they receive from winning block rewards – to pay employees, electrical bills and other real-world costs – they are believed to influence market direction.)  The above chart shows bitcoin's ""network difficulty,"" a function of how hard the software makes it to discover a new block and thus claim the new cryptocurrency it releases to the market.  When the rate of network difficulty increases slows, analysts believe this is a sign miners are shutting off their hardware (leaving only the strong miners who proportionally need to sell fewer coins to remain operational). It's believed this leads to reduced sell pressure and more room for price increases.  The ribbon consists of simple moving averages of BTC network difficulty so the rate of change of difficulty can be easily seen. According to Woo, the best times to buy BTC are zones where the ribbon compresses.  He said:  “The timing of the last difficulty ribbon compression is very bullish, especially given we expect another compression at the halving, I don't think we have time to come into a bear season before then.”  Holding $10K  That said, less sophisticated investors may be using simple price charts to gauge entries.  The last two months have produced a series of lower highs putting a clamp to further growth. This can be observed in the amount of sell pressure bitcoin has seen when approaching upper resistances $10,800-$13,200.    Still, prices have held above $10,000 by the end of each daily closing period for nearly 30 days, suggesting that demand for bitcoin below that mark remains strong. As a result, some analysts believe BTC’s outlook would only change bias from bullish-to-bearish long-term should a firm close below $7,333 (200-day moving average) occur.  Still, the pressure is now mounting on the bulls to produce something significant in the short-term or else risk exposing lower supports at $9,600.  Whether or not short-term price action remains bearish, analysts agree that BTC is still bullishly bid based on its position above the aforementioned 200-daily moving average and current mining activity.  However, Dorman argues simple psychology may be the overriding factor so long as $10,000 remains a strong support and belief in the halving as a price catalyst remains strong.  He concluded:  “In general, across any asset class, when consensus is to buy lower... you rarely get that chance.”  Disclosure: This author holds no cryptocurrency at time of writing.

California-based Wyatt Pasek was sentenced to 17.5 years in prison for selling counterfeit opioid pills, while Arizona-based Kevin Dean McCoy, Silvester Ruelas, Amber Worrell and Peggy Gomez were sentenced to a variety of prison terms for selling heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine on dark web marketplaces. All of the defendants transacted with cryptocurrencies, according to court filings and press releases.  Pasek, also known as ""oxygod"" and ""Yung10x"" on online marketplaces, pleaded guilty last November for participating in a drug-trafficking conspiracy, money laundering and illegal possession of a firearm, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California. As part of a plea agreement, Pasek will turn over $21,000 in cash, a ""gold and diamond bitcoin necklace,"" a diamond-studded watch, two gold bars and ""thousands of dollars"" in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held in a Blockchain wallet.  In addition, McCoy, Ruelas, Worrell and Gomez pleaded guilty to money laundering charges; according to a press release, they used peer-to-peer exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies as part of this effort.  Authorities seized gold, silver and platinum bars, as well as a Seattle Seahawks Super Bowl ring, an AK-47 (built by Texas Weapons System), a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun and a .50 caliber sniper rifle, Monday's release, by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona explained.  The Arizona defendants sold drugs using AlphaBay, Hansa and Dream Market, which all allowed for transactions conducted using cryptocurrencies (AlphaBay and Hansa were shut down in 2017, while Dream Market shuttered its virtual doors earlier this year).  In a statement, Drug Enforcement Administration special agent Doug Coleman said ""Drug traffickers using the dark web feel a sense of security with the anonymity to sell their poisons throughout the world,"" adding:  ""This investigation clearly demonstrates they aren’t safe, they aren’t anonymous, and they can’t evade justice.""  Monday's sentences come days after the White House published a number of advisory notes stating that cryptocurrencies – including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and monero – are being used for illicit drug transactions. The advisories include instructions on how to track payments using wallet and IP addresses, as well as transaction hashes.  The advisories were published simultaneously with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control's announcement that three Chinese citizens were being added to the Specially Designated Nationals list for shipping synthetic opioids to the U.S. Nearly a dozen bitcoin (and one litecoin) addresses were included on the blacklist.
