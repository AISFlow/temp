42399384,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj233,1475872250,The US Federal Reserve is ‘Paying Close Attention’ to Blockchain,"Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard delivered a speech on blockchain today, remarking that the technology could have a major impact on the financial system.  Brainard's speech  , delivered to at the Institute of International Finance in Washington, D.C., represents what may be the US central bank’s strongest words on blockchain to date. She detailed developments from a Federal Reserve-guided working group that is focused on financial innovation, an effort that, in part, is looking at the question of using the tech in next-generation payment and settlement systems.  At the same time, Brainard echoed past comments from other Fed officials regarding its watch-and-research approach, telling attendees:  “We are paying close attention to distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, recognizing this may represent the most significant development in many years in payments, clearing, and settlement.”  Brainard’s comments come just over a week after Fed chair Janet Yellen, appearing before a US House of Representatives panel, remarked that the technology could have a “significant impact” on the financial system. At the time, she said that the central bank was “trying to understand” digital currencies and other blockchain applications.  Brainard’s speech explored various use cases of the technology in finance, as well as touching on what the Fed sees as potential risks that could result from broadening adoption.  “Like many new financial technologies, distributed ledgers could ameliorate or exacerbate traditional financial risks,” she said.  Brainard went on to say that the Fed would publish a research paper on the subject of blockchain later this year. Further, she indicated that the central bank would continue to meet and discuss the technology with both private and public sector stakeholders.

42399388,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj215,1475863782,Blockchain Healthcare Conference Showcases Skepticism and Promise,"""It’s all possible with blockchain…""  You hear this over and over at industry conferences. But this time, at the Distributed: Health conference in Nashville, this pie-in the-sky statement got a bit more pushback than usual.  According to many of the speakers at the on 3rd October show, blockchain tech stands to disrupt the complex and frustrating healthcare system in a positive way, mostly revolving around simplifying the management and transfer of health records and information.  Chris Kay, senior vice president and chief innovation officer at Humana, said during the morning keynote address:  ""There’s a potential for blockchain and its enabling capabilities to solve core problems in healthcare. Healthcare is at a tipping point.""  In his mind, a blockchain — which provides trust without a central authority, security and data transparency — could marry the disparate processes in healthcare. For example, a blockchain-based health care system might provide insight into the variety of medical issues a person might be suffering from and integrate health care with the social care of family and friends.  While the biggest issues to fix remain outside the scope of blockchain – think the difficulty in choosing fresh, healthy food over McDonald’s – Kay believes busting down the silos in healthcare could be the beginning stages of a healthcare revolution.  Data needs to flow between primary health care providers, specialists and holistic medicine practitioners that a patient is using. In that way, people could get better, more targeted recommendations on what they can do to better their health.  While Kay was optimistic about blockchain’s impact on the healthcare industry, when it came to the breakout sessions, both panelists and the audience seemed more skeptical.  ""Any IT person from a health organization should come in with a healthy level of skepticism,"" said Andrew Beal, blockchain and distributed infrastructure lead at Ernst & Young (EY), adding:  ""The tech is immature. Everything is in the proof of concept stage with dummy data and a couple partners.""  What the industry really needs  The idea that the market is too immature for production-ready services was supported by Wayne Vaughan, founder and CEO of Tierion, a global platform for verifying data, during a panel discussion.  ""I would caution that nothing is production-ready right now,"" he said.  That position was contested by Ted Tanner, co-founder and chief technology officer at PokitDok, a blockchain-based company focused on the healthcare industry. Tanner suggested that PokitDok’s proof-of-stake private blockchain is ready for production today.  ""We have very large companies using our APIs. It’s just a matter of switching out the underlying infrastructure,"" Tanner said.  But the goal, according to Jeff Cunningham, another panelist and chief technology officer of health IT company Informatics Corporation of America (ICA), is more about updating existing infrastructure than ripping it up and replacing it.  Even for an industry where settling times for claims can extend more than 180 days and health payers spent $375b sending out paper claims, ""if there’s a better way, the costs of re-architecting are so high it doesn’t happen"", he said.  Healthcare today is largely a system of barriers. The industry itself is highly regulated, much like financial services. And this adds significant hurdles for any startup trying to enter the space.  Plus the federal government, through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS) is the single largest payer of healthcare in America, so public/private entity partnerships are going to be a must.  ""From a positive aspect, many of the challenges that exist in healthcare today are around complex distributed processes; it’s how the industry has grown up, all siloed,"" said Cunningham. ""But if you start to rethink how healthcare should look as a more complex, team-based healthcare plus finance and payment with the care, the blockchain could be the fabric to ties that together.""  The focus should be on how physicians, not patients, interact with the system, he said.  ""For the most part to make progress in healthcare today … at least on the care side, it’s [about] how you interact with the provider,"" Cunningham said. ""Provider interaction will be about interacting with those physicians and how they are interacting with the technology.""  Security as a innovation motivator  Data security, from what event attendees and panelists had to say, seems to be the big driver in the push for the healthcare industry to adopt blockchain technology.  ""Ninety percent of companies in this space have been affected by a data breach,"" said Micah Winkelspecht, founder and CEO of Gem during an afternoon keynote. With a distributed network, there will not be a single point of failure for fraudsters to try and hack into anymore, he contended.  Others are skeptical as to whether blockchain would actually solve that problem.  Several people voiced concern that blockchain merely shifts the security problem. Because blockchains are not good data stores, not all health information could be stored on it. Instead most startups think a digital identity that points to health records somewhere else is what will be housed on a blockchain.  Yet that brings in the existing issue with third party providers housing large data sets on centralized servers.  According to Andrew Keys, head of global business development at ConsenSys, the industry will fall back on traditional security mechanisms, like two-factor authentication and multi-signature transactions to shore up these gaps.  ""You could have a perfect blockchain identity system but it depends how people on the outside decide to store and use the information,"" said Tierion’s Vaughan. ""The network is a source of information but it doesn’t mean others won’t save it. Blockchain doesn’t mean the end of data silos.""  Plus, large health IT providers aren’t going to want a shared infrastructure for archiving because it’ll be costly to maintain, Vaughan added.  Controlling medical spend  And according to nearly everyone at the conference, including Winkelspecht, healthcare spending is already out of control.  Healthcare spending in the US totals more than $2tn annually, representing one-seventh of the economy. By 2017, as reported by CMS, healthcare spending will grow to $4tn annually.  Many times, more than 300 people touch a single medical claim, he said, which only decreases security and costs stakeholders significant amounts of money. The healthcare industry spends about $10,000 per citizen every year, and spending is predicted to increase by 5.8% next year, he continued.  ""Yet we still haven’t fixed the problem. You have a one in five chance of re-entering a hospital within 30 days,"" Winkelspecht said. ""So the industry is spending on new technology but not making the care any better.""  These all add up to a frustrating system that is in dire need of reworking. And while questions arose about how the industry might use blockchain to get there, many people remained optimistic.  Beal, who’s bullish on blockchain technology, said that within finance, blockchain started a conversation that led banks and payment providers to work on upgrading their systems. It’ll at least be the same in healthcare, he argued.  ""If the only benefit … is that it forces IT professionals at hospitals and payers to look at their tech stack and areas they could update it, that’ll be enough,"" Beal said.

42399393,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj27y,1475853433,Brave Offers First Bitcoin Micropayments to Publishers,"Browser software startup Brave has some bitcoin it would like to give to The Wall Street Journal.  The controversial browser that blocks third-party ads, also gives users the ability to offset lost ad revenue in the form of bitcoin micropayments reconciled at the end of each month.  The first of these reconciliation cycles ended last week and Brave has now published a step-by-step process explaining how website owners can claim their bitcoin.  ""The Wall Street Journal is number one,"" said Brave co-founder Brenden Eich during a conversation with CoinDesk earlier this week.  Eich added:  ""Those funds are piling up. We have an accounting system that says you voted for this publisher this many times and that website you liked.""  CoinDesk can independently verify that The Wall Street Journal tops the list, but Brave is not sharing how much bitcoin the publication can collect, or which other sites qualify.  In total, about 8,000 Brave users visited 827 websites over the month-long period ending Friday.  Users can select if some of the sites they visit frequently don’t get paid and control the percentage of a set monthly amount to be allocated to each site.  To collect that bitcoin an interested party first needs to verify he or she owns the website by pasting code securely provided by the Brave into its own website, similar to the challenge-response protocol employed by Let's Encrypt, said Eich.  ""Now it’s time to start talking to publishers,"" added Eich.  Partners or competitors?  The newly launched webpage that walks publishers through the process of creating a wallet and receiving funds is part of a larger push to change the way publishers view Brave.  Shortly before the San Francisco-base firm raised $4.5 million, it received an informal cease-and-desist letter from the Newspaper Association of America, which has rebranded as the News Media Alliance.  With this latest release, Brave is seeking to position itself with those publishers as a replacement for revenue that is already being lost by people who use other ad-blocking services, not a new way to muscle in on the publishers’ advertising dollars.  But Paul Boyle, vice president of News Media Alliance, remains skeptical.  After a meeting he had with Eich and other publishers in May, Boyle told CoinDesk he thinks there are other ways for the industry to respond to customer demands for better, more private forms of ads.  ""We don’t see where a process of blocking ads and then replacing it with a minimal amount of bitcoin users spread across many users will provide the meaningful revenue we receive today,"" he said.  Olive branch  To coincide with the completion of the first reconciliation cycle, Eich is currently visiting New York City, where he’ll meet with several publishers, including Dow Jones, which publishes the Journal.  So far, only a ""handful"" of publishers have signed up, according to Eich, who has also met with this publication.  He concluded:  ""We’re trying to get CoinDesk to be one of the first.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Brave.

42399377,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj1wA,1475840577,What's Left Before SegWit Goes Live,"Bitcoin's global development community is scheduled to meet this week for the latest edition of a conference series focused on the network's more pressing problems, like scaling to accommodate more transactions.  Launched in 2015 in response to mounting demand for scaling to support a larger userbase, this weekend's Scaling Bitcoin is slated to see a number of talks focused on issues like scalability, as well as one on Segregated Witness (SegWit), a much-lauded and debated scaling compromise announced in December.  While no big updates are expected at the conference, bitcoin developers say the release of activation code that would see SegWit disseminated for download and testing is expected soon, representing another step in a long line that has preceded its expected launch.  Before officially making the change, however, developers are still testing for potential bugs.  ""We’re making a lot of changes to the network right now,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo said, arguing that they need to tread carefully to ensure that the update is compatible with other recent changes (as seen in the latest software release).  ""One of the remaining open issues is making SegWit work with compact blocks,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop added. Integrated in August, compact blocks allow nodes to send data more quickly and efficiently when they ""talk"" to one another.  Despite the wait, there's reason for excitement. The code, when launched, is expected to nearly double the number of transactions bitcoin can process and perhaps bring some resolution to what has been a long and contentious debate over bitcoin scaling.  Not only does it immediately grow the amount of transactions that the network can process, but it also lays the groundwork for future projects that could potentially expand capacity further.  SegWit provides a fix to the ""transaction malleability"" problem, which is necessary for top-level networks like Lightning Network to be deployed.  So, what else is left before this much-anticipated scaling code goes live?  Activating the change  The last software upgrade, released in August, was the first to feature the SegWit code, but it didn't include the code needed to activate the change on the network.  The next update 0.13.1, Core developers say, will allow the code to be downloaded. From there, bitcoin miners can begin upgrading their software as a way to signal that they support the change.  As explained by the Bitcoin Core website, the code will ""lock-in"" the change once 95% of the last 2,016 blocks (roughly two weeks worth of transactions) are broadcast by those running the new code.  Roughly two weeks after that (after another 2,016 blocks), SegWit will officially be activated.  ""That means all full nodes running SegWit-aware code will begin requiring miners to enforce the new SegWit consensus rules,"" Core explained in a recent blog post.  Lombrozo said that core developers hope that the process will unfold ""pretty quickly,"" mentioning that it took about 2 to 3 months for another big bitcoin update, checksequenceverify, to activate.  Spreading through the ecosystem  From there, the change will ripple out to the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem.  The more consumer-facing bitcoin world has already begun to prepare for the changes, with different wallet providers moving to upgrade for compatibility. Core developers say they are actively working with these businesses to ensure a smooth transition.  But wallet providers won't need to actually make the shift until SegWit is activated. This state of affairs has resulted in what BitGo platform lead Benedict Chan called a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem.  Chan estimated it would take about five ""man weeks"" of developer time to make the upgrade.  ""Not a huge amount, but not a small amount,"" he said. ""We'd probably only prioritize that when we hear the activation date announced.""  Bitcoin Core developers are advising that users should even wait a few weeks after activation to upgrade. This, they say, is in order to guard against the possibility that a significant majority of the network isn't in agreement over the new rules.  Lombrozo argued that it's a flexible process, since wallets can wait until they're comfortable to make the upgrade, although if they wait, they won't be able to take advantage of the increased block space.  Hearts and minds  Still, there are some who believe such upgrades aren't worth the ""politics"" that accompany the changes.  Jonathan Toomim, who runs a hosted bitcoin mining operation and advocated for larger blocks at the last Scaling Bitcoin, said he remains unconvinced that the performance changes will be enough to revive user interest in bitcoin.  When asked if anything would change his mind about the performance of SegWit, Toomim, an organizer for the Bitcoin Classic project, was dour about the prospects, indicating he is now more excited about the potential of other blockchain platforms like ethereum and Zcash.  Any campaign to win hearts and minds, Toomim said, is likely to leave his opinion unchanged.  ""[SegWit] has cost bitcoin in terms of restricted growth, lost developer time and lost market share to altcoins,"" he said, adding:  ""I think it provides too little scaling, too late.""  Whether others will feel similarly, remains to be seen.

42399392,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbj26z,1475801036,Nasdaq Wants to Patent Blockchain Backups for Exchanges,"Nasdaq is looking to patent a method by which a blockchain could be used to secure records of exchange transactions.  On 6th October, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USTPO) released an application for ""systems and methods of blockchain transaction recordation"", originally submitted by Nasdaq on 31st March. It is attributed to Tom Fay, Nasdaq’s senior vice president of enterprise architecture, and Dominick Paniscotti, associate vice president for enterprise architecture.  Essentially, the application details an exchange system comprising digital wallets, an order book and matching engine, with a ""closed blockchain"" utilized as a record of transactions that is updated in real-time.  As the application details:  “A match is identified between data transaction requests and hashes associated with the digital wallets associated with the respective data transaction requests are generated. The counterparties receive the hashes of the other party along with information on the match and each party causes blockchain transactions to be added to the blockchain of the blockchain computing system.”  From there, the exchange checks the contents of the blockchain, looking for the data associated with those digital wallets. An additional backup of that information is also kept in a separate database.  While new, it's perhaps unsurprising that Nasdaq would move to file applications related to the technology. Last year, the exchange operator unveiled Linq, a blockchain project focused on private markets, and in May, it launched new blockchain services for its global client base.  The application's contents reveal that the company is largely looking to apply claims to the method of using a blockchain in an exchange environment, rather than the system itself. USTPO records show that Nasdaq originally sought a number of claims related to the tech, but that these were cancelled after the application was first filed in March.  The full application can be found here.
