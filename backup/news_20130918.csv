42397229,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Eo,1379528519,Centralway Ventures invests $250k in bitcoin startup Buttercoin,"Company builder Centralway is investing $250,000 in bitcoin startup Buttercoin via its new early-stage investment arm Centralway Ventures.  The company, which is set to be headquartered in Somerset House in London, will invest $50m each year in around 20 or 30 startup firms at the seed or early stage plus in bigger Series A funding rounds, TechCrunch reports.  It said its preference will be to invest in companies early on and then continue investing in the same businesses as they grow.  Buttercoin, which was founded earlier this year, is the first company Centralway Ventures is investing in. The company is building a white-labelled federation of bitcoin exchanges around the world.  ""Our partners from any country can start their own branded bitcoin exchange which will be fast, secure, compliant, highly liquid, and easy to launch,"" a Buttercoin spokesperson said.  The company makes money not by charging its partners any upfront or monthly fees, but by splitting the net income of the transaction fees.  Cedric Dahl, the company's CEO, told CoinDesk his experience with Centralway has been a ""dream"". He said:  ""We're big fans of the Centralway approach. There are two types of investors: there are people who lead the pack and people who follow – Centralway is totally a leader in how forward-thinking it is.""  Centralway approached Buttercoin having done its homework – it already knew a lot about Buttercoin and had a number of strategic partnerships lined up.  ""This is the way that venture capital will become, because it will have to. All the best startups will only work with the companies that make life easy for them,"" Dahl said.  The entrepreneur said the money is primarily being used to hire and pay the salaries of two ""super"" developers. ""We're really very focused on building an exceptional developer pipeline,"" he added.  Buttercoin has already been working on forging partnerships in the US, Brazil and Hong Kong and has now turned its attention to Mexico and India.  ""On the India front, we have maybe a dozen prospects that we're considering and going through diligence with now. The key thing is to not just work with people who are willing to work with us, but those who are also able to work with us,"" Dahl explained.  He said the company is currently in the fortunate but tricky situation of having more demand than it can satisfy, so he and his colleagues need to be careful in their choice of partners.  This isn't the only funding Buttercoin has received recently – just last month the company raised $1m from a number of investors including Google Ventures, Y Combinator and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.  Dahl said the past few months has ""sort of been a blur"" but he is now looking forward to continuing to work with Centralway Ventures to expand Buttercoin's global reach, hinting there could already be deals on the horizon in Germany.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/18/centralway-ventures-invests-250k-in-bitcoin-startup-buttercoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9779f73e5ede51c99c4e468c352fffb63bf9c652-1024x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397246,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1UY,1379523754,Online game developer Bigpoint's 330m users can now buy virtual goods with bitcoins,"German online game developer Bigpoint now allows users to purchase in-game virtual goods using bitcoins.  The company, which was founded in 2002 and now has over 330 million users, was one of the first companies to introduce the free-to-play model in online gaming in Europe. This means users don't have to pay a subscription fee to play browser-based games; payment is only necessary when the players want to buy virtual items that will help them progress faster.  ""When you think about it, since our business revolves around virtual goods, it makes sense for us to implement the most popular virtual currency as a payment method,"" said Khaled Helioui, CEO of Bigpoint.  He went on to explain that the company already had a large payment system in place, which accepted money from a number of third-party payment providers across the world. ""Actually, to date, we have over 220 payment services integrated in our API and we are always on the lookout to find relevant and interesting payment methods for our users.""  The company decided to use BitPay as its bitcoin payment processor so it could reach even more people. BitPay, which recently announced it has over 10,000 merchants in its network, supports over 30 currencies, which Helioui enthuses is more than PayPal supports.  Gut feeling  Bigpoint is available in over 150 countries (and over 30 languages), but the company decided to initially launch the bitcoin payment method in Germany and the US. This test period obviously proved a success as bitcoin is now accepted across all the company's games and most of the countries it covers.  ""Usually we have a gut feeling about how a new feature or offering is going to go, but this is so special and so unique that honestly, we don't know what's going to happen,"" Helioui said.  He thinks bitcoin has a lot of potential on Bigpoint as many of its users are tech-savvy young adults who don't have credit cards and are already interested in digital currency.  In fact, Helioui believes so much in the potential of bitcoin that he's giving those who pay in the digital currency a 5% bonus (they get 5% more virtual goods than they would if they paid with other payment methods). ""We're not only waiting for people to use bitcoins, we are actively encouraging them to because we believe it will help to drive our business forward.""  Cost savings  While bitcoin will enable more people to play Bigpoint's games, it also benefits the company in another way – by cutting costs.  Payment processing fees for traditional currencies vary greatly from one country to the next, but Helioui asserts they are all ""obscene"" compared with the cost of accepting payment in bitcoin (BitPay's payment processing fees start from 0.99%).  He explained that integrating the bitcoin payment system was ""surprisingly easy and frictionless"" and said he can't see any downsides for Bigpoint or its users.  ""I'd rather have our players use bitcoin in the virtual worlds we create than local currency. It removes a lot of hassle – both for us and them.""  The future  Helioui revealed the company is currently working hard with HBO on creating the Game of Thrones game and expects it to launch at some point next year.  He said that, considering how popular Game of Thrones is, Bigpoint really wants to take time creating the game and make sure it reaches the expectations of the show's fans. He added:  ""Hopefully by the time the Game of Throne game launches, we can say a decent percentage of our users' payments are being made in bitcoins.""  Marco Santori, chair of the Bitcoin Foundation's regulatory affairs committee, suggested the online gaming industry is an area in which bitcoin could really flourish. ""As bitcoins gain adoption in the mainstream, developments like this remind us how well suited bitcoin is for the virtual economy.""  He said he couldn't see any real reason why any other form of currency or method of payment would be better suited than bitcoin for this particular purpose.  From a legal perspective, Santori said Bigpoint is unlikely to face any legal consequences in any of the countries that have addressed the ""bitcoin question"" so far, such as the UK, Germany, Canada and the US.  ""Certainly in the US, there are almost no legal consequences. Under the March FinCEN guidance, Bigpoint are users of virtual currency and so there are no money transmission obligations on their part,"" he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/09/18/online-game-developer-bigpoints-330m-users-can-now-buy-virtual-goods-with-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/026ed1f71f245ad9fc49ae1d40137a90b7fc4083-800x557.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397230,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAao1Fn,1379503418,Bitcoin Foundation presses for bitcoin campaign contributions,"The Bitcoin Foundation has sent a letter to the US Federal Election Commission, supporting calls for bitcoin campaign contributions to be officially allowed.  The letter broadly supports a letter issued by the Conservative Action Fund PAC (CAF) earlier this month. The foundation calls for bitcoin-based contributions to be allowed, and points to FinCEN’s 18th March guidance on virtual currencies as evidence that the government is already recognizing the currency as having an equivalent value in ‘real’ currency.  The foundation’s letter argues that Internet-based payments are already an accepted source of campaign contributions. Even SMS payments are currently permitted following a decision by the commission a year ago, the letter points out, arguing that methods have been devised to ensure that payments are not taken from unauthorized sources.  A screening technique proposed by CAF would require contributors paying via credit card to give their full name and address. The letter said:  “The collection of bitcoin contributions is no different in this regard than the collection of contributions online or by text message.""  Bitcoin shouldn’t be automatically classified as an in-kind or mandatory payment, argues the letter, suggesting that it has characteristics of both. The Federal Election Campaign Act requires money to be deposited into a political action campaign’s bank account within ten days, whereas in-kind payments may be held in their current form for longer.  But there is a more significant reason underlying the foundation’s wish to have bitcoin donations to be permitted as in-kind payments, and that relates to the technological characteristics of the protocol. It can be used both as a currency, and as a record of ownership, said Marco Santori, the Bitcoin Foundation’s regulatory affairs committee chair.  “Colored coins are a good example of this. If CAF got a donation in the form of a bitcoin, that could be worth $120 on Mt. Gox, or it could be a colored coin that signifies the ownership of a thousand shares in a company, that could be worth thousands or millions,” he said. “We’re not seeing a lot of colored coin activity – there’s not a lot of smart property. But there are foundation members working now on enabling that technology.”  Some politicians are already accepting bitcoin contributions to their campaigns in what appears to be an ‘act first, and ask forgiveness later’ stance. Mark Warden, state representative for New Hampshire, did not respond to CoinDesk’s questions about the amount that he has raised in bitcoins since he began accepting them. Neither did the US Libertarian Party, which is also now accepting contributions this way.  One barrier to political contributions in bitcoin could be the lack of a recurring payment mechanism in the protocol. The Libertarian Party raises the issue on its website, and directs people to simply make manual payments as often as they wish.  Another issue will be the potential for anonymous use of bitcoin. The foundation highlights the network’s transparency, saying:  “The fact of, time of, and amount of each and every transaction from one public key to another occurring in the bitcoin network is automatically recorded in the public block chain, and this record is maintained indefinitely.""  Santori added that IP addresses used to make bitcoin payments could be traced.  In truth, these things can easily be spoofed. Proxies can be used, and payments can be made anonymous using online bitcoin mixing services. This means, in theory, that an organization could exceed the current limits on contributions simply by making payments from a variety of suitably obfuscated addresses.  “The fact that bitcoin addresses can be manipulated isn’t really relevant,” protested a spokesperson for the foundation. “The FEC has permitted donation recipients to rely on the truthfulness of the information provided by other donors, and there is no reason for it not to do so for donors wishing to contribute in bitcoin.”  We can expect an advisory opinion by the Federal Election Commission on this issue by 28th October.
