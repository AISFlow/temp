At a recent press conference hosted by the Swiss Bankers Association, SNB’s chief economist, Carlos Lenz, announced there is no need for a digital franc because the current payment system works well without one. Lenz also criticized blockchain technology, calling it “very inefficient.” “I don’t think a decentralized solution is ideal,” he said.      Switzerland has been researching central bank digital currencies since at least 2019, when the Swiss parliament asked the government to examine the potential of creating a CBDC. In December 2019, the government concluded that a digital franc would be too risky. The country has created a friendly environment for blockchain startups with the Zug Valley among the world’s hotbeds of innovation. Diem, the Facebook-backed stablecoin project formerly known as Libra, is also based in Switzerland.      Despite the Swiss government’s negative stance on central bank digital currencies, Swiss CBDC research has continued. In 2020, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) wrapped a trial testing the feasibility of a CBDC used among financial institutions, and earlier this month the SNB and the Bank of France started a cross-border bank-to-bank CBDC experiment called “Project Jura.”      But during the press comments, Lenz emphasized that these studies are just that – studies, not implementations.      “This is not about implementation on a productive level,” Lenz stated. “There are currently no plans to introduce digital bank money. This also applies to the wholesale area.”      Lenz compared the ongoing scramble to develop a CBDC to the fear that many in Switzerland felt when the euro was introduced.      “We had such discussions when the euro was introduced,” Lenz said. “There was also fear that payments would suddenly be made in euros.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/26/swiss-national-bank-has-no-plans-for-a-digital-currency-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de268c53336acda843651972622bcfec163b86e4-1500x843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

2804459,https://eng.ambcrypto.com/?p=77216,1624708468,Who will have the final say on Litecoin's price over the next few weeks?,"Disclaimer: The findings of the following article are the sole opinions of the writer and should not be taken as investment advice Litecoin registered a decline of 8% on the back of a broader market sell-off. The altcoin's price broke below the strong support level of $140 and was about to test the 19 May swing low of $116, at the time of writing. While reactionary buying could alleviate some of LTC's recent losses, the threat of a sharper decline loomed large over the coming week. Litecoin Daily Chart Source: LTC/USD , TradingView A descending channel breakdown saw LTC register losses of 22% as the alt's price moved towards the demand zone between $116-$140. In fact, LTC has largely oscillated between these two points since 21 June as buyers have been able to match up to the selling pressure. However, the candlesticks were below their 20, 50, and 200 SMAs and without their support, LTC is always vulnerable to an extended downtrend. Reasoning The OBV has declined steadily since 17 April, even during times when LTC was snapping fresher local highs. This divergence hinted at a pullback even prior to the wider crypto sell-off. The index continued its southbound descent at press time as selling volume outmatched buying volume. Weakness was also evident on the Relative Strength Index since it has failed to move above 50 for over a month now. A move into the oversold zone does warrant a reversal, one that could push LTC back towards its 20-SMA (red) and $156 over the coming days, but gains would be short-lived in a market that is largely dominated by sellers. While the MACD did attempt to recover above equilibrium, momentum fizzled out as sellers regained control. Furthermore, a death cross can be seen approaching as the 50-SMA inched closer to the 200-SMA, and bearish sentiment would likely accentuate losses. A close below its 22 June swing low of $104 could trigger a steady downfall of 40% towards its late-December levels of $66. Interestingly, the Visible Range's point on control also lay around this mark. Conclusion Litecoin's demand zone of $116-$140 could trigger a minor comeback in the market, but bears would dictate its movement over the coming week.

Rosengren included the stablecoin among what he termed ""new disruptors"" to short-term credit markets.      In an interview with Yahoo Finance the same day, he elaborated.      ""The reason I talked about Tether and stablecoins is if you look at their portfolio, it basically looks like a portfolio of a prime money market fund but maybe riskier,"" he said. Tether ""has a number of assets that, during the pandemic, the spread got quite wide on those assets."" Spread widening refers to a sell-off in the credit markets, when the difference in yield increases between a risky asset such as a corporate bond and one perceived as safe like a Treasury bond.      ""I do think we need to think more broadly about what could disrupt short-term credit markets over time, and certainly stablecoins are one element,"" Rosengren said. ""I do worry that the stablecoin market that is currently, pretty much unregulated as it grows and becomes a more important sector of our economy, that we need to take seriously what happens when people run from these type of instruments very quickly.""

""What’s interesting is [Fed governor Lael] Brainard and then [Chairman Jerome] Powell started talking 'stablecoins.' But now Rosengren talks 'tether' by name. That’s an escalation,"" said Long, the founder and CEO of Avanti Financial in Wyoming.      ""The Fed is so practiced, ... at 'Fedspeak' – such carefully constructed statements so that multiple sides of an issue can see their side in what the Fed said,"" she said. ""That was basically the [case with] previous statements about stablecoins. But today the Fed escalated. Rarely are they so explicit like they were today.""      Long added that bitcoiners who consider concerns about Tether overblown should not ""shoot the messenger.""      ""I've both defended Tether as breakthrough technology while also calling out that its reserve disclosure opened more questions than it answered,"" she said, referring to the company's breakdown of the collateral behind USDT, released in May.

(Stu Hoegner, Tether's general counsel, later wrote that ""the vast majority"" of this commercial paper is from issuers rated A-2 or higher, without naming any.)      Rosengren included the composition in another slide from his presentation at a virtual event organized by the Philadelphia Fed.      USDT plays a key role in the plumbing of the $1 trillion global cryptocurrency market. Traders use it, and to a lesser degree other stablecoins, to quickly move dollar value between exchanges in order to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities.      Read more: A Bridge Called Tether      Stablecoins are designed to trade at par with fiat currencies such as the dollar, and in theory are redeemable 1-for-1 for cash from the issuers. But questions about Tether's backing have loomed over the crypto market for years and were the focus of a probe by the New York Attorney General's Office that the company settled this year.      Despite the long-simmering doubts and conjecture about Tether's finances, USDT has traded at $1 for almost all of its history, as it did Saturday morning UTC.      USDT also remains by far the largest stablecoin by market capitalization despite the emergence of competitors with less controversial histories.

There, Tether Is King      A discussion paper outlining the Fed's thinking on digital payments, including the risks and benefits of central bank digital currencies (CBDC), will come out this summer, Powell said last month in the same speech where he referred briefly to stablecoins without mentioning any by name.      Paolo Ardoino, Tether's CTO, said that while Rosengren's comments are a tribute to the growth of importance of stablecoins and other innovations in crypto, it's important to distinguish between established stablecoins like Tether and ""extremely risky"" experiments like algorithmic stablecoins going on in decentralized finance.      ""It is remarkable that the growing market share of such new financial innovations is being recognized by the likes of the Boston Fed,"" Ardoino said. ""However, it is also an important moment to educate consumers about the difference between stablecoins such as Tether and the various experiments that are constantly taking place in decentralized finance. It is always recommended that investors spend time researching these projects. Opportunities with outsized APYs are extremely risky. Nascent monetary experiments such as algorithmic stablecoins should not be classified in the same category as USDT. Doing so only demonstrates a lack of understanding on the ground floor of the cryptocurrency financial system.""      Interestingly, Rosengren signaled that the Fed has been paying attention to lesser-known stablecoins as well.      ""We actually had a stablecoin that ran into financial difficulties last week,"" he said in the Yahoo interview, an apparent reference to Iron Finance's TITAN token, which fell almost to zero in mid-June.
