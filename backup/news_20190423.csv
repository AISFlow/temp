42402855,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddCBo,1556046602,French Lender Societe Generale Issues $112 Million Bond on Ethereum,"UPDATE (April 23, 20:45 UTC): This article has been updated to note that Societe Generale issued the bonds to itself, and to include other details from a rating agency report.    ---------    French financial services giant Societe Generale Group has issued about $112 million worth of bonds in the form of a security token on the public ethereum blockchain.  Announced  today, a subsidiary called Societe Generale SFH used the OFH token (obligations de financement de l’habitat, or home financing obligations) to represent 100 million euros of covered bonds, a type of security that is backed by specific assets but remains on the issuer's balance sheet.  However, according to a report published Tuesday by bond rating agency Moody's Investors Service, Societe Generale was ""the sole investor,"" meaning the firm issued the securities to itself and no outside buyers were involved.  The bond has a five-year maturity with a 12-month extension period, Moody's said. It is pari passu (""on equal footing"") with other covered bonds of the issuer, meaning if the company were to fail, whoever held the tokens at that time would be repaid the same fractional amounts at the same time as regular bondholders, the report said.  The rating agency said it considers the use of blockchain technology ""credit positive"" for the issuer, in part because of increased transparency and a reduced likelihood of errors ""arising from the complexity and the number of intermediaries involved in issuing covered bonds using traditional means.""  The pilot was designed by Societe Generale's blockchain subsidiary Societe Generale FORGE, ""one of the 60 internal startups launched via the Internal Startup Call, the Group’s intrapreneurial programme,"" the company said.  Big Four professional-services firm PwC advised the project on the technology and the French law firm Gide Loyrette Nouel was a legal advisor, SocGen said.  ""This live transaction explores a more efficient process for bond issuances,"" the firm said in a press release, adding:  ""Many areas of added value are predicted, among which, product scalability and reduced time to market, computer code automation structuring, thus better transparency, faster transferability and settlement. It proposes a new standard for issuances and secondary market bond trading and reduces cost and the number of intermediaries.""  Past experiments  Societe Generale has been involved in a number of enterprise blockchain projects. It was a founding member of the IBM-powered trade finance platform we.trade in 2017 and commodity trading platform Komgo SA in 2018.  Earlier this month, Societe Generale-owned private bank and wealth manager Kleinwort Hambros announced it had launched an exchange-traded note (ETN) with a focus on investing in blockchain companies.  More broadly, a growing number of enterprises have been experimenting with public blockchains, including big players, but issuing actual digital securities by a global investment bank is rare.  In September, the Austrian government announced a pilot to use the ethereum blockchain to notarize the auction of a government bond worth $1.3 billion.  Two months later, Spanish bank BBVA recorded a $150 million syndicated loan on ethereum, time-stamping data on a loan issued for Red Electrica, Spain’s national electrical grid operator.  Among startups, back in 2017, Nivaura initiated a bond denominated in ether for the London-based luxury retail startup LuxDeco.

Previously the desktop app worked for bitcoin's testnet -- think fake bitcoins used to try out programs -- but this is the first time the app will work on bitcoin mainnet, meaning users can use it to send and receive real money. Notably, the app is ""non-custodial"" meaning that users have control over their bitcoin.  Authored by Lightning Labs developers Tankred Hase and Valentine Wallace, the blog post announcing the new app explains:  ""Driving this release is a complete commitment to scaling the principles that Bitcoin was built on: privacy, security, and self-determination. For that we need to go beyond custodial solutions and enthusiast guides and deliver a great user experience for everyone.""  Other apps work with real bitcoin today, including Bluewallet, Zap, and Zeus. But Lightning Labs, originally started by lightning's creators, is perhaps the largest company to release a bitcoin mainnet app so far.  The app works on MacOS, Windows, and Linux devices.  Developers revealing the app are quick to note that although this is a mainnet app, it's still made for ""advanced users"" who want to test out the budding technology. There's still a risk of losing money when sending it on what remains an unfinished technology.  The other big part of the release is that behind the scenes the desktop incorporates ""Neutrino,"" a ""light client"" technology which requires users to download much less of the bitcoin blockchain in order to verify transactions are real. Though other light client technologies exist, Neutrino is more private. (Though, some developers have been known to argue about the protocol's drawbacks.)  Looking ahead, Lightning Labs is eyeballing a release on mobile devices in the future.  The blog post explains that Lightning Labs has plans to move into mobile devices soon as well.  ""[The release] also represents an important stepping stone towards mobile while we continue to invest in performance and stability,"" Hase and Wallace wrote.

42402842,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddC0z,1556038852,Ether Thief Found Stealing Funds With Weak Private Keys,"An unknown entity has been taking advantage of weak private keys to gather up tens of thousands of ETH, according to a new study.  The study -- “Ethercombing: Finding Secrets in Popular Places” -- was undertaken by Independent Security Evaluators (ISE), a security consulting firm, and published Tuesday. The company’s findings were also covered in a story by Wired’s Andy Greenberg.  At one point -- January 2018, during last year’s crypto price ramp -- this amounted to nearly 38,000 ETH, an amount worth more than $54 million. Now, according to the report, the so-called “blockchainbandit” -- holds 44,744 ETH, or $6.1 million worth, in an address discovered amid a search for addresses that are protected by weak private keys. Private keys are strings of data that, in the case of cryptocurrencies, enable users to actually send out transactions from their addresses. These keys need to be closely guarded or may otherwise become compromised, allowing outside actors -- in this case, the blockchainbandit -- to pilfer the funds instead.  At the outset, ISE sought to “discover keys that may have been generated using faulty code, faulty random number generators, or a combination of both,” given that, under normal circumstances, discovering ones created as intended should be “all but impossible,” according to the firm.  All the same, ISE found 732 private keys over the course of its investigation, which combined issued just over 49,000 ethereum transactions. The team also “identified 13,319 Ethereum that was transferred to either invalid destination addresses, or wallets derived from weak keys that at the height of the Ethereum market had a combined total value of $18,899,969.”  Adrian Bednarek, a researcher and analyst for ISE, told Wired that the unknown thief “was doing the same things we were doing but he went above and beyond” and that the process itself was likely automated.  ""Whoever this guy or these guys are, they're spending a lot of computing time sniffing for new wallets, watching every transaction, and seeing if they have the key to them,” Bednarek told the publication.  In the report’s conclusion, ISE wrote that “it should be concluded that any systems that handle private keys will be at an increased threat for targeted attacks” by would-be crypto-thieves.  “Software developers that design software or systems that interact with highly valuable private keys should incorporate all available defense in depth principles to counter present threats and use innovative measures to counter advanced present and future threats against these high value assets,” the team wrote.

42402858,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddCDm,1556037036,BlockFi Is Now Paying Interest on $53 Million of Crypto Deposits,"Crypto lending startup BlockFi has gathered another $18 million of bitcoin and ether deposits since last month, bringing its total interest-earning accounts to $53 million.  The company also lowered its minimum balance to earn interest on bitcoin from 1 BTC to 0.5 BTC and expanded its operations to India, meaning its service is now available globally, except for territories sanctioned by the U.S., U.K. and E.U.  ""We grew the client base around 50 percent in the first half of April from the end of March,"" BlockFi's CEO Zac Prince told CoinDesk Tuesday. ""We expect the quantity of new clients to increase further as we lower the minimum balance requirement for interest earning eligibility. We also see incremental deposits from existing clients, especially around the beginning of the month after interest payments are made.""  However, in response to market conditions, BlockFi has also made its terms less favorable for large ether depositors.  Effective May 1, it will lower the maximum balance for which it will pay 6.2 percent annual interest to 250 ETH from 500. All amounts above that threshold will receive only 2 percent.  ""BlockFi’s ability to pay interest to our clients is based on crypto market lending conditions. As we’ve touched on previously, we exclusively work with institutional counterparties to generate this yield. Over the past month, demand for borrowing ETH has dropped, and as a result, ETH tier rates will be adjusted in tandem,"" the company explained Tuesday.  Fluid terms  The startup, funded by Galaxy Digital, ConsenSys Ventures, SoFi and Kenetic Capital, has been providing fiat loans with bitcoin and ether collateral since January. In March, it launched a new service offering to pay clients interest on their crypto, which it loaned out to institutions. The product promised to pay depositors 6 percent monthly and 6.2 percent in compound interest every year.  However, the terms were amended soon after the launch: at the end of March, the company announced that accounts with more than 25 bitcoin or 500 ether would get 6 percent monthly only on the part of their holdings below that threshold, and 2 percent on the rest. To be clear, BlockFi's terms and conditions explicitly say that the company can change the interest rate at its discretion.  At the time, Prince explained to CoinDesk that the company had too many deposits to keep its business in balance: BlockFi was lending out most of the clients' crypto to institutional borrowers to earn interest, and the demand from the borrowers didn't cover the influx of crypto deposits.  ""We started to see institutional accounts created followed by deposits well over $1 million, which is not who we think of as our core client and not the type of activity we want at this time,” he said then, citing BlockFi's focus on retail depositors.

The San Francisco-based startup's Chicago division, known as Coinbase Markets, was dedicated to creating sophisticated electronic markets technologies such as matching engines and high-frequency trading for cryptocurrency.  Coinbase said a year on, it had made the difficult decision to consolidate the matching engine work being done in Chicago with similar work being done by its team in San Francisco.  A Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk:  “To become the ‘Google of crypto’ we have to be comfortable making big bets. Some of them will be audacious and some of them won't work out.”  Indeed, Coinbase Markets opened to some fanfare. A blog post by the company at the time stated that the Chicago office would provide ""access to a large talent pool of engineers with deep exchange infrastructure experience"" and ""enable us to continue offering the most performant and reliable cryptocurrency exchange.""  The executives leading the Chicago charge, product lead Paul Bauerschmidt (formerly of CME) and engineering head Derek Groothius (former chief software engineer at DRW) will also be leaving the company.  While the office is closing, a handful of employees in Chicago unassociated with the matching engine project will remain with Coinbase, the spokesperson said. In addition, Coinbase said it would look to relocate a small number of Chicago-based matching engine employees to San Francisco.  Flash in the pan  A primary goal of Coinbase Markets was to devise a high-frequency/low-latency trading strategy for cryptocurrencies – the type of arrangement using co-location in specialized data centers made famous by Michael Lewis’s best-selling book, Flash Boys.  The move to wind down the Markets division is a reflection of what Coinbase sees as its highest priorities in courting institutional investors, areas such as crypto custody and over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks.  In terms of what has been built in Chicago, a Coinbase spokesperson confirmed that it will retain the intellectual property and that it may be integrated into the company's technology, concluding:  “The team built some amazing technology and it could be used to influence the future development of our matching engine.”  Coinbase office image via CoinDesk archives",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/23/coinbase-shutters-high-speed-crypto-trading-division-axing-30-jobs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32bdcc1974cb1fb15d2fcf27d896d4adbbdc1e18-1500x895.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A Reuters report on Tuesday, citing “two sources familiar with the matter” said that the Financial Services Agency (FSA) visited the two exchanges to assess their customer protection and anti-money laundering (AML) provisions.  Japanese exchanges run by the two firms have recently seen big changes at the management level, and the FSA investigation was aimed to ensure whether adequate compliance measures are in place under the new regimes, according to the sources.  Through the acquisition of licensed cryptocurrency exchange BitTrade, Huobi Group expanded its trading services to Japan last September.  Fisco, on the other hand, has just become the owner of the Zaif exchange, previously managed by Tech Bureau. After a major hack last September, the previous owner, Tech Bureau, moved to sell the business to Fisco for $44.7 million.  In the breach, Zaif lost approximately $62.5 million in bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and monacoin (MONA).  Since then, registration of new members had been suspended, while trading, depositing and withdrawing MONA had been on hold. The official transfer of the exchange to Fisco took place on Monday and full services resumed today.  Japan is one of the few countries to recognize bitcoin as a legal method of payment. The country passed a law in April 2017 that also brought cryptocurrency exchanges under anti-money laundering (AML)/know-your-customer (KYC) rules and mandated platforms to be licensed.

The work will see the development of new standards for blockchain-based connected devices, also known as the internet of things (IoT), as they relate to work on self-driving cars. The idea is that blockchain could form part of a technological backbone that connects those vehicles to a wider network, and it’s an area that major automakers like GM and BMW are actively investigating as well.  “We are excited to collaborate with the University’s Intelligent Mobility initiative on advancing this cutting-edge vehicle-to-infrastructure communication innovation. This is an important project for all cities preparing for autonomous vehicles as it will demonstrate how secure distributed ledger technology combined with connected, driverless cars and their surroundings can become a trusted reality,” Allison Clift-Jennings, Filament’s CEO, said in a statement.  The University of Nevada’s Intelligent Mobility effort is focused on several areas, including autonomous cars and synchronized transportation, as well as the infrastructure intended to bridge it all together.  The initiative  is being supported by both the private and public sector in Nevada, including the cities of Reno and Carson City, as well as the state government itself.  Filament, which focuses on the development of hardware products for use in blockchain-based connected device networks, is backed by a number of companies that have bet on or would have an interest in a future of connected vehicles, including the venture arms for Intel and JetBlue.

42402847,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddC4v,1556021425,SEC-Fined Crypto Project Abandons Cannabis Co-Working Venture,"A cryptocurrency project previously sanctioned by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is selling a property that it had intended to use as a cannabis co-working space.  The firm, ParagonCoin, revealed the news in a filing with the SEC late last month, stating that, while it had anticipated that its native PRG token could be used by marijuana-industry startups to pay rent for the shared office space, the property is now under contract for sale.  ParagonCoin has put a price tag of $4.2 million on the space, which was purchased for $3.75 million via a $2.45 million loan and cash holdings. The total amount paid for the property was $4.02 million as of May 2018, including interest.  The firm said in the filing:  “We currently do not intend to renovate, improve, or develop other properties. We currently do not intend to make further investments in real estate or acquire any interests in real estate and do not intend to make investments in real estate mortgages.  ParagonCoin explained it will now focus on the continued development of its blockchain ""track and trace"" software product for use in the cannabis business and potentially other industries. Transactions on the system are paid for with PRGs.  Last November, the SEC agreed to register the tokens as securities after the firm settled charges relating to its 2017 ICO. The firm raised $12 million in the sale in order to ""develop and implement its business plan to add blockchain technology to the cannabis industry and work toward legalization of cannabis.""  However, the regulator contended that the startup should have registered its tokens as securities offerings and that it did not qualify for a registration exemption. As a result, ParagonCoin was forced to refund investors, as well as file periodic reports to the SEC and pay a penalty of $250,000.  The token is currently trading at around $0.11, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42402844,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddC3w,1556018163,Crypto Custodian BitGo One-Ups Gemini With Advanced Security Exam,"Crypto custodian BitGo says it has passed an advanced security review by an outside monitor, claiming to be the first crypto startup to receive this level of certification.  Specifically, the company got a SOC 2 Type 2 certification, a standard security audit performed by an outside monitor assuring that a company keeps its security practices in order.  In January, the Gemini exchange, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, received a SOC 2 Type 1 certification from ""Big Four"" auditor Deloitte. BitGo chief security officer Tom Pageler told CoinDesk his company is the first crypto startup to reach the next level.  ""There is no legal requirement for us to do that,"" Pageler said. ""It’s done to legitimize the industry, to let people see that we are treating our work seriously. Our customers would come to us and they want to know who audits us and what is the set of controls we hold ourselves to.""  (To be fair, the Gemini exam covered both its exchange and custody businesses, whereas BitGo's covered custody only, as Tyler Winklevoss noted in a tweet Tuesday after this article was published.)  BitGo would not say which audit firm conducted the Type 2 exam, except that it is one of the so-called Big Four. Last summer, when it passed the Type 1 review, it identified Deloitte as the outside monitor for that exam.  Next level up  The difference between the two exams is that with the Type 1 certification, an auditor makes sure that a company has established an adequate set of controls to maintain security, while Type 2 is checking that the firm follows the rules it set for itself.  “As part of the examination, a service auditor needs to obtain written representations from the company’s management with the description of the company’s system,” said Olga Usvyatsky, vice president of research at Audit Analytics. “In a type 2 report, the auditor will also provide a statement whether these controls were operating effectively at a point in time.”  Both documents are confidential and can be shown only to a company's partners and clients under a non-disclosure agreement.  Eight months' work  It took auditors eight months to complete the Type 2 audit, according to BitGo. The auditor interviewed BitGo’s staff, checked its software, and had access to the building and the data center BitGo is using, Pageler told CoinDesk.  “They wanted to make sure that we are onboarding people properly, that employees have their access removed in a timely fashion, to see how we go about making changes to our system, how we do key management, what major third parties we have relationships with,” he said.  Pageler believes getting professional audits of security management is crucial for the industry to mature. “Building confidence in the cryptocurrency marketplace means having the highest level of controls and processes in place to attract and expand institutional investment,” he said.

42402861,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddCGj,1556017230,Bitcoin Price Sees First ‘Golden Crossover’ Since 2015,"View  Bitcoin’s daily chart is reporting a ""golden crossover"" – a bull cross of the 50- and 200-day moving averages – for the first time since October 2015. The crossover represents a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  A convincing close today above $5,466 (April 10 high) would establish another bullish higher high and boost the prospects of a rally to $6,000.  That rally, however, may be preceded by consolidation or price pullback, as the golden crossover is accompanied by the overbought readings on the relative strength index and a neutral long/short ratio.  The case for a pullback to $5,000 would strengthen if the price fails to close (UTC) today above $5,466 (April 10 high).  With bitcoin’s (BTC) move to five-month highs Tuesday, a notable bull cross of key moving averages has formed for the first time in nearly four years.  The crypto market leader jumped to $5,627 on Bitstamp earlier today – the highest level since Nov. 18 – having revived the short-term bullish case with a repeated defense of key support at $5,170 last week.  Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average (MA) has crossed the 200-day MA from below, confirming a long-term bullish pattern known as a “golden crossover” in technical parlance. This is the first golden crossover since October 28, 2015. Many analysts consider the indicator an advanced warning of stronger price gains in the long term.  The crossover, however, is based on moving averages, which are backward-looking in nature. For instance, the 50-day MA is based on 1.5-month old data, while the 200-day MA responds to more than six-month-old price action.  Hence, the indicator is more a confirmation of the recent bull run, rather than a signal of further price gains.  That said, the investor community may take heart from the fact that bitcoin’s previous bull market began just two days after the golden crossover in 2015.  Daily charts 2015/2019: Golden crossover confirmed  As can be seen (above left), the 50-day MA last crossed the 200-day MA from below on Oct. 28, 2015, and prices confirmed a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change with a close above $319 (July 12, 2015 high) two days later.  The follow-through to that positive trend change was strong and BTC went on to reach an all-time high of $20,000 by December 2017.  This time round, the confirmation of the golden crossover has been preceded by the violation of the bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern on April 2.  While there is a reason to be optimistic, the golden crossover lags price, as discussed earlier. Further, it tends to work as a contrary indicator in the short-term if the market is looking overbought, which looks to be the case currently.  RSI and Long/short ratio  The cryptocurrency’s move to five-month highs has pushed the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) above 70 – a sign of overbought conditions. Hence, a price pullback cannot be ruled out in the short term.  Supporting that argument is bitcoin’s long/short ratio, which has shed the bullish bias. The ratio of BTC/USD long to short positions on Bitfinex (right) is currently hovering just below 1.00 – the lowest level since early January – having printed a high of 1.53 on April 8.  The sharp decline indicates the sentiment has turned from bullish to neutral over the last 15 days. Note that a reading well below 1.00 indicates a bearish bias, while an above-1.00 print represents a bullish market.  Daily chart: UTC close is key  A close above the April 10 high of $5,466 would establish another bullish higher high and strengthen the case for a rally toward $6,000.  However, with the golden crossover accompanied by the overbought readings on the RSI, as well as a bullish-to-neutral shift in the long/short ratio, prices may fail to close above $5,466 or the bullish close could be short-lived.  The odds of a fallback to $5,000 would rise if today’s candle ends in the red well below $5,466, validating the lower high (bearish divergence) of the RSI.

42402854,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddC6t,1556013651,"Civic Inks Deal to Bring Blockchain ID to 1,000 Vending Machines","It started with selling beer, but age verification could crack open a whole industry to cryptocurrency.  CoinDesk previously reported on the demonstration of Civic's beer-selling machinery at this year's South by Southwest (SXSW). Now the company is announcing partnerships with 12 major automated retail companies – AAEON, AR Systems, Fastcorp Vending, Global Vending Group, greenbox Robotics, Invenda, IVM, IVS, Retail Automated Concepts, SandenVendo, The-Venders and Wemp – to bring similar technology to the masses.  ""Vending machines represent an introduction to the mass market, where people can see how digital identity functions in the real world, as well as opening up an entirely new market for automated retail,"" CEO Vinny Lingham said in a statement.  The 12 partners control more than a million internet-connected vending machines, according to Civic. The identity startup expects the technology to be used in 1,000 machines by the end of 2019.  For users, verification will rely on document scans (of a driver's license, in most cases) to confirm age and identity as the rollout takes place. Civic's demo at SXSW had previously used ""knowledge-based authentication,"" that is, a series of questions only one person would be likely to correctly answer. This form will continue to be an option for vendors who prefer it, according to a spokesperson.  Stablecoin solution  Lingham told CoinDesk the company expects to use Gemini's GUSD in the Civic Pay app (and perhaps others, later).  Stablecoins don't have the volatility of other cryptocurrencies (such as Civic's own CVC token), so when customers buy something through the Civic Pay app, they will most likely use GUSD (purchased through Civic) to pay for it. Participating merchants will receive the stablecoin and a much lower transaction fee.  ""For non-age-gated products, the vending machine industry is dying for a cheaper, faster transaction,"" Lingham told CoinDesk. ""They can save 80–90 percent on transaction fees.""  For its part, Civic may still pay credit card fees but it faces a lower chargeback risk because the app has already verified the identity of the user.  ""Our risks are substantially lower than a vendor taking a credit card transaction,"" Lingham said.  Civic declined to disclose a timeline for stablecoin deployment on the app.  Beyond beer  Tobacco, alcohol and hemp-related products will establish Civic's beachhead in the automated retail sector, Lingham told CoinDesk.  Beyond that, the advantages of using Civic Pay to dodge transaction fees could push the app into other categories. However, Lingham also highlighted another area that the company hopes to move into: pharmaceuticals.  While not necessarily age-gated, there are a variety of products that many users need frequently (for example, asthma medication, insulin or prescription antihistamines) that require identity verification. Today, this is done by visiting a pharmacy counter, but Lingham says Civic is in talks to bring its technology to this vertical, though the timeline is much further out.  ""This is where it's going. It's not there yet,"" Lingham said.  Civic will be demoing its application at the National Automated Merchandising Association's NAMA Show in Las Vegas from April 24–26.  ""The vending machine market is flourishing and being the first to adopt industry-changing technology is critical to providing the best user experience,” Mike Weiser, SandenVendo’s CEO and president, said in a statement. According to the company, it controls over 800,000 machines.

The world's top cryptocurrency exchange by adjusted volume announced the news on Tuesday, saying that while trading will begin ""at a later date,"" users can now create wallets on Binance DEX.  A representative told CoinDesk that trading will launch ""as soon as tokens are issued and listed on Binance DEX, and trading pairs are created. We're expecting this to happen soon, in the next few days.""  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in the announcement:  ""We believe decentralized exchanges bring new hope and new possibilities, offering a trustless and transparent financial system. ... With no central custody of funds, Binance DEX offers far more control over your own assets.”  The news comes just a week after the firm announced its native blockchain, Binance Chain, was live. Its exchange token BNB has also been launched as the native asset on the blockchain to replace the previous ethereum ERC-20 token. Holders of the ERC-20 BNB can now swap them for the native form on Binance.com.  Binance Chain supports various wallets at launch, including Binance's official Trust Wallet, as well as offerings from Coinomi, Ledger, Enjin, Exodus and more. The exchange is also inviting other crypto projects to get involved by issuing new tokens on Binance Chain.  The launch of the DEX follows a two-month testing period, during which Binance said nearly 8.5 million transactions were made across various competitions and programs.  The DEX platform offers a similar interface to its existing centralized exchange, with some additional features, such as an option to generate a 24-word mnemonic seed phrase to secure users’ private keys.  In March, Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx also announced a plan to launch a decentralized exchange called OKDEx on its own blockchain OKChain. The exchange said that OKChain is currently at the “final” development stage and that a test network launch is expected in June.  And, last summer, Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi said it would evolve into a standalone DEX, at the time offering funding for developer assistance in creating an open-sourced blockchain protocol for the effort.

The Santa Clara County’s District Attorney's Office announced Monday that the thief, Joel Ortiz, had hacked the cellphones of at least 40 individuals. Ortiz was a “prolific” SIM swapper, the Attorney's Office said, adding that in one crime in May 2018, he stole more than $5.2 million “in minutes” from a cryptocurrency entrepreneur in Cupertino, California.  He “lavishly” spent the stolen funds, including $10,000 at Los Angeles clubs, hiring a helicopter to go to a music festival and on Gucci luggage and clothing, according to the announcement.  Ortiz was taken into custody at Los Angeles International Airport last year and pleaded no contest (accepting the charges but not pleading guilty) to 10 felony theft charges earlier this year.  After two hearings, Ortiz was sentenced on Friday by Santa Clara County Judge Edward Lee, becoming one of the first people in the U.S. to be convicted of stealing cryptocurrency by SIM swapping.  Judge Lee said:  “These are not Robin Hoods. These are crooks who use a computer instead of a gun. They are not just stealing some ethereal, experimental currency. They are stealing college funds, home mortgages, people’s financial lives.”  The case was investigated by the REACT (Regional Enforcement Allied Computer Team) Task Force, which subsequently seized $400,000 from Ortiz after his arrest. The rest of the funds have either been spent or have been concealed, the Attorney's Office said.  SIM-swap hacks – in which attackers manage to clone victims' SIM cards in order to access online accounts – are an increasingly popular means of crypto theft. Earlier this year, a 20-year-old man from Ohio was formally charged in a New York Supreme Court indictment for stealing the identities and cryptocurrency holdings of over 50 victims across the U.S. via SIM-swaps.  In November, U.S.-based law firm Silver Miller filed arbitration claims against AT&T and T-Mobile on behalf of victims of SIM-swap hacks, saying one of its clients had lost over $621,000 in cryptocurrency in this way.  The law firm alleged:  “By leaving holes in their security protocols and failing to properly train and monitor their employees, cellphone providers have assisted thieves in remotely taking over the SIM cards in people’s smartphones, accessing financial records and account information of the victims, and emptying the victim’s accounts of cryptocurrency and other valuable assets.”  SIM card image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/23/student-gets-10-year-jail-term-for-sim-swap-crypto-thefts-worth-75-million,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f96280612d76402515d7d5034c127a91f7cdf77-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At 04:00 UTC, the world’s premier cryptocurrency, whose market capitalization accounts for more than half of all other cryptocurrencies combined, picked up a bid and saw its price climb as high as $5,650 in less than 10 minutes on April 23 - its highest price since Nov. 18, 2018.  At the time of writing, bitcoin’s price has since pulled back slightly, now trading across exchanges at an average price of $5,586, according to CoinDesk’s price data.  Also up roughly 1.48 percent on the day, bitcoin’s individual market capitalization rose to its highest value since mid-November, $96.9 billion, while its percent share of the broader cryptocurrency market, also known as its “dominance rate,” is currently at 53.2 percent, according to CoinMarketCap.  CoinMarketCap data also reveals the cryptocurrency’s exchange trade volume reached 15 billion in the last 24 hours, yet those figures may be misleading as suggested by a recent report from asset management firm Bitwise, which identified 95 percent of the reported trading volume on CoinMarketCap to be fake, with only 10 exchanges reporting honest figures.  These 10 exchanges combined, which include the likes Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp and more, reported $1.7 billion worth of total bitcoin trading volume in 24-hours, according to Messari.io.  Generally accompanied by a strong move in bitcoin’s price are similar movements in the USD value of most other cryptocurrencies.  Indeed, the broader market is flashing green today with nine of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap rank reporting gains above two percent, the strongest performer of which, Cardano (ADA), is now up 9.71 percent on the day, CoinDesk data shows.  In all, the total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market increased roughly 6.3 billion during today’s rally and now stands at $184.3 million, down roughly 78.2 percent from it’s all-time high of $835 billion achieved on January 7, 2018.
