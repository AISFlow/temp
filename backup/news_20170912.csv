42427737,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3Yxh,1505251735,"North Korea Is Targeting South Korea's Bitcoin Exchanges, Report Claims","North Korea, a pariah state widely believed to have been behind cyberattacks on financial institutions around the world, may also have tried to pilfer cryptocurrencies to get around sanctions.  Actors tied to the isolated nation have been involved in attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, FireEye, a prominent cybersecurity firm, said in a report today.  ""Since May 2017, we have observed North Korean actors target at least three South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges with the suspected intent of stealing funds,"" Luke McNamara, a senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at FireEye, wrote in a blog post published Monday. ""The spearphishing we have observed in these cases often targets personal email accounts of employees at digital currency exchanges, frequently using tax-themed lures and deploying malware ... linked to North Korean actors suspected to be responsible for intrusions into global banks in 2016.""  The claims come at a time when the communist nation's relations with the international community – never all that warm – have been particularly frosty.  On Tuesday, the UN Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions against North Korea a week after it conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test to date.  McNamara's post did not identify the three exchanges allegedly targeted or give any indication that the theft attempts were successful. An incident in April, in which wallets at the South Korean exchange Yapizon were compromised, cannot be clearly tied to North Korean actors, he wrote.  Cryptocurrency may be an appealing way for Pyongyang to skirt international financial controls, suggested McNamara, who is based in the Washington, D.C., area.  ""If actors compromise an exchange itself (as opposed to an individual account or wallet) they potentially can move cryptocurrencies out of online wallets, swapping them for other, more anonymous cryptocurrencies or send them directly to other wallets on different exchanges to withdraw them in fiat currencies such as South Korean won, US dollars, or Chinese renminbi,"" McNamara wrote, adding:  ""As the regulatory environment around cryptocurrencies is still emerging, some exchanges in different jurisdictions may have lax anti-money laundering controls easing this process and make the exchanges an attractive tactic for anyone seeking hard currency.""  The Permanent Mission to the United Nations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42427751,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3ZLh,1505246720,Analyst: Cryptocurrency Mining Is Boosting AMD and Nvidia Stock Prices,"At least one major Wall Street firm expects that the stock prices for Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) will continue climbing as both companies continue to pursue opportunities in the cryptocurrency mining market.  Nvidia has seen its stock jump almost 180 percent over the last year, while AMD has jumped 112 percent as well, thanks to cryptocurrency miners' extensive need for powerful graphics processing units (GPUs). Global investment banking firm Jefferies believes the market for GPUs will remain strong over the next several months, according to a new report.  According to a client note written by Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis, the stocks are the market's top performers for the past year – a state of affairs that is expected to continue looking ahead.  In the letter (quoted by CNBC), Lipacis said:  ""We think that the risk of a 'crypto-driven' inventory correction driving material downside is low in the near term ... Both AMD and NVDA have introduced 'cryptospecific GPU [stock-keeping unit]' that have a low risk of competing with core gaming GPUs in secondary markets.""  Both companies have taken advantage of cryptocurrency mining by developing and selling GPU models specific to that market. Cryptocurrency mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain, creating new coins in the process as a reward.  Looking ahead  In the long-term, Lipacis does not expect either company to have to compete with second-hand equipment being sold by miners after they are through with the machines.  At the same time, Lipacis suggested that GPU prices could dip, an eventuality that may have an impact on the stock prices.  Even if the market for mining GPUs collapses, Lipacis does not believe it will have a major impact on either company's bottom line. He expects AMD to undergo a 3% drop and Nvidia to undergo a 10% decrease in the event of a major catastrophe.  As previously reported, both companies have moved to capitalize on the interest in GPUs among the world's miners. Nvidia's CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang, recently declared that ""cryptocurrencies and blockchain are here to stay,"" signaling his firm's long-term plans for the market.  While AMD hasn't been as outwardly bullish in its own public statements, the company has seen significant interest in its products from miners as well.

42427734,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3Yrh,1505241962,Jamie Dimon: Bitcoin Is a 'Fraud',"JP Morgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon doubled down on his past criticisms of bitcoin today, declaring it a ""fraud"" and saying he would fire any trader known to be trading the cryptocurrency.  Dimon gave the remarks during an appearance at an event hosted by Barclays, according to reports from Bloomberg and CNBC. A long-time critic of bitcoin – he said that the cryptocurrency would ""not survive"" back in November 2015 when the price was fluctuating around the $400 level.  Dimon aimed his remarks at the activity in the world's cryptocurrency markets and echoed those who've said that they're in bubble territory.  He was quoted as saying:  ""It's worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed.""  Dimon later added that the cryptocurrency ""will blow up,"" according to CNBC. It was also during that appearance that said that he would terminate any trader that he found to be trading bitcoin for being ""stupid.""  In the wake of his speech, some observers, including Bloomberg, noted that bitcoin prices started to fall after Dimon's remarks. Other factors likely shaping the market today are continued fears that China will move to close domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, a state of affairs that has already led at least one trading platform to freeze its operations.  Bitcoin prices are currently at $4,077.82, down more than 2% for the day, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

42427729,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3Ynh,1505235917,$75 Million Goal: Kik ICO Kicks Off to Small Scams and Big Demand,"Mainstream ICOs may have finally arrived.  The much anticipated token sale for social messaging giant Kik, which is today offering buyers the chance to purchase tokens that will power future apps on its platform, launched at 9 a.m. EST. In total, Kik is looking to raise a total of $125 million through the ICO, though it's already raised $50 million from the private sale of its token, called Kin, to institutional investors.  Going forward, the remaining tokens are to be sold in two parts: today's sale allows investors to purchase up to 15.2 ETH in Kin tokens, with any remaining tokens to be sold tomorrow should that limit not be reached.  While the exact totals are difficult to determine (some transactions have yet to confirm), the preliminary figures suggest Kik is performing comparably to other major ICOs focused more on die-hard technology users. In response to requests for comment, Kik declined to confirm the amount it has so far raised, stating its final fundraising totals will be posted on its website tomorrow.  Still, the Kik fundraising should help push up the total earned by ICOs to date. All time, more than $1.8 billion has now been raised via the funding method, according to data from the CoinDesk ICO Tracker.  Scams and complaints  That's not to say there weren't issues with the sale.  Prior to the launch, a fake URL was distributed on social media boasting the ICO had begun 40 minutes prior to the official launch. That malicious address has since acquired 70.9 ether ($21,656.82), and some donations to the scam site were quite substantial, with payments of up to 5 ether ($1,527.20) sent earlier today.  Phishing scams and other malicious schemes are popping up frequently surrounding the investment schemes. Last month, ICO scammers stole $500,000 in ether from supporters of the Enigma blockchain project following a security compromise.  Further, there were some issues reported when an audit was published by smart contracts security firm Zeppelin Solutions yesterday that found issues with Kik's code.  Zeppelin Solutions published its full review complete with errors, comments and corrections, and some took to Twitter to declare their outrage. There, blockchain researcher Udi Wertheimer went so far as to assert that it was ""unbelievable"" that Kik had not fixed the issues prior to the sale.  The reaction may be more understandable given the sale is one of the most widely anticipated due to the familiarity of the Kik brand.  As such, the comments will likely add to the narrative that ICOs might benefit from a longer development timeframe given their unique (and still relatively untested) combination of experimental fundraising and technology.

42427742,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3Z5h,1505234164,Bitcoin OTC Service Suspends Trading Citing China Pressure,"BitKan, an over-the-counter (OTC) trading service for cryptocurrencies in China, announced today that it will suspend operations amid growing scrutiny from domestic regulators.  In the news post, BitKan said it would suspend its trading service beginning at 12:00 a.m. on September 14, a notable development given rumors that OTC markets may be excluded from a possible ban. The suspension will affect both its Web-based and mobile users, but withdrawals and deposits will remain active, according to the firm.  The statement noted that the suspension is a result of an announcement published by People’s Bank of China on September 4 in which seven local financial regulators announced a ban on illegal initial coin offering (ICO) fundraising and trading activities.  BitKan's statement explains:  ""After the suspension of the OTC service, BitKan’s wallets will continue functioning normally. Deposition and withdrawal of funds will not be affected.""  The service did not say when – or whether – it would resume its OTC trading. However, the disclosure nonetheless highlights the escalating impact the Chinese government's recent policy moves have had on the local cryptocurrency industry.  In the past few days, reports have emerged claiming that China is on the cusp of a blanket ban on exchange-based cryptocurrency trading. Yet thus far, major exchanges in China have all said that no official notice has been received from regulators.  BitKan did not respond to inquiries for further comment.

42427749,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3ZNh,1505230253,Ether Nurses China Hangover as Price Struggles Above $300,"Cryptocurrencies appear to be regaining poise following last week's news from China, with the ether-US dollar exchange rate (ETH/USD) rising to a four-day high of $316.73 today.  Such a move might first appear like a rebound. The digital currency fell to a low of $291 on Friday and extended losses to $276 over the weekend on both China's formal ICO ban, as well as its rumored, but unconfirmed, ban on exchange trading.  Despite the recovery, however, there are signs ether is still feeling the heat of both moves.  While ether climbed above $300, weak volumes would suggest the move lacks substance. All in all, the cryptocurrency is having a tough time scoring big gains above $300.  China's crackdown on ICOs may be bad for the market, but it's worse for ethereum, as its blockchain serves as a platform for new token creation.  As per CoinMarketCap, ethereum has gained 3.11% in the last 24 hours. At press time, the digital currency traded at $302 levels. Week-on-week, the ETH/USD pair is down 4.4%. On a monthly basis, ETH is up just 3%.  Technicals  Daily chart - Recovery lacks substance, Potential Head & Shoulders reversal  The chart above shows highest volume was seen on September 9, when prices dropped from $350 to $275.  Since then, an anemic recovery has been seen in prices, while volumes have steadily dropped. Thus, the recovery from the low of $275 lacks substance, i.e. an absence of fresh buyers means the recovery could be a product of profit taking on the shorts.  Head and Shoulders is a chart formation that predicts a bullish-to-bearish trend reversal. It works best when formed at the top of the uptrend as is the case with ether. A break below the neckline [line drawn from two lows] marks a trend reversal.  A nice topping pattern could be unfolding on the daily chart - The breach of rising trend line followed by a completion of the head and shoulders pattern.  The 5-day moving average and the 10-day moving average is sloping downwards and did cap the upside in prices today. The downward sloping moving averages suggest potential for another dip in prices.  View  Ether's recovery is likely to be short lived. Prices could revisit $275-$266 levels. An end of the day close below $266 would indicate the rally from the low of $136 has ended.  On the higher side, only a break above $338.66 [Sep 7 high] would revive the bullish view.  Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

According to local media, SBI Ripple Asia will now work alongside blockchain and AI solutions provider DAYLI Intelligence for the expansion of the scheme into South Korea.  SBI Ripple Asia was founded in early 2016, with an eye to amplifying the use of Ripple products and services in Asian markets, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  The venture is also planning a program, commencing in October, to train engineers from around 20 companies in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.

42427735,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3Yvh,1505223048,"IBM Joins Automakers, Banks in Blockchain Wallet Project Expansion","IBM has joined car manufacturer ZF Friedrichshafen and investment bank UBS in an effort to build and develop a blockchain-based mobile payment system for the automotive industry.  Announced today at the Frankfurt Auto Show, the partnership is being positioned as one that conceives how driverless vehicles might automatically authorize payments, as well as act as a digital operator for the vehicle, in the future.  ""Car eWallet is an innovative, digital assistant in the car that allows secure and convenient payments even on the go. Moreoever, it can also perform other tasks, like opening the trunk or doors,"" the companies said in a statement today.  According to the companies involved, using a blockchain will prevent the need for a third-party vendor or central computing hub to process transactions and commands. The distributed nature will instead allow for a ""reliable and unchangeable data record.""  ZF originally announced the Car eWallet system in Januaryhttps://www.zf.com/corporate/en_de/magazine/magazin_artikel_viewpage_22227304.html, at the time promising to develop a payment system to aid the charging of electric cars. At the time, ZF planned for Car eWallet to facilitate a car-sharing system, as well as ensure more secure package delivery by having items be dropped directly into a car's trunk.  IBM will reportedly now use its blockchain infrastructure to further develop a secure system which can carry out the required tasks, as well as show authorized users information that is relevant to their vehicles and carry out transactions in real-time.  Overall, the move comes in an active time for the auto industry, which is newly exploring potential blockchain applications.

42427757,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3ZPh,1505221207,Bear Call? Ether-Bitcoin Trading Pair Positions for Weak September,"The ether-bitcoin exchange rate (ETH/BTC) could be preparing for a breakout.  At press time, ether is trading at 0.07165 BTC (about $310), with the cross-cryptocurrency exchange rate coming off a recent low of 0.0655 BTC ($284) on August 15. Yet, as it is widely believed that ethereum's main purpose is to serve as the launchpad for decentralized applications, the platform's cryptocurrency could emerge as one to watch in the months ahead.  Ethereum developers have now set September 18 as a date for Byzantium Testnet launch. The first of two phases in the platform's coming 'Metropolis' update, it's likely to see better ethereum applications created and distributed more widely.  Given a potential increase in usability, it's possible ether could extend its already impressive year-to-date gains. At one point of time in June, ether-US dollar exchange rate was up 2,800%.  However, while the ETH/USD pair has been kind to traders so far this year, price chart analysis indicates that ETH/BTC is be setting up for a violent move, most probably to the downside.  In simple terms, ETH could take a hit against BTC.  Bearish bias  ETH/BTC has been consolidating for more than a month now, and as the textbook says, the bigger the period of consolidation, the bigger the breakout.  What we have on the daily chart is a descending triangle pattern, which forms when a falling trend line and a horizontal support line converge. Descending triangle is typically a bearish continuation pattern formed during a downtrend, but there are instances when descending triangles form as reversal patterns at the end of an uptrend.  Technicals  Daily chart  The above chart shows a sideways breach of the falling trend line, which is hardly encouraging for those who are long ether. A downside break of the descending triangle pattern would signal continuation of the sell-off from the June 13 high of 0.1560 BTC. The move lower could be extended to 0.04 BTC levels.  Only a move above the August 9 high of 0.0940 BTC would revive the bullish view.

42427739,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3Z3h,1505217607,Euroclear Alternative Seeks Public Listing for Blockchain Securities,"Solidum is gearing up to take its blockchain-based securities public.  Last month, the traditional investment firm issued notes based on a reinsurance contract without the need for Euroclear, the widely used post-settlement provider. Instead, Solidum was able to issue $14.8 million in securitized notes using its own proprietary ILSBlockchain.  The insurance-linked securities specialist built its blockchain platform after losing its connection to Euroclear last year, and now sees the platform as a way for other providers like itself to offer similarly sized investments that traditional settlement companies might typically turn away.  But as a private placement, the offering was limited not only in amount, but also in who could invest. Now, the company is working to open the door to issuing larger dollar amounts to more investors by becoming a ""listing member"" of The International Stock Exchange (TISE), based in Guernsey, a British Crown dependency.  Fiona Le Poidevin, the CEO of TISE, confirmed the exchange has had conversations with Solidum about how securities issued on its blockchain might someday be publicly listed.  ""I very much look forward to seeing how Solidum's venture develops,"" she told CoinDesk in an email.  Solidum is currently in talks with the Guernsey Financial Services Commission to ensure the platform is compliant with TISE requirements, which include paying an initial £10,000 ($13,000) fee and £6,000 per year after that.  Until then, though, the reinsurance contract itself remains with the original provider and the securitized notes purchased by the counterparties can be traded like any other security, until the notes are due in 2023.  To jumpstart that trading, Solidum partner and portfolio manager Cedric Edmonds said two funds are currently in the process of clearing regulatory requirements to join the group. Once that process is complete and the first trades commence, Edmonds expects those who have been unable to gain access to traditional platforms to be ILSBlockchain's early adopters.  About his mission, Edmonds said:  ""You're basically taking the banks and Euroclear out of the system.""  Challenging the incumbents  While Solidum is now out to make banks and settlement platforms less necessary, the project has its roots in a thwarted effort to do business the old-fashioned way.  The company began issuing its first private placements in 2010, working with Germany's Deutsche Bank to gain access to Euroclear until last year. In those days, the European clearing and settlement house would create the notes, and then Solidum would settle them with investors using the traditional delivery-versus-payment method.  But last year, Edmonds said, internal changes at Deutsche Bank resulted in Solidum losing access to Euroclear. Deutsche Bank declined comment for this article.    Following a period of looking for alternate banks to reestablish access to Euroclear — or even the London Stock Exchange Group's Crest settlement system — Edmonds stumbled across Multichain, an open-source protocol inspired by the bitcoin blockchain.  After downloading the Multichain software in April, Edmonds spun up a series of nodes to test how the shared ledger technology might be modified to ""mirror what people do within the regular financial markets,"" he said.  The outcome: ""It did exactly what I wanted.""  Not just another middleman  Despite blockchain work conducted by Euroclear and other similar platforms around the world, Edmonds believes he's created a new way for investors deemed too small for Euroclear to access similar functionality – but at far less expense.  The portfolio manager said that, while traditional middlemen collectively charge between $50,000 and $100,000 annually for the services, companies that want to issue securities through ILSBlockchain would only need to pay $2,500.  ""If you take out Euroclear, and you take out the bank from trying to control everything, then you start to reduce the fees quite drastically,"" Edmonds said. ""In a way, Euroclear shot themselves in the foot.""  Solidum's role here might resemble then a new, albeit more efficient, middleman. However, Edmonds said his company is little more than a gatekeeper.  In its first issuance, Solidum managed the blockchain nodes representing various roles, including playing the role of paying agent and blockchain sponsor, overseeing compliance with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations.  But in the future, he said users themselves could manage nodes, concluding:  ""We don't have an overriding system that controls it. Once we've created the nodes, given people access to the system, we can turn off our server and everyone can carry on quite happily.""

Breaking the news last week, the company said on its website that it would begin moving toward trials of the scheme next month. Though a firm date wasn't released for full production, DMM indicated that it would do so by the end of the year if the trials were successful.

DMM, founded in 1999, is led by billionaire Keishi Kameyama and got its start in the pornography business before expanding to a range of e-commerce and digital services. Notably, the company also has a subsidiary that is the second largest forex company in the world by trading volume, according to figures from 2014.

42427731,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3Yph,1505210585,"China's ICO Ban: Understandable, Reasonable and (Probably) Temporary","Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.      Nine months after issuing warnings to bitcoin exchanges, China's central bank again sent the cryptocurrency markets tumbling last week.  This time, its focus was on initial coin offerings (ICOs). On September 4, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) issued a sharp statement labelling token sales ""illegal and disruptive to economic and financial stability."" Analysts blamed this blanket ban for the subsequent sharp decline in cryptocurrency markets, which saw almost $35 billion wiped off of total capitalization in just four days (it has since rebounded somewhat).  While drastic, the ban is understandable and reasonable. And, like the market reaction, probably temporary.  Understandable goals  China's financial market is huge, sprawling and difficult to control. What's more, the rapid growth of innovation and reach has given rise to bubbles in a wide range of asset classes, some more shadowy than others.  This is potentially a very big problem.  Take trillions of dollars-worth of opaque financial products with little regulation, add a get-rich-quick mentality and you have a simmering cauldron of trouble that could overflow at any time. Given the importance the party places on social stability, especially in the run-up to the 19th National Congress, it becomes increasingly obvious that the regulators were going to step in.  Although the Chinese ICO market is relatively small compared to the overall economy, it had been gathering speed. According to the Beijing Internet Finance Association, in the first seven months of this year, approximately 65 ICOs raised almost $400 million.  And the accelerating fervor – another report claims that the amount raised in July and August alone reached over $750 million – no doubt set alarm bells ringing.  Reasonable steps  But, an overall ban on ICO activity, isn't that a bit harsh? On the contrary, it could turn out to be the most sensible way to protect investors at this early stage.  While the overall reaction to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) warning on ICOs earlier this year was positive (with most welcoming it as a potential hype-deflator), many criticized it for not going far enough. Declaring that tokens ""might"" be securities seems to have had little effect on the plans of many would-be issuers.  Many point to the support shown by Quebec and the Isle of Man for ""light"" regulation as a more constructive way to handle ICOs.  While they may be right, a direct comparison is meaningless – the relative size of those markets means that they can afford to be less risk-averse and more pro-innovation.  Given the potential spread of the Chinese ICO market, a case-by-case evaluation is impractical. Additionally, the severity of the risk is disconcerting – the central bank has alleged that a startling 90 percent of issuances so far this year may have been fraudulent.  Temporary breather  China, however, is not averse to innovation, even of the financial kind. While it came late to the securitization party, it has since been making up for lost time. And its payments sector is among the most technologically advanced in the world.  Furthermore, the Chinese central bank is not averse to blockchain development. It recently announced an active push on blockchain research, even sending a delegation to the U.S. to learn more. And late last year it revealed that it had been testing a blockchain-based digital currency.  So, the ICO ban is not a statement on either blockchain or innovation. Given the authorities' recognition that they need to continue to modernize the financial system, and the desire to become an increasingly important player in global markets, it is unlikely that the ban will last for long.  The most likely scenario is that the prohibition is akin to hitting the ""pause"" button. This should give the market time to settle down and the regulators a window in which to get consumer protections in place.  In addition, Chinese regulators have a history of stepping in, slowing things down and then stepping back.  Now what?  In a country famous for its traffic jams, financial market regulation can be likened to driving a car.  Too much pressure on the accelerator (low interest rates and lax oversight) leads to increasing speed and possibly fatal accidents. Slamming down on the brakes (intervention and blanket bans) gets you nowhere, but can give you time to survey your surroundings and plan evasive measures.  Once they're in place, gradually easing up on the clutch while gently pressing the accelerator should give you – and digital tokens – a sensible and sustainable start.

42427745,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3ZBh,1505206807,Bitcoin's Biggest Bull? Arthur Hayes Isn't Long Crypto – He's Short Government,"In the coming war between digital currencies, which side will your money be on?  If that question sounds crazy, meet Arthur Hayes, a former CitiGroup trader who runs BitMEX, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange that allows eye-bulging leverage – up to 100 times – when buying and selling cryptocurrency derivatives.  Not just another Wall Street veteran, Hayes may also be one of the industry's biggest bitcoin bulls. It's a bold claim, but you might agree if you saw his newsletter – a regular synthesis of cryptocurrency news, gangster quotes, GIFs and end-of-the-world premonitions.  In fact, Hayes thinks blockchain is lighting a fuse that will ignite open combat between ""true cryptocurrencies"" (like bitcoin) and a new ""digital fiat"" controlled by central banks.  These two parallel currency systems are the inevitable outcome of his core investing thesis:  ""A digital society needs digital cash.""  In other words, bitcoin has brought the world cryptocurrency and institutions of all kinds will use the technology to their advantage.  Here's what Hayes sees shaking out as a result: Governments will respond to the proliferation of cryptocurrency by withdrawing banknotes from circulation, and governments will issue digital fiat that functions similarly to cryptocurrency.  But don't be fooled, according to Hayes, the similarities here are all on the surface.  Government-controlled digital fiat will be the antithesis of absolutely everything true cryptocurrency stands for. Central bank's issuance of digital money will lead to a brave new world where governments are able to monitor and control every single transaction in an economy.  And countering that overreach is the reason Hayes believes bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have a value proposition not just today, but for years to come.  The digital combatants  When Hayes talks about digital money, he sees the scope of battle on a truly global scale, not just within the U.S., but all across Europe, in China and in India.  What all these country's governments have in common, according to Hayes, is the desire to use digital fiat as a tool of economic control.  He sees digital fiat as an instrument that will allow governments and global central banks to monitor every financial transaction, tax every sale and even lock out people from the payment system if they don't have the right government-issued licenses.  Shifting digital fiat into cryptocurrency, he reasons, will be the only way to preserve privacy. Plus, cryptocurrency will allow individuals and businesses to trade in jurisdictions where parties don't trust electronic fiat – or each other, for that matter – because they know cryptocurrencies cannot be tampered with.  Hayes said:  ""If you want to have a financial presence – and not have somebody else know what you're doing at all times – then you'll use a form of cryptocurrency.""  A form of cryptocurrency that's true, like bitcoin, zcash, monero or dash, he says, is one that offers users both privacy and security. These currencies, according to Hayes, have no utility other than being used as anonymous e-money.  In his mind, when a coin has additional utility it detracts from its desirability to be used as money since its value can fluctuate outside of what Hayes call its ""moneyness.""  One example of a currency that is not money, according to Hayes, is ether, which he says doesn't qualify as money because of its use case for distributed applications.  Not for the everyday  But there may be limits to the value propositions of even true cryptocurrencies today.  For example, Hayes believes that small value transactions are out of line with a once resounding narrative in the space, that bitcoin is – and should be – a payment system for consumers.  Hayes told CoinDesk:  ""I don't think bitcoin is going to replace consumer facing activities, like buying a cup of coffee or buying a magazine at a 7-Eleven.""  Hayes called bitcoin's user experience ""terrible"" for these purchases, because public blockchains are slower than private payment systems. So, for a trip to Starbucks, buying coffee with Apple Pay is a better experience than paying with bitcoin, he contends.  It's an interesting observation in that many of bitcoin's strongest proponents tend to envision a world where the cryptocurrency is used for everything. Even still, Hayes is just as bullish on bitcoin, as he continues to reiterate what a fantastic mechanism it is for online international payments and anonymity.  And ""those trade flows are massive,"" he said.  But despite his bullishness, Hayes doesn't own any coins personally. According to Hayes, he believes his stake in BitMEX gives him sufficient exposure to the crypto market, since BitMEX's performance is tied to higher prices and market caps of cryptocurrencies and digital tokens.  Freedom in derivatives  And BitMEX is exactly the kind of exchange you'd imagine a guy like Arthur Hayes would dream up — a wild, intense, leveraged-fueled ride on a derivatives rocket ship that lets traders place high-powered bets with very little money down.  There's a kind of freedom in derivatives, since they're not tied to the physical delivery of any asset. Instead, derivatives bets play in a virtual world, where the only limits are the money flowing through the system.  That kind of world clearly appeals to Hayes:  ""When you're in the derivatives space you can essentially create any type of exposure you want.""  And he's gone for triple-digit exposure, which not only makes his company ""sexy"" to traders, but also comes with substantial risk.  Such colossal leverage means BitMEX cannot guarantee the settlement of its trades, meaning Hayes can't tell you for certain that you're going to get paid out at 100 cents on the dollar on a winning trade. While Hayes and his BitMEX users enjoy this risk, someone new to the crypto space might be more than a little intimidated.  Yet, Hayes believes that's not reason for swearing off the crypto scene altogether, instead he gives more level-headed advice to newcomers.  ""I would tell that person to buy a small amount of bitcoin,"" he said, noting that bitcoin is a safer bet than most cryptocurrencies because of its $80 billion market cap.  He concluded:  ""Once they are comfortable with that, start doing research and deciding for themselves which coins fit their investment risk profile.""

Announced today, the prototype – focused on the reporting of mortgage transactions – was revealed to have been built with input from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and another unnamed banking institution. The app allows regulators to see real-time updates, with receipts being created for mortgage transactions as they are conducted.  That the FCA would be interested in technology that could enhance its oversight is perhaps unsurprising. To date, the FCA has welcomed a number of startups into its regulatory ""sandbox,"" which allows for the testing of financial products and services in a limited setting.  Last year, FCA director of strategy Chris Woodward said that blockchain was one technology that the agency was considering for possible applications.  ""[This area] is an opportunity for us to understand how we can best support developments and potentially adopt some RegTech solutions ourselves,"" he said at the time.  Indeed, the FCA has gone as far as saying publicly that it wants to give breathing room to startups working with financial technologies, including blockchain. In April, the authority announced that it saw no need – at least for now – to adjust its rules to account for the tech.

42427741,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3Z9h,1505201723,Swiss Town to Accept Tax Payments in Bitcoin,"The municipality of Chiasso in Switzerland is to start accepting tax payments in bitcoin, according to a local news report.  The new scheme, to be put into place for the start of next year, was apparently made following discussion with various blockchain groups based in the area.  There are limits to the scheme, however, and tax payments made in bitcoin cannot exceed 250 Swiss francs (around $265), the report states.  The Mayor of Chiasso, Bruno Arrigoni, was cited as saying that the town is ""recognised internationally as an epicentre of a growing technological and economic growth for both the canton and in Switzerland.""  Nicknamed the ""CryptoPolis,"" Chiasso is set on establishing itself as a rival to the country's blockchain epicentre Zug, and has reportedly seen eight startups set up base there in the past few months.  Zug, which has become famous internationally as Switzerland's ""Cryptovalley,"" announced it would allow citizen to pay for government services in digital currencies back in 2016. However, Zug has not made any move to integrate bitcoin tax payments as an option for its inhabitants.
