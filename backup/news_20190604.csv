42382021,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qUX7,1559687404,The 8 Biggest Bombshells From the SEC's Kik ICO Lawsuit,"When Kik's board of directors decided to support the company's pivot to crypto, one of the board members described it as a ""hail Mary pass.""  It was early 2017 and the Canadian mobile messaging startup, having depleted its venture funding, was months away from firing everyone and calling it quits. The seven most promising leads for a potential acquisition had balked at buying the startup. Kik was in dire straits.  That's all according to a complaint filed Tuesday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging that Kik conducted an ""illegal $100 million securities offering"" with a September 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) for its kin token.  Details revealed Tuesday by the SEC show the company knew it faced pushback from regulators, but that didn't stop Kik from moving forward. Other efforts to keep Kik afloat had failed. To prevent its equity holders from getting wiped out, Kik had to make the cryptocurrency path work, at least according to the version of events presented by the SEC.  In a statement released Tuesday evening, Kik CEO Ted Livingston said the SEC complaint ""presents a highly selective and grossly misleading picture of the facts and circumstances surrounding our 2017 pre-sale and token distribution event. We look forward to presenting the full story in court.”  The fact that investors were never apprised of the company's financial situation seems to be a major sticking important point for Stephan Schlegelmilch and David Mendel, the SEC enforcement staffers who authored the complaint.  Here are seven dramatic findings made by the regulators:  1. Kik was losing money  And they were shrinking. In a year ending in mid-2016, Kik brought in $2.2 million. In a year ending in mid-2017, it brought in $1.5 million. At the time Kik decided to pursue an ICO, its expenses were running at $3 million per month.  As the complaint puts it, ""Despite Kik Messenger’s initial success ... Kik’s costs have always far outpaced its revenues, and the company has never been profitable."" Further, the complaint alleges, its ""executives had no realistic plan to increase revenues through its existing operations.""  2. No one wanted to buy Kik  The Waterloo-based company was founded in 2009, and the regulators argue that Kik's real peers were other mobile-first messaging companies. The complaint mentions Snapchat and WhatsApp, which both managed to repay their investors handsomely (WhatsApp with an acquisition by Facebook and Snapchat with an IPO).  According to the complaint, Kik hired an investment bank in 2016 to look for a buyer. The bank met with 35 potential buyers and seven showed interest. ""By February 1, 2017, however, all seven potential suitors had declined to buy or merge with Kik,"" the complaint reveals.  3. Kik disclosed more information to private-sale buyers than it did to the general public  Buyers who joined Kik's simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) got a discount and went through an investor accreditation check. These investors got a private placement memorandum (PPM), with more information about the company. This PPM disclosed that the Kik messenger was losing users quickly.  The complaint gives more detail on that point, saying, ""Daily average users dropped from more than 10 million in January 2016 to about 6 million in January 2017."" Neither private investors nor those in the general sale got any information about the company's financial position.  4. Kik built special e-stickers for its investors  Kik built a system for kin investors to get special digital stickers in its messenger app. According to the SEC complaint, this was an attempt to make it look like there was an actual use for the kin tokens at distribution. One executive emailed other Kik employees in June 2017 saying that ""COMPLIANCE"" was the only purpose behind the bare-bones sticker product.  The stickers apparently had a honey badger theme. An image of one is included in the complaint. Strangely, investors were not told the system was in development until after the sale was over.  5. CEO Ted Livingston made multiple public statements that token buyers would profit  In a February 2017 email to some employees, Livingston described how they could create a token and then “Buy today, sell tomorrow, profit.”  At a June 2017 Bitcoin Meetup in San Francisco, Livingston said the token boom would be a time in which ""people are going to make a lot of money.""  At an August 2017 conference in Canada, Livingston said that ""everybody can not only build this amazing new ecosystem and platform but also make a ton of money.""  6. Canadian regulators told Kik that its cryptocurrency would indeed be a security  In fact, because of that advice, Kik didn't sell the tokens to the general public in Canada. But it never asked American regulators the same question.  Kik reached out to the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) right after the SEC's DAO report. By early September, OSC staff had shared the opinion that Kik's offering qualified as a security. Canadians were barred from the public sale. Americans, as a class, were not (though some states were blocked).  7. A lot of Americans put a lot of money into the public sale  Of the roughly $100 million raised, Americans put in $55 million. Some $16.8 million of that came in the public sale.  The SEC complaint gives more detail about how they were distributed, reporting that ""United States-based investors included (a) two purchasers who paid about $1.6 million and about $970,000 respectively; (b) 20 purchasers who paid about or more than $100,000; (d) 223 who paid about or more than $10,000; and (d) 1,853 purchasers who paid about or more than $1,000.""  In the complaint, the SEC seeks a variety of forms of relief, including a demand to ""disgorge all ill-gotten gains"" with interest and pay a civil fine.

42382028,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qUfv,1559685603,Steve Case Backs $4.7M Seed Round for Blockchain Database Startup Fluree,"Blockchain startup Fluree, a Public Benefit Corporation, received a $4.7 million round of funding from 4490 Ventures, an early-stage venture capital fund, along with Revolution’s Rise of the Rest seed fund, to develop and market their decentralized data storage ecosystem.  Operating on the principles of complete data integration and immutability, Fluree hopes to eradicate the over-reliance on data silos and API bloat by building bridges off of blockchain technology.  “Fluree stores all data on a blockchain ledger that can be run internally like a traditional data store, or selectively operated in a data network across parties governed by Fluree SmartFunction rules,” wrote Flip Filipowski, co-CEO and co-founder of Fluree, in a statement.  The main goal is to break down trust-barriers between parties that had relied on traditional stores of critical data and spur collaboration across multiple parties by increasing access to and leveraging of data.  Target users of this innovation are those that have been hindered by the static, centralized models of data storage as they begin to integrate into an increasingly interconnected, information-centric world. The ledger will be accessible to those inside and outside the host enterprise, and can be used for both centralized or decentralized operations.  “Data is at the center of the new economy, yet it is managed by the same database approach we’ve had for 40 years,” said Brian Platz, co-CEO and co-founder of Fluree. “A data-centric approach simultaneously saves money, promotes secure enterprise collaboration and provides additional leverage for information across systems.”  Security is another concern Fluree is attempting to solve and to which blockchain provides an answer. To that end, FlureeSmartFunctions dynamically enforces permissions for external parties to access the data, provides proof of data tampering, and guarantees knowledge of who amended or added data.  The company acknowledges the tradeoffs involved in decentralization and will offer options to tune a company’s blockchain if speed is preferred over security.  “If you want 100% decentralization, something like Bitcoin, it’s going to be slow. You can’t have your cake and eat it too,” Platz told TechCrunch. “If you need to, you can decrease the amount of centralization. So there’s a spectrum there, and we focus on giving people the knob to adjust that based on what they’re trying to do,”  Currently, a free version of Fluree is available for developers, as well as a scaling-priced option based on usage. Fluree also offers a licensed version for production deployments.  The product is set for a 2019 open source release.

42382047,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qUhB,1559673051,California CPAs Push for Crypto Accounting Clarity,"The California Society of CPAs is pushing for clarity in accounting and disclosure rules regarding cryptocurrencies, citing a lack of specific guidance within U.S. GAAP, the standard accounting protocols followed in the U.S.  The 54-member committee’s concern is the divergence in reporting methods utilized by companies who itemize cryptocurrencies on their financial statements and whether the varying approaches reflect the nature and risks of holding cryptos.  This accounting confusion is rooted in the varying ways digital assets are viewed, where, depending on the circumstance, cryptocurrencies may be recorded at “lower of cost or market,” at fair value, or as intangible assets. This is because on a balance sheet cryptocurrencies can be reported as anything from a commodity to an investment or even be counted as working capital, according to Andrew Parrish co-founder of Alternate Tax Solutions.  Yet, the Financial Accounting Standards Board notes that many institutional interpretations of digital assets instead define cryptocurrencies as indefinitely-lived intangible assets under ASC 350, or, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. But this is far from the consensus, and will only become more nebulous as digital assets find their way onto more companies’ balance sheets.  “We believe the usage of cryptocurrencies will not diminish over time and will continue to expand in both volume and new fields of application,” said Nancy Rix, Chair of CalCPA’s accounting principles and assurance services committee in a letter to the FASB.  CalCPA believes that the FASB currently pursues a classification model analogous to accounting for foreign currencies. While added rules would address currencies that have an active market and are held by an entity as a medium of exchange or investment.  “We anticipate it will not be long before major public companies start using cryptocurrencies, as illustrated by JP Morgan’s decision to issue JPM Coin in February 2019,"" Rix said.  For now, however, Parrish said that GAAP policies accurately reflect the risks associated with holding cryptocurrencies.  “A balance sheet is a snapshot and every asset carries risk of changing price tomorrow. Even banks can go bankrupt,"" Parrish said.  “If Bitcoin is $100,000 today, and $90,000 tomorrow, you just have to write down the loss,” Parrish said.  Where an asset is accounted for on the books determines not only its value relative to other liabilities and equity, but also whether it is subject to impairment cost, whether it will affect income statements and cash-flow statements.

42382017,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qUTL,1559666090,The SEC Is Suing Kik for Its 2017 ICO,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing Kik for allegedly running an unregistered securities sale when it launched an initial coin offering (ICO) for its kin token in 2017.  In a filing submitted Tuesday in the Southern District of New York, the SEC said Kik violated Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, which requires offerings to be registered.  “By selling $100 million in securities without registering the offers or sales, we allege that Kik deprived investors of information to which they were legally entitled, and prevented investors from making informed investment decisions,” said Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “Companies do not face a binary choice between innovation and compliance with the federal securities laws.”  As alleged in the SEC’s complaint, Kik had lost money for years on its sole product, an online messaging application, and the company’s management predicted internally that it would run out of money in 2017. Kik's losses averaged about $30 million a year, according to the SEC, and earlier attempts by Kik to be acquired by a larger technology company had failed, with seven potential suitors all declining to buy or merge with the company.  In early 2017, Kik sought to pivot to a new type of business, which it financed through the sale of one trillion digital tokens. The company sold its kin tokens to the public, and at a discounted price to wealthy purchasers, raising more than $55 million from U.S. investors. The SEC complaint alleges that kin tokens traded recently at about half of the value that public investors paid in the offering.  According to the complaint, the Ontario Securities Commission previously told the Waterloo, Canada-based Kik that kin appeared to be a security.  Earlier this year, the company told the Wall Street Journal it planned to take the SEC to court if the agency brought an enforcement action against the project.  Last month, Kik CEO Ted Livingston said the company had already spent $5 million engaging with the SEC. Kik then launched a $5 million “Defend Crypto” crowdfunding campaign to support a potential lawsuit.  Kin is used across a suite of mobile apps. Kik has been using its ICO funds to support the development of new marketplaces for people to earn and spend the cryptocurrency, which runs on its own blockchain.  In a statement Tuesday, Livingston said:  “This is the first time that we’re finally on a path to getting the clarity we so desperately need as an industry to be able to continue to innovate and build things.”  Kin's price tanked on the news of the SEC lawsuit, falling more than 25 percent within two hours of the lawsuit's announcement.

According to a press release published Monday, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigation division (IRS-CI), the U.S. Attorney General's office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section are investigating the exchange, which filed for bankruptcy following the death of its founder and a months-long civil rehabilitation process.  The FBI published a questionnaire for victims, asking for personally identifying information, contact information and details about their QuadrigaCX accounts.  ""If you have questions or concerns about your QuadrigaCX account, or if you believe you are a victim, please complete the below questionnaire,"" the release says, adding:  ""Your responses are voluntary but would be useful in the federal investigation and to identify you as a potential victim. Based on the responses provided, you may be contacted by the FBI and asked to provide additional information.""  The FBI and IRS-CI are legally required to provide victims of federal crimes with information, assistance and other resources.  According to Fortune  , the FBI has been investigating Quadriga since at least March, alongside the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  Quadriga's founder and CEO, Gerald Cotten, died during a charity trip to India in December, according to his widow, Jennifer Robertson. A month later, the exchange filed for creditor protection, with professional services firm Ernst and Young (EY) acting as the court-appointed monitor for the exchange. Though the exchange was said to be holding some $134 million in crypto, EY has been unable to locate any of its holdings (aside from 103 bitcoin accidentally transferred to an inaccessible wallet).  As of last month, EY said the exchange has roughly $21 million in assets (including fiat currencies), but could owe customers as much as $160 million.

According to a filing reported by The Next Web, the official operating entity, Blockport BV, was declared bankrupt in a court in Amsterdam on May 21. The platform ceased services at the end of May, as announced in a blog post (although the website is still online as of writing).  In the post, co-founder and chief product officer Sebastiaan Lichter said that following the exchange's failed security token offering – which had a €1 million ($1.12 million) soft cap – ""we have decided to drastically scale down our operations and development.""  Lichter wrote:  ""Running our operations and platform as-is without a substantial investment is currently not an economically viable and responsible option.""  As the exchange currently cannot generate sufficient revenues, he said the focus is now on ""expanding the platform with unique and value-adding technological features, that strengthen our business case for a potential future restart.""  While the operating entity is now bankrupt, Lichter said this would not affect its efforts to prepare for a ""restart"" of the platform.  He continued:  ""We still see a lot of opportunities in this industry and have built a top performing trading platform that many people love to use and which has had almost zero downtime or issues since we launched it in the summer of 2018.""  Customers were given prior warning to withdraw any remaining funds, and according to the post, can still withdraw by emailing support.

42402964,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddx59,1559651426,Retail Giant Carrefour Saw Sales Boost From Blockchain Tracking,"French retail giant Carrefour has attributed a recent increase in sales to its use of blockchain tracking.  Carrefour's blockchain project manager Emmanuel Delerm told Reuters on Monday that the use of blockchain ledger technology to track meat, milk and fruit from farm to supermarket has increased sales of these products.  According to Delerm, blockchain tracking has been particularly successful in China, where shoppers are more used to scanning QR codes. The initiative likewise proved to be popular in Italy and France, where buyers reportedly spend as long as 90 seconds reading merchandise information.  With the firm's blockchain tracking – built with IBM Blockchain – customers can scan a QR barcode on a product with their phone and obtain information such as its date of harvest, farm location and owner, packing date, how long it was transported, and tips on how to prepare it.  “The pomelo [a citrus fruit] sold faster than the year before due to blockchain. We had a positive impact on the chicken versus the non-blockchain chicken,” Delerm said.  Carrefour initially launched blockchain information for 20 items, including chicken, eggs, raw milk, oranges, pork, and cheese, according to the report. Now, the retailer intends to add 100 more products to the system, particularly focusing on products for which consumers want reassurance, such as baby and organic products.  The tech creates a ""halo effect,"" meaning if shoppers feel they can trust one Carrefour product, they will also trust other items, Delerm said.  There are still challenges to blockchain tracking however – particularly in tracking fruit and vegetables sold loose and sourced from a number of farms. There is also some resistance from farmers to sharing too much information, according Delerm.  Carrefour is also working with Nestle, allowing the Swiss food and drinks giant access to its blockchain data for its Mousline potato puree so buyers can see that the produce is sourced from French farms  Carrefour image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Benedict Alibasa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/04/retail-giant-carrefour-saw-sales-boost-from-blockchain-tracking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1464c8588c5bed176064ebf18565c30336b8b5f2-1500x839.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402977,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddxIv,1559647842,Long-Term Support Level May Struggle to Revive Bitcoin Price Rally,"View  Bitcoin is again attempting a recovery from the 30-day moving average, currently at $7,710. The key average has consistently reversed price pullbacks in the last four months.  This time, BTC is more likely to end up creating a bearish lower high (shallow bounce) or may find acceptance below the average in the next day or two, as both the daily and weekly technical indicators are calling a deeper price pullback.  A UTC close below the 30-day MA would open the doors to $7,000.  If the ongoing recovery from the MA ends with a UTC close above $8,103 (today’s high), BTC may rise to $8,500 in the next couple of days.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price pullback seems to have stalled near historically strong support, but a bounce, if any, could be shallow.  The cryptocurrency market leader dived below $8,000 in the Asian trading hours today and almost tested the crucial 30-day moving average (MA) support, currently at $7,707, according to Bitstamp data.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,940, representing a 5 percent drop on the day, having hit a low of $7,932 earlier today.  The minor recovery from levels near the 30-day MA is hardly surprising and could be extended further. After all, the average has consistently reversed price pullbacks over the last four months.  This time, however, BTC, may not be able to rise all the way back to $9,000, as the short duration technical charts are biased bearish and the weekly chart is flashing signs of buyer exhaustion, as discussed yesterday.  Further, the broader market is also looking exhausted. Notably, litecoin (LTC) is struggling to decouple from BTC with a move higher, even though it is set to undergo mining reward halving in August. The supply altering event tends to put a bid under the cryptocurrency months in advance.  Daily chart  BTC breached the 30-day MA on Feb. 8 and has established multiple bullish higher lows (marked by arrows) along that line ever since. Notably, every bounce ended up violating the preceding price high.  The price is again attempting a recovery from the 30-day MA as seen above. However, the bounce will likely be shallow or the cryptocurrency could find acceptance below the average later today, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has dipped below 54.50, confirming a double top breakdown – a bearish reversal pattern.  The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is charting bigger bars below the zero line – a sign the bearish move is gathering strength.  Further, the price drop seen in the last 24 hours validated the bullish-to-bearish trend change signaled by the bearish outside day candle created on May 30.  Weekly chart  The doji candle created last week represents buyer exhaustion. The 14-week RSI is also reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 print.  Meanwhile, the money flow index – also known as volume-weighted RSI – has almost risen to 100 for the first time on record. A reading above 80 represents overbought conditions.  The current print of 98, therefore, indicates the recent rally is extremely overstretched and significant correction is overdue.

42402973,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddxE0,1559646035,Bloomberg Terminal Lists Ethereum-Based Debt Instrument,"Cadence, which puts commercial debt into ERC-20 tokens, is now listed on Bloomberg Terminal.  In a first for a blockchain-based financial instrument, Cadence has obtained a Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI). With this new designation, Cadence becomes easy to research and trade for the broad array of financial professionals working with Bloomberg Terminal, the market-leading software. Each FIGI record carries with it metadata such as interest rate, maturity schedule and instrument type.  In Cadence's case, it also includes the smart contract address on Ethereum.  Cadence  works with the sort of debt businesses need to cover short-term gaps in cash flow. Founder Nelson Chu said this industry has run on Excel spreadsheets and phone calls, making it very opaque.  Chu told CoinDesk:  ""We are creating an immutable ledger that houses all asset-level performance data at every stage of its lifecycle, from inception through maturity. This creates an oracle of asset performance data that every counterparty in a private credit transaction can reference to accurately price, structure and invest.""  The firm has made eight issuances so far, with one-month, three-month and nine-month maturities, and automatic rollovers. All are viewable on the terminal.  Richard Robinson, Bloomberg's data standards lead, said in a press release:  “The assignment of a FIGI to digital assets is a natural and simple example of the standard's native utility. It is proof that FIGI can easily extend to new, even esoteric financial instruments.""  The FIGI was first developed as the Bloomberg Global Identifier (BBGID) before being open-sourced in 2014 and embraced by the computer industry's standards consortium.  Cadence is a relatively new product, one which will allow investors to participate with investments as small as $500 in fairly short-term, high-yield commercial debt instruments. It has been in private beta since January.  All of Cadence's issuances are viewable under the ticker symbol CDGRP in the terminal, not to mention the ethereum blockchain. Chu said:  ""We’re creating a level of transparency and efficiency that has simply never been possible before.""

The new feature was made available by integrating Wyre into Button Wallet and allows users to get verified and purchase cryptocurrencies with a debit card within an hours time. The CEO of Button Wallet, Alex Safonov commented on the feature's launch saying: “Letting users buy-in with fiat just as quickly and easily will only make crypto even more appealing and accessible for more people. They will be able to trade BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC, LTC, Waves, Dai and ERC-20 tokens without external fees, and will be able to pay friends and clients alike for everything from freelance gigs to split Coachella expenses.” Developed by Button Blockchain technologies in 2018, Button Wallet is a messenger-based software solution for microtransaction that allows users to send cryptocurrencies using Telegram usernames. Now, you may have heard of the Wyre exchange which offers crypto-to-fiat and compliance solutions through API and dashboard said the partnership with Button Wallet reflects its commitment “to help lower the barriers to entry for crypto platforms by offering our partners compliant ports into a regulated fiat world.” In a blog post, the firm said: “The simpler and safer these financial products become, the more people will be able to experience the benefits of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.” Safonov says the global digital transactions are estimated to top up to $6 trillion by 2022, an opportunity for cryptocurrencies to see a mainstream audience as long as pain points can be resolved. Safonov has said, “too often, buying cryptocurrency can be confusing for users. Sometimes it can take up to three weeks to be verified for a new user to purchase crypto with fiat within the US.” “By placing our wallet directly in the popular Telegram app — something we think all finance apps will do in the next two or three years — we believe we can help more people enjoy the benefits of cryptocurrency and decentralization.”",POSITIVE,BCH | BTC | ETC,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETC | FIAT,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/button-wallet-to-allow-users-to-buy-in-with-fiat,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284695.jpeg

Lucid Sight announced Tuesday that it has signed a deal with CBS to introduce the iconic starships from the popular TV and film franchise into a digital universe through its space-based game CSC later this year.  Players of CSC, for a limited time, will be able to buy the starships, including the U.S.S. Enterprise, which will be sold as unique digital collectibles.  ""'Star Trek' inspired me at a young age to pursue a career in technology, it is such a privilege to get the chance to bring 'Star Trek' into a new frontier with the first blockchain U.S.S. Enterprise,"" said Lucid Sight CTO and co-founder Fazri Zubair.  All of the spaceships sold in CSC will be secured as tokens on the ethereum blockchain and uniquely numbered based on the order of creation. The collectible items will be playable in the CSC game universe utilizing the ERC-721 standard – which allows the creation of unique or non-fungible tokens – to be fully tradable in-game or outside of CSC in third-party marketplaces such as Open Sea.  CSC is an open-universe game where players command starships to mine, harvest and craft items on ethereum, allowing CSC to provide ""proveable, transferable, transparent and delegated control"" of its in-game assets, Lucid Sight said.  In related news, ""Star Trek"" acting legend William Shatner last month announced he was partnering with Mattereum, a legaltech firm headed by former ethereum launch coordinator Vinay Gupta, to highlight its Asset Passport technology, which uses “legally-binding” smart contracts to record the authenticity of real-world collectible items.

The Times of India reported  Monday that police in the city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, had received complaints that the promoter, Divyesh Darji, had been offering investors investment in a token called Regal Coin, claiming a possible 5,000-percent return.  Investigations by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Gujarat Police reportedly show that Darji established an investment platform called Regal Coin in September 2017. The investment scheme promised that for every $2 put in, investors would earn $100.  Darji also reportedly promised investors they could earn back their principal investment in 99 days and earn interest on their investment through robotic trading profit along with 1–1.6 percent in referral bonus every 11 days, the CID said.  Police found out about the scam after an alleged victim, identified as Vishal Savalia, reported to authorities that he’d lost 1.75 million Indian rupees ($25, 260) in Regal Coin. Savalia claimed he’d made the investment through Darji's daughter Dimki and assistant Ramdayal Purohit.  Regal Coin reportedly operated through an app, which Savalia downloaded on his mobile phone.  Aside from Savalia, two other investors came have filed complaints against Darji, saying they invested 1.05 million rupees ($15,000) and 1.75 million rupees ($25,260), respectively, in Regal Coin.  The victims said that, at its peak, the value of Regal Coin had reached $100. Regal Coin eventually closed shop after allegedly taking nearly INR 45 million ($650,000) from investors.  While Purohit has been arrested. Darji, his daughter Dimki, and another aide, Mehul Pacchigar, reportedly remain at large. All three suspects have been charged of violating the Gujarat Protection of Investors Deposit Act and The Prize Chit Money Circulation Scheme Banning Act, says The Times.  Darji was previously arrested in August of last year over his role at Bitconnect, which closed shop in January 2018 after enforcement actions from state-level U.S. regulators.  The Times  reported that, while Darji had been arrested at the Delhi airport on Aug. 18, 2018, he was released after posting bail with the Gujarat High Court last month.

The 28 year-old Sun will meet Buffett at Smith & Wollensky’s in Manhattan and has said he would invite seven crypto-industry leaders to join them.  “I’m a long-term believer (and certainly a big fan) of Buffett and his long-term value investing strategy” wrote Sun in a Medium post.  Before launching Tron in 2017, with an ICO that raised about $70 million, Sun was an early investor in Tesla and bitcoin while obtaining a Master’s degree at the University of Pennsylvania in 2013. A previous venture, Peiwo, saw Sun step into social media with a Vine-like app that connects users through 10-second audio samples.  “As some of you might know, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has said publicly he sees no ‘unique value’ in Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency,” Sun continued, “Yet, he has pointed to the potential in blockchain, the underlying technology behind all cryptocurrency. I look at the upcoming lunch with Buffett as an opportunity to seek mutual understanding and growth.”  Buffett has slammed cryptocurrency in the past -- calling it at one point “rat poison squared” -- and most recently at his annual shareholder’s meeting saying, wagering on bitcoin is like betting on zero or double-zero on a Las Vegas roulette wheel.  Though in a statement provided by his assistant, Buffett said “I’m delighted with the fact that Justin has won the lunch and am looking forward to meeting him and his friends. We are going to have a good time and Glide will use his contribution to help many thousands of people.”  The billionaire CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has hosted this auction since 2000, and has raised over $32 million for the Glide Foundation, which serves the homeless population and those battling addiction in San Francisco.  Last year’s winning bid was $3.3 million.
