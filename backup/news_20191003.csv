42382804,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9su7Z,1570140005,PayPal Might Withdraw From Libra Association: Report,"UPDATE (Oct. 4, 2019, 19:55 UTC): PayPal has formally withdrawn from the Libra Association, a spokesperson confirmed. Read more here.      One of the founding Libra Association members may be on the verge of pulling out.  The Financial Times reported Thursday  that payments firm PayPal is considering leaving the Facebook-initiated crypto project due in part to the regulatory backlash Libra has received in recent months.  According to the Financial Times, PayPal representatives did not attend a Libra Association meeting on Thursday, in what may be a sign of the broader turmoil.  Facebook first revealed Libra in June, unveiling a grand ambition of providing financial services to more than a billion unbanked individuals through a stablecoin accessible by any smartphone.  As part of its project, Libra will be overseen by a governing council of 100 members, including Facebook and its subsidiary Calibra. PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Uber and 22 other prominent payments and services firms were listed as founding members of the council, dubbed the Libra Association.  Dante Disparte, the Libra Association's head of policy and communications, told the FT in a statement also shared with CoinDesk that building a project like Libra ""is not an easy path.""  ""We recognise that change is hard, and that each organisation that started this journey will have to make its own assessment of risks and rewards of being committed to seeing through the change that Libra promises,"" he said.  Doubts  Thursday’s revelation follows a Wall Street Journal report that Visa and Mastercard are also considering withdrawing from the project. Like PayPal, it is possible that these companies are concerned that the regulatory backlash and scrutiny to Libra will extend to their current businesses as well.  Calibra CEO David Marcus, himself the former president of PayPal, addressed the Journal's report on Twitter, writing that he had ""no knowledge of specific organizations' plans to not step up.""  He added  :  ""The tone of some of this reporting suggests angst, etc... I can tell you that we're very calmly, and confidently working through the legitimate concerns that Libra has raised by bringing conversations about the value of digital currencies to the forefront.""  A spokesperson for PayPal did not immediately return a request for comment.

42382792,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9stwF,1570134620,Hackers Launch Widespread Botnet Attack on Crypto Wallets Using Cheap Russian Malware,"With millions of dollars of cryptocurrency stolen from crypto wallets every year, security researchers were surprised to find one active botnet being sold for about $160.  The bargain Trojan malware is called MasterMana Botnet, which uses mass mailing to send phishing emails with attachments containing malicious code to crypto investors. Once someone clicks on the email, the code will create backdoors on their computer to empty their wallets, according to a recent research conducted by Prevailion.  ""Based on what we've observed, the MasterMana Botnet had a global impact on organizations across a wide variety of verticals,"" Danny Adamitis, intelligence director at Prevailion, told CoinDesk.  ""We assess that the Botnet was interacting with approximately 2,000 machines a week, or 72,000 machines over the course of 2019, based on the snapshot we observed,"" Adamitis said.  The research saw references in the code that indicated the threat actors could have Trojanized a version for the major Microsoft file formats, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher.  Based upon exhibited tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), the researchers have associated it with the “Gorgon Group”, a notorious hacker collective active for numerous years that has been known for cybercrime and intelligence operations  “The cost for the threat actors to deploy and maintain the campaign was virtually nonexistent,” Prevailion said in the research report. The hackers would need to spend $60 on leasing a Virtual Private Server and $100 Trojan AZORult from Russia-based cyber-crime forums, Prevailion said.  The research suggested the cost for earlier attacks could have been cheaper as they used a similar Trojan called Revenge Rat which had been free through Sept. 15.  A higher-than-average success rate for such attacks depends on the version of the Trojan the hackers are using in the campaign.  “Based on the level of sophistication displayed in this campaign, we believe that the threat actors struck a sweet spot,” the report said.  In other words, the hackers stay under the radar by avoiding popular commodity malware such as Emotet, while using a slightly older Trojan that is still sophisticated enough to evade most security software detection.  According to the research, the campaign was still active as late as Sept. 24 and it suspects that this particular threat actor is likely to continue operations, as previous public reporting has not deterred them.  ""We recommend that cryptocurrency investors need to remain particularly vigilant in protecting their personal computer. Having two factor authentication, such as a hardware token is recommended when that option is available,"" Adamitis said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/03/hackers-launch-widespread-botnet-attack-on-crypto-wallets-using-cheap-russian-malware,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43d0ef82157ed77f82160cdd08f4825d1241caa0-2560x1752.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42382790,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9stsT,1570132848,Fed Official Says Digital Central Bank Currency Is 'Inevitable',"Philadelphia Federal Reserve bank president Patrick Harker said it is “inevitable” for the central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, to start issuing digital currency.  Speaking at a community banking conference in St. Louis, Harker argued that the U.S. should not be the first big country to issue a national coin, because technology is still maturing and the U.S. dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, according to a Reuters report.  “It is inevitable ... I think it is better for us to start getting our hands around it,” the Federal Reserve official said, answering a question about the Fed’s decision to create its own real-time payments system called FedNow.  Harker said:  “I am looking at the next five years after that. What comes next? I do think it is something around digital currency.”  Harker’s comment came amid a heated debate around the world over privately issued cryptocurrencies, fearing they would undermine a central bank's ability to lead effective monetary policies.  This week, executives from some of the biggest American banks complained to the Federal Reserve that Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra would pose as a monetary threat in the September Federal Advisory Council meeting.  “As consumers adopt Libra, more deposits could migrate onto the platform, effectively reducing liquidity, and that disintermediation may further expand into loan and investment services,” the executives said.  Many of the major economies in the world have started planning to have a national digital currency.  China’s crypto chief Mu Changchun said one of the main goals for the Chinese national stablecoin Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) is to preempt the rise of Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra even before it is launched.  “If we allow Libra come to the market, we would open the underground economic channels,” Mu explained. “It will be hard for China to manage foreign currencies and the $50,000 capital outflow cap would be less effective,” Mu said.  Agustin Carstens, chief of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said central banks will likely soon need to issue their own digital currencies.  BIS, known as a central bank for central banks in Europe, is supporting global central banks’ efforts to research and develop digital currencies based on national fiat currencies, Carstens said in an interview with the Financial Times.

42382797,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9su01,1570131027,Ohio Treasurer Suspends Predecessor's Bitcoin Tax Payment Service,"A website launched last year by the U.S. state of Ohio allowing businesses to pay a range of taxes with bitcoin has been taken offline.  Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague announced the decision to immediately suspend OhioCrypto.com on Wednesday at a meeting of the State Board of Deposit, according to an official announcement.  The reason for pulling the service – perhaps temporarily – comes down to how Ohio's third party crypto payments provider, BitPay, is defined under state law, Sprague said.  Sprague took on the mantle of state treasurer in January, since then his office has been ""reviewing the creation and operation"" of OhioCrypto.com. He now believes the payment method provided by BitPay constitutes a “financial transaction device” under Ohio law and has asked the state's Attorney General for a formal opinion on the matter.  The definition, if confirmed to apply to BitPay, means that the firm's services should have been chosen via a ""competitive selection process"" and approved by the State Board of Deposit.  Sprague said:  “It is vital that Ohio explores innovative, new technologies and processes that continue to drive Ohio into the future. However, we must make sure any new processes that are implemented, such as OhioCrypto.com, are established in accordance with Ohio law.”  The bitcoin tax service was launched last November by the state treasurer at the time, Josh Mandel, who'd previously expressed an interest in cryptocurrency. It enabled companies in the state to pay a variety of taxes, including tobacco sales tax, employee withholding tax and public utilities tax, with the cryptocurrency.  “Until a formal opinion is issued by the Attorney General, I feel it is prudent to suspend the website,” said Sprague, adding that fewer than 10 companies were paying taxes via the site.  Atlanta-based BitPay offers a service allowing merchants and other organizations to accept payments in cryptocurrencies and automatically converts these to fiat currency.

42382808,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9suBL,1570129255,MakerDAO Bounty Program Catches 'Critical' Bug Before Launch,"MakerDAO has patched a ""critical"" bug in its yet-to-be-launched Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) upgrade that could have put more than 10% of the system's total collateral at risk.  The bug was caught by HackerOne user lucash-dev, who reported it via the HackerOne forum and received a $50,000 bounty for uncovering the potentially devastating flaw.  ""Our auction system allowed the potential attacker to create a fake auction, basically offering very little collateral for a large amount of DAI,"" Chris Smith, a senior software engineer for MakerDAO, told CoinDesk. ""The system would trust that number and use it as credit against collateral in the system, allowing the hacker to basically take that other collateral out of the system.""  The bug could have devastated MakerDAO's planned MCD. Lucash-dev said in his report that it ""allows an attacker to steal ALL collateral stored in the MCD system during the liquidation phase – possibly within a single transaction.""  Lucash-dev told CoinDesk:  ""That would be disastrous if it ever happened in a live environment.""  But neither the bug nor the MCD upgrade host ever went live – it was caught during the testing phase, before any users had access to the system.  Both lucash-dev and MakerDAO engineers told CoinDesk that no user funds were ever placed at risk.  Under the new MCD, users will be able to stake cryptocurrencies other than ETH as collateral to issue new Dai. The value of these ""collateralized debt positions'' has to match the Dai in circulation as Dai is a representative currency – much like the US dollar was when it was backed by gold. Certain users can trigger a liquidation mode to balance out the system.  Lucash-dev told CoinDesk that the system had a fault:  ""The new Multi-collateral DAI contracts can enter a 'liquidation mode' – that means that everyone who own DAI will just collect the collateral tokens corresponding to their DAI stake. The bug allows an attacker to trick the system to give them any number of DAI (only during the liquidation mode), which can in turn be exchanged by all tokens held as collateral!""  The bug exploited MCD’s kick contract implementation that allowed users to post phony auctions, issue DAI, and then cash out collateral.  Wouter Kampmann, head of engineering for MakerDAO, said that bug tracking events like this were routine.  ""Its through processes like these that you get through the system and make sure that it's absolutely as secure as possible before you launch it.""  The bug was posted on August 28 and patched by September 26. Lucash-dev disclosed it to the public on October 1.

42382787,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9stpx,1570127424,Japan's Financial Regulator Issues Draft Guidelines for Funds Investing in Crypto,"Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) has issued draft guidelines for funds investing in crypto.  The Sept. 30 announcement, which mentions crypto assets in the introduction but only alludes to them in the text of the proposed amendment itself, is the latest move by the authorities in the country to prudently manage the development of the market without shutting it down.  ""It is anticipated that financial products that invest in crypto assets (virtual currency) will be formed in the future,"" the agency notes in the introduction to the proposed revisions to Supervision Guidelines. ""But there are also indications that investment in crypto assets is encouraging speculation. The agency believes that it should carefully handle the formation and sale of investment trusts that invest in such assets.""  The actual revisions are a bit more vague. They advise funds to exercise caution when investing in assets outside the original objective of the trust and to evaluate potential risks, such as those relating to volatility and liquidity. It refers to the worrying investments as ""non-specific assets.""  ""Special attention should be paid to the composition of such products,"" the amendment cautions.  ""In the revised bill, virtual currency is not mentioned,"" notes the Zaikei newspaper, though it reported on the revisions as dealing with crypto assets by referencing the introduction.  Public comments are being taken by the FSA on the revisions through the end of October.  The issuing of the draft comes in the context of movement on the regulatory front in Japan. The country was rocked by the collapse of Mt Gox in 2014 and the 2018 hack of the Coincheck exchange and has been working to reestablish the crypto market on a better footing. Since early 2018, the FSA has been fine-tuning the regulatory framework for exchanges and establishing a framework for crypto offerings, and in early 2019 amendments were proposed to Payment Services Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.  Progress is already evident. In the first half of 2019, the FSA approved three new exchanges after approving none in 2018. Last week, a self-regulatory organization (SRO) formed that will help guide the development of the market for security token offerings (STO), suggesting that the private sector is preparing for the new regulatory environment.

PARSIQ is a monitoring tool for compliance officers, market analysts, blockchain developers and researchers. The advance brings new business insights to the blockchain first proposed by MIT professor Silvio Micali, such as following transactions and tracking smart contracts in real time.  The addition makes it easier for users to get a ""broad view"" of the blockchain, from interpreting reams of data to tracking and analyzing movements on the network, Algorand CEO Steve Kokinos told CoinDesk. He called it a benefit for users seeking detailed analysis.  “There’s a need to both simplify experiences and also give people better information about network application performance, and we think the work PARSIQ is doing will be a great addition for people developing on the Algorand blockchain.”  “PARSIQ is allowing people to analyze these blockchains that are too big these days to be analyzed by any kind of normal tool,"" Tom Fry, PARSIQ spokesman, said.  He said PARSIQ addresses the growing complexity of ballooning blockchains, including Bitcoin’s 242 GB blockchain. “Right now, it's crazy, you can barely fit it on a hard drive,” Fry said of it.  Much of that functionality comes from PARSIQ's domain-specific language: ParsiQL.  ""We call it a data stream manipulation language,"" PARSIQ founder Andre Kalinowski said, adding that its applications help users track the blockchain in real-time.  Smart triggers – essentially an off-chain notification system for on-chain smart contracts – is one such tool. It gives users a customizable window into market movements and smart contract executions, alerting them when specified conditions are met, the white paper describes.  Algorand does not yet support smart contracts – the company said that it's building out that functionality now. But Kalinowski said that once it does, PARSIQ's smart triggers will be there to monitor them.  ""We will extend the monitoring to Algorand’s Smart Contract technology when it becomes available to the public. This will work in a similar way to how we monitor Ethereum Smart Contracts now, allowing triggers to be set up for Smart Contract events.”  Data image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/03/algorand-integrates-tech-to-bring-users-detailed-analysis-of-largest-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/189849c25110779e4d0753400ba1cb0379d592ea-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382788,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9strD,1570113617,Coinbase-Led Crypto Ratings Council Draws Skepticism From Legal Experts,"An initiative led by crypto exchanges to categorize digital assets has drawn mixed reactions from leading legal experts and industry players.  Coinbase  , Kraken, Bittrex and a number of other exchanges announced Monday that they were forming the Crypto Rating Council (CRC) to clarify whether cryptocurrencies are securities. The CRC uses a 1-5 rating scale, with 1 being a clear non-security (bitcoin, litecoin, dai), and 5 being clear securities (none of which were disclosed publicly) – at least in the eyes of the consortium.  A number of assets fell somewhere between 1 and 5, including XRP, maker, EOS, augur and ethereum.  Reactions to the plan have ranged from welcoming to derisive. While some have expressed optimism about the CRC as a concept, others have criticized how the rollout has been handled and whether the body will really serve to sway the minds of regulators.  “I think this is a great idea,” said Gary Goldsholle, a partner at law firm Steptoe and Johnson, who previously served as the Deputy Director of the Division of Trading and Markets at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He told CoinDesk that the council’s framework could benefit smaller issuers and platforms that don’t have sufficient resources to conduct the scale of analysis that the SEC requires.  “I know firsthand how rigorously the SEC reviews a digital asset to ascertain whether it is a security,” said Goldsholle, adding:  “That might lead to a situation where certain platforms have more information about certain assets than others do, which leads to an un-level playing field.”  Coinbase, the exchange leading the CRC, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But Coinbase chief legal officer Brian Brooks said on Twitter that the members are not providing legal advice.  “You can think of our efforts as the foundation for an automated compliance tool, of which there are many in the financial services world,” he wrote. He added that, while members of the group “do have an interest” in being able to list more assets, they won’t add blatant securities due to the potential for fines and other penalties.  Self-regulation?  Stephen Palley, a partner at Anderson Kill, told CoinDesk that the CRC’s self-regulatory move is not new.  “The concept of a self-regulatory organization [SRO] is neither novel nor a bad idea,” he said, citing FINRA and the NYSE. “But this isn’t an SRO and it raises a host of issues, including anti-competitive cartel concerns.”  Jalak Jobanputra, founder of Future Perfect VC, said self-regulation would have been a preferable approach for the crypto sector in its earliest days, “instead of inviting harsher regulation through the tolerance of bad actors.”  What’s unclear is how the SEC itself views self-regulation (the agency did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment). But Goldsholle, the former SEC staffer, was supportive of the idea.  “Having a centralized point of contact for the token issuer to provide all the necessary information seemed like a helpful structure,” he said.  Jobanputra said getting past the current legal uncertainty around digital assets was key to moving the industry forward. She went on to say:  “I believe tokenization is an important part of our future – and the sector will have to engage with regulators if that future is to be realized. Initiatives like this, if executed objectively, can help further the conversation and provide clarity.”  Yankun Guo, a partner at Yankun Guo Law, cautioned that, while the CRC might seem like a genuine attempt at self-regulation, the industry “should not rely on these ratings alone.""  These companies will still need to conduct their analysis of their products to ensure legal compliance. And, indeed, the CRC’s website notes that the ratings should be construed as advisory rather than definitive.  Transparency concerns  While conceptually the CRC’s goals may be laudable, its execution “leaves a lot of questions to be answered,” Jobanputra said.  “The CRC has not released specific weights and calculations that have led to the ratings they have released on their website so far. That leaves behind a question on how much subjectivity is in the ratings,” she told CoinDesk via email.  Guo echoed these concerns, saying it remains unclear what precisely a rating of 2, 3 or 4 actually means for a digital asset. She added:  “A 2, 3 or definitely a 4 means the digital assets has some characteristics of a security and therefore, should they all be classified as one?”  These intermediate rankings may not hold much significance, Palley said. It is unclear what a 3.5 means, for example, and a cryptocurrency either is or is not a security, making a sliding-scale categorization moot.  It is also unclear how precisely these ratings will be used by the consortium’s member exchanges as they deliberate whether to list an asset, or whether non-consortium members will be able to use the ratings in any way, Goldsholle noted.  Still, “it may start to create a common view as to the status of certain digital assets,” he said.  “I would eventually like to see more transparency into the analysis that led to the ratings,"" Goldsholle said, ""because I think that could be helpful for token issuers to understand how they can design their token or network to avoid being classified as a security.""  Coinbase's Brooks wrote Tuesday that  “assets that score less than 5 but more than 1 show some characteristics of a security, but not enough for most members to consider them to be securities under current law.”  But he did not provide any further clarity on how the framework is applied to create a score.  Legal implications  More seriously, Palley said the ratings could lead to the CRC and its members being named in lawsuits.  “I can see litigants asking for discovery of deliberative materials provided by outside counsel used to calculate the ratings,” he said, adding:  “It’s hard to see how those materials would be protected by privilege. Imagine a federal judge saying to a defendant ‘so … the CRC said FooToken was a 3.5? This means it was maybe probably a security? You decided to list it, though?’”  Guo said the framework may help the exchanges control the narrative around how assets are regulated. And it shows how exchanges are now willing to work together for their common good.  Goldsholle likes that the CRC will encourage issuers to provide greater information if they want the group to reassess their tokens.  But Palley was less charitable about the project, at least as currently constructed, saying:  “While I think I understand the motivation behind this, it’s half-baked as implemented and I doubt will stand the test of time without some significant revision.”  Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong image via CoinDesk archives",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | LTC | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/03/coinbase-led-crypto-ratings-council-draws-skepticism-from-legal-experts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd88581fe59f1dedf64b6a914bdd7040d4b42a0f-1500x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382801,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9su53,1570109409,Chainalysis Adds More ERC-20 Tokens to Crypto Sleuthing Service,"Blockchain investigations firm Chainalysis has added support for 10 more ERC-20 tokens, expanding the reach of its anti-money laundering tracking service.  New coins include Basic Attention Token (BAT), OmiseGO (OMG), Dai (DAI), Maker (MKR) and 0x (ZRX).  The additions bring Chainalysis' compliance, regulatory and tracking software – a favorite among federal investigators – to a larger swath of ERC-20 tokens. ERC-20 is crypto shorthand for “Ethereum Request for Comment” – a common set of rules governing tokens issued on the ethereum blockchain.  Chainalysis ""is a de-facto federal standard,” said Casey Bohn, a crypto-crimes specialist with the federally funded National White Collar Crime Center. “That’s what they seem to be using most” to analyze and track crypto transactions.  Jonathan Levin, Chainalysis' co-founder and chief strategy officer, said the additions help regulators trace illicit tokens – especially ERC-20 tokens on the ethereum network, which he said has become a popular hotbed for hackers to exploit.  In early 2019, hackers cleared out an estimated $16 million in ether and ERC-20 tokens from the now-defunct Cryptopia exchange.  ERC-20 tokens continue to gain popularity, putting pressure on exchanges to list them and increasing the chance bad actors try to steal them. This, Levin said, made the addition of ERC-20 tokens a priority.  Levin said:  ""As of this month, there are more than 216,000 ERC-20 tokens found on the Ethereum network. With many end users flocking to get involved, cryptocurrency businesses want to quickly meet this demand.""  The eagle-eyed AML software is popular among crypto exchanges facing stringent global money-laundering safeguards. Last week, U.S. exchange Bittrex began using Chainalysis KYT software to monitor suspicious transactions, joining Binance.  Chainalysis will double its crypto coverage by the end of the year. It plans on adding XRP, ZCash and Doge, among others.  Update: this article has been updated to reflect that 10 ERC-20 tokens have been added.

Executives from some of the biggest American banks told the Federal Reserve that Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra would pose a threat on monetary policies in the US, Bloomberg reported.  “Facebook is potentially creating a digital monetary ecosystem outside of sanctioned financial markets — or a ‘shadow banking’ system,” banks said, according to the minutes of this month’s Federal Advisory Council meeting obtained by the news agency.  “As consumers adopt Libra, more deposits could migrate onto the platform, effectively reducing liquidity, and that disintermediation may further expand into loan and investment services,” the report said.  Members of the council include chief executive officers Rene Jones of M&T Bank Corp., Beth Mooney of KeyCorp, and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America Corp, according to Bloomberg.  Meanwhile, as the c-suite bellowed, two U.S. lawmakers, Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) and Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.), echoed their concerns in a letter to the Fed, asking Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to consider creating a digital dollar.  In July, Powell said the Libra initiative raised “a lot of serious concerns,” including privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, and financial stability in his testimony about Libra in front of the congressional committee.  At that hearing, Senator Sherrod Brown from Ohio also questioned Facebook’s Libra creator David Marcus on whether the company is trustworthiness by listing a number of scandals ranging from Cambridge Analytica to racial massacres in Myanmar.  “Facebook should stop Libra plans,” Brown said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.  In France, finance minister Bruno Le Maire last month indicated that France will block Libra from Europe.  “I want to be absolutely clear: In these conditions, we cannot authorize the development of Libra on European soil.” the minister said at the opening of an OECD conference on blockchain and cryptocurrencies in Paris, France.

42382805,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9suA5,1570102391,Asset Manager Stone Ridge Files SEC Prospectus for Bitcoin Futures Fund,"Another bitcoin futures product is booting up, according to a Stone Ridge Asset Management filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The company filed a prospectus for a cash-settled bitcoin futures fund – dubbed the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund – with the regulator on Wednesday.  Based in New York City, Stone Ridge has some $15 billion in assets under management, serving clientele in both the United States and China. Founded in 2012, the firm offers portfolio management and advisory services.  One hundred thousand futures shares will be offered at $10 each, and have no minimum purchases. They will be limited to eligible investors as determined by Stone Ridge, the filing states.  The fund will not invest in bitcoin or other digital assets directly, but uses bitcoin as the underlying reference asset. To support the fund, Stone Ridge will purchase bitcoin futures to match the fund's total value one-to-one along with large amounts of cash, government securities, and business securities to maintain liquidity, provide collateral as well as leverage.  The prospectus urges caution while calling bitcoin a speculative asset:  “Bitcoin was developed within the last decade and, as a result, there is little data on its long-term investment potential.”  As a prospectus, the details outlined by Stone Ridge are liable to change.  Bitcoin-based financial products continue to hit the market, with physically-settled bitcoin futures platform Bakkt launched last week. While settling just over $5 million in its first week, the launch signaled the end of a regulatory gauntlet spanning more than a year.

42382810,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9suCb,1570100442,"Gold, Not Bitcoin, Is Drawing Haven Demand on US Recession Fears","Fears of a U.S. recession have resurfaced over the last two days and the resulting risk aversion is bringing a boost to gold. For bitcoin, though, it's a different story.  The U.S. Institute of Supply Management said Tuesday its manufacturing index fell to a 10-year low of 47.8 percent last month from 49.1 percent in August. A below-50 reading indicates contraction in manufacturing activity.  The gloomy data suggests a boosted risk of a recession in 2020, as seen in the chart below tweeted by popular analyst Holger Zschaepitz.  The threat of a recession has sent global equities lower. Notably, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 450 points in day two of a sell-off.  Meanwhile, gold has risen from $1,460 to $1,500 per ounce in the last 48 hours and is now looking to extend gains. The yellow metal, a classic safe haven asset, is clearly benefiting from the recession concerns and the resulting risk aversion.  Bitcoin, however, has been largely trapped in a $8,200–$8,500 range since Tuesday. In fact, the top cryptocurrency’s bounce from recent lows near $7,700 has run out of steam near the 200-day moving average (MA) resistance at $8,483 over the last 48 hours.  The lack of demand for bitcoin as a safe haven asset amid the economic worries appears to contradict the argument often put forward by many observers that the cryptocurrency is digital gold.  Many investors also consider BTC as a store of value and a hedge against the aggressive expansionary monetary policies adopted by the major central banks. The odds of Federal Reserve delivering 2019’s third interest rate cut in October have gone up from 40 to 64 percent over the last two days, according to CME’s FedWatch tool.  Even so, BTC is struggling to find bids. In fact, the cryptocurrency fell from $10,000 to $8,000 in September despite the European Central Bank’s decision to cut rates by 10 basis points to -0.50 percent.  These factors suggest BTC is yet to take over the role of a classic safe haven and remains a largely uncorrelated asset.  The situation may change in the future, though, if traditional investor participation in the cryptocurrency market increases. After all, BTC seems to have all the properties of haven assets. For instance, it is not linked to government currencies and is deflationary in nature, which gives it an innate value, like rare metals, as noted by Reuters.  As for the next 24 hours, the probability of BTC falling below $8,000 is high, as per the technical charts.  Daily and 4-hour charts  On Tuesday, bitcoin created a doji candle – a sign of indecision – at the 200-day moving average, aborting the corrective bounce from recent lows near $7,700.  A convincing move above the 200-day MA, currently at $8,483, would invite stronger buying pressure, as discussed earlier this week.  A break above the key average looks unlikely, however, as the 4-hour chart (above right) is reporting a failed double bottom breakout – Tuesday's move above the trendline was short-lived. The failed breakout indicates the sentiment is still quite bearish and validates the price-negative readings on the longer duration indicators.  The 4-hour chart relative strength index has fallen back below 50, indicating bearish conditions. As a result, a fall back to levels below $8,000 looks likely.  If the 200-day MA is breached, a quick move to$8,900 could be seen, as the daily chart MACD histogram is producing higher lows – a sign of weakening bearish momentum.  Overall, the outlook will remain bearish as long as prices are trading below $9,097.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The transaction was carried out on a platform provided by supply chain management firm Tradeshift and used ""programmable digital cash"" from ConsenSys-backed Monerium, according to an announcement from Tradeshift on Tuesday. Specifically, Nordic Store bought goods from IKEA and settled an e-invoice using Monerium's tokenised Icelandic krona.  Monerium and Tradeshift suggested the ""world's first"" transaction shows that ""government-regulated, programmable e-money is ready for mainstream markets.""  As reported in June, Reykjavik-based Monerium was licensed by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland (FME) as its first Electronic Money Institution, making the startup the first to have regulatory approval to provide fiat payment services over blockchain systems across the European Economic Area.  The Electronic Money Institution rules were set up originally for prepaid debit cards by the European Union after the 2008 financial crisis.  “With a ‘smart invoice’ we can issue tokens that represent the future cash flow down to each dollar on the invoice. Whoever holds tokens will get paid upon due date, which makes smart invoices ideal to use for financial-services apps,” said Gert Sylvest, co-founder of Tradeshift.  Tradeshift – which also created the ""smart invoice"" for the transaction – was notably backed by Goldman Sachs in a $250 million Series E funding round last May. The round valued the firm at at $1.1 billion and marked a deeper move into the blockchain industry by the firm.

Announced Wednesday, Mavixbtc Limited was ordered to halt operations after allegedly misleading investors. Mavixbtc faces civil penalties and investigation costs of over $30,000 for its fraudulent representation as a brokerage and investment company.  To garner customers, St. Louis-based Mavixbtc began offering investment services advertising returns of 55 percent “in as little as 6 days,” according to the secretary of state’s office.  The office also alleges:  “Mavixbtc falsely claims to be registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. The company also fraudulently uses the registration number of a registered investment adviser representative who has no knowledge of Mavixbtc.”  “The novelty and promise of quick profits by investing in cryptocurrencies can be enticing to investors,” Securities Commissioner David M. Minnick said.  “But there are significant, real risks associated with these non-traditional investments, and scam artists are hard at work trying to defraud investors. Always check with our office before you invest.”  The division offered Mavixbtc the opportunity to make a case for why restitution should not be imposed.  The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) launched the second wave of “Operation Cryptosweep,” an initiative to crack down on crypto related scams. As of August, 35 enforcement decisions have been taken and nearly 100 more are pending.

The questions include whether Libra will be an open platform for commerce, what currencies will be accepted and whether organizations or individuals who use the currency will get ""a special advantage.""  The comments were made in an interview with Denmark's Finansforbundet, picked up by Bloomberg.  “It’s a new thing that we’ve begun to ask questions about something that doesn’t yet exist,” Vestager said.  Despite these unknowns, Vestager is keeping an open mind to a range of potential outcomes at launch:  ""There may be a problem that you get a completely closed ecosystem that has nothing to do with the rest of the economy,"" she said, later adding, ""[Y]ou can do it in a way that is open to competition, in terms of the way you pay.""  The European Commission launched an investigation into the Libra Association’s potential anti-competitive behavior in August. The scope of the investigation includes the impact on users’ data and the integration of Libra into Facebook owned Whatsapp and Messenger.  “We want to be far enough ahead that we can say whether this will be a problem,” Vestager said. She noted the commission isn’t the only organization with questions of Libra, “It may be that our central banks will be most interested in it.”  Transparency has been a recent flashpoint in the public conversation surrounding Libra.  Yesterday, previously unheard-from Libra Association members expressed discontent over the regulatory scrutiny of the project. And it took a leaked transcript of a closed-door meeting to hear Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s thoughts on the firm's approach.

Fintech firm Amun and crypto fintech service Bitcoin Suisse announced Thursday the launch of its Swiss franc denominated Amun Bitcoin Suisse BTC/ETH exchange-traded product (ETP) under the ABBA ticker. Nine parts bitcoin and one part ether by percentage, the ETP captures some 75 percent of the total cryptocurrency market cap in one listed product.  In an interview, Amun CEO Hany Rashwan said the ETP serves as an important financial hedge. Based on the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap and denominated in Swiss francs, Rashwan said the product is uniquely Swiss.  “It’s the conservative Swiss way of doing things,” Rashwan told CoinDesk. “It’s safe, cheap, and conservative.”  Unlike exchange-traded notes (ETNs), ETPs are legally obligated to be backed one-to-one by reserves. Amun says the ETP is fully collateralized with bitcoin and ether custodied in Switzerland by Bitcoin Suisse. The firm's first ETP since its founding in 2013, Bitcoin Suisse currently holds some $1 billion.  The product follows Amun’s numerous other crypto-based ETPs launched this year, based on leading cryptocurrencies by volume traded such as bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and XRP.  Rashwan told CoinDesk the firm expects to have some $75 million in assets under management for this type of product's portfolio by the end of the year, spurred on by further product launches this coming quarter, including ETPs.

42382780,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9ssbD,1570075223,What Tezos and Bitcoin Have in Common,"The Tezos community has strong shared values, arguably as strong as bitcoin's.  That's the assessment of Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter, who said Tuesday:  ""The number one lesson and takeaway of bitcoin is a core set of principles – defining them and making the chain a beacon to attract people who believe in those principles.""  He made the comment at TQuorum, a conference about the Tezos ecosystem organized by the Tocqueville Group. While the bitcoin and Tezos communities have different values, Carter argued both groups are comparably well-defined.  Tezos was funded by one of the largest initial coin offerings (ICOs) of them all, and Carter has been an ICO skeptic.  ""But if you are going to do it, shoot for the moon and believe you are going to be able to create a new form of non-sovereign money,"" Carter said of the Tezos ICO, which he says is the only ICO he's participated in, adding:  ""You don't have enough advocates if it's concentrated in a small number of folks.”  ""There has to be a shared narrative,"" Alison Mangiero, the Tocqueville Group's president, told CoinDesk in an interview after the panel, explaining why her organization gathered leading members of the Tezos community for three days in New York.  Before the public conference began, Mangiero gathered some of the most active participants in the Tezos blockchain for a conversation about values. Some of the values her staff presented for discussion included open participation, token-holder-centricity, non-aggression, nuanced pragmatism and evolution (not revolution).  Culturally, Mangeiro noted that Tezos has been a very technical and academic project – one that has spent less time than others telling its story more broadly. However, there are developments happening now that could begin to interest outsiders.  She highlighted the fact that the Tezos answer to ERC-20 tokens has been built and its non-fungible token standard is coming soon as well.  Updates on bitcoin come more in the form of tools built for it rather than changes to the bitcoin software itself. One of the core values of bitcoin, of course, is the fact that it is very conservative. It changes slowly. It has a fixed monetary supply. It never rushes to shift the fundamentals.  Meanwhile, Tezos is built for change and these new features reflect that, Mangiero said. With formal verification built into the very protocol and its ability to be upgraded as its central feature, users who deploy new digital assets on Tezos have stronger safety and security assurances, she argued, adding:  ""It's like a public blockchain for adults.""  What's the consensus?  So does the community possess a clear idea about the value of Tezos?  On the TQuorum conference floor, CoinDesk found the idea of a protocol that can change with the times to be one that came up repeatedly.  In fact, one interviewee (who preferred to remain anonymous) told CoinDesk he went from being a Bitcoin Maximalist to becoming stressed by bitcoin's inability to change.  ""I see a lot of people coming into [Tezos] from bitcoin because we saw a lot of things that were broken in the previous system,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Maybe this [Tezos] was something we could settle on and grow?""  Lukas Zuegg, a hobbyist baker (the Tezos term for those responsible for block creation) who also teaches workshops on validating the blockchain, said Tezos bakers have enough of a shared commitment to participating in governance that they have no compunction about naming and shaming each other on social media for not voting. Token holders also show they share these values by quitting bakers who skip votes.  That kind of culture gives Tezos a reputation for being a well-governed blockchain.  Still, Zuegg noted it's small relative to other blockchains.  ""I think it's a challenge of managing bigger and bigger societies,"" Zuegg cautioned.  Adrian Brink, a founder at Tezos startup Cryptium Labs, concurred that the network's key feature is ""constant, steady evolution, to go with the times.""  But he also echoed Zuegg's point:  ""The community is still very young so it's fleshing out its ethos and its values.""
