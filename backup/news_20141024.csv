42377743,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NWB,1414190993,All Things Alt: The Internet of Block Chains and an Injunction Against Moolah,"The altcoin community has often been rocked by scandals and platform crises, and the past two weeks have been no exception.  Despite the controversies and occasional market panics, however, project development soldiers on, aspiring toward ever more lofty goals in the face of this adversity.  Emergency injunction granted against Moolah  The syscoin development team released a legal update in its ongoing battle for custody over the remainder of the 1,500 BTC it raised during a crowdsale managed by Moopay LTD, the embattled digital currency services company at the center of a scandal surrounding ex-CEO and alleged scam artist Alex Green.  Today, the syscoin team, represented by UK-based law firm Selachii LLP, was granted an emergency injunction against Moopay, also known as Moolah, by the High Court in London following an effort to resolve the situation out of court.    @moolah_io Mr Justice Hamblen in the High Court of Justice has granted an Injunction against you this evening A copy has been emailed to you      — Selachii LLP (@Selachii_LLP) October 24, 2014      Team manager and coder Dan Wasyluk said that the syscoin team will be seeking damages in their case against Moopay, in addition to the roughly 750 BTC that the company claims it is owed.  Wasyluk told CoinDesk:  “We observed activity this morning clearly indicating [Green] was moving BTC funds, funds which he claimed he had no access to. We passed on all relevant information to our counsel and an emergency injunction was granted by the High Court.”  Notably, the Moolah Twitter account posted a response to the legal action prior the injunction, suggesting that a response was being crafted. According to Wasyluk, no response has yet been received.  Wasyluk said that they have since reported Green to law enforcement agencies and anti-fraud groups, including Interpol. He added that he hopes that the situation can be resolved so that the development of syscoin can continue with the funds that it raised months ago.  “We are (as I think many others in the community are) tired of these scams happening every month,” he said.  Viacoin developer: The block chain is speech  The viacoin team recently released its block chain notary implementation, which enables cryptographically proofed timestamping to authorize the veracity of legal documents or contracts.  CoinDesk recently caught up with viacoin developer BTCDrak, who in conversation argued that the block chain should be looked at as a ledger of speech rather than a ledger of asset exchanges.  BTCDrak explained:  “The reason why people are saying that bitcoin is really speech is that the block chain is simply proof of publication. In bitcoin’s case, you’re publishing what are basically digitally signed checks, saying that Alice pays Bob, Bob pays Charlie, etc. There’s no actual asset in the block chain – it’s just a bunch of messages being published.”  On a conceptual basis, this is where the use case of the block chain for smart contract creation and documentation comes into play. BTCDrak said that the next step is the creation of a decentralized system for establishing identity and reputation, which he stated is a clear requisite for a functioning ecosystem in which no central authority exists to certify who is who.  BTCDrak also discussed the developmental strategy that he and viacoin advisor and Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd have adopted for viacoin. He said that the daily work being done on bitcoin is integrated into the viacoin network, and cited the wealth of knowledge available in the bitcoin development community as an asset for development on his altcoin project.  He added that other altcoin projects stand to benefit from adopting many of the fixes that core developers have instituted, particularly as much of the work is being done for free.  “It would be ludicrous for cryptocurrencies to not keep up to-date with upstream development,” he said.  XCurrency developer proposes ‘Internet of block chains’  The XCurrency development team is working on a digital currency superstructure called the BlockNet that’s designed to link the functionalities of multiple altcoin networks.  Dubbed the “Internet of blockchains”, the BlockNet will seek to allow for node-to-node communication across multiple block chains, essentially creating bridges between them over which different services can be rendered to users off of the block chain. The graph above details the infrastructure layers connecting coin networks and decentralized exchange services.  The infrastructure will include its own native asset, called blocks, which are set to be distributed in an initial token offering scheduled to begin on 29th October. Tokens can also be acquired during the operation of BlockNet nodes, according to the official Bitcoin Talk post. The offering will be hosted by several altcoin exchanges, including Bittrex, Bter, CoinGateWay and Poloniex.  A number of altcoins, including utilitycoin, swiftcoin, and apexcoin, among others, have voiced support for the project and will connect their networks to the infrastructure when launched.  Developer Dan Metcalf told CoinDesk that the project is aimed at creating an ecosystem in which coin projects can offer services to a broader audience, creating greater degrees of cooperation and opportunity than currently possible in a fractured and volatile market.  “The possibilities are endless from cloud storage to anonymous virtual private network (VPN) and beyond when deployed on the blocknet application platform‏,” he said.  Strange alt of the week  It’s been said that the altcoin developer represents the project as a whole, serving as both the public face for new updates and the leading voice against detractors.  In recent months, calls for a new direction in the altcoin community have resulted in several altcoin launches that claim to be breaking existing moulds for development by putting forward fresh ideas. Recent controversies surrounding both old and new coins have dampened hopes that such salvation is possible.  A recently announced project called nopecoin is staking its own claim to becoming the self-described “savior of alt coins[sic]”, pledging to “prevail where others have failed"".  The announcement post on Bitcoin Talk takes an unusually combative tone, earning nopecoin this week’s Strange Alt of the Week award.  A FAQ posted to the forum includes, as one might imagine, a long series of negative answers to common questions surrounding road maps, exchange listings and other speculative angles. With a planned max supply of roughly 20 million coins, this X11-algorithm proof-of-stake sports a 13% interest rate.  The nopecoin development team declared that its efforts are necessary within the altcoin community, saying:  “Seriously though nopecoin is saying Nope to all the BS that has clogged up the alt coin process. We are the plunger and here to unclog the toilet that everyone swims in right now.”  Images via Shutterstock, Bitcoin Talk, XCurrency  Have a tip about a notable happening in the altcoin world?

42377723,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73N8H,1414185059,Bitcoin Exchange Cryptsy Faces Lawsuit Over Customer Account Breach,"A Florida law firm is pressing charges against digital currency exchange Cryptsy, accusing the company of fraudulent business practices and negligent security measures.  In court documents filed in the 15th Judicial Court of Florida yesterday, Silver Law Firm stated that Cryptsy violated the state's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act by failing to provide critical information regarding security risks and customer fund management protocols.  Plaintiff and Cryptsy customer Skye Bonow, according to the filing, lost 140 BTC in January due to a security breach stemming from the undisclosed issues. Cryptsy has dismissed the charges in an official statement as unwarranted and driven by ulterior motives.  The court action against Cryptsy represents yet another legal battle in the digital currency space. Companies like Mt Gox, Butterfly Labs, CoinTerra and KnCMiner, among others, have all been targeted by civil or criminal suits in the past year. Silver Law is litigating a separate case against the operators of Bitcoin Savings & Trust, a bitcoin investment startup that was later shut down by US authorities when it was revealed to be a ponzi scheme.  Counsel David Silver accused Cryptsy of failing to uphold its obligations to its customers by not correctly managing their funds, saying:  “This is like the client walking into a bank on a Monday morning with a statement from the bank saying he has 150 BTC, and asking to withdraw that bitcoin, and the bank saying that someone took that money this morning and we have no responsibility for it.”  Suit alleges fraud front  The court documents state that, under Florida law, consumer-facing businesses are responsible for both providing meaningful protections if they handle funds and being transparent about any potential risks or dangers involved with using a service.  According to the suit, Cryptsy withheld information about security risks, how funds were stored and problems arising from internal development. Cryptsy was also accused of not providing details to customers about third parties that were involved with the exchange service.  The document continues:  “As a result of Defendants’ deceptive trade practices, Plaintiff was deceived into transferring bitcoin to Defendants, deceived into believing that Plaintiff’s assets were safe; and deceived into maintaining assets with Defendants when Plaintiff would have otherwise been able to protect and preserve his assets – thus causing significant economic damage to Plaintiff.”  The suit also alleges that Cryptsy intentionally misled customers by not providing this information and misrepresenting certain elements of the company. This, according to Silver, convinced customers like Bonow to use a service that they did not fully understand.  Cryptsy dismisses suit as PR stunt  In an official statement, Cryptsy said the lawsuit is without merit and that it will challenge the charges in court. The company said that Bonow’s computer was the source of the hack, meaning that there is little the exchange can do to address the stolen bitcoins.  CEO Paul Vernon said on the company blog:  “The complaint alleges that Cryptsy misled users and was negligent in security. They represent a single user. We have reviewed the unofficial complaint and believe that it is without merit. We intend to defend the case vigorously.”  The blog post included a list of security steps that customers should take prior to using the platform that can help avoid similar situations, including the use of two-factor authentication. Vernon also noted that, according to the site's terms of agreement, disputes are supposed to be settled via arbitration.  Vernon later told CoinDesk that he believes the suit’s legal representation is driven by financial motives, saying: “Our legal team tells us that they are likely just trying to get us to settle by pushing out a large PR campaign about it.”    Silver Law Complaint Against Bitcoin Exchange Cryptsy    Image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/24/bitcoin-exchange-cryptsy-faces-lawsuit-over-customer-account-breach,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfa817dc9a635e9090728b2aedc7312adf835835-2560x1702.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377731,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NH5,1414180556,Bitcoin Loan Platform BitLendingClub Receives €200K Seed Investment,"Bitcoin crowd-lending platform BitLendingClub has just announced a €200,000 ($253,336) seed investment from European VC fund LAUNCHub.  The Bulgaria-based company says the funding round will help the company expand and allow it to establish new headquarters in San Francisco.  BitLendingClub  ’s co-founder and CEO Kiril Gantchev told CoinDesk:  “The funding is an extremely important milestone for BitLendingClub. It has allowed us to validate our idea and to increase our efforts in the development of our platform.”  LAUNCHub  is a seed fund, based in Bulgaria, that invests in Southeast and Central European digital startups. Since 2012, the fund has invested and committed nearly €3.5m in 47 portfolio companies from nine countries in the region.  Bitcoin lending platform  BitLendingClub provides a peer-to-peer platform that brings bitcoin lenders and borrowers together. Using a 'Dutch auction' system, loans are offered and only accepted by borrowers when the interest rate drops low enough to match their requirements.  Borrowers can suggest interest rates they would prefer and can reject individual offers. This, the company said, guarantees that they will always get the best interest rate offered by the market. The average interest rate displayed on the firm's website is currently 17.62%.  In order to avoid loan defaults, BitLendingClub has partnered with a third-party document verification provider, Jumio, to validate borrowers’ verification documents.  Since the launch in May, BitLendingClub has served over 2,200 loans, amounting to over 3,500 BTC (around $1.25m at today's exchange rate), according to figures provided by the company.  BitLendingClub is not alone in the bitcoin lending space, other companies like BTCJam offer a similar service. The website of that company claims lenders can earn 19.3% APR on their bitcoin.  Boost for the community  Gantchev described the seed round as an extremely positive development, not just for his company, but for the bitcoin community in Eastern Europe.  “We're one of a handful of startups with a presence in the area that have received funding from a local seed fund,” he said. “The addition of BitLendingClub to the space clearly signals a strong interest in the region.”  Gantchev believes that bitcoin provides a major opportunity for developers to move out of the more traditional tech outsourcing industry in the region and start building their own products.  “Product ownership leads to more innovation,” he said, “so we're extremely excited for the future of bitcoin in the area. We're also thankful that LAUNCHub is also taking a leadership position, when it comes to funding bitcoin related startups.”  Euros image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/24/bitcoin-loan-platform-bitlendingclub-receives-200k-seed-investment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/440ac53862884054bcdc28a9a7ca9917467e29de-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377733,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NJb,1414173910,Spondoolies-Tech Takes Aim at BitFury With $5 Million Funding Round,"Spondoolies-Tech has raised $5m from a pool of both new and existing investors as part of its ongoing Series B funding round.  Participants in the round included Agile Wings, BRM Group and Genesis Partners, as well as a group of angel investors that featured entrepreneur Olivier Janssens and Aleph partner Eden Shochat.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Spondoolies-Tech CEO Guy Corem indicated that his company intends to use the funds to fuel its third-, fourth- and fifth-generation ASIC development and rival what it views as its main international competitor, BitFury.  Corem seeks to portray Spondoolies-Tech as more welcoming to the Western world than its larger competitor, who he criticizes for basing its mining center operations in regions that could lead the industry to perhaps be portrayed in a less favorable light.  Corem told CoinDesk:  ""We consider ourself part of the Western world and we think we have the technology to beat BitFury and the other players in this field.""  The Israel-based bitcoin mining manufacturing firm is one of the oldest in the industry, having raised its first round of venture funding in August 2013. Spondoolies-Tech has so far maintained its reputation in a sector of the industry that has been increasingly categorized by customer complaints and legal action.  This reputation was evoked by Janssens, who said that he believes Spondoolies-Tech has the necessary tools to succeed long term.  ""I am convinced they will be one of the few players that will remain, when the mining hardware consolidation takes place over the next years,"" he said.  The latest funding brings Spondoolies-Tech's total to-date funding to $11m. BitFury, by comparison, has raised $40m in two funding rounds this year.  Powering 30% of the network  With the new funding, Corem is also setting ambitious goals for his company and its upcoming round of new equipment.  ""Our goal is to get to 0.05 W/GHs, 0.03 $/GHs miners by mid 2015 and power more than 30% of the bitcoin network,"" Corem explained, adding that he believes these figures will help the company match its rival firms in the US and China.  Spondoolies-Tech is looking to release a 28nm ASIC, as well as two custom 16nm ASICs, by the second half of 2015, the total costs of which will be north of $7m, he estimated.  Corem went on to cite custom design on the transistor level of its chips as a key feature that would allow the company to reduce the power consumption and overall cost associated with its offerings.  ""We will be the leader in terms of power efficiency,"" he added.  International partners needed  Corem said that the funding will also help Spondoolies-Tech reach out to new partners that can help it grow its operations worldwide, as it is currently conducting its own mining operation on a limited scale.  According to Corem, the company is aiming to emulate the distributed model evoked by US-based MegaBigPower earlier this year, which allows interested entreprenuers to open up mining facilities under its franchise model.  ""We don't want to actively operate the mine,"" Corem explained. ""We would provide a guidebook with what needs to be done to create a facility in a way that will allow the customer to use our various generations and split profit off it.""  These partnerships, Corem suggested, may prove essential given that Spondoolies-Tech's customer base increasingly consists of enterprise-level clients.  Corem estimates that less than 20% of his company's sales are direct to consumers, a figure that suggests the recent rise of industrial-scale mining is having an impact on this market.

42377730,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NIL,1414169157,Regulated Gambling Platform Cozy Games Accepts Bitcoin in Industry First,"Cryptocurrency payment processor GoCoin has teamed up with iGaming operator Cozy Games to deliver bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin payments on its platform.  The companies said the move will make Cozy Games the first regulated iGaming operator in the world to accept cryptocurrencies.  GoCoin  said recent gambling tax reforms, such as UK's proposed Point of Consumption Tax (POC), have forced gaming sites to actively seek lower cost payment alternatives. Digital currencies are one such option and they could help gaming platforms improve their margins.  Lower cost alternative  GoCoin said Cozy Games will enjoy ""a dramatic reduction"" in transaction costs, chargebacks and cross-border fees. The company also pointed out that its e-commerce platform is designed to process cryptocurrency transactions for international gaming operators considered ""high risk"" by traditional payment networks.  ""By accepting cryptocurrencies through the GoCoin payment platform, regulated online gambling operators can engage new markets like the underbanked that are historically difficult to reach,"" said Steve Beauregard, co-founder and CEO of GoCoin.  Beauregard added that GoCoin is actively working with regulators to provide clear guidelines that guarantee privacy without violating the law.  Handling potential cryptocurrency issues  GoCoin stressed that Cozy Games, and indeed other potential clients, do not have to worry about security, volatility or complexity of handling digital currency directly. The platform insulates merchants from these risks by allowing them to settle transactions in the currency of their choosing. All risks associated with digital currency are effectively outsourced to GoCoin.  GoCoin integrates its Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures with the operator's platform, thus ensuring that each player can be identified, while at the same time guaranteeing privacy.  Sreeram Reddy, CEO of Cozy Games, explained:  ""GoCoin's solution is adaptable and compliant with Internet gaming law, allowing us to safely adopt the latest payment innovations while focusing on our core strength of delivering an excellent online experience for our players.""  Reddy described GoCoin as the frontrunner in bringing cryptocurrency expertise to regulated iGaming platforms, which is why Cozy Games decided to choose the company's crypto payment platform.  Bitcoin gaming still holds promise  Cozy Games currently operates more than 90 different games, which is quite a bit more than most bitcoin gambling sites. However, unlike most bitcoin gaming sites, it is not new – the company was founded in 2005 and already has an extensive user base.  GoCoin pointed out that gambling currently accounts for approximately half of all bitcoin transactions. However, it should be noted that most of these transactions are small, so they account for about 5% of total transaction value.  The idea of using bitcoin for gambling is anything but new, but although the concept looks promising on paper, it has not taken off just yet.  One of the earliest bitcoin gambling sites – and arguably the first truly popular crypto gaming site – was SatoshiDice, created by Eric Voorhees. Over the past few years SatoshiDice was joined by Seals with Clubs, SatoshiBet.com, Cloudbet and many others.  Now a big, regulated gaming operator can be added to the list of crypto-friendly gambling sites.

42377724,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NAn,1414160818,Butterfly Labs Urges Court to Dismiss FTC's 'Self-Serving' Fraud Charges,"Embattled mining hardware company Butterfly Labs has filed a motion to dismiss a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint against the company.  Butterfly Labs  (BFL) was shut down by the FTC last month following numerous claims of public misrepresentation and downright fraud.  However, in spite of nearly 300 customer filings against the company, BFL still insists it is the victim of overzealous regulators and intends to resume limited operations in the near future.  The sentiment is evident in the opening remarks of the latest filing, in which the company alleges the FTC headed a ""campaign to destroy"" BFL, following an ""ask questions later"" script. The company says the FTC created a ""legal morass"" by selectively using ""self-serving"" evidence.  See the full legal document at the bottom of this article.  Evidence challenged  The filing challenges evidence used in the case and accuses the FTC of lacking even basic information about the company, thus ""depriving the court of an accurate and factual background"".  ""Plaintiff could have learned (if it didn’t already know), for example ... that BF Labs voluntarily ended its preorder sales on July 17, 2014 (rendering much of the prospective relief sought by Plaintiff moot),"" the company stated in the filing.  Other evidence is disputed as well, such certain customer complains, claims about the volume of BFL shipments, previous complaints filed against the company and the FTC's media claims about the company, in which Butterfly Labs was described as a ""bogus company of scammers.""  The company pointed to the FTC's own decisions as proof that such characterisations made no sense:  ""The same day that Plaintiff issued its press release calling BFL a 'bogus' company of 'scammers,' two of Plaintiff’s attorneys held a Twitter-feed Q&A session about the BFL case. In that session, the attorneys stated that BFL took 'at least $20 million, and potentially up to $50 million' from customers, and stated that 'thousands of orders were placed, and thousands of consumers have complained about non-delivery.' Yet six days later, Plaintiff agreed to permit BF Labs, the 'operation' that Plaintiff proclaimed to the world (and this Court) had taken between $20 and $50 million from thousands of customers, to reopen for limited operations.""  Delays 'have precedent'  BFL went on to note that its ""anticipated shipping dates"" were not a misrepresentation of the facts, because no reasonable bitcoin-mining consumer could have concluded that anticipated shipping date and product development representations made by the company were either material or misleading.  BFL argued that reasonable investors should have anticipated possible delays or unforeseen product developments, citing several precedents involving tech companies. The company maintained that it merely disclosed the status of products under development and that its ""shipping date and product development representations were immaterial and not misleading as a matter of law"".  BFL went on to list a number of revisions, updates and blog posts in which it communicated the delays to its customers and the general public.  The company also criticised the FTC's decision to cite the use of a third-party bitcoin calculator on the BFL site, as the FTC failed to note that the output of the calculator was dependant on the value of bitcoin and the shipping date.  In its conclusion, the BFL legal team requests that the court ""dismiss the complaint in its entirety and with prejudice"".

42398020,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFAXu,1414154617,This Polish Hospital Will Let Patients Settle Bills With Bitcoin,"A private hospital in Warsaw, Poland, which is run by the Medicover Group, will soon let patients pay their bills in bitcoin. A bitcoin ATM planned to be launched at the facility in the near future should make that process even easier.  While a number of clinics and doctors around the world have been accepting bitcoins for minor treatments and consultations, the medical facility is the first to accept payments for a wide range of healthcare services, including major surgery, the chain said.  Medicover  says its flagship outlet in Poland’s capital treats more than 8,000 international patients from over 20 countries worldwide.  Marcelina Szyszka, a staff member who was involved in the bitcoin integration, told CoinDesk that currently, the bitcoin payment service will be provided solely at the group's hospital in Warsaw's Wilanow district. However, if the service proves to be popular, they would likely extend it to other Medicover centres.  She said:  ""Our IT team is currently setting up a payment platform which will be used by Medicover Hospital. In the future, we will also launch a bitcoin ATM at the hospital.""  Bitcoin price list  Tucson Dunn, director of the Hospital Division at Medicover Group, said that the chain places an emphasis on ensuring a transparent pricing policy for its existing and potential patients.  “What makes Medicover Hospital special in the new realm of bitcoin healthcare is that the hospital has a published bitcoin price list for every type of care,” Dunn said, adding:  “We led the development of the International Diagnosis Resource Grouping (DRG) price list which was adopted by the International Healthcare Commission. The iDRG price list is the most widely accepted international price list in the world, accepted by over 100 insurance companies worldwide.”  Working in collaboration with Szyszka, Dunn says he converted the International DRG price list to a bitcoin price list, dubbed the 'BTC-DRG' price list, making it the first international bitcoin healthcare price list.  Extensive coverage  Medicover is one of the leading healthcare companies active in the region of Central and Eastern Europe. Set up in 1993, the group is present in 10 of the region’s countries, including Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Romania, Ukraine and Bulgaria, as well as in Germany, Turkey and Georgia.  In Poland, the group operates 30 healthcare facilities, of which nine are located in Warsaw, with a combined workforce of 1,400 doctors and 500,000 registered patients in its database. The group’s flagship outlet in the Polish capital has medical staff consisting of 170 doctors, 80 nurses and 20 radiology and ultrasound technicians.  The Warsaw-based hospital's divisions include women's health, obstetrics, children's health, cardiology, internal medicine, surgery, as well as anaesthesiology and intensive care, providing a wide range of healthcare services, according to Medicover.  The outlet says it has been cooperating with Poland’s state-run National Health Fund since 2011, enabling it to provide certain hospital services to patients covered by public health insurance.
