42427280,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1B9h,1484866513,Bitcoin Prices Spike Above $900 But Turbulence Remains,"Bitcoin prices passed $900 today, though this feat was diminished by several rallies that ultimately failed to push its value above this benchmark.  Overall, the digital currency rose to as much as $904.76, after falling below $880 earlier in the session, climbing above this level amid modest volatility.  Later in the session, the price mounted another comeback, hitting a high just above $905, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). At press time, however, the price had dipped again to a value of $894.95.  This upward movement represented the latest session of relatively mild price volatility, at least compared to the sharp price fluctuations experienced earlier this month.  Most notable, however, about the day's trading, may have been the lack of any serious decline over the day's trading.  Bitcoin prices enjoyed their latest climb in spite of new Chinese regulatory developments that found the nation’s exchanges responding publicly to pressures from the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank.  Bullish sentiment  Still, market sentiment has been bullish, according to figures provided by a handful of exchanges, even with the confirmation that major Chinese exchanges Huobi and OKCoin had stopped offering margin trading.  The market was 91% long on 19th January, Whaleclub figures reveal.  In addition, more than 53% of Bitfinex orders that were executed in the 24 hours through 22:15 UTC were buy ordershttps://www.bfxdata.com/orderbooks/btcusd, according to BFX Data.

42427283,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1BHh,1484859610,Trump's 'Acting' CFTC Chair Details Vision for Blockchain Regulation,"Donald Trump hasn't even formally appointed CFTC commissioner Chris Giancarlo as chairman yet, and he's already appropriated the president-elect's slogan: ""Making Market Reform Work for America.""  In comments given to about 300 swaps traders, analysts and more at the SEFCON event in New York City this week, Giancarlo for the first time referred to himself in public as ""acting chairman"" and laid out his ""agenda"" going forward for the regulation of blockchain and distributed ledger tech.  Reading from a prepared speech, the current CFTC commissioner yesterday reiterated his five-point plan for regulators to promote the technology, adding that if implemented successfully, he believes DLT could make regulatory compliance easier – even if Trump has plans to remove the control altogether.  Giancarlo said:  ""DLT may allow market participants to manage the enormous operational, transactional and capital complexities brought about by Dodd-Frank. At the same time, it may provide regulators with the market visibility necessary to fulfill our mission to oversee healthy financial markets.""  To accomplish this, Giancarlo expanded on his plans as first outlined in May for regulators to ""promote"" DLT and other financial technology.  Specifically, he said regulators need to designate ""savvy"" teams to work with FinTech companies, create safe environments for innovators to experiment, ""participate directly"" to help build proofs-of-concept and collaborate with both local innovators and international regulators to minimize overlap.  Call for cooperation  And Giancarlo’s America-centric slogan doesn’t appear to come at the expense of cooperation.  In fact, as he argued, the CFTC needs to collaborate with other US financial regulators to ""emulate"" work being done in the UK, Australia, Singapore and Japan ""to avoid stifling innovation and DLT's potential benefits"".  The DLT plan was part of five ""elements"" Giancarlo said would help make market reform work for America. These included providing customer choice in trade execution, fixing swaps data reporting, making the regulatory culture more progressive and encouraging FinTech innovation (the category that included his DLT plans).  Not only did Giancarlo indicate that distributed ledger technology could make Dodd-Frank compliance easier if successfully implemented, but he said it might actually strengthen the job market.  ""Making market reform work for America,"" said Giancarlo, ""means fostering FinTech innovation for the health and betterment of US financial and capital markets, market participants and the American jobs they support.""  Audience reaction  The reaction among audience members to Giancarlo's speech was largely positive, though skepticism remains regarding whether the cost of implementing DLT might be worth the potential benefits.  For instance, Kevin McPartland, head of research at Greenwich Associates, said he doesn't expect much change to happen for the first year that Giancarlo is in charge of the CFTC, assuming Trump formalizes the appointment.  Instead, McPartland thinks there will initially be even less change to regulatory considerations, as planned modifications are tabled and the new chairman works to replace a depleted array of commissioners.  However, once the new team has its footing, McPartland believes Giancarlo would likely align his blockchain controls with Trump's policies.  McPartland described the impact on regulation to CoinDesk:  ""I’m not sure it will be better or worse, just a little bit different. If there is a more hands-off approach taken by financial regulators, that should allow the industry to more freely innovate and move forward as opposed to spending so much time and money on compliance.""  Micah Green, partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP and co-chair of the law firm’s government affairs and public policy group, largely echoed McPartland’s stance that Giancarlo would likely give the industry a light touch on regulation.  According to Green, Giancarlo will likely increase the interaction between regulators, technologists and market professionals to help ensure what is being built is compliant from the day it goes live, but without hindering its possible applications in diverse sectors.  ""I think what you hear out of Mr. Giancarlo is, 'Let's see if that can be used,'"" said Green. ""Because it can be very efficient, from the market standpoint, it can be very cost efficient from the market standpoint, and reducing cost is very important.""  Conflicting views  Optimism aside, the future might not be smooth sailing.  As the Financial Times reported yesterday, Giancarlo’s embrace of the Dodd-Frank act – and the potential benefits blockchain could have on making compliance easier – puts him in direct opposition to Trump.  During Trump's presidential campaign he promised to ""dismantle"" the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory overhaul put in place after the financial collapse of 2008 as part of a bid to help increase industry oversight. It would appear that Trump might have no interest at all in Giancarlo's belief that blockchain could simplify compliance.  Larry Tabb, industry analyst and founder of Tabb Group, told CoinDesk that even if a blockchain solution was feasible – and useful – it might not save enough money to be worth implementing.  ""The amount of work just to get it into production is just so high,"" said Tabb. ""Let’s just say we spend $100m building out a platform. Each of those firms have to spend that to implement it. You’re talking about billions and billions of dollars just to retrofit stuff that works today.""  Regardless of what the future might eventually bring, however, Giancarlo reiterated his goal for the speech was to make explicit his plans going forward.  Giancarlo said:  ""In my work as acting chairman – and, if I am honored to be nominated and confirmed by the Senate as CFTC Chairman, my priorities should come as no surprise. These priorities are part of an agenda I like to call 'Making Market Reform Work for America.'""

42427262,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Afh,1484841638,FINRA Believes Blockchain Could Impact its Regulatory Rules,"FINRA believes the widespread use of blockchain could come to impact its core business practices.  The self-regulatory organization for US brokers published a new report on blockchain tech yesterday that offers both a broad overview of the tech from the context of its industry, as well as its take on its potential impact on the brokerage sector. FINRA has been open about its work on the technology (in conjunction with its members) in the past, though the release constitutes some of its most direct comments to date.  Most notably, FINRA said that, should the tech see broader use in the financial system, its own rules may need to be modified or changed.  As the report states:  ""Many FINRA rules as well as some rules implemented by other regulators (such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)), that FINRA is responsible for examining or enforcing with respect to broker-dealers, are potentially implicated by various DLT applications.""  Specifically, the tech could affect how FINRA members self-regulate in the areas of AML/KYC, asset verification, business continuity, surveillance and payments, among others.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, recordkeeping rules may also be turned on their head.  ""For example, a DLT application that seeks to alter clearing arrangements or serve as a source of recordkeeping by broker-dealers may implicate FINRA's rules related to carrying agreements and books and records requirements,"" the report’s authors note.  The report goes on to give a high-level overview of the impact of DLT in the debt and derivatives market, as well as explanations of how various industry stakeholders are experimenting with the technology.

Dubbed ‘Cello’, the project is intended to establish a means for “creating, managing, and terminating blockchains”, Hyperledger said this week. Cello will ultimately come to serve as a support mechanism for other projects included under the Hyperledger umbrella, including Fabric, Iroha, and Sawtooth Lake, among others.  Those behind the project say they hope it spurs partnerships with others working within the Hyperledger ecosystem.  Baohua Yang, who first proposed Cello on the Hyperledger mailing list back in June, said of the release:  “Cello will definitely welcome potential collaborations with other important projects, to achieve another open-source success.”  The official entry of Cello signals a strong start to 2017 for Hyperledger, which brought more than 100 members into the organization over the course of last year. The close of 2016 also saw Hyperledger look to expand its footprint in China and expand the scope of testing amongst its members.

42427268,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Arh,1484832821,Washington Lawmakers Are Trying to Keep Bitcoin Out of Pot Shops,"UPDATE (19th January 22:25 BST): This article has been updated with comment from Sen. Ann Rivers, the primary sponsor of the bill.      A new bill filed in the Washington State Senate is seeking to prohibit local marijuana businesses from using bitcoin.  Sponsored by Senators Steve Conway and Ann Rivers, SB 5264 seeks to amend some of the state’s rules governing the sale and distribution of marijuana products. The move comes more than four years after Washington voters passed a ballot measure legalizing marijuana in November 2012.  Under the proposed rule, businesses that work in the local marijuana industry would not be allowed to either pay for goods with digital currency or accept those kinds of payments from customers. The bill also includes a definition of ""virtual currency"" that explicitly targets ""digital representation[s] of value used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value"", but excludes the ""the software or protocols governing the transfer"".  Firms that grow marijuana or sell products that incorporate it would be covered under the proposed law's provisions.  The bill states:  ""A marijuana producer, marijuana processor, or retail outlet must not pay with or accept virtual currency for the purchase or sale of marijuana or any marijuana product.""  Washington was notably the site of an early adopter of bitcoin among marijuana dispensaries: Spokane-based Kouchlock Productions. The firm began accepting payments in the digital currency in 2014 and would be affected by the new bill (representatives of the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment).  In a statement, Sen. Ann Rivers said that the measure is aimed at boosting transparency in the state's marijuana industry, in a bid to ""help move it out of the shadows"".  Rivers told CoinDesk:  “One of the goals of my Cannabis Patient Protection Act, which became law in 2015, was to eliminate the black and gray markets for cannabis in our state. SB 5264 addresses another part of the regulatory challenge. After all the work we’ve done to get a handle on the cannabis industry and help move it out of the shadows, allowing the use of unregulated currency for cannabis purchases doesn’t promote the level of transparency we committed to develop.”  Business impact  The measure, if passed, would likely be seen as a blow by proponents of the marijuana industry's use of digital currency as a means to circumvent a key issue facing those businesses today: a lack of banking access.  Simply put, most US banks are loathe to allow marijuana-focused companies to open accounts due to the federal prohibitionhttps://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml of marijuana. While some US states have passed ballot initiatives in recent years that have either approved medical or recreational use of marijuana, the federal ban keeps most banks on the sidelines.  Some advocates have therefore argued that bitcoin and other digital currencies can help ease this pain point by giving those companies a functioning payment mechanism.  Rob Fess, director of marketing for wholesale marijuana sales platform Tradiv, told CoinDesk that the proposed law further highlights the impact of the effective bank blockade against businesses in the industry.  However, he suggested that some kind of legal backlash is likely in light of the proposal.  “It seems like quite a stretch to single out a specific industry to be excluded from using a particular type of payment – I imagine the lawyers will have a field day with that,” he told CoinDesk.

42427267,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Alh,1484828714,Questions Linger As China's Bitcoin Exchanges Halt Margin Trading,"Huobi and OKCoin, two of the world's largest bitcoin exchange businesses by volume, have formally announced they have halted margin trading services.  In statements issued today on the OKCoin's Chinese-language website and Huobi's Weibo account, the exchanges confirmed changes rolled out quietly roughly a week ago when customers reported restrictions on lending-based services.  Representatives from Huobi told CoinDesk that the exchange stopped its services two days ago, and that it will no longer offer margin trading on its China-facing website or its international alternative, BitYes. They also confirmed that Huobi was asked directly by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) to stop the services today, but that it had not previously heard from the central bank on the matter.  This coincided with what appears to be a formal acknowledgement of findings circulated in China-based news outlets yesterday.  According to The Wall Street Journal, the PBoC has issued a statement that reads:  ""These exchanges have been in violation by getting into the margin financing business, causing abnormal market volatility. The inspection also found these exchanges didn’t put in proper international anti-money-laundering controls.""  Yet, other exchange representatives sought to downplay the idea that the changes may be permanent.  An exchange representative, who declined to be identified, called yesterday's news stories ""sourceless reporting"". ""This is informal guidance that is being interpreted as formal guidance,"" he said.  Likewise, Huobi indicated it believes the guidance to be ""informal"", and that it may lack the weight of formal written guidance or a legally binding edict.  As with other China-based exchanges, Huobi said it would continue to cooperate with the central bank and its requests  Representatives from OKCoin could not be reached for official comment.  'Not illegal'  Despite the formal acknowledgement of changes, exchange representatives seemed to push back against the idea that there was full clarity on how China's regulatory climate would move forward.  In statements to Reuters, BTCC CEO Bobby Lee added that the PBoC's requests were ""not based on any official documentation"", and that the central bank has not issued an opinion that bitcoin margin trading is ""illegal"".  Lee could not be reached for additional comment at press time.  The representative from Huobi also suggested there remains a lack of clarity on how things will develop going forward.  When asked if this meant that margin trading would end in China, she noted only that smaller exchanges had not been asked to end the practice.  ""I just know regulators asked the three major exchanges to stop,"" she added.  A representative from OKCoin, speaking privately, said that he believes it may be possible for margin trading to continue for international customers. OKCoin operates both a China-facing bitcoin exchange (OKCoin.cn) and an international website (OKCoin.com) that operates out of Hong Kong.  ""You could have margin go away, or there might be a situation where Chinese people can't use it,"" he said.  Little impact  At press time, the price of bitcoin was up 0.5% on the day, suggesting the impending announcements were already priced in by market participants.  Yet, there was a sense among some traders that any prolonged end to margin trading could have an impact on the global bitcoin market.  Reports have suggested China accounts for as much as 95% of global trading, though other estimates peg this figure at the lower, but still dominant figure of 85%.  China-based over-the-counter trader Zhao Dong suggested that there is a fear that reduced margin trading could impact exchange liquidity.  Other traders expressed that they are still in ""wait and see"" mode, pending any formal statements from China's regulators.

CSDs from Canada, Luxembourg, Norway and South Africa – all members of the Liquidity Alliance – are working with the stock exchange firm to create what they have dubbed the “LA Ledger”. The initiative is currently in the prototyping phase, using the code underlying the Hyperledger project as its basis.

Glenn Goucher, president and chief clearing officer for the Canadian Depository for Securities Limited, said in a statement:  “With this initiative, we pursue an innovative partnership approach that will allow us to jointly embark on distributed ledger technology with a use-case that is highly relevant to the wider industry”  The initiative is the latest blockchain-related project for Deutsche Börse, which began testing the technology in early 2015. In late November of last year, the firm revealed that it was working with Germany’s central bank on a securities trade prototype.
