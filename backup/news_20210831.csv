42396943,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT8Bro,1630444027,Inside Arbitrum’s Staggered Mainnet Launch,"As gas costs soar on Ethereum and non-fungible token (NFT) drops routinely burn thousands of ETH, yield farmers and traders have been eagerly anticipating the arrival of Arbitrum’s rollup technology.  Despite the pent-up demand, however, signs are pointing to the layer 2 scaling solution’s launch being more of a process rather than an event.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Offchain Labs co-founder Steven Goldfeder emphasized that while the launch is a step in the right direction, there’s plenty more work to do before the network can handle a significant portion of Ethereum’s transaction load.  “We’re very excited, very humbled by the support we’ve gotten,” said Goldfeder. “Today’s the day we can finally provide scaling for the Ethereum user. But as exciting as that is, we’re rolling up our sleeves because there’s still work to be done. It’s still a mainnet beta, and there’s still steps to take to full decentralization.”  Early days  Arbitrum’s official Twitter account, usually quiet aside from the occasional technical update, has seen a flurry of activity today once the team announced a $120 million Series B raise at a $1.2 billion valuation, a $1 million bug bounty program with Immunefi and an announcement that Balancer will be live after the official launch tentatively scheduled for “late afternoon EST,” said Goldfeder.  However, the team is quick to note that not all of the reported 400 teams that are planning to launch on the network will be available on day 1.  “We’re still tied to developer timelines for each of those teams,” Offchain Labs Director of Partnerships A.J. Warner said in an interview with CoinDesk. “A number plan on going live or ASAP, and I don’t want to spoil the announcements from those teams, but there are a number of large, layer 1 projects everyone knows that should be going live today or tomorrow.”  The delay is caused in part due to the DeFi ecosystem’s network of interdependencies.  “In many ways it’s a game of Lego blocks,” said Warner. “When you speak to specific teams they have three or four dependencies they need before they can go live, so it’s about stacking.”  He pointed to Chainlink, an oracle service necessary for lending services like Aave, whose yields are, in turn, necessary for farming services like Yearn.Finance. Chainlink currently has “a number” of price feeds up and running on Arbitrum, with more planned to launch. Likewise, The Graph, another key tool for organizing blockchain data, is currently live as well.  Ultimately, all of the projects that have announced planned implementations on Arbitrum are eager to launch as soon as possible, but the permissionless, interconnected nature of decentralized finance (DeFi) is creating a temporary bottleneck.  “All of the teams listed on the portal have indicated they intend to go live in the near future, once all dependencies are live, tested and stable,” said Warner.  Gradual decentralization  In addition to the ecosystem migrating at a slower pace than some Ethereum users would like, Warner says that the network will be operating with some centralized permissions in the early days, as well as with some network throttling until a track record of stability has been established.  “We’ve talked about it in the past – it’s still mainnet beta. We’re going to be maintaining certain centralized controls for fast upgradeability and ensuring the stability of the protocol early on,” he told CoinDesk. “We don’t like to say this is the finish line, in many ways this is the start line. We’re going to be ramping up, but we’re gonna have some rate limiting early on.”  Goldfeder said Arbitrum will use gas limit throttling to start the network with roughly the same transactions per second (TPS) as Ethereum. The team will increase traffic throughput as demand ramps up.  “We’re going to ease into things. We’re going to start off today with roughly Ethereum’s capacity, and we’ll increase that limit over time as traffic increases,” he said.  Additionally, Goldfeder said that centralized controls will allow “fast upgrades in the coming weeks to months,” but after further “security diligence” and an established track record of stability, those controls will be phased out.  Token?  In addition to the launch, traders have been eager to hear more details about a possible Arbitrum token, especially as valuations for layer 2s like Polygon soar and multiple platforms launch incentive programs with eye-watering price tags.  Goldfeder told CoinDesk the team would be eschewing a token just for the sake of incentive programs. The team is confident they can compete without one.  “We’re excited about all of the organic excitement that we’ve seen, and we believe that’s an extension of Ethereum’s organic community. We also expect several projects to launch application-level incentives on Arbitrum,” he said.  Goldfeder specified that “there will be no token” in the immediate term, and noted that the $120 million raise was purely equity financing.  Currently, the team’s revenue model is a transaction fee routed to Arbitrum as part of the core fee structure, and Goldefeder told CoinDesk that the team is confident that the fee structure is “very viable.”  However, he did leave the door open to a token down the road, saying the end goal is a fully decentralized system in the hands of the community. While that vision “doesn’t include plans for a token” at the moment, a DAO may decide to tokenize at a future date.  Getting to the end goal of a fully decentralized system, however, means measured and at times cautious steps.  “My main focus is to get rid of those controls, but only in a responsible way. We’re calling this our ‘mainnet beta,’ and we believe it’s the most responsible way to launch.”  UPDATE (Sept. 1, 13:30 UTC): Corrects spelling of Steven Goldfeder’s name.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LINK | TRADING | ARB,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/31/inside-arbitrums-staggered-mainnet-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fbb4f2b0dcfaa3e9fdf105c50a9687e41705f254-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396950,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT8Byh,1630442431,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Slips Below $48K as Focus Shifts to Regulation,"Bitcoin slipped below $48,000 on Tuesday as traders monitor the latest batch of regulatory developments. The cryptocurrency was trading around $47,000 at press time, down about 2% over the past 24 hours.  China’s central bank reiterated its concerns about cryptocurrencies on Tuesday, weighing on investor sentiment. The central bank highlighted perceived risks involved in crypto trading, a major reason for the country’s crackdown this year on exchanges.  In the U.S., analysts are waiting for the Securities and Exchange Commission to decide when and whether to approve a bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF). “The fact that agency officials are sending signals about how they’re approaching these applications says something,” CoinDesk’s Nik De wrote in the State of Crypto newsletter published on Tuesday.  For decentralized finance (DeFi), however, “the SEC seems to be building precedents for more enforcement actions in this part of the crypto world,” De wrote.  Also on Tuesday, the parent company of stablecoin issuer Tether and crypto exchange Bitfinex, petitioned the New York Supreme Court to block the state’s attorney general from releasing documents to CoinDesk. The documents would detail the composition of Tether’s reserves over the past few years.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC) $47,262, -2.7%  Ether (ETH) $3,419, +2.2%  S&P 500: -0.1%  Gold: $1,817, +0.3%  10-year Treasury yield 1.305%, +0.025 percentage point  For now, some analysts see additional short-term consolidation in bitcoin, albeit above the 50-day moving average support level around $40,000.  “Once initial resistance is cleared, which we expect beyond the very near term, targeted resistance would become the all-time high near $69K-$70K,” wrote Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, in a Monday newsletter.  End of extreme leverage?  The winds are starting to shift in crypto markets from extreme leveraged trading to a more tame environment.  For example, crypto exchange FTX lowered its maximum leverage for these derivatives to 20 times, and Binance announced a similar move (which it said was implemented a week prior). BitMEX, whose former executives are facing trial in the U.S., still offers 100 times leverage, but its current CEO said in July that such aggressive borrowing is “very rare” on the platform.  While these actions seemed to signal the end of an exuberant era, they arguably capped off a trend that began months earlier, CoinDesk’s executive editor, Marc Hochstein, wrote in the Crypto Long & Short newsletter on Sunday.  The chart below shows the one-month bitcoin futures premium across exchanges has declined from 40% in mid-February to current lows around 8% – likely a sign of decreased leverage.  Ethereum fee spike  Transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain have spiked recently, partly due to the resurgence of non-fungible token (NFT) activities.  Total transaction fees currently sit around 10,000 ETH per day, a relatively high level compared with the “DeFi summer” witnessed in 2020, according to data from Glassnode.  “However, the heightened market attention for NFTs has come at a cost, with DeFi tokens appearing to be the losers in the equation,” Glassnode wrote in a blog post. For example, blockchain transactions involving a number of large DeFi tokens have reached new lows.  DeFi activity heats up  Despite some weak spots in transaction data, DeFi tokens have caught a strong bid this month. “This has especially been the case for Avalanche, where $180 million in liquidity mining incentives have triggered a parabolic move in the chain’s total value locked (TVL) and in the native token price,” Glassnode wrote in a blog post.  The chain’s TVL has increased from near zero to over $1.8 billion. Avalanche surged nearly 200% over the past month to an all-time high near $58, but has slipped just below $40 at press time.  August altcoin surge  Speaking of altcoins, August was a strong month for cryptocurrencies such as Cardano’s ADA token along with Polkadot’s DOT and XRP. High returns, especially relative to bitcoin, suggests altseason is heating up, as discussed in Monday’s market wrap.  From a technical perspective, ADA is starting to pull back after reaching extreme overbought levels last week. Lower support is seen around the $2.40 to $2.60 breakout range, which could stabilize the decline.  Altcoin roundup:  ETH looks to have become more scarce than BTC since the activation of EIP-1559. Data tweeted by Lucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, shows ether’s daily annualized net issuance fell to 1.11% earlier this week versus bitcoin’s 1.75%. If the trend continues, ether could attract store-of-value demand, which until now has been concentrated mainly toward bitcoin.  NFT marketplace wars: Topps is utilizing the Avalanche blockchain to mint its latest collection with Major League Baseball (MLB), the trading card company announced on Tuesday, CoinDesk’s Eli Tan reports. That’s a switch from an earlier deal, where the Wax blockchain hosted the release of Topps’ first MLB-licensed non-fungible token (NFT) collection in April. Topps said in its press release that it was using Avalanche because it is “fast, low cost and eco-friendly.” The company added that “the site removes the need for special wallets or token apps and provides a single location to buy, sell and explore officially licensed Topps NFT collections.”  Bored Apes, meet Modigliani: Sotheby’s is bringing Bored Apes to the world of fine art. The 277-year-old British auction house will be selling a collection of 101 Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs created by Yuga Labs in an auction running Sept. 2-9. It will also offer a collection of 101 Bored Ape Kennel Club NFTs. Sotheby’s estimates the BAYC sale will total $12 million to $18 million, while those for the Bored Ape Kennel Club will fetch $1.5 million to $2 million, according to a press release. Bored Apes is the second-most popular NFT collection by total trade volume behind CryptoPunks, according to rarity.tools. The floor price at the time of writing for the cheapest available Bored Ape on the open market is 48.8 ETH, or $165,578.

42424667,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVjth,1630438510,"Nigeria’s CBDC: The Good, Bad and Ugly","Central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are fast gaining popularity worldwide, including in Nigeria. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) recently outlined plans to launch an eNaira in October.  CBDCs operate just like the money you see when you check your bank accounts online, with the eNaira issued by CBN and held directly in citizens’ digital wallets.  While cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are decentralized, unregulated and unbacked, CBDCs are regulated, centralized and backed by a central bank (the regulator).  Olumide Adesina is a Nigeria-based certified investment trader with more than a decade experience.  CBDCs are typically pegged to the fiat currency in place at the central bank. Compared to the wild volatility of crypto assets, the value of a CDBC is backed by the country’s monetary reserves.  “The eNaira is the Central Bank of Nigeria’s attempt to stay in tandem with other global central banks as decentralized modes of storing value and payment become more mainstream,” said Samuel Sule, a director with the Renaissance Capital investment bank.  But he cautioned that Nigerians could see the project as rendering decentralized digital assets as obsolete.  “There are underlying philosophical questions around the centralization of digital currencies, which could make it unappealing to a large section of its users. That said, monetary policy legally remains the exclusive realm of central banks. Thus, all work done around new modes of value storage and transmission is justifiable.”  Good  The CBN aims for the CBDC to increase financial inclusion rapidly and easily. Creating and holding funds for citizens in a central bank account could offer better access to financial services for the unbanked or underbanked.  Ben Constanty, co-founder of Smartlink, which brings applications to the decentralized web, highlighted some of the unique opportunities the CBDC can provide citizens of Africa’s biggest economy in regards to mobile accessibility:  “As Nigeria is still considered one the most ‘unbanked’ countries in the world, decentralized identity systems and CBDCs will provide the population with a way to prove their identity and get access to banking services directly from their smartphone. It also means that every transaction will go through that system in order to buy and sell things.”  The CBDC will also make remittances easier. With restrictions on foreign exchange and the high transaction fees associated with transferring money in and out of the country, many Nigerians are already using bitcoin to make domestic and international transactions cheaper and faster.  In addition, the central bank will be able to achieve its objectives of safeguarding people’s money, ensuring a safe and resilient payment system, and strengthening public confidence in the naira. As it provides transparency and is difficult to counterfeit, it could be a good way to combat economic crime and fraud.  With the eNaira, consumers can access low-risk and reliable payment options. By eliminating the need for third parties, the CBDC could contribute to efficient and low-cost transactions.The CBN will also be able to implement the cashless policy and numerous jobs will be created for Nigeria’s booming youth population as a result.  Taxes and transaction costs will increase the government’s revenue. And it should help to combat terrorism financing, illicit fund flows and criminal activities, and enhance oversight of fund movements and payments.  Bad  But the eNaira could give the CBN greater control. A growing user base for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has already made Nigerian financial regulators worry about losing control over the money supply. The momentum is considered by them as a threat to economic stability and money in general.  Some economists also believe the CBN can spend in deficit and shift funds directly to citizens without worrying about the national debt in times of economic hardship. In other words, a CBDC could present an obvious inflation risk.  The eNaira might disintermediate the banking sector if it becomes mainstream. Nowadays, Nigerian commercial banks serve as intermediaries between depositors and intermediaries so funds can be secure and are available when needed; the intermediary gives interest as a means of attracting funds for a specified period of time.  Read More: Nigeria Is the Lion of Africa in Bitcoin P2P Trading| Olumide Adesina  Nigerian banks might face a challenge when dealing with such digital assets. In the case of the CBN, for instance, offering everyone a virtual wallet where they can store their money, there would be little need for banks today. Unless the CBN grants the banks new licenses to do this you do not need a bank to administrate your wallet, thereby increasing the redundancy of the Nigerian banking industry.  The eNaira also raises big concerns when it comes to privacy, especially with a government that violates human rights on a regular basis. The centralized digital asset could also eliminate the privacy that cash provides. This could serve as a tool for financial regulators monitoring human rights organizations and what they do with contributions they receive.  “As central banks globally jump on the digital currencies wagon, the space is likely to witness more regulations, limitations and even censorship, as these will be controlled networks,” says Constanty.  Ugly  The hideous thing about the Nigerian digital currency is that it centralizes money even more and preserves the oligopoly power of the CBN. Unlike crypto assets, such as bitcoin and ethereum that aim to democratize and decentralize finance, the Nigerian digital currency grants near-total control to the Nigerian apex bank.  The confidentiality and anonymity of transactions are reduced when central banks monitor and control transactions more closely. Each transaction can be monitored, recorded, analyzed and taxed using digital tools provided by the CBN.  This would also enhance control over the level of access a Nigerian citizen has to a financial system, particularly if the citizen attempts to engage in behavior considered threatening by the financial authority.  Inevitably, the Nigerian digital currency would cause centralization, a situation that would exacerbate already rife cyber vulnerabilities and increase attack surfaces and vectors, making the Nigerian central bank a target.

Not according to Jill Richmond, International Policy and Advisory Board member at the Global Digital Asset and Cryptocurrency Association. “Regardless of [a] CBN digital currency, we believe that cryptocurrencies will still have a place in Nigeria’s emerging digital economy due to their public and permissionless nature.”  So Nigeria’s digital currency could be a huge plus for crypto enthusiasts and demonstrates Nigeria’s interest in leveraging the benefits associated with adopting digital currencies “Early adopters will gain big advantages in the long run. Nigeria along with other “non-aligned movement” and “second world” countries have an opportunity to leapfrog into what is thought of as the first world economy, said Mayande Walker, chief executive officer at OpenCryptoTrust, a blockchain developer.  “Smart early adopters can begin offering financial services and applications that are in line with what is clearly the future of money. While bigger economies stumble past the complexity of adoption and change, Nigeria, Vietnam, Philippines, Turkey, Peru (along with Switzerland) can cut through to the future.

Some of the most recognizable faces of the non-fungible token (NFT) industry signed with United Talent Agency (UTA) for representation across film, TV, video games, publishing and licensing, the Hollywood Reporter reported today. The high-powered entertainment agency will also represent Meebits and Autoglyphs, two other NFT projects created by Larva Labs.  CryptoPunks could be the first NFT to break into more traditional forms of media, which Larva Labs co-founder Matt Hall told the Hollywood Reporter would be “for the benefit of the entire community connected to our projects.”  Licensing rights have been a controversial topic in the NFT sector because they are often seen as antithetical to its decentralized and permissionless nature. Larva Labs has been aggressive in enforcing its intellectual property rights as it has issued claims under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which bans copying and selling or freely distributing copyrighted digital content and works.  The news about CryptoPunks stirred a strong reaction among some observers of NFTs. “The punk community has told the story of punks, and that emergent, organic and AUTHENTIC story telling is the ONLY reason punks are what they are,” tweeted Scott Lewis, the co-founder of data company DeFi Pulse. “I’m skeptical Hollywood agents, however talented, can license the imagery authentically without deep engagement w the punk community.”  The move to sign CryptoPunks, Meebits and Autoglyphs comes just a week after UTA signed Rally, a fan engagement and monetization toolkit the agency believes will help connect crypto-related talent with fans.",POSITIVE,없음,TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/31/united-talent-agency-signs-cryptopunks-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/167657f7e95cedd206c038cb9ec5609458f5e5dc-1198x552.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ability to store official documents digitally on top of the Algorand blockchain will come before the end of this year, Koibanx CEO and co-founder Leo Elduayen told CoinDesk.  “We want to make business transactions and any other commercial act secure, transparent, agile and automatic,” Elduayen said.  Koibanx first approached El Salvador’s government after it passed a law in June that made bitcoin legal tender in the country, Elduayen said.  “We assumed that a government that is willing to take this type of measure might be also open to use or leverage blockchain technology for other aspects – not only for what the law defines itself, but for other government areas,” he noted.

In addition, all transactions between private companies or individuals with different government entities will be recorded in the Algorand protocol.  Elduayen clarified that money won’t be exchanged on the platform, but securities or rights, such as property titles or bank guarantees, will be.

The Bull Market Is Not Over, Phase 1 Has Just Begun According to a CryptoQuant analyst, past cycles show that the current Bitcoin bull market isn&apos;t over yet. The puell multiple seems to reveal where the price might head next. The puell multiple is a BTC indicator used to tell how healthy miners&apos; revenue is. It&apos;s calculated by dividing the mining revenue by the 365-day moving average (MA) of the same. Puell Multiple= Mining Revenue USD ÷ 365 MA​ (Mining Revenue USD​)​ With the help of the metric, it becomes possible to say how much selling pressure miners are facing. When the indicator has high values, miner revenue is relatively healthy, thus miners aren&apos;t compelled to sell. While low values could suggest they are facing considerable selling pressure. Since miners hold large amounts of Bitcoin, significant selling pressure among them could impact the price of the cryptocurrency on a visible scale. Now, here is how the puell multiple changed during the 2011 and 2013 bull cycles: The Puell Multiple vs the Bitcoin price during 2011 and 2013 The above graph numbers the different phases of these runs, and the colored zones help reveal the pattern of where the price heads next after touching each.

42394447,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdYpL,1630430758,Why Everyone in NFTs Is Suddenly Talking About Price ‘Floors’,"EtherRock Price is a Twitter bot account that tracks the price of EtherRock, a collection of 100 pet rock JPEGs that live on a blockchain. Spun up on Aug. 6, the automated Twitter account arguably has more utility than the project it serves. It’s a direct line into how people are valuing a series of worthless-on-the-surface non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Created in 2017, EtherRock is one of the oldest NFT projects, but it has only recently attracted buyers’ attention. Currently, the cheapest rock, Rock ID 96, is listed for 678.88 ETH, or about $2.2 million. The owner of Rock 0 is asking for 10,000 ETH.  By its founder’s own admission: “These virtual rocks serve NO PURPOSE beyond being able to be [bought] and sold, and giving you a strong sense of pride in being an owner of 1 of the only 100 rocks in the game :)” Indeed, apart from rank and small variations in color, all the rocks are identical reproductions of the same royalty-free, clip art image.  In a sense, EtherRock is the quintessential contemporary NFT project: The humor, the rabid fan base, the self-aware, total conflation of value and price. No one can say for sure why a rock that sold for $50,000 at the beginning of the month is now worth millions – other than there’s momentum behind these boulders.  Nowhere is that more evident than in the project’s closely watched “price floor.” A term borrowed and bastardized from commodities trading, a floor price is the lowest price at which an NFT can be bought for a particular project.  In commodities trading, the term refers to price controls imposed by governments or groups that set the minimum amount someone could charge for a good, commodity or service. It functions as a way to prevent a race to the bottom in pricing, often to buoy a particular industry.  In crypto, it’s often one of the few hard pieces of data that accompanies an NFT project, and is somewhat comparable with bids and asks in traditional order book markets. But it also may not say much about the viability of a project.  In semi-liquid NFT markets, a hot project will have a rising price floor. But given the limited number of buyers and sellers on both sides of a unique digital asset trade, there’s no guarantee the price can hold.  “A lot of this stuff just gets bid up very hard by speculators. But then there isn’t necessarily liquidity on both ends,” an NFT trader who goes by 0xSisyphus said in an interview.  Like with all else in crypto, there’s also a social meaning behind the numbers. A price floor also represents the weakest hands in a market – the lowest price at which a particular seller is willing to undercut other holders. In some communities, people are badgered into not selling at a given price.  Of course, price floors are not the only way to judge the value of an NFT. There are subjective readings of a project’s community, there’s an asset’s programmable rarity, there’s provenance and history. There’s also more technical metrics like determining what percentage of a project’s supply has been listed over time – a cue into how many motivated sellers there may be.  Crypto is not unfamiliar with industry-specific ways to measure novel digital assets, which often do more harm than good. Take market capitalization: Derived by multiplying the total amount of coins in circulation by a cryptocurrency’s price, the metric is essentially meaningless as a way to judge different assets with different circulating supplies. There’s also “total value locked,” or TVL. Specific to the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry, this is a metric former CoinDesk reporter Brady Dale called “so simple it’s confusing.”  Given the absurdity of the moment – when the ground floor for getting into digital rocks is an astronomical $2.2 million – it’s not surprising that people are latching onto any metric they can.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/08/31/why-everyone-in-nfts-is-suddenly-talking-about-price-floors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b6caf63b82336ad70d7100666efc49a0f24ce18-1137x803.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421768,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpO5F,1630427096,The CeFi-DeFi Battle Has Already Begun,"Right now, much of the attention in the world of financial services is focused on the explosive growth of the DeFi (decentralized finance) ecosystem on Ethereum. When I last checked DeFiPulse.com, I counted 30 lending services, 32 trading, 20 derivative tools, 22 wallets and another 22 asset management entities, not to mention more than 20 types of algorithmic and asset-backed stablecoins. That number has surely gone up between the editing and publishing cycle alone.  Paul Brody is EY’s global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  Collectively, these 200-plus services amount to a re-creation of major portions of the existing banking activities. Basic functions like collecting deposits and making loans are already represented as well as many major types of trading activity. Right now, this is a business for risk-tolerant early adopters, offering big returns and commensurate levels of risk. It won’t always be like that. Ambitious DeFi companies are targeting big chunks of the traditional centralized finance (CeFi) business and their more risk-averse clients.  DeFi companies and protocols have some big advantages, starting with ruthless efficiency. Startups like Uniswap, SushiSwap, Poly, Celsius and more are building high-volume operations with a fraction of the staffing levels and cost structures that are necessary in the existing banking industry. The permissionless, interoperable and open nature of the Ethereum ecosystem means that building a better lending algorithm doesn’t require that you build an entire banking infrastructure first. DeFi companies can also iterate their solutions much faster than API-based systems, which are typically permissioned and far less standardized than most ERC-20 and -721 tokens.  Despite these advantages, the existing financial services ecosystem is not going to give up their customer base without a fight and has some significant advantages of its own, starting with regulatory compliance skills. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made it clear that “decentralization theater” won’t protect investor-owned companies from scrutiny and that governance tokens, which are all too often marketed and sold as investible assets, do not pass any Howey Test exempting them from regulation. Traditional finance companies know this game well and have mature processes for everything from securities registration to Know-Your-Customer compliance.  Read more: Gary Gensler Isn’t Buying Your Decentralization Theater  Beyond regulatory compliance, the existing financial services industry has some big advantages it will need to deploy against blockchain-native upstarts. The first is the ability to act as a one-stop shop. Credit cards, mortgages, business loans and, yes, even checks are not going away anytime soon. The ability to seamlessly integrate multiple dimensions of the financial ecosystem will be a powerful advantage. Having one view of your financial assets – on-chain and off-chain – is powerful. Most consumers and business users won’t want to know or care on which back-end system the transaction is occurring.  Legacy players assume they have time when early market penetration is so low. They don’t.  Traditional financial services companies will also bring a much wider view of the customer to this fight. Most on-chain lending systems, for example, rely upon collateral to make loans, and today that collateral is entirely on-chain. Banks, with credit histories and mortgages, will have a much wider range of assets and data to consider and will be able to offer a great deal more credit at much lower rates.  As with all intense competitive battles, this one will result in both parties coming to look a lot like their competition. Blockchain startups are acquiring banking licenses as fast as they can and expect oracles to bring off-chain assets and credit ratings into the mix. They are also hiring regulatory compliance teams, bringing in auditors and security experts and starting to mature internal processes to manage risk.  For some, this will feel like the end of an era. And it is. The speed with which new products come to market will slow down, as they encounter layers of regulatory and security checks. But the size of the prize is going up. Blockchains and crypto assets are currently a $2 trillion market. Global stock markets alone contain more than $71 trillion in assets. It’s not unreasonable to imagine a future in which much of those assets migrate on-chain and get put to work in DeFi ecosystems.  Read more: Money Reimagined: Can DeFi Stay Decentralized?  Right now it’s too early to forecast the winners, but the last two decades of technology-driven transformation should stand as a warning to the legacy financial institutions. In my personal experience working with some companies that are struggling to change, I think there are two important mistakes that some legacy players have made as the internet transformed their markets. The first was the assumption that, in taking on the regulatory and operational complexities of the real world, new players will find themselves equally burdened. I believe they won’t. Legacy players, whether they are banks or retailers, usually have decades of process complexity layered together. Adding new technology is much easier than stripping away layers of complexity.

42396964,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT8FNF,1630424445,Tether Asks Court to Block NYAG From Releasing Documents to CoinDesk,"The parent company of stablecoin issuer Tether and crypto exchange Bitfinex has petitioned the New York Supreme Court to block CoinDesk and other organizations from receiving documents detailing the composition of Tether’s reserves over the past few years.  The petition was filed on Tuesday by Tether and Bitfinex’s attorney, Charles Michael of Steptoe & Johnson, against the State of New York, Attorney General Letitia James and Freedom of Information Law Appeals Officer Kathryn Sheingold, in response to a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request filed by CoinDesk.  To help bolster its claim that releasing such information would hurt its business, attached to the petition were several dozen articles as exhibits, including a few from CoinDesk itself.  “Competition is fierce, with upstart exchanges constantly entering the market and challenging the incumbent,” the petition said. “Bitfinex and Tether differentiate themselves from their competitors using at least three secret and competitively sensitive types of data that are at issue in this proceeding: (1) financial strategies, (2) compliance measures and documentation and (3) customer data.”  Thus, letting the New York Attorney General release such information “would tilt the competing playing field against Tether. CoinDesk, the online publication seeking the records in this case, has itself summarized what competing stablecoins have disclosed, and none are at the level of detail in the requested documents.”  Also noted in the petition is the difficulty cryptocurrency businesses such as Tether and Bitfinex have had in finding banks that would work with them, and the ways Tether and Bitfinex have tried to overcome such roadblocks. “Bitfinex and Tether have spent years cultivating non-public relationships with financial institutions around the globe that are capable of processing a high volume of high value transactions efficiently,” according to the filing.  Tether settled an investigation by the NYAG into its finances for an $18.5 million fine earlier this year.  The full FOIL request by CoinDesk asked for the release of any documents attesting to Tether’s reserve composition, similar to what the company published earlier this year.  It said, in part, that CoinDesk was:  Filing a FOIL request for a copy of the asset reserve composition details backing the stablecoin tether ($USDT) for Tether Operations Limited. These details should have been provided to the OAG as part of the investigation into iFinex which was settled earlier this year. I’m specifically only looking for information about what is backing Tether’s reserves, including the document Tether claims to have sent OAG in May 2021. I do not currently need any other documents about the investigation or about the OAG’s ongoing monitoring of Tether’s reserves over the next two years.  Attorneys for Tether asked the NYAG’s FOIL officer not to release these documents, and the FOIL officer initially agreed to this request, denying the application. CoinDesk appealed the decision, and Sheingold, the appeals officer, reversed the FOIL officer’s decision. Tether had until Wednesday, Sept. 1, to petition the court to stop the release of the documents.  Tether General Counsel Stuart Hoegner has said in the past that the company would publish its reserves as well as submit documentation about the reserves to the NYAG’s office.  “Tether proposed ongoing publication of the reserve breakdown as part of our settlement agreement with the New York Attorney General’s Office, and we committed to make that information available to both the Attorney General’s office and the public,” Hoegner said in May.  Lance Koonce of Klaris Law, who represents CoinDesk in this matter, said of Tuesday’s filing, “We were disappointed, but not surprised, to see that Tether has filed a proceeding to block the release of documents sought pursuant to CoinDesk’s Freedom of Information Law request, after the Office of the Attorney General agreed with CoinDesk on release of those documents. We look forward to seeing the OAG’s decision vindicated in court.”  A Tether spokesperson said:  Today, we have filed an Article 78 proceeding to prevent the release of certain materials we provided to the New York Attorney General’s Office as part of our reporting commitments under the settlement agreement signed earlier this year. This information was provided at our suggestion and in good faith to demonstrate to the Attorney General’s Office that the information they relied on to agree to the resolution remains consistent.  As of Tuesday, Tether’s market capitalization based on the total amount of USDT in circulation amounted to $65.5 billion.

Community input  That community is now UniWhales’ biggest asset as it looks to expand its services.  “A lot of our DAO members are well-connected, high-net-worth individuals,” said Aaron, noting that upwards 35% of DAO members have given feedback on how the product should operate.  The dynamic leads to a much more efficient iteration system than a company having to “bribe users with Starbucks gift cards,” he joked, adding:  “Web 2 is where you have the team, product and customers, and in Web 3 you have the team and DAO members collaborating on products together.”  One product the team will develop is Drip, an on-chain affiliate marketing product built on Polygon, which first emerged from a ETHGlobal non-fungible token (NFT) hackathon.

You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  What a year this month has been  The narrative  What dog days? August has been a pretty crazy month. While the Senate’s infrastructure bill has sucked up a large amount of the oxygen, there’s been quite a lot of other news. Maybe the most important items in the U.S. came from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which seems to be gearing up for a busy autumn.  Why it matters  The SEC is one of the most important federal regulators to the crypto industry in the U.S., and in recent months it’s been signaling a more aggressive approach to the crypto industry.  Breaking it down  There are three key things I’m watching for with the SEC this fall. The first is the possible approval of a bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). We’ve talked about bitcoin ETFs before, and judging from comments from SEC Chair Gary Gensler, it sure seems like a futures-based ETF is more likely than a spot-based ETF. An approval wouldn’t be the same as if the SEC approved a full bitcoin ETF, but it’d still be a regulated investment product that people curious about crypto, yet hesitant about directly investing in bitcoin, could look to as an alternative.  There are two interesting signals on the ETF front that seem to support the idea that one (or more) futures-based products might be approved this year.  The first signal came when Gensler told the Aspen Security Forum that he looks forward to SEC “staff’s review of such filings, particularly if those are limited to these CME-traded bitcoin futures.”  A handful of companies immediately filed bitcoin futures ETF applications in the wake of his remarks.  More recently, VanEck and ProShares applied for ethereum futures ETF products, but simultaneously withdrew them on Aug. 20. This suggests that the SEC spoke to these companies privately. The SEC has asked companies to withdraw their ETF applications in the past (particularly 40 Act funds, so named because they operate under a 1940 law).  There’s still no guarantee that a bitcoin ETF – or even a bitcoin futures ETF – will receive the SEC’s green light this year, but the fact that agency officials are sending signals about how they’re approaching these applications says something.  The second big thing on my radar is what kind of, sort of, maybe looks like a brewing turf war between the SEC and its sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), over jurisdiction within the crypto market. It’s too early to say this is happening for sure, and it’s obviously way too early to predict how it’ll play out, but it’s worth keeping an eye on what agency officials say about what falls under their purview.  However, we’ve seen comments from current and former CFTC officials about the agency’s role in regulating the crypto markets, including Commissioner Brian Quintenz, Commissioner Dawn Stump and former Chair Chris Giancarlo.  These comments seem to be a response to Gensler asking for greater authority over the crypto markets.  I think the discussion is going to become:  Who has oversight of specific spot markets?  Is an exchange subject to SEC jurisdiction just because some of its listed assets might be securities while others (like bitcoin) aren’t?  Does the CFTC have oversight of exchanges that list spot markets for cryptocurrencies that aren’t securities?  Stump said the CFTC doesn’t oversee these spot markets, but it’s unclear to me the SEC necessarily has a clear case in favor of this supervision either.  This goes back to the ETF question as well. The SEC has said in the past that it’s uncomfortable approving ETF applications unless it can closely track the market for potential fraud or manipulation.  A futures market operated by CME is far more likely to meet this standard because CME and the futures product it lists are regulated by the CFTC. The bitcoin spot market, spread across scores of exchanges around the world, is somewhat more unwieldy.  Finally, I’m keeping tabs on regulatory issues faced by decentralized finance (DeFi). I wrote about this earlier this month, but the SEC seems to be building precedent for more enforcement actions in this part of the crypto world.  Last week, AnChain.AI, an analytics firm, told Forbes it had signed a deal with the SEC to monitor DeFi transactions.  This comes on top of enforcement actions against DeFi trading platforms.  And, just to tie this back to the infrastructure bill we’ve all been looking at for the past four weeks, I understand that the Treasury Department does want to capture data from so-called decentralized exchanges with intermediaries, so I imagine there may well be some crossover there as well.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Today will be CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz’s last day at the agency. Biden has yet to formally nominate a chairperson to a full term at the agency (though rumors are he’ll tap Acting Chair Rostin Behnam), and it’s unclear how long it may take to fill Quintenz’s seat.  Elsewhere:  Cuba Regulates the Use of Virtual Assets for Commercial Transactions: The island’s central bank has published a resolution that defines how it will regulate virtual assets and virtual asset transactions. It also may create a license for virtual asset service providers, Andrés Engler reports.  Bitcoin Miners Hold Onto Rigs, Betting the Bull Run Will Continue: Crypto miners are holding onto their mining rigs in anticipation of their prices soaring as the bitcoin bull market continues, reports David Pan. There’s also (apparently) a roaring bitcoin miner futures market, where buyers can bet on the prices of these specialized machines at a future date. Note: These are different from hashrate futures.  Money Trail From Liquid Exchange Hack Points to Wasabi Privacy Wallets: The hackers allegedly responsible for stealing just under $100 million from Liquid Exchange may be using the Wasabi privacy wallet to launder their funds, Anna Baydakova reports. At least $20 million of BTC has been sent through Wasabi’s CoinJoin feature.  Beyond CoinDesk:  (Wall Street Journal) Avanti Bank, the Wyoming outfit spearheaded by Caitlin Long, has applied to be a full member at the Federal Reserve.  (CNBC) CNBC’s Lauren Feiner provides a nice rundown of the infrastructure bill fight, what it means and what may happen next.

Syndicate has already gathered a long list of backers via a seed round earlier this year, which was followed by a popular community raise. The Series A round brings the total participation to 150 venture capital firms (VCs), angel investors and founders, including actor Ashton Kutcher, entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian and rapper Snoop Dogg.  DAOs are a way of locking up funds on a public blockchain and allowing a group of participants to transparently share governance decisions, often done by voting, as to how funds should be invested or used. The funding round is perhaps the largest stamp of approval on DAO creation from mainstream investors.

The focus on ethical deployment of capital or underrepresented communities is where Syndicate co-founders Will Papper and Ian Lee see DAOs going next, but it’s just the beginning of the road.  “We hope that in the future, Syndicate is going to redefine what investing is and what it means,” said Lee in an interview with CoinDesk, adding:  “So, not only a protocol for investing in venture capital, or other forms of private equity. But to also serve as a general purpose protocol for things like grant-making, nonprofits or donations.”  DAOmentum  The Series A funding will go towards building out the extensive tooling, plus various types of formal and legal structuring that Syndicate needs to take DAOs to the next level, including adding a team of securities lawyers.  It’s a grand vision. Papper sees in crypto infrastructure an analogy of what the internet has done for content creators; what the DAO space is doing to corporations is similar to what YouTube did for filmmaking, he said.  “When you reduce the cost of setting up an investment fund by 1,000x, what happens?” said Papper. “The answer is that setting up an investment fund becomes as easy as sending a tweet – not that we recommend setting up investment funds via tweets.

42396951,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT8FDP,1630411208,FTX.US to Buy LedgerX in Bid for US Crypto Derivatives,"FTX.US is acquiring crypto derivatives firm LedgerX, a move that could pave the way for FTX to offer crypto futures, swaps, puts and calls to U.S. retail traders.  The acquisition, expected to close in October, will see LedgerX become a wholly owned subsidiary of FTX.US, said exchange President Brett Harrison. Once it does, FTX.US will wield a trove of futures market licenses crucial for derivatives trading in the restrictive U.S.  That the U.S. arm of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading empire would effectively buy its way into the American derivatives scene is hardly a surprise. FTX has amassed a seemingly bottomless war chest – for ad campaigns, stadium rebrandings and even umpire patches – through its highly lucrative global crypto derivatives business.  “There’s a huge amount of interest both in the institutional and the retail side in trading crypto derivatives, and given FTX international’s success in the crypto derivatives market it’s only natural that we would eventually want to enter that market here in the U.S. as well,” Harrison said.  Read more: FTX Renames Blockfolio Trading App to ... FTX  Entering that market is easier said than done, however. FTX.US sidestepped what would have likely been a years-long regulatory slog by snapping up a company that already made it through.  Buying LedgerX “just makes it that much faster for us to enter the market than if we were to go about this completely alone,” Harrison said.  Harrison declined to say how much FTX.US paid in the deal.  LedgerX license lineup  LedgerX has three key licenses allowing it to offer crypto derivatives products: a designated contract market (DCM) license, a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license and a swap execution facility (SEF) license. The SEF regulates LedgerX’s exchange platform and the DCO authorizes the company’s clearinghouse.  The DCM, which was granted by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2019, allows for the company to offer and settle futures.  Still, any FTX.US crypto derivatives offering will pale in comparison to the parent company’s scope because the CFTC only allows bitcoin and ether contracts.  LedgerX’s leadership, staff and board structure will remain the same post-acquisition, but the name will eventually change as the services become intertwined, Harrison said. He compared it to crypto spot market Blockfolio’s rebranding to FTX.  “The goal would be eventually from your FTX app, in addition to being able to buy spot ETH, to be able to offer ETH futures, or ETH call or put options.”  Read more: LedgerX Board Member Says Company in Disarray After Founders’ Ouster  LedgerX launched in 2013, offering a variety of derivatives around bitcoin.

If keeping your coins on an exchange, you are not allowed to spend them freely. You have to ask the exchange for permission to use them. Upon withdrawing the funds, you can pay for whatever you want, whenever you want, and at a suitable fee. Depending on the exchange terms, they may ask you to prove the source of income and send some identification documents or just block you because of going beyond the withdrawal limit. By keeping the coins in your possession, you can move any amount at any time and wherever you want. For example, there are no restrictions on playing in Bitcoin casinos or shopping online. 2. You may be misled that your coins are always available. The exchange promises to give them the moment you ask, but it may not be so. There are lots of unpredictable cases like the exchange hacked or the government interference when your coins can just disappear. It is crucial to understand that the bitcoins you can see in your account are just a number on the screen. As long as the exchange has a private key, you don&apos;t have any assets. You have only a password and a login. 3. When left on the exchange, the coins can be used in fractional reserve lending. It is profitable for the exchange, as it inflates the supply of Bitcoin.

42411921,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh5Qm,1630408584,Ether Poised for Biggest Monthly Price Gain Since April; Analysts Remain Bullish,"As ether heads for a monthly rise of more than 10%, analysts are maintaining a positive bias, citing $3,400 as key resistance to beat for the bulls.  The native token of Ethereum’s blockchain was trading near $3,340 at press time, representing a 31% gain for August. That’s the second straight monthly rally and the largest since April, when prices rose by nearly 45%, according to CoinDesk 20 data.  Data tracked by Skew show ether is the top-performing major asset for this month, with bitcoin languishing in second place on a gain of almost 15%.  Demand for ether spiked earlier in the month in hopes that the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 implemented on Aug. 5 would remove a notable chunk of coins from circulation.  The amount of ether burned is now directly linked to network usage because the EIP burns a portion of fees paid to miners.  The upgrade has burned a total of 146626.2 ETH since activation, taking out 40% of the new coins issued, according to data source Etherchain. Recently, ether’s daily issuance, or the number of coins mined, fell below bitcoin’s, indicating that the path of least resistance for ether is to the higher side.  Still, ether’s ascent has stalled since mid-August, with prices stuck in the $3,000-$3,400 range. According to Stack Funds co-founder and COO Matthew Dibb, traders have been occupied with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Furthermore, money has been flowing into the so-called Ethereum alternatives like Solana, Cardano, Cosmos and Avalanche.  Ether’s Bollinger bands, or volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving average (MA) of price, are narrowing due to the ongoing price squeeze.  The Bollinger bandwidth calculated by dividing the spread between the volatility bands by the 20-day MA has declined to 0.12, the lowest since October 2020. A prolonged period of low volatility consolidation often ends with a big move.  A bullish breakout looks likely as blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock foresees a supply crisis in ether. “Just in the month of August, more than 781,000 ETH have been withdrawn from exchanges. This, combined with the amount of ETH deposited in the 2.0 contract + the amount locked in DeFi (~ 9.7m) + the increasing burn rate driven by non-fungible tokens, may push a liquidity crisis in ETH,” IntoTheBlock said in the Telegram-based market insights group.  According to Stack’s Dibb, “A confirmed close [UTC] above the $3,400 range may pave the way to significant gains for ETH, despite the network’s gas being historically high.” Gas refers to the fee paid to execute a transaction or a contract on Ethereum successfully.  Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, also mentioned that price as the level to beat for the bulls. “We need to pay attention to $3,400 and see if we can get a daily close above. Otherwise, no confirmation and could just roll over,” Kruger told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Katie Stockton, the founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, expects a breakout as intermediate and long-term trends are positive. “The rising 50-day (~10-week) MA, near $2,707 currently, has now become initial support for ether, but we think short-term overbought conditions may be absorbed without a pullback of that magnitude,” Stockton mentioned in the weekly research note published on Monday, referring to the moving average.  Recent options market flows also suggest investors are positioning for a range breakout. “Options implied volatility has dropped off substantially from previous highs; however, we have seen renewed interest in ether call options for September and December expiry,” Stack Funds’ Dibb told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.

Before the pandemic, the traditional lottery industry operated based on physical sales points, but this is now changing as stakeholders move to adopt digital ecosystems. Even better, the advent of crypto assets is revolutionizing the industry, making it globally accessible. This article will review Crypto Millions Lotto, owned by the U.K. registered Wilmington Holdings PLC, one of the players that have integrated Bitcoin within its operations to enable more participation in some of the largest lotteries in the world. At the helm of Crypto Millions Lotto is financial markets veteran Sulim Malook; his experience dates back to the 1990s when he was an options trader focusing on Government Bonds Futures at the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE). This foundation led Sulim to develop a BlackBerry stock market application that was later converted into a lotto-style game based on share prices. Eventually, Malook sold the stock market application to a South American company whose niche is online lotteries. As fate would have it, the business demands in the growing lottery industry motivated Malook to develop solutions that could facilitate global participation.

The Beijing-based company wants to provide a platform for “young users around the world,” Raymond Chan, CEO of 9F’s Hong Kong subsidiary Ether Securities, said in the statement.  9F also said it will set up a research and development team in Singapore to look into non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) and the immersive gaming/internet experience frequently referred to as the Metaverse.  The company has been undergoing a leadership reshuffle in the last couple of months. Among other changes, on May 31, Director of Internal Audit and Internal Control Li Zhang replaced Lin Yanjun as CFO.  Last year, the overwhelming majority of 9F’s revenue came from peer-to-peer lending. In December it exited the industry, which China’s central government had condemned to eradication.  At the time, 9F had to pay back 340,000 lenders, Chinese media reported. 9F assigned the debt collection to a third party, AMC Entertainment Holdings, which reportedly quit the partnership just two months later. Local media reported that borrowers had set up “anti-collection” groups and were trying to get out of paying their debts.  The People’s Bank of China has vowed to maintain high regulatory pressure on crypto trading for the rest of the year.  In Hong Kong, 9F is licensed to deal and advise in securities, provide asset-management services and advise on futures contracts, it said in the press release.

New Zealand users can now hold an account on the Swyftx exchange with New Zealand dollars and may utilize deposits via local bank transfers, according to a blog post on Monday.  The exchange has also set up a network of local New Zealand support staff to field customer queries.  New Zealand has been on Swyftx’s radar for “some time,” the exchange said in a separate blog post. Recent partnerships and regulations have paved the way for Swyftx to support NZD on the platform, it said.  Many existing exchanges in New Zealand are limited and act as a “pass-through” for user’s funds, Swyftx said in its post. Like most exchanges, Swyftx passes on a fee for withdrawals imposed by its banking partners while local deposits take one to three business days.  Swyftx is the country’s second-largest exchange, with over 350,000 customers. The move marks the exchange’s first attempt at an expansion outside Australia.

Ethereum is the most popular second-generation cryptocurrency on the market, and the experts at learncrypto.com suggest that, for some traders, it poses a smarter and easier to use alternative. Here we will assess the advantages of choosing Ethereum, and look at its benefits in comparison to other types of cryptocurrencies: The Size of Ethereum&apos;s Market Share As mentioned above, Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency available and it is the largest and best known of the open-ended decentralized software platforms that provide cryptocurrency.

The market cap of Bitcoin stands at $700 billion, whilst the market cap of Ethereum is around $287 billion: there can be no doubt that these are both significant sums, but it means that Ethereum&apos;s business is around a third of the size of Bitcoins.

Krungsri Finnovate, the corporate venture capital arm of Thailand’s fifth-largest bank by assets, Bank of Ayudhya, joins Thailand’s major multimedia companies Plan B Media and Master Ad (MACO), both of which recently invested $9.2 million as part of the raise earlier this month. Other investors in the round have not yet been made public.  The Bank of Ayudhya, which is part of Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), is one of the first banks globally, and the first in Southeast Asia, to invest in a digital asset platform, Zipmex said in a press release on Tuesday.  With the fresh injection of capital, Zipmex plans to further develop its technological infrastructure, engage in new business partnerships, attract new talent and diversify its offerings.  Marcus Lim, founder and CEO, told CoinDesk via phone interview the funding will also be used to further expand into its key markets in Indonesia and Thailand while the exchange awaits its licensing from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the country’s top financial watchdog. The exchange currently has an exemption under the Payment Services Act, Singapore’s framework for the regulation of digital payment systems and payment service providers.  Zipmex is primarily focused on the fiat to crypto spot market and recently expanded its vision from being “just an exchange” to a “digital asset bank,” according to its founder.  “The first step toward that vision has been to offer an interest-bearing account,” said Lim, who points toward Zimex’s “earn” product. “The other two services we are looking to launch, which are the pillars of banking, are lending and also payments.”  Zipmex began its journey in January 2019 in Thailand just as the regulatory landscape was beginning to take form as the country began introducing mandatory licensing for crypto exchanges. While Zipmex awaited its licensing from Thai regulators, the exchange expanded into other regions across Southeast Asia including Indonesia and Australia.

Known as “Rare Pepes,” the tokens were minted as digital collectible cards back in the mid-2010s by blockchain pioneers focused primarily on Bitcoin, and traded using a niche platform known as Counterparty.  Encouraged by the increasingly eye-popping price tags for NFTs, some Rare Pepe collectors have begun using a years-old software protocol known as Emblem Vault to reconfigure the digital cards to run on the Ethereum blockchain. Then, they’re listing these “wrapped” Rare Pepes for sale on the dominant NFT marketplace OpenSea and turning smart profits.  Over the past few days, at least one Rare Pepe has changed hands for 149.99 ether (ETH), worth about $500,000 at current prices. Another copy sold for 111.1 ETH early Monday. Such price tags fall short of the million-dollar sales netted for some CryptoPunk and Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, but industry executives speculate the Rare Pepes could eventually reap even richer proceeds due to their historical significance.  “One of the things we have been witnessing is that the all-time highs for these Rare Pepes are doubling or tripling over the past couple weeks, specifically due to them having access to the capital on OpenSea and more broadly on the Ethereum blockchain,” Emblem Vault co-founder Shannon Code told CoinDesk in an interview.  The digital collectible card that sold for $500,000 was minted as one of 300 in September 2016, according to OpenSea.
