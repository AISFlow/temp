42429892,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22nh,1541017845,"Tether's Price Has Stabilized, But the Stablecoin's Supply Is Still Shrinking","In what's become a rarity over the past month, the price of the tether (USDT) stablecoin temporarily regained parity with the U.S. dollar Wednesday.  The token traded in the $1.00-$1.01 range for the better part of an hour, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of writing, it is trading around $0.987.  The exchange rate has been steadily climbing towards its $1.00 target since the stablecoin – by far the most popular among a slew of rivals – dramatically lost parity with the dollar in mid-October, falling as low as $0.85 on the Kraken exchange, one of relatively few where traders can sell USDT directly for dollars.  The exact reasons for the recovery are not clear, but the total supply of tethers in circulation has fallen rapidly in recent weeks. (Tether also briefly hit $1.01 on Monday.)  Since Oct. 14 Bitfinex – an exchange that shares common ownership and management with Tether Ltd., the company behind USDT – has sent 930 million USDT to a wallet controlled by Tether Ltd. known as the ""treasury."" These tokens are considered to have been removed from circulation, and though many of them still exist, Tether destroyed 500 million USDT last week.  As a result, the market capitalization of tether has fallen to under $1.8 billion, from its peak last month of $2.8 billion.  Writing to CoinDesk last week, Bitfinex's director of communications, Kasper Rasmussen, said that Tether is not scaling back its supply intentionally, adding that the destruction of tether tokens ""does not have anything to do with defending dollar parity.""  In an email to CoinDesk Wednesday, he declined to comment on ""secondary market price fluctuations of Tether."" He added, ""Bitfinex and Tether issue and redeem at 1 USD and that's all I can say.""  As the second-most traded cryptocurrency by volume, according to CoinMarketCap, tether holds a key place in the crypto ecosystem. Traders have used it as a way to speed up withdrawals and deposits to exchanges, which are often slow when using fiat currency, as well as a way to insulate themselves from price volatility.  Following the money  Notably, USDT tokens have been flowing consistently into a wallet controlled by Bitfinex, suggesting that the exchange is doing a lot of ""redemption."" The term, as used in the Tether white paper, refers to holders' ability to exchange USDT directly for U.S. dollars through Tether Ltd., a service many people say is not in practice available.  As the chart below shows, Bitfinex's USDT balance rose from close to zero to slightly more than 100 million from Oct. 25 to Oct. 30, the day the exchange sent almost its entire wallet balance to the Tether treasury in a single transaction. Since then, the balance has begun to climb again, hitting 39 million in just over 24 hours.  Following another 50 million transfer out of the wallet after this chart was prepared, the balance has fallen to 155,000 USDT.  Source: Next Wave Strat; yellow lines denote USDT wallet balances (left vertical axis), purple denote bitcoin price (right)  The USDT balances of other exchanges, meanwhile, have been declining.  Binance, currently the largest holder of USDT tokens after the Tether treasury, has seen its ""hot wallet"" balance fall from above 100 million on Oct. 23 to 38 million at the time of writing:  The large jump in the Binance hot wallet's balance on Oct. 23 represents a transfer from the exchange's ""cold wallet,"" which currently holds around 594 million USDT:  Bittrex, which offers a USDT-USD trading pair that allows tether holders to trade directly for dollars, has seen a steady decline in its USDT balance over the past 10 days, from 134 million USDT on Oct. 19 to 115 million at the time of writing:  Finally, Kraken, which also offers a USDT-USD trading pair and saw a notable inflow of tethers during the period when the stablecoin diverged from the dollar most drastically, has seen its USDT balance fall from nearly 55 million just three days ago, on Oct. 28, to just over 27 million.  While the exact trajectory of USDT tokens is not always obvious, it is clear that large numbers of tethers are flowing out of several exchanges, that large numbers are flowing into Bitfinex, and that Bitfinex is then sending them on to the Tether treasury.  In some cases, however, it appears that exchanges are sending USDT directly to Bitfinex. For example, a wallet believed to belong to Kraken sent 8 million USDT to Bitfinex on Tuesday.  The wallet address is not identified on Tether's Rich List, but it did recently receive a 2 million USDT transaction from a known Kraken address. Kraken did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Regarding the charts cited above, Bitfinex's Rasmussen said that they ""display data from the previous 10 days only. I'm not sure anything can be extrapolated from that.""

42429890,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22fh,1541016013,Vitalik Ends Devcon Talk With Sing-Along About Failed Ethereum Ideas,"""Consensus by bet – that didn't work. Hub and spoke chains – that didn't work. Proof-of-proof-of-work – that didn't work. Hyper cube chains – that also didn't work!""  Singing on stage alongside songwriter Jonathan Mann, ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin ended his keynote at Devcon4 in Prague on Wednesday, with a song that listed ""the graveyard of ideas"" from the past five years of ethereum research.  An annual ethereum developer conference, Devcon4 is all about ethereum – past, present and future – and Buterin took his time on stage to touch on all those time periods as it relates to the platform's long awaited switch to a more scalable and ecological paradigm.  Buterin placed a specific emphasis on the development history of this switch, its various learning curves and ""aborted attempts at solving Casper.""  Casper, a much-anticipated move from a mining-based proof-of-work consensus algorithm to a more delegating consensus algorithm dubbed proof-of-stake, has been in the works for ethereum since 2015.  Since then, the project has been nicknamed ""Shasper"" due to the fusion of Casper with upcoming scaling method, sharding. Sometimes also referred to more generally as ""ethereum 2.0,"" Buterin told the crowd that he was reviving an older name for the proof-of-stake switch, ""Serenity.""  ""I refuse to call it Shasper because I find it lame,"" Buterin said.  Name-calling aside, Buterin continued by saying that the switch is very near fruition.  Introducing ""100 percent genuine pure organic Casper"" alongside scalability improvements, Buterin expressed excitement about what the switch will mean for the ethereum platform.  He said:  ""Serenity is 'the world computer' as its really meant to be, not a smartphone from 1999 that can play snake.""  According to Buterin, while the switch has taken several years to emerge in any technical detail, improvements that have concentrated over the last two years means it is now closer than ever.  A history of hiccups  Listing through the history of Casper and sharding development, Buterin detailed several errors and deviations on the roadmap. For example, an early idea, named consensus-by-bet, was eventually scrapped due to its incompatibility with later research.  ""We created an entire proof-of-concept, it burnt months of our time,"" Buterin said.  The DAO hack of 2016  and the subsequent Shanghai attacks led to a six-month delay in research, but still, Buterin said, ""People were continuing to get a better and better idea of what a more optimal algorithm would look like.""  In 2017, he continued, ethereum research entered ""the industrious age,"" in which developers ""came up with the minimal slashing conditions.""  He told the audience:  ""We managed to nail down what a specification of hybrid [proof-of-stake] would look like.""  In March, an earlier form of the proof-of-stake switch – a form of Casper that was designed as a smart contract – was swapped out for a more efficient alternative, which was later dubbed Shasper.  Buterin said that while this ""did end up nullifying work that was done before,"" it improved the overall development by fusing the Casper and sharding workflows that had previously been working separately.  ""If we worked on one spec, one protocol that would get us the benefit of proof-of-stake and sharding at the same time,"" Buterin said.  Four step Serenity  According to Buterin, Serenity will be introduced in four phases.  The first phase, dubbed phase zero, will introduce the ""beacon chain,"" the new proof-of-stake based blockchain that will co-exist alongside ethereum itself and will allow Casper validators to participate.  ""This is halfway between testnet and mainnet,"" Buterin said.  Following phase one is a heavily ""simplified version"" of Serenity itself, featuring ""shards as data chains"" that will be able to cope for data storage but won't be able to transfer smart contracts or money from one shard to another. Following that, phase three will enable cross-shard communication – meaning users send messages and funds to each other across different shards.  The fourth and final phase, Buterin said, will simply feature some tweaks and optimizations.  Buterin also spoke about the future more generally. For example, he suggested ""improvements in privacy"" may be possible through anonymized ethereum shards that only share encrypted information on the ethereum blockchain itself.  Additionally, he expressed interest in updating the blockchain to starks, a cryptographic mechanism that allows for the trustless aggregation of transactions into verifiable batches, while also offering a privacy-enforcing component. The method is being pioneered by a for-profit company named Starkware that recently received a $4 million grant from the Ethereum Foundation.  Buterin also reflected on what needs to happen before the Serenity launch can occur. First, the specification – or technical manual that will guide development work going forward – needs to be stabilized.  ""The spec has been moving fairly quickly but will stabilize fairly soon,"" Buterin said.  This specification will then be implemented into different programming languages. There are currently around eight different teams working on implementations, Buterin said.  ""I think we're not that far from having a release candidate for the spec,"" Buterin continued, adding:  ""Launch – that's the milestone we're been waiting for, that the milestone working toward for the past four or five years, and that's actually not that far away.""

Merghart made the decision to leave the company last week and is now exploring other opportunities, according to people familiar with the situation. Coinbase declined to comment on the move when reached.  His departure follows that of the executive who hired him, Adam White, who left Coinbase earlier this month to become the chief operating officer of Bakkt, the new institutional crypto trading platform being launched by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent of the New York Stock Exchange.  White, who was Coinbase's fifth employee and most recently a vice president and general manager there, hired Merghart to join Coinbase Institutional at the start of May 2018. He joined from the U.K.-based megabank Barclays, where he'd worked as a director of U.S. equity trading since 2015.  Merghart is leaving out of frustration that he wasn't getting enough resources or clarity on the roadmap to building an institutional business, according to two people familiar with his reasons.  Earlier this month, Coinbase confirmed it had shut down an index fund geared toward institutional investors, just four months after it went live.  Going institutional  Still, the departure comes as Coinbase secures another $300 million of funding in a Series E round announced Tuesday, part of which the company said would go toward building the institutional side of the business.  In a recent Bloomberg interview, Coinbase president and chief operating officer Asiff Hirji said the growing custody and institutional businesses will account in the future for a large share of revenues, which are currently ""100% transactional.""  To be sure, Coinbase has no shortage of institutional bench strength.  It recently hired former Instinet CEO Jonathan Kellner as its new managing director of the Institutional Coverage Group and also added former Charles Schwab advisor Chris Dodds to its board of directors and former JPMorgan executive director Oputa Ezediaro to the Institutional Coverage Group.  Despite a sustained slump in cryptocurrency prices, a febrile atmosphere surrounds the expected advancement of Wall Street into the digital asset trading space.  Among the notable players, ICE is poised to launch bitcoin futures on Bakkt in early December, and Fidelity Investments is building a crypto trading platform.

42429894,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22lh,1541005056,Planting Bitcoin Part Four: Gardening,"Dan Held is the founder of crypto portfolio service Picks & Shovels. He previously founded data service ZeroBlock, which sold to Blockchain, and served as VP of product at ChangeTip.  This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" series.      Introduction  In my last article, ""Soil,"" I covered the Cypherpunks or the ""Soil"" in which he planted the Bitcoin seed giving it the best chance for survival.  Satoshi's design of Bitcoin's genetic code made it the best species of money ever created, he waited for exactly the right moment to plant the seed, and had planted it in the most fertile soil. Now it was time to nurture Bitcoin's development.    I've paired this song to ""Gardening"" because I think it fits the feel of the piece and adds additional depth. If you enjoy listening to this, please follow my playlist on Spotify.            Early Development    ""The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way."" — Satoshi Nakamoto            Satoshi chose to be anonymous, which fit the ethos of the Cypherpunks. People can project hopes and dreams on an anonymous individual, ensuring maximal narrative fit. That's why a book is often better than the movie. His anonymity was a critical component of the founder story — dev worship is dangerous things for an open source project aiming for decentralization. Volunteers need to rely on trusting the objective reality of the code, rather than focusing on the merits of the project leader.  ""It is high time for everyone involved in BTC to stop concerning themselves with the question of the identity of Nakamoto, and accept that it does not matter to the operation of the technology, in the same way that the identity of the inventor of the wheel no longer matters""- Saifedean Ammous  As a subtle jab to central banks, and as a nod to his admiration of the gold standard, he chose his birthday (on his p2p foundation website profile) as the date the US made gold ownership illegal through Executive Order 6102, April 5th. And he chose 1975 as his year of birth which is the year when the US citizens were allowed to own gold again.  ""[with Bitcoin] we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years."" — Satoshi Nakamoto  In his public statements, he usually focused on ordinary, mainstream, users, with his tone sometimes even excited in suggesting many ways bitcoin could be made more convenient or useful for commerce or other things. Satoshi was practical, which made interactions very easy and comfortable. He tended to avoid philosophical discussions and political arguments.  Additionally, Satoshi took steps to signal to the Cypherpunks, and future members, that Bitcoin wasn't a scam. The conservative deescalation of his mining contributions, never spending any of his coins, nor using his influence for any purpose, shows that he wanted the world to make up their own mind about his project and judge it on its own terms. And unlike every other founder in history, Satoshi never cashed out.  ""Bitcoin benefited from an extremely rare set of circumstances. Because it launched in a world where digital cash had no established value, they circulated freely. That can't be recaptured today since everyone expects coins to have value. Not only was it fair, but it was historically unique in its fairness. The immaculate conception."" Nic Carter  Many of the early Cypherpunks became core developers in the Bitcoin protocol like Hal Finney and Adam Bach. The caliber of the early development team attracted talented (soon to be ""core"") developers.  ""Gifted people tend to want to work with other top people and work on something that matters, that they believe in. Motivation matters. Protocol design and coding is partly an artistic, aesthetic endeavor; people do their best work on a mission: uncensorable global internet money"" — Adam Back  The Gardener Leaves  Satoshi showed a great level of restraint and took a long-term perspective on issues, as when Satoshi resisted the calls for bitcoin to market itself as a funding mechanism for Wikileaks after PayPal famously froze its account. This, Satoshi argued, would only bring down legal and regulatory hammers that much faster. Satoshi recognized the need to carefully cultivate Bitcoin.  ""I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage."" — Satoshi Nakamoto  The connection to Wikileaks at such an early stage, at the height of what could be called public resistance against the Iraq war, probably gave Bitcoin a very different dimension. So he did not mince his words nor hide his intention for leaving in what can be called the last public statement where he says the US government was headed towards Bitcoin.  ""It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us."" — Satoshi Nakamoto  In April 2011, Gavin Andressen notified Satoshi that he was meeting with the CIA. Any further involvement might give away his identity which would endanger the long-term success of the project. Bitcoin now had enough support that he could walk away, and so he did.  ""Satoshi left because he didn't want its influence to affect the protocol development creating a single point of failure. The very idea of ""Satoshi Vision"" itself is against Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin"" — Frederico Tenga  Social Scalability  Satoshi was able to walk away because Bitcoin had trust minimization baked into the protocol. This is what made it socially scalable.  ""Power and scale breed conflict and corruption, that the purest part of any revolution is the beginning."" — Dhruv Bansal  It is easy to start with good intentions, however as things scale that becomes harder and hard to maintain. Bitcoin was specially architected to be trust minimized. Satoshi set it up so that there is no one person or group whose power can be coveted, usurped, or broken.  ""Bitcoin is a social breakthrough, not a technological one"" — Alex Hardy  Bitcoin needed to be the universal language for money. You are communicating with strangers worldwide, which you neither know nor trust that agree you own an abstraction of value.  ""Bitcoin is a distributed incentive structure we collectively engineer and freely opt-into. It's political technology, the first of its kind. This leaderless-ness is one part of what gives Bitcoin — in particular, beyond other cryptocurrencies today — such robustness."" — Dhruv Bansal  HODLing, the Hero's Journey  ""In the beginning of a change the patriot is a scarce man, and brave, and hated and scorned. When his cause succeeds, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a patriot."" — Mark Twain  Satoshi built Bitcoin for the believers in a new financial system, the HODLers, the revolutionaries. The ones who were disenfranchised with the existing financial system. The ones who would be attracted by the prospect of sudden and spectacular change in their life.  We must heed the call for a Hero's Journey (the HODLer) that is rooted in HODL. It's not just a meme, it is representative of foundational values upon which stronger cultural memes are eventually developed. This supports Bitcoin's cultural foundation.  The Hero at the beginning of their Journey has values that do not agree with the values that the Hero ends up with at Journey's end. That is the entire point of undertaking the Journey, but is also what makes it so frightening. The Hero must let go of his/her former self in the pursuit of this transformed version of themselves. The Journey's end is unknown, but what is known is that the Journey inspires the acquisition of new knowledge, the relinquishing of outdated paradigms and the abandoning of the familiar. The HODL Journey in Bitcoin sketches a map that becomes clearer with the acquisition of knowledge.  ""Over and over again, the financial system was, in some narrow way, discredited….The rebellion by American youth against the money culture never happened."" — Big Short  Satoshi needed to bootstrap the network with an incentive mechanism — the block reward which (a) controlled currency supply of Bitcoin and (b) created an incentive for people to participate in the network. Each cycle brings aboard a new set of true believers; a new set of HODLers. They, in their turn, become strong advocates for the adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value. Contagious Freedom. Vijay Boyapati  ""Hodling bootstrapped Bitcoin into existence. Hodling increases value, which increases demand, hash rate, and network security, which, in turn, attracts new hodlers and devs. This self-reinforcing feedback loop drives Bitcoin's network effects, security, and value."" — @TobiasAHuber  Satoshi had encoded in Bitcoin DNA a mechanism to incentivize the participants, through the shared belief in Bitcoin manifested via HODLing.  ""In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value."" — Satoshi Nakamoto  Early HODLers believed in Bitcoin despite overwhelming negativity and false information (ex: labeled as a currency for money launderers and drug dealers, price fluctuations). HODLers had stronger risk appetite to weather the volatility of being a first mover. They're practitioners of skin in the game.  In terms of the Hero's Journey, ""HODL!"" is the mentor's advice to the Hero in his Journey. Its roots are firmly based on the futility of trying to beat the market (Efficient Market Hypothesis and Hayekian Distributed information both dictate that the market can't be systematically outperformed).  The increase in Bitcoin's price has corresponding virality. And as it expands, HODLing becomes popular with people with a lower risk appetite, pulling in more and more network effect into the Bitcoin black hole — Dan McArdle  Via the Lindy Effect, the longer Bitcoin remains in existence the greater society's confidence that it will continue to exist long into the future. It slowly seeps further into the psyche of those in charge.  ""Protocols die when they run out of believers."" — Naval  The faith in a new financial system is what binds everything together. Bitcoin is not just a software project. It's a method of coordination for a large group of people who face powerful adversaries. Bitcoin isn't just a technological breakthrough, it's also a social one.  ""When people are ripe for a mass movement, they are usually ripe for any effective movement, and not solely with a particular doctrine or program. All mass movements are competitive, and the gain of one in adherents is the loss of all the others….A stable and sustainable ideology must be the foundation of all cryptocurrencies. No amount of cryptography, or consensus protocol development will help a cryptocurrency with an unstable and bankrupt ideology. Stable ideologies allow communities to thrive"". Kay Kurokawa  A simple example in religion is the Christian tenet that ""there is one true god"". This belief strengthens the religion because it weakens membership in competing religions. Communities with unstable ideologies will eventually collapse.  ""Unlike Bitcoin, nobody needs to explain why gold is valuable. Gold is simple. Bitcoin is complicated. So in the long run, the argument goes, Bitcoin can never replace gold… It's true that the stories we tell matter, but those stories can change. Stories don't win over everything. Eventually, raw utility supplants tradition. Bitcoin is a serious improvement over gold and starts to displace its role, the market will respond and re-price accordingly… To the digital native of the future, Bitcoin wallets will probably seem more natural than vaults full of useless metals painstakingly drilled out of the earth."" — Haseeb Qureshi  Money is a winner-take-all technology, driven by network effects. The crypto with the most HODLers, therefore, is the most demanded by consumers and will be the ultimate winner.  ""Bitcoin is digital gold in the eyes of [HODLers]. To some extent this group already operates on a Bitcoin Standard: investments are evaluated on their ability to yield a return in Bitcoin."" Tuur Demeester  HODL forces us to extend our gaze beyond the present. It forces our present selves to content with an alternate reality. HODL asks us to reconfigure our present set of preferences to permit the consideration of a future Bitcoin-based digital economy.  HODL is a noble basis for a Journey. Through the sacrifice of current consumption, HODLing is a net benefit for everyone as it increases every coin's purchasing power.  ""No Hero fights alone; All for one, one for all. Your call to HODL need not be the same as mine; indeed, they can be very different. Yet, in the end, they all redound to the benefit of each other."" — Prateek Goorha  Bitcoin promises an alternative for citizens across the world to keep their savings in a form of money that can neither be confiscated nor diluted. If Bitcoin grows much larger, it may force governments to become a voluntary organization. Through HODLing, we may finally be free.  'The secret to happiness is freedom; the secret to freedom is courage' — Thucydides  Those who opt-in to Bitcoin, are trading something abundant for something scarce, trading the past for the future, trading financial dependence for financial sovereignty.  Conclusion  Satoshi architected the perfect genetic code necessary to a new species of money, Bitcoin. He then waited for the precise moment to plant the new species, the 2008 Financial Crisis. At that moment, he distributed the whitepaper to the only group that cared — the Cypherpunks. And finally, he nurtured Bitcoin to a stage where it no longer needed him.  Many digital cash systems came and went over the years before Bitcoin and after Bitcoin. Most were just whitepapers, some wrote and developed code, some even built a community, but it will be extremely difficult to repeat the success of Bitcoin's planting.  ""Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I have really worked, is mine."" — Nikola Tesla  If you enjoyed reading this, please:  1/ Follow me on Twitter.  2/ Sign up for my weekly newsletter which contains my distilled thoughts of the week  3/ Check out my other articles.

42429871,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22Fh,1540999209,Indian Officials Met to Discuss Possible Ban on 'Private Cryptocurrencies',"The Indian government is considering imposing a ban on what it calls ""private cryptocurrencies"" in the country.  At the 19th meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) on Tuesday, the country's finance minister Arun Jaitley discussed ""the issues and challenges"" of crypto assets and cryptocurrency, among other things, according to a press release issued by the government's Press Information Bureau.  In the discussion, the council was briefed on the ""deliberations"" by a high-level committee chaired by the secretary of economic affairs to come up with an ""appropriate legal framework to ban use of private crypto currencies in India.""  While the status of any framework for the ban is currently unclear, if it comes into effect it would likely rule out the general use of cryptocurrencies by the country's citizens for exchange and trading. However, the wording would seem to leave the country clear to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC), as has previously been proposed.  In August, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country's central banking authority, indicated it was researching a possible introduction of a rupee-backed CBDC to cut its annual bill of nearly $90 million for minting physical cash.  Despite the negative slant on private cryptocurrencies at the committee meeting, it also saw discussion of a plan to ""encourage"" the use of distributed ledger technology.  Already this year, the National Institution for Transforming India, widely known as NITI Aayog, has said it was looking to develop a proof-of-concept to explore blockchain in key sectors including education, health and agriculture.  The meeting comes as the cryptocurrency industry in India is already in crisis following an April order by the RBI that prevented domestic banks from providing services crypto firms such as exchanges.  Since then exchanges have been seeking ways to keep their businesses from failing, including launching crypto-to-crypto trading. However, Zebpay, once the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume in the country, shuttered its trading services last month. Furthermore, last week, a crypto ATM run by the Unocoin exchange was seized by police and its co-founder arrested.  Legal petitions from a number of exchanges to overturn the RBI ban are currently being heard at the country's supreme court, which on Oct. 26 asked the government to provide its opinion on cryptocurrencies within two weeks.

42429879,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22Rh,1540995316,Promise: A Startup Based on an Anonymous Paper Plans to Replace ACH,"""It appears to be a replacement for the entire ACH system of banking.""  Taariq Lewis, the founder of multiple blockchain startups and the SF Cryptocurrency Devs engineers meetup, sent that note with an attached white paper to CoinDesk in early August.  ""It's really strange,"" he said. ""We received a copy of the white paper attached, anonymously. We're not sure who wrote it, but it looks interesting.""  The U.S.'s Automated Clearing House (ACH) network has been in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry's sights for years. The system handles large batches of credit and debit payments for consumers, governments and businesses – around $47 trillion worth in 2017 – so replacing it would be no small feat.  But according to Lewis, this white paper – titled ""Promise: A Decentralized, Peer-to-Peer, Proxy Repayment Protocol,"" dated August 7 and written by a so-called Yoshiro Shinji – appears to have figured it out.  That Yoshiro's proposed protocol is called Promise seems like an incredible coincidence, since Lewis had told CoinDesk on August 6 – the day before the paper's listed publication date – that a startup he'd been building in stealth mode for months, Lyra Protocols, was now called Promise.  Perhaps even more of a coincidence, Lewis was routinely aware of the details of CoinDesk's conversations with this Yoshiro Shinji, referencing answers Yoshiro had given to CoinDesk's questions.  Still, Lewis, founder and CEO of Promise, contends he and his colleagues – Alan Szepieniec, a researcher at the Catholic University of Leuven and Promise's chief scientist and cryptographer, and Giuseppe Ateniese, a professor of cryptography at the Stevens Institute of Technology and an adviser to Promise – were not the ones that wrote the white paper.  Yoshiro Shinji, he said, is a pseudonym for a group of people who are ""really are passionate about cryptography.""  If something about this storyline seems familiar, consider that Szepieniec, Lewis and Ateniese have decided to reveal Promise's master plan to supplant ACH on October 31, the 10th anniversary of the bitcoin white paper's release.  In a follow-up paper published today, titled ""Stronger Promises,"" the three authors (whom this paper lists by name) expand on Yoshiro's proposal for a blockchain employing ""proxy re-signing."" This cryptographic technique, first developed in the 1990s at AT&T Labs, is what the Promise team argues will bring the payment capabilities offered by ACH to the blockchain.  But the new paper also adds features intended to make the chain appealing to businesses in the long term: privacy and quantum resistance.  And with that, according to Lewis:  ""This is a business chain that's going to last another 100 years.""  Once it launches, that is, which the team tentatively expects to happen in late 2019 or early 2020.  Beyond Alice and Bob  A great deal of ink has been spilled regarding blockchains' ability to replace traditional financial infrastructure.  But according to Yoshiro's white paper, ""cryptographic peer-to-peer digital payment systems cannot yet fully emulate the automated payment ﬂows common to the third-party payment processor systems used in current electronic banking transactions.""  Take bitcoin, for example. By design, all payments using the original blockchain are ""push"" payments authorized by the payer. To use cryptography's stock characters – Alice signs a transaction, sending some bitcoin to Bob.  And that is fine for some use cases, but it makes automated payments of any kind a pain.  To pay suppliers or employees in bitcoin, businesses would have to initiate all of those transactions manually, even if they are predictable and recurring. Using bitcoin's rudimentary scripting language, they could schedule a payment for later, but only by locking coins up in advance.  According to Lewis, Promise's proxy re-signing technique will allow businesses to outsource such payments to third parties, as they often do in the fiat world using third-party payment processors.  So Alice gives Dan permission to make a payment to Bob every other week on Alice's behalf, using a signature that appears to come from Alice. ""We are aiming to enable payment 'pull,'"" Yoshiro told CoinDesk, ""without payment channel commitments, via cryptographic primitives.""  As a result, Alice saves time and money, and Bob doesn't have to frequently remind Alice to pay him.  While smart contract platforms such as ethereum have moved past the basic functionality of bitcoin, Lewis said that making proxy payments using these systems presents an obviously unacceptable security issue.  ""I would literally need to write that private key into the smart contract and then the smart contract would run that transaction with my private key into the payment that you had directed,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""So yes, you can do this with smart contracts, but then you have to expose the private key in the software for that to run.""  Meanwhile, the other option current blockchain systems provide – locking tokens up for future payments – appears to ignore the realities of financing a business. Firms rarely sit on hoards of cash sufficient to meet their accounts payable months or years in advance. Instead, many firms fund obligations such as payroll using short-term commercial paper and depend on cash flows to keep up with these payments.  In contrast, with Promise, ""we can really have authorized, unsecured lending on-chain, something that was previously impossible,"" Lewis said.  Proxy re-signing, he added, might be a ""small piece of innovation,"" but it's ""mind-blowing"" because of the capabilities it brings to the world of public blockchains.  The pledges  The Promise data structure that allows Alice to outsource her payment authorization to Dan is called a ""pledge"" – a sort of smart contract proposed by Yoshiro that governs the way Alice, Bob and Dan's public and private keys interact.  But according to Lewis, the original design was ""unnecessarily complex,"" not to mention a bit clunky.  For one, Yoshiro's design used a privacy-enhancing technology called ring signatures. Lewis likened that technology to a Trabant, an East German car model that's mentioned, if ever, as one of the worst cars ever built.  The Promise startup's white paper, on the other hand, uses techniques Lewis likens to a McLaren, a British luxury sports car. These are mainly inspired by Mimblewimble, a project developed with the aim of improving bitcoin's privacy protections.  Privacy was one of the main improvements the ""Stronger Promises"" authors aimed to make to the Promise protocol, said Lewis, who pointed out that none of the current privacy-oriented coins focus on ""legitimate business,"" instead focusing on ""high-risk behaviors.""  The other major improvement that the startup aimed for was quantum resistance.  While many think the introduction of powerful quantum computers is still far in the future, they certainly pose a serious threat to the signature schemes that underpin most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum. For instance, some think that these computers will be able to derive cryptocurrency private keys from their corresponding public keys fairly easily, allowing someone with access to such a computer to spend anyone else's coins.  ""If you're building a chain or if you're innovating on a chain state, in 10, 20 years you will be innovating on a post-quantum chain,"" Lewis told CoinDesk. ""It's not even a question of if, it's simply a question of how many years.""  But to accomplish quantum-resistant privacy, the Promise team needed to create massive signatures. According to Lewis, that means the Promise block size will be perhaps 50 megabytes (bitcoin maintained a controversial 1 megabyte block size limit for a long time) – and that's ""just to get started on testnet.""  Referencing the fiery debate that eventually led to the bitcoin cash split, Lewis, who's an active member of the bitcoin cash community, said:  ""We've been arguing about blockchain sizes since 2014. In a post-quantum world, this is not even a debate.""  Sticking with openness  These aren't the only ways that Promise stands out, though.  The startup has also made a commitment to building an open, public blockchain network secured by proof-of-work – in other words, miners – a decision that deviates from most blockchain projects focused on enterprise adoption.  Among those designing blockchains primarily for commercial use, there is a broad distrust of open, public networks, which can – and do – attract participants that reputable firms don't want to do business with.  Proof-of-work blockchains, in particular, tend to receive a frosty reception from businesses, due to their openness – anyone with the capital and know-how can validate the chain, not just permissioned nodes – as well as their questionable environmental credentials.  The rationale for Promise creating a public blockchain, Lewis said, is to allow users to build an online credit reputation and control access to their payment history (the Equifax data breach has focused attention on the ills of centralized credit scoring).  ""Public blockchain also means more competition for financial services,"" he added, saying that technology leads to lower prices (though bitcoin transaction fees have occasionally spiked).  As for mining, Lewis acknowledged the environmental effects and said Promise would encourage ""green mining."" But he called proof of work ""a critical and important aspect to blockchain technology,"" since it provides ""economic incentives to those with electricity to secure the network.""  Case in point, prior to emerging from stealth as Promise, the startup – then called Lyra Protocols – partnered with Obelisk, a manufacturer of specialized mining hardware, to develop mining equipment specifically for its blockchain. That equipment was meant to be released to community members at the same time as the protocol's (secret) hash algorithm became public.  The intention was to prevent a large mining hardware manufacturer like Bitmain from dominating the network early on, instead giving a head start to members of the community. Obelisk, though, has since failed to deliver other batches of miners on time.  Still, Lewis said Promise continues to work with Obelisk. But he added, ""we're really impressed that other people and other teams are coming to offer us their services as well.""  He declined to name other providers that Promise is working with but emphasized that specialized miners would ship before the launch of the protocol itself.  And, in a final contrast to other recent blockchain projects, the Promise blockchain will launch with zero promise tokens in existence. The first 840 tokens will come into being when the genesis block is mined.  In one of the few comments Yoshiro gave directly to CoinDesk, they said:  ""No premine. We are going back to mining and proof of work.""

42429867,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22Bh,1540990842,Hong Kong Stock Exchange Taps Digital Asset for Post-Trade Blockchain Trial,"The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) has teamed up with distributed ledger startup Digital Asset to develop a blockchain platform for post-trade processing.  The two firms are exploring the development of a blockchain-powered platform for HKEX's Northbound Stock Connect program, a spokesperson for HKEX told CoinDesk.  The news comes after HKEX revealed in March that it was looking to follow the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in putting settlement transactions on a blockchain-based platform. Notably, Digital Asset is also developing that platform as part of a plan to replace the ASX's ageing CHESS clearing house system by 2021.  Launched in 2014, Northbound Stock Connect allows international and mainland Chinese investors to trade securities in each other's markets through the trading and clearing facilities of their home exchanges.  Currently, investors that trade via the system are constrained by the tight settlement cycle of mainland China trades, with just a four-hour window to complete trade and settlement. Time zone differences across regions further complicate the post-trade processing.  HKEX said it has already completed a functional prototype along with Digital Asset aimed to resolve these issues. The prototype allows a group of market participants to specify settlement workflows in advance and thus helps bridge time zone differences.  Additionally, the trial system enables the real-time synchronization of post-trade status between asset managers, brokers, custodians and the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited – HKEX's securities clearing house.  HKEX said it is now planning to engage with a wider base of market participants for the next phase of the proposed platform development.  Elsewhere, a number of stock exchanges are eyeing blockchain as a means to improve clearing and settlement, and other processes, including in Singapore and India.  Just last week, Germany's central bank, and Deutsche Börse, owner of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, completed a blockchain trial investigating the technology's potential in securities settlement.

42429875,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22Lh,1540987243,The Pen Is Mightier Than the Sword? Bitcoin's White Paper Proves It,"Erik Voorhees is the CEO of ShapeShift.  This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" series.      There's an old adage that ""the pen is mightier than the sword.""  Growing up, it always bothered me. I knew it to be wrong… obviously a sword is mightier, and even on the metaphorical level, the world seemed changed more often through violence than literature.  My thinking is different now, for with every day that passes, Satoshi's original writing handily demonstrates the validity of the adage. Within only several pages, Satoshi conveyed a design for what would become the foundation of the world's future monetary and economic systems. It hasn't fully happened yet, but we're seeing it unfold in front of us. And I think we may take this 10-year anniversary to remember why it matters…  Humans have a depressing tendency to suffer under self-imposed delusion, and perhaps history can be viewed as the process of mankind sporadically discovering and casting off the self-deception under which it toils. Plato's Allegory of the Cave conveyed it eloquently.  We live under many delusions, and for the last 100 years, at least, one such delusion has been that of fiat currency. Fiat currency is, without exaggeration, the most odious fraud ever perpetrated upon mankind.  Let's consider it for a moment…  Fiat operates as follows: a group of certain people (called ""central bankers"") acquire the right (and indeed the mandate) to declare what shall be valued most in society; that most liquid and tradeable good: ""money."" They acquire this right through a combination of opportunism and ignorance — opportunism on the part of political and financial interests to place themselves at the helm of monetary creation, and ignorance on the part of the public, which has very little understanding of finance altogether. And tragically, in the fraud of fiat, the victim subjects ask — indeed they plead — for the machination to be placed down upon them. They do it out of fear of financial calamity.  They do it because their leaders tell them it's good for them. They do it to feel secure, as a child wrapped in a blanket. Franklin is often cited as condemning ""those who would sacrifice liberty for security,"" yet having lost its revolutionary spirit, today this group seems to include nearly the entire population.  And indeed, once a large enough portion of people begin asking for the wise others to control and declare for them their system of value, it becomes institutionalized, and subsequent coercion is easily injected to enforce and maintain the system. Those who disobey the proclamation are punished — their property is stolen, their time is stolen, or in severe cases, their lives are stolen. The sword is employed, seeming in these cases so much more powerful than the pen. It is welcomed by the public, born down to implement and enforce the apparatus of fiat.  And with this combination of public support at the fore, and the coercive sword behind, all of mankind has knelt down into the stockade.  Under the fiat system, a portion of the wealth of every man, woman, and child, is taken — stolen — each year. The portion is only a few percent, not so bad as to feel imprisoning, especially as the dirty trick of inflation is to induce price levels to rise, rather than bank account balances to fall, and while the two are mathematically similar, those aware will recognize the latter, yet not one in a hundred really sense the former.  Why does the bread increase in price each year? It is not due to 3 percent annual growth in the greed of the baker. Through the syphoning of this wealth, anointed ""public servants"" make decisions and allocate resources that do not belong to them, and in the best case, this leads to recklessness (perpetually-increasing government spending) and in the worst case, enables the wanton destruction and darkness of war, paid for — in part — by the trick of fiat inflation.  As Ron Paul commented on the 20th century, ""It is no coincidence that the century of total war coincided with the century of central banking."" When accurately interpreted, fiat is a barbed-wire around the neck of civilization, piercing only enough for non-lethal blood letting, and constraining only enough to remind the victim not to run too fast in any other direction. That period in which the wire is severed, in which such delusion abstains — not just for one or several people, but for all of them — will be one of mankind's brightest historical moments.  The promise of Bitcoin is but for a chance at that moment.  It is toward this end that Satoshi's humble paper compelled so many of us. The goal, if I may presume the core of Bitcoin's purpose, is to end the global system of fiat money within which we have trapped ourselves, to end the delusion, and it will do so by simply providing an open and unstoppable alternative to it; by illuminating a path out of the cave.  Bitcoin exists to separate the essence of value from any particular person or group of people. By so doing, the ability to control and manipulate money — that is to say, to control and manipulate the vast sum of people which endlessly chase after it — is substantially reduced. It reduces the power of any such ambitious group, inevitably reducing the  corruption therein.  This was begun by several pages of text a decade ago, and now unfolds with no person leading the charge, yet millions inspired toward its execution. It now happens inevitably, uncontrollably, spontaneously upon the winds of markets, growing in momentum and effect with each passing year. Despite its decentralization, Bitcoin exudes an irresistible financial gravity, pulling into it people, resources, technology and energy itself. As it grows, those at the margins fall into it — first a layer of cryptographers grappling for decades with the struggle for privacy in finance and communication, then engineers, then financiers and marketers and lawyers and writers and entrepreneurs and artists. And yes, as with all booms, it has pulled in its share of scammers and frauds and superficial preachers.  Its reach now extends even beyond humanity, for politicians themselves are increasingly pulled within its grasp… most finding a comfortable home at Ripple.  Regardless of the froth and the noise, the fundamentals of crypto are sound. The technology works: for years now Bitcoin has operated correctly, growing swiftly in the hostile wilds, spawning countless other species, both competitive and collaborative. How does one defeat a Hydra in which there are not only so many heads, but so many independent bodies?  For those of us out here in the frontier with it, I think even we do not comprehend the power and inertia that is unfolding before us. The ability to move value effortlessly across the Earth was overdue. It is a power which should've arrived at the dawn of telecommunication, yet was censored while mankind stumbled through its fiat feverdream.  This power of universal transaction is arguably the inevitable extension of the pen that conceived it. All that has unfolded came through the consequential physics of the publication of several pages of text. And how far has it come?  Ten years in and Bitcoin could hardly be more successful — indeed since its genesis it has clearly been the most successful form of money ever invented. It has thrown entire bodies of economic theory out of the window, the old practitioners gripping tenuously from the balcony. Bitcoin grew 10,000-fold without the anointment of any king, nor the blessing of any banker. The Nobel Prize-winning Paul Krugman still so vehemently condemns it. Perhaps that is really the source of its unending power?  Despite every professional condemnation, Bitcoin stands as proof that money can emerge through decentralized market forces, with no institutional prerequisite, no fiat diktat. It must be considered, at minimum, one of the most fascinating human phenomena ever witnessed.  And so, 10 years on, begun as nothing more than the written word, first on paper and then in code, Bitcoin stands as proof of the pen's omnipotence, and of my early naiveté on the topic of its sharper counterpart. With luck and persistence, or perhaps inevitably, we may here seize upon this phenomenon and emerge — all of us — from one further delusion, from one of the darkest caves through which man has struggled.  Beyond the speculative fervor and the unending cynicism, through the chaos of newness and the elation of success… 10 years on and at least 10 more years to go, we must not forget why we do this.

42429889,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22hh,1540983612,October Close May Prove Decisive for Bitcoin Price,"Bitcoin's (BTC) monthly close today may reveal the cryptocurrency's directional bias after a long period of low volatility.  If prices fail to defend long-term support at the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $6,108, things may get tougher for BTC's bulls.  This is evident from the fact that price pullbacks witnessed in June, July, and September had ended near the EMA. Further, brief dips below that level quickly bounced back.  The price action suggests that the bears have likely run out of steam and BTC may have carved out a bottom close to $6,000.  However, that argument would lose credence if prices close today below $6,108, signaling a resumption of the sell-off from the record highs reached in December last year.  At press time, BTC is trading at $6,265 on Coinbase, having hit a two-week low of $6,211 on Monday.  Monthly chart  As can be seen above, the 5- and 10-month EMAs produced a bearish cross last month for the first time since 2014, meaning the bears are already in control here.  Hence, a close below the 21-month EMA will likely prove costly.  The prospects of a bullish reversal above $7,400 (September high) would improve if BTC defends the EMA support for the fifth month straight.  View  A bearish close below the 21-month EMA may allow a drop to levels below the June low of $5,777.  A defense of the crucial support would be encouraging, however, a bullish reversal would be confirmed only if BTC ends a series of lower highs with a move above $7,400.

42429877,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22Nh,1540978250,EY Reveals Zero-Knowledge Proof Privacy Solution for Ethereum,"""Big Four"" accounting firm EY has announced a tool that it says will bring private transactions to ethereum – that's the public blockchain, not a permissioned, enterprise version of the network.  The firm announced in a press release Tuesday that its EY Ops Chain Public Edition prototype (""with patents pending"") is the ""world's first"" implementation of zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology for ethereum.  ZKPs  are a cryptographic method that allows two parties to prove that a secret is true without revealing the actual secret. In the case of cryptocurrencies and blockchains, this is most often data about transactions.  EY's privacy prototype is aimed to allow companies to create and sell product and service tokens on the public ethereum blockchain while keeping access to their transaction records private. The firm said that the prototype supports payment tokens that are ""similar"" to ethereum's ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards.  ""Private blockchains give enterprises transaction privacy, but at the expense of reduced security and resiliency."" said Paul Brody, EY's global innovation leader for blockchain, adding:  ""With zero-knowledge proofs, organizations can transact on the same network as their competition in complete privacy and without giving up the security of the public Ethereum blockchain.""  Also included with the ZKP prototype is another solution – EY Blockchain Private Transaction Monitor – that captures transaction history.  Coming after the launch of the firm's blockchain apps and services platform EY Ops Chain in April 2017, the new prototypes are aimed to improve transaction efficiency and scalability, and address reluctance among enterprises to use public blockchains. The privacy offering is slated for production release in 2019, according to EY.  Also moving to adopt blockchain privacy technology in a traditional finance setting, ING Bank earlier this month launched a simplified zero-knowledge proof technology for potential use within banking processes.

This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" series.      This month marks not only the 10-year anniversary of the publication of Satoshi Nakomoto's now famous white paper, but it also marks a decade since the darkest days of the 2008 financial crisis.  With hindsight, the timing of the release of the bitcoin white paper and launching of the bitcoin network could hardly have been better. Did Satoshi Nakomoto at the time fully grasp the historical significance and unique opportunity presented in autumn 2008 to kickstart a new financial system and motivate people to use a new currency?  It is timely to reflect back on both these events, and how the two have evolved in the years since arguably the greatest global financial shock since the Great Depression.  The Post-Lehman Legacy of Ashes  The 2008 financial crisis reached its nadir with the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, just six weeks before Satoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin paper.  With the passage of time and post-crisis economic recovery, some may have forgotten just how serious the financial crisis was. In fact, Lehman's bankruptcy led to such a panic that famed Wall Street wizards like Pimco's Mohammed El-Erian asked his wife to withdraw cash over the fear that ATMs could stop working.  In the wake of the Lehman cataclysm, a number of initiatives arose that were aimed at preventing another financial crisis. New regulations and capital requirements like the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. and the Basel III banking standards were introduced. A second response to the crisis was socio-political, marked by the rise of movements like Occupy Wall Street.  What has been the lasting impact of these regulatory and social initiatives?  From our vantage point today in 2018 we can see that financial institutions like Lehman are not the only things that have been reduced to ashes. Many of the regulatory restrictions on financial institutions introduced post-crisis have been or are in the process of being eroded away, and social movements like Occupy Wall Street have long since fizzled out and faded into memory.  Given the lack of lasting structural and political reform, should we expect another financial crisis? The short answer to this question is an unequivocal yes.  The Next Financial Crisis  The economist Hyman Minsky developed a theoretical framework showing that reoccurring financial crises are an inherent feature of our current financial system. In other words, it is always only a matter of time before the next blowup.  Unfortunately for Minsky (and all of us), his theory was largely dismissed by the mainstream economics community and central bankers during his lifetime, leaving Minsky somewhat of a tragic Van Gough-like figure in the economics world. However, post-2008 his theory has at last seen the more favorable treatment it deserved by economists, and very few today would argue that some type of permanent 'great moderation' of financial instability is at all realistic.  Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen recently sounded the economic alarm, highlighting in particular the relaxation of loan standards, saying ""there has been a huge deterioration in standards; covenants have been loosened in leveraged lending"" and ""I am worried about the systemic risks associated with these loans."" There are numerous other unsettling developments roiling global markets today that may increase the likelihood of soon seeing another ""Minsky moment,"" although relatively subdued inflation provides central banks with some room to maneuver.  In markets, it is the timing, not the diagnosis, that is nearly always the hardest part to get right.  Right on the heels of Lehman's bankruptcy, a hitherto unknown figure named Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper on an obscure technology mailing list describing a new ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system"" that utilized a ledger secured with ""hash-based proof-of-work"" (or what we now refer to as a 'blockchain').  The bitcoin paper was initially greeted with skepticism by the handful of people who actually read it, and even after Bitcoin was operationalized on January 3, 2009, it was largely ignored for the first year of its existence. Bitcoin hardly got off to an auspicious start.  However, Bitcoin steadily attracted more use and interest, and a growing group of people began to see that the innovation created by Satoshi's solution to the long bedeviling 'double-spending problem' in computer science could also serve as a cornerstone for creating a new and better financial system.  As I suggested in 2014, regulatory reform would fail to fundamentally address the root causes of the financial crisis and other problems embedded in traditional finance. Regulations enacted in the wake of a crisis are too often easily rolled-back once the waters have calmed, and it can be difficult to sustain over time the momentum of social movements focused around obtuse subjects like financial system reform.  Instead, I argued that to truly fix the problems in our financial system we needed to change our problematic financial architecture, or 'plumbing,' as it is referred to by economists like Olivier Blanchard.  A new blockchain-powered financial infrastructure offers the possibility of long-lasting improvements and changes in the fundamental nature of our financial system. One particularly radical sea changes that Satoshi's invention makes possible is that in a blockchain-based system we 'the people' can effectively become the bank.  Coincidence or Master Class in Marketing?  Many of the details associated with bitcoin's creation, such as the explanation for why Satoshi chose Halloween as the actual paper publication date, remain unanswered.  What we do know is that such unanswered questions have generated immense curiosity, creating a durable mystique around Satoshi Nakamoto and attracting an unprecedented level of attention to his alternative currency. And the resultant publicity has arguably proven just as important to bitcoin's success as the underlying technical innovation.  In addition to computer science, mathematics, cryptography, and economics, we must also be sure to append the often-underemphasized skill of marketing to Satoshi Nakamoto's diversified CV.  What we also now know 10 years on, with the millions of rapidly growing users of cryptocurrency, is that for those interested in reforming the financial system Satoshi's invention of bitcoin and blockchain technology has proven to be the ultimate ""treat.""  And what about for the many banks and others invested in maintaining the financial system status quo? Was there some message Satoshi was trying to send to this group by publishing on Halloween 10 years ago?  Based on a number of other clues and comments left by Bitcoin's creator, I think we can pretty safely guess what Satoshi had in mind.

42429874,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22Hh,1540954825,19 Words Prove Just How Audacious Bitcoin Really Was,"Richard Gendal Brown is CTO at R3.  This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" series.      There is a phenomenon in anthropology called the ""Cargo Cult."" It was first observed in Melanesia in the late 19th century and most famously chronicled after World War II when remote Pacific tribes created pastiche airplane runways and mimicked long-departed air-traffic controllers in attempts to stimulate the return of military airdrops.  Cargo-culting consists of groups of people mistaking form for substance, latching on to an easily visible concept without understanding the underlying reason for its existence.  As we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the email that announced the birth of bitcoin, I have been reflecting on the prevalence of cargo-cults in the blockchain industry, what caused them and what we should do about it.  For example, many of the first business blockchain platforms broadcast all data to all participants, or coarsely-defined subgroups of participants. This isn't how business works – contracts should be private of course. But full broadcast was how bitcoin did it so it sometimes felt like those platforms 'cargo-culted' the same concept, even though it made perfect sense for Bitcoin but absolutely no sense at all for business. They have since revised their designs but, as a community, we should ask ourselves: how did that happen? Can we do better in the future?  Similarly, many business blockchain platforms run on something called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and require developers to program in a language called Solidity. Not because businesses want to learn entirely new languages but because that's how ethereum did it.  The problem is that, whilst the EVM was an amazing achievement, it was only ever a temporary stopgap: the Ethereum community publicly plan to abandon it in the near future. So it's hard to think of a reason for adopting it for entirely unrelated purposes, except perhaps for reasons of cargo-culting. This has real consequences: learning new languages costs money and technical decisions made by businesses last for a long time.  If these EVM-based business blockchains take root, one could imagine the world's business ecosystem could be running the EVM long after the platform for which it was invented had moved on!  This slavish adherence to one specific solution to one specific problem even extends to a core tenet of the enterprise blockchain revolution: the existence of blocks.  Satoshi Nakamoto didn't wake up one morning thinking: ""What the world really needs is for transactions to be batched up and confirmed slowly in blocks!"" No, bitcoin is a batch system because physical reality – the speed of light – means it's impossible to design it any other way if you also want to achieve the system's design goals around pseudonymous cryptoeconomically-intentivised consensus.  If Satoshi could have built a real-time system he would have done so.  So if you don't have some of bitcoin's requirements, what's the argument for why your solution should look identical and work like a 1960s batch mainframe computer?  An Example to Strive For  I've long argued that the world of enterprise blockchains will consolidate far faster than anybody expects, that a ""day of reckoning"" is coming. On this, the 10th anniversary of the paper that sparked bitcoin, we can, perhaps, use a worked example to see what we can learn from how Satoshi approached this question of design, a design that was truly novel, and free from cargo-culting.  Reproduced below is the email that announced the birth of the entire project. Its first line reads: ""I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.""  With that deceptively simple sentence, Satoshi Nakamoto announced the arrival of Bitcoin.  Captured in those 19 words was what amounted to a precise requirements specification. Not a cargo-culted replication of an inappropriate idea from the past, but a specific set of requirements, from which a specific design then followed.  Let's unpack some of those words to see how Satoshi did it.  Fully peer-to-peer: so no central computers.  No trusted third party: so the electronic cash must be intrinsic to the platform. (Otherwise you would have to trust the issuer.)  This also explains why there is such a focus on network participants running their own nodes: if you can't rely on software you operate and control, then you'd be reliant on a trusted third party.  Perhaps more importantly, the lack of a trusted third party also implies that the transaction confirmation providers - miners – cannot be forced to be identified or else the need for an identify provider reintroduces a trusted third party through the back door.  This deliberate absence of real-world identities means you can't implement ""one participant one vote"" so you need some other way to link to the real world. This leads to proof-of-work that layers one confirmation on top of the last which, in turn, means you have to give time for confirmations to propagate around the world which, in turn, leads to a need for batching, and hence the confirmations must come in the form of blocks. And so forth.  It's only a small exaggeration to say that the entire architecture of bitcoin unfolds inevitably and relentlessly from those 19 words.  You work through the details and the whole architecture falls into place.  Risks and Choices  In sum, bitcoin is an amazingly elegant solution to a very well specified business problem.  It's not without its problems, of course. And many of them are deep and fundamental: technical, environmental and cultural. But we can't underplay the scale of Nakamoto's achievement. Ten years on, the proliferation of ""blockchain technology"" would seem to suggest Nakamoto has been highly influential.  And yet… As I argued above, not all of the business blockchain platforms of today derive from a precise requirements specification and arduous engineering process. Instead, they feel very different. Some are, effectively, cargo-culted replicas of systems designed to solve very different problems.  The resolution of this problem lies in engineering.  To see what I mean, let's look at Corda, the open-source blockchain platform my team supports and maintains, with the help of a large and growing open-source community. I don't intend this piece to be a sales pitch – so I'll say up front that there are problems to which Corda is an amazing solution… and problems for which is it not! Study it for yourself – and apply it where it makes sense.  But that is also my point: Corda is an engineered solution to a specific problem.  It so happens that Corda shares a lot in common with other blockchain platforms (cryptographically chained transactions, byzantine fault tolerant consensus options, massive scale and far more). But it also looks different in some fundamental regards.  As a result, we in the Corda community have been criticized for these seemingly unconventional design choices. But I believe this criticism was misplaced. The reason platforms like Corda look different is because they solve different problems and were engineered from the ground up to solve them. The differences are a feature, not a bug, so to speak.  For Corda, our mission is to enable people and firms to transact directly, with legal certainty, settlement finality, strict privacy, and total assurance that ""what you see is what I see."" As a result, its design is different. For example, there is an identity layer, transactions are sent only to those with a need to receive them, transactions are confirmed one-at-a-time in real-time and so forth.  Those platforms that have identified a clear problem to solve and engineered a good solution to that problem are in rude health. Fresh off the back of the largest CordaCon ever, we head into 2019 with production deployments under our belts and large-scale adoption just ahead of us.  Thank you, Satoshi, for showing us the way.

The app downloads and installs parts of two different pieces of malware – EvilOSX and EggShell – both of which are backdoor applications that can be used to log keystrokes, steal data or execute certain commands. Malwarebytes director of Mac and Mobile Thomas Reed wrote that it is possible the malware was designed to steal cryptocurrency keys.  CoinTicker acts as a legitimate application designed to present the price of a selected cryptocurrency on request. The user installing the app can choose between bitcoin, ethereum, monero, zcash and others, according to a screenshot. However, the app also installs EvilOSX and EggShell in the background.  The app does not require root or other elevated permissions, meaning the user likely will not see any sign of infection.  It's unclear what specifically the app's creators want, but Reed noted that ""it seems likely that the malware is meant to gain access to users' cryptocurrency wallets for the purpose of stealing coins.""  The fact that the malware is distributed through a cryptocurrency app supports this theory, he wrote.  Malwarebytes for Mac now looks for the CoinTicker app, as well as its malware components, he added.

42429886,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM22bh,1540947504,"Crypto Wallet Maker Ledger to Expand Support for Stablecoins, Including Tether","Ledger, the hardware cryptocurrency wallet maker, plans to add support soon for more stablecoins, including expanding tether (USDT)'s usability across all its products and services, executives said.  Currently, the company supports tether for its two handheld storage products, the Ledger Nano and Ledger Blue, but it intends to add the U.S. dollar-linked cryptocurrency to its institutional vault service.  Despite USDT's recent loss of parity with the dollar amid renewed questions about its issuer's reserves, Benjamin Soong, Ledger's new head of operations for the Asia-Pacific region, said the token remains popular there.  ""One thing that is slightly unique in China and South Korea is the demand for USDT,"" said Soong, an alumnus of S&P Global Market Intelligence and Deloitte, whose hiring Ledger announced Wednesday. ""Since both of those countries have capital controls, in terms of your ability to move currency out of the country.""  According to Soong – who is opening the Paris-based Ledger's first Asia office in Hong Kong – Chinese and South Korean investors are often more comfortable with fiat-pegged currencies or assets that reflect traditional capital markets.  Even after it broke the buck two weeks ago, demand for USDT continues to dominate trading pairs on Asian exchanges like Huobi, where CoinMarketCap shows the volume is up nearly 26 percent in a single 24-hour-period last week.  USDT ""is a vehicle that is kind of unique in the market out here, that I've seen so far,"" Soong said.  Even beyond USDT, Ledger (which also supports MakerDAO's dollar-linked dai token) will also add other stablecoins as it pursues a major expansion of its custody business, with the goal of supporting more than 100 different tokens by the end of next year. Ledger President Pascal Gauthier told CoinDesk:  ""We have a big road of integrating many things right now, including stablecoins.""  New hire  As a capital markets veteran who speaks Mandarin, Cantonese, and Japanese, Soong was the ideal candidate to build out a 12-person team in Hong Kong and evaluate the potential of satellite offices in places like Japan and Singapore, Gauthier said.  ""You need to hire local talent, people who understand the local culture,"" Gauthier told CoinDesk.  Roughly 30 percent of Ledger's hardware sales already come from Asian markets, despite a previous lack of presence on the ground.  ""This is an asset class where the retail has really led the way, following by the institutional players coming in,"" Soong told CoinDesk. However, he added:  ""We're definitely seeing a lot of traditional asset managers and banks start to explore how they are going to enter and support this asset class moving forward.""  Yet when it comes to bitcoin, Soong said traditional asset managers across APAC still prefer to move their funds into crypto when custody solutions can offer the same security and trust level as banks. Hence, Ledger has an institutional custody partnership brewing with the Japanese bank Nomura.  ""They [wealth managers] would ultimately prefer to work with traditional financial institutions, which is why partnering with Nomura makes a lot of sense,"" Soong said.  Corporations, currency exchanges, and banks in Hong Kong have already started reaching out to inquire about crypto custody solutions, Soong said. ""Hedge fund managers, people who were in investment banking, are all moving into this space to help build up the infrastructure for this new asset class,"" he said.  Meanwhile, Ledger is also forging closer ties with the Hong Kong-based blockchain startup Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), led by ethereum cofounder Charles Hoskinson. Next week, during Hong Kong Fintech Week, Ledger and IOHK will host a joint party for the local crypto community.
