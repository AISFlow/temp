42430155,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMTUPh,1548886541,We Asked 66 Startups Just How Bad This Crypto Winter Has Been,"""Crypto winter"" has come and taken its toll on a number of prominent payrolls.  However, a survey by CoinDesk of 66 startups has found that the majority say they've managed to avoid serious setbacks or revisions to their product roadmap. Of the 45 who responded to the inquiry, 40 gave a generally positive prognosis about the coming year, though many came with caveats about further fundraising or hiring.  No one loves this market, the companies say, but it's not making founders abandon their projects just yet.  Brayton Williams, a co-founder of Boost VC, told CoinDesk:  ""The investment money is returning back to the norm of difficult to obtain. I think the 'winter' is greatly exaggerated. We are just back to normal behaviors.""  Boost committed to investing in 100 crypto companies back in 2014 and successfully reached that goal last year.  Treasury management  There were a variety of ways to go ""long"" on crypto yet avoid exposure. One dominant strategy: don't do an initial coin offering (ICO). In short, the prevailing wisdom is companies should build for crypto without exposing their payroll and rent money to its volatility. One advantage to going the route of traditional fundraising: the money comes in fiat.  Doug Petkanics of Livepeer, a decentralized video transcoding project, told CoinDesk that Livepeer has kept most of its capital in fiat, and therefore hasn't felt headwinds.  Petkanics wrote in an email:  ""The market drop affects the general ecosystem and sentiment around the space that we're working within. Projects don't get a free ride in terms of blockchain tech being seen as cool or disruptive amongst the general public.""  But many of the high-quality teams that raised funds via ICO are also managing to survive. Ricky Li, founder of Altonomy, a trading firm and advisory, told his ICO clients to liquidate enough ETH so they would have at least two years of runway.  ""A lot of people listened,"" he told us. Those that did don't care about the current market. Those that didn't, well, not so much.  Li also advised crypto believers to move a large portion of ETH they raised into crypto indices, so they aren't exposed to one asset. Some also bought options on their holdings in order to guarantee the price held in a certain range.  ""We were expecting an extended downturn as we were around for the last bear market,"" Matt Luongo, the project lead of Keep, told CoinDesk. Keep, a project from Fold for storing private data on blockchains, decided it would need to go beyond the protocol and build its first app as well, in order to spur adoption.  Trevor Koverko of security token firm Polymath told CoinDesk that his company went in with a good treasury-management plan and he's been happy with the results.  Said Koverko:  ""Our technical roadmap has been accelerated. We view the bear market as a blessing for quiet, heads-down, development-focused projects.""  There's another way to make sure a company's core ideas live on, of course.  One investor, Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares, hopes market forces will rally to save the best parts of faltering companies. She wrote via email: ""I do hope more companies decide to merge and join forces, especially if competing for the same wallet share, to build more cohesive user experiences and increase the chances of success.""  Additional funding should be there for companies that prove their worth, Demirors argued, adding:  ""In this environment, most companies with a reasonable business model, some proven traction, and a reasonable valuation should be able to find support in various forms.""  Employers' market  There's a strong ""buy"" rating on BUIDL right now.  Koverko and several founders told us the bear market has slightly improved employers' bargaining position in terms of hiring blockchain engineering talent. As some projects wind down, there's a broader talent pool available.  ""We view this as a great time to pick up talent and build great technology, much like Google and Amazon got their head start during a bear market,"" Josh Fraser of Origin Protocol wrote in an email.  It is worth noting, though, that not everyone said hiring is easier. Robert Leshner, CEO of the venture-backed Compound Finance has had a different experience. ""Candidates are by default skeptical of blockchain right now,"" he said.  Fortunately, Leshner has enough runway to make it for several years, he told CoinDesk. This is key because he expects his core early customer base to be crypto funds, and many of those are closing down.  For example, CoinDesk has confirmed that a token fund-of-funds, Apex Token Fund, that had announced its intention to raise $100 million in November ultimately never hit its minimum funding target. The failure to raise took down the vehicle created for the fund.  Trimming the fat  Several companies still standing tell CoinDesk the time has come to cut back on more outward-looking expenses. Several firms told us about cutting back on events and public-relations expenses.  ""We feel that it is a waste of time and money to travel all over the place while the audiences are small and dwindling,"" Marco Peereboom of Company 0, which leads development on the Decred Protocol, told CoinDesk in an email.  Other companies told us that they've been cutting back on contractors, PR firms in particular. Compound Finance's Leshner is seeing a similar diminished interest. ""I get invited to a lot less conferences,"" he wrote.  Beyond marketing, companies are getting more internally focused, as well. Nebulas was one company still holding on that has had significant cutbacks. A spokesperson told CoinDesk that it jettisoned some internal teams that were not seen as central to the mission. Erik Voorhees of ShapeShift sounded similar themes when he announced his firm's contraction in early January.  Surprising survivors  Some companies have gone long on ETH and managed to keep going.  We recently wrote about Bee Token, a would-be competitor to Airbnb that's now driving revenue through traditional fees, rather than the original plan: fostering growth in its token's value.  Some companies used the power of smart contracts to give their ICO backers more power, but that cost them in flexibility during a bear market. For example, The Abyss, a crypto startup in the video-game industry, gave its backers the ability to vote on how much ETH to release to the team every month, a model first-conceived by Vitalik Buterin, who called it a decentralized autonomous ICO, or DAICO.  The upshot of this: they couldn't sell the locked ETH for fiat if they wanted to, and – as the price of ETH plummeted – every new emission of funds was worth less than the one before it.  ""Despite that, we managed to provide all the key deliverables in accordance with the project's roadmap and declared timeline. All points were executed,"" founder Konstantin Boyko-Romanovsky told CoinDesk in an email. He expects the winnowing of token companies to ultimately benefit the blockchain industry.  The Abyss currently employs 25 people on its development team, with a full staff over 60.  Netflix challenger Flixxo has most of its funds in ETH, so the downturn hasn't been easy. Still, its founder, Adrián Garelik, told CoinDesk that Flixxo believes there's a rare opening in the streaming industry for a token-based business model.  Garelik said:  ""We feel there is a time-sensitive opportunity and we’d rather spend all our resources and take the opportunity than waiting for a better moment for crypto. It’s a bet, but we have a lot of confidence in our vision.""  Without additional funding, the company has one year to realize that vision, Garelik said.  Mild winter forecast  Peereboom was among the sources who compared today to the last major bitcoin contraction.  ""It doesn’t quite feel like 2014 because ICOs raised so much money, but the space is not done consolidating,"" he said.  New token sales aren't over, either. TokenSoft, which helps companies conduct compliant offerings, expects to do a solid business this year. ""We have several raises still ongoing and expect our clients collectively to raise more than $1 billion in 2019,"" Stacy Orff-Whitfield, the company's head of marketing, told CoinDesk.  To that point, crowdfunding platform Republic announced its intention to do a token sale in June, but that has remained on hold and may sit for some months more, CEO Kendrick Nguyen confirmed.  Once a token has been generated, the market raises another question.  Harmony COO Nicolas Burtey said his company faced the quandary of when to start pushing for token listings. ""On one side, we really need to have our token to build our community,"" he told CoinDesk. ""On the other side, we presume that if we list the sell pressure might be high and will have a negative effect on the project.""  Random Crypto, a mining company headed by Josh Metnick, is expanding quickly. ""Best time to mine is when difficulty stagnates and prices on gear are reasonable,"" he wrote to CoinDesk. Coinmine, the company aiming to bring back home mining, gave CoinDesk a similar assessment.  Beyond mining, Williams, the co-founder of Boost VC, remains confident about the entire industry. He wrote:  ""This 'winter' is 100X better than the 2014/15. People don't think crypto is going to die. They are all just trying to time for when it comes back. In 2014/15, the conversation was all about if crypto survives at all.""  UPDATE (31 January 14:51 UTC): A previous version of this story gave an undercount of the full team size of the Abyss.

42430154,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMTURh,1548874828,Ripple Hires General Counsel from Lending Giant CIT Group,"Ripple has hired a new general counsel, filling a position that had been vacant for several months.  Announced Wednesday, Stuart Alderoty will oversee all legal work at Ripple and manage its global legal, policy and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) compliance teams, reporting to CEO Brad Garlinghouse.  Alderoty joined Ripple from CIT Group, a top-50 U.S. bank and commercial lender, where he held the jobs of executive vice president, general counsel/chief legal officer and corporate secretary since 2016, overseeing legal, corporate governance and insurance risk management matters, according to Bloomberg. Prior to CIT, he served in executive positions at HSBC and American Express, after 17 years working as a lawyer.  He succeeds former general counsel Brynly Llyr, who left Ripple in September to join the crypto payments startup Celo.  A busy legal team  Alderoty's hiring comes at a time when Ripple is in the midst of fighting a consolidated class action brought by investors who claim they lost money on XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, and accuse the startup of selling the coin as an unregistered security.  The lawsuit combines several class-action lawsuits filed by plaintiffs Avner Greenwald, David Oconer and Vladi Zakinov, naming as defendants Ripple Labs and its subsidiary XRP II, Garlinghouse, and several other executives and directors. In November, the lawsuit was moved to a federal court by defendants' motion.  Last fall, Ripple started a lobbying group in Washington, D.C., dubbed the Securing America’s Internet of Value Coalition (SAIV) and aiming to influence the regulation of the crypto space.  Also in September, Ripple settled a two-year-old old legal dispute with R3 over part of the partnership agreement signed in 2016 which granted R3 the right to buy up to 5 billion XRP tokens for $0.0085 each through the end of 2019.

42430156,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMTUNh,1548867605,The Next Big Ethereum Conference Will Run Almost Entirely on Blockchains,"The largest ethereum-based hackathon is gearing up for its second annual run in Denver, Colorado – and this time, nearly every aspect of the event will make use of blockchain technology.  Everything from applications to attend ETHDenver to the processes for submitting, judging and voting on projects will be supported in some way through one (if not multiple) blockchain platforms, Hannah Oreskovich, the conference's communications steward, told CoinDesk.  While the event is free for approved attendees, applicants can stake a certain amount of ether to have their applications reviewed faster, for example. The ether will be returned when attendees check in at the event.  Perhaps most notably, the Feb. 15-17 gathering will host an end-to-end payments systems created in collaboration by a number of notable blockchain startups including MakerDAO, Status, POA Network, Solidcoin, SendWyre, Quantstamp and Gitcoin.  “Every attendee will receive their own unique web wallet that will be pre-loaded with a localcoin called buffiDai, which is pegged to the Dai, and will be used to drive the ETHDenver economy,” the organizers said in a press release Wednesday.  Similar to last year’s Colorado Coin, buffiDai will be used by attendees to pay “for food, swag, drinks, activities and [non-fungible tokens],” the press release said, adding that vendors will be able to quickly redeem the token for fiat currency that will be sent straight into “their own bank accounts” via SendWyre’s payments processing technology.  Billed as “the first, real-world, large-scale, ephemeral crypto-economy,” the anticipated launch of the buffiDai at ETHDenver will feature use of the xDai wallet created by Austin Griffith, director of research at ethereum bounties platform Gitcoin.  The xDai wallet, unlike most other cryptocurrency wallets, is specifically engineered for quick and temporary use. By scanning a QR code that attendees will find embedded on a physical coin in their “swag bag,” the wallet will run directly on a user’s native phone web browser.  “As soon as the web page loads, people can walk right up to a food truck, scan a code from a menu, and walk away with a hot dog,” the press release said.  Speaking to CoinDesk about the innovation, John Paller, the executive steward of ETHDenver, said that in his view “the huge collaboration” between different blockchain projects to create this pop-up economy was “the most interesting” aspect of the whole endeavour.  “This was a fascinating experiment and collaboration …. We had a goal and I went to these guys and I said, ‘Look, here’s what I want to build. Here’s what we learned from last year. Here’s what worked and what didn’t work. What can we do?’” Paller said. “And before you know it, people were just joining this effort, contributing and volunteering their time.”  Crypto made easy  Adding to this, Richard Brown, head of community development for MakerDAO, described the contributions of select blockchain projects to the payments system.  “Status wallet will support the buffiDai token for attendees who are looking for a more secure way of holding their localcoin,” Brown told CoinDesk. “POA Network helped ensure we had a fast and secure blockchain to power the system … Quantstamp happily jumped in to audit our contracts.”  Elaborating on the “integration help” from SendWyre to “off-ramp” buffiDai holdings into vendors' bank accounts, Brown said each buffiDai token would be worth exactly one U.S. dollar and that user onboarding to participate in this system would be done strictly “through scanning a single QR code.”  “This project is all about ease-of-use. We’re trying to solve the [user experience] issue many people have when trying to engage with crypto for the first time,” explained Brown. “This whole experiment is predicated on finding a balance between security and convenience.”  With success, Brown predicts that the same model can be applied for all “localized, short-lived economies looking to support local vendors and suppliers like festivals, farmers markets or conferences” down the road.  This year, however, ETHDenver is expecting a surge in event attendance.  Despite being “in the middle of a crypto winter,” Paller told CoinDesk that at present there are over 2,000 expected participants to the conference, which last year drew roughly 1,500 attendees.  “I think the reason for that is we’re a developer-facing event, not an investor-facing event,"" he said.  The four main themes for this year’s ETHDenver being “society and systems, going mainstream, business and capital 3.0, and developer tools,” Paller emphasized that the goal “is to not just educate people but really give them a fully experiential event so that they can get a glimpse into the future of what crypto is going to be like.”  Are you ready for Art DAOs?  One of the ways attendees will not only experience blockchain technology but actually see it will be through the annual “Art Maker Space.”  Created through a collaboration with blockchain scalability and interoperability platform Truebit, along with MIT Media, a physical geodesic dome will host generative art pieces called “art decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)” representing data on a blockchain.  Operations and creative lead at Truebit Jessica Angel explained to Coindesk:  “Art DAOs – think of them like artificial intelligence forms of art. So you can create computation power that generates images [using Truebit technology].”  Workshops will be led for “hackers and builders” alike to leverage newly designed developer tools by Truebit to explore “the intersection of art and blockchain” and create their own unique pieces of artwork.  “It’s this fun way to play around with the tools that can be difficult [to understand.] It’s kind of like easy-ing the blockchain and the technical cerebral part of it using art,” Angel said.  Explaining that Maker Space will “primarily be used to educate people and make blockchain accessible through art,” Angel echoed sentiments from both Paller and Brown about the importance of collaboration in the blockchain space.  Looking ahead, Paller predicted:  “I think [collaboration] is going to be more commonplace of the kinds of ecosystem tools that we build. I don’t think we’re going to see silo-based development in examples of highly successful [crypto] ecosystems.”  ETHDenver 2018 Maker Space image via Truebit.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MKR | SPONSORED,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/30/the-next-big-ethereum-conference-will-run-almost-entirely-on-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/381a5ccdac3ac5a8f8b9cc061f7d88f5f55844fb-1500x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Blockchain data analytics firm Elementus said in a blog post Tuesday that Cryptopia's hacker, after going quiet for some days, has stolen an additional 1,675 ether from 17,000 wallets – an amount worth about $181,000 at the time of writing.  While initially it looked like Cryptopia might be moving cryptocurrency to secure the remaining user funds, the ether were being sent to an ethereum address used by the hacker previously, said the firm, adding:  ""The hacker has the private keys and can withdraw funds from any Cryptopia wallet at will.""  Elementus also said that some wallets are still being topped up, suggesting that not all users know of the breach.  “Most of the funds are coming from mining pools,"" the firm added. ""Presumably, these payments are being sent on behalf of miners who opted to receive their rewards automatically via ‘direct deposit,’ and have since forgotten about it.""  Last week, Elementus published another analysis indicating that about $16 million worth of ether and ERC-20 tokens had been stolen from Cryptopia wallets.  The exchange, though, hasn’t released any information on the amount of loss to date. It went offline on Jan. 15 citing a major hack that resulted in “significant losses.”  Since then, New Zealand Police has been investigating the case, stating that it is keeping an “open mind” on the possibilities.  On Jan. 22, the police issued an update saying that ""good progress"" is being made and ""positive lines of enquiry are being developed to identify the source of the transfer, and to identify where the cryptocurrencies have been sent.""

42430159,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMTUZh,1548856801,Crypto Lender Genesis Capital Processed Nearly $1.1 Billion In 2018,"Institutional crypto loans firm Genesis Global Capital says it processed more than $1.1 billion in lends and borrows in 2018.  The firm, which is affiliated to Genesis Global Trading, published its latest ""Digital Asset Lending Snapshot"" Wednesday, announcing that it had more than doubled its loan originations in the last three months of 2018, compared to the previous six months. The company processed $500 million in loans between March and October 2018, and again between October and the end of December.  The firm said in the report, ""Over the past year, through client feedback and the rise of derivative marketplaces, we saw a meaningful increase in the number of market participants wanting to borrow and/or lend digital currencies.""  Genesis CEO Michael Moro cited the crypto bear market as one possible factor in the company's revenue, explaining that the demand for loans in both cryptocurrencies and fiat grew dramatically last year, particularly for those shorting cryptocurrencies. The company's fiat product is new, going live only in Q4.  According to the snapshot, by the close of 2018 the company had processed $638 million in loans and $475 million in borrows, with $153 million in active loans.  The majority of the company's loan portfolio was bitcoin (about 60 percent), with nearly 20 percent of the portfolio including XRP and the remainder constituted through other cryptocurrencies.  The snapshot provides ""a more in-depth look"" at Genesis' loan book, including by highlighting certain trends that the company's analysts examined.  The most interesting trend, Moro noted, was a sort of counter to the narrative that short sellers are responsible for various cryptocurrencies seeing falling prices last year.  The company examined ethereum in particular as one example of a cryptocurrency that traders shorted, and found that rather than short sellers causing ethereum's price to drop, the opposite was true:  ""The short sellers tend to wait for the price of ethereum to go down before they get in, they're not the catalyst ... What they do is they piggyback ... Short sellers probably exacerbate the magnitude of the selloff [but] they joined the crowd, they didn't start the crowd.""  Moro referred to these short sellers as ""momentum traders,"" explaining that ""they wait for the momentum to start"" before they begin shorting the cryptocurrency.  ""Depending on the price action in 2019, that will dictate, at least early on in the year, what happens, and will people continue to be willing to borrow for shorting if the price is stable. Maybe, if the price is rising, probably not likely, if the price is falling, yes"" he added.  He noted that the company has not had to lay off any employees through the bear market, as other firms have, explaining that part of this comes from Genesis hiring slowly, rather than hiring large blocks of individuals in a short period of time. Rather, the company now plans to grow its team, including by hiring developers and expanding to Europe and Asia, he said.  As the crypto market recovers – which Moro estimates may take years – he believes the market for Genesis will become larger, despite any drop-off in short sellers.

Announcing  the news on Tuesday, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss-founded Gemini claimed to be the first crypto firm to have successfully completed the System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 1 examination.  “SOC 2 examinations are specifically designed to address controls at a service organization relevant to the systems at the service organization used to process users’ data,” according to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  Gemini said Deloitte independently inspected and evaluated the design and implementation of its security controls to ensure it meets the trust services criteria set by the AICPA, which includes ""security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality or privacy"" of the controls.  “This included a review of Gemini’s exchange application, infrastructure, and underlying customer database, as well as its institutional-grade cryptocurrency storage system that custodies the private keys of Gemini’s online and offline wallets,” the firm added.  Gemini said it is also committed to clearing the SOC 2 Type 2 examination this year to ""further validate the effectiveness of our internal controls,"" and will take SOC 2 exams on an annual basis.  The difference between Type 1 and Type 2 examinations is that the former requires a report of a service organization’s internal controls at a specific point in time, while the latter requires it over a period of time.  Last month, Gemini also published an attestation report from auditing firm BPM to validate that it held fiat currency to back its stablecoin, the Gemini Dollar (GUSD).

42402550,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKIoO,1548846923,Bitcoin Eyes Minor Price Bounce But Bear Trend Intact,"View  Bitcoin's minor recovery rally from six-week lows could be extended further to levels above $3,500 as back-to-back long-tailed daily candles are indicating a lack of conviction among sellers, despite Monday's high-volume range breakdown.  A break above the downward sloping 10-day MA of $3,511 would expose the crucial resistance of $3,658 (the high of Saturday's gravestone doji and last week's classic doji candle). The outlook would turn bullish if BTC secures a convincing UTC close above $3,658.  Rejection at the 10-day MA would reinforce the primary bearish trend and could yield a quick drop to the December low of $3,122. On the way lower, BTC may find support at the 200-week moving average of $3,298.  Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered slightly from six-week lows seen yesterday and could see a short-term corrective bounce to $3,500.  The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading at $3,416 on Bitstamp, having hit a low of $3,322 on Tuesday – a level last seen on Dec. 17.  The 2.8 percent recovery could be associated with the oversold readings on the short duration technical indicators seen 24-hours ago. Moreover, Monday's high-volume range breakdown and the drop to multi-week lows had pushed the relative strength indices on the hourly and 4-hour charts below 30.00  With the minor rally, however, those RSIs have moved back to undersold territory and are now in line with the bearish view put forward by a convincing break below $3,500 seen on Monday.  Even so, the drop to December lows near $3,100 may not happen immediately as stronger signs of temporary bearish exhaustion have emerged on the longer duration charts.  Daily and 4-hour chart  As seen above, BTC has reported losses in the last five trading sessions – the longest losing streak since mid-November.  Notably, the ascending triangle breakdown on the 4-hour chart confirmed on Monday signaled a resumption of the sell-off from the Jan. 10 high of $4,036. The 5- and 10-day MAs are trending south and the 14-day RSI is reporting bearish conditions with a sub-50 reading.  So, the doors look to have been opened for a drop to December lows near $3,100.  The cryptocurrency, however, may test bears’ resolve by rising to the bearish 10-day MA of $3,511, as the long-tails attached to the previous three daily candles signal a lack of conviction on the part of the bears.  A long-tailed candle occurs when there is a big gap between the daily low and UTC close, that is, when sellers fail to secure a close near the lowest point of the day.  3-hour chart  The bullish divergence of the RSI and the falling channel breakout indicate the sell-off from the high of $3,658 has likely paused. BTC, therefore, could rise to $3,500 and above.  The outlook, however, will remain bearish as long as BTC is held below $3,658 (the high of Saturday’s bearish reversal candle).

42402537,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKIfX,1548844847,Glyph Partners With 3 Crypto Firms for Accredited-Investor Checks,"Decentralized identity startup Glyph is partnering with a trio of digital securities companies to make their approaches to ID verification more convenient – particularly for accredited investors.  “Our technology handles any identity use case but we are very focused on accredited investors,” founder James Greaves told CoinDesk. In short, Greaves hopes accredited-investor checks become as easy as ordering a book on Amazon (the e-commerce giant's first use case).  Revealed to CoinDesk, Glyph’s technology is being integrated by Polymath, Swarm and Dealbox – three sites for managing digital securities. It’s the first announcement to date from Glyph, which was launched in 2017 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Greaves says Glyph will soon announce up to six additional partners.  Identity has become a crowded space in crypto, with companies like Civic, Sovrin, uPort and others offering ways for users to control how their information is shared online.  “Identity is one of the most important missing pieces of Web 3 infrastructure,” 1confirmation investor Richard Chen wrote in a recent overview of the space.  Yet with some ID efforts facing adoption challenges, Greaves says Glyph’s approach is intentionally targeted.  “Let’s just start with accredited-investor checks,” Greaves said. “Most identity companies try to come in and own the whole piece.”  For Polymath, Glyph becomes one of two services for verifying accredited investors, the high-net-worth individuals who by law have greater leeway in investing in securitized assets. By most estimates, roughly 10 million households in the U.S. meet the income criteria required of accredited investors.  Polymath’s Graeme Moore says integrating third-party services makes it easier for people to interact with the platform, which is used to launch tokens that comply with current securities laws.  “When you have to get your accreditation status checked every 90 days that can be a real pain,” Moore said. “Glyph does a better job than most solutions we’ve seen in terms of allowing investors to control their own identity.”  Social Security card image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/30/glyph-partners-with-3-crypto-firms-for-accredited-investor-checks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dad6507fb42eea7fb4e204710efdef211be4fb48-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402533,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKIac,1548843979,SWIFT Chief Announces Trial DLT Integration With R3,"SWIFT, the global banking payments network, is to begin testing its GPI payments standard through R3's Corda platform.  Speaking on stage at the Paris Fintech Forum this morning, SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt said: “Later today we are announcing an integration with R3.”  In a follow-up announcement, the firm explained that the ""integration"" will be a trial that will connect SWIFT's GPI Link gateway with R3's Corda platform to monitor payment flows and support application programming interfaces (APIs), as well as SWIFT and ISO standards.  ""SWIFT GPI will integrate directly to Corda Settler, the application that allows participants on the Corda blockchain to initiate and settle payment obligations via both traditional and blockchain-based rails,"" explained R3 co-founder Todd McDonald. ""This will enable obligations created or represented on Corda to be settled via the large and growing SWIFT GPI network.""  In the trial, corporates using the R3 platform will be able to authorize payments from their banks via GPI Link; GPI payments will be settled by the corporates’ banks, and the resulting credit confirmations will be reported back to the trade platforms via GPI Link on completion.  While the trial initially addresses R3’s trade environment, it will be extended to support other distributed ledger technology (DLT), non-DLT and e-commerce trade platforms.  David E. Rutter, CEO of R3, said in a statement:  “Following the recent launch of our Corda Settler, allowing for the payment of obligations raised on the Corda platform, it was a logical extension to plug into SWIFT GPI. SWIFT GPI has rapidly become the new standard to settle payments right across the world. All the blockchain applications running on Corda will thus benefit from the fast, secure and transparent settlement provided through the SWIFT gpi banks.”  Luc Meurant, SWIFT’s chief marketing officer, added: “All trade platforms require tight linkages with trusted, fast and secure cross-border payments mechanisms such as GPI. While DLT-enabled trade is taking off, there is still little appetite for settlement in cryptocurrencies and a pressing need for fast and safe settlement in fiat currencies.""  Meurant said that, via GPI Link, banks will be able to provide rapid, transparent settlement services to e-commerce and trading platforms.  ""Given the adoption of the Corda platform by trade ecosystems, it was a natural choice to run this proof of concept with R3,” he added.  At the event Wednesday, Leibbrandt was onstage with Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, which has long coveted SWIFT’s expansive banking network and often cites its aging architecture.  In December, R3 launched the Corda Settler, an application aimed to facilitate global cryptocurrency payments within enterprise blockchains and which would use Ripple’s XRP to start.  R3 said at the time that XRP was the first globally recognized cryptocurrency to be supported by Settler, bringing the Corda and XRP ecosystems into closer alignment – something of a rapprochement considering Ripple and R3 were previously locked in a legal dispute.  Update (12:30 UTC, Jan. 30 2019): SWIFT has clarified CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt's statement to CoinDesk, saying that the integration is a proof-of-concept at this stage. The headline has been amended to reflect the new information.

42402551,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKImQ,1548840693,Fujitsu Claims 40% Efficiency Boost for Blockchain Electricity Exchange,"Japanese IT giant Fujitsu has developed a blockchain-based system for electricity exchange between enterprise consumers that aims to facilitate a more stable energy supply at peak periods.  Announcing the news on Wednesday, Fujitsu said it had tested the ""patent-pending"" blockchain system with support from electric power distribution company ENERES and achieved a roughly 40 percent improvement compared to an existing system called demand response (DR).  DR lets electricity consumers help balance the demand and supply of power by reducing or shifting their electricity usage during peak periods and receive incentives in return. But DR needs to be improved, Fujitsu said, explaining that power aggregators – effectively, the energy middlemen – currently interact with electricity consumers on an individual basis to achieve power-saving targets.  Fujitsu's blockchain-based system, on the other hand, is said to quickly calculate how much energy is available from sellers and match that with available buy orders in order to receive a faster response at peak times.  The firm added that it has built technology that can fulfill the orders without wasting energy.  Fujitsu has built several blockchain-based tools and systems in the recent past. Back in October, the firm developed an inter-bank settlement system using the tech in an attempt to achieve low-cost transfer of smaller transactions.  And, last June, the firm launched a blockchain-based data storage system that can be used by retail merchants to tokenize traditional promotional tools such as coupons and reward points.

42402545,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKIkS,1548837029,This Spongebob-Themed Tech Proves That Bitcoin's Lightning Is Advancing,"“Wumbology, the study of ‘wumbo’. It’s first grade, Spongebob!”  For the uninitiated, that's a quote from the Nickelodeon animated series Spongebob Squarepants. Spoken by the jolly starfish Patrick Star, it describes the word “wumbo” – to which the eponymous character responds: ""I don't think that's a real word.""  Well, thanks to some up-and-coming technology built on bitcoin, Star is looking to be correct.  Pinched from the cartoon, the term wumbo now describes one of the next milestones for bitcoin's lightning network, the payments layer bitcoin developers are heads-down on in order to solve the digital money's biggest problem: that it only supports a few users right now – let a worldwide ecosystem.  ""I wumbo, you wumbo, he, she, me wumbo,"" Star explains further.  Don’t let the silly name fool you. The change, which for the first time would lift the hard-coded limit on how much money can be locked up in a lightning channel at a given time, demonstrates just how far the lightning initiative as a whole has come.  When lightning launched so users could make real transactions for the first time earlier this year, developers advised caution, arguing that doing so is ""reckless"" because lingering bugs could lead to lost funds.  Of course, many users, excited for the technology, have been using it anyway. Now, 574 of bitcoin – worth about $2 million – is stashed away in lightning channels, up from 1 bitcoin at the beginning of 2018.  And yet, because it was so ""reckless"" to use, developers imposed a limit on how much bitcoin can be locked into a channel: 167.77216mBTC, which is worth just under $600 as of press time.  Wumbo, on the other hand, once implemented, would allow users to remove the limit if they so choose.  This name was chosen in November at a ""summit"" in Adelaide, Australia, where lightning's top developers gathered to discuss the future of the technology, including improvements they could make to make the technology easier for end users to easily make payments.  “Please blame one of the persons attending the summit for this term. Unfortunately, due to rules imposed, non-attendees can only learn who to blame if that person admits this,” wrote ZmnSCPxj, a pseudonymous developer who codes for the c-lightning implementation in his spare time.  The meeting followed Chatham house rules, meaning participants can share information with others that they learned at the meaning, but ideas and quotes are not allowed to tied to a particular individual. This is generally a policy implemented to encourage developers to speak freely.  But the fact that whoever came up with the name isn't publicly known doesn't make the technology any less important.  Wumbo shows that lightning as a whole has progressed far enough that developers, as cautious as they are, think lightning ready – or at least, getting is closer to ready – for bigger transactions.  I wumbo, you wumbo  The update is pretty easy to understand.  When a user decides to make payments to other users, there will be a new option, ""option_i_wumbo_you_wumbo"", allowing users to open a channel with more bitcoin than is imposed by the current limit. That said, this can only occur if the two sides agree to an expansion of the limit.  This approach is presumably how the feature got its name: “I wumbo, you wumbo."" In other words, each user must agree to ""wumbo.""  Once all code implementations update their software with this new option (there are three main ones in use right now), users will be able to do this with just about anyone else on the lightning network.  ""A node that advertises ‘option_wumborama’ allows any node to build channels with capacity above the limit,"" ZmnSCPxj explained further.  Opening a channel is kind of like opening a bank account. With Wumbo, users can then open channels as large as they want, as long as they have the money to fund it.  Again, the code change itself is not so interesting. The cool part is that users and developers can look forward to a time when channels have bigger capacity.  Can’t stop the wumbo  To be clear, though, lightning users aren’t going to be able to “wumbo” overnight.  It's been added to the new version of the lightning specification, 1.1, as discussed in Adelaide, but all the changes still need to be coded up.  And although Wumbo itself is a fairly easy change, ZmnSCPxj said that it’s unclear how long this process will take since developers are working on a variety of things: like fixing bugs, building watchtowers for security, and trying to improve the UX. The overarching goal is that everyday spenders can one day make use of the payment technology without blinking.  “It seems vaguely unlikely that anyone will be defaulting to [Wumbo] in the immediate future,” Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo told CoinDesk.  They’re at least laying the groundwork, he went on to say: “But defining it in the protocol is a step towards allowing users to opt-in.”  Once Wumbo is coded up, there’s nothing really stopping users from using it. Since users have been using lightning for real payments — to the tune of $2 million — despite warnings against it, ZmnSCPxj wouldn’t be surprised if users tap the capabilities of Wumbo the first chance they get.  “Users are reckless anyway,” he said.  ZmnSCPxj guessed that the code might go through “within this year,” but didn’t give a firm deadline for the code change with the silly name.  When asked what they thought of the name choice, ZmnSCPxj responded:  ”Wumborama. It is first grade, Alyssa.”  Spongebob Squarepants image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/30/this-spongebob-themed-tech-proves-that-bitcoins-lightning-is-advancing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ab75367dcdd13385ec29cc13a66f14d6adec7c8-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
