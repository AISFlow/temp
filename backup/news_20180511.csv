42401533,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczwGd,1526065248,'Utility' No More? ConsenSys Pitches 'Consumer Token' Label,"The Brooklyn Project – the token regulation initiative headed by ethereum startup ConsenSys – wants to dispense with the concept of ""utility tokens"" in favor of what it calls ""consumer tokens.""  The Project discussed its intention to shift the discourse at the Fluidity Summit on Thursday during a presentation by ConsenSys' policy lead Pat Berarducci and OpenLaw's Aaron Wright.  According to a document published by the Project, the initiative broadly aims ""to provide a basic framework for long-term oriented behavior and to help establish trust between the initiators of consumer token projects, their collaborators, their customers, and the public at large.""  More specifically, it makes recommendations on project objectives, practices and legal disclosures.  The framework defines consumer tokens as those lacking ""equity ownership, a predominant interest in a fund, passive-earned dividend rights, or other characteristics of a financial instrument."" Likewise, they must be ""consumptive in nature.""  ""We want to confirm that people want to be using the tokens these developers are developing,"" said Wright during the presentation.  He argued that the term ""consumer token"" better describes cloud storage and collectibles among others, which feature what is now commonly referred to as a ""utility token.""  The Project crucially intends to facilitate a discussion that addresses both centralized and decentralized token projects - the latter of which fits less seamlessly into existing legal and regulatory regimes, the document claims.  That said, consumer token projects may still encounter the same problems facing ""traditional legal entities and markets – problems such as trust, cooperation, fairness, and safety,"" the document contends, adding:  ""The framework represents a first step towards establishing standards for consumer tokens by addressing these problems head-on, without assuming the presence of centralized organizations or intermediaries.""  Wright and Berarducci indicated that the Brooklyn Project hopes to spur a collaborative, community-wide conversation about both token standards and regulation with the aim of ameliorating the current deficit of trust caused by scams, phishing and market manipulation.  ""Ultimately we see a future for effective, decentralized, self-regulatory structures,"" Berarducci said. ""Most people in this industry, they really want to do the right thing.""

42401542,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczwQT,1526058031,Most Big Cryptos Dropped this Week – These Two Bucked the Trend,"The cryptocurrency markets are set to end the second week of May on a low note.  The total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies fell below $400 billion for the first time since April 26 on Friday, and has dropped 15.97 percent week-on-week. As of writing, the combined market value stands at $385 billion and could see a further decline as indicated by a head-and-shoulders breakdown pattern on the price charts.  Looking at notable individual cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (BTC) has depreciated by 12 percent week-on-week and has outperformed its closer rivals. For instance, ethereum (ETH) and EOS have dropped 15 percent each and Ripple (XRP) has declined by 34 percent.  Bitcoin's dominance rate, which represents its percentage of the total market capitalization, moved above 38 percent for the first time since late April. This likely indicates that money is possibly being rotated back into bitcoin from alternative cryptocurrencies, so BTC's relatively good performance this week is not surprising.  Names like NEM (XEM), stellar (XLM) and cardano (ADA) are ranked higher on the list of biggest losers among the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  The only gainers this week are two lesser-known cryptocurrencies: bytecoin (BCN) and zilliqa (ZIL).  Top weekly gainers  Bytecoin  Weekly performance: +32.70 percent  All-time high: $0.0186  Closing price on May 4: $0.006733  Current market price: $0.010005  Rank as per market capitalization: 17  Bytecoin (BCN) picked up a bid on Tuesday and rose to a fresh record high of $0.01862, according to CoinMarketCap, seemingly due to cryptocurrency exchange Binance's decision to list the cryptocurrency.  As of writing, BCN is changing hands at $0.010 – down 46 percent from record highs, but still reporting a 35 percent week-on-week rise.  Daily chart  The pullback from the record highs has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook. That said, the ascending (bullish) 5-day and 10-day moving averages (MAs) indicate the bulls are still in the game. Only a daily close (as per UTC) below $0.006 (May 8 low) would signal a bullish-to-bearish trend change.  Zilliqa  Weekly performance: +13.84 percent  All-time high: $0.2306  Closing price on May 4: $0.132311  Current market price: $0.153565  Rank as per market capitalization: 23  Zilliqa (ZIL) is the latest entrant in the list of cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of more than $1 billion. The cryptocurrency clocked a record high of $0.2306 on May 10, according to CoinMarketCap. Its BTC-denominated exchange rate rose to a life-time high of $0.00002508 BTC yesterday and was last seen at 0.00001847 BTC on Binance.  Daily chart  Currently, the downside is being capped by the ascending (bullish) 5-day MA. The 10-day MA is also biased bullish.  However, the relative strength index (RSI) is turning lower from the overbought zone, so prices might find acceptance below the 10-day MA (currently seen in 0.000016) next week and signal bullish invalidation.  Biggest weekly losers  NEM  Weekly performance: -40.42 percent  All-time high: $2.09  Closing price on May 4: $0.431269  Current market price: $0.307124  Rank as per market capitalization: 14  NEM (XEM) fell sharply this week and is currently trading below the 50-day MA located at $0.3241, according to Poloniex.  The news flow during the week has been somewhat positive, though. For instance, Abra, the global app that allows you to buy, store, and invest in 25 cryptocurrencies, has added XEM to its platform. Further, NEM's appearance at CoinDesk's Consensus blockchain conference in New York from May 14–16 is being touted as its biggest event and has generated investor interest.  However, all that has failed to put a bid under XEM prices. It appears as though the technical failure around the $0.45 mark seems to have enticed the bears.  Daily chart  The rounding top pattern, the 5-day and 10-day MA bearish crossover and a break below the 50-day MA, as seen in the chart above, suggest scope for a further drop towards to $0.22–$0.19. The RSI is also biased to the bears and is well above the oversold territory (above 30.00), backing up the likelihood of a drop in XEM prices.  Stellar  Weekly performance: -40.22 percent  All-time high: $0.9381  Closing price on May 4: $0.43114  Current market price: $0.374065  Rank as per market capitalization: 8  Stellar (XLM) has taken a beating this week, having created multiple doji candles signaling bull exhaustion in the daily chart last week. As of writing, XLM is looking weak, courtesy of a convincing break below the key support of $0.32 and the 5-day and 10-day MA crossover. The daily RSI is also trending south, indicating a bearish setup.  So, the cryptocurrency looks set to clear the 200-day MA support, currently seen at $0.29. A close below the long-term average would expose support lined up at $0.258 (Feb. 6 low). Only a daily close (as per UTC) above $0.32 (April 25 low) would abort the bearish view.  Cardano  Weekly performance: -40.02 percent  All-time high: $1.33  Closing price on May 4: $0.360182  Current market price: $0.257219  Rank as per market capitalization: 7  Cardano (ADA) is moving more mainstream via a new partnership with Metaps Plus, one of the largest payment platforms in South Korea.  However, so far the good news has not been able to put a floor under ADA prices. ADA/USD fell to $0.2475 today – the lowest level since April 18 – and could extend losses further, courtesy of the bearish setup as seen in the chart below.  Daily chart  ADA seems to have found acceptance below the 100-day MA and the bearish bias would strengthen further if it closes (as per UTC) below $0.255 (April 25 low). The RSI is trending south and still well short of the oversold territory (hold above 30.00).  So, there is room for a further drop towards $0.18 (March 9 low). Only a daily close above the 10-day MA (seen today at $0.332) would abort the bearish view.

42401528,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczwBi,1526054378,"IBM, Global Citizen Seek Blockchain Solutions for Humanitarian Aid","IBM and Global Citizen are issuing a challenge to the world’s developers: use blockchain to revolutionize how donations are made to humanitarian causes.  The tech giant and the anti-poverty campaign movement are partnering on “Challenge Accepted,” inspired by the United Nations’ Envision 2030 initiative, which aims to improve the lives of impoverished and at-risk people.  Developers taking part in Challenge Accepted will use IBM’s Blockchain Platform Starter Plan to build a network that encompasses all aspects of the donation process.  There’s a gamification aspect as well – along the way, developers who perform certain actions can earn “points” that they can then redeem for access to IBM experts, for example.  Stepping back, the UN and other assistance groups have previously explored using blockchain to track aid to impoverished areas. Cryptocurrencies, too, have served as a platform for facilitating donations to a range of causes, from clean water access to the provision of electricity for a school in South Africa.  And in what is perhaps the most notable trial of its kind to date, the World Food Programme (WFP), the food assistance arm of the United Nations, tapped the ethereum blockchain to authenticate and record disbursement transactions.  More than money  Simon Moss, a co-founder of Global Citizen, argued in a blog post published Friday that the technology has the potential to change the face of humanitarian aid.  And it’s not just the money that would be better accounted for, he said – organizations can use a blockchain to improve transparency in the flow of goods being delivered as well.  “Blockchain can provide clarity on not only who is donating, but how money and supplies flow through organizations that provide aid – such as tracking a gallon of water purchased by an organization to the location where it was delivered,” he wrote.  Kathryn Harrison, who leads product management for the IBM Blockchain platform, told CoinDesk that the initiative grew out of internal conversations earlier this year about the “opportunities to use this technology in areas that we can do some pretty substantial social good.”  “I think it’s a really exciting opportunity to help engaged citizens see how they can build something that’s going to drive accountability and improvement in the [non-governmental organization] sector,” Harrison said.  A link in the chain  Harrison also framed the challenge – which runs from May 15 to July 14 – as part of the wider work being done at IBM on the blockchain front.  “We’re focused on so many different types of use cases. We look at food safety, we look at microfinance, we look things like the environment and carbon credits and energy savings,” she explained. “And this just seems like another opportunity to empower developers to put their skills to use for good.”  At the end of the challenge, five winners will be chosen from the pool of contestants. Harrison said some of the projects may be listed in the IBM Blockchain Platform, opening up those templates to other users – and winners could potentially take their projects further through IBM’s Garage workspaces. The winners will also receive tickets to Global Citizen’s Global Citizen Music Festival in September.  The challenge is an opportunity for developers looking at aid-focused uses of blockchain to advance their ideas – but as Moss contended in his blog post, there’s a bit more at stake here.  He concluded:  “This is a bold reinvention of how philanthropy and donors interact.""

42401539,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczwNW,1526043627,This Crypto Vending Machine Can Tell If You're 21 And Sell You Beer,"""We're definitely not in the beer-vending business.""  That might not be something you'd expect the marketing manager for a crypto tech company to clarify, but it's perhaps now necessary when discussing Civic, the startup co-founded by entrepreneur and ""Shark Tank South Africa"" star Vinny Lingham in 2016.  Announced Friday, the San Francisco-based startup will unveil the world's first ""crypto beer vending machine"" at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 next week. No gimmick, Civic sees the prototype, built and branded in partnership with beverage giant Anheuser-Busch, as a way to demonstrate the utility of blockchain-based identity verification schemes.  In short, any conference attendee will be able to walk up to the machine with their Civic app, where they can verify whether they are of legal age and make a purchase.  Civic's Titus Capilnean told CoinDesk:  ""We've been thinking about practical ways of bringing crypto technology to a more mainstream audience, and how can we go so so niche that it's so easy to understand for a regular individual. Proof of age seemed like the best low-hanging fruit.""  In this way, Capilnean argues the model also circumvents issues with using traditional ID verification techniques in such settings, including being equipped for the variety of IDs consumers might use, as well as the handling of data transmitted or stored in the verification process.  Going even further, the demo illustrates how blockchain technology could one day enable the makers of all kinds of age-restricted products to move into the vending machine market.  ""It's not limited to just beer, it could be for any kind of age-restricted product. Unmanned entrance to casinos, and then for the vending machines, we can see this going into concerts, ballgames, venues, conferences,"" he said.  Still at present, that future might be some ways off.  While the prototype is now said to be in transit to the New York Hilton for the event, it's the first and only in production by the company, and there are no plans at this time for either Civic or Anheuser-Busch to move forward with any wider distribution.  Civic said the machine will aim to release up to 600 free beers daily at the conference.  Where the token fits  Still, there are additional considerations for Civic aside from marketing.  Looking ahead, the demo also provides a glimpse of how a wide range of devices could soon be connected to Civic's identity marketplace, now scheduled for a Q3 launch.  Announced last June, Civic sold $33 million-worth of its CVC tokens to investors ahead of an initial coin offering (ICO) for its protocol that saw more of its custom cryptocurrency dispersed to users. Today, the value of the network is $113 million, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  As described by Lingham last year, the idea was to enable banks and other entities that store and safely hold the data necessary to verify users to offer up their ability to provide a kind of know-your-customer service.  So, the tokens, while not necessary for the demonstration (the beer distributed at Consensus 2018 will be free of charge) could be integrated into later iterations. Essentially, vending machines that need to verify that an ID is valid will need to purchase Civic tokens in order to enact the query and verify the blockchain data.  ""In this case, the machine requesting the identity will have to pay for the verification,"" Capilnean explained, concluding:  ""Everyone contributes to the token economy, the service providers pays for the IDs, the validator gets the ID and the consumer gets the product.""

42401536,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczwJa,1526040005,Maximalist for Hire: Bitcoin Believer Pierre Rochard Starts Advisory Firm,"Don’t judge a self-proclaimed bitcoin maximalist by his trollish tweets.  At least not Paris-born Pierre Rochard, who many have surely dismissed because of his bombastic Twitter account, which he routinely uses to diss ""altcoin"" fans for ""peddling trash."" But to disregard him would be to miss the nuanced theory behind his quips.  “Obviously, there are other currencies that exist today,” Rochard, a 29-year-old accountant turned self-taught software engineer, told CoinDesk. As such, “it’s a bit of a strawman to say that bitcoin maximalists think there will only be one currency. The reason crypto is zero-sum is [because] money, in general, is zero-sum.”  In his analysis, global economies typically have one currency by which others are measured or held in reserve, whether it be gold or dollars. Rochard believes bitcoin is becoming that global store of value and transactional medium for the digital world, especially since other cryptocurrencies appear to be “heavily dependent"" on it as a reserve currency.  So while other blockchain experts are launching multi-coin crypto hedge funds or freelancing as consultants for the tokenized fundraising projects known as initial coin offerings (ICOs), Rochard just launched Bitcoin Advisory LLC in Brooklyn, N.Y. – call it the maximalist consultancy.  Rochard wants to provide a variety of prospective investors with unadulterated insight into bitcoin.  But unlike with a traditional financial advisor or fund manager, clients are only paying for Rochard’s time. His advice, then, won’t be motivated by wanting people to invest through him or in anything offered exclusively by his company; to the contrary, he wants clients to walk away with the tools to manage their own investments.  “I do want to also present the case against investing in bitcoin or at least being more cautious about its valuation or more rigorous about analyzing the risks of investing in bitcoin. I don’t want investors going all in on bitcoin,” Rochard said, adding:  “I think that’s the worst possible thing they could do, even though that might not make me popular on Twitter. There needs to be a cautious portfolio approach to bitcoin.”  In fact, Rochard’s wife, a financial planner herself, insisted their “very boring” retirement funds exclude high-risk investments like bitcoin.  Objectivity needed  This idea that people shouldn't trust third parties and instead empower themselves fueled Rochard's passion for starting Bitcoin Advisory LLC in the first place.  According to him, the thwarted ""New York Agreement,"" in which a group of miners and businesses proposed ultimately unpopular changes to the bitcoin software, highlighted a dire need for independent advisors in this space. Since one aspect of the update was related to keeping transaction fees low for these corporate players, Rochard believes they had a vested interest to support the agreement, even though developers were worried about the effects of that change.  “These CEOs are the main liaison between institutional investors,” Rochard said. “I want to unbundle the information from the financial product.”  Of course, as a bitcoin maximalist Rochard isn’t completely objective.  But he may perhaps have less conflict of interest than a service provider that benefits from pushing users and investors to certain cryptocurrencies, for example.  At least, in his mind:  “They [startup CEOs] are the ones providing views on the bitcoin ecosystem. As such, they have an effect on the way investors think about bitcoin. Their companies have an agenda with regards to bitcoin.""  Rochard said his fidelity belongs solely to bitcoin and related projects like the lightning network, the technology many bitcoin developers are working on which looks to push transactions off-chain so that bitcoin can scale to more users in time.  Community building  In his new role, investors who want to run their own bitcoin nodes will find Rochard to be a particularly eager educator. And it's definitely an area where expert advice could help, since running a full node can be one, quite the setup, and two, technically challenging,  But for Rochard, it's a crucial activity in helping users to fully realize bitcoin's potential, and ties into his engineering work (he's created several tools to tally and organize access to new contributions to Bitcoin Core software on Github).  “What I want to see from my own contributions to Bitcoin Core is to help accelerate the development of Bitcoin Core’s wallet,"" he said.  Because the open-source wallet relies on Bitcoin Core nodes, which broadcast and tally transactions for bitcoin miners to validate, in contrast to lighter software wallets like Jaxx or Bread, which only facilitate transactions, Rochard said this is the best way to be fully in control of your money.  Speaking again to his interest in weening people off third-party systems, Rochard said, “I generally want people to be running a full node regardless of the implementation it’s in because we’ve seen a lot of reliance on third parties.""  The new consulting gig isn't Rochard’s first crack at launching a project geared towards educating people on bitcoin.  For instance, he co-founded the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute in March 2014 with two fellow alumni of the University of Texas at Austin, Michael Goldstein and Daniel Krawisz. The institute is essentially a free archive of reading materials related to money and cryptography from as far back as the 1970s, including a collection of emails from bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  More recently, Rochard and Goldstein started the Noded Bitcoin podcast, where they interview leading developers and bitcoin community influencers.  Speaking to his love of bitcoin, Rochard told CoinDesk:  “There’s so much to research in bitcoin alone. After five years, I’m still peeling the bitcoin onion.""

Bitfury, which also provides bitcoin mining hardware, first unveiled Crystal in January, offering a way for firms and law enforcement agencies to track transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.

""If law enforcement agencies had had the proper tool to find criminals on the Bitcoin Blockchain,"" the company said in a presentation, ""they could have quickly cornered the criminals and prevented further global damage.""

42401530,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczwDg,1526032809,White Shoe to Wild West: Lawyers to Launch Blockchain-Only Law Firm,"Blockchain technology is shaking up the legal industry.  At least that's according to prominent blockchain industry attorneys, Angela Angelovska-Wilson and Lewis Cohen, who revealed exclusively to CoinDesk Friday that they have started their own law practice focused on the nascent industry.  Called DLx Law LLP, the firm opened its doors this month, with offices in New York and Washington, D.C. Its founders, Angelovska-Wilson, previously general counsel and chief compliance officer at enterprise blockchain startup Digital Asset, and Cohen, a seasoned securities lawyer, aim to run the firm differently than the typical law practice, in a way that aligns better with the culture of the blockchain space.  For example, they eschew the term “partner,” because in their view it fosters a sense of possession over clients or cases. Instead, lawyers will assume responsibilities based on their skills, not seniority, Cohen told CoinDesk.  More concretely, and like a few other law firms with cryptocurrency clients, DLx accepts payment in bitcoin or ether. And down the road, it would like to rethink the age-old practice of charging by the hour and experiment with smart contracts and other unorthodox ways of being paid for legal services.  For now, though, the founders say an exclusive focus on blockchain technologies will help the new firm assess risk with surgical precision. Prospective clients include startups, exchanges and token issuers.  “Inherently, it was very clear to us the challenges in providing clients the kind of services that they need within a very large law firm,” Cohen said. “A week in blockchain time is like a month anywhere else.”  One such dramatic shift occurred this spring when the public conversation suddenly turned to the question of whether two of the top three cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, ether (ETH) and XRP, are securities under U.S. law.  The speculation was fueled in part by remarks made by former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Gary Gensler, now an academic, but also by reports that Silicon Valley venture capitalists were lobbying regulators behind closed doors to give ether a safe harbor.  Cohen, who was most recently a partner at Hogan Lovells, said concerns about ether being retroactively designated a security four years after issuance are “somewhat overblown.""  “I’m aware of some of the arguments that can be made. But there are a variety of good legal reasons why ETH should not be considered a security at this time, not least of which is the hard fork that occurred following the DAO debacle,"" he explained, adding:  ""The ETH that everyone trades today was not the ETH that was originally crowdfunded. It’s a fork of that chain.”  Immediate help  Cohen’s decades of experience navigating global capital markets complements Angelovska-Wilson’s technology focus. (She represented several early investors in the fintech startup Circle and first transacted with bitcoin in 2012.)  The duo plans to hire up to five additional lawyers by summertime, as more than 40 prospective clients – including Colleen Sullivan, the CEO of trading and financial services firm CMT Digital and general counsel of ethereum-focused startup ConsenSys, Matt Corva – have already requested immediate help.  “I’ve found, especially over the past six months, that lawyers sometimes don’t get the backing [from firms] we need,"" Corva told CoinDesk, suggesting this issue is compounded by the opaque regulatory environment and conflicting interests related to other clients outside the blockchain industry. ""That’s why I’m very excited that Lewis is opening up this firm that’s solely focused on blockchain.”  At the same time, DLx Law will cooperate with larger law firms as part of its collaborative ethos.  “We have forged what I’ll call informal alliances with a number of practitioners in the space that our clients can be referred to, and we can work collaboratively together on any of the issues that are facing our clients,” said Angelovska-Wilson, adding:  “We do feel that the provision of legal services in the blockchain era will be different, and we want to be the thought leaders who develop new ways of practicing law.”  For example, Cohen said he could imagine the firm having developers on staff someday.  “We wanted the firm’s philosophy to be more aligned with our clients in terms of decentralization,” Cohen said. “Something we certainly have in our roadmap is working with developers to develop products for our community.”  Focus on smart contracts  In the meantime, the duo is particularly intrigued by the nascent OpenLaw project, an ethereum-based platform that turns regular legal contracts into software that can automatically execute an agreement such as trading shares or transferring real estate ownership.  Whatever form they may take, DLx wants to play a role in bringing smart contracts to life.  “Legal services could be provided much more efficiently in a lot of ways,” Cohen said. “Blockchain-based solutions for clients will be an important part of our development.”  Of course, such unconventional contracts will face unique challenges when made across jurisdictions, especially since prospective clients from China have already reached out to DLx.  As a long-term aspiration, Angelovska-Wilson said she would also like to use smart contracts to experiment with flexible pricing for legal services, based on supply and demand and on the unique requirements of projects. Here again, there are complications, since some states in the U.S. forbid payment in advance for legal services at a set price, but Cohen said DLx is looking for solutions to such obstacles.  Yet Angelovska-Wilson framed the idea as consistent with the ethos of the blockchain community, saying:  “The billable hour undermines the value lawyers could really bring to the table with respect to these projects. It also hinders the ability of lawyers to be a part of the business process and the development of new products, services, ideas, things like that.”  Sheriff badge via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/11/white-shoe-to-wild-west-lawyers-to-launch-blockchain-only-law-firm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f397463f5eae35c1dc77ebd016001eba45d07874-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42401541,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczwPU,1526031021,"Bitcoin Hits Three-Week Low, Eyes Break Below $8,600","Bitcoin (BTC) hit a three-week low of $8,713 on Bitfinex earlier today and looks set to extend losses further, price chart analysis indicates.  The cryptocurrency failed to cut through the descending (bearish) 5-day moving average (MA) located at $9,382 yesterday, despite the bullish falling channel breakout on May 9, and fell below the $9,000 mark as anticipated.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands around $8,800 – below the 100-day moving average (MA) of $8,849 and down 2.42 percent from the previous day's close (as per UTC) of $9,018.  The 10 percent decline from the recent high of $9,990 has weakened the bulls and has boosted the odds of a deeper drop to the 50-day moving average lined up at $8,282.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows BTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday below $9,149 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement), pushing indicators into bearish territory.  For instance, the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped below 50.00, confirming a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change and opening the doors for a further drop in prices.  The 5-day MA and the 10-day MA are both trending south, having witnessed a bearish crossover earlier this week.  4-hour chart        On the 4-hour chart, BTC has breached the trendline support in a convincing manner, and the 50-candle and 100-candle MAs have topped out (shed bullish bias).  The cryptocurrency looks set to test the gradually ascending (mildly bullish) 200-candle MA located just above the $8,628 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement, seen in the daily chart). However, the moving average support may hold ground for a few hours as the relative strength index (RSI) shows oversold conditions.  1-hour chart  The 50-hour MA, 100-hour MA, and 200-hour MA are trending south and positioned one below the other in favor of the bears. Yet, the RSI on the 60-minute chart also shows oversold conditions. So, a minor corrective rally cannot be ruled out.  View  Bitcoin will likely break below $8,628 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement), signaling the end of the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 and may fall to $8,282 (50-day MA) at the weekend.  BTC could revisit $9,000 as indicated by the oversold conditions 0n the 4- and 1-hour charts. That said, upticks will likely be short-lived as indicated by generally bearish setup.  Bearish invalidation scenario: A rebound from the mildly bullish 200-candle MA located at $8,628 in 4-hour chart and a close above 10-day MA of $9,390 would abort the bearish view.

42401540,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczwOV,1526008277,Ethereum Co-Founder Battles 'Dr Doom' Roubini to Crypto Debate Draw,"Nouriel Roubini was in full attack mode in his latest crypto debate.  ""The entire crypto land is more unequal in terms of income and wealth than North Korea,"" he said Wednesday afternoon, and the jabs didn't stop there, with the former Clinton administration economist, better known as ""Dr. Doom"" for his prediction of the 2008 financial collapse, taking his criticism of all things crypto to new levels.  Still, this was perhaps to be expected. After antics onstage at the Milken Institute Global Conference earned him headlines, the organizers of the Fluidity Summit invited Roubini to go toe-to-toe with ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin, with Roubini playing the bear to Lubin's bull.  Long a cryptocurrency basher, Roubini didn't make a different case this time, though his arguments were perhaps distinguished by their breadth and energy. (The moderator, former COMEX Chair Donna Redel, even went so far as to use a whistle on him at one point to rein in the conversation).  Alleging various miners, exchanges and cryptocurrencies have cultish followings, Roubini argued against the idea cryptocurrencies are decentralized, positing that these groups tend to have significant sway over the development direction a protocol takes.  Roubini told the audience:  ""The whole point of the crypto world is to say we don't believe in central banks … everything is going to be decentralized. I see totally the opposite in crypto land.""  As expected, Lubin came to the industry's defense with point-by-point counter examples that articulated a broad thesis for how blockchain will enact change.  ""We're building systems that are fundamentally, atomically about collaboration,"" Lubin said.  It was a capstone conversation to a day of cheerleading institutional investment in crypto. Perplexingly, some of Roubini's toughest barbs seemed to thrill much of the crowd, though it's hard to tell if this represented real sentiment or if crypto enthusiasts just love a good show.  Nevertheless, investor Jehan Chu of Kenetic Capital saw the crowd as very much on team crypto.  He told CoinDesk:  ""This isn't winning hearts and minds. Everyone is here to do business.""  Peace Offerings  And much of this is a credit to Lubin, who was more nuanced onstage, granting imperfections but attempting to couch them as technological waypoints rather than insoluble problems.  Lubin tried to even concede to Roubini on some of his smaller points. For example, he took on mining, saying, ""I agree that the mining systems are susceptible to centralization.""  Promising that a proof-of-stake protocol for ethereum should be deployed soon, he said it will enable people to replace all that hardware infrastructure with ""a bond, an economic bond on the blockchain."" He even argued that it will be more secure than bitcoin's pioneering proof-of-work system.  In this way, some of the earlier panelists pointed to some of the very difficult challenges decentralization presents. Stefan George, the CTO and co-founder of Gnosis, a prediction market whose early 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) hinted at how big the year in crypto would be, expressed frustration at working with a slew of wallets with different configurations. ""We all need to agree on one API,"" he said.  And Alex Wearn of IDEX spoke more broadly to the competitiveness of decentralized applications. ""It's not going to happen unless usability pretty much matches the centralized experience.""  Roubini was less circumspect. He said that the dapps on the market are by and large pyramid schemes.  Each time Lubin described progress, Roubini dismissed it out of hand. For example, he argued that the crypto-iluminati have been saying for years that scaling problems could be fixed.  ""I'll show you the code,"" Lubin offered. It was probably his biggest applause moment of the whole debate.  In another example, Roubini said ""cryptocurrency"" was a misnomer because it's not really money. To be money, he argued, it has to be a unit of account, a means of exchange and reliable store of value.  Lubin countered by pointing out that MakerDAO has made a stable coin on ethereum that has, he said, something like $1 billion dollars in value in it. Even as ether tanked early this year, the MakerDAO token held steady at its peg with the dollar.  Roubini, however, was hardly impressed.  So who won?  Still, surprisingly, if the winner were measured by who got the most big laughs or big rounds of applause, it would go to Roubini.  In fact, Roubini's biggest moment probably came when he first pointed out that there was no good reason for a business to limit customers with a token. He asserted that if every company only accepts tokens for its goods or services, there will be no way for people to know how to compare prices.  ""You're going into a world of 'The Flintstones' or barter,"" Roubini said. ""It's totally inefficient. It's never going to work""  That's not to say Roubini was the only one in the room with doubts, though he may have been the only one committed to them. Even Lubin didn't miss his chance to say something about forthcoming regulatory action, but he spun it the same way as everything else: a speed bump on the way.  ""Although there will be some negative news around some of the projects that sold tokens, there will also so be some good news, and we will see a lot of that in 2018,"" he said.  But again and again Roubini argued that ethereum itself should start policing scams and kicking them off the platform now, not addressing how that would run fundamentally counter to the censorship resistance ideology engineered into these platforms. But it did reflect the core idea that all of his arguments stemmed from.  He said:  ""I do believe in centralization.""  So even if Lubin did win the debate, it seems clear he could never win over Roubini. Nor could Roubini ever win over him. That fundamental ambivalence, one widespread among smart people during what Lubin called ""exponential times,"" was well captured by another crypto diehard at the end of a prior panel.  ""Some of this could be permanent that we're putting on a blockchain,"" Samantha Radocchia of the supply chain company Chronicled said. ""I'd like to encourage thinking about that.""  Roubini v.
