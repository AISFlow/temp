42399669,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNrd,1489445464,Bitcoin Traders Weigh New Risks as Scaling Returns to Spotlight,"With the SEC's bitcoin ETF rejection just days behind the market, bitcoin traders saw a familiar topic return today – the technology's long simmering scaling debate.  After two years of debating the best way to address the challenges associated with bitcoin's 1 MB block size, the digital currency's community has so far failed to develop the consensus for any particular solution.  While Segregated Witness is now available for miners and nodes to vote on, the proposal (one long favored by its development team) has thus far failed to obtain the signaling needed for approval from miners. This has taken place as the number of transactions on the network has surged, leading a vocal contingent of the business community to aggressively seek solutions.  Yet, the situation took a decisive turn earlier today when Bitmain, the operator of Antpool, the world’s largest bitcoin mining pool, announced that it would switch its entire mining pool to Bitcoin Unlimited, a bitcoin implementation that would aggressively expand the block size.  Following this announcement, analysts have grown increasingly concerned that the bitcoin network could undergo a hard fork – a development that, if handled poorly, could create two separate bitcoin assets.  As such, traders voiced concern about the issue, with investor and Civic CEO Vinny Lingham stating simply:  ""The next big milestone will be ensuring that a hard fork does not happen.""  Two bitcoins  Among traders, the prevailing fear is that a situation could arise whereby one side is effectively able to enact a change that would find network nodes and miners split into two versions of the blockchain history, divided by alternative features.  Such a situation is not without precedent. Last summer, the ethereum blockchain experienced a controversial hard fork, a development that resulted in a minority of users creating the alternative ethereum classic blockchain.  Henry Brade, co-founder of physical bitcoin supplier Denarium, went so far as to advocate that trades liquidate their holdings in the event of such a development.  ""If bitcoin splits, I recommend selling everything and buying back later. It's a trust failure much larger than MtGox. Big haircut expected,"" he wrote on Twitter.  Lingham later expanded on his statement, espousing his belief the situation will end poorly should a fork occur.  Adding to uncertainty is that the long-term impact of a fork is not well understood, though data from ethereum's two blockchains provides some insight.  Rangebound bitcoin prices  Amid this uncertainty, bitcoin prices have fluctuated within a reasonably tight range today, trading between $1,216.31 and $1,247.26, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  At the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $1,239.83.  Bitcoin hedge fund operator Tim Enneking summed up the situation as one where various parties in the technical and business community are beginning to get ""impatient"" for a solution that would boost scalability.  He suggested the market is now in wait-and-see mode, but that there could benefits to one technical solution winning out, as long as two bitcoin assets don't emerge.  ""A resolution (regardless of who prevails) will almost certainly push the price to new highs,"" he said.  This relative calm contrasts with the sharp volatility that bitcoin prices experienced in the last several days, as the digital currency reached an all-time high of more than $1,325 before the SEC's ruling on the proposed bitcoin ETF.  Prices then plunged nearly 30% to roughly $1,022 when the government agency rejected the plan, though the digital currency has since recovered.

42399658,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNhn,1489433532,UK Government Eyes Blockchain Trials in New Digital Strategy Push,"The UK government said it envisions a role for blockchain as part of a broader digitization plan unveiled earlier this month.  The Department for Culture, Media and Sport published its ""UK Digital Strategy for 2017"" on 1st March, outlining a number of policy initiatives related to supporting digitization efforts in the country’s private sector. It highlighted work at the Digital Catapult Centre, through which government officials would seek ""new ways to work with personal data with more control and trust… [and] applications of blockchain and smart contracts"".  While it didn’t go deeper into detailing what that work might entail, the strategy outline indicated that it would look to support applications in the manufacturing, healthcare and creative content sectors.  Karen Bradley, Secretary of State for digital affairs, said in a statement that officials would look to foster more communication between the public and private sectors as the UK government pursues its digitization drive.  Bradley said:  ""I hope [the strategy release] will mark the beginning of a new phase of close engagement between Government and the tech sectors, and am looking forward to working side-by-side to make our digital economy both stronger and fairer.""  The publication also indicates that the UK government is looking to expand its investment of time and resources into the tech, perhaps building on a January 2016 report from the UK Government Office for Science that called on greater exploration into blockchain.  Since then, officials have tested the tech for tracking welfare payments and testing the disbursement of student loan funds via distributed ledger. The government has also solicited companies working with blockchain for a startup competition in the fall.

42399660,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNim,1489425612,EU Draft Law Outlines Parliament Plan to Monitor Bitcoin Users,"EU Parliament members have published new draft legislation outlining their plans to regulate digital currencies.  Legislative language published on 9th March details how MEPs plan to empower financial watchdogs in the EU, allowing them to collect more data on digital currency users. What's more, it sets the stage for the creation of databases in which wallet addresses would be linked to particular identities.  At one point, the language declares that, in the view of the Parliament, ""virtual currencies should not be anonymous"".  The legislation, if finalized and approved, would also create the conditions for national-level financial intelligence gatherers to share that information once obtained.  The draft bill – prepared by the EU Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as well as the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – states:  ""To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currencies. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed.""  The release comes more than a year after the EU Commission, the executive arm of the economic bloc, moved to propose measures that would impose anti-money laundering controls on the digital currency space. Last year, too, members of the EU Parliament moved to create a task force, led by the Commission, focused specifically on the tech.  According to public records, 88 committee members voted in favor of the legislation, as opposed to one objection and four abstentions.

42399659,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNjl,1489420958,The Market Cap of All Crypto Assets is Up $4 Billion Since Friday,"Bitcoin markets aren't the only ones on the rise in the wake of the SEC's exchange-trade fund (ETF) listing rejection.  Perhaps in response to the publicity that has followed, the price of the digital currency rose back above its pre-ETF rejection levels this morning, days after US regulators deflected a bid to get the Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss-backed fund's shares listed on the Bats BZX Exchange.  Yet, market data suggests that other digital currencies are seeing significant price gains this morning. All told, the across-the-board capitalization for the digital currency market is up roughly $4.59bn since the market low on Friday, shortly after the SEC had issued its rejection, CoinMarketCap figures reveal.  Ether, the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, is up more than 30%, climbing as high as $30 on some exchanges. According to CoinMarketCap, trading volumes have exceeded $200m worldwide in the past 24 hours.  Likewise, dash has continued a price increase trend to climb to over $70. And privacy-oriented currency monero is averaging $18 at press time, representing a climb of about 22% in the past day. Even older digital currencies such as namecoin and peercoin have seen significant price increases today, rising by 135% and 40%, respectively, as of press time.  As observed by some market observers, digital currency markets saw price increases broadly in the wake of the decision, suggesting that volumes are being driven at least in part by increased exposure for the industry at large.

42399654,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNeq,1489410904,Arizona Senate Holds Up Blockchain Gun Tracking Bill,"Proposed legislation that would prevent the use of blockchains to track guns in Arizona has been temporarily blocked, public records show.  Early last month, House Bill 2216 was introduced with the aim of prohibiting any system that ""uses a shared ledger, distributed ledger or blockchain technology or similar form of technology or electronic database"" from being used to keep track of firearms. The bill was put forward by state representative Paul Boyer.  While the bill itself does not stipulate how a particular gun might be overseen remotely, the idea is that hardware sensors could be used to catalog whenever it is fired or loaded.  Despite a successful 34-25 vote in the Arizona House of Representatives in mid-February, the bill has hit a procedural roadblock that has effectively held it from further progress. On 8th March, according to public records, the Senate Government Committee opted to hold the bill, freezing the measure.  The bill's seeming failure comes on the heels of a successful vote in New Hampshire on a proposal to exempt bitcoin traders from money transmission regulations. The bill, introduced in late January, passed by a margin of 185-170, and now heads to the state senate for further consideration.  Combined, the updates show the diverse nature of the current US regulatory environment toward the emerging technology.

42399657,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNgo,1489407642,Foxconn Reveals Plan for Blockchain Supply Chain Domination,"One of the world's largest tech employers is now in the blockchain business.  Foxconn – best known for manufacturing Apple's iPhone – last week demonstrated a blockchain prototype that resulted in $6.5m in loans being originated to members of its massive supply chain. The company has since laid out plans for a global network of nodes that could help non-bank lenders make direct loans in supply chains globally.  Called Chained Finance and operated as a separate entity, the spin-off project is designed to connect non-bank lenders with suppliers who don't typically deal directly with financiers, according to Jack Lee, CEO of Foxconn financial subsidiary FnConn.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Lee further elaborated on the savings that he believes could eventually result from cutting out commercial banks and other third-party money-suppliers.  If successful, he said, the savings could trickle down to the entire supply chain, resulting in fewer work stoppages due to lack of funding, and, in the most extreme scenarios, even prevent the closure of entire factories.  Lee said:  ""We think all the supply chain, not just supply chain finance, can be handled by blockchain, [which] will make the whole business transaction easier to validate and enhance the efficiency of the whole ecosystem.""  Tacking funding delays  Though Chained Finance is sponsored by Foxconn as its first ""core supplier"" and Dianrong as the first P2P lender, Lee expects the independent company will onboard clients in China and around the world.  He described the early implementation of Chained Finance – revealed at the LendIt conference – as part of an educational process designed to help teach small business suppliers about the technology.  For example, in the traditional supply chain lending space, a so-called 'first level' supplier will contact a lender such as Dianrong to ask for a loan, frequently just to pay a second- or third-level supplier.  With suppliers going as deep as 13 layers in some of the more advanced global supply chains, these loan funds can take days or weeks to reach the actual manufacturer in need.  In the meantime, the waiting recipient may not be able to pay its employees and be forced to close, according to Dianrong co-founder Soul Htite, who helped develop Chained Finance.  For this reason, Htite explained in the LendIt press event, he thinks of the blockchain solution as more than just a way to better handle loans.  He said:  ""Many of them have tried to explain to me they are victims of this inefficiency and every year some of them shut down, and they will start again. So what we're really trying to do here is not a loan, but a full cash-flow solution.""  Connecting the chain  Stepping back, it's important to note that Hon Hai Precision Industry Company (the Taiwan-based firm that trades as Foxconn) is one of the largest employers in the world, with some tallies putting its headcount in excess of 1 million people.  But with an estimated 30,000 suppliers providing parts for products manufactured for Apple, Samsung and others, the company still has a long way to go before Chain Finance's early loans represent a significant percentage of its parent company's revenue.  As part of that growth, Htite said the company is currently looking to onboard 'core' suppliers — like Foxconn – for free.  The plan is that, prior to taking over a blockchain node or being given credentialed access to the platform, a core supplier would hand over its data to Chained Finance, which would then onboard its suppliers, and so on.  Instead of charging these suppliers to join, Chained Finance, will charge P2P lenders a fee for gaining access to the new system.  ""We connect the first one, with the second one, with the third one, with the fourth one,"" said Htite, adding:  ""We enable them to access a bigger lending space in an addressable market than they did before.""  Building the platform  On stage at the conference, Lee and Htite explained that blockchain-based supply chain products will initially be aimed at the tech and auto industries.  Htite later expanded on the statement, adding that technology is the number-one priority, followed by the auto industry, with suppliers to the garments industry also being targeted.  What the three industries have in common, Htite said, is a relatively shallow pool of suppliers, which he contends is necessary to accommodate the blockchain platform’s early stage of development.  Conceding the limitations of the platform, Htite said that after the demo he was approached by a representative of the oil industry, which he said has as many as 13 supplier layers.  ""As interesting as it is,"" he said. ""I don’t think we have the capacity to change the whole world. We want to be realistic and just focus on these [three industries].""  When pressed about the technical specifications of the test, Dianrong CEO Kevin Guo explained that the number of nodes required was ""small"" and managed entirely by Chained Finance.  Further, Htite mentioned support for bitcoin, ethereum and Hyperledger, though he didn’t specify which of Hyperledger's several open-source codebases were used. He did, however, indicate that his company's decision to join the Hyperledger consortium was related to the supply chain financing product.  China, then the world  Currently, the Chained Finance team consists of 40 employees.  But as other firms like Denmark-based Maersk and Microsoft release their own supply chain solutions, that number is expected to grow to 200 people by the end of this year.  ""The majority of them will be developing material to explain the value and the need to onboard more and more suppliers,"" Htite said.  As the operation grows, it's not just the employee count that is expected to increase.  In addition to supply chain finance, Lee said he expects to expand into supply chain logistics and procurement, which would position the operation in even more direct competition with Maersk's project.  Current expansion efforts are being taken forward slowly, as the Foxconn spin-off tests the volume capacity of various blockchains that can interoperate with the Chained Finance platform.  Yet, in as little as two years, Lee said, the project could expand to India, with Africa following shortly thereafter.  Asked about rumors reported by Bloomberg that Foxconn might open a $7bn factory in the US, Lee wasn't able to respond, but he did say he expects to be able to offer US suppliers blockchain-based trade financing in as little as five years.  Should that happen, the movement of so much international lending activity to a trusted blockchain could eventually even increase trust between US banks and banks in China, he said.  And if Foxconn actually opens a plant of that size in the US, Lee said it would strengthen Chained Finance's position.  He concluded:  ""If Foxconn has more factories in the US ... this same concept can still apply, or even more easily apply.""

42399661,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbyNkk,1489404620,Bitcoin's Price is Already Back Above Pre-ETF Rejection Levels,"Despite the SEC's rejection of a high-profile bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application last week, the price of bitcoin is already trading at levels observed before the decision.  After dropping nearly $300 within minutes of the news on Friday, bitcoin has edged up steadily over the weekend, rising to a high of $1,242 today.  That figure is notably already $40 higher than the price observed at the start of trading on Friday, when bitcoin traded at $1,202 per bitcoin, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  Given the high expectations for the ETF, even avid bitcoin traders are expressing surprise at the digital currency's quick recovery.  Joseph Lee, founder of bitcoin derivatives platform Magnr, for example, argued that the development shows ""strong underlying demand"" for bitcoin.  ""Even a regulatory announcement from a large geopolitical region now has little influence on a price set by a global market,"" he told CoinDesk.  The development goes so far as to buck the assertions of a range of bitcoin trading experts and entrepreneurs, many of whom had anticipated a return to volatility should the ETF have failed in its approval bid.  However, it may be too early to predict exactly where the bitcoin price will move from here.  As noted by traders, major China-based exchanges continue to operate without the ability for users to withdraw funds, which may be depressing overall activity and elevating prices.  Others suggested that, once resumed, bitcoin's price could trend higher, as traders seek to place positions ahead of what could be a prolonged rally.

42379286,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX85GcD,1489399961,Say Hello to the Multi-Blockchain Business Model,"Our latest State of Blockchain report, released this week, reveals that VC funding for blockchain startups rose sharply in Q4 year-over-year, even while the annual total was virtually unchanged.  What the slides don’t show is a shift in the nature of the investments that becomes even more apparent if we zoom out and include other recent financing rounds.  Over the past six months, there have been over 25 investments in blockchain startups. Five have been for amounts greater than $10m.  Here's the interesting part: all but one of the recent large investments have been in startups with a multi-blockchain business model, whereas a year ago, none of them were.  The players  The latest investment, announced this week, is a $24m funding round for payments platform Align Commerce. The company has indicated that the funds will be used for a rebranding (it will now be called Veem) and an expansion of operations.  While the three-year-old startup has so far focused on the bitcoin blockchain, in conversation with CoinDesk, the CEO confirmed that not only can it also use Swift messaging rails, but that the firm is actively exploring additional blockchains.  If the plan goes ahead, Veem will pass from a 'pure play' to a 'multichain' service.  Before that came Bitfury, which raised $30m in January. The firm started out five years ago as a bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer, moved into blockchain services, and most recently announced a land-titling joint project for which it is using both a private blockchain and bitcoin.  You can’t get much more multichain than Polychain, which raised $10m late last year. The hedge fund plans to invest in blockchain tokens, with no prejudice as to the protocol.  And, in October, a 10-year-old payments startup called PayCommerce raised $22m specifically to explore blockchain, meaning its business model is now a mix of centralized and decentralized systems.  The only exception to the list is Axoni, a pure private blockchain service for capital markets which raised $18m in December.  The context  Looking at the comparable data, the same period a year ago (October 2015–March 2016) saw a similar number of VC investments, four of which were greater than $10m.  All of them were ‘pure plays’: Bitt (a bitcoin exchange in Barbados), Blockstream (a development firm focusing on the bitcoin blockchain), Digital Asset Holdings (pure private blockchain) and Align Commerce again (back when it was pure bitcoin).  While not conclusive, this trend does point to a blurring of the boundaries between the different technologies. More businesses and investors seem to realize that, in such a young field, it pays to have options.  For bitcoin companies, this could mean accepting that the structural problems may end up being unsurmountable, and that the technological leaps in the blockchain space offer intriguing alternatives. For fintech companies like PayCommerce, it could mean understanding that the potential is real.  The shift  Business models aside, there’s another interesting trend going on, which shows what could be the beginning of a significant geographical shift.  Take a look at the investors in the rounds greater than $10m over the past six months.  One of the investors in Veem was SBI Holdings, a Japanese investment arm. The sole investor in the BitFury round was Credit China Fintech Holdings. Asian investors were present in only one (Blockstream) of the large rounds in the same period a year ago.  While the sample size is admittedly not large, the funding rounds over the coming months are likely to confirm this trend: an emphasis on business models that blend blockchains, and greater geographical diversification – all signs of a growing and maturing sector.
