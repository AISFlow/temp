42412974,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl75am,1675723998,Bitcoin Holds Steady Near $23K as Investors Weigh Their Next Steps,"Bitcoin dipped for a fifth consecutive day Monday before regaining ground later in the day to trade near $23,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently down about a half a percentage point over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinDesk.  “Bitcoin has had a few rough sessions but broadly speaking it still looks in good shape, sitting within the range it's traded in over the last couple of weeks and not far from the new year highs,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at forex services firm Oanda, wrote in a Monday note.  Bitcoin (BTC) has risen about 40% in price this year amid surging investor confidence that inflation is waning without throwing the U.S. economy into recession. An unexpectedly strong employment report on Friday raised fresh concerns on both counts and sent crypto assets below $23,000 over the weekend after it breached $24,000 on a couple of occasions last week.  Meanwhile, ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto in market value, edged higher by 1.3% to recently trade at $1,640. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures overall crypto market performance, was up 1% for the day.  Traditional markets kicked off a new week lower as investors mulled the U.S. Federal Reserve’s response to the jobs data.  The S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.6% and 1%, respectively, during the afternoon trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was down 0.1%. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter point last week after eight months of more hawkish half- and three-quarter-point hikes.  “Job numbers gave credence or credibility to the fact that the Fed couldn't leave rates higher for longer and the markets have slowly started to respond to that,” Ben McMillan, chief investment officer of crypto asset manager IDX Digital Assets, told CoinDesk in an interview.  BTC's current $20,000 threshold is a firm technical support, according to McMillan, although he said he wouldn’t be surprised to see BTC retest this critical mark.  “Crypto volatility is gonna persist this year, even if the uptrend is structurally bullish,” he said. “I think the key thing for investors now to keep an eye on is understanding bitcoin volatility and how to price it and size it in their portfolios.”  Investors are now scrutinizing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s annual sit-down with David Rubenstein at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, which could “shake things up a bit and is something the market is not pricing fully,” according to Singapore-based crypto options trading firm QCP Capital.  QCP Capital wrote on Telegram Monday that equities’ performance on Monday and after Powell’s speech on Tuesday will “guide our next leg in crypto.”  “If he [Powell] again defers to next week’s [consumer price index data], then we could be in for a nervous wait,” the firm added.  Elsewhere in markets  LDO, the governance token of the Lido decentralized autonomous organization, climbed 14% to $2.28 after dropping below the $2 range earlier in the day. Data sourced from Coinglass showed that the funding rates for the token were positive, a signal that market sentiment is bullish among traders.  Despite declining roughly 5.5% from Sunday, same time, layer 1 blockchain Fantom’s native FTM token has risen about 15% during the past week.

42412967,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl75UE,1675723337,Hermès vs. MetaBirkins: The NFT Case That Could Have Major Trademark and Artistic Consequences,"NEW YORK — The limits of art and trademark law were tested this past week as the trial between 28-year-old non-fungible token (NFT) artist Mason Rothschild and Hermès comes to a close.  Tensions have been brewing between the two entities since December 2021, when Rothschild released his collection of 100 furry digital handbags titled MetaBirkins – a name that serves as a nod to Hermès' signature Birkin handbag – at Art Basel in Miami. The project was an extension of a one-of-one NFT artwork called ""Baby Birkin,"" which originally sold at auction in May 2021 for 5.5 ETH, or about $23,500 at the time.  Upon release, Rothschild said his new series was ""inspired by the acceleration of fashion’s 'fur-free' initiatives and embrace of alternative textiles."" The NFTs in the collection had a starting price of 0.1 ETH, or about $450 at the time of its release.  Hermès was not pleased with the project and sent out a cease and desist letter to Rothschild on December 16, 2021. According to Reuters, the collection made over $1 million in sales by January 2022 before OpenSea, and soon other marketplaces, delisted it from their sites.  Hermès International filed a trademark lawsuit against him on Jan. 14, 2022, claiming that Rothschild was ""stealing the goodwill in Hermès' famous intellectual property to create and sell his own line of products,"" which could create confusion among its consumer base.  According to a message posted by Rothschild to Twitter, he called the claims made by Hermès ""baseless"" and said he hoped to set a precedent in the art and NFT spaces.  ""I am not creating or selling fake Birkin bags. I've made artworks that depict imaginary, fur-covered Birkin bags,"" he wrote. ""The fact that I sell the art using NFTs doesn't change the fact that it's art.""  Rothschild sought to bolster his case by referencing a letter sent by the product marketing manager for the Campbell Soup Company to artist Andy Warhol in 1964, which praised his iconic pop-art work featuring a can of Campbell's tomato soup, among others, and wished him success.  In March 2021, Rothschild argued that his work was a commentary on the ""animal cruelty inherent in Hermès’ manufacture of its ultra-expensive leather handbags,"" and was protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. ""These images, and the NFTs that authenticate them, are not handbags; they carry nothing but meaning,"" his lawyers wrote in the filing.  Rothschild filed to dismiss the case in May 2022, though a federal judge in New York denied the motion in a one-page order. Similiarly, Hermès pushed for a summary judgment in October 2022, which the judge also denied.  The suit officially moved to trial at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Jan. 30, 2023.  Inside the court room  After six days, the courtroom assembled Monday for closing arguments from the Hermès and Rothschild's lawyers ahead of the jury's deliberations.  Oren Warshavsky, a lawyer representing Hermès, outlined the findings gathered from the week's testimonies. He explained that Hermès was ""trying two different cases,"" which included confusion for consumers as to who issued the NFTs as well as damage to the Birkin brand through dilution.  “Rothschild’s MetaBirkin NFTs and Birkin Bags aren’t sold side by side,"" said Warshavsky, explaining the similarities between physical Birkins and MetaBirkin NFTs that might mislead NFT collectors. ""If you saw [both of them] would you know the difference?”  ""The NFT market is immature and highly speculative, and most people don’t know how it works,"" he added.  Rothschild's defense brought in Dr. David Neal, managing partner and founder of Catalyst Behavioral Sciences, to analyze a pre-trial survey conducted by the president of MMR strategy group, Dr. Bruce Isaacson, to test for the likelihood of confusion as to whether Hermès' Birkin bags and MetaBirkin NFTs were related.  While Isaacson found that the percentage for likelihood confusion among the surveyed population was 18.7%, Neal recoded the data and found a 9.3% figure, suggesting that more people were aware of the distinction between Birkin Bags and MetaBirkin NFTs than previously reported.  Warshavsky additionally highlighted that dilution to the Hermès brand stems from using the Birkin name in the NFT collection itself. He claimed that the more people who use a given trademarked name, the fewer people associate it with the original brand. Using the international coffee chain Starbucks as an example, he noted that if an entrepreneur chose to make a sportswear company called Starbucks, over time the name Starbucks would hold less value as a café brand.  Other testimony in the case pointed to the fact that Rothschild's use of the trademarked Birkin name helped him acquire value for his collection. Warshavsky referenced Harvard Business School professor and investment firm a16z researcher Scott Kominers' Friday testimony, when he said the MetaBirkin NFT collection raked in major profits before it minted due to its use of the Birkin name.  “MetaBirkins sold at the amount they did because of the Birkin name,"" said Warshavsky. ""People spent that money because of the name MetaBirkin, regardless of which NFT they were getting.”  The jury is expected to reach a verdict by this week.  What's at stake?  The trial has garnered attention from spectators across the crypto, art and law spaces because the case ties together questions regarding trademarks, NFTs and First Amendment rights.  ""This case is one of the first and arguably the most prominent lawsuits to ever focus on trademarks and NFTs and whether trademark rights extend to the digital sphere,"" Gai Sher, senior counsel at Greenspoon Marder LLP, told CoinDesk. ""This case could very well set a legal precedent not only for trademarks in the context of NFTs, but for all digital assets as they relate to fair use and free speech.""  Last week, Rothschild argued that his NFTs were ""part of an experiment"" to showcase what defines value in the luxury space. ""Is it the image or the actual product?"" he told the nine-person jury.  ""One of the most important questions in this case thus far has been how the court will analyze trademark infringement claims in connection with NFTs – will the court analyze the case in the context of consumer confusion, the way Hermes sought for, or is this a case about artistic expression?"" Sher said.  Sher says a pivotal point in the case came in May 2022, when the district court said it would analyze the case with the Rogers v. Grimaldi standard – a pivotal 1988 trademark lawsuit between actress Ginger Rogers and film producer Alberto Grimaldi – that examines the balance between artistic expression and trademark infringement.  ""The Rogers Test states that an artist can use a trademark in connection with an expressive work if the trademark is artistically relevant to the product and doesn’t explicitly mislead consumers as to the sponsorship, endorsement or other connection to the brand,"" she said. ""Hermes argues that although Rothchild’s NFT bags don’t have real-world utility, many luxury brands are entering the digital space and creating digital assets of their own which creates consumer confusion.""  She added that the case also looks at whether Rothschild's NFTs do not have any added utility and are not virtual wearables for metaverse spaces, which would be considered ""non-speech, commercial and arguably functional products that just now happen to be in virtual form.""  ""The increasing innovation around virtual products in connection with metaverse technologies will require further analysis that the courts have not yet addressed,"" she added. ""It will be interesting to see how courts will analyze trademark infringement claims in the context of virtual functional NFTs and how this in turn will affect brands’ decisions to launch functional NFTs in the virtual space.""",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Rosie Perper, Cam Thompson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/02/06/hermes-vs-metabirkins-the-nft-case-that-could-have-major-trademark-and-artistic-consequences,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d266f9ec776d9d80984f8c5bd2319b579b21dc87-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412970,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl75VA,1675722600,UK to Start Further Development Work on ‘Likely Needed’ Digital Pound,"The Bank of England is starting further research and development work on a digital pound for purchasing goods and services – something that’s likely to be needed in the future, the regulator said Monday.  The central bank and the country’s finance ministry wants the public to weigh in on its plans for a digital version of the pound sterling, and will publish a consultation open to public comment on Tuesday.  ""While cash is here to stay, a digital pound issued and backed by the Bank of England could be a new way to pay that’s trusted, accessible and easy to use,” Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt said in a statement to the press. Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has previously said the U.K. may need a digital pound as a more secure alternative to private cryptocurrencies.  The U.K. is also busy setting up new regulatory frameworks that sets it apart in the region following its infamous exit from the European Union. Last week, the Treasury published its plans to regulate the country’s crypto sector, which – as industry members pointed out – deviated slightly from the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) initiative.  The digital pound consultation is the U.K.’s answer to the European Central Bank’s (ECB) two-year investigation into a retail digital euro, which is expected to wrap this year and make way for a decision on issuing one.  As the Bank of England envisions it, a digital pound it issues would be accessible through digital wallets offered by the private sector via smartphones or smart cards. The central bank digital currency is intended for on- and offline payments with no interest paid on holdings, according to the announcement.  The Bank of England plans to run its own experimentation and design phase in the next two years, according to people familiar with the matter – which will be followed by a decision on whether or not to build a digital pound. A pilot test on its central bank digital currency won’t kick off until at least 2025.  Read more: UK Crypto Rules Set a Modest Post-Brexit Divergence From the European Union  The digital pound so far doesn’t sound too different from a potential digital euro, according to what’s laid out in the announcement. Neither would be fully anonymous but promises to preserve some level of privacy and be subject to data protection standards. There would be a limit on individual holdings and no interest paid on holdings, the release said. The ECB is also contemplating caps on issuance and individual holdings.  Regulated firms will be able to use the digital pound infrastructure to “design innovative, user-friendly services and handle all customer-facing interactions,” the press release said.  The decision on issuing a digital pound “will largely be based on future developments in money and payments,” the press statement said. The public's responses to the consultation, could also influence the decision.  The consultation, set to be published on Tuesday, will lay out the central bank’s plans in detail.

Cleary Gottlieb attorney Sean O'Neal, representing Genesis, explained the proposed settlement during the status hearing for the crypto lender, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month. Earlier Monday, CoinDesk had reported that DCG and Genesis reached an agreement with a key group of creditors. CoinDesk, like Genesis, is owned by DCG.  The agreement in principle was reached with two groups of ad hoc creditors, DCG and Gemini Trust Co.  Read more: Bankrupt Lender Genesis and Parent DCG Reach Initial Agreement With Main Creditors: Source  ""Under the settlement, DCG would contribute that entity, [Genesis Global Trading], to [Genesis Global Holdco] ... that will happen on the effective date,"" O'Neal said.

Other aspects of the proposed deal will see a restructuring of the debt that DCG owes Genesis Holdco, one of the legal entities that filed for Chapter 11 protection. Under the new terms, DCG will issue a second lien term loan facility that will mature in June 2024.  ""There will be two tranches ... one will be denominated in U.S. dollars and pay 11.5% interest and tranche two will be denominated in bitcoin, [which will] pay a 5% interest,"" O'Neal said.  DCG has also agreed to issue a class of convertible preferred stock, O'Neal said, though the finer details of this issuance are still being worked out.  A press release published after the hearing ended said DCG would exchange its existing $1.1 billion promissory note – currently due in 2032 – for this convertible stock.  Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss tweeted about the proposed settlement during the hearing, saying Gemini will itself contribute ""up to $100 million more for Earn users as part of the plan.""  Gemini partnered with Genesis to offer the Earn yield product until Nov. 16, when Genesis announced its lending business would be halting withdrawals, which then affected Gemini Earn customers' ability to access their funds.

42411228,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKCx,1675718519,How Bitcoin NFTs Might Accidentally Fix Bitcoin's Security Budget,"Casey Rodarmor tweeted that “Inscriptions are finally ready for Bitcoin mainnet” on Jan. 20, and the use of inscriptions the last two weeks sparked a big hullabaloo on Twitter between some of Bitcoin’s partisan factions.  The hullabaloo included a number of different claims:  That Bitcoin’s security budget problem was accidently solved. So we wouldn’t have to worry that there would be no financial incentive to mine bitcoin in the future once the fixed supply runs out. Maybe transaction fees will be enough to incentivize miners?  Inscriptions would lead to blockchain spam and graffiti so uncontrollable that we are eventually engulfed by gray goo.  All these non-fungible tokens (NFT) and such on Bitcoin is just another silly fad, like colored coins.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Rodarmor’s flint rock tweet referred to the Ordinal protocol, which introduced inscriptions to Bitcoin. The Ordinal protocol assigns each satoshi, or sat (the smallest unit of bitcoin), a sequential number. It’s a little bit more complicated than that, but only a little. Once these sats are numbered and identified, users can inscribe the sat with arbitrary data, as long as the transaction doesn’t exceed the 4-megabyte (MB) block size limit. That arbitrary data can be anything!  A fully playable version of the first-person shooter DOOM? Sure.  A picture of a Bored Ape cross-pollinated with a CryptoPunk? Fine.  A bald, sunglasses-donning Taproot Wizard re-creation of the famous MSPaint-spawned Magic Internet Money Wizard that once served as an advertisement for the /r/Bitcoin subreddit that takes up almost the entirety of a Bitcoin block? Sure. Fine. But why?  Why not?  If you’re thinking: “That sounds a lot like NFTs” you’re right. They do sound a lot like NFTs. Ordinal NFTs is a good term – and it’s the term I’ll stick with – but out of respect for the sensitivities of hardline bitcoiners and in the interest of being as technically correct as possible, these are probably better characterized as “artifacts.” To be sure, external links to arbitrary data have been shared in the data field of Bitcoin transactions many times. Inscriptions take it a step further so that the linked data actually exists on the blockchain.  Bitcoin NFTs: Initial reactions and potential consequences  For those lucky enough to be unfamiliar with the politics of Crypto Twitter, you should know this has stirred up a fiery controversy. There are many Bitcoin influencer types who have staked a meaningful part of their reputations on hating NFTs – as they’re a distraction and technologically unsound – so Ordinal NFTs haven’t been a hit with them. To their credit, no matter how much crypto pluralists have bashed Bitcoin for being a pet rock project that only does peer-to-peer, borderless, censorship-resistant transactions in a decentralized manner, being very good at that is, in fact, very good.  Expanding too far afield from that use case, which Ordinal NFTs certainly should be characterized as, could be detrimental to that use case. But that argument’s central point is more philosophical than practical.  Practically, the strictest interpretation of the Bitcoin ethos would be that it doesn’t matter what someone does with their bitcoin so long as it abides by the rules of Bitcoin's software. If I want to waste my bitcoin on coffee then some other user is free to waste it on an Ordinal NFT. The conversation should end almost immediately thereafter.  That said, there are at least two small areas of potential concern: 1) illegal data and 2) chain bloat.  On the first, inscriptions could allow illegal data to become a part of the Bitcoin blockchain – like the links to illegal pornography that already exist on the blockchain, but in a more permanent way. This is an obviously terrible potential consequence of Ordinal NFTs, but there is some comfort in that there’s a technical requirement requiring a special off-chain agreement with a miner to inscribe data in excess of 1 MB. Furthermore, the Bitcoin blockchain is transparent, so the inclusion of this type of media would be met with swift investigation and punishment.  On the second, inscriptions have led to almost completely full 4-MB Bitcoin blocks. This is abnormal. Most Bitcoin blocks have not been close to the size limit. Some worry that the influx of large blocks will make it more difficult for new node participants to start up due to the immense amount of data that will accumulate over time and bloat the chain with superfluous data. This was the central battle in 2017 during the Blocksize Wars that led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash (which has higher blocksize limits than Bitcoin) and consequently Segregated Witness (SegWit) on Bitcoin, which, in combination with 2021’s Taproot upgrade, made inscriptions possible.  Along with separating signatures from transactions – in a witness data field that can include other arbitrary data if desired – SegWit introduced the block weight, which allows more transactions to be included in the 4-MB block by theoretically discounting the size of witness data. And Taproot made it easier to include even more data in the witness.  Everything is delicately tied together – and this is one of the reasons I think the risk of chain bloat is overblown. Since inscription data is witness data, it can be pruned, in that it’s technically possible to run Bitcoin software without downloading all the historical witness data. In non-technical speak, this is good because users are putting a bigger proportion of new data into a Bitcoin transaction in a spot where it slows everyone down as little as possible.  The other is that hardware gets better and cheaper over time, so even though Bitcoin’s blockchain will continue to grow in size as long as it is used, the nodes will simply capture more processing power. Such is life as a transparent, decentralized ledger.  But where the discussion of Ordinal NFT’s consequences becomes far more interesting is how these now mostly full blocks might affect Bitcoin’s transaction fee market for blockspace.  Bitcoin has full blocks now? Did we fix the security budget?  Bitcoin miners make money by validating transactions in exchange for transaction fees and a block subsidy, which is the new bitcoin mined after each block is mined. Transaction fee rates are quoted in sat/vB, which means that the more data a transaction includes the larger the fee. There is interesting game theory at play as users are the ones who propose the fee rate to miners and blockspace is scarce due to the 4-MB size limit.  Some users opt to only propose transactions at 1 sat/vB, the lowest fee rate. For those users, it could take a while for their transactions to complete if there are lots of other users trying to do transactions. And they could theoretically never be completed since miners tend to validate transactions with higher fee rates.  With this mechanism in mind, and the fact that Bitcoin blocks weren’t really ever full until inscriptions came along, it’s probably unsurprising to read that making an Ordinal NFT is usually more expensive than a regular Bitcoin transaction. Pictures take up a lot of space especially compared to plain text.  Here’s how it could be good for Bitcoin and its security budget.  More transactions should mean more fees. Blocks full of transactions are better than blocks not full of transactions – not to mention the empty blocks (which does happen). It almost goes without saying, but a more robust transaction fee market is good for the Bitcoin network. It’s good for any financial network. Right now, miners make almost all of their money from the block subsidy, but the subsidy will go away eventually leaving only transaction fees. So for Bitcoin to survive in the long term, a robust transaction fee market needs to take hold.  To that, a potential best-case scenario for the longevity of Ordinal NFTs is that they act as a buyer of last resort for blockspace. Since Ordinal NFTs are unusually large transactions, they will almost always be more expensive than normal peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions on a per-transaction basis even if they have low fee rates. As such, there’s a chance a user who wants an Ordinal NFT might be willing to wait longer to save money by paying a lower fee rate. Then these transactions will only be included in blocks when market fee rates are comparatively low and block space is abundant.  Where that may fall apart is the potential that users don’t actually start paying a higher fee rate for peer-to-peer bitcoin financial transactions than Ordinal NFT transactions. Maybe then almost all blocks will only include Ordinal NFTs and no other types of transactions forever. I think that’s unlikely but it could happen.  As for what that means for the direction of transaction fees, Luxor’s head of content, Colin Harper (a former CoinDesker), put it well in a recent article:  There’s a good chance that ordinal NFTs alone do not increase transaction fees. Well, they could increase fees, but not in the way you might think. After all, they benefit from the SegWit data discount, so theoretically a block full of digital artifacts would actually carry fewer fees than one filled entirely with ordinary Bitcoin transactions.  I think this is spot-on and it’s how I am thinking about this until we have more empirical evidence to consider.  Sure Ordinal NFTs are fun-ish, but at the risk of sounding pompous they are so much less consequential than bitcoin’s best use case of peer-to-peer, borderless, censorship-resistant money. In all, my take is that Ordinal NFTs will be at its very best a means to strengthen the Bitcoin transaction fee market and at worst a spectacular fad that fades away with no wider negative consequences for Bitcoin.  It will at the very least be interesting to see where this takes us.

The report underscores investors’ surging confidence in crypto markets that has sent the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization up nearly 40% in January, and some altcoins by even higher.  The COT report, released weekly by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), provides a breakdown of holdings and open interest for traders of futures contracts, and is a measure of market sentiment. It shows the number of long, short and spread contracts in the Dealer/Intermediary, Asset Manager/Institutional, Leveraged Funds, Other Reportables and Non Reportable Positions categories.  The Asset Manager/Institutional category is comprised of larger institutional investors, i.e., pension funds, endowments, hedge funds and insurance companies.  The most recent bitcoin COT report shows that of the 7,734 open futures positions for asset managers, 7,671 are long positions with just 63 being short. Asset managers added 644 long positions as of Jan. 24 – the third consecutive week that they’ve built upon an already substantial long position.  As a distinct unit, asset managers with reportable futures positions are now 99.19% long, while making up 44.1% of long open interest among all reporting groups. This report is specific to asset managers with reportable futures positions to the CFTC. It does not include asset managers who have no exposure to cryptocurrencies.  The 7,671 open long positions represent an all-time high in the aggregate. The 99.1% long concentration for asset managers is an all-time high as well.  This trend reflects continued optimism for an asset that has already rewarded investors handsomely. Yet, a number of analysts recently have suggested the crypto market is due for a retreat amid conflicting macroeconomic signals, most notably the stubbornly resilient job market.  The COT findings could also suggest that asset managers have reached an extreme that is likely to reverse.

Powell may need to take a more hawkish approach in future, he said.  “It's still going to be very hard to get to 2% [inflation],” Moya said, adding the inflation situation has placed traders in a tough spot.  “There are a lot of traders that were thinking that they might be done,” Moya said, referring to expectations of what the Fed would do about rate hikes after last week's jobs report. “Now all of a sudden you're looking at the market and now it's leaning towards maybe two more 25 basis point [interest] rate increases.”  “These expectations are widely swinging,” Moya said. He said traders aren’t necessarily being influenced by layoffs in the tech and finance sectors but by the labor market’s projected growth.  Until that weakens, he said, “you’re going to continue to see continued wage pressure, which is going to make the Fed stare at [the] labor market and inflation report and say, ‘Well, maybe we need to continue with this hawkish pushback,’” Moya said.  He said investors should price in at least one to two more interest rate hikes.  “We're probably rangebound for a little bit until we have much clearer clarity, which won't happen for probably a few months,” Moya said, referring to the crypto and equities markets.

The capital from the ParaFi Capital-led round will go toward hiring and new product development.  ""Last year has thrown into the limelight the tremendous importance of comprehension, auditability and transparency of blockchains,"" said Elementus CEO Max Galka in the press release.

42394489,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8LPF,1675711779,What Is an Open Edition NFT Sale?,"Many successful non-fungible token (NFT) creators have experimented with different methods to boost the value of their projects. Early profile picture (PFP) collections like CryptoPunks or Bored Ape Yacht Club imbued rarity traits into their collections to make some NFTs harder to come by than others, while many recent collections have started adding in utility so that NFTs in a collection can continue to provide value to holders over time.  In recent months, the NFT market has taken a tumble amid an extended crypto winter, with trade volumes dipping and new entrants into the space tapering off. In response, many new NFT projects have had to shift strategies to boost the reach of their artwork.  One such method that has garnered new attention is the open edition, where an NFT project will allow any number of artwork editions to be minted. This serves in contrast to projects that cap their collections at a certain number of NFTs, for example 10,000 editions.  Open editions vs. limited editions  Limited editions are the most common way NFT collections are released and set the total number of NFTs that will exist at a specific, set number. For example, many famous profile picture NFTs (PFP) including Bored Ape Yacht Club, Doodles and Azuki released collections of exactly 10,000 NFTs. Limited edition collections are usually priced at a higher price point and place emphasis on selling out. There are also one-of-one NFTs, in which there is only one unique NFT that can be minted.  Open editions, on the other hand, do not set a cap on how many NFTs can be created. Typically, NFT collectors are usually given a set time frame to mint an NFT from an open edition collection. When the time limit runs out, the number of NFTs in the collection is capped. So, for example, if a collection is selling its NFTs for 24 hours and only three NFTs are minted, that collection is now capped at three editions. Creators can also cap the number of mints allowed per crypto wallet to keep the collection size low and boost scarcity.  Open editions have also been employed as a charitable fundraising tool, which may set a target goal for the funds as when the collection will be capped.  Broadly speaking, the goal of open edition collections is to make the artwork as accessible to the masses as possible, generally at a lower price.  Pros  Open editions can be very useful for making the project more accessible to a broader range of collectors. Well-known digital artists, such as XCOPY and Grant Riven Yun, have seen success with releasing their collections as open editions.  Some NFT creation platforms, including Manifold and Zora, have popularized open editions and made the tools for creating an open edition more accessible to new entrants in the NFT space. In addition, open editions only require the artist to create one artwork, reducing the amount of coding and work needed to produce an entire NFT collection.  Cons  In practice, open editions usually best serve artists who already have an existing fanbase and who want to welcome a new audience that may have been priced out of their earlier collections.  In addition, if a large number of NFTs are minted during an open edition sale, the collection may be deemed less valuable in the long term.  Some collectors also worry that having a large number of art from their favorite collectors available to the masses may dilute the value of the artist's other works.  Artists' reactions  Artists from across the NFT space have weighed in on open editions, viewing them generally favorably.  ""I think one thing that people underestimate about the lower-cost open edition, or just more accessible ways to get your art out there, is that it builds a distribution channel like nothing you've ever experienced before,"" said Jack Butcher, creator of the popular Checks VV NFT project, which minted as an open edition early last month.  ""It maybe feels more in line with the ethos of Web3 that has maybe been in conflict with a lot of that behavior in the space for so long,"" he told CoinDesk.  NFT artist FVCKRENDER wrote on Twitter that open edition mints prevent ""gatekeeping"" of an artist's work.  Artist Grant Riven Yun recently tweeted that lower-priced collections are beneficial to both the artist and collectors.  Betty, one of the creators behind the NFT project Deadfellaz, said open editions shift the focus from trading art based on its floor price and overall perceived value to actually owning art.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | TRADING,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-an-open-edition-nft-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54b844ebc1b720e42844f3f6f110e85eecbcfef7-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412971,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl75Xy,1675711641,FTX Money Backed US Lawmakers With Future of Crypto in Their Hands,"Many members of Congress with the biggest influence over coming U.S. cryptocurrency legislation received direct contributions from top executives of FTX, leaving them in a complicated political relationship with the crypto industry.  More than one in three of the lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee, House Financial Services Committee and the Senate and House agriculture panels took campaign money from former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other senior executives of the disgraced crypto exchange. Those on the agriculture committees – which have oversight of derivative trading – were particular funding targets of FTX management.  As the House Agriculture Committee begins considering how the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should oversee digital assets, two of its most important members are contending with receiving FTX money. The campaign of Chairman Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) took donations from Bankman-Fried and Ryan Salame, who was co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets. The new chairman of the subcommittee focusing on crypto, Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), accepted a contribution from Salame.  “The FTX debacle proves we must have more robust regulation over the crypto industry,” Johnson said in a statement. “No degree of political involvement by FTX executives can obscure that plain fact.”  The lawmakers who received FTX money in the four key committees – 38% of the members, according to Federal Election Commission records – have been under pressure to say something about what they'll do about the contributions now. One in 10 told CoinDesk they donated the money to charity.  However, that decision may have backfired because FTX’s bankruptcy team is working to claw back those donations, directly asking the candidates to return the funds or face legal action.  Nearly two-thirds of the members of the Senate Agriculture committee took FTX cash, including Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the panel’s chairwoman, and its ranking Republican, Sen. John Boozeman (R-Ark.). Last year that panel was in the crypto industry’s spotlight because the two lawmakers pushed a bill to establish rules of the road for digital assets in the U.S., including giving the CFTC authority over trading of non-security tokens such as bitcoin.  They’re expected to give it another go in this congressional session, but the previous legislation – the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act – was championed by Bankman-Fried, so the specter of the fallen CEO could loom large.  Oversight of stablecoins is seen as a regulatory need that could be solved with a relatively narrow bill. The House Financial Services Committee’s top members worked on one in 2022, and new Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) has indicated crypto remains a priority.  The Senate Banking Committee is also focused on digital assets, and has scheduled a Feb. 14 hearing examining the “crypto crash.”  Seven of the 23 members of the Senate Banking Committee accepted money from FTX executives, including Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the panel’s ranking Republican. If crypto legislation happens this year, there will likely have to be a meeting of the minds between Scott and the committee’s crypto-skeptic chairman, Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/06/ftx-money-backed-us-lawmakers-with-future-of-crypto-in-their-hands,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6200543fce060bfec93526e49963ef26aa6007f6-6122x4082.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412962,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl75QU,1675709229,"Independent FTX Examiner Could Cost Crypto Exchange $100M, Court Told","Bankruptcy court Judge John Dorsey declined to rule definitively on whether to appoint an independent examiner into the FTX bankruptcy case. The U.S. government argued that statute called for the judge to demand such an examination while FTX said a probe would represent a costly duplication.  After expressing concerns the examiner’s work could be expensive and delay approval of a Chapter 11 reorganization plan, Dorsey said he hoped the issue could be resolved between the two sides ahead of a further hearing on Wednesday.  “How could I confirm a plan if I've appointed an examiner to let me know whether there was insiders who did something wrong?” Dorsey asked. “It really doesn't make any sense to be a mandatory obligation by the court that is not subject to discretion.”  Juliet Sarkessian, representing the U.S. Trustee, a branch of the Department of Justice (DOJ) concerned with bankruptcy matters, had argued the decision was effectively out of the judge’s hands in such a major case.  “This is what Congress decided needed to be done in these circumstances,” Sarkessian said, citing the relevant section of the Bankruptcy Code. “FTX’s situation is a dumpster fire.”  “There's no reason to believe that the cost of the examiner during an investigation is going to be more than the debtors’ professionals conducting an investigation,” Sarkessain added, referring to FTX lawyers’ fees that can top $2,000 per hour.  An examiner could look at alleged misuse of customer funds and security of digital assets at the exchange, and whether any of those responsible were still employed by FTX, Sarkessian said.  Lawyers for FTX and its creditors argued the report would be a waste of estate resources, and that alleged wrongdoers had already left the company.  “We do not have enough money to pay back all of our creditors and the U.S. Trustee … says that we should spend tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars” on a report, said James Bromley of FTX’s law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell. There is “no evidence that any of those professionals or this examiner to be appointed would be any more independent” than the company’s own staff and hired experts, Bromley added. FTX’s new chief executive, John J Ray III, had previously cited $90 million to $100 million as a typical cost for an examiner’s report, based on his experience working with companies such as Enron.  In January, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators wrote a letter to the judge to support having the independent examiner envisaged under the Bankruptcy Code to probe allegations of fraud or incompetence at the failed crypto exchange.  Last week, four months after being appointed by a New York court, examiner Shoba Pillay published her 500-page report on the collapse of crypto lending company Celsius Network, saying the company had misled customers and used customer funds for operational expenses.

42414530,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB98M2,1675706374,Decentralized Lending Protocol Clearpool to Start Institutional Borrowing Platform,"Clearpool, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, will launch its noncustodial institutional borrowing platform Clearpool Prime in the first quarter of this year, according to a Monday blog post outlining plans for 2023.  Institutional borrowers, after going through know-your-customer checks, will be able to create so-called permissioned borrowing pools on Clearpool Prime with their own set of loan terms such as size, duration and interest rate. They’ll also be able to invite lenders to the pool.  Clearpool is a blockchain-based credit marketplace that connects borrowers to lenders with hosting borrowing pools. Lenders, when they provide liquidity to a pool, receive so-called cpTokens that are specific to the pool in return. Those who hold the protocol’s governance token, CPOOL, can participate in voting and stake their tokens to earn rewards. So far, some $350 million of stablecoin loans have originated on Clearpool on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, per data on Clearpool’s loan dashboard.  Clearpool’s new platform comes as DeFi protocols aim to attract established institutional investors with more sophisticated products to ramp up lending after a disastrous past year. As the crypto market crashed and multiple crypto trading firms who were large borrowers blew up, centralized lenders such as CoinDesk sister company Genesis and Celsius Network encountered liquidity problems and several decentralized lending protocols left with defaults and bad debt.  Read more: Maple Finance Plots Comeback With New $100M Liquidity Pool for Tax Receivables With 10% Yield  “Prime addresses many of the problems that led to systemic risk in the CeFi [centralized finance] lending market in 2022, and we are confident that it will be a valuable addition to Clearpool and the institutional DeFi ecosystem,” the post said.  Clearpool also announced plans to expand the assets supported for borrowing in its permissionless borrowing pools to all ERC-20 and wrapped ERC-20 tokens such as wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) and wrapped ether (wETH). The first such pool will open in the coming months, according to the post.  The protocol will add permissionless term pools, where borrowers will be able to take out loans with fixed maturity periods. Lenders can lock up their cpTokens to earn additional yield. Clearpool will also issue designated tokens for the term pools called tpTokens that holders can trade on secondary markets.  The protocol unveiled a product called Exchange Traded Pools (ETP), “a first in DeFi,” per the blog post. These will allow lenders “to diversify liquidity across multiple borrower pools in a single transaction, mitigating counterparty risk while maintaining yield opportunities.""  CPOOL has gained 8% in the past 24 hours, outperforming BTC (-0.15%) and the CoinDesk Market Index (+0.16%).",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/06/decentralized-lending-protocol-clearpool-to-start-institutional-borrowing-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/372b4231ff34c7d7c9fc2d86ac53f844a87c7b45-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The agreement, which begins to resolve some of the major issues that sent Genesis into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, entails winding down the Genesis loan book as well as the sale of the bankrupt Genesis entities, the person said.  The term sheet also involves refinancing the outstanding loans where DCG borrowed $500 million in cash and about $100 million worth of bitcoin (BTC) from Genesis, the person said. Included is “an equitization of the infamous 10-year promissory note that DCG gave Genesis in return for failed hedge fund 3AC claims,” the person said, without providing details of the process. The promissory note was for $1.1 billion to Three Arrows Capital (3AC), a crypto hedge fund that collapsed last year.  The creditor group has been negotiating on behalf of companies and individuals with claims of around $2.4 billion against the crypto lender. The group is represented by law firms Proskauer and Kirkland as well as restructuring banker Houlihan Lokey.  The proposed deal will now be offered to other creditors, including hundreds of thousands of customers of the Gemini Earn lending product, the person said.  The lending arm of Genesis halted withdrawals on Nov. 16, 2022, in the wake of crypto exchange FTX’s collapse earlier that month. Last month, Genesis‘ lending businesses filed for bankruptcy protection in New York.  On Jan. 23, Genesis’ lawyers told Judge Sean H. Lane of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York at a hearing they foresaw reaching a deal with creditors by the end of that week.  Genesis declined to comment.

The complaint against Thomas Lehman was filed on Jan. 20, 2023, and focused on his role in coding and developing the “RRBAYC RSVP Contract,” and “rrbayc.com” site to sell the copycat NFTs. Terms of the settlement include barring Lehman from using ""any manner any BAYC Mark,"" destroying ""any materials in his possession or control publicly displaying the BAYC Marks"" and burning any RR/BAYC NFT he owns.  “I am happy to have resolved the Yuga Labs, Inc. v. Lehman trademark lawsuit in the [U.S. District Court] Northern District of New York,” Lehman said in a statement provided to CoinDesk. “It was never my intention to harm Yuga Labs’ brand, and I reject all disparaging statements made about Yuga Labs and its founders and appreciate their many positive contributions to the NFT space.”  A Yuga Labs spokesperson told CoinDesk that they “are pleased that Mr. Lehman acknowledged his role in assisting former cohorts, Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen, to infringe on Yuga Labs’ trademarks in developing, marketing and selling counterfeit NFTs.”  Yuga Labs is involved in an ongoing suit with Ryder Ripps over his project, which Yuga claims is a clear case of intellectual property (IP) infringement. In October 2022, Ripps filed an anti-SLAPP motion arguing his project is protected by free speech as a work of satire. The motion was denied in December 2022, but it was appealed by Ripps’ team, who also filed counterclaims against Yuga Labs.  The ongoing case has brought a focus to IP and trademark rights within the NFT space. Yuga Labs told CoinDesk it believes “that creators, especially those in the nascent Web3 space, must be able to rely on the law to protect their work against IP theft.”  See Also: Better Policy Can Turn NFTs Into an Intellectual Property Powerhouse",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION,Toby Leah Bochan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/02/06/yuga-labs-reaches-settlement-in-bored-ape-nft-trademark-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/444ce6883e256e035cba72895e7ec36c1b10c1cd-1600x900.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Revolut, which has around 25 million customers worldwide, the vast majority of whom are in the U.K. and the European Economic Area (EEA), is rolling out the service this week, AltFi reported Monday. At first, the London-based fintech will support staking of the tokens of Polkadot (DOT), Tezos (XTZ), Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH). Yields on the assets reach up to 11.65%, though these are variable, Revolut said in its email on Tuesday.  Crypto staking involves holders of a particular asset offering their tokens to help support the running and maintenance of a blockchain, receiving a reward in return. Staking has attained newfound prominence in the crypto industry in recent months since Ethereum, the largest blockchain supporting decentralized finance (DeFi), transitioned to a proof-of-stake model. Compared with a proof-of-work mechanism, proof-of-stake blockchains require far less energy and are cheaper to operate and more scalable.  Revolut has been offering crypto services since 2017, gradually stepping up its offerings over time. From solely providing buying and selling of crypto, the bank started allowing customers to transfer their assets to wallets and platforms elsewhere in 2021. In October 2022, Revolut added a feature allowing customers to spend their crypto on everyday purchases using a debit card. It received approval to offer crypto services from the Financial Conduct Authority in September.

Ray III, told a Delaware bankruptcy court on Monday.  The company had mysterious outflows worth hundreds of millions of dollars in early November, around the time the exchange filed for bankruptcy protection and founder Sam Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO.  Ray said he had hired technical experts in an attempt to shore up FTX’s insecure environment, and that Signia had prevented what could have been further hacking back in November.  “This case, you know, is about cybersecurity, or the failure of cybersecurity,” Ray said, outlining the various companies that are advising FTX as it seeks to wind up its affairs. “Sygnia is a highly technical cybersecurity firm.”  “Their services were critical, as we saw in the waking hours of the morning of the 11th [of November],” Ray said. “Hacking was occurring and this firm was not only instrumental in stopping that, but also rebuilding an environment that's highly sensitive to this day, because of the nature of crypto assets and the vulnerability of crypto assets.”  FTX “is probably a case study for how not to have a controlled environment for crypto,” said Ray, who has previously complained of weak governance by Bankman-Fried. He added the environment was “very vulnerable. We had hot wallets in a system where multiple people had access to passwords.”  “Literally, one of the founders could come into this environment, download half a billion dollars worth of wallets on a thumb drive, and walk off with them and there'll be no accounting for that whatsoever,” Ray said.

42414526,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB980o,1675699176,Global Crypto Industry Pledges Aid to Turkey Following Deadly Earthquakes,"Local and foreign crypto exchanges have pledged aid to Turkey after two powerful earthquakes and multiple aftershocks claimed thousands of lives on Monday.  The earthquakes have so far claimed at least 2,100 lives in Turkey and Syria, with organizations and countries around the world offering support as rescue efforts are underway. The international crypto community has shown an eagerness to send donations via digital assets, with multiple platforms pledging support.  Crypto exchanges including Binance, Gate.io and Bitfinex have said they are looking for ways to send support or have started prepping aid packages. Crypto exchange Bitget has already pledged 1 million Turkish Lira (around $53,000) to humanitarian aid, while Huobi Global has promised 2 million lira.  Crypto communities worldwide are generally quick to respond to humanitarian crises, with millions of dollars in donations pouring into Ukraine following the Russian invasion last year, and COVID-19 relief to India while it struggled with a deadly outbreak in 2021.  But crypto donations can be trickier than traditional payments or bank transfers when local authorities are less welcoming of digital assets that are in a regulatory gray area in jurisdictions across the world. Blockchain industry and research bodies in Turkey have put together a petition demanding authorities enable crypto-based donations to be accepted in Turkey.  The more than 40 entities that have signed the petition at publication time are requesting Turkish authorities to create ""official crypto asset wallets and share them through official channels"" – in the same way that Ukraine did shortly after the war started in February 2022 – to avoid ""malicious aid schemes.""  One Twitter user warned of untrustworthy fundraising efforts already popping up on messaging platforms like Telegram in Turkey.  It's unclear if the aid efforts extend to Syria, a war-torn nation subject to heavy economic sanctions from major economies including the U.S. and European Union.

42414525,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB97qC,1675699166,DeFi Lender Alchemix Approves ALCX Token Buyback Plan,"The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind crypto loans protocol Alchemix Finance on Monday approved a proposal to divert some of the cash bolstering its treasury and yield-farming activities into a token buyback program for its native ALCX.  Alchemix issues what it calls “self-repaying loans” to users that post crypto collateral in return for “alAssets” that are supposed to trade mostly in tandem with their underlying asset. The protocol has said protecting the peg is a top priority; it feels the pain when its synthetic assets falter, as they did during late 2022’s crypto market turmoil.  That has prompted Alchemix, which had its heyday in 2021, to scramble for short-term fixes that could help it woo more users in and increase deposits. The proposal by pseudonymous co-founder Scoopy Trooples seeks to address this by earmarking some of Alchemix’s long-term capital for other means.  The newly passed governance proposal aims to bolster alAssets by directing Alchemix to spend a third of its yield-farming revenue on buying ALCX tokens.It envisions using these tokens to increase Alchemix’s bribing power over decentralized finance (DeFi) yield markets.  “For every dollar that we spend in ALCX bribes for the Elixir AMO LP pools, it returns approximately 15% more than we put in,” said the proposal written by Scoopy. “It has turned our greatest expense into a large driver of revenue for the protocol.”  See also: DeFi Lending Protocol Alchemix Raises $4.9M in Round Led by CMS, Alameda  Scoopy’s proposal posits this setup will boost alAssets by making it more profitable for traders to deposit into Alchemix-linked liquidity pools, prompting more traders to do so. AMOs, or Algorithmic Market Operators, are themselves price support mechanisms from an earlier protocol upgrade.  It would also increase buying pressure on ALCX, the proposal said. ALCX was trading around $20.30 at press time. It is up nearly 50% in 2023 amid the crypto market rally but remains well off its all-time highs. Alchemix’s total value locked at $57 million, per DeFiLlama.  If all goes to plan, the proposal sees an increase in Alchemix’s CRV and CVX revenue generated by its alAsset trading pools, currently projected around $300,000 a month. This revenue is what will partly fund the new buyback and bribe program. Previously, Alchemix sent half of its “harvest” to its treasury and staked half into Curve and Convex, but now those levels drop to a third.  Scoopy’s proposal suggested the new model should generate enough revenue to “cover all expenses and leave the treasury with a moderate surplus.” The treasury currently has $1 million in stablecoins and $2 million in ether against an annual burn as high as $1.2 million.  After a three-day voting period the proposal passed Monday with 81 wallets participating with their governance tokens. Eighty one percent of voted ALCX moved in favor of the proposal and 18% abstained, with only a fraction against it.

Still, the company, formerly known as Riot Blockchain, experienced a reduction in its deployed mining fleet and hash rate capacity driven by recent damage to Buildings F and G of its Texas-based Rockdale facility from severe winter weather. ""Repairs have been ongoing in both buildings,"" said Riot CEO Jason Les, ""and we have successfully brought Building F back online, representing 0.6 EH/s of impacted hash rate capacity.""

Visco spoke of the importance of regulating crypto, and outlined global, European and Italian initiatives underway during a speech on the global economic situation in Milan. Although the economies of Italy and the euro area are decelerating because the sector's ties to traditional finance are weak, last year's crypto market collapse did not have any ""systemic consequences"" on ""the real economy,"" he said.  He added that Bank of Italy surveys showed only about 2% of Italian households held ""modest amounts, on average"" of crypto and that the exposure of Italian intermediaries to the market was also very limited.  Nonetheless, the country's regulators are preparing for the forthcoming EU crypto rules under the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, which are due to be voted on for a final time in April. MiCA sets up licensing requirements for crypto issuers and service providers including exchange platforms. The central bank is working with local financial markets regulator Consob and the Ministry of Economy and Finance on setting up the ""authorization and supervision activities"" laid out in MiCA.  Italy had previously set up a mandatory registration requirement for crypto firms operating in the country, but, by the end of last year the regulator responsible had not vetted the companies it had approved. As of Monday, the list had 91 virtual asset service providers.  The Bank of Italy is also working on various applications of distributed ledger technology (DLT) including the EU's own pilot for regulation of market infrastructures, according to Visco.  A distinction ought to be made on crypto ""with no intrinsic value"" that ""divert resources from productive activities and collective wellbeing,"" the governor said. While these must be ""strongly discouraged,"" innovations that can help improve the efficiency of financial systems should be fostered, he added.

Bitcoin began to fall on Thursday after posting an upward trajectory in January, when it gained 40%, according to data from TradingView. Monday’s drop comes as Wall Street equity futures and European stocks dipped following Friday’s unexpectedly strong jobs report from the U.S. The rest of the crypto market was also trading in the red on Monday.  South Korea's Financial Services Commission on Monday published guidelines on which security tokens will qualify for regulation under the country's capital markets rules. The guidance comes ahead of highly anticipated regulations that will institutionalize security tokens. South Korea is working on comprehensive regulations for the crypto and blockchain sector, with lawmakers of the country's National Assembly considering 17 separate related proposals.  Sam Bankman-Fried showered politicians with tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions before his FTX empire imploded in November. Now, the bankrupt crypto exchange wants that money back. On Sunday, FTX Group said it is sending “confidential letters” to politicians and other political beneficiaries of Bankman-Fried, his deputies and his companies, asking them to return the money by the end of the month. In a press release the firm said it reserved the right to try and force repayments – plus interest – through court action.

42393920,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc4Ud,1675687706,The Rise of Crypto's Brand of Regenerative Finance,"When society broke down, the people stepped up. This is what Manuel Alzuru observed in 2020, during the depths of Covid, when he moved to Barcelona. He had just caught Covid. “And there was no help,” Alzuru says now. “All of the hospitals and clinics had completely collapsed.”  Then Alzuru noticed something in his building. Something surprising. Something even wonderful. People had put sticky notes on the front door of the apartment building that said things like, “The neighbor on the fifth floor needs medicine,” or “The neighbor on the third floor needs food.” Alzuru saw similar notes on other buildings. He realized that the government might have failed, but the neighbors rallied to do the right thing.  Alzuru loved the spirit of this generosity, but he was surprised there wasn’t a more structured system to coordinate the aid. “It was kind of crazy that there are applications for showing your ass and showing your muscles [like dating apps], but there’s no applications for helping each other out.”  So he created FightPandemics, an online portal to connect the people who needed help with those who wanted to give. Then he took the idea one step further. Alzuru had already dabbled in Web3 (contributing to a few early decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs), so he launched a project called DoinGud, which began as an NFT marketplace that used proceeds to fund charitable causes. It’s now an ecosystem intended to fund worthy causes.  “The idea is that we come together from all over the world, and that we start to decide what is creating impact,” says Alzuru, with cheerful energy in his voice. “Instead of relying on governments, we come together and we self-organize.”  Regens revolt  DoinGud is one of the growing number of “Regenerative Finance” projects, or “ReFi,” which can be loosely thought of as a counter to “Degen” culture, as in degenerative gambling. The Degens care about making money on crypto, the Regens care about doing good. Imagine stripping Web3 of its price speculation looking only at the social impact.  “I think of regenerative finance as a system that increases its resource capacity over time,” says Kevin Owocki, a software engineer and one of the leading voices of ReFi. Owocki is the co-founder of GitCoin (which uses crypto to fund open-sourced projects) and the author of the book “Greenpilled: How Crypto Can Regenerate the World,” which is something of a Regenerative Finance manifesto.  For Owocki, ReFi is a way to replenish the “public goods,” and that can take many forms. “We don’t just want to regenerate our wallets,” he says. “We want to regenerate our material capital, our cultural capital, our intellectual capital, our spiritual capital.”  The scope of ReFi is still a little fuzzy and up for debate. “I don’t think it’s something that’s super well-defined,” says Paul J. Dylan-Ennis, a professor at the University College Dublin who studies cryptocurrencies and has written about Regenerative Finance. He describes your typical “Regen” as an Ethereum enthusiast who’s “trying to build infrastructure that’s long-lasting,” and often focused on “climate-friendly-type projects.” (Although both Owocki and Alzuru are quick to clarify that the scope of ReFi is broader than the environment and sustainability.)  See also: From Degen to Regen: How Web3 Started Playing Positive-Sum Games / Opinion  The “Greenpilled” book includes prefaces and endorsements from heavy-hitters like Vitalik Buterin, Glen Weyl (of RadicalXChange, a nonprofit organization that advocates for political and economic reform) and the “Network State’s” Balaji Srinivasan, who (in the book) gives this encapsulation of Regenerative cryptoeconomics: “Like renewable energy of the nuclear variety, it helps make crypto sustainable. It’s not zero-sum gambling, or negative-sum hacking. It’s positive-sum wealth creation.”  These are a lot of abstract theories. What does it look like in reality? Arguably the most consequential ReFi project to date is Gitcoin, launched in 2017 (it predates the term ReFi), which claims to have funded $72 million across over 3,000 open source projects. Some of these were tiny seed projects that grew into juggernauts like UniSwap and Yearn.  Then there’s the Regen Network, a blockchain-imbued marketplace that does things like tokenize carbon credits. Or Giveth, which describes itself as “the future of giving,” and lets people donate crypto to projects such as experiments with universal basic income, giving school supplies to children and “relocating Web3 Iranians.”  This is just a small sampling. TheReFiDAO shares more examples in a recent blog post (which cheerfully framed 2022 as “The Year of Regenerative Finance”) and Owocki highlights others in a recent essay for CoinDesk, expecting 2023 to be the year of “regenerative cryptoeconomics.”  Rising sun  Regen weaves in the concepts of quadratic funding (developed in part by Glen Weyl and Vitalik Buterin as a more effective way to determine what projects should be prioritized), the Network State (you can read my recent deep-dive) and a bit of wide-eyed optimism. Consider the “Solar Punks.”  Manuel Alzuru is a Solar Punk. He describes it as a form of technological optimism. “I suffer a lot from my government. But I don’t want to be a victim. I don’t want to live in fear. I choose to not live in fear. I choose to live in love. And a lot of people who call themselves Solar Punks had similar values.”  You know those renderings of futuristic cities that have flying cars and lush greenery all over the buildings? That’s Solar Punk. Then Alzuru throws me a curveball: “To be honest, I don’t like the label anymore,” he says, because of a quasi-rivalry with the “Lunar Punks.” (Dylan-Ennis wrote a CoinDesk explainer on the Solarpunk/Lunarpunk distinction, and Owocki breaks it down in detail on his GreenPill podcast.)  But even the optimistic Alzuru acknowledges that ReFi has been hurt by crypto winter. During the bear market, “funding has been terrible for regenerative projects. Terrible,” says Alzuru. He says that the treasuries of many ReFi projects have slimmed, that DoinGud has been forced to trim its team and that “We’re basically all just trying to survive this bear market.”  Owocki agrees that funding has slowed but thinks of crypto winter as the “culling of the herd,” or even a form of natural selection, with projects that survive likely to become the “keystone species” moving forward. In other words, donors are “being more choosey,” he says.  See also: Crypto for Good: How to Donate Crypto and Who Accepts It / Learn  Dylan-Ennis even considers the bear market as a blessing for ReFi. “Crypto winter works in its favor,” he says. “It sharpens their message that we’ll be trapped in these four-year cycles [of price booms and busts] forever unless we can break the culture, and that’s going to involve introducing some sort of philosophy.”  Now that philosophy seems to be gaining traction. “The movement is going to keep growing, for sure,” says Alzuru, who still thinks of those sticky notes from people who wanted to help. “A social awakening is happening. This is the very beginning.”",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/02/06/the-rise-of-cryptos-brand-of-regenerative-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e522e154933869fbbfceb683ca0231f504cc55a-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The free tool can support reporting of up to 100,000 transactions and is available initially to users in Canada and France. The exchange has plans to extend it to other regions, it said in a blog post Monday.  ""In one click, you can now import your Binance transactions into our calculator and obtain a simple yet comprehensive estimate of your tax obligations depending on your jurisdiction,"" Binance said on Monday.  Several countries have introduced firmer requirements around taxation of crypto assets in recent months. At the end of last year Italy brought in a 26% tax on crypto trading gains in excess of 2,000 euros ($2,160). Meanwhile, India this month added teeth to its crypto tax rules, with a provision for jail time of up to 84 months introduced for noncompliance with reporting requirements.  The aim of Binance Tax is to simplify the calculation of gains and losses throughout the year. For frequent traders, this could amount to thousands of transactions, meaning many hours of work to ensure correct calculation.

The guidance comes ahead of highly anticipated regulations that will institutionalize security tokens.  South Korea is working to regulate the crypto and blockchain sector comprehensively, with lawmakers of the country's National Assembly considering 17 separate crypto-related legislative frameworks. The discussions are aimed at creating the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA), an all-encompassing legal framework for regulating Korea's dynamic crypto industry.  Read more: South Korean Lawmakers Are Gearing Up to Regulate Crypto. What Could That Look Like?  Security tokens refer to the digitalization of securities under the Capital Markets Act using distributed ledger technology, according to the guidance, and will apply only to digital assets that qualify. The guidance clarifies that stablecoins, which are crypto pegged to the value of other currencies such as the U.S. dollar and are used for payments or as a medium of exchange, will likely not fall under the definition of securities. Digital assets that have no issuer and do not have to ""fulfill the obligations commensurate with the investor's rights,"" will also likely fall outside of the scope of security tokens.  ""On the other hand, digital assets corresponding to securities must be issued and distributed in compliance with all securities regulations under the Capital Markets Act,"" the FSC said.  The planned rules are aimed at supporting innovation while ensuring consumer protection, according to the guidelines.

Daily fees on the blockchain have more than doubled since the start of the year from around $2 million to $4 million-$6 million, the report said. Ether (ETH) has gained around 35% in value.  Bernstein notes that ether inflation has remained negative for over two weeks, with the expectation of further deflation with more on-chain activity and demand.  “We do believe BTC [bitcoin] and ETH remain relatively clean here and will see gradual conviction-based spot positioning,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  The next big catalyst for Ethereum remains the Shanghai upgrade due in mid-March, when withdrawals of staked ether will be enabled, the note said.  There may be some caution heading into this event because of concerns around supply from the unstaked ether as 70% of the ETH staked has been through liquid staking pools such as LIDO or led by exchanges, the report said.  The remaining ether has been directly staked into the Beacon Chain and is unlikely to be short-term holders. Therefore, there may be caution approaching the event, “but improved conviction in holding in spot markets, as the fears recede,” the report added.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin dipped below $23K earlier in the weekend and flattened on Sunday as investors await the next utterances from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.  Insights: If crypto continues to rebound, venture capital in blockchain projects is likely to rise. Will venture capitalists avoid their past investment mistakes in the blockchain space?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,088 −14.6 ▼ 1.3% Bitcoin (BTC) $23,059 −208.2 ▼ 0.9% Ethereum (ETH) $1,639 −21.7 ▼ 1.3% S&P 500  4,136.48 −43.3 ▼ 1.0% Gold  $1,880 +16.7 ▲ 0.9% Nikkei 225  27,509.46 +107.4 ▲ 0.4% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Crypto Trades Flat as Investors Await Powell Speech, More Earnings  By Sam Reynolds  Major digital asset prices traded flat over the weekend, with bitcoin down 1.7% and ether in the red 2.3% over the weekend.  After a mediocre start to earnings season, investors are thought to be looking ahead to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech before the Economic Club in Washington, D.C., scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, before making any big moves.  FactSet data shows that less than 1% of the companies in the S&P 500 reported earnings that were above estimates. This is below the five-year average of 8.6%, and the 10-year average of 6.4%.  ""As a result, the earnings decline for the fourth quarter is larger today compared to the end of last week and compared to the end of the quarter,"" FactSet's senior earnings analyst John Butters wrote in a Friday market update. ""If the index reports an actual decline in earnings for Q4 2022, it will mark the first year-over-year decline in earnings reported by the index since Q3 2020.”  Speaking late last week on CoinDesk TV, David Siemer, CEO of SEC-registered, digital asset investment manager Wave Financial, said that the market is giving mixed signals – strong job numbers, but mediocre earnings results – and he still expects a recession this year, albeit a weak one.  “I am a little more optimistic that it won't be quite as severe a recession as in a great recession or major, major recession,” he said, pointing to the resilience of consumers. “The fact that the Fed's actions are having such a slow effect doesn't mean cumulatively they won't eventually have a major effect. We're probably still a quarter or two away from seeing what the Fed's actions have really actually done to the economy.”  And what does this mean to crypto prices, looking forward? Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BiBull Capital, wrote in a note to CoinDesk that crypto markets are “optimistic” after a modest rate increase and bitcoin will “oscillate around the $20K support level for the next few months, barring other unforeseen events and market action.”  Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is opening the Asia trading week at 103.12, staying in what many analysts call a “defensive” position. The measure of the world’s largest fiat asset spent most of last year surging, hitting stock and crypto prices hard. Year-to-date it’s down 1.4%.

By Sam Reynolds  The last quarter of 2021 was the end of an unprecedented bull market that began the year before with COVID-included macroeconomic policy and finished with the Fed raising rates in 2022, and with a trio of collapses, most notably crypto exchange FTX and its trading arm Alameda Research. Venture capitalists enjoyed the ride on the way up, but certainly felt the pain on the way down in 2022 as cascading failures knocked the wind out of their portfolios.  For the industry, the trillion-dollar question will be: Did VCs learn anything, and can they avoid repeating the mistakes of last year that severely dented their profits. VCs invested furiously as crypto prices rose but their methods often seemed slapdash.  An upbeat January  Bitcoin and many altcoin categories had a fantastic January, with the world’s largest digital asset rising 40% on-month, some metaverse tokens making triple-digit gains and layer 1s such as Aptos’ APT rising by over 300%. Some of the more bullish takes even predict bitcoin hitting $45,000 by Christmas.  But despite these data points indicating that crypto winter is thawing, VCs' investment in digital asset and blockchain projects fell 90% in January, according to a recent CoinDesk report.  ""Over the past 18 months, VC investments into crypto reached a peak, with investments spread across the entire ecosystem. Diligence cycles were compressed to weeks and sometimes days during this time, with many investors shunned out of the round if they asked crypto startups follow-up diligence questions (this is partly why FTX was not properly diligenced),” Robert Le, a senior emerging technology analyst at Pitchbook, told CoinDesk in an email.  Le said that during the past six months, there has been a significant slowdown in the speed at which VCs do deals, with the diligence cycle now taking months.  “Capital is now concentrated into areas with business models and product market fit. There is also less appetite for pure token rounds, with many investors preferring equity,"" Le said.  Throughout the 2020-22 bull market cycle, many observers found it almost comical how many projects of questionable merit, teams with negligible skills, and projects without a proper fit received a seemingly, never-ending bucket of funding.  The stats are sobering: CertiK says there was more than $3.7 billion in tokens stolen, scammed, or attacked in 2022; in 2021 there were over $2.8 billion in rug pulls, a term for teams absconding with investors’ tokens.  “Investors were very willing to underwrite risk, bet on exploratory and niche products, and take an optimistic view of the space,” Nate George, venture capital co-lead at Cumberland, told CoinDesk.  George said that investors tolerated poorly constructed legal documents with extremely limited investor protections, just to get into the sector. In turn, throughout the 2021-22 cycle, funds employed a “scattershot approach” to investing with large collections of investors writing small checks demonstrating their low conviction to the project.  Effectively everyone who wanted it got funding.  “Startups were able to raise uncharacteristically sized rounds for their stage, commonly acquiring multiple years of runway pre-product, while over the course of the last six months, investors pivoted to underwriting fewer deals targeting higher conviction, more concentrated bets,” George told CoinDesk in a note. “During this period of time, investors began to re-evaluate their focus on what constitutes product market fit, realizing that large token incentive programs rewarding user participation creates distorted traction metrics and overlooks user stickiness.”  Moving into spring  A lot must be going through investors’ minds at the moment. On one hand, there’s lots of data – in the form of bloody red losses on profit-and-loss statements – to show that a slower, high-conviction approach to investing is better for both the industry and the fund’s return.  But at the same time, this is the season of altcoins. SHIB is up nearly 50% this past month. Metaverse tokens, despite the questionable traction platforms like Decentraland have, are doing very well.  Data from CryptoRank shows that smaller, more nimble funds are making the triple-digit returns.  And what are they investing in? Lesser-known protocols. The stuff that climbs fast and falls hard. Stuff that would be part of a “scattershot” portfolio.  That’s not to say that the largest funds aren’t doing well in the last month.  Coinbase Ventures, which was very busy throughout 2022 with 121 closed deals, according to Pitchbook, has seen its token portfolio rise by 56% over the past month. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is around the same. Animoca Brands, which was rumored to be suffering from serious financial strife at the end of last year, has had its fortunes turn around in a big way.  But which thesis will win?
