21440270,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564034,1702684792,How To Trade Crypto,"How to trade crypto – a question that resonates with many in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Whether you’re a novice eager to learn how to crypto trade or an experienced crypto trader looking to refine your strategies, this guide is your comprehensive resource. From understanding the best time to trade crypto to exploring the best cryptos to day trade, we’ll delve into every aspect you need to know. What Makes A Crypto Trader? A successful crypto trader is not just someone who knows how to trade crypto, but an individual equipped with a unique set of skills, especially in technical analysis. Technical analysis is the cornerstone of crypto trade decisions. It involves interpreting market data and price charts to forecast future price movements. This skill is particularly crucial for those who day trade crypto or engage in short-term trading strategies like crypto scalping. Technical analysis in crypto trading often involves understanding and utilizing various tools and indicators. For instance, a proficient crypto trader should be adept at reading candlestick charts, which are fundamental in identifying market trends and potential reversals. Knowledge of trend lines, chart patterns, indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) as well as moving averages is also vital in making informed decisions about when to enter or exit a trade. Apart from technical skills, a crypto trader must also have a strong psychological makeup. The ability to remain calm under pressure and maintain discipline, especially in volatile market conditions, is what separates seasoned traders from novices. This mental fortitude is especially important in high-stakes trading scenarios, such as when one is learning how to leverage trade crypto or engage in crypto futures trading. Why Trade Crypto? Trading cryptocurrency offers unique advantages that make it an appealing market for many investors and traders. Here are some key reasons why people choose to trade crypto: Market Volatility: While volatility is often viewed as a risk, for the savvy crypto trader, it presents numerous opportunities for profit. The rapid price fluctuations in the crypto market can result in significant gains, especially for those skilled in crypto trade strategies like day trading or swing trading. Accessibility And Liquidity: The crypto market operates 24/7, offering unmatched accessibility compared to traditional financial markets. This around-the-clock trading capability allows crypto traders to react instantly to market news and events. Additionally, the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies has led to higher liquidity, making it easier to execute trades quickly and at desired prices. Potential For High Returns: Cryptocurrencies have been known for their potential to yield high returns. Though high returns come with high risks, traders who have learned how to trade crypto effectively, particularly those who engage in strategies like day trade crypto, can capitalize on these opportunities. Diversification: For investors looking to diversify their portfolio, cryptocurrencies offer an alternative asset class that is not directly correlated with traditional financial markets. This diversification can be a hedge against inflation or market downturns in other sectors. Democratization Of Finance: Crypto trading provides a level of inclusivity and democratization not always present in traditional financial markets. Getting Started: How To Trade Crypto When it comes to crypto trading , the initial steps involve laying a strong foundation and acquiring the necessary tools and mindset. Here’s a fundamental guide to getting started: Understanding The Market Dynamics: Before any actual trading, it’s crucial to grasp the unique dynamics of the crypto market. This includes understanding the factors that influence cryptocurrency prices, such as market demand, technological developments, regulatory news, and broader economic factors. Developing A Crypto Trader’s Mindset: Trading crypto requires a particular mindset. It involves patience, discipline, and a willingness to learn continuously. Developing a mindset that can handle the ups and downs of the market is as important as any technical skill. Basic Risk Management Principles: Before executing your first trade, understand the basic principles of risk management. This includes only investing what you can afford to lose, understanding the volatility of the market, and knowledge about the different order types. Exploring Different Cryptocurrencies: While many beginners start with well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, there’s a wide array of cryptocurrencies to explore. The smaller the market cap of an alternative cryptocurrency (“altcoin“), the more volatile it tends to be. Mid and small caps often have even greater profit potential, but also greater risks. Staying Informed And Updated: The crypto market is fast-paced and constantly evolving. Keeping yourself updated with the latest news and trends is crucial. This involves following crypto news, joining online communities, and possibly using social media to track real-time updates. Crypto Trade Strategies (With Pros And Cons) Choosing a crypto trade is one of the first challenges for potential crypto traders. You need to align your strategy with your goals, risk tolerance, and time commitment. Each strategy comes with its own set of advantages and challenges. Day-Trade Crypto Day trading in crypto involves buying and selling cryptocurrencies within the same trading day. Traders capitalize on short-term market movements to make profits. Pros: The primary advantage of day trading is the potential for quick profits due to the high volatility of the crypto market. It also limits exposure to overnight market risks since positions aren’t held beyond a day. Day trading is highly engaging and can be very rewarding for those who have the time to monitor the market constantly. Cons: However, day trading is time-consuming and requires constant market analysis, which can be stressful. It also demands a good understanding of market trends and technical analysis. The high frequency of trades can lead to significant transaction fees, and the fast-paced nature of this strategy can amplify losses just as quickly as gains. Crypto Scalping Scalping is a strategy where crypto traders make profits from small price changes, often entering and exiting positions within minutes. Pros: Scalping allows traders to profit from even the smallest market movements, making it a good strategy in both volatile and stable market conditions. It also reduces exposure to long-term market risks. Cons: Scalping requires immense discipline and a strict exit strategy to prevent significant losses. It’s a high-intensity strategy, demanding constant attention and quick decision-making. Scalping also typically involves a large number of trades, which can result in high transaction costs. Crypto Swing Trading Swing trading involves holding onto cryptocurrencies for several days or weeks to capitalize on expected upward or downward market shifts. Pros: This strategy is less time-consuming than day trading or scalping, allowing traders more time to analyze the market. Swing traders can capture more significant price shifts than day traders, potentially leading to higher profits. Cons: Swing trading involves the risk of holding positions overnight or longer, exposing the trader to unforeseen market changes. It also requires a good understanding of market trends and the patience to wait for the right moment to enter or exit a trade. Position Trading Position trading is a long-term strategy where traders hold their positions for months or even years, based on their analysis of long-term market trends. Pros: This strategy requires less time to monitor daily market fluctuations and can yield substantial returns if the long-term market trend predictions are accurate. Position traders are less affected by short-term volatility. Cons: The main downside is that capital is tied up for a long time, making it unavailable for other investment opportunities. It also requires a deep understanding of the market and strong conviction in one’s predictions, as holding positions through market ups and downs can be challenging. How To Trade Crypto: Step-By-Step Guide Trading crypto can seem daunting at first, but by following a structured approach, you can navigate the process with greater ease. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started: Preparation: How To Become A Good Crypto Trader Choose A Cryptocurrency Exchange: The first step is selecting a cryptocurrency exchange. Look for platforms known for their security, user-friendly interface, and the range of cryptocurrencies they offer. Popular exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken are a good starting point. Set Up Your Trading Account: Once you’ve chosen an exchange, set up your trading account. This process will typically require you to provide personal information and complete a verification process to comply with regulatory requirements. Deposit Funds: After your account is set up, you’ll need to deposit funds. You can do this either by transferring fiat currency (like USD, EUR) into your account or by depositing cryptocurrencies from a digital wallet. Develop A Trading Plan: Before you start trading, it’s crucial to have a plan. This should include your investment goals, risk tolerance, and the trading strategy you intend to use (like day trade crypto, swing trading, etc.). Start With A Demo Account (If Available): Many platforms offer demo accounts where you can practice trading with virtual money. This is a great way to get a feel for the market dynamics and test your trading strategy without risking real money. Start Crypto Trading Begin Trading: Once you’re comfortable, start trading. This involves placing buy or sell orders on your chosen exchange. Start with smaller amounts to get a feel for the market and gradually increase your trading size as you gain more confidence and experience. Monitor Your Trades And Adjust Your Strategy: Continuously monitor your trades and the market. Be prepared to adjust your strategy if the market conditions change. It’s important to stay flexible and responsive to market dynamics. Practice Risk Management And Learn: Always keep an eye on your risk exposure and use tools like stop-loss orders to protect your investments. After each trading session, reflect on what you’ve learned, what worked, and what didn’t. Continuous learning and adaptation are key to becoming a successful crypto trader. Securing Your Cryptocurrencies Securing your cryptocurrencies is a crucial aspect of trading and investing in the digital currency space. Here’s how you can ensure the security of your assets: Use Trusted Wallets: There are two main types of wallets: hot wallets (online wallets) and cold wallets (offline or hardware wallets). While hot wallets are convenient for frequent traders, cold wallets provide better security for long-term storage. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Always enable 2FA on your trading accounts and wallets. This adds an extra layer of security. If your password is compromised, the attacker cannot access your funds without the second authentication factor. Be Wary Of Phishing Attempts: Be vigilant about phishing attempts. These usually come in the form of emails or messages that try to trick you into revealing your security credentials. Use Strong And Unique Passwords: For each account and wallet, use strong, unique passwords. Avoid reusing passwords across different platforms. Keep Your Software Updated: Ensure that your wallet software, as well as your computer’s or smartphone’s operating system, is regularly updated. Backup Your Wallet: Regularly backup your wallet, especially if you’re using a desktop or mobile wallet. This ensures that you can recover your cryptocurrencies in case your device is lost, stolen, or damaged. Be Cautious With Public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing your crypto wallets or trading accounts over public Wi-Fi networks. These networks are often not secure! Best Cryptos To Day Trade Selecting the best cryptos to day trade is a nuanced process that hinges on several key factors. As a day trader, your focus should be on finding cryptocurrencies that not only exhibit high volatility but also possess substantial liquidity and trading volume. This ensures that you can enter and exit positions quickly and at desirable prices. Factors To Consider: Liquidity is paramount in day trading. Highly liquid cryptocurrencies allow for smoother transactions without causing significant price shifts upon entry or exit. Larger, well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum typically offer higher liquidity, making them reliable choices for day trading. Trading volume is another critical aspect. In general, cryptos with high daily trading volumes are preferred as they indicate active trading activity, which in turn suggests more opportunities for price movements that day traders can exploit. On the other, a strategy can involve trading altcoins with low liquidity, making it vulnerable for larger price swings. Beyond liquidity and volume, a crypto trader should also look at the technical aspects like chart patterns and indicators. Cryptocurrencies that show clear and predictable patterns can be more manageable for crypto traders who rely on technical analysis. Indicators such as moving averages, RSI, and MACD are tools often used to analyze and predict short-term price movements in these volatile markets. Furthermore, being cognizant of the current trends in the crypto market can provide an edge. For instance, if there’s growing interest in specific sectors like GameFi or AI altcoins, these could present unique trading opportunities. These sectors might exhibit increased volatility and trading volume, creating favorable conditions for day trading. Overall, it’s crucial to balance technical considerations with a sense of market sentiment and news. Best Platform To Trade Crypto Selecting the best platform to trade crypto is a critical decision for any trader. Based on spot trading volume, here are the top platforms: Binance: Binance leads with a spot trading volume of approximately $15.48 billion in the last 24 hours. Known for its vast range of cryptocurrencies (over 1,475 markets), it supports multiple fiat currencies like EUR, GBP, and BRL. Binance is favored for its comprehensive tools, features, and relatively low fees​​. Coinbase Exchange: With a trading volume of around $2.51 billion in the last 24 hours, Coinbase is renowned for its user-friendly interface, making it ideal for beginners. It supports major currencies like USD, EUR, and GBP and offers a balance between accessibility and comprehensive trading features​​. Kraken: with a trading volume of $1.08 billion, is praised for its security and extensive range of cryptocurrencies (over 768 markets). It supports various fiat currencies, including USD, EUR, and GBP, and is known for its robust security measures​​. OKX: has a significant trading volume of about $3.72 billion. It offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies (over 659 markets) and supports diverse fiat options including AED, ARS, AUD, and 43 more. OKX is recognized for its variety of trading options and comprehensive platform​​. Bybit: with a trading volume of $3.08 billion, stands out for its advanced trading features and support for USD, EUR, GBP, among others. It is particularly popular among crypto traders looking for derivatives trading options​​. Where To Trade Crypto? Choosing where to trade crypto involves careful consideration of various factors. Here’s a guide to help you make an informed decision: Security: Prioritize platforms with robust security measures. Look for features like two-factor authentication, cold storage options, and a track record of handling security breaches, if any. Fees: Compare the fee structures of different platforms. Lower transaction fees can make a significant difference, especially for frequent traders. User Interface And Experience: For beginners, a user-friendly interface is key. For experienced crypto traders, advanced trading tools and features are important. Range Of Cryptocurrencies: Consider platforms that offer a wide range of cryptocurrencies. This allows for diversification and the ability to trade in lesser-known, potentially more volatile coins. Liquidity: High liquidity ensures that you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies quickly and at prices close to the market rate. Regulatory Compliance: Opt for platforms that adhere to regulatory standards. This can offer a level of protection and legitimacy. Customer Support: Good customer support can be crucial, especially in resolving issues swiftly. Community And Reputation: A platform’s reputation within the crypto community and its overall track record can provide insights into its reliability and performance. Additional Features: Some platforms offer additional features like staking, margin trading, or crypto savings accounts, which might align with your trading goals. Geographical Restrictions: Ensure the platform is available and legal in your region. Crypto Trade 101: Technical Analysis Candlestick Charts Candlestick charts are essential for understanding market movements in crypto trading. Each candlestick represents price movements within a specific timeframe. The ‘body’ shows the opening and closing prices, while ‘wicks’ indicate the high and low. Crypto traders look for patterns like ‘Doji’ (indicating indecision) or ‘Bullish Engulfing’ (signaling a potential upward trend) to predict future price movements. Trend Lines And Triangle Patterns Both patterns are vital tools in technical analysis for crypto traders. Trend Lines: You draw straight lines on price charts that connect a series of highs or lows. In an uptrend, an upward trend line connects the higher lows, indicating support levels where the price gains strength and bounces upwards. In contrast, a downward trend line in a downtrend connects lower highs, marking resistance levels. Breaking through a trend line often signals a potential change in the market trend. Triangle Patterns: These are formed by drawing two converging trend lines as prices move in a narrowing range. There are three types: Ascending Triangle: Formed by a horizontal resistance line and an upward sloping trend line. It often indicates a continuation of an uptrend, especially if the price breaks above the resistance line. Descending Triangle: Characterized by a horizontal support line and a downward sloping trend line. This pattern typically signals a continuation of a downtrend, particularly if the price breaks below the support line. Symmetrical Triangle: Created when the slope of the price’s highs and the slope of the price’s lows converge to a point. This pattern indicates that a breakout is imminent, but it does not predict the direction. The breakout direction of the price out of the triangle can signal the continuation of the trend or a reversal. Crypto traders use these patterns to make predictions about future price movements. A breakout above or below a triangle pattern often signals a strong move in the direction of the breakout. However, it’s crucial to confirm these signals with other indicators and market factors. Moving Averages Moving Averages (MAs) are crucial indicators in crypto trading, used to smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends. The two most common types are: Simple Moving Average (SMA): This is the average price over a specific number of time periods. It’s calculated by adding up the closing prices over a set period and then dividing by the number of periods. SMA gives equal weight to all prices in the period. Exponential Moving Average (EMA): EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information. It is calculated similarly to SMA but incorporates a weighting multiplier that exponentially decreases the weight of older prices. Crypto traders use MAs to identify support and resistance levels. For example, a rising MA indicates support, suggesting an uptrend, while a falling MA indicates resistance, suggesting a downtrend. MAs also serve in crossover strategies: A short-term MA crossing above a long-term MA signals a potential upward trend (bullish crossover), while crossing below indicates a potential downward trend (bearish crossover). However, combining these indicators with other analysis tools is advisable, as they can lag the current market price due to their reliance on averaging past data. Relative Strength Index (RSI) RSI is a momentum indicator, ranging from 0 to 100, that assesses whether a crypto is overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30). Crypto traders use it to spot potential reversal points. For instance, if RSI rises above 70, it signals that the market is red hot, while a value above 90 is almost a guarantee for a near term price pullback. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) The MACD consists of two lines – the MACD line (the difference between two EMAs) and a signal line. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it suggests a bullish trend, and a cross below indicates a bearish trend. Divergences between MACD and price can also indicate potential market reversals. For Advanced Crypto Traders Advanced crypto trading, such as day trading and options trading, requires a sophisticated understanding of the market and specific strategies. How To Day Trade Crypto Day trading crypto is about exploiting short-term market fluctuations. It’s not just about buying low and selling high within a day but also involves nuanced strategies like playing on news-based volatility or using specific technical indicators for quick entry and exit points. An example is a day trader focusing on a particular cryptocurrency that has announced a major partnership. The crypto trader uses tools like RSI and MACD to determine the optimal entry and exit points within the day, capitalizing on the news-induced volatility. How To Trade Crypto Options Crypto options trading involves more complex strategies compared to regular trading. For instance, a crypto trader might buy a ‘call option’ if they anticipate the price of a cryptocurrency to rise before a specific date. Conversely, a ‘put option’ might be purchased if they expect the price to fall. This method requires a deep understanding of market sentiment and potential triggers for price movements. A practical example would be a crypto trader buying options ahead of a significant event, like a blockchain upgrade, betting that this event will cause substantial price movement. Two major styles of options exist: European-style, which can only be exercised on the expiration date, and American-style, which can be exercised any time before expiration. For trading crypto options, some of the most renowned platforms include Binance, Deribit (known for being the most liquid crypto options trading platform), OKX, Bybit, Delta Exchange, and CME (a regulated exchange in the United States)​​. Risk Management in Crypto Trading Effective risk management is vital in crypto trading to protect your investments and ensure long-term success. Setting Stop-Loss Orders: Stop-loss orders are an essential tool. They automatically sell an asset when it reaches a certain price, limiting potential losses. If you buy a cryptocurrency at $100 and set a stop-loss order at $90, the asset will automatically sell if its price drops to $90, thereby limiting your loss to 10%. Diversifying Your Portfolio: Diversification involves spreading your investments across various assets to reduce risk. Instead of putting all your capital into a single cryptocurrency, diversify across different coins, sectors, or even different asset classes. Avoiding Emotional Trading: Emotional trading often leads to impulsive decisions, like chasing losses or making overconfident trades. To combat this, develop a trading plan and stick to it, making decisions based on logic and analysis rather than emotion. It’s also helpful to set predetermined entry and exit points for trades to avoid emotional biases. Implementing these risk management strategies can significantly improve your trading outcomes and help in maintaining a more stable and sustainable trading career in the volatile crypto market.

This shows a commitment to pushing the price of the meme coin even higher at a time when large cap altcoins are not really getting much attention. Given this, the SHIB price has traded in a tight range for a while now, something that could either make or break the price. Shiba Inu Trading In A Descending Parallel Pattern Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a pattern that the Shiba Inu price has been trading inside recently. Using a price chart of the altcoin, the crypto analyst shows that SHIB has continued to trade inside what is known as a descending parallel pattern. Related Reading: Terra Classic Validator Presents ‘Legally Absolved Route’ To Burn 800 Million USTC Now, descending parallel patterns only show up in an asset when there are a lot of prominent downtrends in the price of that asset over time. Due to this, the appearance of a descending parallel pattern is often very bearish for the price. However, it is not all bad news given that descending parallel patterns can also lead to a surge in the price of an asset. As Martinez outlines in his analysis, the current pattern being exhibited by the SHIB price can end up going one of two ways. The first of these is the bullish path which could lead to a breakout. In this case, the analyst maintains that there needs to be a decisive weekly breakout which could push the price toward $0.000014. On the flip side of this thought is the more bearish path that could signal a drop back to October levels. This happens is the price of SHIB ends up facing a region which could lead to a cascade of downward movement. In this case, the meme coin could fall back to $0.000008 once more.

The momentum began with Coinbase’s listing, followed closely by Binance’s surprise announcement, propelling BONK to new heights and generating enthusiasm within the crypto community. Astounding 1,000% Surge On Binance And Coinbase Listings The listing on Binance proved to be a game-changer for BONK, as its price skyrocketed above $0.00003, marking an astounding increase of over 1,000% in just one month. The frenzy surrounding the memecoin became evident when a trader sold 52.3 billion BONK tokens, equivalent to approximately $927,000, and realized a staggering profit of around $784,000. According to Lookonchain, this trader had purchased 69 billion BONK at a price of approximately $0.0000021 and staked them from October 30 to November 29, reaping substantial returns from the meteoric rise of BONK. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin 2023 Bull Run Releases New Target Beyond the price surge, another noteworthy development has captured the attention of investors. The Solana community has witnessed a surge in the sales of Solana phones, driven by the recent price hike of Solana’s memecoin. Raj Gokal, the co-founder of Solana, shared in a December 15 post on X that Solana phone sales have increased by over 10 times within the past 48 hours and are now projected to sell out before the new year. Gokal stated: Just so everyone is aware, Solana mobile saga sales have >10x’d in the past 48 hours, and are now on track to sell out before the new year. Moreover, Richard Wu, co-founder of Tensor, Solana’s non-fungible token marketplace, expressed his astonishment, stating: “This is crazy. BONK saved Solana on Christmas 2022. BONK is saving the Solana Saga Phone on Christmas 2023.” Wu emphasized that, unlike other dog coins, Bonk has emerged as the savior of Solana, a battle-tested high-throughput Layer 1 blockchain. He further added, “It’s not just a meme anymore. This is religion.” BONK Memecoin’s Impressive Surge Paired With Solana’s Growth Based on the 1-hour chart for BONK, the memecoin has consistently reached new highs since the start of the current bull run on November 8. Notably, the token has surpassed significant moving averages, including the 200-day and 50-day MA. This is a positive indicator of the token’s potential, as there are currently no visible resistance levels unless a correction occurs. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Says Cardano Will Rise To $32 As Most Valuable Altcoin In The Bull Run, Here’s Why It is worth noting that SOL has experienced a remarkable 443% uptrend year-to-date, along with significant ecosystem growth in recent months. This, combined with the ongoing memecoin frenzy, suggests that there may be no limits or boundaries for BONK’s upward trajectory. Following the announcement of Binance’s listing, the token experienced a surge of 121%, which has been further complemented by gains observed in the past 24 hours. However, BONK’s current price stands at $0.00002888, representing a shortfall of over 30% from its recent highs. The extent of BONK’s potential and the future patterns it will exhibit in its various time frames remain to be seen. These developments will provide further insights into the token’s future growth potential or possible corrections. However, the overall outlook for BONK appears promising for investors.

42409195,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEacf,1702675649,"Polygon Stops Work on 'Edge,' Used to Build Dogechain, as Focus Turns to ZK","Polygon Labs is deprecating support for Polygon Edge, a blockchain template that predates the project's shift toward zero-knowledge cryptography as a core technology.  Dogechain, which was never officially endorsed by leaders of the Dogecoin project, used Polygon Edge to build their new network, which accepts Dogecoin's DOGE to pay for transactions, known as gas fees.  Polygon Labs, the primary developer behind the Polygon blockchain ecosystem, said it has discontinued contributions to Polygon Edge, the open-source software for building Ethereum-compatible networks that was used as the template for Dogechain – created purportedly to bring DeFi to the Dogecoin community.  In a blog post, the developer said that its support for chain development in the Polygon ecosystem has shifted toward the new Polygon CDK, which is a framework for building layer-2 blockchains powered by zero-knowledge cryptography. Also known as ""ZK,"" the technology has become a core feature of many new projects and upgrades emanating from the crypto industry.  Top executives at Polygon Labs have been signaling that shift toward ZK since early this year. A new Ethereum-compatible, zero-knowledge-powered network called Polygon zkEVM launched in March, and subsequently the team has been recruiting blockchain builders to use ""Polygon CDK,"" a blueprint for new layer-2 networks that can be modeled after the original technology.  ""The landscape in which Edge was developed has changed and Polygon Labs now supports a solution that empowers developers to build within a (future) unified ecosystem of ZK-powered L2s,"" the blog post reads.  Several projects including Immutable, Astar, Canto, Gnosis Pay and Manta Network already have committed to using Polygon CDK. The team is actively competing to land the Celo blockchain's migration to a layer 2 as well as, according to people familiar with the matter, a new layer-2 network for the crypto exchange Kraken.  Dogechain, Dogecoin and DOGE  Dogechain was started last year by developers claiming an affinity with the Dogecoin community (although there is no official tie between Dogecoin and its DOGE meme coin, and Dogechain), and they chose Polygon Edge as the open-source software template for the project.  It was pitched as a way of adding support for Ethereum-style smart contracts, which in turn could facilitate new DeFi protocols as well as NFTs; the original Dogecoin blockchain lacked smart-contract support, since it was a fork of Litecoin, which in turn was an early clone of Bitcoin, the original blockchain launched in 2009 – several years before Ethereum came along, ushering in the new era of smart contracts.  Dogecoin's DOGE tokens could be used to pay for transactions on Dogechain, known as ""gas fees.""  The Dogechain whitepaper, published in June 2022, mentions Polygon Edge 22 times.  ""Polygon Edge employs a modular and extensible framework for creating EVM-compatible blockchain networks, sidechains, and global scaling solutions,"" the white paper reads. ""After all, Polygon Edge is primarily used to launch new blockchain networks that are fully compatible with Ethereum smart contracts and transactions.""  Notably, though, the Dogechain effort did not appear to have the endorsement of top leaders of the Dogecoin community. At the time of Dogechain's launch, Jens Wiechers, executive board member of the Dogecoin Foundation, tweeted that the Foundation had no affiliation with the Dogechain project. The founders of Dogecoin do not have any ties to Dogechain either.  It's not clear if or how Dogechain's operations or roadmap might change as a result of Polygon's decision. A request for comment sent through the Dogechain website wasn't immediately returned, and there was no immediate reply to a query posted to the project's official Discord channel. .  Friday's blog post from Polygon Labs did say: ""While a variety of projects began building with Polygon Edge, many will choose to migrate to Polygon CDK, with the option to, eventually, plug into the unified CDK ecosystem.""",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | ETH | MATIC | ZK,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/15/polygon-stops-work-on-edge-used-to-build-dogechain-as-focus-turns-to-zk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac62b6355bc79fe10527046707255f903b2969b8-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21434508,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565545,1702674017,Top 3 Meme Coins Under $50M Market Cap That Could Make You A millionaire Like BONK,"Solana-based BONK has emerged as one of the best performers over the past week even after meme coins put on a good show for investors. However, given that the meme coin has since crossed the $1 billion market cap threshold, some will argue that the potential to make a lot of profit has diminished already, leading to a hunt for other meme coins that could end up putting on a similar rally. So here are the top 3 meme coins under a $50 million market cap that could see a lot of upside in the right conditions. Doge Killer (LEASH) Tops List Of High Potential Meme Coins The Doge Killer (LEASH) coin is the brainchild of the Shiba Inu team which made its name as the OG ‘Dogecoin killer’. As the Shiba Inu ecosystem expanded, so did the potential, and a number of tokens have since made their way out from the team, including BONE and LEASH. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano (ADA) Price Will Rise 1700% To $11, Gives Reasons Why However, while Shiba Inu and BONE have since crossed the $200 million market cap mark, LEASH remains the lowest-rated SHIB ecosystem token in terms of market cap. Putting it in contrast with the performance of its predecessors, the LEASH token shows a lot of promise, especially in a bull market. It is one of the most popular meme coins still under a $50 million market cap, meaning that there could be at least a 10x increase expected from here. This makes LEASH a good opportunity for investors looking for smaller cap meme coins. Wojak (WOJAK) Meme Coin Rides PEPE Hype Wojak (WOJAK) was one of the many meme coins that made their way out of the woodwork following the PEPE pump earlier in the year. But unlike many others, WOJAK has persevered after securing multiple centralized exchange listings. Following the decline in the meme coin prices over the last few months, the WOJAK market cap fell drastically. Currently, it is sitting at a $23 million market cap, while PEPE’s market cap is still over $400 million. In the event of a PEPE rally, the chances of WOJAK making a run for it are high. So there could be a 10x opportunity with this coin. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply Turns Deflationary Post-Merge, Here’s How Much ETH Has Left Circulation Solana-Based Myro (MYRO) Enters The Scene Following the success of BONK, Solana-based meme coins have been making a killing in the market, but none have seen more success than Myro. The Myro meme coin previously rallied to a $50 million market cap. However, it has since corrected and is trading at just $35 million at the time of this writing. If the Solana ecosystem outperformance continues, Myro could follow in the footsteps of BONK as more money flows into the ecosystem. Reaching even a $400 million market cap would mean more than 10x its current price, making it a good meme coin to keep an eye on as the market develops.

42409207,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcEbD2,1702673067,"Bitcoin at Risk of Snapping Historic Winning Streak, but 'Perfect Storm' Brews for a Strong 2024","Bitcoin's price cooled at $41,800, down 4% this week and on track to snap the first eight-week streak of gains since 2017.  Investors moved a net $860 million of BTC to exchanges, signaling profit-taking, IntoTheBlock noted.  BTC to hit $75,000 early 2024 as U.S. spot bitcoin ETF approval and halving narratives combine, WOO Network predicted.  Bitcoin's [BTC] rally stalled, putting it on track to snap a historic eight-week streak of gains as its price remained muted at around $42,000 as of Friday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market cap recovered to $43,000 after Monday's 10% flash crash to $40,000 that flushed overenthusiastic leveraged bets on higher prices. A dovish Federal Reserve projecting rate cuts and the falling U.S. dollar bolstered the recovery, but lost steam by Friday and BTC slipped back to $41,500.  On-chain data indicates significant profit-taking behind the stalling prices. Bitcoin saw $860 million of net inflows into crypto exchanges during the week, the highest level since March, analytics firm IntoTheBlock noted Friday. Moving assets to exchanges usually signals an intention to sell, indicating that many investors decided to take some profits after bitcoin's 65% rally from $27,000 in October.  If BTC were to finish the week below $43,800, it would end an eight-week streak of gains, the longest winning streak since April to June 2017, according to TradingView historical data.  BTC was changing hands at around $42,000 at press time, down almost 4% since the start of the week.  Experts predict BTC all-time high prices for next year  The recent dip in price is likely just a blip on the radar, as bitcoin is primed for a strong 2024 with multiple investment narratives supporting rising prices, experts argued.  ""I do think this kind of trading is normal,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in an interview with CoinDesk TV on Friday. ""If you look at other asset classes, things don't move in straight lines.""  Market participants expect interest rates to fall ""aggressively"" in the U.S., U.K. and Europe for the next couple of years, which is more beneficial for risky assets compared to the past 18 months of rising rates, Erlam explained. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting an all-time high this week underscored the improvement in investors' risk-appetite, he added.  ""To take a breather and define a new range can be seen as a healthy sign,"" Anthony Rousseau, head of brokerage solutions at TradeStation, said in an emailed note.  He said the Federal Reserve hinting at easing monetary policy and cutting rates next year injected a ""windfall of confidence"" in risk assets like crypto, but the more prevalent theme is still an increasingly anticipated U.S. regulatory approval for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by BlackRock and others, and the fresh demand for BTC they would unleash.  Meanwhile, long-term holders – or HODLers, who hold on to their assets for at least a year without moving – haven't started selling despite the short-term profit-taking, Rousseau noted, making bitcoin's supply increasingly restricted.  ""It’s possible we have the perfect storm brewing for a strong 2024, with the possibility of closing in on all-time highs by the end of 2024,” he said.  All-time highs could come even sooner, crypto trading platform WOO Network predicted, as spot ETF listings and bitcoin's upcoming halving in April, which will slash new BTC issuance by half, may create an enticing narrative combination.  ""We targeted $75k for BTC in early 2024 and believe demand will increase heavily as the ETF and halving narratives combine, leading BTC to develop an additional narrative as a safe haven asset,"" WOO Network's year-end report said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | WOO,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | WOO,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/15/bitcoin-at-risk-of-snapping-historic-winning-streak-but-perfect-storm-brews-for-a-strong-2024,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/988f937a0e3679d1fc8c5a86eeb1cd4b5bdad392-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

To the extent that federal watchdogs — like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) — enforce the law acting with executive authority, mostly adhere to legislation written by congressional lawmakers, and are kept in check by the court system, it’s reasonable to say some degree of autonomy is warranted.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But when it comes to potentially novel technology and business practices, regulatory self-determination can impede a new and emerging industry’s ability to advance. Crypto proponents, for instance, think distributed, self-executing ledgers are disruptive enough (in a good way) to warrant bespoke rules. It’s old news that SEC Chair Gary Gensler disagrees.  Gensler has said repeatedly that 99.99999999% of crypto tokens are securities — his domain — and that the supposed innovations of blockchain are just new ways of doing old things. And so, Gensler has been applying existing rules and regulations to rein in an industry that has become a hotbed for fraud as well as financial experimentation.  Today is no different. In a new filing in the SEC’s ongoing legal imbroglio with Coinbase, the executive agency reaffirmed its stance that it has the “discretion to determine the timing and priorities of its regulatory agenda.” Gensler, in a press release, added that the current law “appropriately governs crypto asset securities.”  This filing came in response to Coinbase’s petition to the SEC in 2022 for new “rulemaking” tailored to blockchain, which turned into a lawsuit, filed by the largest U.S. exchange in 2023 after it didn’t hear back from the agency. Coinbase had asked a U.S. judge to force the SEC’s hand to write new rules or at the very least respond to the exchange’s petition.  So is the SEC’s response adequate? The agency said Coinbase’s ask was “unworkable,” but really doesn’t elaborate. In a two-pager, the SEC pointed out that it has “broad discretion” to act (citing a 2007 Supreme Court case, Massachusetts v. EPA), that it “benefits from engagement with market participants” and that it “may undertake further consideration of issues raised in the Petition.”  However, the SEC did not say anything detailed to the question of why it considers cryptocurrencies to be securities, or Coinbase’s specific desire to create clear “disclosure requirements for offers and sales of crypto asset securities.”  The closest the agency got to something like this was when it brought up the fact it is engaged in “numerous” regulatory enforcement actions brought against crypto industry “participants.” (I guess those are “engagements” it “benefits” from, considering many crypto companies said they found Gensler’s “open door” closed?)  In fact, in a remarkable bit of circular reasoning, the SEC specifically notes that its view on cryptocurrency is informed by “data and information” gleaned from the legal “undertakings … the Commission is currently pursuing.” In other words: The SEC, which is pursuing securities charges against crypto firms, cannot consider changing the rules that uphold those legal actions, because of information it has learned pursuing those cases.  But what if those legal actions were never justified in the first place? This wouldn’t be the first time the SEC was self-referential in matters of law. In its recent lawsuit against Kraken, the SEC cited the fact the crypto exchange had listed tokens the agency previously called securities in its similar actions brought against Binance and Coinbase. However, so far, the SEC hasn’t truly determined, absolutely-matter-of-factly whether any token is a security.  See also: What New Yorkers Think of the SEC's War Against Crypto  “I know Gary says [the vast majority of tokens are securities], but so far that has not been the finding of most courts the SEC has been interacting with,” Columbia Business School professor and former Paxos fund manager Austen Campbell told CoinDesk in an interview.  Campbell noted Judge Torres’ decision in the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple that drew a clear distinction between the “investment contract” Ripple made with institutional buyers of XRP and the token itself, which was not found to be a security. This is to say nothing of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), which might limit the SEC’s “broad discretion” to act at all without Congress’s prior consent.  So does the SEC’s decision Friday matter? To be honest, it seems like more of the same: An agency that has some autonomy continuing to treat crypto the way it wants. It could be said in this Age of Vibes we live in — where meme coins top the charts, inflation is felt more than measured and when investment decisions are made on gut — that Gensler is the vibiest hypebeast of them all, making the call that tokens are securities not on the basis of sound logic, but because that is what he feels deep down.  When Coinbase asked for new rulemaking in 2022, its chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad wrote a detailed blog post noting that “securities rules simply do not work for digitally native instruments.” He cited things like tokenized debt and equity, utility tokens and non-fungible tokens.  It’s clear enough that crypto is used for investments, and so, there is likely a role for the SEC to play in overseeing the industry and helping keep investors safe. Coinbase’s petition was trying to figure out when and where that may be appropriate, and the SEC regretfully declined to engage at all.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/15/coinbase-tried-to-rein-in-a-renegade-sec-thats-trying-to-rein-in-a-renegade-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c502cf6222357b612a4ae6dd48038fd2c19d20cb-2048x1046.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

His observations, informed by a deep understanding of market dynamics, suggest that Bitcoin’s prolonged rally could soon give way to further correction. Altcoins Set To Shine As Bitcoin Undergoes Correction Pizzino’s analysis is grounded in a comprehensive review of various market indicators. The analyst has been closely monitoring the altcoin sector, noting an accumulation of upside potential which could lead to impactful market movements, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving in view. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Unshakable Bottom: Analyst Reveals The Price BTC Won’t Drop Below This anticipation of a shift in market sentiment is further supported by his examination of the US Dollar Index Futures chart, which shows a downward trend and recent significant drops in a single trading day. Pizzino interprets these movements as indicators of further downside, influenced by the general macroeconomic conditions. While Bitcoin braces for potential setbacks, Pizzino’s analysis reveals a silver lining for the broader cryptocurrency market, particularly altcoins. His study of the Total3 chart, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, shows a latent potential for growth in the altcoin sector. This observation aligns with the cyclic nature of the crypto market, characterized by alternating periods of fear and greed. According to Pizzino, the market is currently experiencing one of its lengthiest stretch of positive sentiment, a trend he expects to shift in alignment with historical market behaviors. Bitcoin’s Strong Support Zone And Emerging Altcoin Focus In parallel, another prominent crypto analyst, Ali Charts, has identified a critical support zone for Bitcoin.

In case of a deeper correction, #Bitcoin finds solid support between $37,150 and $38,360. This zone is backed by 1.52 million addresses holding 534,000 $BTC. Also, watch out for two resistance walls that could keep the #BTC uptrend at bay: one at $43,850 and another at $46,400. pic.twitter.com/NGm1XpMOLf — Ali (@ali_charts) December 11, 2023 This significant level of accumulation has established a strong foundation, potentially curtailing any further decline in Bitcoin’s value below that level.

However, a noticeable decline in Bitcoin’s daily trading volume, from $30 billion earlier this week to $13.6 billion, hints at a shift in investor focus towards the altcoin market.

Amid this recovery, DOGE miners have been selling off a significant portion of their holdings, which could explain the decline in the asset’s price earlier in the week. Dogecoin Miners Sell $25 Million Worth Of Tokens Dogecoin miners are some of the largest holders of DOGE with their holdings running into the billions. So any significant activity from them in one direction or the other can often be a major factor in where the price goes next. This time around, their activities have learned on the more bearish side and have negatively affected the DOGE price in the process. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Who Predicted Bitcoin 2023 Bull Run Releases New Target According to the on-chain crypto data tracking platform IntoTheBlock, Dogecoin miners have been selling into every pump in the last couple of weeks. On November 24, the total combined reserves of DOGE miners had climbed to 4.67 billion DOGE. However, by the second week of December, this figure has dropped by a few hundred million. Over the last month, the reserves have been on a slow decline, usually on a daily basis. But this decline adds up when zoomed out to look at the big picture. By December 12, Dogecoin miners held 4.4 billion DOGE in their balances, meaning they had sold over 240 million tokens in the space of three weeks. Taking an average price of DOGE over the last few weeks, the total amount of DOGE sold by these mines comes out to around $25 million. This figure would explain the mounting sell pressure that the altcoin had been acting which eventually led to a brief decline below $0.091. DOGE price wobbles amid uncertainty | Source: DOGEUSD On Tradingview.com DOGE Price Recovery In Trouble? After the dip earlier in the week, the Dogecoin price has begun to recover as of Thursday. This recovery pushed the price above $0.097 which is a welcome development for investors. But there is still the speculation of more sell pressure coming from DOGE miners. Related Reading: XRP Bull Run Confirmed: Largest Bull Flag In Crypto History Just Formed However, there seems to be a change in sentiment among these miners whose holdings have begun to rise once more. Between, December 12 and 13, their holdings went from 4.4 billion to 4.41 billion. A small recovery, but a welcome change. Dogecoin miner net flows are also starting to turn positive after two days of negative net flows totaling over 80 million DOGE. Net flows in this case is the difference between the total amount of inflows and the total amount of outflows from the miners’ wallets. On December 13, the miner’s net flow was 7.09 million DOGE. Still low but a stark contrast to the -43.33 million recorded on December 12.

42419025,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDGG5,1702659041,Taiwanese Authorities Investigating Blockchain Betters over Polymarket Election Contract: Report,"Those looking to make a quick buck betting on Taiwan's upcoming election may want to think twice, as local law enforcement is currently investigating online influencers and community members promoting a Polymarket contract about the nation's upcoming election.  Taiwan-based BlockTempo reported that multiple influencers and individuals in the crypto community have been subpoenaed for their participation in Polymarket contracts that let users bet on the outcome of the January election.  There's currently over $300,000 bet on a contract regarding the outcome of the election, with the market giving the Democratic Progressive Party's Lai Ching-te, also known as William Lai, a 78% chance of winning.  Betting on the outcome of an election is specifically prohibited under Article 88-1 of Taiwan's Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act.  ""A person who gambles in a public place or a place open to the public on the outcome of an election or recall shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than six months, short-term detention or a fine of not more than NT$100,000 ($3,196.85),"" the law reads.  ""Law enforcement agencies in Taiwan are vigilant in investigating any gambling activities related to presidential elections,"" Sherman Lin, an attorney at Taipei-based Lin & Partners told CoinDesk in an interview. ""Broad legal interpretations have been applied to gambling crimes under the Presidential Election and Recall Act, leading to investigations and convictions of gambling website operators in Taiwan targeting Taiwanese gamblers.""  In the U.S., gambling on the outcomes of elections is illegal in most states, including Nevada. However, most of the enforcement is done by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  Polymarket's Terms of Use prohibit it from being used by U.S. persons.  Prediction market KalshiEX has sued the CFTC over its decision to ban its proposed derivatives contracts for betting on congressional control, arguing that these contracts are lawful and beneficial for public interest by enabling risk hedging and providing predictive data.  In Taiwan, while gambling activities, including participation in, promotion of, and platform hosting for betting pools like Polymarket, face legal consequences, enforcing actions against overseas entities presents jurisdictional challenges, limiting Taiwan's legal reach primarily to domestic actors, Lin explained.  ""Given Polymarket’s decentralized nature and lack of physical presence in Taiwan, the Taiwanese judicial system's reach over Polymarket might be limited,"" he said, explaining that law enforcement would likely target online influencers that promoted the contract.  ""There have been recent cases where Taiwanese prosecutors pursued [online influencers] involved in promoting trading platforms, suggesting that even promotional activities could lead to legal implications,"" he continued.  When the unlicensed crypto exchange JPEX collapsed in Hong Kong, local law enforcement arrested a number of online influencers who promoted the platform.  Lin also said that while there is plenty of legal precedent to go after centralized entities organizing election gambling, there's ""no established legal precedent in Taiwan for decentralized platforms organizing election betting.""

Arbitrum's sequencer stalled ""during a significant surge in network traffic,"" according to posts across the network's social media on Friday. ""We are working to resolve as quickly as possible and will provide a post-mortem as soon as possible,"" read a post on Arbitrum's status webpage.  Sequencers have been likened to an ""air traffic control"" for deciding which transactions land first on layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum. They're an essential link between the L2 and and the base chain, Ethereum. But they're also a single point of failure.  The outage spawned chaos and confusion in the Arbitrum community. A previously scheduled 12 p.m. ET (17:00 UTC) ""ask me anything"" Twitter Spaces was abruptly canceled by an Arbitrum employee shortly after it began. The Arbitrum Discord piled high with messages from traders fearful of what would happen to their positions when the network came back online.  Arbitrum's sequencer last stalled out in June after a bug created a backlog of unprocessed transactions. That issue was patched in a matter of hours.

Bitcoin And Ethereum Options Contract Set To Expire Global options trading service platform Greeks.live, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share data regarding the expiration of the crypto assets. According to the platform, about 37,000 BTC options with a notional value of $1.58 billion are set to expire. In addition, Bitcoin’s current put-call ratio stands at 1.02 with a “Maxpain” point of $42,000. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Have Spiked as Bitcoin ETF Token Also Rises Meanwhile, for Ethereum, the data shows that about 268,000 options valued at $610 million are set to expire soon. In addition, the current put-call ratio for ETH stand at 0.66, with a “maxpain” point of $2,250. The post read: Dec. 15 Options Data. 37,000 BTC options are about to expire with a Put Call Ratio of 1.02, a Maxpain point of $42,000, and a notional value of $1.58 billion. 268,000 ETH options are due to expire with a Put Call Ratio of 0.66, a Maxpain point of $2,250, and a notional value of $610 million. Notably, the put-call ratio, to put it simply, contrasts the trading volume of put and call options. A ratio higher than 1 signifies a higher number of puts (sell) than calls (buy) options, implying a negative outlook among traders. Furthermore, the price at which the highest number of options would expire worthless is known as the maximum pain (Maxpain) point. Greeks.live asserted that this week saw a decline in the market, with BTC dropping close to $40,000 at one point. As a result, many hedge their positions, which led to a greater proportion of Put than Call positions this week. The bulk of trading is still concentrated on Bitcoin options even with the decline. The platform also highlighted that the Implied Volatility (IV) has remained quite flat for about a month now. In addition, significant option moves are still going on. The Crypto Assets Set To See Substantial Inflow Cryptocurrency analyst Ali has recently revealed that billions of inflow are set to be poured into Bitcoin and Ethereum. The analyst shared this crucial information with the crypto community in an X post on Thursday, December 14. According to Ali, over $19.7 billion is about to flow into the two major players in the cryptocurrency market. He also added that this capital inflow is comparable to what we observed in December 2020. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Fees Rise By Over 50%: Will BTC Conquer $69k?

42419008,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDG0b,1702653153,U.S. SEC Denies Coinbase's Push for Crypto Regulations as 'Unwarranted',"Coinbase has waited since 2022 for a response from the Securities and Exchange Commission on its formal petition to request tailored regulations for crypto, even seeking to force an answer through the courts, and the rejection has now arrived.  The SEC says there's no reason to craft a new regime for crypto, and that it's already writing some targeted crypto rules and conducting enforcement actions under existing authorities, though two of the five commissioners disagreed.  Coinbase said it'll take the matter back to court.  U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase's petition to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prod it toward a system of tailored rules for digital assets was rejected by the regulator on Friday.  ""The existing securities regime appropriately governs crypto asset securities,"" said Chair Gary Gensler, in a statement issued with the denial. Besides arguing that the SEC has sufficient authority in today's laws, he said the industry watchdog has already been engaging in rule proposals to directly regulate crypto businesses, and its enforcement division has also been able to address wrongdoing.  Gensler made a third argument, too, that ""it is important to maintain commission discretion in setting its own rulemaking priorities.""  Coinbase had applied this formal pressure in 2022, before it was itself sued by the SEC as an unregistered securities exchange. Earlier this year, the company had asked a federal court to force a response from the agency, which has now arrived.  ""The commission disagrees with the petition’s assertion that application of existing securities statutes and regulations to crypto asset securities, issuers of those securities, and intermediaries in the trading, settlement, and custody of those securities is unworkable,"" the five-member commission concluded in its two-page response, which said the agency had given the request careful consideration. ""The commission concludes that the requested rulemaking is currently unwarranted and denies the petition.""  Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said the company will further challenge this rejection in court, calling the SEC's decision an ""abdication of its duty.""  ""No one looking fairly at our industry thinks the law is clear or that there isn’t more work to do,"" Grewal said in a statement.  Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda opposed the SEC's denial.  ""We hope that interested persons continue to posit specific rule changes, guidance, and exemptions that would form a useful basis for the crypto industry to continue its development within the United States,"" the Republican commissioners argued in a statement. ""While we are disappointed that the commission is not hosting these important conversations, we will have an open ear for conversations that others host and the ideas that emerge from those conversations.""  Grewal said that Coinbase is ""grateful that two commissioners disagreed with the denial and called for real dialogue.""  ""We should be working together to create laws and rules that will benefit consumers and US innovation, not defending lawsuits based on legal positions that change month after month,"" he said.  A footnote in Gensler's statement argues that Coinbase's own petition repeatedly refers to ""digital asset securities"" and the SEC's authority over them, ""thus acknowledging that crypto assets can be offered and sold as securities and subject to oversight by the SEC.""  Gensler had also noted – without naming Prometheum Inc. – that a crypto broker has used a special digital assets registration, suggesting this method of compliance is ""workable.""  Seeking a wider, industry-specific system of regulations in the U.S. has been the leading priority of crypto lobbyists in Washington. So far, legislative efforts this year in Congress have made progress but failed to reach the finish line. While the SEC pushes back on the need for tailored rules on the securities side, the wider Financial Stability Oversight Council that includes the agency's chairman as a member concluded in its annual report yesterday that crypto does need Congress to intervene with regulations.

In his scenario, ADA could hit this price level if Bitcoin were to achieve a $10 trillion market cap, as he projects that this would put ADA’s own at $400 billion. Meanwhile, he believes that ADA’s dominance could rise to as high as 4% in that period. For his more conservative prediction, he foresees ADA hitting at least $16 in the next bull cycle. Based on his hypothetical scenario, this would happen if Bitcoin were to hit a market cap of $5 trillion, as this would put ADA’s own market cap at $200 billion. The crypto expert also referred to the charts to show why he is so bullish on ADA. He noted that ADA is already performing better based on historical patterns, as he alluded to 2017 in particular. In the relatively short term, Crypto Crow sees ADA hitting $10 by August 2024, as he highlighted the Bitcoin Halving as a major factor in this regard. ADA trending at $0.63 | Source: ADAUSD On Tradingview.com Cardano’s DeFi Landscape Could Be The Trigger Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, had previously highlighted how Cardano’s growing DeFi landscape important was. He noted that it would be one of the factors that would propel ADA’s price to significant heights in the next bull run. This is a real possibility, as Cardano has seen impressive growth in this regard. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply Turns Deflationary Post-Merge, Here’s How Much ETH Has Left Circulation Data from DeFiLlama shows that the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the network has been on a steady rise since the beginning of the year. It recently hit an all-time high (ATH) of $444 million. At the time of writing, the TVL on the network stands at just over $429 million. Crypto analyst Psyclops also factored this into mind when he recently suggested that ADA could rise to as high as $10. He highlighted the fact the network undoubtedly has more utility than when the last bull run occurred. One of these use cases, which he alluded to, is the “massive DeFi” that Cardano now has.

Sam Bankman-Fried, the boss of FTX, which suddenly spiraled into bankruptcy last year, had championed the Solana project, and the exchange holds a sizable clutch of 55.8 million SOL tokens, according to CoinGecko.  Those SOL holdings, the majority of which (42.2 million) are locked up and not immediately tradable on the market, had been pegged at a market value of $1.16 billion earlier this year. The tokens are worth around $4.2 billion, based on the SOL price of $75.60 on Friday.

42419021,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDGCz,1702648175,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Ends the Week in Muted Mood,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Following a surge to 20-month highs last week, bitcoin appears to have settled into a new range, trading between $42,000 and just over $43,000 for much of this week. The largest cryptocurrency is currently priced at around $42,600, down 0.65% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which offers a weighted view of the digital asset market at large, is down a similar amount. With a large degree of spot BTC ETF enthusiasm already priced into asset prices and with no decision on the approval of applications to list such a fund by the SEC expected until the new year, the crypto market is showing signs of ticking along sideways for the remainder of 2023.  Sales of Solana's smartphone are surging thanks to an airdrop of 30 million BONK tokens available to owners of the previously struggling Saga phone. ""Saga sales have >10x'd in the past 48 hours, and are now on track to sell out before the new year,"" Solana co-founder Raj Gokal tweeted Thursday. The surge is so pronounced that Gokal's counterpart, Anatoly Yakovenko, tweeted they needed to raise the price. BONK, Solana's equivalent of dog-themed meme coin dogecoin, can seemingly take the credit for the turnaround in Saga's fortunes, with users saying on the Discord servers that they had just bought the phone to take advantage of the airdrop.  Crypto custody firm Qredo's crypto exchange Ankex has closed its doors. CEO Michael Moro, formerly of Genesis Trading, has already moved on. Ankex sought to combine a non-custodial DeFi approach with elements familiar to professional traders such as a central limit order book, earlier this year, but its ""development has been paused,"" the exchange said in a message to its community. ""As some of you tested earlier this year, Ankex was ready for a public beta launch. Unfortunately, our path must pause at this stage."" Ankex may have just been a victim of unfortunate timing as the crypto industry gradually emerges from a prolonged bear market  Trending Posts  What We Know About the Massive Ledger Hack  'Bitcoin NFT' Hysteria Comes to Sotheby's as Super-Mario-Style Mushroom Character Tops $200K  Crypto-Friendly Does Not Mean Crypto-Easy",NEUTRAL,BTC | BONK,BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BONK,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/15/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-ends-the-week-in-muted-mood,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac875e125bbc8520babdba645bc19ff758607243-781x453.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Following its launch, Bonk acquired popularity within the Solana ecosystem by acting as a payment method for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and discovering a variety of applications. This Meme Coin Is No Joke Since October, the coin has grown rapidly despite its initial debut as a parody token due to the high level of interest in the Solana ecosystem. With 61 trillion BONK in circulation, the coin’s market capitalization is currently $931,186 indicating a significant 66.60% price gain over the last seven days. BONKUSD currently trading at $0.0000261942 territory.

As part of his predictions, he highlighted the best and worst-case scenarios for the flagship cryptocurrency going forward. Bitcoin Could Ride To $60,000 In a live stream on his TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel, crypto analyst DonAlt noted that Bitcoin could rise to the resistance level of $60,000 based on historical patterns. The analyst had highlighted a bullish setup on the quarter timeframe, which had occurred both in 2018 and 2021. He also mentioned that the current quarterly is strikingly similar to those periods. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply Turns Deflationary Post-Merge, Here’s How Much ETH Has Left Circulation The analyst believes that the road to $60,000 would be fuelled by the Spot Bitcoin ETF rumors (as has been the case so far) before an approval possibly comes in January. However, it is not all good news from the $60,000 price level, as DonAlt believes that the approval will be a ‘sell-the-news’ event. If that were to be the case, he predicts that Bitcoin will drop to $35,000 before it trends upward afterward. He also provided a bearish side to the quarterly timeframe setup as he suggested that this is more likely to happen as it is more “accurate.” For the bearish setup, he projects a close below the resistance level of $35,000. He stated that this would suggest a bearish restest and that investors could expect lower prices as a result of this. BTC price looks to retest $43,000 | Source: BTCUSD On Tradingview.com Why An ETF Approval Will Be A ‘Sell-The-News’ Event DonAlt further elaborated on his stance of a possible Spot Bitcoin ETF approval in January being a ‘sell-the-news’ event. He explained that the reason for this belief is because Bitcoin has ridden high (up about 3x from the bottom) on the back of these rumors. As such, this would naturally suggest that it is already priced in. He further noted that he would have had a different opinion if Bitcoin had, for example, traded at around $25,000 and then an approval came. He believes that would have been an easy trade as the flagship cryptocurrency will undoubtedly fly high on the back of such development. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Cardano (ADA) Price Will Rise 1700% To $11, Gives Reasons Why Renowned Economist Peter Schiff shares similar sentiments as he once noted how Bitcoin has rallied significantly on the back of the ETF rumor. According to him, there will be no more “good news” to spark a Bitcoin rally once the pending Spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved. However, trading firm QCP Capital recently highlighted what could prevent this from happening. The firm stated that a significant amount of inflows into these ETFs in the first few weeks of trading could prevent the classic sell-the-news event from happening. If these funds see enough liquidity, they project that Bitcoin could hit its all-time high (ATH) of $69,000 instead.

More Pain To Come At These Levels LUNC’s current price is standing above $0.00017491. As it currently stands, the token is at a crucial price point as any movement here can make or break future price movements. Investors and traders should exercise caution in the next couple of days as the market slows down and assets return to a more stable price point.

The U.K. government wants to be a crypto hub but has said little about how it plans to regulate the blockchain industry.  U.K. Member of Parliament Natalie Elphicke called for the government to do more for blockchain on Thursday at an event conducted in the Thames Pavilion which resides in the House of Commons where lawmakers meet.  “Now, I want to see the U.K. doing more to harness the power of blockchain technologies, to be that leader, to mark that step change because it's vital that industry and policymakers work together to advance understanding and the application of the technologies,” Elphicke said at an event in London hosted by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Blockchain Technologies she chairs. The blockchain APPG is a cross party group, similar to the crypto APPG.  Blockchain is a sector that Elphicke said she sees a lot of potential in. She said it could provide increased transparency in global supply chains or be used for digital identity and data purposes.  Other countries have been taking on legislation addressing blockchain technology issues. The Deploying American Blockchains Act, a blockchain-friendly bill, received unanimous approval in a committee in the U.S. House of Representatives this month. Meanwhile, Belgium’s government announced last month it wants to boost European blockchain infrastructure.  The U.K. needs to match the pace that international regulators are taking to move forward, Elphicke said. She also called for the U.K. to collaborate with other countries on blockchain issues.  The U.K. has done little in terms of blockchain policy but has said it wants to be a crypto hub – a view the U.K.'s new economic secretary, Bim Afolami, reiterated recently. The country is planning on regulating the sector in phases, starting with legislation for stablecoins being introduced early next year. It’s not clear when more blockchain policies may be enacted in the U.K., though a bill that paves a way for blockchain technology to be used for transporting trade documents recently passed in the country.  The blockchain APPG group also plans to launch round table discussions next year, as well as ask the industry to weigh in on how the U.K. can harness skills, opportunities and diversity in blockchain, Elphicke told CoinDesk at the event.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/15/lawmaker-calls-for-the-uk-government-to-do-more-for-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af3ffb650518f5777e62c80dbb966b8fd540fecb-3000x2250.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC was able to clear the $42,000 resistance zone to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the $43,000 zone. However, the price seems to be struggling near the $43,350 zone. A high was formed near $43,421 and the price is now consolidating gains.

21395788,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565462,1702602047,DeFi Researcher Questions Injective Protocol’s Appeal: Is INJ Overvalued?,"Thor Hartvigsen, a data-driven decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher, is questioning the appeal of Injective Protocol, a layer-1 platform whose creators say is designed to expressly power finance. As of December 2023, INJ, the native currency of Injective Protocol, is one of the top-performing coins, surpassing Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Is Injective Protocol Undervalued Based On On-Chain Metrics? Taking to X on December 14, Hartvigsen highlighted the platform’s relatively low total value locked (TVL) of $11 million and the limited number of protocols launched on the platform, currently standing at seven. Based on the researcher’s analysis, the largest dapp on the layer-1, Helix Protocol, a decentralized exchange (DEX), only manages a daily trading volume of about $7.4 million. Hartvigsen states this is significantly lower than other perpetual futures protocols, including the Perpetual Protocol. These competitors, the analyst notes, are valued at around $200 and $300 million based on fully diluted valuation (FDV). So far, looking at data, there are only seven active protocols on Injective, with Helix managing over 60% of the ecosystem’s TVL, reinforcing its dominance. Related Reading: SHIB Roars As Shibarium Hits 100 Million Transactions – Big Things Unfolding If on-chain activity and the number of active protocol leads, Hartvigsen wants answers to irrefutably justify Injective Protocol’s $3.2 billion valuation. The researcher compares Injective with other blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana. These platforms command relatively higher trading volume and on-chain activity. To illustrate, Hartvigsen cites DefiLlama data, which shows that Injective’s volume ranges from $5 to $7 million daily from seven dapps. On the other hand, Solana, a competing layer-1, presently processes between $500 and $700 million. Meanwhile, Injective Protocol cannot match Ethereum, which processes over $1 billion in trading volume. INJ Up 395%, Will Prices Continue Rising On Investor Optimism? In response to Hartvigsen’s analysis, yiggit, a user claiming to be a legal counsel, defended Injective Protocol. The user emphasized that TVL, as the researcher cited, cannot be the sole determinant to gauge a project’s potential. Related Reading: Bitcoin Deja Vu: Capital Inflows Mirror Pre-2021 Bull Run Momentum Yiggit added that Injective Protocol’s potential is rooted in the expected number of upcoming apps. Notably, the legal counsel notes that optimism also stems from the Injective Protocol’s origins in Cosmos. In the Cosmos ecosystem, staking tends to catalyze participation as users seek to receive airdrops. Still, whether or not the researcher’s assessment is valid depends on time. So far, looking at the INJ price action in the daily chart, the coin has been charting higher, registering new all-time highs. To illustrate, INJ is up 395% from mid-October 2023, rallying as the broader crypto market recovers. At this valuation, CoinMarketCap data shows that the project has a market cap of over $2.7 billion.

21393740,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565457,1702598416,"Matrixport Predicts Bitcoin 2024 Surge, Regardless Of Spot ETF Approval – Here’s Why","As the final months of the year approach, the anticipation surrounding the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has generated considerable excitement among analysts and traders. While many stake their hopes on these index funds to fuel a significant price surge for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, Matrixport, a digital assets financial services platform, offers a distinct perspective. According to their latest report, Matrixport firmly believes that Bitcoin and crypto prices are destined to soar in 2024, irrespective of the SEC’s decision on ETF approval. Federal Reserve’s Rate Cuts As Catalyst? One influential factor identified by Matrixport is the recent declaration of victory by Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve (Fed), in the institution’s fight against inflation. Powell’s mention of possible rate cuts caught the attention of the digital asset platform, which noted in its report that Bitcoin prices jumped nearly 300% in 2019 when the Fed ended its hiking cycle and kept rates on hold for an extended period. Matrixport draws parallels to the present scenario, where the Fed projects three cuts, equivalent to 75 basis points, in 2024.

Potential Decrease In CPI Strengthens BTC’s Role As Inflation Hedge Matrixport’s proprietary inflation model also indicates the possibility of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) dipping below 2% by the end of 2024. This prediction holds significant implications for Bitcoin’s price and its role as a potential hedge against inflation. The CPI serves as a key measure of inflation, reflecting changes in the average prices of a basket of goods and services over time. A dip below 2% suggests a deceleration in the rate of price increases, potentially indicating a more subdued inflationary environment. In such a scenario, investors might seek alternative assets such as BTC that can preserve their purchasing power and shield them from the erosion of value caused by inflation. SEC’s Bitcoin ETF Decision Irrelevant? Importantly, Matrixport emphasizes that even if the SEC maintains its disapproval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January 2024, higher crypto prices are still expected throughout the year. Furthermore, the report highlights the substantial growth of assets in US money market funds, which have doubled since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching a staggering $6.1 trillion. This growth implies an additional $320 billion in interest rate payments per year, creating a potential influx of $370 billion annually or roughly $1 billion daily into risk assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. Matrixport’s bullish outlook for 2024 also takes into account significant events on the horizon. The year marks a Bitcoin halving cycle, historically associated with substantial price increases averaging 192%.

Matrixport suggests that his policies could potentially bolster the US economy, thereby driving up stock prices and cryptocurrencies. As of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is currently trading at $42,600, up 1.8% in the past 24 hours.
