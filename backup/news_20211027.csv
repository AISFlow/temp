The volumes were expected to go up once the digital asset had hit a new all-time high in October. However, this was not the case. Previous trends have often pointed to exchange balances seeing an increase in bull markets when investors moved their holdings to exchanges in order to take profits. This bull market has defied all expectations for it and continues to do so. Outflows from exchanges outpace inflows as investors withdraw BTC from exchanges en masse. Exchange balance volumes relative to the circulating supply of bitcoin have declined towards three-year lows. BTC exchange balances now sit at levels not seen since January 2018.

42394386,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvckRl,1635371122,A Need for More Regulatory Clarity,"For years fintech leaders, investors and technologists in the cryptocurrency space have whined about the lack of regulatory clarity coming from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  It was only in February 2020, amended in April of this year, that SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce proposed her forward-thinking safe harbor rules providing a three-year grace period from prosecution related to securities registration and a regulatory sandbox to develop decentralized networks. Meanwhile, the SEC charged alleged violators of the Securities Act of 1933 as disparate as Ripple Labs, BitConnect, actor Steven Seagal, political lobbyist Jack Abramoff and legendary innovator and outlaw John McAfee.  Such securities law enforcement is proliferating. According to Cornerstone Research, the SEC brought 75 enforcement actions and 19 trading suspensions against companies and individuals in the crypto industry between July 2013 and December 2020.  James Cooper, a CoinDesk columnist, is a professor of law at California Western School of Law in San Diego.  After taking the helm at the SEC, Gary Gensler unsurprisingly announced there was not enough protection for crypto investors. A few weeks later, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) warned that cryptocurrency services were “spinning straw into gold” and that the United States’ financial stability was at risk without strict regulation. Last week, Democrat U.S. senators called for Facebook to refrain from launching its Novi crypto wallet because the company “cannot be trusted to manage a payment system or digital currency.”  Now, it is essential that we all get clear, specific direction on what is and what is not permissible. After years of hemming and hawing, our legislators must determine whether crypto is a security, a utility, a commodity, a currency or the latest tulip mania.  They must act, on the one hand, to ensure that the United States is a leader, if not the leader, in this new area of capital formation and financial technology. But on the other hand, they must also protect small-time investors and the general public from fraudsters, pump and dumpsters and the vagaries of exploding asset bubbles.  The current geopolitical situation also necessitates regulatory clarity. The Chinese government has banned bitcoin mining, forcing a huge migration of ASIC computers out of the country and providing a great opportunity for the U.S. to dominate mining. The Chinese are rolling out their Digital Currency/Electronic Payment initiative nationally in the coming year as the People’s Republic of China implements its sovereign-backed, central bank digital currency, long before the U.S. develops a digital dollar. Some sense of what the U.S. is planning for digital assets and a sovereign-backed digital currency would help incentivize a private industry response here.  There is worry that even much smaller players worldwide (Estonia, Malta or Singapore, for example) may have the first mover advantage in financial technology by being the most lenient jurisdiction for incorporation, funding and development. This race to the bottom is no way to run an industry, even a disruptive one.  But we should be careful what we ask for regarding regulation. Not all new rules will be beneficial. The pending Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act (still a bill at this point) provided the crypto space a little too much regulatory clarity: The new list of actors who are to be considered broker-dealers under U.S. securities laws include miners, programmers and node operators, and they all have reporting requirements to the Internal Revenue Service.  The goal is to raise $28 billion to help pay for new infrastructure in the United States over the coming years, but the pending legislation may create more problems than it solves for fintech, putting compliance requirements on many actors who did not have such duties before. Talk about a chilling effect.  Earlier this month, Coinbase provided the U.S. government with ideas about regulating the crypto space, a sign of maturity in the industry. The main contribution was the innovative call for a new federal agency to regulate digital asset markets. Notwithstanding, this may be viewed as a move toward regulatory capture – an economic theory positing that regulatory agencies may be dominated by the industries or interests they are charged with regulating.  The result would be an agency that acts to benefit existing firms in the industry it is charged to regulate rather than acts in the public interest. But Coinbase is, after all, reacting to the missing regulatory clarity.  A tangential issue is the revolving door between the U.S. government and the crypto industry – another predictable danger. Middle-level lawyers from the SEC, for example, are going to leading law firms to help crypto clients after stints in the regulator seat. Law enforcement leaders are joining digital asset firms, lending legitimacy and expertise to their burgeoning businesses.  This is all part of a maturation process that the digital asset industry requires. It cannot be worth $2.7 trillion without some attention from governments. That kind of attention can be unpredictable. And predictability is what we are all allegedly pining for.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,James Cooper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/27/a-need-for-more-regulatory-clarity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/619458d9f7a53600036d8cd5548e9061f659a830-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Wyoming has attempted to attract investment in recent years through establishing itself as a crypto and blockchain-friendly state, passing legislation in April to legally recognize DAOs, companies whose governance is built on smart contracts and where decision making is shared around the organization.

SHIB’s market value now rivals the stock-market value of the trading platform Robinhood (HOOD), at $30 billion. SHIB has also bounded over European banking giants Societe Generale ($28 billion) and Deutsche Bank ($26 billion).  That said, SHIB’s market cap is far more likely to hit the doghouse at a moment’s notice. Only time – often of short duration in the wild world of crypto – will tell.  Read more: Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB): A Beginner’s Guide 2021  As of press time, the cryptocurrency was changing hands at a minuscule $0.00007857, according to CoinGecko. Earlier in the day, the SHIB price hit an all-time high of $0.0000763. On a year-to-date basis, the price has jumped 40-fold.  The rise in the price of SHIB, named after the same dog breed that inspired the joke cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE), came as a petition “designed to kindly request of Robinhood to please list shiba inu coin to trade” circulated on the website Change.org.  “The focus on the cryptoverse was supposed to be on Ethereum 2.0 and a steady wave of [b]itcoin ETF investments, but the retail market has become fixated on shiba inu,” Edward Moya, senior markets analyst at the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote Wednesday in a daily email update.  CoinDesk’s traffic numbers would also bear this out.  Robinhood conference call  On Tuesday, Wall Street analysts peppered Robinhood executives on a conference call with questions as to when the company consider listing additional cryptocurrencies on its platform, according to a transcript.  “We’re hearing from customers that they want more coins,” CFO Jason Warnick said during the earnings conference call. “We’re being, you know, very mindful and diligent in this space. It’s evolving from a regulatory perspective. There’s been a number of questions raised about coins on other platforms being potentially unregistered securities.“  He added: “We think it’s the right thing, not just for shareholders and for the company, but also for customers to make sure that we, you know, apply the same kind of diligence to any new coins. ... We do hear our customers and they want more features, and so we’re going to be working, you know, as fast as we can with the right balance of safety and compliance to make sure that we don’t make missteps here.”  Twitter was replete this week with speculation that Robinhood might accede to the pressure.  Some analysts fret the sudden interest in SHIB might be an indication of frothy speculation and that a crash in the token’s value might lead to a broader retreat from cryptocurrency markets.  The SHIB token’s value surpassed that of dogecoin earlier Wednesday, according to most data sources.  Earlier this year, a frenzy of speculation in DOGE preceded a price slump in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that lasted several months.  “SHIB, also known as a ‘dogecoin killer,’ runs on Ethereum, but the use case argument isn’t quite there,” Oanda’s Moya wrote. “Shiba inu headlines are not the news that is needed to help drive crypto growth to the rest of Wall Street that is still hesitant on cryptocurrencies.“  Read more: SHIB Flippened DOGE With $160M in ‘Smart Money’ Backing Latest Pump, Blockchain Data Shows",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/27/shiba-inu-jumps-70-to-surpass-market-value-of-robinhood-where-its-not-yet-listed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65558fabb2c71a7a1465e8279801bc82c2bcab26-1440x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42396684,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4k56,1635369028,"CFTC Should Be Crypto’s ‘Primary Cop,’ Acting Chairman Says","The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is ready to be the main federal regulator for crypto, its acting head said Wednesday.  Rostin Behnam, the acting chairman of the CFTC, told the Senate Agriculture Committee that the commodities regulator is ready to become the primary federal regulator for digital assets, should Congress expand the agency’s remit.  Behnam was testifying as part of his confirmation hearing to serve a full term as chairman of the agency.  “The CFTC has responsibly and aggressively been pursuing enforcement cases in the digital asset marketplace for a number of years now,” Behnam said, pointing to the agency’s recent settlements with crypto exchange Kraken and stablecoin issuer Tether.  The regulator pointed to the size of the crypto market, noting the overall market capitalization is about $2.7 trillion now, and “nearly 60% were commodities.”  “I think it’s important for this committee to reconsider and consider expanding authority for the CFTC,” Behnam said.  He acknowledged that regulating crypto would be a “departure” from the agency’s historic role as a commodities regulator, but said the sector is important enough that the shift would be warranted.  “Given the size, the scope and the scale of this emerging market, how its interfacing and affecting customers, retail customers, and then with the scale of the growth being so rapid, potential financial stability risks in the future, I think it’s critically important to have a primary cop on the beat and certainly the CFTC is prepared to do that if this committee so wishes,” Behnam said.  Behnam later pointed to digital asset market transactions as posing a risk, including banking and prudential finance risks and clearing and settlement risks.  “We really also need to have a conversation about market regulation and sort of the exchange, the purchase and sale of these coins in a regulatory structure for both securities and commodities,” he said.  Brewing turf war?  The CFTC’s securities counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has also been moving to regulate the crypto market more. Under Chairman Gary Gensler, who took office earlier this year, the SEC has approved new bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs), expanding retail exposure to the digital asset sector.  Gensler has indicated that he believes the SEC may be best suited to become the primary cop for crypto.  In various public statements, Gensler has said the SEC should regulate exchanges like Coinbase because they may list securities, and oversee stablecoins, a segment of the crypto market where each token is pegged to a fiat currency like the dollar. He has said the SEC should also regulate decentralized finance (DeFi), which seeks to recreate some traditional financial tools and platforms without a centralized party in control.  In a congressional hearing, Gensler has also expressed his belief that “most” tokens are securities.  Congress will have to act to clarify regulation of the crypto market. At present, there is no federal regulator for spot crypto markets. The CFTC has the authority to oversee crypto derivatives markets and fraud within the underlying spot market, while the SEC has the authority to oversee securities and platforms that explicitly seek to list and trade securities.  Most crypto trading platforms are regulated at the state level, meaning they have to secure money transmitter licenses in each state they operate in. This piecemeal approach has received criticism from industry advocates because of the resources needed to secure nearly 50 different licenses.

42396689,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4k92,1635368967,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Dips Below $60K as ETF Enthusiasm Fades,"Bitcoin continues to decline after buyers failed to sustain last week’s all-time high of around $66,900. Analysts pointed to extreme optimism, leverage and profit-taking as possible reasons behind the latest pullback in BTC’s price.  Support, or the level at which buyers tend to invest, is around $53,000.  A pullback was overdue and more downside volatility could be in the offing, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported. For example, the estimated bitcoin leverage ratio, which is calculated by dividing futures’ open interest across all exchanges by bitcoin reserves on exchanges, is at the highest level since September, which preceded a crypto sell-off.  Bitcoin’s near-40% price rally over the past month was largely due to investor enthusiasm for the first bitcoin futures-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) introduced by ProShares last week. But some analysts expect the ETF hype will fade.  “Once investors realize that these futures ETFs create no new demand for BTC and are only a side bet on short-term price appreciation we may see significant price erosion,” Charlie Silver, co-founder of Blockforce Capital, a crypto multi-strategy trading firm, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $59,378.49, -3.92%  Ether (ETH): $4,014.58, -4.43%  S&P 500: $4,551.68, -0.51%  Gold: $1,797.91, +0.25%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.536%  “After a week of fresh highs, today’s sell-off is a warning not to be complacent in this market, especially when high levels of volatility are always around the corner,” Nicholas Cawley, an analyst at DailyFX, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Still, technical indicators show bitcoin’s pullback could stabilize. “We expect the pullback to mature quickly, within days, above initial support (~$52.9K) for bitcoin,” Katie Stockton, managing director of technical research firm Fairlead Strategies, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  BITO lags bitcoin  So far, the new ProShares fund’s returns are falling short of the performance of bitcoin in cryptocurrency markets – the very thing the ETF was supposed to track. BITO is also underperforming the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, which at $35.23 billion is the world’s largest bitcoin fund, CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma reported.  From Oct. 19, when the ProShares ETF started trading, through Tuesday, BITO shares were down by 2.45%, based on a chart shared by Grayscale, the company that sponsors GBTC. Bitcoin was down 1% over the same period and GBTC was up 7.5%. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  Read more here.  Short-term bitcoin holders take profits  Similar to long-term bitcoin holders (discussed in yesterday’s Market Wrap), blockchain data also shows short-term holders are starting to take profits after the ETF-driven price rally. This suggests market participants are uncertain about bitcoin’s short-term price direction.  The chart below shows a spike in short-term holder selling activity on Wednesday, as noted by CryptoQuant. Still, some analysts expect buyers to remain active on price dips, which typically occur during the early stages of a bull market.  “For the first time in a long time, a significant profit-taking has come in bitcoin, giving the market a short-term buying opportunity,” wrote one analyst on CryptoQuant’s live feed on Wednesday.

Both coins now have a market cap of over $31 billion, and are toggling between 10th and 11th on the CoinGecko’s rankings page. Blockchain data shows that while SHIB continues to attract retail investors around the globe, more sophisticated crypto traders fueled the latest rally. Since the start of this week, addresses labeled as “smart money” started buying SHIB, according to Nansen research analyst Daniel Khoo.  DBS joins Hedera Governing Council: Singapore’s DBS bank has become the first Southeast Asian lender to join the Hedera Governing Council, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reported.

42396685,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT4k65,1635368914,New Adobe Photoshop Feature to Support NFT Verification on Marketplaces,"Adobe, developer of the world’s most popular digital creators software, is entering the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) business.  A new feature on Adobe Photoshop will allow artists to prove they are the creators of artwork on NFT marketplaces, according to an Adobe blog post on Tuesday.  Content Credentials, as the feature is called, can capture identity data as an image is edited on the software and store it as metadata. The feature is optional, and the company has launched a website where the credential metadata of images can be verified.  Users can link their Adobe accounts, and Content Credentials, with social media profiles or crypto wallets. If they then sell their art as NFTs, the marketplaces will be able to show a digital certificate based on the Adobe-verified credentials. The credentials will also be linked on Behance, Adobe’s online portfolio site.  Adobe has formed partnerships with NFT marketplaces KnownOrigin, OpenSea, Rarible and SuperRare to display the credentials on their platforms.  By the end of the month, Photoshop will have a “prepare as NFT” feature powered by the Inter-Planetary File System, Scott Belsky, Adobe’s chief product officer, told The Verge. The feature will be available in preview, as it is not ready yet, Belsky said.  Adobe is responding to consumer demand, Belsky said. Artists complain that even if they mint their art made on Adobe software as NFTs, others can mint imitations of their art and there is no way to prove who is the original creator, he explained.  The Content Credentials feature is being rolled out to Photoshop users in beta mode.

Both coins now have a market cap of over $31 billion and are toggling between 10th and 11th on CoinGecko’s rankings page, as of press time.  Blockchain data shows that while SHIB continues to attract retail investors around the globe, more-sophisticated crypto traders are fueling the latest rally.  Since the beginning of this week, addresses labeled as “smart money” by blockchain data firm Nansen started buying up SHIB, according to Daniel Khoo, a research analyst at Nansen. The buying was mostly concentrated in the past seven days, worth about $160 million.  Addresses labeled as “smart money” include traders who made more than $100,000 in profit by providing liquidity and mining liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and public entities that invest in crypto.  “It was shocking to me,” Khoo said, adding that he didn’t expect SHIB to become accumulated by “smart money.”  Read more: Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB): A Beginner’s Guide 2021  Data from another blockchain data firm, Santiment, also supports the perspective.  SHIB transactions worth at least $1 million started increasing since the beginning of October, Santiment data shows. The whale activities spiked on multiple days in the past weeks, as SHIB’s price rallied.  Notably, while there have been a lot of SHIB spot activities on centralized exchanges, at press time roughly 66% of SHIB are on decentralized exchanges versus 13% on centralized exchanges, according to Nansen.  Over on centralized exchanges, SHIB’s trading volumes mostly come from Binance, Coinbase and BKEX, according to CoinGecko. Compared with Binance and Coinbase, BKEX is a little-known exchange started in China.  SHIB hits China  Google trends also revealed another interesting fact about shiba inu: Despite China doubling down on its crypto trading ban, traders in the East Asian country have shown an unquenchable appetite for SHIB that’s nearly as high as their counterparts in the United States.  At press time, Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge retail interest in trending topics, shows a value of 98 for the search query “SHIB” in China versus 100 in the U.S. over the past week.  A score of 100 represents peak popularity – the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time frame. It means more and more people are scanning the web for information on SHIB.  The finding is extraordinary considering the fact that the market has been talking down China’s influence on crypto for weeks. Chinese crypto traders may be lying low, but they have not quit crypto, as suggested by SHIB’s latest rally.

Finance appears to have been the target of a devastating exploit Wednesday morning that drained over $260 million in funds, likely the second-largest exploit to date.  According to Cream’s native front end, most Ethereum-based pools are now empty with the exception of a $40 million $CREAM pool. As of Oct 23, the protocol’s Ethereum markets had $300 million worth of assets.  Cream’s official Twitter account acknowledged the attack in a Tweet:  Per DeFi Llama, the protocol has an additional $460 million in total value locked (TVL) across Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche and Fantom. It is unclear if those funds are also at risk.  The funds appear to have been taken using a flash loan in a notably complex transaction that involved 68 different assets and cost over 9 ETH in gas. Of the $260 million lost, the attacker netted roughly $130 million in various cryptocurrencies, of which $40.6 million may be in illiquid crETH, a staked ETH derivative that may prove difficult for the attacker to sell.  The attacker is now working to “wash” the funds primarily using Ren’s Bitcoin bridge. As is often the case following exploits, individuals are now using Ethereum transactions to ask for donations.

The forthcoming raise comes as crypto firms are bringing in venture capital valuations that make tech “unicorn” status look quaint. A multibillion-dollar valuation would not be farfetched for Anchorage: Last week, London-based crypto custody firm Copper was reported to be raising $500 million at a $2.5 billion valuation.  Crypto custody, in particular, has become a hot sector, with banks and large fintechs looking to acquire firms specializing in the storage of digital assets, or at least secure a strategic stake in them.

The &apos;fear and greed index&apos; is an indicator that represents the general sentiment of the crypto market on a numeric scale that goes from 0 to 100. When the metric has values below 50, it means there is, on average, fear among investors. Values lower than 25 denote extreme fear. Such a sentiment is usually seen after big corrections, and periods of extreme fear may prove to be good buying opportunities. While the needle pointing above 50 means the crypto market is starting to get greedy. Extreme greed occurs when values exceed 75. Very high values near 100 may mean there will be a correction soon so investors may not buy more at this point.

Fight for the Future, Enjin and the Blockchain Game Alliance, along with 26 blockchain game companies, are calling on Valve to lift its ban on Web3 technologies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  “Games that utilize blockchain technology and web3 token-based technologies like DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) and NFTs can positively enhance the user experience of games, and create new economic opportunities for users and creators,” the companies said.  Steam is the largest digital distribution platform for PC games with 17 million to 24 million daily users.  A ban from the Steam platform effectively stymies a lucrative venue that blockchain games can use to market their games to the public.  Last month, Steam banned blockchain-based games from its platform, stating that items with value, such as NFTs, aren’t allowed because they possess real-world value that could potentially create a regulatory problem for Valve.  “Valve, Web3 games are a fast-moving and exciting category of games that have a place within the Steam ecosystem,” the companies said in their letter. “Please consider changing your stance on this issue and permit tokens and, more broadly, the use of blockchain tech on the Steam platform.”  Read more: GameStop Enters the Metaverse With ‘Web3 Gaming’ Job Post",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ENJ | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/27/29-blockchain-gaming-companies-pen-open-letter-to-valve-dont-ban-web3-games,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34beefa9c351aa9860089510295e204a01f93008-1500x993.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Asked about future acquisitions, the 28-year-old billionaire hinted he may be looking for another LedgerX, which was FTX’s August acquisition. LedgerX, a regulated U.S.-based crypto derivatives firm, is now part of FTX’s American unit, FTX.US. Buying LedgerX allowed FTX to sidestep a grueling registration process in the U.S.     “I would not be surprised if [the amount of money that we spend on acquisitions over the next year or so] was north of a billion dollars,” Bankman-Fried said on CoinDesk’s “First Mover.” Acquisition targets may offer relationships to regulators, licensing or “user-based” fiat on- or off-ramps, he added.  On Monday, FTX.US announced it finalized the acquisition of LedgerX, now called FTX US Derivatives. This follows a $420 million funding round that valued the parent FTX at $25 billion.  “There were a lot of potential acquisitions for us to be had and LedgerX was the start of it, but it’s not going to be the end,” Bankman-Fried said.  FTX is following a similar strategy to rival crypto exchange Binance, which has expanded its brand through licensing deals, local partnerships and a steady stream of acquisitions and investments.

42421205,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgrXB,1635359131,He Saw Iceland’s Banking Fraud From Inside. Now He’s Worried About Crypto,"Jared Bibler was in the belly of the beast. Then he got to perform the autopsy.  Bibler was an asset manager at Landsvaki, one of Iceland’s largest banks, from early 2007 to late 2008. By then he had seen enough rampant fraud at the bank to prompt him to jump ship. Less than two weeks later, the bank collapsed.  At the center of Iceland’s huge banking fraud was an elaborate scheme involving stock buybacks and shell companies, which had been going on since the late 1990s. Very quickly the entire Icelandic economy went down. Cash withdrawals were frozen, pensions were destroyed and the small nation’s stock market lost 90% of its value.  David Z Morris is CoinDesk’s Chief Insights Columnist.  Within months, in a very satisfying plot twist, Bibler had taken his insider knowledge to the Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland, where he served as an investigator, playing a major role in peeling the onion of fraud that led up to the collapse. Bibler recounts his days as an investigator, and his stunning findings, in the immensely readable new book “Iceland’s Secret: The Untold Story of the World’s Biggest Con.” (To learn more of the story, read CoinDesk’s in-depth review.)  Bibler now runs a private consulting firm focused on financial investigations, particularly “greenwashing” fraud meant to conceal corporate environmental misconduct. We talked about his perspective on finance as someone who grew up working class, what went wrong in Iceland and the prospects for a repeat of a crisis fueled by elite fraud.  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Tell me about the experience of living through the Icelandic crisis, when the stock market collapsed and failing banks had to limit cash withdrawals.  You know when you have that feeling like, “I’m hungry, what’s in the fridge?” As we were living through the crisis, instead of wondering “What’s in the fridge?” there was a new feeling of, “How much food do we have today?”  How much do we have in our wallets? How long will that last? When will the banks open again? It was a survival mentality for at least a few months. That was a trauma that changed the way I see the world. You realize money is just a construct – it’s a convenience, but it could be worth zero tomorrow. It was a different way of seeing life. That was the kind of visceral piece.  The second piece that I hope people take away would be extending that idea to the markets – there’s not as much there as we think.  You say it changed the way you see the world. How, exactly?  My view of the world is, the vast majority of people are hardworking and honest, and go through life in a pretty upstanding way. Then, it was very obvious in Iceland, there was this very small elite class that was rent-seeking on the people. That class has different words for when they’re going to screw somebody.  I come from a working-class background. And the common people are always the ones who pay the bill in the end. People like us who read the book, who know about markets, we’re shocked. But average people, the guy on the street, he already knew that the system is corrupt. They’re like, “Well, of course these guys are crooks.”  In Iceland the burden fell on people who had nothing, and then had less than nothing. The ease with which these [finance] guys could just see past that, or not be troubled by it, was really shocking to me. When I would bring up things like, “What about these other people?”, the response would be, “Why are you making problems?”  How has the book been received in Iceland? As your title points out, the real story is not well known.  People in Iceland are shocked. They don’t know the degree to which they were deceived with the stock market manipulation. Nobody ever came out and said, this was happening for 10 years, and everything about this market and what you invested in was a lie. The banker’s line today is that they did nothing wrong … The story is, things were fine in Iceland until Lehman [Brothers, whose failure was a major factor in the 2008 financial crash] came along. [In fact, the stock fraud at the center of the Icelandic crisis began 10 years before the global financial crisis.]  And because the story was never really told, I think the lessons never got learned in Iceland. And that was a big driver for me to write the book. I wanted to show the inside of the banks, and how wretched that was. This is how the system works.  I think we’re living on a sand castle financial system. I fear that Iceland 2008 is going to be the rest of us in 2030.  What happened to Iceland’s regulators? Aren’t they supposed to be watching for this kind of stuff?  [Regulatory agencies] hire people I would call “page turners.” The guy who can turn to some page and say, “We don’t do that here” and take his paycheck and go home. That culture is pervasive. They’re not aggressive. They’re not the people like you and me who get excited about some fraud and want to go after it.  Some agencies are better than others. The [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] brings a lot of little insider cases. But they don’t go after big systemic [problems].  He won’t let me quote him, but a Nobel economist told me, this is the story of every bank. They’re not all out there buying their own stock. But anything to boost their quarterly [results]. In a financial institution it’s easy to do that. Much easier than in a manufacturing firm.  We’re in the midst of a major debate about monetary policy, particularly in the U.S. Is there a relationship between fraud and the money supply?  The kind of hijinks the banks got up to would not have been possible without easy money. In this case the easy money came from the most profligate lenders in the world – the Germans. Deutsche Bank never met a loan they didn’t want to make. And the German government backs them up.  So [Icelandic banks] always had enough cash to do the [stock] manipulations. That enabled what I see as the fundamental fraud that underlay [the banks’] growth.  More generally, when there’s too much cash sloshing around, people in society make terrible decisions. There’s a lot of fraud and a lot of conspicuous consumption. They sold more Range Rovers in Iceland than in Norway and Sweden combined in 2007 and 2008. My wife’s job [later] was to repossess all those cars.  You had a pretty unique path into banking, as a person who grew up not just working class but surrounded by economic decline.  I grew up in Billerica, Mass. It’s probably pretty Trumpy [Republican] these days. Working class, no hope. So I was kind of a miracle. I was first in my class and I got into MIT.  Because I came up working class, people think that if you’re at MIT your life is fixed. But it turns out it’s not true, because you have to figure out what to do with your life. After I graduated, I got involved in a dot-com that was a big fraud.  They were selling software that didn’t exist. Vaporware. Coming out of MIT, it’s a hard place to go to school, and everything is very factual. If you design a machine that doesn’t work, it falls apart right away. You can’t get around physics. But these guys did it all the time.  They had these high-pressure sales guys. They’d go into an insurance company and say, we can give you a complete claims management system … Like Enron, as soon as they made that software deal, they booked that revenue. Goldman Sachs took them public, and they had 12 or 20 customer lawsuits against them … The sales guys would get a 10% cut, do a couple deals and move to the Caymans or something. Absolutely zero ethics.  It wasn’t a great experience while I was there, but it was a learning experience. Their biggest clients were Enron, HealthSouth and Global Crossing [some of the most notorious frauds of the dot-com bubble]. They were only missing WorldCom.  After that, you got a position with a more above-board operation.  I went to building global back-office software for Morgan Stanley. It was super-hard work but a very good learning experience, and what we delivered I can believe in. That’s another example of something that has to work – they have to settle their trades every day.  Then I went to Iceland and it was just bubblegum and toothpicks.  If the tendency of the financial world is towards fraud, how does crypto fit in?  To take an example, someone here in Switzerland was building a real estate token … which is a cool idea, it’s fine. But none of the things in a regulated fund are being done. It was an even less transparent thing, but because it was packaged up in a token it was like, whoo, exciting.  It seemed like a way to do what every fund manager wants to do – take in a lot of money, charge a big fee and who cares what you do with it. Where you invest that money is often secondary.  I have a lot of worries about crypto being financially [misused]. There’s a whole infrastructure being built where people are packaging things in different ways. I see a lot of the problems in asset management being replicated over in crypto.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

42410948,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtjfb,1635357930,From Pancake Batter to Bitcoin Mining: Struggling Businesses Try 2017-Style Pivots,"Which is harder, mining bitcoin or selling pancake batter?  Nate’s Foods is about to find out.  The little-known, publicly traded company, based in Huntington Beach, Calif., announced Oct. 25 that it has started mining the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market value. Ditching its original product – premixed pancake and waffle batter in pressurized cans – Nate’s has leased miners manufactured by Bitmain to earn new bitcoin at a rate of 500 terahashes per second.  Nate’s said it plans to ramp up its hashrate, or computer processing power, to 1,500 terahashes per second with the two-year-old model S-17 miners. Nate’s expects those machines to generate about $17,060 per month in revenue.  That would be a step up from the food business, which was flat as a pancake financially for Nate’s – it reported no sales in the fiscal quarter that ended Aug. 31, the most recent period for which it has disclosed results. Nate’s penny stock, which is traded on the over-the-counter markets, has more than tripled in price since the company announced the radical shift in its business model on Sept. 30.  Nate’s is the latest in a long line of companies from different industries pivoting or diversifying to mining or other crypto-related activities. First seen during the 2017 bull market, the trend is making a comeback as bitcoin trades near all-time highs and the crackdown on crypto activities in China, once the world’s mining epicenter, has thinned the competitive field.  Weak tea  An uncharitable interpretation is that such moves are merely ploys to pump up a failing company’s share price. That appeared to be the case with Long Blockchain, formerly Long Island Iced Tea, whose attempt to cash in on the 2017 blockchain frenzy famously soured, making it a poster child for boom-time excesses. Its stock was eventually delisted because of the company’s failed attempt to transition itself into a blockchain player. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged three individuals with insider trading.  If done properly, however, pivoting to mining can succeed, even if a company’s previous business had nothing to do with crypto. For example, Riot Blockchain, which used to be a biotech company called Bioptix, changed its name and business model in 2017. It is now one of the top publicly traded crypto miners, with a market capitalization above $2 billion.  Nate’s Food took the plunge into crypto mining after its CEO, Nate Steck, saw other OTC-traded companies entering the sector. He wanted to guard his company against another supply chain crisis such as the one created by the coronavirus pandemic, he said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk.  “I wanted to get away from the whole disruption of goods and services,” Steck said. So he contacted a crypto mining consultant and started “checking boxes” on what would quickly propel shareholder value and increase revenue.  “The bottom line is that crypto mining has an immediate return on our investment,” Steck said. “Future projects will develop as the coin platform opportunities become similar to the early stages of the internet,” he noted. Nate’s created a subsidiary, Nate’s Mining, and a Twitter handle to reflect its new focus.  Other recent converts to crypto mining include Chinese sports lottery firm 500.com (NYSE: WBAI), which announced in January It will start buying bitcoin miners and has ramped up efforts throughout this year. A shipping company, Sino-Global (SINO), hired executives in February to spearhead the company’s entry into bitcoin mining. In April, a Florida-based longevity and wellness product manufacturer, Graystone Company (GYST), announced it would move into bitcoin mining to improve its own financial health.  Days of plenty  The switch to crypto mining is no surprise when companies are losing money or don’t have a sustainable business model. According to a research note by Jonathan Petersen, an analyst at the Jefferies investment firm, bitcoin mining has been a high-margin business with a short payback period, or the length of time required for an investment to recover its initial outlay.  “This year has been one of the best environments for BTC mining in North America due to the reduction in competition following China’s mining ban and the ongoing global chip shortage, which also puts a cap on new BTC miners being deployed,” he wrote.  DA Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler estimated that for a “best in class” miner with access to cheap power, the average cost to mine a bitcoin is around $5,000, with gross margins as high as 90%, even if bitcoin trades around $50,000. (It’s in the high $50s as of press time.)  He estimated that for miners such as Marathon Digital, the gross margin, or profit retained by a company after operating costs, will be about 89.6% in 2021 and 90.8% in 2022.  With such margins, it’s easy to see why companies would be tempted to start a crypto mining business. However, it will require a long-term strategy to make the move truly profitable, said Zack Voell, director of content and research at Compass Mining.  “Current market conditions make bitcoin mining an extremely profitable activity for almost anyone. But rushing into financing a large-scale mining operation because of current profitability can end in disaster,” he said, cautioning would-be miners to resist fear of missing out (FOMO).  “Any company that wants to dabble in cryptocurrency mining should ignore FOMO and prepare a multi-year strategy for their operations,” Voell said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/27/from-pancake-batter-to-bitcoin-mining-struggling-businesses-try-2017-style-pivots,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4515620f893f79c193a712405277feb81e7ae36f-1440x956.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The brand overhaul kicked off in January with the hiring of Koto, a design agency. According to a voting website launched today, the vote is the result of months of “qualitative feedback” from users and developers.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Polkadot brand bounty curator Kaye Han said the new branding is key to reaching a casual audience as the project expands, and that it may be a first when it comes to decentralizing brand management.  “The Polkadot ecosystem’s needs for the brand has grown immensely and has struggled to effectively communicate its increased complexity,” said Han. “It’s only by involving the community throughout the process can a more flexible, adaptable and extensible design language be created. This is a novel and experimental approach that is far from perfect, but it’s a step in the right direction in exploring decentralized branding.”  DOT token holders have the option of selecting one of two design formats for future web and social layouts, as well as one of two new logos – all inspired by dots and featuring various animation styles.

42394395,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcl6n,1635356255,The FTC Doesn’t See the Difference Between Crypto and LuLaRoe,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Oct. 26 sent what’s known as a “Notice of Penalty Offense” to more than 1,000 companies, including the crypto exchanges Blockchain, Gemini, U.K.-based Bixo and other fintech and crypto firms. The notices, which warn businesses not to overstate the earning potential of investments or business opportunities, were also sent to a large number of gig-work platforms, multi-level marketing firms (MLMs) and franchise companies, all of which can sometimes resemble exploitative pyramid schemes, and often leave would-be entrepreneurs feeling duped.  The agency makes clear that the notices are not in any way indicative of misconduct by the companies. Instead, the regulator says the companies are now “on notice that if they deceive or mislead consumers about potential earnings, the FTC won’t hesitate to use its authority to target them with large civil penalties.” At worst, it seems plausible that crypto exchanges have made what the FTC sees as excessively optimistic statements about the growth potential or safety of speculative cryptocurrency investment, and the notice is a warning to cool their jets a bit.  Unfortunately, that has left the exchanges lumped in with some companies that I would argue are far more exploitative. “Gig” platforms also getting FTC warnings included Amazon and Amazon Web Services (with their Mechanical Turk and gig-delivery systems), as well as Fiverr, Postmates, Upwork and Uber. Investigations have shown that such gigs often amount to working for below minimum wage.  The list also includes MLMs with names like Candle Divas, Closet Candy and Herbalife. These companies offer “business opportunities” often requiring huge startup costs that turn them, in effect, into insider-enrichment schemes. The dynamics were recently chronicled in the documentary “LuLaRich,” about clothing MLM LuLaRoe (which also received an FTC warning yesterday). MLMs remain legal, in part thanks to the political clout of people like Trump administration Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.  Finally, the list includes a lot of franchise operations. These are also sometimes twisted into something very closely resembling an MLM, with large up-front licensing fees that drive revenue for a parent company but leave franchisees deep in a hole. I strongly recommend the in-depth examination of franchising as a labor-law workaround by the podcast “The Uncertain Hour.”  As much as we may hate to see crypto exchanges lumped in with such sketchy categories, there are important takeaways. First and most simply, the inclusion should be taken seriously as an index of how regulators still often see crypto: as a den of scammers looking to grift regular people. As genuinely exciting as crypto is right now, it’s worth keeping that context in mind before, say, hitting “send” on some dumb Tweet about how bitcoin is going to be worth a million dollars per coin by 2022. A little restraint could help the sector earn better treatment by regulators.  The second takeaway is more complex, and has to do with the economic context for crypto’s growth. The FTC points out in its announcement that “as the [coronavirus] pandemic has left many people in dire financial straits, money-making pitches have proliferated and gained special attention …  “Americans are bombarded by offers that often prove to be less than advertised.”  This is actually underplaying it: The explosion of MLMs and gig work stretches back to the aftermath of the Great Recession, when good jobs became much, much more scarce. Both models often exploit either the desperation triggered by joblessness or the dream of entrepreneurial independence held by many workers who see themselves as miserable wage slaves.  While cryptocurrency is a real and substantive innovation, the truth is that much crypto investment is driven by the same economic context. Over the years I’ve seen some really worrisome behavior (such as mortgaging houses for leverage) from people hoping to get rich quick on crypto and escape their economic straitjackets.  Obviously, that has worked out for many in the short term, but many crypto prices (like the prices of many stocks right now) are still well above what’s justified by actual user demand. That means they’re still speculative and risky, particularly for smaller retail investors who can’t weather downturns or bad bets. Long-term faith in the sector will benefit from clearly communicating the exciting potential of these new technologies – but also clearly laying out their risks as investments.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

42413896,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAlscr,1635355838,It’s BITO vs. GBTC vs. BTC as Bitcoin ETF Wars Heat Up,"The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy exchange-traded fund (stock ticker BITO) turned heads last week when it hauled in more than $1 billion of assets in two days, the fastest exchange-traded fund (ETF) ever to hit that milestone.  But so far, the new ProShares fund’s returns are falling short of the performance of bitcoin in cryptocurrency markets – the very thing the ETF was supposed to track. BITO is also underperforming the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, which at $35.23 billion is the world’s largest bitcoin fund. (Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  From Oct. 19, when the ProShares ETF started trading, through Tuesday, BITO shares were down by 2.45%, based on a chart shared by Grayscale, the company that sponsors GBTC. Bitcoin was down 1% over the same period, and GBTC was up 7.5%.  The discrepancy has rekindled criticism of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to allow an ETF focused on bitcoin futures – as is the case for ProShares – but not an ETF that would be backed directly by bitcoin, known as a “spot ETF.”  Grayscale is pushing hard to convert GBTC into a spot bitcoin ETF, citing some of the disadvantages of a futures-based ETF. Those include the risk of “roll costs” or “contango bleed” – a source of underperformance that stems from the unique structure of futures markets.  BITO’s launch has helped to drive up the price of bitcoin futures on the Chicago-based CME exchange, which in turn “has also been driving spot prices higher,” Grayscale noted in Tuesday in a newsletter.  “The product has seen strong inflows since launch, demonstrating investor appetite for accessing the crypto markets,” Grayscale wrote. “But it may also come at the expense of U.S. bitcoin futures ETF investors.”  GBTC discount  Market signals reveal the tension in the battle among the ETF aspirants.  GBTC’s price is currently trading at a steep 17% discount to the market price of its underlying bitcoin.  Bloomberg commodities analyst Mike McGlone wrote last week that the GBTC discount might evaporate if the trust was allowed to convert to an ETF.  “Grayscale has said it’s committed to converting GBTC to an ETF,” wrote McGlone in a market update shared with CoinDesk. ”We see that as a matter of time, notably with a new digital divide opening [against] China, which may make bitcoin and crypto success a vested interest of the U.S.”  Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg tweeted that GBTC beating BITO is a nice run, but not reliable since the bitcoin trust’s “premium/discount” is a “big unknown variable.”  Chances of a spot bitcoin ETF  Analysts for Arcane Research wrote this week that the discount reflects the dim chances of the spot ETF getting approved anytime soon.  “Shares in the GBTC have never traded at a higher discount, indicating that the market is not expecting the SEC to accept a spot-based ETF,” Arcane Research wrote in a weekly report.  Grayscale, however, says it’s confident that a spot ETF will eventually see daylight.  “It’s not a question of if but when a bitcoin spot ETF will gain approval from the SEC,” according to the firm.  “We believe that the SEC’s decision to permit a futures-based ETF takes the market a step closer to a bitcoin spot ETF,” Grayscale wrote. “We believe this continued institutionalization and increased market access to crypto will further increase investor excitement and portfolio adoption.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/27/its-bito-vs-gbtc-vs-btc-as-bitcoin-etf-wars-heat-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54b32b70abfd5c214cf6530f67b7a4c7dcb7b0d1-1440x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421029,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBHYb,1635354518,The Revolving Door Is Good for Bitcoin,"Brian Brooks went from a law firm to a bank to a mortgage company to a crypto exchange to America’s top banking regulatory agency to a crypto exchange again. He’s on the market again – but which way will it be, public sector or private?  The lanky Colorado native with his shock of sandy-brown hair is quite familiar with the revolving door, and may even epitomize the best and the worst of the well-trodden corridor between private interests and public service. A dizzying number of former regulators – attracted by eye-popping valuations – are returning to private life at crypto firms while, to a lesser extent, business leaders are heading to public office. This trend is not unique to crypto and raises questions about whose interests these public offices truly serve: their own or the people’s.  This article is an addition to CoinDesk’s Policy Week.  “If you’re looking for regulation that facilitates commerce and promotes growth, then you want somebody who understands the details of the industry and knows what frameworks are required to get customers comfortable and create safety,” Brooks said in a phone call, dialing in from an airport in the bustling crypto hub of Miami.  His career in brief: After graduating from the University of Chicago Law School in 1994, Brooks was hired by the national law firm O’Melveny & Myers in Washington, D.C., where he worked for 17 years. In 2011, he joined the legal team at OneWest Bank led by future Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a bank once called a “foreclosure machine.”  Mnuchin was one of Brooks’ clients at O’Melveny & Myers, as was Fannie Mae, the privately owned but U.S. government-supported mortgage giant placed into conservatorship as a result of the 2008 financial crisis; Brooks joined in 2014. He turned down a position to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2017, and the following year a passion for crypto led him to take a position as Coinbase’s top lawyer and an advisory role at decentralized credit network Spring Labs. In 2020, Brooks was tapped by Donald Trump to serve as acting comptroller of the currency during the final months of the administration under Mnuchin.  At the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), informed by his previous time in the public sector, he says, Brooks moved quickly. In just 10 months, he issued a series of interpretative letters allowing banks to custody crypto, hold stablecoin reserves and serve as nodes on public blockchain networks as well as issuing national banking charters to crypto firms Anchorage, Paxos and Protego. It was perhaps the most significant regulatory advance for the industry since the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) classified bitcoin as a commodity in 2014.  “What I’ve always tried to do in all of my jobs is to make an impact. I think in our market economy there are people in all kinds of sectors who make a big impact. There are people who are public servants working in the government. There are people who are making an impact running big companies,” Brooks told Bloomberg Law in 2015.  Brooks was something of a forerunner when it comes to the increasing connection between crypto startups and public institutions. Though there are legitimate concerns about potential conflicts of interest when regulators and business people can easily swap places, this cross-pollination may also lead to good policy. Certain roadblocks remain in place, legacies from a similar portal between Wall Street and Washington, but crypto presents its own set of issues.  Playing catch-up  “As crypto becomes more mainstream, as crypto seeks more institutional acceptance, as crypto seeks legitimacy in [Washington,] D.C., more crypto firms will be looking to get people involved in government into their firms,” Timi Iwayemi, a research assistant who works on the crypto beat at the Revolving Door Project at Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank, said. Although Iwayemi’s project doesn’t keep hard data, he noted that crypto seems to be playing “catch-up” in its attempt to influence policy by hiring from public officials.  In recent months, at least three former U.S. commodities regulators have announced signing contracts with private cryptocurrency firms. All signaled their support of the emerging industry while still in office at the CFTC. This includes digital dollar advocates Chris Giancarlo, aka “Crypto Dad” for his pro-crypto touch; Daniel Gorfine, who led the in-agency digital currency lab; and stablecoin-defender Brian Quintenz. Mark Wetjen, who led the CFTC for five years beginning in 2011, joined crypto exchange MIAX to expand operations into futures and derivatives products.  They are by no means alone. Jay Clayton, the former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman who once said the majority of cryptocurrencies looked like pot-shot securities, joined the advisory board of the crypto custody provider Fireblocks. He’s also a paid adviser to the hedge fund One River Digital Asset Management, which has exposure to bitcoin and ether. “I’ve always loved the potential efficiencies of this technology,” Clayton told the Financial Times when joining Fireblocks.  “Industry knowledge isn’t siloed,” Iwayemi said.  Binance, which has been filling its ranks with regulatory-whispers, hired former Treasury Department investigator Greg Monahan and Max Baucus, former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Blockchain.com courted the former adviser to President Barack Obama, Jim Messina, to its board. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), a venture capitalist firm with an increasingly ambitious crypto book, is in a category of its own. The firm, which announced a multibillion-dollar crypto fund and initiative to educate pols on Web 3, recently brought on former fellow prosecutor Katie Haun, former director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance Bill Hinman and Brent McIntosh, the former Treasury Department official who specialized in the regulation of digital assets.  “Crypto companies recruiting former regulators is a signal that the industry understands that the mainstreaming of crypto will be a very bumpy road if we don’t level up our expertise around compliance and risk as well as proactively engage, educate and advocate more productively with policy makers,” Chief Policy Officer Teana Baker-Taylor at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a crypto lobbying group, said.  By and large, positions created for former overseers are sinecures – ambiguously defined “advisory” roles that offer legitimacy but maybe not business smarts. Often companies are paying for a type of branding, other times for a Rolodex. The connections people created while in government can help business insiders get meetings – say, at the U.S. Treasury or SEC – that can help establish some firms above their competitors, Iwayemi said.  Paying for power and influence might be anti-competitive, but perhaps, at this stage of the game, any favorable policy decisions will lift all boats. “Of course [the revolving door] becomes less desirable once the business interests ‘capture’ the regulators; but I gather there is not yet much danger of that,” right-libertarian leaning economist George Selgin said in an email. Coinbase, the leading U.S. crypto exchange, seems not to have translated into any lasting favors with regulators, despite its calls for increased regulation.  This game of musical chairs between regulators and business folk is just one prong of an industry trying to establish legitimacy and dominance. As CoinDesk reported last week, the crypto industry has also seen a measurable uptick in the amount of dollars spent lobbying regulators, enforcers and politicians. The money can be spent on bespoke lobbying groups within firms, on outside agitators like the Blockchain Association and Coin Center or even in the form of campaign donations. Despite many firms doubling or tripling their influence-spend, or starting up a program, CoinDesk found little evidence the money is having an effect.  Read more: Crypto Learns to Play the DC Influence Game  Fewer people have followed Brooks’ model by heading into public office with experience in crypto. Chainalysis former chief technical counsel Michael Mosier joined the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as acting director last spring.  Brooks has had a hand in shaping some of those policies, but his legacy is in doubt. Last month, the New York Times did a special report detailing how the nation’s largest accounting firms have paid dividends sending their own employees to work at places like the Treasury or Internal Revenue Service (IRS). “The accounting industry’s back-and-forth arrangements get results. The taxes that corporations pay, as a percentage of GDP, have been shrinking for years,” the Time’s Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote.  If only Brooks could be so lucky. According to some industry experts, there’s some chance that current OCC or Treasury officials could rewrite Brooks’s pro-crypto rules. There are signs that firms like Circle and Figure, which are applying for bank charters, may face a harder time getting approved. Brooks, for his part, feels secure in his legacy. “You’re going to find that it’s really hard to rescind bank charters,” he said. Further, his stablecoin guidance “was super-tightly lawyered.”  Another issue with the revolving door in crypto is that sometimes it doesn’t seem to stop spinning. As noted, Brooks took an abrupt departure from Binance.US, citing “strategic differences” with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. But so did Giancarlo, who left BlockFi just as intense regulatory scrutiny of the firm’s lending product kicked up, four months after starting. Brett Redfearn, the ex-SEC official, also left Coinbase after just four months. These quick departures highlight the precarious nature of diving headfirst into crypto.  “That may be a case where they feel like this is something they do not want to actually legitimize,” Iwayemi said. But there’s a litany of potential reasons why it may be so difficult for crypto firms to retain their regulatory talent – ranging from cultural misfits to regulatory uncertainty, he added. “In a way it’s kind of a blight on the industry … it [raises] the question of what is going wrong,” Iwayemi said.

Governments rely on industry expertise from the private sector when forming policy. But the easy exchange between top executives in the financial sector and watchdog agencies has had its effect. It’s the exception to the rule that cabinet-level positions, or ranking enforcers, will have ties to industry at some point in the past or will leave their perch for “greener” pastures. That’s such the case that The Wall Street Journal cheered former FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair (now in crypto) for heading straight to the Pew Charitable Trusts, a public policy charity.  This is despite the fact that there are long-standing rules meant to prevent the worst forms of pay-for-play influence. The Federal Reserve has checks on bank supervisions going straight into private practice (the rules were strengthened in 2016, after public pushback). SEC enforcers are “barred for life” from dealing with specific parties they managed while at the commission. Senior officials and commissioners are barred from lobbying the SEC for at least one year after leaving. But rules only have so much effect. One of President Obama’s first executive orders was to place limits around lobbyists that worked for the administration – only to see 20% “deregistering” to skirt the rules.  Play book  Iwayemi says that stricter rules will be necessary across the financial sector, and might need to have specific crypto provisions. But there’s also a positive agenda that can be enforced: governments, instead of turning to the private sector, should look for future regulators and legislators among those with a strong history of public works. They can come from academia, non-profits, even journalism – “industry knowledge isn’t siloed,” he said.  It should also be noted that ex-industry men can prove hardliners in office. The prime example is Gary Gensler, a Goldman Sachs alum who wrote tough derivatives rules while at the CFTC. He’s continued that track at the SEC, where the former MIT professor who taught blockchain courses is gearing up to take tough action against the crypto industry. Further, the informed opinions of SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce show that you need not have a stake in the industry to want to see it succeed.  The revolving door is much derided in popular culture – perhaps as the most emblematic fault of a corrupt system that favors elites. But at the same time, perhaps at a societal level, we just don’t care. When you google “revolving door” site:nytimes.com you are as likely to come across an article on the circular modes of egress than the popular term for the portal between public and private life. Rules can be enforced, people can be shamed, but it’s also a matter for individual regulators to wrestle with. Do I self-deal or not?  It is both unlikely and unfair to cut large swaths of the population out of ever serving the public – it would be operating from the point of view that capitalists can never be trusted. But America has always been a country that aims for the highest liberal ideals – placing innocence before doubt and the possibility of redemption. If interested parties want to serve the public, should they not be given the benefit of the doubt?  So how then might we set policy that inspires them to serve the good of the nation, rather than their own ends? How can we create more Genslers who choose the written law over the law of the markets? I asked Iwayemi.  “That is a difficult philosophical question. A simple answer is: Better pay would definitely lead to stronger government capacity and longer retention of staff. When people are compensated they are happy to stay in sustained public service.” Either way, it comes down to personal enrichment.

42394389,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvckmH,1635354379,We Are Already Living in a Post-Scarcity World,"One of the most hotly debated topics in the world of blockchain and economics today centers on inflation and interest rates, and the future of the economy. Quite a few people believe the case for investing in some cryptocurrencies is built on the likelihood of future inflation, something they see as a near certainty given the combination of low interest rates and quantitative easing.  Given that interest rates represent the “cost” of money, interest rates that are near zero imply that money is, in a sense, free or very nearly free. Consequently, there’s a risk that people will use too much of it, leading to inflation as consumers chase a limited supply of goods, in turn reducing their value as prices rise. But what if that calculation is wrong in many cases because there isn’t a limited supply of goods?  Paul Brody is EY’s global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  If you live in the San Francisco Bay Area, as I do, electric cars and self-driving test vehicles seem routine these days. If you live in China, you’ve probably haven’t been using cash for ages. It’s not just that some geographies are further ahead than others; some parts of our lives are as well. Instant access to nearly every piece of music ever made? Check. Quick visit to the department of motor vehicles? Probably not in my lifetime.  While progress may be uneven, it is increasingly clear that many of us are starting to live – at least partially – in a post-scarcity world of unlimited supply. Futurists have talked about this possibility for so long, and it has seemed so far away, that we may be failing to observe its slow but steady arrival. In science fiction, this abundant future is often shown as a place of unlimited physical products, but it’s actually arriving as an era of unlimited digital services and ever cheaper, but not free, products. As a result, the future is sneaking up on us nearly unnoticed. For all human history, scarcity was the condition where we lived. Scarcity of food, shelter, warmth, education – whatever it was, there was never enough of it to go around.  For many, the world looks different today. More and more of what we consume has an effectively infinite supply. There is a seemingly unlimited supply of short format videos. No matter how many you watch, you can never consume them all and nobody else is being deprived.  Digital goods have a unique property in that they offer a truly infinite supply at zero marginal cost, but even other products and services are slowly but surely headed in the same direction. Though the cost of a new television or a house may never be zero, they are all headed forever lower thanks to continuously rising worker productivity. In many cases, they will eventually be so inexpensive as to be, for all practical purposes, free.  Additionally, the “zero cost” element of digital technology is gradually impacting every other industry. Gasoline-powered cars are complex mechanical systems where thousands of little gas explosions each minute propel you forward, and they depend upon fuel made from dead dinosaurs. Electric cars, on the other hand, are practically smartphones with batteries and wheels, where much of the value comes in the form of software – which, again, has zero marginal cost. The energy used for these electric cars can come from the sun, which is apparently good for another few billion years.  A “zero cost” market may seem like something new, given that the digitization of our economy has significantly accelerated how consumption works in the last 50 years. But, if you zoom out far enough, there is some compelling new evidence that this trend towards ever lower costs of everything did in fact start a long time ago. How long ago? About 800 years, according to a recent paper by Paul Schmelzing, a visiting researcher at the Bank of England. Typical interest rates of around 15% in the 1300s have given way, over centuries, to real interest rates close to zero.  If Schmelzing is right, the current bout of “free money” isn’t a temporary situation brought on by a global recession and a pandemic, it’s going to be a permanent feature of the global economy going forward. And if that is true, we might want to start thinking about what the world looks like in that post-scarcity future. If money is free and low interest rates don’t fuel inflation in many segments of the economy, then perhaps giving it away – to lots of people, all of the time – is a perfectly reasonable idea.  The consequences of this shift could be large but unpredictable. While scarce physical goods facing supply-chain bottlenecks are rising in price, many digital products and services face no such capacity pressure, making them even cheaper by comparison. That might mean a shift towards even more digital consumption. Alternatively, it might also mean more and more of the money that is available is going to be directed at things that really are scarce, leading to accelerating price increases in other areas such as real estate. “Buy land,” the saying goes, “…they’re not making any more of it.”  A post-scarcity world is arriving and it’s time we started adjusting our view of the economy and, along with it, the value proposition of all our technologies. Blockchains, which can only exist thanks to a near-zero cost of computing, are set to become one of the main mechanisms for efficiently managing scarcity. The role of this technology in the future of our economy looks pretty secure.

The company has started a pre-sale of the machines and set up a wait list on its website. Customers can pay for just one miner to get started.  Once clients buy the miners, they will be responsible for the electricity fees and a monthly hosting charge for the machines.  The first miner will go online in early 2022, according to an emailed statement from River Financial CEO Alex Leishman. The service will be initially available to clients in the U.S., but the company plans to expand the program globally in 2022, he said.  The product comes at a time when bitcoin mining has become a lucrative business with high profit margins thanks to a rally in the price of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market value. However, the challenges of setting up machines and the lack of access to cheap electricity have made moving into the sector challenging for new entrants. “Chip shortages, supply chain breakdowns and high residential energy costs have made entering mining more difficult,” Leishman said.  “River Mining removes these barriers for clients by making it easy to own, manage and generate bitcoin with their personal bitcoin mining fleets,” he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/27/river-financial-to-let-clients-mine-bitcoin-without-having-to-set-up-run-machines,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5a6fed4c3184a0d9ea41076b6882f557aecfc37-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The funds will help accelerate the development of AI Arena, a player vs. player fighting game where the characters are powered by artificial intelligence (AI). The game is based on the Ethereum blockchain.  AI Arena players own their own fighters that contain typical non-fungible token (NFT) attributes such as power, speed and accuracy. The fighters are also embedded with an artificial neural network, enabling them to operate autonomously.  “You have this autonomous AI that can compete with other autonomous AI around the world. The goal is to train [the fighter] to get better and better so you can earn more on our play-to-earn platform,” ArenaX founder and CEO Brandon Da Silva told CoinDesk in an interview.  Read more: Osmosis Closes $21M Token Sale Led by Paradigm  The AI fighters are trained through either imitation learning, where the player takes control and “teaches” the AI character how to react to a variety of circumstances, or self-play, where the AI character is set loose to start training on its own.  The play-to-earn aspect of AI Arena involves ranked battles where leaderboard standings determine the number of tokens a player receives. Da Silva says ArenaX is planning a wagered battle mode further down the line where players can bet against their opponent.  ArenaX expects to launch AI Arena at the end of the first quarter of 2022 or the beginning of the second quarter, Da Silva told CoinDesk.  “We love the team and think the concept of AI characters as collectibles is ingenious.

FTX has put its name seemingly everywhere when it comes to sports advertising, including the arena for the National Basketball Association’s Miami Heat, Major League Baseball umpire shirts and the University of California Berkeley’s football stadium.  “Of course we’re doing the Super Bowl thing,” Bankman-Fried said in a statement to CoinDesk, referring to the biggest event in the U.S. pro football world. “Would you really expect us not to? We actually wanted to buy the Super Bowl itself but they don’t yet accept cryptocurrency. So we’re settling for buying ad time.”  Bankman-Fried noted that sports sponsorships make sense because “sports fans are two times more likely to know about crypto than non-sports fans. Avid sports fans are nearly three times as likely,” citing research from Morning Consult.  NFL quarterback Tom Brady and supermodel wife Gisele Bündchen already own stakes in FTX and serve as ambassadors for the exchange.  A plethora of crypto-related commercials are expected to be aired this year during Super Bowl LVI as the industry moves towards targeting mainstream consumers.  Bankman-Fried declined to discuss the length of the ad or say how much FTX is paying to run it. According to sportingnews.com, the price of a 30-second ad for Super Bowl LV in 2021 was $5.5 million.

Paradigm led the foundation’s first fundraising with participation from Robot Ventures, Nascent, Ethereal, Figment and Do Kwon, Terraform Labs’ CEO.  An AMM is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that relies on a mathematical formula or algorithms to price crypto assets in liquidity pools. Osmosis users can compound yield through a technology called Superfluid Staking.  Token holders typically have to choose between staking yield, which helps provide protocol security, or liquidity yield. Superfluid Staking allows holders of OSMO, the governance token of Osmosis, to use their tokens for staking and liquidity at the same time, maximizing the potential rewards without compromising network security.  Osmosis is on the Cosmos ecosystem, the so-called “internet of blockchains” that connects other cryptocurrency networks and helps them work together. Since its launch in June, Osmosis says the total value locked (TVL) on its DEX has reached $500 million. TVL is the U.S. dollar value of the cryptocurrency committed to DeFi protocols that are built on a layer 1 blockchain.  “Osmosis is our first AMM investment outside of the Ethereum ecosystem,” said Charlie Noyes, investment partner at Paradigm, in the press release. “The launch of IBC, Cosmos’ cross-chain interoperability protocol, kicked off a Cambrian explosion of developer activity and experimentation.

The seven-month-old protocol, which at press time held over $800 million in crypto assets, said Jump Capital and Alameda Research led the “strategic investment.” Tulip recently rebranded; it won a $25,000 hackathon prize as “SolFarm” in June.  Pseudonymous CEO “Senx” said in a phone interview that Tulip intends to double its five-person team. A shortage of Solana-focused engineers could complicate that goal, he said, underscoring the heated competition for DeFi developer talent.

42421206,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgraH,1635343009,A Crypto Whisperer on How Regulators Toss Retail Into the Deep End,"The big crypto story last week was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a bitcoin futures ETF. For the uninitiated, ETFs are exchange-traded funds: investment vehicles that track the performance of an underlying asset. For years, crypto companies have been trying to set up a bitcoin ETF, which would allow traders exposure to crypto via non-crypto exchanges. A bitcoin futures ETF, though, comes with some caveats, one of which is the concept of “contango.” Detractors say it keeps things expensive and inaccessible to the traders it’s purportedly trying to reach.  The idea that retail investors might be getting the short end of the stick also raises questions about why the SEC – helmed by the relatively progressive, consumer protections-oriented Gary Gensler – might have approved a bitcoin futures ETF before a contangoless spot ETF.  This interview is part of a series called “Gensler for a Day,” where we ask industry leaders in a position to set or influence law about concrete policies they would implement. Check here for previous “Policy Week” coverage.  Maya Zehavi, a longtime crypto investor and consultant based in Tel Aviv, Israel, put it to me this way:  “There’s a beauty in the irony of a regulator who is trying to crack down on crypto in the name of consumer protection and financial literacy and market manipulation, while actually throwing the retail [traders] in the deep end and telling you, ‘This is kosher, this is fine and safe.’”  Zehavi is the rare crypto investor with a deep aversion to the sort of pseudo-populist rhetoric that permeates the space. She’s also an entrepreneur and executive – her latest project is still in stealth mode. Earlier this week, we spoke at length about the bitcoin futures ETF, and whether crypto can ever outgrow its lawless roots.  Our conversation, edited and condensed for clarity, is below.  What do you feel are the most pressing issues for regulators to home in on?  One, capital raising for U.S.-based projects. Meaning, finding a way where startups can actually raise money, both from private rounds and public rounds, for their tokens, without being at risk for security violations. Until that time where there is a proper safe harbor, regime or something.  The second [thing] is market manipulation. My sense is that they are a lot more focused on trying to regulate stablecoins out of fear that they might be systematic and important to financial market stability, where that framework would actually give them the purview to start or try to regulate protocols that use stablecoins. And I think that’s a big risk, both for decentralized infrastructure and for different DeFi [decentralized finance] instruments.  See also: DeFi Is Like Nothing Regulators Have Seen Before. How Should They Tackle It?  Regulators always like to say that they fear capital controls will let toxic assets or toxic risks spill over across markets. This is actually a case where overregulation might end up impeding crypto markets and innovation. But honestly, I’m just disappointed from the futures ETF. I think that is a perfect case of regulators basically not doing their duty, and in fact impeding protections and obfuscating market costs. So, instead of making it easier for consumers to get into crypto, they ended up putting a much more expensive crypto instrument in the hands of retail, where they’re up against the big dogs trading the futures, versus the spot prices.  Say more about that – you think it would’ve been better to approve a spot ETF first?  Yes, for sure. It’s just a perfect case study of how consumers say one thing, and then [regulators] act as though they have no qualms in basically accentuating the pain that they’re trying to resolve.  It’s more expensive, and they’re more prone to different market structure volatility, and they’re at the hands of whale market manipulation, just in terms of them trading on the volatility. So, you’re not protecting consumers, you’re not giving them cheap access to the asset class. You’re basically putting in more modes for them to enter the market, and requiring more sophistication for them to know what kind of exposure they have, than any other asset class.  That’s the whole story of crypto, right? Smaller fish getting screwed over by the people that know what they’re doing, because there aren’t any protections.  I think sometimes the narrative around crypto is that it disintermediates and democratizes access to finance, and yada yada, when in fact, we’re just creating a lot of other intermediaries and different transactional fees that can or can’t be competitive with traditional finance. And we’re also emulating the same kind of primitive and pretending that it’s a novelty, a lot of time.  But there’s a beauty in the irony of a regulator who is trying to crack down on crypto in the name of consumer protection and financial literacy and market manipulation, while actually throwing the retail [traders] in the deep end and telling you, “This is kosher, this is fine and safe. Like, don’t worry about it, like we’ve gone through all the due diligence.” And basically, you’re endangering retail a lot more than anything else you could have done. Which is just ironic.  You mentioned intermediaries – can government play a role in preventing crypto from replicating the problems in the existing system?  I think instead of taking the paternalistic Elizabeth Warren approach, of thinking you need to be the nanny here, it would be a lot more prudent were regulators to actually try and be the real cop on the market. They need more sticks and not more carrots. So, actually enforce for dumping on retail. Make sure market manipulation is something they’re able to – I hate the word “punish” – but try to rewrite the rules so it doesn’t happen, including on crypto exchanges. And maybe even look at market manipulation within different token sales, and actually say, “We’re willing to be the cop,” instead of, “Oh it’s a security, you’re all in the wrong.”  See also: Some NFTs Are Probably Illegal. Does the SEC Care?  What are some examples of market manipulation in this context?  Outages on Robinhood or on Coinbase or something like that, that’s market manipulation. That’s basically an exchange coming in and saying, “I’m going to stop the free flow of capital so that I’m not on the hook.” That kind of becomes a risk mitigation protocol by exchanges or by centralized intermediaries.  I think the OpenSea scandal is another one of those, the inside information. I think there’s a lot of stuff we know as an industry that we don’t always publicly call out.  Crypto has historically been a home for scammers and pump-and-dump schemes. Do you think the industry can ever escape its association with this sort of “grift economy,” and can regulation play a role there?  Yeah. You see the projects that have withstood the bear market and have managed to deliver. And I think that is almost like a badge of honor saying “this is a good actor.”  [And] I would take a really close look at the funds. If they’re signaling something that is wrong in these pump-and-dumps, if they’re signaling that they’re not going to liquidate their positions, or they’re not going to take a governance role, and they’re pumping or shilling the token or the project, then maybe the person they should be regulating are the funds, and not the project.

The teenager, who was not identified for legal reasons, was arrested in August 2020 following an investigation into reports of credit card fraud and the theft of personal information to defraud a digital gift voucher company out of approximately £6,000 ($8,200).  Links to money laundering through cryptocurrency were discovered later.  The youth appeared in court in the northern English city of Lincoln on Tuesday and was sentenced to service in the community.  “This was a sophisticated cyber fraud and a complex investigation which involved our Cyber Crime Unit working collaboratively with a number of external agencies and other internal departments,” said Cyber Crime Investigator Detective Constable Luke Casey.

42410961,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtkFy,1635334200,The Evolution of Ethereum’s Monetary Policy,"This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Ethereum’s native asset was once discredited by bitcoiners and investors alike for its lack of hard monetary policy and ever-inflationary “tokenomics.” However, the combination of decentralized finance (DeFi), Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 and the coming transition to proof-of-stake has worked to create what ether holders call “Ultra Sound Money.”  Ethresear.ch recently introduced multiple new models to predict the circulating supply of ether after the Merge takes place. To understand their findings and the variables involved in their models, it’s essential to know the following:  Ether is distributed to reward miners for producing blocks under proof-of-work (PoW) and, under Ethereum 2.0, will be used to reward validators for proposing blocks in proof-of-stake (PoS).  EIP 1559 introduced a deflationary mechanism to the network, creating a base transaction fee for utilizing block space on the network and then burning that fee out of existence.  Ethereum 2.0 has an adaptive yield demand curve that attempts to ensure “minimum viable issuance,” or that enough validators are working to secure the network.  Since EIP 1559 was implemented on Aug. 4, 620,000 ETH at a market value of $2.6 billion has been burned through transaction fees. Using that burn rate and the current network demand metrics, Ethresear.ch found that around 2.5% of ether’s circulating supply would be burnt annually. Under proof-of-work, the 2.5% burn only offsets a portion (~39%) of ether’s emission schedule. However, emissions fall drastically post-Merge, potentially even making the asset deflationary.  Going back to Ethereum 2.0′s adaptive yield curve, the blockchain looks to incentivize enough validators to properly secure the network and not any more. Assuming that staking yield falls around 3%, Ethresear.ch’s model predicts that the long-term supply of ether may fall anywhere between 27.3-49.5 million ETH or 23%-42% of today’s supply.  Such a reduction in supply could easily be met with the expectation that ether will be infinitely more scarce than it is today. However, the model requires assuming that demand for blockspace will stay at current levels, which is harder to predict now than ever. Alternative layer 1s continue to grow in popularity, but layer 2 systems built atop Ethereum are just getting started.  Read more: The Success of Ethereum’s Alternative Ecosystems  Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.

Validated takes  Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon is suing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after being served with a subpoena at Messari’s conference last month. BACKGROUND: Do Kwon believes the SEC may have violated its own rules by serving him as a South Korea resident. Furthermore, the founder announced that Terra and Mirror are decentralized and cannot simply be “shut down,” contrary to what regulators might believe.  Polymarket, the largest DeFi predictions market, is said to be under investigation by the Commodities Futures Trading Commision (CFTC). BACKGROUND: Amid a potential billion-dollar funding round, the CFTC is looking into whether Polymarket offered unregulated swaps or binary options. The firm hired the CFTC’s former head of enforcement to deal with the investigation.  A large interoperable Merge developer network is aimed for release during November. BACKGROUND: Eth1 and Eth2 clients came together to launch a test network earlier this month and now aim to release a larger version with further client interoperability. The symbiosis between execution and consensus clients and the creation of successful test networks are positive signs for a successful Merge.  Uniswap has done over $500 billion in trading volume since its inception in November 2018. BACKGROUND: Uniswap is the most popular decentralized exchange on Ethereum Layer 1 and is continuing to expand on Arbitrum and Optimism. According to Token Terminal, the protocol has also returned $1.6 billion in revenue to its liquidity providers.  Decentralized stablecoins have come back to the DeFi spotlight as FXS and SPELL surge in price. BACKGROUND: Regulation of stablecoins and the demand for cheap leverage has led to recent growth in the Maker, Abracadabra and Frax ecosystems, with decentralized stablecoins chipping away at USDT and USDC’s market share.

42424422,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2oVph,1635329953,London Commuters Face Ad ‘Assault’ by New Musk-Inspired Coin: Report,"Advertisements for a meme-based coin named after Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s shiba inu dog have appeared on London’s transportation network in recent weeks.  The Floki Inu coin is being advertised to users of the U.K. capital’s bus and metro network with the slogan “Missed Doge? Get Floki,” the Financial Times reported Wednesday.  A blog post by Floki Inu’s founders last month said the advertising campaign would be “a full-out assault on the London public transportation system.”  The ads are ostensibly attempting to capitalize on interest around cryptocurrency, in particular meme-based crypto like dogecoin, which owes much of its popularity to praise from Musk.  The U.K.’s advertising regulator has previously taken a strict stance on ads that directly instruct consumers to invest in cryptocurrency. In May, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ordered crypto exchange Luno to amend its ads proclaiming “If you’re seeing Bitcoin on the Underground, it’s time to buy.”  It remains to be seen how the ASA will respond to Floki Inu’s ads.  Transport for London, the operator of the capital’s mass transit system, said it is not its “responsibility to carry out due diligence on individuals or entities” that advertise on its network, according to the FT’s report.  Floki Inu, which launched in July, is priced at $0.000058 having hit an record high of $0.00008106 on Oct. 13, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42424435,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2oWBh,1635328130,"Bitcoin Dips Below $59K as Leverage Ratio, SHIB Rally Signal Excess Speculation","Bitcoin is trending down amid signs of excess leverage and greed in the market.  The largest cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands at about $58,900 at press time, representing a 2.3% drop on the day. It is down 12% from last week’s record high of $66,975, CoinDesk 20 data shows.  A pullback was overdue, and more downside volatility could be in the offing, according to analysts. “Estimated leverage ratio is about to hit a year-high. It seems obvious that the market is over-leveraged now,” Ki Young Ju, CEO of data analytics firm CryptoQuant, said. “We’ll see some volatility with huge liquidations shortly.”  The estimated leverage ratio is calculated by dividing futures open interest across all exchanges by bitcoin reserves on exchanges. Open interest refers to the number of contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position.  The ratio essentially shows the degree of leverage of an average investor. While a rising ratio indicates an increased appetite for risk, a very high number reflects excess leverage buildup and marked price tops earlier this year.  The leverage ratio currently stands at 0.19, the highest since last November.  Recent broader market activity, especially the parabolic rise of shiba inu (SHIB), the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer, also points to excess greed often observed at market tops, as CoinDesk warned Sunday.  “Dog coins are mooning again, which has historically been a pretty good indication of an overheated market,” analysts at Delphi Digital said in a market note published on Monday. “The first time dog coins went wild was April – May this year, and quickly cratered as crypto markets cooled off. In early September, dog coins were all the rage again and the broader crypto market saw a fairly deep de-leveraging.”  SHIB clocked a record high of $0.0000595 during Asian trading hours, taking the month-to-date gain to over 600%, Messari data shows. The token has gained 48% this week, courtesy of the SHIB army’s frenzied campaign to get the online brokerage platform Robinhood Markets to add the coin to its platform.  Early today, #shibainu was the top Twitter trend in India, the world’s second-most populous country. A spokesperson from Mumbai-based WazirX, one of the largest crypto exchanges in India, said SHIB has overtaken bitcoin’s position as the top traded token in the Indian rupee market this week, generating a volume of $489 million.  A surge in activity in a highly risky coin like SHIB indicates speculative fervor may be reaching a tipping point. “The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is back to highs we haven’t seen since early March, officially marking ‘Extreme Greed’ levels,” Delphi Digital said in Tuesday’s market update.  Moreover, the optimism generated by the recent launch of futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the bullish mood seems to have waned. The cryptocurrency widely touted as digital gold failed to pick up a bid during the Asian trading hours even though Australia reported core inflation at a six-year high. According to JPMorgan, rising inflation expectations played a big role in pushing bitcoin to new record highs earlier this month.  Bitcoin’s technical picture now supports the case for a deeper pullback. The drop below support at $59,800 has confirmed a head-and-shoulders bearish reversal pattern, exposing support near $54,000.  The sell-off may be much more severe if traditional markets wilt because of the rising odds of a faster scaling back of stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve.",NEGATIVE,SHIB,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/27/bitcoin-dips-below-59k-as-leverage-ratio-shib-rally-signal-excess-speculation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c4e44a669598c9092a747d49ce0241b5b55b0d40-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The World: BTC Leads Sustainable Energy,"Recent reports show that Bitcoin mining uses great amounts of renewable energy due to economic incentives. This turn of events raised their numbers of sustainable power mix to almost three times higher than the world average. As renewable energy offers low costs, bitcoin miners, who had to spend 68.42% of their total income to purchase electricity, have upscaled their efficient use of green energy. A recent data review shows how their mix of sustainable energy is higher than any country or industry. Renewable energy is not flexible and their locations do not tend to be convenient for most people. As bitcoin miners move close to sources of energy to lower the costs, they are a viable solution to not waste the sustainable energy that otherwise would be deployed, as explained by CoinShares. According to a survey carried by the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), the electricity mix used by bitcoin miners increased 3% from second-quarter to an approximate of 57.7% sustainable in third-quarter 2021 &apos;making it one of the most sustainable industries globally.&apos; MicroStrategy&apos;s CEO Michael Saylor had stated earlier that the Bitcoin Mining Council&apos;s effort to bring clarity and transparency over Bitcoin mining will most likely &apos;play an important role in demystifying&apos; the industry. Furthermore, a whitepaper by the Bitcoin Clean Energy Initiative from earlier this year had explained how bitcoin mining, when using renewable energy, &apos;is especially...",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ICO | MINING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-mining-vs-the-world-sustainable-energy/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png
