BTC Is Under Water, While the Metal You Can Hold Is Breathing Air; Cryptos Rebound Sunday","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin Reclaims $20,000; other cryptos rally.

Bitcoin was recently trading at about $20,500, up more than 8% over the previous 24 hours. At one point the previous day, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had fallen below $17,800, its lowest level since mid-December 2017 when Bitcoin was near the peak of a bull run. That dip also fell below the high of that up cycle, disproving a theory that bitcoin would not breach a previous cycle's high watermark.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, followed a similar price pattern, tumbling to an almost five-year low below $1,000 before rising late in the weekend. It was recently changing hands at about $1,120, up more than 13% from the previous day. Other major altcoins were well into the green with LTC and AXS up more than 17% at one point.  ""We had marked $19K-$20K and $16K-$17K as areas of interest, and bitcoin bounced from the latter,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull, wrote to CoinDesk. ""However, unless it successfully maintains $20K with high volumes and bidding, we would not expect the rally to continue.""  The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed an otherwise dreadful week for stocks with a modest 1.4% gain on Friday, while the S&P 500 ticked up a fraction of a percentage point. The S&P, which includes a sizable tech component, tumbled 5.8% for the week and entered bear market territory, meaning that it is down at least 20% from its previous high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell slightly.  Investors remain anxious about high inflation, which reached a 40-year high for May, continued economic fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the increasing likelihood of a global recession. Last Wednesday, the U.S. central bank boosted interest rates by the highest increment in more than a quarter-century – three-quarters of a percentage point – its latest step to stem rising prices. Other central banks have also recently raised rates amid ongoing increases in energy prices.  Meanwhile, crypto markets have also had to digest a series of debacles stretching to early May when the terraUSD stablecoin (UST) collapsed. Last week, cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius announced it was halting withdrawals and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital is facing possible insolvency after incurring at least $400 million in liquidations, according to a report. Coinbase (COIN) and a number of other major digital asset exchanges have also announced steep job cuts. The Fear & Greed Index has been lingering in extreme fear territory for weeks and is now at 6, near its all-time low on a scale of zero to 100.  BitBull's DiPasquale expects volatility in crypto pricing the next few days because of options expiries but he added that ""the macro trend is likely to remain bearish until we see the Federal Reserve changing or at least relaxing its stance in July's FOMC meeting.""  Insights  Analogue Gold Beats Its Digital Version  Bitcoin is called the ultimate store of value by its fans; a digital version of gold that maintains all the best characteristics of it as an inflation hedge while being more efficient and liquid thanks to blockchain technology, which the bitcoin protocol pioneered.  But as crypto faces a harsh winter, perhaps one of the worst on record with major crypto institutions on the verge of failure, faith in this paradigm is being tested.  Indeed, when compared to gold, bitcoin is down more than 55% year to date. Gold, in contrast, is up 2.45%.  And as bitcoin and ether ended the week in Asia attempting a break below $20,000 and $1,000, respectively, data shows the worst might be yet to come.  On-chain data, spotted by CryptoQuant, shows lots of bitcoin is on the move. CryptoQuant’s Ki Young Ju believes it's either crypto hedge funds that are filling up collaterals for long positions or market makers filling up liquidity to execute sell orders for their clients.  “For what it's worth, they're bearish in the short term either way,” he tweeted.  Keep in mind that just over a week ago, bitcoin was at $30,000.

However, they&apos;re keeping their investments low, notwithstanding the current crypto surge sweeping the market. Intertrust Group, a Netherlands-based fund administrator, in its survey of 100 hedge funds, found that hedge funds are aiming to scale their crypto exposure significantly. Chief financial officers worldwide predicted that 7.2% of their assets would be held in cryptocurrencies in the next five years. In order of priority, the primary reasons for interest in the crypto space given by traditional hedge funds were: general diversification, exposure to a new value-creation ecosystem, and hedge against inflation. Strategies by Traditional Funds Investing in Cryptocurrencies Traditional hedge funds investing in cryptocurrencies use fundamental trading, passive approach, and arbitrage as investment strategies. They also use Bitcoin and other cryptos for staking, lending, and borrowing. An increased number of players and liquidity is evolving the crypto derivatives market.

42374606,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw0yLD,1655675914,"Bitcoin Rebounds Past $20K, Ether Soars Above $1,100","Bitcoin surged past $20,000 Sunday afternoon to $20,580 a coin, a 16.9% gain off its Saturday lows.  The rally comes just one day after bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell below $20,000, its lowest price since November 2020. As of press time, bitcoin was trading at about $20,383 a coin.  Bitcoin’s price surge reflects traders’ renewed appetite for risk, even as the market continues to digest the fallout surrounding crypto lending giant Celsius and crypto investment firm Three Arrows Capital.  “Willing buyers have been in cash waiting to buy cheap coins,” Jordi Alexander, chief investment officer of Selini Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “They have to determine if they will get to buy another 20% lower, or if this is their chance. If they wait too long, they will have to chase higher.”  “The key question is whether the forced selling we have seen is wrapping up, or if there are still distressed sellers,” added Alexander.  Early Saturday, the price of bitcoin plummeted below $20,000 and dipped as low as $17,601 later in the trading day. The drop also put bitcoin below the $19,783 all-time high it notched in December 2017, a level many crypto traders believed bitcoin would not fall below.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, enjoyed an even bigger rebound after falling as low as $880 on Saturday. As of press time, ETH was trading at $1,133, a 20% gain over the past 24 hours and a 29% gain off of its Saturday low.

Consequently, the price of other altcoins shot up, including Ethereum and Solana. Fast forward to today, the market faces bear trends. The decline in the price of many cryptocurrencies has led to investors dumping their digital assets. Keeping the current global events in mind, including the Easter Europe war, crypto prices&apos; values have plunged. In turn, it has affected investors who anticipated an appreciation in their assets. However, crypto investors no longer need to rely on bear or bull market trends to gain profits. Crypto provides numerous other opportunities that traders can take advantage of and grow their digital assets. Even during a dip in a bearish market, growing your crypto wealth is possible. There are various uncommon ways crypto investors can benefit from a bear market. They include the following: 1. Buying the Dip using Dollar Cost Averaging It&apos;s easy to be on the wrong side during a wildly volatile market trend in crypto trading. The phrase &apos;Buying the Dip&apos; implies purchasing a number of digital assets during a significant bearish trend. The strategy focuses on the long-term gains that are to be made if the crypto&apos;s price returns to its previous high values.

UST, a stablecoin based on Terra, lost its peg to barely 30 cents in a few hours.

Bitcoin Derivatives Exchange Reserve Observes Sharp Uptrend As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the crashing BTC price may be forcing whales and long-term holders to open short positions in order to hedge their portfolios. The &apos;derivative exchange reserve&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin currently present on wallets of all derivative exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means coins are entering into derivative exchanges right now. Such a trend may mean investors are opening leveraged positions at the moment, which can result in higher volatility in the value of the crypto. On the other hand, a downtrend in the indicator implies investors are withdrawing their coins from these exchanges currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin derivative exchange reserve over the past year: The EMA 7 value of the metric seems to have observed some uptrend recently | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin derivative exchange reserve had been heading down for quite a while, until recently when the indicator&apos;s value once again started rising up.

Davis announced the move in a Sunday Twitter thread, putting to rest any concerns that the Punks’ future would follow a similar path to the Bored Ape Yacht Club.  “If you’re a Punk holder and you care about the legacy/future of the brand I wanna talk one on one,” Davis said in the thread. “I’ll be at the Punks Brunch during NFT NYC and will begin scheduling sit-downs immediately. Wherever Punks go, the community will help guide us.”  The announcement more broadly signals a potential resurgence of Punks back into the NFT sphere. Larva Labs, the project’s original creator, has notably done little to boost the project with partnerships or events.  In a separate thread, a Yuga Lab co-founder said commercial rights for the project will be turned over to its owners in the coming weeks.  Insiders possibly knew of the move before it was made public – plenty of collectors have bought up Punks en masse in the days leading up to the announcement, moving the collection’s floor price up to 66.65 ETH (around $69,000) at the time of writing.  Davis was behind Beeple’s famous “The First 5,000 Days” NFT that sold for $69 million at Christie’s in March 2021. He’s also the lead of the Howlerz NFT project, which he will continue to lead while at his new position at Yuga Labs, according to the thread.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/19/christies-web3-expert-leaves-auction-house-to-run-cryptopunks-for-yuga-labs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79f0e914d755cea000ced1083d92c2085acb7420-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374594,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw0y7N,1655659875,Solana DeFi Platform Votes to Control Whale Account in Bid to Avoid Liquidation 'Chaos',"Users of Solana-based borrowing and lending service Solend voted Sunday to force a takeover of the protocol's largest account: a ""whale"" whose ""extremely large margin position"" was getting, according to Solend contributors, dangerously close to a catastrophic on-chain liquidation cliff.  The unprecedented governance vote, Solend's first, will grant Solend Labs ""emergency powers"" to liquidate the whale's vulnerable assets (around $20 million in SOL) via over-the-counter (OTC) trades instead of decentralized exchanges – where decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidations usually occur – if the price of SOL drops too low.  Solend Labs said on-chain liquidation of the whale's position ""could cause chaos"" in Solana's DeFi markets. Doing so over an OTC service would likely avoid such an outcome. But it also usurps entirely the smart contract–coded protocol Solend programmatically follows for every other borrower liquidation.  Proponents of intervention argued the Solend whale was no typical user. The account had parked 5.7 million SOL onto Solend, or over 95% of the pool's deposits. Against that, it had borrowed $108 million in stablecoins – far more than anyone else.  If the liquidation price of $22.30 SOL hit, it would be liable for around $20 million. SOL is currently trading at $32.27.  ""Despite our efforts, we've been unable to get the whale to reduce their risk, or even get in contact with them,"" the proposal said. ""With the way things are trending with the whale's unresponsiveness, it's clear action must be taken to mitigate risk.""  The proposal asked token holders to yea or nay the following:  Vote Yes: Enact special margin requirements for large whales that represent over 20% of borrows and grant emergency power to Solend Labs to temporarily take over the whale's account so the liquidation can be executed OTC.  Solend governance token-holders who participated voted yea with 97.5% of the vote. The proposal barely cleared a 1% quorum in the affirmative with 1.13% share.  A single yea voter made all the difference: their account was the only reason the proposal cleared the 1% mark.",NEUTRAL,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/06/19/solana-defi-platform-votes-to-control-whale-account-in-bid-to-avoid-liquidation-chaos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a77266875bd5ba03807c057c4d6412491668d63-3622x2717.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It was me. I said that. I went on TD Ameritrade Network to chat crypto, and given the breadth of things I wanted to discuss I’m co-opting that appearance to power the next few newsletters because there wasn’t enough time to cover everything.  I want to cover the big risks as we enter Hard Times in Crypto, now that bitcoin is down over 50% in 2022.

There aren’t many places to hide. Even cash is being gobbled up by 8.6% inflation, according to the U.S. Consumer Price Index. Unless you’re strictly invested in commodities (which you aren’t), your portfolio is probably not having a good time.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Price and macro risk  Bitcoin (BTC) is flirting with price levels that would have been considered highs in December 2017. That was when bitcoin first touched up against $20,000, only to fall precipitously, then scratch and claw for three years to reach $20,000 again by December 2020. Bitcoin’s price has fallen out of the $30,000 range over the last week and it has come dangerously close to breaking down below $20,000.  It might sound painfully obvious to point out that “bitcoin’s price going down is not good,” but … uh … bitcoin’s price going down is not good. This is true for all assets, but it’s especially true for bitcoin.  In late 2020, there was lots of chatter about institutional adoption of bitcoin. Much of the response from institutions was “we can’t take bitcoin seriously until it’s at least a $1 trillion asset.” But then bitcoin did become a $1 trillion asset; so BlackRock (BLK) entered the chat and people started talking about bitcoin as a new type of reserve asset. Counterintuitively, as the value of bitcoin goes up, it becomes more, not less, investable.  Coupled with the price risk is macro risk: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last week signaled a 75 basis point increase to interest rates. And, as expected, the stock market surged.  Except.  That’s literally the opposite of what you’d expect to happen. Perhaps the market was happy that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell called the 75 bps move “unusually large.”  In any event, stocks went up during Powell’s prepared remarks. And so did bitcoin, which I guess is good. But with inflation proving itself a formidable foe and the possibility of recession looming, keeping a close eye on the Fed is critical. It’s important, not only from the angle of assessing if the U.S. can right the ship, but also from crypto’s perspective, given bitcoin’s vascillation from risk-on to risk-off to neither at a moment’s notice. If the world’s biggest economy struggles to recover, that could spell doom or opportunity for bitcoin, depending on how you view it.  Time will tell.  Meanwhile, while trawling through data to back up the notion that interest rate increases should lead to lower stock prices I came across something interesting. Looking at the 30-day correlation of bitcoin to 10-year U.S. Treasury yields and the Nasdaq to 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, these relationships have been scattered in the second quarter. These correlations moved from somewhat negative to somewhat positive correlation and moved sharply toward somewhat negative in the last few weeks.  When Treasury yields go up, that’s either because interest rates have increased or demand for Treasurys has fallen. This might be counterintuitive, but in order to get someone to buy a Treasury the seller would have to sell it for less if fewer people want it, which increases the yield (since yield takes the price you paid for the instrument into account). Higher interest rates mean that investors could get higher interest on Treasurys from the government, so they’ll pay less for already issued Treasurys with lower interest rates.  All said, given we are in a rising interest rate environment, I expected this relationship to be negative. At least, I expected it to be consistent. As yields go up because of increased interest rates, risk-on assets like stocks (and sometimes bitcoin) should go down. Perhaps investors remain unconvinced that we are headed toward a recession so yields are up because of suppressed demand for Treasurys. Maybe investors believe that a supply-driven economic slowdown will prove less potent than a demand-driven one.  My take is that markets were expecting higher interest rate hikes and signaling that more heavy hikes were on the way, so the previously priced-in doomsday scenario was undone after the announcement.  Like I said above: Time will tell.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/19/hard-times-in-crypto-lead-to-price-and-macro-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68ac9718565c821312c77715688b0bd49fc25acf-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Still, TOMO bears are in control until there is a conclusive close above $0.40 with rising trading volumes. Past Performance of TomoChain Amid a crypto bear onslaught, TOMO crypto is steady, soaking in selling pressure in the past trading day. The token is up by six percent and is firm against the USDT. From the daily chart, bears are still in control, although there is a higher high relative to the lower BB. The primary support remains at $0.40, flashing with June 16 lows.

In the short term, a close above $0.48 could jolt demand, forcing TOMO bulls into action. A close above this liquidation level with rising trading volumes may push the coin towards $0.70 as prices bottom up. If not, losses below $0.40 with rising volumes could see prices align with losses of June 10 through 13 towards $0.23 in a bear trend continuation pattern. What to Expect from TOMO? Sellers are firm, but there are attempts of higher high. The immediate support line is at $0.40.

42374598,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw0yCP,1655640000,Luna Only Makes Bermuda Love Stablecoins More,"AUSTIN, Texas — The collapse of Terra’s terraUSD (UST) made some investors think twice about buying stablecoins. The algorthmic stablecoin, pegged to the U.S. dollar, turned out to be less than stable, and investors in stablecoins as a whole were spooked about being left with nothing.  It’s the exact opposite way of thinking for Bermuda’s premier, David Burt. He said in an interview the Terra debacle highlights the importance of good regulation, vindicating his goal of making his country the world’s home for safe, innovative assets.  The recent dramatic loss of terraUSD’s dollar peg “is a validation of the approach that we've taken,” Burt told CoinDesk during the recent Consensus 2022 conference here.  “What Bermuda wants to be is the hub of the global stablecoin market, where it is issued under a regulated environment so investors and citizens can have confidence,” he said. “There are stablecoins, but then there are regulated stablecoins.”  He first told CoinDesk about his aims for crypto regulation during a ""Money Reimagined"" podcast in October 2020. Last week, it was announced that Bermuda had issued its first digital asset banking license to locally-based institution Jewel Bank, representing the first new bank license of any kind issued by Bermuda in 21 years.  ""Money Reimagined"": Bermuda Will Skip the Age of CBDCs, With Premier David Burt  It’s been a long wait, but Burt hopes people will take that as a sign of the nation's thoroughness and credibility and be confident the Bermuda Monetary Authority has done its homework to protect hard-earned savings.  “Our regulator has responsibility to ensure that in breaking this new ground [involving stablecoins] all the risk has been assessed,” he said. “That might take longer, but you will know that we go through an incredibly thorough process.”  Jewel  In addition to being a bank, Jewel plans to issue a U.S. dollar-linked stablecoin in the fall of this year for use in wholesale financial markets, potentially followed one pegged to the Bermudian dollar and then other currencies.  “Digital assets broadly are going to change the way in which the world operates,” Burt said. “We believe that is certainly going to be the future, and we want Bermuda to be the home of innovation.”  Jewel’s CEO agrees it’s not been an easy process – although Nick Lepetsos stressed that, as a bank-issued, fully reserved asset, its proposed stablecoin has a much more robust model than Terra’s algorithmic version.  Lepetsos told CoinDesk the procedure to secure Jewel's license included a grueling set of questions about the company’s expertise, capital and reason for existing – far from the cartoon view of “going to the DMV, the Department of Motor Vehicles, where you just sign up and get in line and you wait a while, and you get your license,” he said.  Read more: Jewel Bank Approved as Bermuda's First Digital Asset Bank as Premier Burt Readies to Take Nation Into Stablecoins  While long a major financial center, Bermuda’s a tiny territory – and business models like Jewel’s will depend on being able to reach bigger markets in places like the U.S.  Tax haven  But Burt doesn’t seem worried about the prospect of being shut out.  European Union lawmakers considering the bloc’s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) have proposed that crypto providers should be barred from serving European markets if they operate from known tax havens. That could potentially include places like Bermuda, which was added to an EU “graylist” of noncooperative tax jurisdictions in February.  The European Commission has urged a rethink of plans it says could breach international trade law. But even if an EU blacklist does emerge for territories with sloppy crypto rules, Burt doesn’t seem worried.  “I would say that if they were to do that type of ranking, Bermuda would probably be at the top of the list,” he said. However, when it comes to regulation, “We know how to do this stuff, and so we have no fear about what may come.”  Read more: EU Ban on Tax-Haven Crypto Firms Could Breach Trade Law, Commission Warns",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/19/luna-only-makes-bermuda-love-stablecoins-more,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba42b4fd819257c1ead9f635057e34590e0745c5-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
