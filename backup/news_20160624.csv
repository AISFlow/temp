The price of bitcoin approached $800, the looming 'Brexit' vote, the latest developments surrounding the collapse of The DAO and a trading outage at exchange Bitfinex all helped fuel these sharp price fluctuations.  When the week began on 17th June, bitcoin was trading at nearly $770, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal. However, the digital currency failed to ""break through $800 and looked slightly overbought in the high $700s,"" said Athur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin leverage trading platform BitMEX.  Over the next several trading sessions, bitcoin prices would fall sharply.  Ether suffered even sharper declines, and more than one market observer identified issues surrounding the smart contract-based funding vehicle The DAO as being the single greatest cause of this depreciation.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, said The DAO's loss of tens of millions of dollars worth of ether was ""the main driver behind ETH's current price swings,"" while Xu Qing, spokesperson for Huobi, described the event as the ""primary cause"" of ether’s price fluctuation.  Ether enjoyed highly robust trading activity during the week, with trading volume setting an all-new record during one session.  Bitcoin’s downward momentum  Bitcoin prices suffered an 18.6% week-over week decline, BPI data shows, while ether plunged 32% during this period, according to Poloniex figures.  While bitcoin started the week off at $768.24 on 17th June, it fell to a closing value of $631.72 at 19:40 UTC on 21st June.  This gradual decline took place amid a short squeeze, as ""many traders opened longs above the $700 level and the ensuing price dumps forced them out of their positions,"" Zivkovski told CoinDesk.  As falling prices forced speculators to close out their long positions, long exposure – as measured by position size – fell from 92% on 17th June to 65% on the 21st, additional Whaleclub figures show.  Bitcoin prices did enjoy some brief rallies during the week, rising to $678.22 between 12:45 and 12:59 UTC on 22nd June after nearing $630 the day before, according to the BPI.  The digital currency experienced another brief rise the following day, climbing to $597.80 at 07:30 UTC on 23rd June after falling to $551.92 at 1:30 UTC the same day. The currency experienced some more gyrations before opening on the 24th at $625.49.  While bitcoin fell nearly 18% in less than four sessions, ether plunged more than 50% in roughly 48 hours, dropping from an opening price of $20.50 on 17th June to $8.56 at 12:35 UTC on 18th June, according to Poloniex data.  Market participants traded $199.4m worth of ether on 17th June, CoinMarketCap figures show. This figure was more than three times the previous record of $65.3m set in March.  The following day, trading volume for ether was $132m.  DAO dilemma  The week's volatile trading activity took place as the ongoing situation surrounding The DAO continued to develop. To recap, the Ethereum-based project lost more than 3m ethers following an exploit of its smart contract code, an event that came after the initiative collected more than $150m in ether during a crowdsale.  In an effort to secure some of the lost funds, a group of ethereum developers launched a white hat attack in a bid to secure investor holdings. However, the distributed organization’s code was once again exploited, and as it stands ethereum's development community is currently weighing a network change that has drawn divided opinions thus far.  In spite of these challenges, the price of ether recovered to $13.91 by the end of the week.  ""I’ve been surprised at how well ether has weathered The DAO hack,"" ARK Invest’s Chris Burniske told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Certainly, it’s down significantly from its $20+ highs, but given the gravity of a potential hard fork I think the cryptocurrency is holding up remarkably well.""  Brexit  One major event that generated substantial visibility during the week was the Brexit vote. Britons flocked to the polls on 23rd June, participating in an event that drew a global audience.  During this time up to the vote, market experts repeatedly pointed to anticipation for the decision as affecting market sentiment, and therefore digital currencies.  When bitcoin prices fell below $600 on 23rd June and almost hit $550, investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham, Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund and Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin leverage trading platform BitMEX all cited the impending 'Brexit' vote as causing the currency to fall 15% in five hours.  “It’s remarkable how closely bitcoin has ‘inversely tracked’ Brexit news over the last few days,” Burniske told CoinDesk. ""It seems the markets are awakening to cryptocurrency as an asset class to be reckoned with, and due to its historically low correlation of returns, are using it as a ‘disaster hedge’ in times of capital market turmoil.""  Yet, as it became clear that the UK was going to vote to leave the EU, bitcoin prices surged sharply, breaking $650 as the final results rolled in.  The vote's outcome also triggered sharp declines in the world's major stock markets.  What does this mean for the future of digital currency? And has it secured its place as a 'safe haven' asset? As recent reports show, only future trading sessions will decide.  Charles L. Bovaird II is a financial writer and consultant with strong knowledge of securities markets and investing concepts.

42378790,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lkXX,1466799509,"Needham: 'Brexit' Boosts Bitcoin Price, But Too Early to Call it a Safe Haven","Despite the increase in the price of bitcoin amid the UK’s recent EU referendum, a new research note from Needham & Company asserts it might be too early to call the digital currency a “safe haven” asset.  Global bitcoin prices have risen nearly 6% over the day’s trading to reach a high of $680, a figure up more than $100 from a low of $561.46 on 23rd June. Market observers were quick to assert the increase, which occurred as sentiment in the 'Brexit' vote shifted, was a sign this uncertainty had encouraged new investment in the digital currency markets.  However, Needham said its researchers are ""hesitant"" to call bitcoin a safe haven alongside gold, US Treasurys, yen and USD.  The note reads:  ""For one, calling it such obfuscates the fact that bitcoin is a high-risk and volatile investment and, second, bitcoin's correlation to other traditional safe-haven assets has fluctuated significantly.""  Still, Needham called the ‘Brexit’ a positive for the digital currency market, as it shows that bitcoin has the potential to rally around marcoeconomic uncertainty and on developments within its own technical ecosystem.  “On the one hand, bitcoin is performing like a safe-haven asset but, on the other hand, its newness and dynamism do not resemble US Treasurys or gold,” the note reads.  Ultimately, the note concludes bitcoin might not fit into any existing asset definitions, concluding:  ""We believe that bitcoin is something entirely different that does not fit into the normal buckets that investments are typically bracketed into.""

42378792,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lka3,1466787021,31 Chinese Firms Form Financial Blockchain Consortium,"Chinese financial services firm Ping An Bank and a subsidiary of QQ instant message app maker Tencent are among more than 30 technology and financial firms in China that have formed a new consortium dedicated to blockchain tech.  The Financial Blockchain Shenzhen Consortium was officially launched on 31st May during an event in Shenzhen, a development that marks the latest business alliance to collectively explore applications of the technology. Ping An itself is a member of the R3-led consortium of global financial institutions, and in the past year and a half, working organizations have formed around securities settlement and capital markets use cases.  In addition to Ping An and the Tencent subsidiary, the 31-member strong group features a wide spectrum of finance and tech firms. Areas of focus among its membership include capital markets technology, securities exchange, trading platforms, life insurance and banking – all of which have been identified as potential areas for applying blockchain tech.  Its members say the group has several mandates. Beyond providing a forum for communication and information-sharing, participating companies will collaborate on research and the creation of group-wide blockchain projects focused on finance use cases.  Specific plans are said to include the development of a prototype for a securities trade platform and exploration of services for offering credit, digital asset registry and invoice management.  Ping An group chief innovation officer Daniel Tu positioned his company’s participation through the lens of financial innovation.  Tu told CoinDesk:  ""We wish to take advantage of this opportunity to collaborate with local financial and Internet companies and contribute to the exploration of blockchain in China.""  The May meeting reportedly focused on electing officers to lead the consortium as well as laying out the basis for its structure, which will include joint task forces focused on various areas of research and proof-of-concept development.  The group is the second organization of its kind to emerge in China. Launched in early May, the ChinaLedger Alliance is backed by nonprofit research outfit Wanxiang Blockchain Labs and includes ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and R3 researcher Tim Swanson as advisors.  More recent moves, including an expansion into China by payments startup Circle and the pending acquisition of bitcoin mining chip seller Canaan (known more commonly known as Avalon) by a Shenzhen-based electronics firm, suggest that the country is likely to see more growth on the bitcoin and blockchain front in the months ahead.

42378793,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lkYn,1466771414,The DAO Shows Blockchain Can't Code Away Social Problems,"Everyone loved The DAO. They couldn’t say enough about how it was going to change the future for the better.  And now, after the code-based crowdfunding platform was exploited with a perpetrator taking 3.6 million ether (valued at $60m at the time), The DAO has become the red-headed stepchild of the cryptocurrency community.  It’s a recognition that these new technologies are not all rainbows and revolution.  Technology has holes and gaps, negative impacts – both intended and unintended, and possible complications the industry must be cognizant of before telling people to sink their life savings into these startup projects.  The beneficial parts of The DAO have been discussed again and again; there’s no shortage of attention being paid to this distributed crowdfunding platform. It points to a more collaborative economy; for us, by us, like bitcoin.  Now there is talk that The DAO might be finished. The project might fail and along with that the hopes for ethereum as well.  I doubt it, but the community will have to start looking for ways to tackle the social issues that arise even with technologically superior platforms.  Votes as reputation  Because DAO tokens represent votes, users with the most tokens will have the most votes. At its core, this gives wealthier individuals more sway over decisions at the disadvantage of those in lower socioeconomic brackets, which could even stand to benefit more from advances in technology.  To be fair, early adopters bought into The DAO at 100 DAO tokens per ether (this payout declined over time), and as more people invested in the project, the value per token rose as well, leaving people up on their investment.  But early adopters do tend to be affluent, with more education, larger incomes and higher standards of living.  While The DAO gets labeled revolutionary more often than not, this income-based reputation is how the current political system works, and many are finding it appalling as the income gap widens.  As we’ve seen, this isn’t always the best process for the most constituents.  Silicon Valley provides a useful example, as venture capitalists throw enormous amounts of money at entrepreneurial projects they don’t know the details about. Sure, they have to take a risk on certain companies and business models, and that ultimately leads to some failures, but the rate of this is outrageous.  Plus, there are startups that would like to build technological solutions for the disenfranchised, but many of these projects have trouble getting funded since these users don’t provide a very profitable future return.  The problem with putting decision-making in the venture capital community’s hands is that its constituents typically come from similar backgrounds, meaning they won’t necessarily make good decisions for a broader swath of society.  This is highlighted in a Medium article called “The DAO: How to Not Fuck it Up” where Peter Thiel’s seven key questions to evaluating startups are mentioned, and not one of these questions asks whether consumers want or even need the products or services the startup is pitching.  This idea of using tokens as indicators of reputation for voting is also potentially harmful for next-generation social media platforms.  For instance, Steemit wants to create a social networking site where positive and accurate information is dispersed, but those adjectives are dependent on people voting. For sites that hope to gain momentum from cryptocurrency enthusiasts first, this could mean biased posts on the advantages of cryptocurrency get upvoted, while information about its flaws or weaknesses get downvoted or ignored, thus burying those stories for other users.  These projects highlight why attaching a monetary token to something like a vote can be problematic. Because money is a sought-after good, conflicts of interest and volatility can quickly arise.  For example, since creators of projects seeking funding can purchase DAO tokens, they might be more interested in putting all their votes towards their own proposal, instead of dispersing the funds based on what projects actually deserve investment.  A commenter on a recent CoinDesk report posted that The DAO is the final piece open-source projects have been looking for – ""financial support for great ideas"" – but the question remains, who decides what are great ideas?  Informed voters  The other issue that can emerge is that some token-holders will be ill-informed about the things they’re voting on. Again, another problem that already plagues systems today.  Speaking to Reuters, Stephen Tual, founder of Slock.it, the startup that wrote the code for The DAO, said:  ""The DAO appeals to people who are tired of centralized projects where they have no say.”  But even within centralized projects, participants have some say. At the company level, shareholders push founders in certain directions, and within the current democratic political processes, most people get a vote.  Even if their preferred candidate doesn’t win, they can change the conversation.  People in the current system feel they have no say because the system has become so complex, convoluted and filled with barriers to entry. This current disillusionment is furthered by policy issues that are far more nuanced than the approval or disapproval choices people get to cast their ballot for.  Coding everything  The idea that technologists can code every human interaction is a popular one.  Maybe the human brain is a “computer” that acts depending on environmental stimulus which may one day be coded into a rule set. But I’d argue those cause and effect relationships are too intricate for code to handle.  Just putting a problem on a blockchain or into a decentralized system doesn’t necessarily provide a solution. If the process is still complex and convoluted, the system continues to have the same problems that our current, more centralized systems have.  Although, if done correctly (big caveat), decentralization does help eliminate the corruption of suppressing movements since the process typically strips one person or small groups of people from powerful authority positions.  With the recent DAO ""attack"", the Ethereum team has stepped back into that authority position – whether you believe rightfully so or not – to stop the “attacker” from moving the funds in the sub-DAO account and reversing the transactions to get DAO tokens back to its original owners.  This is seemingly at odds with the immutability the project touted, but acts as an example of why un-coded exceptions are sometimes needed.

Though there were suggestions the volatility could be tied to any number of recent indicators, at press time, ongoing macroeconomic concerns in Europe seem to be the most influential factor, as the price of bitcoin began to rise amid reports that the UK appears increasingly likely to leave the European Union.  The UK’s ongoing EU membership referendum, in which voters were asked whether the country should stay (‘Bremain’) or leave (‘Brexit’) the European Union, has coincided with the increase in the price of bitcoin from a low of $560 just hours prior to a press time high of $655.63.  With 54.5% of the vote tallied at press time, data from the UK Telegraph indicated 51.4% of voters had voiced their support for a ‘Brexit’, with just 48.6% siding for ‘Bremain’.  This shifting sentiment that was also increasingly broadcast by bitcoin evangelists on Twitter, along with suggestions the price increase was tied to the latest news.
