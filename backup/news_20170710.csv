42379581,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYkN,1499727613,Blockchain Startup Provenance Raises $800k in Seed Funding,"UK blockchain startup Provenance has raised $800,000 in new seed funding.  The list of investors taking part in the round includes Humanity United, a foundation created in 2008 as part of a broader philanthropic network of groups backed by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife, Pam. Specifically, the group provided the funding through a supply chain initiative launched in 2015.  Other backers of the startup include Alexsis de Raadt-St.James, founder of Merian Ventures, startup accelerator Plug and Play Tech Center, investment firm Digital Currency Group, and a group of UK-based angel investors.  In statements, the startup said that it planned to use the funding to fuel its product launch timeline, with initiatives set to be released this fall. Among those efforts: a partnership with the UK-based charity Soil Association through its Organic September project, which is aimed at expanding the size of the country's organic food market.  ""This funding will help us develop our tools to meet the business need for more trustworthy supply chains whilst empowering shoppers to make a positive impact,"" Provenance CEO Jessi Baker said of the round.  Provenance has been working on supply chain solutions since it was first formed in 2013. A number of major firms worldwide, including China's Alibaba and ZhongAn, have explored applications in this area.

42379579,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYhr,1499717711,Publicly Traded Bitcoin Startup BTCS Reveals Plan to Invest in ICOs,"Publicly traded bitcoin startup BTCS is planning to create a portfolio of digital assets, its chief executive told shareholders in a new letter.  In the letter, released today, CEO Charles Allen wrote that the firm would invest in initial coin offerings, or ICOs, through which cryptographic tokens tied to a particular blockchain platform or application are sold. It's a funding mechanism that has attracted significant interest among both startups, investors and would-be buyers, though regulatory and ethical concerns have been raised about the model in the past.  Allen indicated that BTCS, which is publicly traded as a pink sheet at OTCQB, would invest in blockchain tokens through ICOs as well as direct market purchases and mining.  Though the company had previously suspended its mining activities – it reported a robbery last September which resulted in the theft of 165 mining computers – BTCS indicated that it may resume mining through third-party sources.  Those plans, the letter goes on to acknowledge, are incumbent on the raising of more money.  Allen explained:  ""Moving forward, subject to the completion of additional financing, we plan to create a portfolio of digital assets, through participation in initial coin offerings, strategic market purchases, and by resuming our transaction verification services business, through outsourced data centers. We are also keenly focused on the potential acquisition of target opportunities across the blockchain space.""  As previously reported by CoinDesk, BTCS raised $1m early last month in an equity sale. Allen wrote that this sale was undertaken ""to settle liabilities and provide working capital"". That move came as part of a broader restructuring process that played out in the past year.  The startup first revealed its digital asset portfolio plans to prospective investors starting in February. That was before the start of what some observers are calling a bubble in cryptocurrency markets.

42400133,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc24CY,1499708112,Mt Gox CEO's Embezzlement Trial Begins Tomorrow,"The chief executive of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox is set to appear in court this week.  According to reports from AP and AFP, CEO Mark Karpeles will appear in a Tokyo court on Tuesday. Arrested and charged in 2015 with embezzlement and data manipulation, Karpeles was released on bail just under a year ago.  Mt Gox  was once the world's most voluminous bitcoin exchange, capturing the majority of the globe's bitcoin trade, before it collapsed in early 2014 amid allegations of fraud and mismanagement. The company behind the exchange remains in bankruptcy, and is the focus of a years-long claims process.  It was Mt Gox's collapse, in part, that triggered a broad government initiative that led to the creation of a legal framework for regulating bitcoin exchanges as well as the recognition of the digital currency as a kind of electronic payment method. Those efforts began in the months after Mt Gox's closure.  AFP reports that, per his attorney, Karpeles is expected to plead innocent when the trial gets underway tomorrow. If convicted, Karpeles faces as many as five years in prison.  ""He is keeping calm as the trial gets underway,"" Kiichi Iino, who is representing Karpeles, told the publication.

42400134,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc24BZ,1499700657,"$20,000: IRS to Exempt Casual Bitcoin Buyers From Coinbase Data Request","The Internal Revenue Service is seeking a narrower focus in its investigation of digital currency startup Coinbase, new court documents reveal.  Perhaps most notable, according to the July 6 notice, is the fact that the IRS is only trying to obtain records on users who have conducted ""at least the equivalent of $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year during the 2013-2015 period"".  This suggests that the tax authority – which began pushing for more information in November – may be looking to prioritize data related to more frequent users of the startup's services.  News reports last week revealed that the IRS was moving to limit the scope of the summons it wants to serve on Coinbase. According to Fortune, the agency said it wouldn't seek information related to account security.  The filing from last week goes into greater detail, outlining how the IRS will not seek information on users ""who only bought and held bitcoin during the 2013-2015 period"", as well as users for whom the startup filed 1099-K forms in those years.  Additionally, ""certain users known to the Internal Revenue Service"" will also be excluded, a list of whom – which wasn't disclosed in the filing"" that will be provided to Coinbase at some future date, according to the filing.  Narrower scope aside, the IRS indicated that it could ultimately seek more information on the users in question, writing that it may still ""issue summonses in individual examinations of Coinbase users for the information that it no longer seeks in this proceeding"".  The filing is the latest legal twist in the long-running IRS effort to obtain user information from Coinbase. The tax agency's effort has run into headwinds, with pushback coming from both the startup itself as well as some of its users.  In March  , the IRS asked a federal court to compel Coinbase to turn over the records, and last week's filing resulted from that case. A pair of unnamed Coinbase users filed a motion to intervene in that case in May in an attempt to stop the summons from being executed.  The IRS effort, as might be expected, has sparked a broad outcry from both digital currency advocates as well as users of the tech. The agency's strategy has also come under scrutiny from both its government watchdog as well as Congress.

42400149,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc24MO,1499695235,"IBM, Westpac and More Trial Blockchain for Bank Guarantees","A group of Australia-based companies have announced the completion of a blockchain trial aimed at digitizing the bank guarantee process for commercial property leasing.  A collaboration with IBM, Westpac, shopping centre operator Scentre Group and ANZ, the group reports it was able to successfully apply distributed ledger technology (DLT) to eliminate the need for current paper-based bank guarantee documents. The participants have released a white paper detailing how the solution worked and how they believe it could be used in other situations that rely on bank guarantees.  Commenting on the successful trial, Mark Bloom, chief financial officer at Scentre Group, said:  ""An update of the decades-old process for issuing, tracking and claiming on guarantees is long overdue. With approximately 11,500 retailers across Australia and New Zealand, who use guarantees to support rental obligations, manual tracking of guarantees has been an extremely cumbersome and labour intensive process.""  In addition to eliminating the need for physical document management, Westpac said that the trial also addressed other inefficiencies in the current bank guarantee process, including the challenges in tracking and reporting of a guarantee's status through multiple changes.  Overall, it's the latest sign that Australia is building up its research and development on blockchain technology. Last month, the Australian government published two blockchain research studies, and in April, public records showed that Australia's central bank is involved with several initiatives focused on blockchain tech.

42400143,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc24FV,1499691611,"ConsenSys, Nation of Mauritius in Talks to Create 'Ethereum Island'","Ethereum startup ConsenSys is actively exploring a partnership with the African nation of Mauritius that could create a so-called ""Ethereum Island,"" a hub for blockchain technology innovators that would seek to branch out into Africa, Asia and beyond.  Joseph Lubin, founder, and a team of other top executives from ConsenSys – the New York-based decentralized application builder – toured the island July 5–7 to meet with the nation's Board of Investment, the Bank of Mauritius and other private and public sector authorities.  Mauritius, located 700 miles east of Madagascar, has established itself as an offshore financial center and is actively looking to do same with regard to blockchain and related technologies. Late last year, it began the process of establishing a regulatory sandbox license in an effort to attract blockchain innovators.  Speaking to local press following the meetings, Lubin remarked that he and his team were impressed by the knowledge and enthusiasm for the technology exhibited by local officials.  Lubin said:  ""We expected to encounter significant enthusiasm… but we were overwhelmed with the excitement that we felt in every single meeting. If Mauritius puts together a concerted effort to be a world leader, it will be.""  James Duchenne, the Mauritius Board of Investment's US representative, who helped to organize the tour, added that there has been strong interest in the regulatory sandbox license from the blockchain community since its announcement.  Why Mauritius?  So, why is ConsenSys, a name-brand and fast-growing blockchain solutions company so keen to potentially set up shop on a small island on the other side of the world?  The key reason, Lubin explained, is that he and his team have discovered that smaller nations have the tools and nimbleness needed to adapt and embrace new technologies at a more rapid clip than larger jurisdictions.  ""We have noted around the world that blockchain technology, especially ethereum, is catching on and driving incredible business growth,"" Lubin said.  He continued:  ""But where we're seeing extreme traction is in smaller jurisdictions that are more homogeneous in their focus and in their intent, and where there's a strong top-down drive from government to either leapfrog technologies or take advantage of this powerful technology.""  In ConsenSys's estimation, Mauritius meets all of these criteria and has the potential to quickly turn into a home base for blockchain companies seeking to branch out around the world.  ""It's clear that… there's real buy-in to the vision of turning Mauritius into a blockchain technology hub,"" he said. ""We believe that the vision we’ve seen demonstrated here will enable this nation to be in the forefront of this change wave in how information technology systems are built.""  Human capital investment  Should Consensys decide to partner with Mauritius, the investment it would bring to the island nation would be more in the area of human than physical capital.  The company said that its value proposition to the island would be in establishing foundational elements of a blockchain ecosystem – such as know your customer rules, digital identity and title registries, and then helping to build a talent pool of developers, entrepreneurs, executives and regulators to build applications and companies within that ecosystem.  A Mauritius-based ConsenSys Academy, similar to the one launched in Dubai in May, was floated as a possible option for helping to build up the local talent base.  ""If discussions continue at the pace they have the past few days, I could easily see us running another ConsenSys Academy program in Mauritius,"" said Jeremy Millar, chief of staff for ConsenSys.  No timetable for a final deal was provided, but both sides expressed strong interest in continuing and advancing the conversation.

42400155,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc24TH,1499688621,Bitcoin + Post-Trade? Nivaura Exits Stealth to Help Banks Use Open Blockchains,"Until today, all that was publicly known about Nivaura was its presence in some rather elite blockchain incubators – ranging from JP Morgan's in-residence program to two terms in the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s regulatory sandbox.  But it turns out the little-known startup based on Liverpool Street in London, has been doing a lot more than just hobnobbing with bulge bracket banks and building proofs-of-concept.  As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Nivaura has formed key partnerships with banks and others in the financial markets space, and has been granted what it described as ""restricted"" permission from the UK regulator to execute the process of issuing financial instruments and administering them after their release.  If successful, the series of experiments (which includes its work holding client money and assets) would amount to what the startup calls a ""self-service for capital markets"" that could dramatically compress the complicated vertical processes now in place.  But what truly sets apart the work isn't the FCA access or the partnerships with Tier 1 Investment Bank, Metro Bank, Microsoft, Moody’s and more. The real difference here is that while many of Nivaura's competitors insist that a private blockchain is necessary to comply with privacy and transparency regulations, this startup is building its capital markets solutions on the two best-known public blockchains.  Nivaura CEO and chief architect Avtar Sehra – a former theoretical physicist – explained to CoinDesk in detail why the FCA permissions were crucial to demonstrating that the bitcoin blockchain and the public ethereum blockchain can accomplish what is widely believed can only be done on a permissioned blockchain.  Sehra said:  ""They gave us restricted permissions so we can arrange the deals and execute the deals and hold client assets and money, and we've got a client money account to do this. We did the first issuance, and we've shown that what we’re doing can work.""  Who needs a smart contract?  To create its market for issuing and administering securities, ranging from debt and equities to more complicated vehicles, Sehra and his team told CoinDesk they have been granted modified MiFID and CASS approvals from the FCA.  But still they had to overcome one key regulatory hurdle: an independent third party is required to reconcile any assets traded or sold. The middleman is legally mandated, or so it would seem.  However, Sehra believes that by reimagining the independent third party, or registrar, as a public blockchain, he could save clients up to 15 percent on costs, and for the past year the firm has been testing that theory.  In November 2016, Nivaura was one of nine startups added to the FCA's newly created regulatory sandbox, a space where innovative companies can experiment on the fringes of finance without concern that the regulator would come crashing down on them for drawing outside the lines.  The technology itself consists of two main components: First is a platform layer that is essentially a document-tracking system complete with KYC (""know your customer"") functionality that employs Nivaura’s own legal markup language for completing agreements. Second is a ""blockchain agnostic"" connectivity layer that has been tested on both the public ethereum blockchain and the bitcoin blockchain.  What's important is that, up until this point, the functionality that compresses the middlemen out of existence isn’t reliant on the distributed ledger at all. Rather, it is a series of ""very simple elements of data,"" as Sehra described them, such as who is the issuer and how many units of an asset are being created?  Only at the very end of the carefully constructed work flow is the asset moved on the blockchain.  While the smart contract languages associated with ethereum make that process easier from a development perspective, they are not necessary, said Sehra. In the case of bitcoin, the assets exist in bitcoin’s ""OP_Return"" – a field set aside for basic messages that have no impact on the blockchain’s mining process.  ""We created a system that can execute the transactions and record them on the OP_Return on bitcoin,"" said Sehra. ""It’s a metadata solution, and the metadata is essentially saying you can create assets on the OP_Return by constructing the transaction, deploying it.""  A new kind of investment bank  That Nivaura's assets are custodied on the bitcoin and ethereum blockchain instead of a registrar makes the startup a bit like an investment bank. The main difference being that the owners of the assets have their own key to the vault in the form of a private key for each bond, debt issuance, etc.  To pull off such a potential paradigm shift, in which capital markets are essentially turned into a high-stakes vending machine, Nivaura has already gathered a host of partners, including multiple banks, which could eventually become their customers, and one registrar that could potentially be disrupted.  For the tests in the second sandbox (which begins next month), Sehra breaks down the work – like any good physicist – into a control case and a test case.  For the control case, Nivaura operates like a traditional, centralized registrar, and even recruited one of the largest registrars in Europe, Capita Asset Services – which administers £600bn-worth of assets for 6 million investors – to custody the funds.  But Capita also helped with the test case, working with Nivaura to create a standard set of documents and agreements that can be executed using the startup’s legal language. Law firm Allen & Overy LLP, at which Nivaura will be the first entrepreneurs in residence beginning in September, helped ensure that the documents execute the work flow in a legally compliant way.  To ensure the contracts themselves are populated with reliable data, Nivaura has partnered with Moody’s to provide information about pricing and the likelihood of default based on historical trends. Further, both cloud storage and blockchain services were provided via Microsoft Azure’s blockchain-as-a-service toolkit.  Capita's director of asset services, Peter Walker, explained that the compression of so many layers of capital markets service into a single system has the potential to open the investment vehicles to those who otherwise couldn't afford them.  In a statement provided to CoinDesk, Walker said:  ""Perhaps most significantly, Nivaura's platform facilitates the implementation of policy initiatives to open debt capital markets to SMEs. Thereby diversifying the supply of credit for that sector; the 'engine room' of many national economies.""  Raising capital  So far, Nivaura’s progress has come largely with the financial support of its founding team, but that is about to change.  Last year Goldman Sachs predicted that blockchain could save capital markets $6bn a year, and, last February, a report by financial infrastructure provider Euroclear and law firm Oliver Wyman estimated that the first live implementations would be implemented by as soon as this August.  In the race to take the lead in this burgeoning ecosystem, Nivaura board member Alan Morgan of MMC Ventures has led a seed round that just closed for an undisclosed amount, with participation by Digital Currency Group and other individual investors.  As the company grows, Sehra says that assets based in bitcoin and ether could end up being only the beginning.  He concluded:  ""We're building the system so we can actually denominate instruments in a currency that is also on a blockchain. At the moment we're using bitcoin and ether, but in the future it might be [British pounds] on a blockchain.""

42400158,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc24RJ,1499684361,No Joke: Blockchain Startup Tierion to Seek $25 Million in Ethereum Token Sale,"""Listen to Flava Flav. The blockchain hype is out of control!""  As excitement for so-called private blockchains hit fever pitch in 2016, Wayne Vaughan became an unlikely spokesman for a small but vocal movement that sought to label it disingenuous and out of step with the technology's realities.  The CEO of what was then just a two-person startup wasn't afraid to punch above his weight, launching a parody website that poked fun at the popular claims of major banks, and that went so far as to use fake celebrity quotes and a 1980s-inspired car commercial to underscore the point.  But if he was initially skeptical about both ethereum and the wave of initial coin offerings (ICOs) it's enabled, Vaughan is again emerging as out of step with his peers, this time in his willingness to embrace an idea many still feel is controversial.  It's amidst this backdrop that Tierion is today announcing the Tierion Network Token (TNT), a publicly tradable digital asset that will be built on the ethereum blockchain.  As described in a new white paper, Tierion's token will seek to extend and amplify the network effect that supports its Chainpoint protocol, a technology the startup developed in 2015 that enables users to create time-stamped proofs using public blockchains.  This time around Vaughan is quick to assure that, despite his past proclivity for pranks, the token sale is no joke, positioning it as a way for Tierion to take its product to the ""next level.""  Vaughan told CoinDesk:  ""The reality is that startups are all always locked in an arms race for talent and capital, and there's a lot of people who are walking out the door, hanging out a white paper and no product and they're raising $15m to $20m. We're a company that's been around for 18 months and we have enterprise partnerships.""  To be held at the end of July, Tierion's token sale will seek to raise $25m, adding to the more than $600m in value that blockchain projects have this year secured from a public market of cryptocurrency buyers.  Further, he framed the decision as a way to satisfy traditional investors, who he argues are increasingly keen to encourage startups to pursue public crowdfunding powered by cryptography.  ""Every entrepreneur who is talking to people who are invested in this space, they now have to go to that meeting to say why they do not have a token as part of [their] business model, and that's just a fact,"" he said.  Token advisory service Element Group and law firm Cooley LLP are supporting the project.  How it works  Social factors aside, Vaughan is confident that creating a distributed blockchain network is the right choice for Tierion, one that will help the data verification services it has long provided become both more secure and more widely used.  In a manner that fits with the spirit of the technology, Vaughan asserts the move will help Chainpoint run at a massive scale by reducing its central stewardship.  ""The end users don't have to use the application,"" Vaughan explained. ""People will be able to run a Chainpoint node, and they will be able to offer a copy of all the services you currently get through Chainpoint.""  As part of the architecture design, Tierion and a network of core partners will be responsible for running the full stack of services for Chainpoint (or ""service clusters""), maintaining a new blockchain called a ""calendar"" to be mutually managed as a means of reducing the network's reliance on confirmations on the public ethereum and bitcoin blockchains for data accuracy.  Under the design, Tierion partners would host its own version of this service stack as a way to verify proofs and build its own applications, while a distributed network of nodes help scale and audit the network.  ""Chainpoint is a little different in that every node that gets added to our network increases our ability to verify proofs, and the more we have the better,"" Vaughan said. ""They don't have to worry about us going out of business or getting acquired.""  Microsoft will be the first organization to join Chainpoint Core and manage a service cluster.  Economics at play  As for the Tierion Network Token, a crucial difference according to Vaughan is that only those contributing to these back-end network operations will be required to interact and transact in the system resource.  As described in the white paper, the token is designed to incentivize the actions of core members by offsetting the costs incurred in operating the server clusters and anchoring this data into either bitcoin or ethereum.  ""Periodically, Core’s consensus algorithm elects a leader that can create an anchor block, which requires them to spend BTC or ETH to publish a transaction. The Core Member that creates the anchor block receives a block reward, as well as the tokens paid to Core for that anchor block,"" the paper reads.  Nodes, the open network of users supporting the system, earn tokens by verifying the blockchain created by core partners, charging for generating and verifying proofs.  It's this way, Vaughan explained the process by comparing the two roles to those of the stakeholders on the bitcoin blockchain.  ""The people who are part of the core are like miners, and they create the blockchain and they take all the anchoring. And the people who run nodes are like people in bitcoin who run full nodes, they can independently do whatever they want with the data, but they don't have the capability to write blocks,"" he explained.  Over time, Vaughan said the network will eventually require nodes to spend tokens to anchor data. Part of the ICO fundraising, he said, will be used to defer costs for the first year.  Capping the raise  As for the token sale itself, perhaps the most notable feature is the company's decision to set an upward limit on the amount raised.  As the market for ICOs has evolved, some critics have alleged sales that don't set limitations or valuations as encouraging speculation. Others, such as ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, have come out in support, arguing that, while outsized today, free market economics will ultimately provide a solution as participants develop expertise and methodology.  For his part, Vaughan portrayed the involvement of his VC-backed firm as evidence that the market is taking steps toward this maturation. For instance, while it is limiting its total fundraising, Tierion has big ambitions for the network.  ""The Tierion Network will fundamentally improve how the world secures and shares data. By providing a 'Proof Engine' for the Internet, everyone will be able to prove with absolute certainty, when data was created or if it has been modified from its original state,"" the white paper states.  Vaughan further sought to stress the pedigree of those involved in designing the sale as another reason for more skeptical startups to step off the sidelines.

42400135,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAc24DX,1499677217,Equity Markets on a Blockchain: Delaware's Potential Impact,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and the author of CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to CoinDesk subscribers.      Last week, Delaware passed amendments to state legislation that, once signed into law by the end of July, will give corporations registered in the state the right to issue and trade shares on a blockchain platform.  While this may on the surface sound like a small modification, it is a big deal. Companies and exchanges around the world have been investigating how distributed ledgers could help with issuance, execution and settlement (some have even issued shares on a blockchain). However, they have been doing so under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty, unsure of whether the stakeholders – including the relevant governing bodies – would allow the innovations to take hold.  For the first time, businesses will be able to experiment with new processes knowing they have the protection of the law.  This is likely to pave the way for the entire life cycle of a share – the issuance, custodianship, trading, shareholder communication and redemption – to be enacted on a blockchain. The result could be a reframing of the global securities network, one of the cornerstones of our modern capitalist economy.  The equity infrastructure used in most markets today evolved around paper-based issuance, and essentially has the same conceptual backbone as in the 17th century. Processes are complex, involving several steps, each with fees. Centralized clearing creates systemic risk by presenting a single point of failure, and since in most jurisdictions legal ownership rests with the transfer agents, true ownership can be obfuscated – in turn, this can violate rules that limit shareholdings.  Furthermore, a paper-based system – even a digitized one – is vulnerable to fraud, and centralized databases can suffer security breaches.  Settle for less  With a blockchain system, investors and issuers can interact directly with each other, in theory cutting out brokers, custodians and clearing houses, thus reducing transaction costs. Settlement can happen within hours instead of days, releasing funds and lowering carrying fees.  Legal ownership would be restored to investors and companies, and would be more transparent. Dividends and stock splits could be automated, reducing cost and error.  Also, a distributed ledger platform would remove the single point of failure risk, help make proxy voting more transparent and accurate and make it easier to manage cap tables as well as collateralisation.  There are disadvantages. Transparency, for one: not all investors want their positions to be visible. Error resolution is another: mistakes happen, and on an immutable ledger, how do you fix them?  What’s more, counterparty risk doesn’t go away, it just shifts. But as work on services and solutions picks up in the light of regulatory approval, so will the development of solutions.  Share the benefits  That this milestone was reached in Delaware is significant.  The state is 49th in the nation in terms of size and 45th in population, but it boasts two-thirds of US listed companies and 85% of IPOs. It has more registered legal entities than it has residents. This is due to its relatively flexible business legislation and tax framework, and to its reputation for being a standards bearer in corporate law.  What’s more, the recent amendment is part of a larger initiative to streamline corporate and governmental processes. The Delaware Blockchain Initiative, launched over a year ago, commits the state’s government to incorporating blockchain technology in the handling of official documents such as land titles, birth and death certificates, professional licenses, collateral claims and company filings.  So, here we have the US state with the largest concentration of registered corporations, and a reputation for supporting innovation, offering businesses the chance to test a new form of financing and governance.  While adoption will probably be slow, at least at first, the pace is likely to pick up as the benefits become even more apparent. Other jurisdictions could follow suit to avoid losing a chunk of their domiciled businesses. And the structure of financial markets could start to gradually, but fundamentally, change.  While the Delaware amendment won’t create a market revolution overnight, it does raise a question which highlights the systemic importance of the move: Will traditional equity markets still exist 10 years from now?
