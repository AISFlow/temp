42378249,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7UnAB,1438199621,US Presidential Candidate Rick Perry Reveals Bitcoin Stance,"US presidential candidate Rick Perry has stated he supports ""regulatory breathing room"" for digital currencies such as bitcoin.  The comments came during a new interview with The New York Observer that found Perry elaborating on issues that could form the core of his fiscal policy.  In the interview, Perry roundly denounced perceived issues in the financial system, stating:  “Wall Street should not be left off the hook for their bad behavior … instead of them being punished, it was the average American who paid the tremendous price. The fact of the matter is, to be quite frank: we got screwed.""  With the remarks, Perry joins fellow Republican presidential hopeful Rand Paul in his support for the technology. Paul announced in April that he would accept bitcoin for campaign donations.  Perry announced his candidacy in June following a failed bid for the Republican nomination in 2012. The 65-year-old Republican candidate previously served three terms as governor of Texas, a state that has long been less restrictive in its approach to digital currency regulation.  For example, in April 2014, the Texas Department of Banking was one of the first state-level regulatory bodies to issue guidelines to the industry. Former Texas congressman Steve Stockman was also one of the earliest advocates for the industry in Washington, first lobbying in 2014 to stop proposals such as New York's BitLicense.  Prior to the end of his term, Stockman submitted a bill that called for a moratorium on digital currency regulation that would have restricted such laws nationwide for five years.

42378245,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Un59,1438193969,Ripple Labs Taps US Treasury Official for Advisory Board,"Ripple Labs has added Michael Barr, a former US Treasury Department official, to its board of advisors.  Barr  previously served as Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions under President Barack Obama and as a special Treasury advisor to former President Bill Clinton. Barr also worked in the State Department and the US Supreme Court. He is currently teaching at the University of Michigan Law School.  Barr said in a statement:  “Our global payments system is badly outdated. I think innovation in payments can help make the financial system safer, reduce cost and improve access and efficiency for consumers and businesses alike.”  With the move, Barr becomes the latest former Obama administration official to join the startup's board of advisors.  Former director of the National Economic Council Gene Sperling was named to the board in January, and in March the company added former State Department official Anja Manuel.  Ripple Labs is the developer of a distributed payments network geared toward financial institutions.  The company is one of a growing number of startups pitching more permissioned blockchain alternatives to banks and financial services providers worldwide.

42378252,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7UnGT,1438193131,Survey: Consumers Say Bitcoin More Inconvenient Than Checks,"A new survey has found that consumers believe bitcoin to be more inconvenient than traditional payment methods such as credit cards and checks.  Conducted by prepaid and gift card product provider Blackhawk Network in April, the poll canvassed 1,000 US consumers, questioning them about their sentiment toward both traditional and emerging payment methods.  In total, 18% of respondents reported using alternative payment methods such as Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and bitcoin within the last year. Sixty-eight percent of these consumers indicated they used the products more than they did in 2014.  However, Blackhawk found that the consumer attitude toward bitcoin is still largely negative, revealing that 38% ranked bitcoin as the most inconvenient of surveyed payment methods including cash, credit cards, PayPal and checks.  Checks were ranked as the second most inconvenient payment method by consumers, with 35% reporting they viewed the payment method with dissatisfaction.  Cash, by comparison, was viewed as the most popular payment method, with 93% of consumers reporting a satisfaction with paper currency.  Evolving consumer sentiment  The survey joins an increasing body of research that suggests more consumers are now willing to at least try bitcoin and other digital currencies for use in commerce.  For example, a recent Goldman Sachs report found that 22% of US millennials have used bitcoin and intend to use the payment method again. Still, research also suggested many consumers remain unconvinced in the technology's utility for payments.  More than half of its 752 respondents suggested they have never used bitcoin and that they had no plans to do so in the future.

42378243,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Un3t,1438188918,US Government Funds $3 Million Cryptocurrency Research Initiative,"Three American universities are set to conduct wide-ranging research on cryptocurrencies using roughly $3m in grant funding from the National Science Foundation, a US government agency that supports and funds scientific research.  Cornell  , the University of Maryland and the University of California Berkeley will focus on developing new cryptocurrency systems that, according to principal investigator Elaine Shi, will address “pain points” attributed to bitcoin and other existing networks.  The Initiative for Cryptocurrency and Contracts (IC3) will also involve Cornell researcher Emin Gun Sirer; Dawn Song from UC Berkeley; and Jonathan Katz, David van Horn and Michael Hicks from the University of Maryland. The funding itself will be used to support the researchers involved with the project.  According to Shi, the growing ecosystem of startups focusing on digital currency research and rising interest among a broad range of parties necessitates “a rigorous science for cryptocurrencies”.  She told CoinDesk:  “We believe that our research can help establish cryptocurrency as a prominent research area, and make a big impact in shaping the future of financial transactions and e-commerce.”  According to National Science Foundation acting deputy division director Nina Amla, funding for the initiative comes from the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace program, an initiative devoted to funding research into cyber security and digital privacy. That program saw $75m in grants awarded last year, a figure that the agency hopes to meet or exceed this year.  Focus on smart contracts  The initiative will devote resources to developing new systems that enable expanded transaction scalability, privacy and user functionality. Smart contracts will be a major focus of the initiative, building on prior work by University of Maryland researchers.  One such project is Hawk, a blockchain system that enables private smart contracts to be written but not disclosed to the public. Developed jointly by Cornell and the University of Maryland, Hawk was unveiled in early June and will see further refinement and development as the IC3 project commences, according to Shi.  The work builds off previous efforts conducted at the University of Maryland last fall, during which time faculty and students formed a smart contracts laboratory to explore potential issues and opportunities. A research paper on that initiative can be found here.  One of the major findings, according to Shi, was that “it is extremely easy to make mistakes programming smart contracts”. This, she explained, raises the risk that funds can be irretrievably lost or diverted by “a selfish counterparty” as a result of such an error.  “This is where we can greatly benefit from formal program analysis techniques,” she said.  Latest investment in cryptocurrency research  The IC3 initiative isn’t the first time the NSF has invested in a program devoted to conducting research into cryptocurrency.  The agency, which received more than $7b in funding from Congress for Fiscal Year 2015, has funded other efforts aimed at exploring cryptocurrencies, including one initiative at Princeton University and another at the University of California-Irvine.  The NSF’s Amla echoed Shi by saying the proposal offers a way to address a number of cross-disciplinary subjects, related to not only cryptocurrency in particular but also cybersecurity, digital privacy and financial innovation more broadly.  “There’s a lot of really good technical issues here that they have identified and have proposed to study,” she said.  Beyond cryptocurrency  Shi hopes the initiative will lead to “closer collaborations” between companies in the industry and academic researchers working on cryptocurrency issues or related projects.  She explained:  “We have been faced with many challenges in trying to bring formal rigor to cryptocurrency design. Personally, I am particularly excited about cross-disciplinary research challenges, and I believe that cryptocurrency can serve as a central playground for synergizing disparate research communities.”  Ultimately, the goal is to seek potentially new ways of developing and implementing cryptocurrency technology.  “I believe that our research will help solve some of the fundamental challenges and most difficult problems in cryptocurrency design, and make a big impact,” Shi concluded.

42378244,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Un6P,1438167374,Russian Watchdog Threatens News Site Over Bitcoin Article,"Russia's media watchdog has told Zuckerberg Pozvonit, a tech news site,that it must delete or edit a bitcoin-related article it published two years ago.  According to Global Voices, Roskomnadzor – the Kremlin's executive body responsible for controlling and supervising media and mass communications – issued a notice today stating that, if the news source did not act within three days, access to the website would be blocked.  The explanatory article, titled “What Are Bitcoins and Who Needs Them?” was first published in April 2013 and offered a brief introduction to the digital currency and its history.  Vyacheslav Tsyplukhin, who publishes Zuckerberg Pozvonit spoke about the Roskomnadzor's notice on his Facebook profile, noting that the outlet usually refrained from publishing material of a political nature.  His status suggested the article would remain unaltered:  ""We haven't discussed the issue collectively yet, but I maintain the position that we don't have to delete anything. Let them close the website, and then let them explain to our 1.8 million readers, and to the industry, what is going on.""  Bitcoin crackdown  This is not the first time Roskomnadzor has taken a stance against bitcoin-related online content.  In January this year, the media watchdog blocked access to various bitcoin websites in the country, including bitcoin.org, a community site sponsored by the Bitcoin Foundation; bitcoin.it, a wiki project about bitcoin; Indacoin exchange; and BTC.sec, a bitcoin news site.  A few months later, BTCsec.com and Smile Expo – a Moscow based event company which hosted its second bitcoin conference in December last year – testified in Sverdlovsk Regional Court as part of a complaint against the government's decision to block access to their domains. The websites won their case and access was subsequently reinstated.  The news also follows Russia President Vladimir Putin's first ever public comments on digital currencies during a live TV broadcast. Speaking to Russia 24 during an educational broadcast, Putin voiced his support for the Russian Central Bank in its exploration of technology.  He said:  ""We do not reject anything, but there are serious, really fundamental issues related to its wider usage, at least, today.""  Russian Kremlin image via Shutterstock.
