Nifty Gateway will buy offsets equivalent to double its CO2 footprint at the end of every month, said founders Duncan and Griffin Cock Foster. Site developers also plan on running Nifty’s NFT minting system through EIP-2309 to cut Ethereum gas fees by 99%.      The concession comes as environmentalists attack NFT creators for crypto’s carbon emissions, reserving particular shade for marketplaces like Nifty Gateway that drive thousands of transactions. Already, a torrent of online criticism prompted one art website to abandon its NFT plans.      Nifty Gateway said the offset program will use an open-source emissions project as its benchmark. That codebase (whose contributor did not immediately reply to CoinDesk) estimated Nifty Gateway was responsible for 13 million kg of CO2 through March 22 – the second-largest footprint among marketplaces – despite it being only the fourth-largest marketplace by transaction count.      “In theory Nifty Gateway will become a net remover of carbon,” the Cock Fosters wrote in their blog post.      Even as they touted the offsets, the twins bemoaned the “double standard” they claimed is applied to the booming crypto art scene – which relies in large part on traceable transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Meanwhile, the “offline art world” goes unchecked, they said.      “Because there is no blockchain to account for the carbon footprint of the traditional art world,” they wrote, “such criticism has not been leveled against” it, pointing to museum-goers who drive cars as one example.      Indeed, CoinDesk could not find public estimates on the global carbon impact of patrons of the arts by press time. This reporter estimated that driving to the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s gift shop for the purpose of buying a Claude Monet print (a 6.7-mile drive, his nearest available marketplace) would emit 4 kg of CO2. Meanwhile, acquiring a GIF of a 1,239-run gummy bear mugshot on Nifty Gateway would produce nearly 31 kg of CO2, according to Digiconomist.      A representative for Gemini did not immediately tell CoinDesk when Nifty Gateway would begin purchasing offsets.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/29/nifty-gateway-pledges-to-go-carbon-negative-amid-criticism-of-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d95bb9a714567c8fa99c4610e9109cd7ffd1903-1400x1050.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386290,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSNSP,1617049341,"Market Wrap: Bitcoin, Ether Gain After Visa Deal as Stocks Struggle With Archegos Margin Call","Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $57,626.86 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 4.38% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $54,826.06-$58,353.53 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin proved resilient to the latest instability in traditional markets, as the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose above $58,000 briefly Monday, well above last week’s low around $50,000.      The divergence offers a reminder of how bitcoin, which traded lightly in sync with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks for most of last year, is now more or less back to doing its own thing: The 90-day correlation between the two has dropped to zero.      Some U.S. stocks went through an unprecedented sell-off on Friday after the forced liquidation of more than $20 billion in holdings linked to Bill Hwang’s family office, Archegos Capital Management. On Monday, stocks were mixed as traders weighed the potential fallout on Wall Street.      “We are still getting reports of continual liquidation by prime brokers on the Street,” Annabelle Huang, partner at Hong Kong-based market maker Amber Group, said. “But from a crypto-centric perspective, we observed 208.8K BTC ($11.05 billion worth) was withdrawn from Coinbase in the past four months, which is a bullish sign for bitcoin and the crypto market.”      The stock market in general has struggled in the recent weeks. The Nasdaq Composite is down 7% from a intraday record on Feb. 16.      Bitcoin, still considered an alternative asset and a risky one by many investors, traveled lower with the stock market, down by 18.0% to $50,458.10 on Thursday from its all-time high at $61,556.59 on March 13.      Yet, the quick recovery to near $58,000 demonstrates stronger confidence from investors in the oldest and largest cryptocurrency. The next level of price resistance is seen at around $60,000.      “Exchange outflows have increased this week, indicating market participants are moving crypto assets into cold storage or private custody,” the digital-asset data firm TradeBlock wrote in its weekly newsletter on Monday. “Private-wallet custody typically indicates a pattern of longer-term holding.” TradeBlock is owned by CoinDesk.      Moreover, bitcoin received another price boost from Visa after the payment giant announced its support for USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar.      There’s no direct link in the deal to bitcoin, but the announcement was seen by traders as a fresh sign of growing institutional and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Climbing 8.33% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $1665.63-$1839.80 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    “Ether is rising from short-term oversold territory along with bitcoin following a swift about 18% pullback below minor resistance from February,” Katie Stockton, a market technician at Fairlead Strategies, wrote in her weekly newsletter on Monday. “After a few weeks of additional consolidation, we expect a buying opportunity to unfold once overbought conditions are worked off.”      CoinDesk reported Monday that a sharp drop in an obscure data point from cryptocurrency options markets – the spread between the one-month implied volatility (IV) for ether and bitcoin – suggests traders may be shifting their primary focus back to bitcoin after several weeks of focusing on ether and other altcoins.      And while the link between Visa's deal and bitcoin is tangential and abstract, there's a direct and concrete connection to ether. Visa processed the landmark cryptocurrency payment transaction directly on the Ethereum blockchain; Crypto.com sent a USDC stablecoin transaction over the network to an account at Anchorage custody under Visa's name.

42386283,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSNIL,1617047209,‘Continuous Vampire Attack’: The AMM Wars Are Getting Interesting With Integral,"Uniswap’s latest plans may be public, but that isn’t stopping rivals from building alternatives.      Integral, a new automated market maker (AMM) designed with a baked-in order book, went live early Monday. The protocol’s asset pools have attracted $239 million as of press time as savvy decentralized finance (DeFi) traders race for early token rewards.      The project – built by four Harvard friends and a cast of industry bigwigs – is hoping to syphon liquidity away from decentralized exchanges like Uniswap with its approach to impermanent loss and order book mirroring. Integral’s team members think their design can not only quote better prices but provide fairer returns for liquidity providers (LPs).      “Our primary research question was: ‘What would be the final form of AMMs?’ And the answer: ‘One that eats other exchanges’ liquidity,’” Integral wrote in documents shared with CoinDesk, adding:    “Whenever another exchange tries to beat us with better liquidity, we mirror this liquidity onto ourselves until we regain the world’s best liquidity again. This process can be thought of as a continuous vampire attack until all world liquidity is integrated by us.”    Vampire attacks were made famous by SushiSwap, a clone of Uniswap created by the pseudonymous developer Chef Nomi. During that time, the platform offered token rewards for liquidity moved from Uniswap to SushiSwap. It now seems Integral is taking the idea one step farther by “mirroring” liquidity onto itself to gain adoption.      The founding team of nine, which has requested to remain nameless, is being advised by Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee, Gauntlet founder Tarun Chitra, Compound Finance founder Robert Leshner and Framework Ventures co-founders Michael Anderson and Vance Spencer.    Integral’s scheme    Integral relies on two features to market itself as a competitor to Uniswap, whose latest version typically does $1.25 billion in 24-hour trading volume.      First, Integral uses Uniswap’s own price oracles, but with a five-minute delay. The team thinks the time delay will decrease instances of impermanent loss, where assets contributed to a DEX’s pool bleed out value. That bleeding is the result of how AMMs quote prices – by balancing asset reserves against one another and having arbitrage traders add or remove assets based on price movements off the exchange.      This rebalancing, in certain situations, can lead to LPs losing value instead of gaining it. It’s thought a time delay will force traders to other platforms while still offering competitive prices.    Read more: Uniswap Unveils Version 3 in Bid to Stay DeFi’s Top Dog    Second, Integral will mirror snapshots of Binance’s order book onto the AMM to artificially create depth accompanied by Uniswap’s (delayed) prices. By doing so, Integral can experiment with different price curves relative to other AMMs.      Integral expects to be a home for whales, at least for the time being, given the need for liquidity to on-board to the exchange.

42386274,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSNC3,1617046879,"Don't Follow the Suits, Follow the Weirdos","Cryptocurrency was invented by a guy who liked message boards.      Then a young developer who thought decentralization could go even further kicked off a world computer with a white paper and some emails.      The big wins in crypto are going to come from the punks, the hippies, the malcontents and the contrarians. What I'm saying is: In this very bullish season, don't be enraptured by the suits.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    We see the allure of the suits here at CoinDesk in a very direct way. For a few years, we saw an onslaught of corporate blockchain accelerators and pilot projects that were never about ... well, anything. It was obvious “innovation theater,” but toward what end? Who knows?      I appreciate the allure. The whole argument to be ""grown-up"" seems very convincing. Yes, the future of blockchains is probably enterprise something something ... it sounded truthy.      Now the suits are back and it looks like this time they are here for real. Instead of “blockchain not bitcoin” it seems like we have hit an inflection point where a lot of the rich guys hold a little BTC and maybe some ETH.      So is it all ""game over"" once Goldman or Morgan Stanley opens up a crypto division?      Game, set and match. Satoshi has won! Sooo ... Wall Street can take it from here, right?      Just today, Visa announced a demo project using an Ethereum stablecoin. So this is all … settled?      That's not where I'd place my bets.      I would suggest continuing to look at what the tinkerers are up to.      The method works; it's where I have invested my reporting attention and it keeps paying off. Like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) now? I first wrote about them in 2018. I told you about OpenSea three years before the venture capitalists at a16z dropped $23 million into the NFT marketplace. Were you happy about the UNI airdrop? This guy gave you a heads up about Uniswap a year before it started to shake up the space. The DeFi summer of 2020 was wild, right? Well, I first told you about the decentralized finance market Compound in 2018 and I was digging into MakerDAO regularly through 2019.      It's not hard to find real stuff out on the edge. That's where all of it is.      The suits show up when sectors become safe, after they plateau. They show up when something can be turned into a nice, predictable little business. They show up once it's boring. If they manage to show up early, they show up to make it boring.    DAOs    The opposite of the suits is DAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations.      The first big one didn't work out great. Shortly after that debacle, MakerDAO decided to get a lot more formal, though the protocol itself continued to be governed by token holders.      For a while, it might have looked like the suits, with their proofs-of-concept and press releases and sticky note-covered innovation labs were winning. But that had clearly changed by last summer when we saw DeFi take off and people started to once again get excited about organizations that exist entirely on blockchains, with no formal instantiation in the legally governed world.      The most prominent DAO in this space doesn't even really use that branding. It is Yearn Finance. I often wonder how many people who put their assets into Yearn think about the fact that there are a bunch of actual people behind this thing. What might be called the ""staff"" of Yearn put a ton of time into it, they make a lot of money from it and – at least insofar as I have ever been able to determine – none of that occurs under the auspices of any sort of formal organization as you or I might normally expect. No company. Just a baby giant, growing.      We got a rare glance under the hood about how it works when Tracheopteryx, who functions in a sort of chief operations officer-ish role within Yearn, spoke at ETH Denver:      But basically, we have a bunch of smart contracts written by an enigmatic DeFi artiste that attracted a bunch of other savvy degens to get involved and start suggesting ways to juice the already considerable profits on assets dropped into Yearn.      This is not normal. This is weird. Yet, Yearn and other DAOs like it will grow and shake things up further.    Facebook/Libra    On the other end of the spectrum, we have Facebook's foray into crypto: born as libra, downgraded to diem.      The social network thought that it could convince global regulators to allow it to upend the way money works by asking nicely and showing up at a lot of legislative hearings.      It turned out that asking permission to disrupt global industries doesn't work that well.      Zuckerberg and Co. never really appeared to have actual conviction about decentralization. The company needed to diversify its revenue streams if Facebook was going to let users communicate privately, as the company had been promising in 2019.      But playing nice with the global money cops didn't work out, so it moved on.      Actual change comes from folks too irascible to quit doing something because someone tells them it's a bad idea or it doesn't fit their conception of how we've always done things.      So if big banks and financial companies and payment firms want to hop in, cool, let them. But that's not when the excitement starts. That's when the excitement ends.      If you want excitement, keep your eyes on the folks with unicorns on their shirts, buzzes in their hair and/or chains hanging off ... wherever — weirdos for the win.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | YFI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/29/dont-follow-the-suits-follow-the-weirdos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9e516d83ec88bde43a09b3c4cccc2913288e90e6-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386276,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSNDJ,1617035217,Ether-Bitcoin Implied Volatility Spread Points to a Macro-Driven Market,"Cryptocurrency traders might be shifting their primary focus back to bitcoin after several weeks focused on ether, alternative digital assets and even non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      That might be one takeaway from an obscure data point pulled from the market for cryptocurrency options: the spread between the one-month implied volatility (IV) for ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC). It’s a measure of expected relative price turbulence between the two, and it has dropped to 8%, the lowest since Dec. 8, according to the data provider Skew.      Historically, the implied volatility spread has proven a reliable indicator of upcoming shifts in market leadership. In September the ether-bitcoin implied volatility spread fell to multi-month lows, signaling a change in traders’ focus to bitcoin from ether and decentralized finance (DeFi); some even called it the end of the “Summer of DeFi.” Then, during the final three months of 2020, bitcoin surged 168%, outperforming ether and other major cryptocurrencies.      Implied volatility is investors' expectation of how risky or volatile an asset would be over a specific period, and is driven by net buying pressure for options and historical price volatility. In this case, the focus is on the difference, or spread, between the implied volatilities of the two crypto assets.      At the most basic level, the drop in the spread to three-month lows indicates that options traders foresee ether and other coins trading in line with bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.      So cryptocurrency markets in the coming months might trade more in line with bitcoin’s fundamental drivers, which last year became more closely tied with economic data, because a growing number of large investors and institutions started buying the largest cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation. Analysts say bitcoin has matured as a macro asset, with several public-listed companies such as Tesla adding it to their balance sheets.      Factors such as monetary and fiscal policy expectations, news flow related to institutional adoption and traditional market action could have a bigger sway in determining prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, at least over the next four weeks.      Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, and many other so-called altcoins are built atop Ethereum's blockchain technology. As such, many alternative cryptocurrencies tend to trade in line with ether.      The volatility spread climbed to record highs in January, suggesting scope for bigger percentage moves in ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies.      The volatility gauge peaked at a record high of 58% on Jan. 20 and has been falling ever since. Three- and six-month spreads are also on a declining trend.      While bitcoin has gained 100% this quarter, names like ether, XRP and chainlink (LINK) have chalked out more significant gains.      One giant caveat: While the compression of the ether-bitcoin implied volatility spread suggests low expectations for ether price turbulence relative to bitcoin, it doesn't necessarily say anything about the direction of impending moves.      So bitcoin could go higher or lower, with ether and other coins likely to follow suit, and possibly charting smaller percentage moves than the crypto market leader.

Bitcoin is already on the offensive heading into the seasonally bullish period. The cryptocurrency jumped to $58,000 on Monday, breaking out of a two-week-long bearish trend, after payments giant Visa added support for the stablecoin USDC.

42386285,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSNNN,1617034323,Nasdaq-Listed Canadian Firm Mogo Launches Bitcoin Cashback Mortgage Program,"Mogo Finance Technology Inc., a Canadian fintech firm listed on Nasdaq (NASDAQ:MOGO) and Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX:MOGO), is now giving its members who take out a new mortgage or refinance an existing one the chance to earn cash to buy bitcoin using its bitcoin rewards account.      In an announcement on Monday, Vancouver-based Mogo said the cashback rewards program now includes “MogoMortgage” and will give users up to C$3,100 (US$2,461) in cashback rewards. The rewards are distributed in dollars into clients’ accounts which, in turn, allows clients to buy bitcoin through the MogoCrypto program within the Mogo app.      Canada’s residential mortgage market is estimated at C$1.7 trillion (US$1.35 trillion). According to the company, this new scheme allows Canadians to get a mortgage while earning a cash reward to purchase bitcoin.      “Given the volatility and speculative nature of bitcoin, there’s an increasing number of Canadians who are looking for ways to participate without risking their own money, and our bitcoin rewards program meets this demand,” said David Feller, CEO of Mogo.      MogoMortgage is currently available to Mogo Members in a number of selected provinces including Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador.      The rewards program already applies to the Mogo Visa Platinum prepaid cardholders, allowing users to earn 1% cashback on purchases in Canada and 2% for foreign transactions, which can then be exchanged for bitcoin within the app.      In February, Mogo announced it would acquire a 19.99% stake in the Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Coinsquare with the rights to increase ownership up to 40%.      Mogo was founded in 2003 and had an initial public offering on the TSX in June 2015 and has a market cap capitalization of over CA$500 million.

42386288,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSNPt,1617033302,FTX CEO Says Miami Heat Naming Rights Deal Is Partly Philanthropic,"Why did cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX agree to pay $135 million for the naming rights to a Miami stadium? For the good of humanity, says CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. (Well, in part.)      In an appearance Monday on CoinDesk TV’s ""First Mover,"" Bankman-Fried said he wants to make as much money as possible in crypto and give it away through the practice of effective altruism.      This was one motivation for FTX’s deal with the Miami-Dade, Fla., venue, home to National Basketball Association team Miami Heat, he said. To his mind, it's partly an investment in the community.      “I’m looking at what role I can be playing in the world,” Bankman-Fried said. “Frankly, I hope we did a lot of good with some of the money that’s going to be spent there on this, and help a lot of residents in the county.”      Disruptive technologies have birthed a long line of billionaires that go on to print their names on the side of arenas and team jerseys. Amid a booming period in the cryptocurrency industry, Bankman-Fried said he’s looking at what his legacy will be.      Internet legends Chamath Palihapitiya is a minority stakeholder of the Golden State Warriors and Mark Cuban bought the Dallas Mavericks in January 2000. If the NBA approves FTX’s deal, Bankman-Fried would become the first crypto chief executive whose name could be synonymous with a sports franchise.      To be clear: This is still a business transaction. Bankman-Fried acknowledged there’s no “well-understood conversion break” to determine how much to pay for the naming rights and whether it's a good deal. In some sense, the $135 million spent could be considered an advertising expense.      “We feel like we’ve built a really great product … and we’d really love to see a lot of people get exposed to it and try it out and see what they think,” Bankman-Fried said. Miami is a growing hub for crypto businesses, and the headline-grabbing deal could lure in a new set of users who have never played around with crypto, he said.      “You see reverberations from what happens in the states,"" Bankman-Fried said.      The line between making money and doing good is frequently blurred in crypto. Non-fungible tokens, for instance, touted for the ability to democratize ownership of digital goods, are becoming an arena for scams, Bankman-Fried said.      “I worry that a lot of what's going on in NFTs is not … someone taking a product with intense demand and finding a way to use blockchain to make it that much better,” he said. “The worry here is this ends up like 2017, 2018 with [initial coin offerings] and ends up giving a bad name to some of the space.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/29/ftx-ceo-says-miami-heat-naming-rights-deal-is-partly-philanthropic,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29d46c6a17b008104c22072c083304d9a131d55b-2012x1204.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386284,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSNM7,1617032724,India's Millennials Embrace Digital Gold Despite Proposed Bitcoin Ban,"Bitcoin might become for India’s millennials what gold is for their parents, no matter what the government says.      India, the fifth-largest nation by nominal GDP, often makes headlines for its attempts to outlaw crypto, real or rumored. But the government’s less-than-friendly attitude toward crypto has not curbed Indians’ curiosity about it.      Nor do rumors scare away the giants of the crypto world. Just last week, Coinbase announced it is planning to establish its presence in India. Another powerhouse, Binance, has been there since 2019 when it acquired India’s largest crypto exchange, WazirX.      India has a population of 1.4 billion people (the largest in the world after China) that is predominantly young (median age is between 28 and 29 years old) and tech savvy. Over the past few decades, India has become a developer hub for many tech projects around the world.      “India is one of the youngest countries in the world, and these 28- to 29-year-olds are people who want to be a part of the revolution,” said Indian crypto advocate and YouTube influencer Kashif Raza.      India also has the second-largest online population after China, with over half a billion users taking advantage of the cheapest internet in the world. According to the BBC, one gigabyte of mobile data costs $0.26 in India, compared with $12.37 in the U.S. and a global average of $8.53.      This means India has the potential to become “one of the largest crypto economies in the world,” said Mohammed Roshan, former chief scientist at the Unocoin exchange and now the CEO of GoSats, an app allowing people earn bitcoin rewards while shopping online.      Yet, mixed signals sent by the authorities might be keeping some Indians from embracing bitcoin, experts told CoinDesk. India is 11th on Chainalysis’ 2020 report listing global crypto adoption by nation.      Indians’ excitement about crypto is visible, however. According to a report by Quartz, in 2018, one in every 10 bitcoin purchases in the world happened in India. The country is the second-largest source of web traffic to Paxful, a peer-to-peer bitcoin trading platform, after the U.S., according to SimilarWeb.      Last year gave a solid boost to Indians’ interest in crypto overall, Roshan said: “People who didn’t even really know about crypto are now talking about NFTs.”    Stocking up on digital gold    WazirX is the largest exchange in India, acquired by Binance in 2019, and it covers about half of the Indian crypto market. According to CEO Nischal Shetty, WazirX currently has 1.8 million users. Using that figure and the number of crypto app downloads in app stores and web traffic data, Shetty estimated there might be as many as 10 million users in India.      Most WazirX users just buy and hold, Shetty said. While 10% to 15% of the exchange's customers are “heavy traders who trade every day,” not many use crypto as a vehicle for remittances. By Shetty’s estimate, in India about 1.5 million people are trading crypto while around 6 million are just holding it.      WazirX’s daily trading volume is about $55 million, according to CoinGecko, but has been fluctuating between $16 million and $141 million through the first quarter of 2020. The entire Indian market sees daily volumes of $150 million to $350 million, Shetty believes, and the total value of crypto assets held by Indians is hovering around $1.5 billion. Up to 55% of that might be in bitcoin, Shetty said. For many Indians, bitcoin is digital gold, i.e., a means of saving money.      Indians have a habit of accumulating actual gold as a savings tool, and it has strong cultural roots, said Kashif Raza.      “Indian culture always promoted savings. India has always been a huge holder of gold. Every family is keeping gold in their house,” he said.      When a couple gets married or a child is born, the family is often gifted with gold. That family wealth, in a form of jewelry, can be passed down to new generations.      But India has a history of prohibitive policies against foreign currency purchases, so the habit of saving money in dollars to hedge against inflation that’s popular in South America or Western Europe, doesn’t appear to be as widespread in India.    Read more: Indian Government Officials Give Mixed Signals Over Planned Crypto Legislation    As Shruti Rajagopalan, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, wrote in an op-ed for Bloomberg, in the 1970s and 1980s, due to the regulation known as the License Raj, Indians could only hold foreign currency for a specific purpose after getting a permit from the central bank. The government would raid people’ houses to seize dollars and gold bars, she added.      Bitcoin is harder to control or confiscate, and it also provides a new way of earning money even when the mainstream economy is doing not so well, especially during the coronavirus pandemic year of 2020.      “Gold would be the investment of choice for the older generation. The young generation sees the advantage ... to buy bitcoin, because gold became more stable and bitcoin is so fast-moving,” Shetty said.      Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at the crypto wallet Luno (a CoinDesk sister company), agreed, saying younger Indians view bitcoin as a better investment than gold.      The pandemic may have made crypto more popular. Many people stuck at home for months, some of whom lost their jobs, turned to alternative ways of earning money. Registrations on crypto exchanges went up, Raza said. According to Shetty, WazirX’s user count grew threefold since March 2020, and the trading volume went up by a factor of at least eight.      It also helps bitcoin’s popularity that people in India are closely following U.S. tech companies like PayPal and Tesla, which are embracing bitcoin.      “There is a heavy tech influence from the U.S. in India,” Shetty added.    Not just hodling    Remittances might have been another big use case for crypto in India. India is the largest receiver of inward remittances globally, the World Bank found in 2018, with an inflow of $79 billion.      However, experts who spoke to CoinDesk said not many Indians are using crypto to send money across borders – at least, not yet. Roshan believes one of the reasons is because it’s usually younger Indians who are working abroad and sending money to their older relatives in India, and those relatives “might not know what to do with it.”      The regulatory uncertainty doesn’t help, said Alpen Sheth, senior technologist for financial innovation at Mercy Corps and member of the Digital Currency Governance Consortium at the World Economic Forum.      “If the government is going to come after it, why would I use it? The fact that the RBI [previously] basically prohibited banks from dealing with crypto put up a red flag for a lot of people,” he said.      However, the younger generation might be willing to use bitcoin in different ways, said Roshan.      “Millennials, people past 25 to 26 years old, think of bitcoin as a long term investment. Gen Z people are more about spending. They say: We want to spend sats, we want to get rid of bank cards,” he said.    Mixed messages and the looming ban    In 2013, the first crypto exchange in India, Unocoin, was launched. A day later, the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), warned Indians about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies. The regulator has been skeptical about crypto, even while encouraging India’s banks to experiment with blockchain.      In April 2018, the RBI barred India’s banks from serving crypto exchanges and related businesses. The country’s crypto industry immediately struck back, challenging the ban in court. In March 2020, India’s Supreme Court ruled against RBI and lifted the ban.      The Indian government started discussing possible crypto regulations back in 2017, but it only introduced a bill into the parliament this past January, which would ban cryptocurrencies except the one RBI might issue in the future. In addition, according to unconfirmed reports, the government might be considering banning and blocking IP addresses associated with crypto exchanges.      At the same time, a reassuring signal came from the minister of finance and corporate affairs, Nirmala Sitharaman, who said on March 15 the government is “not shutting all options.”      “We will allow certain windows for people to do experiments on the blockchain, bitcoins or cryptocurrency,” Sitharaman said.      In addition, the government has its eyes on companies that might be using crypto. On March 25, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs announced businesses will have to report crypto on their balance sheets starting April 1.      The regulator is also actively exploring the possibility of issuing a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, backed by the Indian rupee.      India’s crypto industry does not believe the government will ban crypto. A full ban might hurt not only crypto users but quite a few businesses. In a November 2020 RBI Bulletin, the central bank said there were 342 crypto products and services in India.      WazirX’s Shetty believes things are looking up.      “The bill is a step forward. At least, the government is talking about crypto and the regulation. As an industry we’re doing a number of things to make sure the government understands what this new technology is,” he said.      For crypto services, the regulation means access to banking (because so far only a handful of banks catering to crypto businesses) and clearing the industry of scams.      Talks about the possible crypto ban “caused some panic in the market for sure,” Luno’s Ayyar said, so the market might cool down in the coming months due to the uncertainty.    Read more: India’s Central Bank Sees Pros and Cons With National Digital Currency    However, “the finance minister seemed quite positive about ensuring that innovation does not get trampled and hence the industry is in general hopeful of a positive outcome overall,” he added.      Sheth said he believes things might go either way.      “The government may take a very harsh action against cryptocurrency. But there is not much consistency inside the government about that, seems like there are conflicting perspectives about it inside the government,” he said.      He added that because of that inconsistency, it’s very hard to predict what will happen next.      “Even people who talk to government officials don’t know much,” he said. But he expects the regulators most likely will adapt to the new reality and choose to ban only payments in crypto (which means, using it as money that competes with the national currency) and oblige people to report crypto gains for their taxes.      At the end of the day, most crypto exchanges in India have two entities, one in India and one abroad, so if things turn hostile at home they can easily move operations out, Raza and Roshan told CoinDesk. Popular jurisdictions include Singapore, the UAE and Estonia.      In the meantime, scary rumors of the future crypto ban only piques people’s curiosity, Sheth said. “The rumored ban is stimulating a lot of conversation among the population about cryptocurrency,” he said, adding:    “Anecdotally, everyone I know in India is curious about getting exposure to bitcoin.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/29/indias-millennials-embrace-digital-gold-despite-proposed-bitcoin-ban,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bab1de76fdd45536784042a69fe008a14812c7b-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an announcement made on Monday, the DFSA said it has published its framework for regulating the space and is giving the public 30 days to comment.  The regulatory body is proposing updating its regulations to facilitate activities based on distributed ledger technology (DLT). The update will focus on public access to buying and trading security tokens and on issues related to the provision of custody.  The key changes include allowing those facilities that trade security tokens to have direct access members, including retail clients, said DFSA.  The agency said it will issue proposals for other types of tokens such as “exchange tokens” and “utility tokens” later in 2021.  “The proposal for regulation of Security Tokens is a key milestone in paving a clear and certain path for those issuers who wish to raise capital in or from the DIFC using DLT and similar technology, and for those firms who intend to be involved in this market, by conducting or providing financial services,” said Bryan Stirewalt, the chief executive of the DFSA.  Stirewalt said the DFSA has drawn on the experience of other regulators who have taken cautious steps in the rapidly developing area.

42386286,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSNOd,1617019181,You’re a Lemon if You Buy a Tesla With Bitcoin,"Bitcoin fans were thrilled to see car manufacturer Tesla add bitcoin as a payments option last week.      But a quick scan of the fine print suggests that bitcoiners should probably lower their expectations. It could be dangerous for their financial health to pay for a Tesla with bitcoin rather than dollars, especially if a refund is required.    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    Bitcoiners have long dreamt of bitcoin payments going mainstream. The awkwardness of Tesla’s foray into bitcoin payments is symptomatic of how difficult it will be to achieve this goal.    Lemon laws    All U.S. states have passed laws that protect car buyers unlucky enough to be stuck with vehicles that have manufacturing defects. These ""lemon laws"" vary by state, but in general any new car owner who has been sold a lemon has the right to a complete refund, or ""buy back."" Tesla provides its customers with a long list of their lemon law rights here.      New car buyers have a certain time period to exercise their lemon law rights. Florida law, for instance, stipulates a car buyer has 24 months to make a lemon-law claim to the seller. The car seller is typically entitled to a few attempts to fix the car. But if it can't, then the state's lemon law is triggered and the owner can ask for all of his or her money back.      See also: Marc Hochstein - Elon Musk’s Bitcoin Marketing Coup      So when Tesla sells you a new $50,000 car, it isn't just selling you a hunk of metal, plastic, rubber and a battery. It is also selling you a long-term relationship with Elon Musk. That is, you are purchasing his promise – a multi-year IOU in his name – to repay $50,000 cash when the conditions of your state's lemon laws are triggered.      Unfortunately, the way that Tesla has specified this long-term relationship privileges people who pay with fiat over those who pay with bitcoin. To see why, look at the last page of Tesla's three-page ""Bitcoin Payment Terms & Conditions"" below.      In short, if your $50,000 Tesla is a dud and your state's lemon law entitles you to a refund or buyback, Tesla says it will pay you back in one of two ways. It will return the exact amount of bitcoins from the time of purchase. Or it will pay back the $50,000 in U.S. dollars. It reserves the right to choose which, bitcoin or dollars.      And that's the danger. If the price of bitcoin has plunged by 50%, there's a good chance Tesla will refund your lemon with $25,000 worth of bitcoins, not a $50,000 check. Congrats, you're $25,000 poorer.      Buy a Tesla with regular U.S. dollars and you’re guaranteed a full $50,000 refund.      What if bitcoin's price has doubled? If you qualify for a lemon law buyback, you're probably not going to get $100,000 in bitcoin back from Tesla. Tesla reserves the right to pay the refund in fiat, so it'll probably just send you a check for $50,000.      See also: Dan Kuhn - Want to Buy a Tesla With Bitcoin? It Ain’t Easy      Given reports of Tesla car unreliability, Tesla buyers may be particularly likely to require lemon law protection. Unfortunately, Tesla obliges its bitcoiner customers – but not its fiats – to give up a big chunk of their lemon law benefits.      That’s not a very fair policy for a company that wants to be seen as bitcoin-friendly. Bitcoin customers are being asked to bear all the risk of bitcoin price declines while all the benefits of price rises go to Tesla. It’s ""heads I win, tails you lose.""    The difficulty of bitcoin payments    Tesla's contortions around bitcoin purchases are emblematic of how tricky it is to refashion a speculative asset such as bitcoin for payments.      We usually think of a payment as a one-off experience between a buyer and a seller. But as the Tesla example reveals, a payment is often the first dance move in a long-term relationship between the two parties. Warranties, return policies and government regulations mean that buyer and seller can be married for years.      Put differently, purchases are in many ways like debts, not payments.      See also: JP Koning - Regulation Could Actually Help Tether      Defining all of the conditions of a long-term debt relationship is easy when the U.S. dollar is involved. The dollar is stable. But bitcoin is an awkward unit for denominating debts. Bitcoin could collapse next week. Or its price might rise to $1 million. All the risks and rewards of holding bitcoin have to be apportioned to the various counterparties over the lifetime of the contract. That gets complicated.      In Tesla's case, a more equitable way to structure its long-term relationship with bitcoiner customers might be to allow them to share the upside. If bitcoin’s price rises by a factor of 10, then a buyer who spent $50,000 worth of bitcoin on a Tesla merits a $500,000 refund if the Tesla proves to be a lemon.      But this introduces a new problem. Tesla would have to cope with a wave of returns as bitcoiners sabotage their $50,000 Teslas in the hope of getting a big $500,000 bitcoin bonanza!    Better to pay for a Tesla with money that doesn't fork, rise by 10,000% or collapse.    Alternatively, if a customer spends $50,000 worth of bitcoins on a car, Tesla could promise to refund a flat $50,000, even if bitcoin falls in value. However, Elon Musk has tweeted that all bitcoin payments will be retained by Tesla as bitcoin rather than being converted into fiat money. This is a big change from other corporate ""we accept bitcoin"" moments, which behind the scenes were just another way for companies to accept fiat from customers.      In light of this policy, it would be risky for Tesla to promise flat $50,000 refunds. Tesla’s debts to its bitcoin-paying customers would be denominated in dollars while its reserves would be in bitcoin. This foreign exchange risk would be costly for Tesla to absorb.      Finally, what happens if there's a split, say like the 2017 chain fork that brought us Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold? It's not apparent in Tesla's Terms & Conditions how it would pay out post-split lemon law refunds. A buyer who qualifies for a refund might end up receiving Bitcoin 1 from Tesla, not Bitcoin 2, and thus could lose a big chunk of the original purchase price of the malfunctioning Tesla.      Better to pay for a Tesla with money that doesn't fork, rise by 10,000%, or collapse. And that, in a nutshell, is why payments in bitcoin are unlikely to ever take off. The dollar is too easy.",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | BTG,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/29/youre-a-lemon-if-you-buy-a-tesla-with-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b004a043044f13b52dbbda0ba9769685fc08029f-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although most of the excitement has centered around Coinbase’s direct listing, especially because private sales have valued the exchange at approximately $100 billion, perhaps the more interesting company that investors should analyze is BlockFi.      Unlike Coinbase, which operates as an exchange for both retail and institutional clients, BlockFi is essentially a modern-day crypto bank (without insurance) that pays account holders significantly higher interest than traditional banks. It is able to pay such high levels of interest because it’s charging even higher rates on the lending side. As long as BlockFi continues to successfully capture the spread between the rates it pays and the rates it collects, it should be able to remain profitable.    Thomas Meyer is the head of marketing for Cove Markets. He previously worked for Peak6 and Spire Trading as an equity options trader. He holds investments in bitcoin and ether.    Outside investors and venture capital firms have taken notice. Earlier this month, BlockFi raised $350 million through a Series D round co-led by Bain Capital Ventures. Based on that raise, the company is valued at approximately $3 billion.      So, all is well, right? Not quite. Despite the company’s strong business model and experienced leaders, there are significant risks that customers need to understand.    'Extreme market conditions'    Several analysts and influencers within the crypto space are excited about the returns that might be generated this year. In fact, according to the four-year cycle theory, this is the year where traders may once again experience the euphoria that occurred in 2017. Plan B’s stock-to-flow model suggests that bitcoin could reach six figures at some point this year.      If that does happen, there will likely be some wild swings on the way there, just as there were in 2013 and 2017. Networks will be congested, Ethereum gas fees will be outrageous, and trading platforms will become overwhelmed with the amount of traffic. While those are problems that traders can deal with, one issue they won’t accept is having their ability to withdraw suspended. But that’s exactly the risk that BlockFi lists in its interest-bearing account terms:    BlockFi and our third-party partners may experience cyber-attacks, extreme market conditions or other operational or technical difficulties that could result in the immediate halt of transfers and withdrawals of cryptocurrency either temporarily or permanently. BlockFi is not and will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred by you as a result of such cyber-attacks, operational or technical difficulties or suspensions of transfer or withdrawals.    While some of those risks are expected, having withdrawals turned off due to volatility is problematic for a few reasons. Given BlockFi’s extremely limited selection of cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, LINK and stablecoins), customers may want to transfer funds to pursue trading opportunities elsewhere. In fact, during normal times it still takes more than 24 hours to receive a withdrawal and significantly longer on the weekends.      If a customer submits a withdrawal request on a weekday (Monday-Thursday) before 5 p.m. ET, the withdrawal won’t be processed until 8 p.m. ET on the following business day. If the withdrawal request is submitted on Friday, it won’t be processed until Monday by 8 p.m. ET. The weekend lag is odd considering that crypto trades 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Why does it take so long?      See also: Thomas Meyer - Sorry Coinbase, You’re Not Worth $100B      BlockFi states that the delay is for a security hold, but each account is know your customer-verified at opening. Exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken process transfers almost instantly, so BlockFi should be able to do so as well. This is where the company’s business model and risk management process come into question.      One of the main points highlighted in the company’s mission statement is transparency builds trust. BlockFi claims to communicate transparently in all aspects when it deals with teams, clients and investors. However, the company’s website doesn’t list many details on the risk management framework for managing assets. When asked about that on a recent “On The Brink” podcast, Zac Prince, BlockFi’s CEO, said the reason for that was nobody wants to read it. That’s not exactly true because customers with large account balances absolutely want to know whether their money is safe. Blind trust only goes so far.    Are Celsius and Gemini a threat?    Within centralized finance (CeFi), BlockFi and Celsius have been the most widely used services for customers wanting to earn passive income on their crypto assets. Interestingly, Celsius Network was recently valued at $3.1 billion by Alpha Sigma Capital, which puts it at about the same valuation as BlockFi.      Although both platforms operate in much the same way, Celsius does offer several advantages. The first advantage is withdrawals are processed on the same day. The second advantage is while Celsius pays interest on 39 coins, BlockFi only does so on 10 coins. In addition, earlier this week, BlockFi announced it would decrease interest rates for BTC and ETH. This will sting the most for crypto whales as large balances are most impacted. However, much like BlockFi, Celsius is not without risk. Last year, CoinDesk published an article detailing a few questionable practices in which the company engages such as giving out un-collateralized loans and re-hypothecating funds used as collateral.      See also: Crypto Lender BlockFi Registers Bitcoin Trust With SEC      Another important factor that customers may want to consider is that BlockFi pays out interest on a monthly basis, whereas Celsius pays out weekly. All else being equal, I’d much rather get paid four times a month and let that interest compound.      Until recently, BlockFi and Celsius were the main players in the CeFi lending space. But in early February, Gemini launched Gemini Earn, a program that will allow customers to earn up to 7.4% APY on their crypto assets. Although the program offers more coins than BlockFi, the rates are also significantly less. Given the low rates, Gemini Earn probably isn’t a threat to steal business away from either BlockFi or Celsius at this time. However, it could mean that existing Gemini customers who were considering using other services may opt to keep their assets with Gemini.    Not your keys    As BlockFi continues to inch closer to a possible initial public offering, it’s important to get a handle on what the company offers, what the risks are and whether competitors are positioned to steal market share. Although most investors are eager to earn passive income on their crypto, they should fully understand the risks of keeping crypto assets on a centralized platform like BlockFi.      There is a common saying in crypto that investors might want to take to heart: “Not your keys, not your coins.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Thomas Meyer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/29/does-blockfis-risk-justify-the-reward,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The biggest cryptocurrency by market value is trading higher on the day, near $58,000 at press time, with the daily chart showing a bullish breakout out from a two-week-long descending channel identified by trendlines connecting March 14 and March 20 highs and March 16 and March 25 highs.  Prices have risen by nearly $2,000 since Reuters reported earlier Monday Visa's decision to allow the use of stablecoin USDC to settle transactions on its payment network.  USDC is the second-biggest stablecoin, with a market capitalization of about $11 billion, as per data source CoinGecko.  According to Reuters, by adding support for the stablecoin, Visa has stripped out the need to convert the cryptocurrencies into traditional money for settling transactions on its network.  The latest Visa news comes five days after Tesla's CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the electric maker would accept bitcoin as payment for its cars. Bitcoin jumped from $54,700 to above $56,000 after Tesla's announcement only to surrender gains amid heightened uncertainty ahead of Friday's monthly options expiry.  With the options expiry now out of the way, bitcoin's price gains seen at press time look sustainable in the near term – especially with blockchain data indicating the market sentiment is bullish.  With the channel resistance flipped into support, the focus is now on the psychological level of $60,000.

42434065,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7cdh,1617008400,"Visa Settles USDC Transaction on Ethereum, Plans Rollout to Partners","Visa has processed a cryptocurrency payment directly on the Ethereum blockchain as part of a new service the payment giant plans to introduce to its partners later this year.      The move, the latest sign of increased adoption of digital currencies by the old-guard financial industry, bumped the price of bitcoin and ether roughly 5% each.      Per a press release shared with CoinDesk, Crypto.com sent a USDC stablecoin transaction on Ethereum to an account at Anchorage custody under Visa’s name. Crypto.com issues “crypto-backed” Visa cards that allow its users to spend the coins in their Crypto.com wallet.      United States dollar coin, or USDC, is a stablecoin pegged 1-to-1 with the dollar. It is the second-largest stablecoin with an $11 billion capitalization.      Usually, Crypto.com has to sell cryptocurrencies to cover its obligations to Visa in cash, but this new program will allow the company to pay in USDC. The pilot could be a bellwether for mainstream acceptance of crypto-native payment methods because it marks the first time Visa has accepted a cryptocurrency payment in lieu of cash for its services.      “Crypto-native fintechs want partners [that] understand their business and the complexities of digital currency form factors,” Visa Chief Product Officer Jack Forestell said in the press release. “The announcement today marks a major milestone in our ability to address the needs of fintechs managing their business in a stablecoin or cryptocurrency, and it’s really an extension of what we do every day, securely facilitating payments in all different currencies all across the world.”    Visa goes in on bitcoin, crypto    Of the credit card giants, Visa has been pushing the most aggressively into crypto.      The payment network’s fast-track program has furnished dozens of crypto companies with resources and Visa cards. In addition to Crypto.com, crypto companies BlockFi, Fold, Bitpanda and others have Visa cards with bitcoin-back rewards. One upstart called Moon allows its users to buy prepaid digital cards with Bitcoin’s Lightning network to use at any Visa-accepting online merchant.      Visa’s USDC settlement with Crypto.com comes almost two months after news surfaced that the payments company is building out APIs for banks and financial institutions to buy and sell cryptocurrencies for their clients using Visa’s network, the Ethereum blockchain and Anchorage’s custodial services.      Going forward, Visa plans to flesh out its crypto-native services by “support[ing] reconciliation and currency conversion for stablecoins such as USDC” and creating “settlement reports” with blockchain wallet addresses to verify transactions.      Visa also said in the press release that Anchorage will be its ""digital asset settlement agent” and that it will “integrate [its] treasury systems with Anchorage.”      “After further testing and additional conversations with clients, partners and members of the regulatory community, we hope to launch this capability for other partners in the year ahead,” Visa said in a blog post about the news.

42434058,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP7cVh,1617007715,Cosmos Investors Vote to Approve Inter-Blockchain Communication,"The long-awaited vision of the Cosmos blockchain has now been realized, as holders of the ATOM token have voted through inter-blockchain communication (IBC), enabling assets to transfer easily between blockchains.      The final vote to enable the feature was 112 million to 75, overwhelmingly in support of activation.      In the simplest terms, IBC enables messages to travel between blockchains that have implemented the standard. The most obvious use case in crypto is sending messages to transfer tokens off one chain and onto another.      ""At its core, IBC is a method of securely exchanging data between two independent (sovereign) blockchains. This means that any two blockchains that support IBC can send communication back and forth in a permissionless manner,"" Zarko Milosevic, chief scientist at the blockchain consultancy Informal Systems, told CoinDesk by email.      This development has the potential to open up opportunities in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, where a product on an application-specific blockchain could use an asset from a completely different chain.      For example, ATOM is the governance token for Cosmos, the blockchain built to enable IBC. ""Previously, ATOM was relegated to the Cosmos Hub with regard to its utility as a governance token. It is now transferable and interoperable with all blockchains that support IBC,"" Milosevic said.    Pent-up demand    One place ATOM may go: the Terra blockchain, which runs a DeFi savings account called Anchor. Terra could plug in to IBC and make ATOM one of the tokens its underlying money market will loan.      IBC was built into the Stargate upgrade enabled by the Cosmos ecosystem in February. ATOM holders, however, opted to let Stargate run a bit longer and do further testing before enabling IBC. The vote put IBC into effect on Cosmos.      There was no delay between the vote and the feature going live. ""Since it is a parameter change, it does not require for the chain to be halted,"" Milosevic explained.      The activation of IBC is not enough for all blockchains to work in conjunction with each other, though. IBC is a protocol that other blockchains can use, but they must upgrade to the IBC standard.      That is theoretically possible for any blockchain to do, but those built on Tendermint, the consensus model native to the Cosmos ecosystem, are likely to be the first to adopt the standard. Some of the blockchains that are built on Tendermint include Kava, Agoric, Akash, Foam and Crypto.com.      “It's like dropping a crystal into a supersaturated solution: The pent-up need for interconnection between chains will be unleashed,"" Dean Tribble, the CEO at Agoric, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson. ""Some of the most interesting connections will be between chains that we have never heard of, accomplishing things not currently feasible.”      Agoric is a secure smart contracts platform. It's not yet running in the wild, but its developers have tried IBC in tests.      Open-source cloud services provider Akash and crypto-trading app Crypto.com both told CoinDesk that each is technically ready to join IBC and should do so in a matter of weeks, pending approval by their respective token holders.    Mix and match    Cosmos' funding came from a 2017 initial coin offering that raised $17 million to support a cross-blockchain future. Its war chest appreciated dramatically thanks to deft treasury management. The project had a variety of leadership changes through a rocky 2020 but carried on.      The website Cosmos-Cap estimates the combined market capitalization for the ecosystem’s blockchains at over $60 billion, led by Binance Coin, Terra, Crypto.com and Cosmos itself.      ""Since IBC is modular by design, it can be easily extended to support more chains outside of the Tendermint ecosystem. For example, the modules needed to open IBC connections to the Polkadot and Kusama networks and other substrate based networks are under development,"" Milosevic wrote.      Similarly, the venture fund Multicoin Capital recently released a report on one blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem, Thorchain, a cross-chain decentralized exchange, in the same mold as DeFi staple Uniswap. Multicoin's Tushar Jain wrote in an email to CoinDesk about Cosmos' latest upgrade:      ""It is a huge deal. Through things like IBC and Thorchain's bridge to non-Cosmos protocols and other bridges like Solana's wormhole bridge, we will see the cross-chain future come to life,” Jain said.
