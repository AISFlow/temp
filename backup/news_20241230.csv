38323890,https://crypto.news/?p=14323417,1735602231,5 altcoins on the verge of joining the top 10 with massive growth,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Exploring 5 altcoins with the potential to join the top 10 rankings. Table of Contents XYZ: An altcoin with 7,400% growth potential Toncoin Shiba Inu Sui Hedera Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with some digital coins poised to make significant leaps. Several lesser-known cryptocurrencies are showing remarkable potential to climb the ranks. These altcoins are gaining momentum and could soon break into the top echelons of the market. XYZ: An altcoin with 7,400% growth potential XYZ is emerging as a serious contender for a top 10 position. This sports-driven, meme-powered project is breaking barriers, looking to combine the viral appeal of meme coins with the global fervor of sports betting. With its unique approach and massive growth potential, XYZ is gearing up to redefine the altcoin landscape. XYZ isn’t just another altcoin — it’s a project built to thrive at the intersection of two explosive trends: meme coins and sports. Picture the excitement of a billion-dollar sports betting market infused with the viral momentum of crypto memes. XYZVerse will create a unique ecosystem where sports enthusiasts and crypto degens unite, unlocking massive potential for growth and community engagement. Recognized among the best new meme projects, XYZ has proven it has what it takes to dominate this niche. The XYZ presale is where the action begins. With a projected 7,400% surge by the Token Generation Event (TGE), early adopters have a golden opportunity to secure their position before the token explodes. XYZ stands leagues ahead with a solid foundation: audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and plans for listings on major CEX and DEX platforms. With its unique value proposition and a rapidly growing community, XYZ is perfectly positioned to climb the ranks of the crypto market. The combination of transformative use cases, strong fundamentals, and an active user base makes this token a prime candidate for top-tier status. As XYZ continues to build momentum, it’s not just a hidden gem — it’s a shining star in the making. With its presale stages selling out at record speed, investors are looking to get in before XYZ cements its place among the top 10 altcoins. Interested investors can grab XYZ tokens and be part of the next crypto championship. Toncoin Toncoin is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized and open-source blockchain. It was originally developed by Telegram as the Telegram Open Network with the ‘Gram’ token. However, Telegram discontinued the project in May 2020 due to regulatory issues. Since then, the non-commercial TON Foundation and community enthusiasts have taken over its development. Based on historical price movements, Toncoin’s price could reach as high as $30.30 by 2025. This represents a potential gain of 348.18% compared to today’s price. By 2030, it could hit up to $26.04, a potential gain of 285.24%. Toncoin’s ambitious goals and strong technology make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Its focus on speed, security, and low fees sets it apart from many other cryptocurrencies. With strong community support and ongoing development, Toncoin might become a significant player as the crypto market evolves. You might also like: XYZVerse prepares to dominate 2025 with a 25,000% surge, leaving SOL and AVAX behind Shiba Inu Shiba Inu was inspired by Dogecoin’s success but runs on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it access to a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum opens doors to exciting possibilities. Projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, show its potential beyond being a simple meme token. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a governance system where holders can have a say in development. In the current market cycle, where utility and real-world applications are gaining importance, SHIB’s approach sets it apart from other meme coins. Sui Sui is a blockchain platform designed for global use, offering security, power, and scalability. At its core, Sui uses a novel object-centric data model. This allows for efficient transaction processing. It also employs the Move programming language, known for its security features. Moreover, Sui focuses on user experience, aiming to remove common barriers in blockchain interactions with features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions. In a market where coins like Ethereum face high fees and slow speeds, Sui offers a promising alternative. Its technology could make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Hedera Instead of using a traditional blockchain, Hedera uses something called hashgraph. This makes transactions really fast, cheap, and good for the environment. There’s no mining involved, so it uses less energy. HBAR is used to pay for transactions and to keep the network secure through Proof of Stake. Hedera’s technology promises quicker and more secure transactions than many other coins. Its low fees and high speed make it attractive for businesses, especially in finance. While some worry that its patented technology might limit community involvement compared to open-source projects like Ethereum, big companies are backing Hedera. As the crypto world looks for more efficient and eco-friendly options, HBAR could stand out as a promising choice for the future. Conclusion Though TON, SHIB, SUI, and HBAR are promising in the 2024 bull run, XYZ is the first all-sport meme coin, aiming for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans globally.

Per El Pais , “digital” alternatives are now displacing the “gray dollar” for Venezuelan citizens. Venezuelans Still Keen on Crypto The report’s author noted that while the “crypto accepted here” signs that were “once prominent in shops, hotels, and restaurants in Venezuela” have long disappeared, “this does not mean that Venezuela’s crypto economy is not flourishing.” The media outlet wrote that Venezuelans are increasingly turning to Bitcoin (BTC) and other coins to make easy transactions, receive remittances, and “take refuge from the devaluation of the [fiat] bolivar.” The newspaper added that while crypto exchanges are “not illegal” in the country, they are also “unregulated.” The Government of Nicolás Maduro reportedly “tolerates” unregulated crypto exchange “because it has become a way to bring foreign currency into the country.” The Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro with the late US President Jimmy Carter. (Source: Nicolás Maduro/Facebook) Maduro claimed victory in elections earlier this year. However, the United States has claimed that the elections were marred by “electoral fraud.” As a result, the newspaper explained, Maduro’s inauguration on January 10, 2025, has become “a date that is generating political and financial tension.” Maduro once pursued an aggressively pro-crypto policy, and even spearheaded the launch of a state-operated cryptoasset, the Petro (PTR). Reuters: Venezuela Opposition Adviser Holed Up in Argentine Residence Calls It 'Prison' https://t.co/j2EeDllp2h — nuprizm (@nuprizm) December 29, 2024 Mass Arrests However, this policy fell victim to widespread corruption, and led to mass arrests and the PTR’s eventual shutdown. But Maduro has recently spoken of “returning” to the crypto “path.” And the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis noted that “in the second quarter of 2024,” the Venezuelan Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) , and USDT markets grew by “an impressive 110% compared to the same period last year.” Chainalysis claims this rate is “higher than in any country in the [LATAM] region.” UN orders Venezuela not to destroy election vote tallies https://t.co/aE3KPPNJ0L — BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) December 4, 2024 $20 Billion Inflow The media outlet explained that in 2024, an “estimated volume of $20 billion” has “entered the Venezuelan ecosystem” through crypto markets. This represents a sizeable chunk of the nation’s estimated $100 billion 2024 Gross Domestic Product. Despite its well-documented financial woes, Venezuela has battled against hyperinflation with some success. But the economy remains highly dependent on oil exports, and the specter of inflation refuses to vanish entirely. Inflation rose by around 4% in October, shooting up from under 1% in September. Some estimate that November ushered in a steeper rise yet. Venezuela's monthly inflation rate returned to double digits in November: 12.5%, a figure that had not been recorded since the beginning of 2023, according to the Venezuelan Financial Observatory (OVF). pic.twitter.com/l3rNCbxZPj — BowTiedMara (@BowTiedMara) December 6, 2024 And this, like elsewhere in LATAM, has driven many citizens to the stablecoins markets. Chainalysis claimed that between July 2023 and July 2024, 47% of crypto transactions worth under $10,000 involved stablecoins. “Stablecoins have become popular because they are pegged to more stable fiat currencies, such as the US dollar. They offer a hedge against the volatility of the Venezuelan bolivar. They play a crucial role in daily transactions and remittances.” Dan Cartolin, Enterprise Account Executive, Chainalysis. Guyana’s economy is the fastest-growing in the world, driven by a booming oil sector. But Venezuela is laying claim to its neighbor’s oil-rich region and the threat of a “resource curse” looms large.

The newspaper quoted a Venezuelan citizen named Vanesa as explaining that she provides crypto exchange services to her countrypeople using platforms like Binance. However, Vanesa lamented that the crackdown on crypto exchanges and the government’s own crypto operations have left people like her in limbo. The newspaper quoted an unnamed Latin American crypto exchange as stating that it had tried to apply for a virtual asset service provider license in Venezuela. But this platform said that it had given up because it was “impossible to deal with sudden changes” in the regulatory guidelines. In the wake of the crackdown, crypto-related “posters” have been “taken down” everywhere. Operations involving crypto are “becoming more discreet,” Vanesa added, concluding: “Everything is in the grey zone here.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

BlockDAG’s New Year Raffle Could Make That Happen! Can Solana & Dogecoin Price Predictions Beat This Chance?,"Solana’s technical analysis highlights its resilience and steady momentum as it aims to reclaim the $200 level. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price predictions remain mixed, with some expecting a surge beyond $2.28, while others suggest it may stabilize around $0.33. But all eyes are on BlockDAG (BDAG) , stealing the spotlight with its presale nearing $173.5 million and a 2025 mainnet launch.

Solana Technical Analysis: Growth Snapshot Solana’s technical analysis shows a strong upward trend despite a slight drop to $187.83, a 4.84% decrease.

This Engineer Thinks So,"Although Bitcoin is having a rough moment this week, with prices oscillating between $93k and $96k, at least one popular crypto commentator is predicting a massive price run soon. According to Ted Boydston, the market should prepare for a manic bull run in the coming days, with Bitcoin’s price targeting $225k. Related Reading: Bitcoin As A Strategic Asset? CryptoQuant CEO Questions US’s Next Move Boydston highlights the price oscillator on M2, which offers real-time buy and sell signals for traders and investors. He then explained that the tool recently displayed a buy signal. And if history repeats itself, Boydston expects Bitcoin to begin its price surge, benefitting holders and investors. Bitcoin And Its M2 Price Oscillator Chart Boydston, a popular crypto commentator and engineer, offers a fascinating insight into Bitcoin’s recent price action. Although Bitcoin’s price has recently slipped, he sees a potential price surge soon. Except for the 2016 Bitcoin cycle, a price oscillator on M2 has provided well timed buy and sell signals. The oscillator recently flashed a buy. If history rhymes, this means money printing and Bitcoin’s manic phase should start soon. pic.twitter.com/61RpHYudIw — Ted Boydston (@tboydsto) December 28, 2024 Boydston posted an M2 price oscillator graph on Twitter/X, indicating a Buy signal. Since the M2 money stock considers liquid cash circulation, including checking deposits, physical cash (M1), money markets, and savings, the chart provides an interesting perspective on an asset’s possible direction. As such, this technical chart and indicator offer helpful insights into the possible performance of assets, including those in the crypto niche. A Bitcoin Bull Run Soon? Readers can find the oscillator taken from the PPO of M2 at the lower panel using a shared screenshot. The chart displayed red for 2023 and most of 2024 but flashes a green or potential buy signal as the year is about to close. Bitcoin’s M2 price oscillator is flashing a BUY signal! With the exception of the 2016 Bitcoin cycle, this indicator has an insane accuracy. If history repeats, this could signal the start of money printing and another major BTC pump. Ignore it at your own risk! pic.twitter.com/zsepPXjLH0 — BitcoinHyper (@BitcoinHypers) December 28, 2024 Boydston argues that a signal like this often leads to the asset’s price surge and eventually paves the way for a bull run. Investors can expect increased volatility and Bitcoin price appreciation if this scenario plays out. Traders and investors have relied on this technical analysis for years, offering correct predictions, except in 2016. The chart didn’t flash the buy signal then, but the price went up after the Bitcoin halving event. Bitcoin’s Future Price Action Crypto analysts targeted the $100k mark for Bitcoin a few months ago. Now that this was already achieved in December, many analysts are setting their sights on new targets. Some analysts claim that Bitcoin’s short-term target is $150k, while others speculate that the asset could hit $1 million.

38322823,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635187,1735599454,Nvidia to open-source Run:ai after finally closing its acquisition,"US chipmaking firm Nvidia has finally closed the $700 million acquisition of Run:ai, an Israeli software company that makes it easier for customers to orchestrate GPU clouds for AI, after facing some regulatory obstacles. Now, Nvidia is reportedly going to open-source the software. Run:ai posted the latest news on its website and revealed Nvidia’s plans to open source its software. Regulators from both sides of the Atlantic probed Nvidia on antitrust grounds While neither of the companies explained the intention, Venture Beat suggests this might not be hard to figure out as Nvidia has ballooned to be the most valuable company in the world at $3.56 trillion. Despite its size, it also becomes difficult for the chip-making giant to acquire companies because of antitrust oversight. The acquisition faced some hurdles after the EU Commission indicated in October that Nvidia would need to get approvals and antitrust clearance for the transaction due to the raised concerns that the proposed transaction would undermine competition within the sectors in which the two companies operate. After some rigorous screening, the EU said it approved the proposed acquisition of the Israeli startup saying the transaction would raise no competition concerns in the EEA. According to Reuters , the EU’s probe into the deal focused on activities that could strengthen Nvidia’s control over GPUs, sought-after chips that could divide and process computer tasks, but eventually concluded that the deal would not raise any such concerns in the EEA. The Department of Justice also investigated Nvidia over the transaction on antitrust grounds. Now, after finally sealing the deal, a Nvidia spokesperson only said in a statement: “We’re delighted to welcome the Run:ai team to Nvidia.” However, Run:ai founders Omri Geller and Ronen Dar indicated in a statement that open-sourcing the software will help the community build better AI, faster. “While Run:ai currently supports only Nvidia GPUs, open-sourcing the software will enable it to extend its availability to the entire AI ecosystem.” Geller and Dar. The Israeli startup founders also added that this will continue to help their customers get the most of their AI infrastructure and offer the ecosystem maximum flexibility, efficiency, and utilization for GPU systems, whenever they are. The Nvidia – Run:ai transaction to help customers orchestrate their AI infrastructure The two founders also revealed that they will continue to strengthen their partnerships and work alongside the ecosystem to give customers various AI solutions and platform choices. “True to our open-platform philosophy, as part of Nvidia, we will keep empowering AI teams with the freedom to choose the tools, platforms, and frameworks that best suit their needs,” said Geller and Dar. The Israel-based startup revealed that its goal when it started in 2018 was to be a driving force in the AI revolution and empower organizations to unlock the full potential of their AI infrastructure. According to VB , the company helps its customers orchestrate their AI infrastructure, enhance efficiency, and utilization as well as boost the productivity of their teams. “We are thrilled to build on this momentum, now as part of Nvidia. AI and accelerated computing are transforming the world at an unprecedented pace, and we believe this is just the beginning,” the Run:ai founders said. “GPUs and AI infrastructure will remain at the forefront of driving these transformative innovations and joining Nvidia provides us an extraordinary opportunity to carry forward a joint mission of helping humanity solve the world’s greatest challenges,” they added. While Nvidia has for long been making graphics chips that have become useful in running AI software, the company is also now emphasizing software. Nvidia controls about 80% market share of AI graphics processors. The Run:ai acquisition therefore now relates to giving their customers efficiency and flexibility for GPU orchestration software. The two companies have been collaborating since 2020 and have joint customers. Nvidia first announced the acquisition of the Israeli startup in April in a deal worth $700 million, a price tag that was to be reviewed by the bloc following requests by Italian regulators under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR). This delayed the conclusion of the transaction as it was under probe before it got approved earlier this month. When announcing its plans, Nvidia said the deal would help customers make more efficient use of their computing resources.

This comprehensive framework introduces uniform rules for crypto-assets and service providers, aiming to enhance investor protection, ensure market transparency, and prevent financial crimes such as money laundering. Under MiCA, crypto platforms, stablecoin issuers, and other service providers must obtain licenses to operate within the EU, adhere to strict governance standards, and maintain segregated client funds to safeguard against insolvency risks. Stablecoin issuers are required to hold reserves equivalent to their issued tokens and meet liquidity requirements, including holding at least 30% of their reserves in traditional banks. The regulation also imposes transparency requirements, such as publishing whitepapers detailing risks and operational frameworks. The framework comes as Bitcoin reaches $100,000, reflecting heightened activity in the crypto market. MiCA also addresses lessons from the FTX collapse by mandating stricter safeguards. While MiCA strengthens consumer protections and harmonizes rules across the 27 EU member states, it does not extend the same level of safeguards as traditional financial instruments. The framework excludes decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a transitional period of up to 18 months has been granted for full compliance, with Spain opting for a 12-month transition. ESMA will oversee enforcement. Industry leaders have welcomed MiCA as a step toward legitimizing the crypto sector, though concerns remain about the high compliance costs for smaller providers.

This surge in inflows has pushed total assets in U.S. ETFs to exceed $10 trillion, reflecting a 30% increase from the beginning of the year. The growth was driven by strong demand for passive investment strategies, including S&P 500 funds, and the introduction of new products such as Bitcoin ETFs, which added $50 billion in assets and contributed significantly to the inflows. Globally, ETF inflows reached $1.4 trillion in 2024. Meanwhile, traditional stockpicking funds experienced a record $450 billion in outflows as investors increasingly opted for lower-cost, passively managed alternatives. The shift highlights a broader trend of investors moving away from actively managed mutual funds, which have struggled to justify their higher fees amid underperformance relative to benchmarks.

Recent events like the decline of the TON network after blistering inflows led to this trend. The price of TRX is also expected to jump following bull signals as it moves out of the ‘overbought’ zone. A new CryptoQuant report shows the Tron network outpacing other major blockchains in the last three months. In that time frame, monthly volumes totaled $182 million, $167 million, and $135 million in October, November, and December, respectively. The network’s popularity among retail users is rising due to its efficiency and cost. Institutions have also played a part as inflows lead to more market transactions. According to the analysts, the decline of TON enabled Tron to take the top spot, coupled with Tether’s activity. In previous months, Telegram-based games took over the ecosystem, with the network being a huge beneficiary. Inflow to the ecosystem began to decline as momentum shifted to other networks. Furthermore, Tron’s USDT volume is another driver of bullish activity. This comes on the heels of retail crypto traders ramping up gains on the back of the market surge. What Next For TRX Price? Amid huge inflows, TRX surged to new highs, recording huge community activities. The asset’s rise was linked to its transaction volumes, and gains were seen in wider crypto events. The United States election was a major driver of crypto prices this quarter. After the polls, the asset hit a new all-time high above $0.45 before sharply declining. It should be noted that Justin Sun’s announced of a $30 million investment in Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance. However, the wider market crash saw the asset record a 40% correction, although the bull signal increased on-chain data. According to CryptoQuant, a custom indicator based on the combination of RSI and MACD points to a move away from the overbought zone. This is a sign of incoming bull activity with healthier conditions from investors. Ahead of next year’s projected rally, institutional investors are repositioning assets and whales ramping up tokens. “ The next steps are crucial. If we see an “oversold” signal in the coming days, it could present a solid buying opportunity for those aiming to capitalize on the continuation of Tron’s bullish momentum. For now, patience is key.

Rumors about a customer repayment plan for January 2025 have been dismissed by one of its major creditors, causing even more confusion. The news had circulated over the weekend. Many claimed that FTX would begin repayments on January 3 and distribute $16 billion to creditors within 60 days. However, a key creditor, Sunil, denied these claims, saying the timeline and payout were inaccurate. Sunil Clears the Air on January Repayment Plan In a recent X post, Sunil, an FTX creditor advocate, denied claims about a January repayment date. He explained that the date was wrong and provided an update on FTX’s recovery. He revealed the exchange has recovered $13 billion from debtors, potentially reaching $14 billion by March 2025. However, he warned creditors not to expect an immediate payout as the situation remains uncertain. The confusion stems from FTX’s plan to keep half the recovered funds. Sunil explained that FTX will hold 50% of the $13 billion for future needs, leaving just $7 billion for the first round of payouts. This means the repayment will be slower and smaller than expected, with creditors initially receiving only part of their claims. FTX Debtors to Receive Full Reimbursement in 2-3 Years For those hoping for full compensation soon, Sunil added more caution. He said that reimbursing creditors could take two to three years, much longer than the earlier promise of quick repayment. This has left many customers questioning the truth behind FTX’s recovery plans. Amid the confusion, many users are looking for a clearer repayment schedule. Earlier this month, a tweet from the official FTX account suggested repayments would start in January. This led a user to ask Sunil about the conflicting information. With no clear answers yet, these uncleared questions fuel ongoing frustrations. Legal Hiccups and Missed Opportunities To add another layer to the ongoing controversy, earlier decisions in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings have left many creditors feeling cheated. Earlier, presiding judge John Dorsey made a notable ruling. He allowed the exchange to repay creditors based on the monetary value of a user’s balance at the time of the bankruptcy filing. This meant creditors missed out on the potential profits from the rise in cryptocurrency prices, especially for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). When FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, Bitcoin was priced at $16,871 and Solana at $16.25. This is much lower than their values as of writing.

38322209,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99549,1735598302,BTC Skyrocketing Rally? Bitcoin Reserves on Exchanges Shrink To New Lows,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price faces a potentially massive rally as on-chain factors remain positive. Whales and institutional investors have repositioned assets to favor an uphill narrative ahead of 2025. This year, the crypto market dominated financial spaces with multiple all-time highs for some assets. Bitcoin Reserves Plunge to 2.4 Million BTC On-chain data shows declining Bitcoin reserves across exchanges, tipping a higher price action. This year, reserves on centralized exchanges dropped to 2.4 million from 3 million in January. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January led to declining numbers. Sequel to the approvals, the BTC price rose to new highs above $7k. Most whales withdrew assets from exchanges as funds trickled into the ecosystem. Outflows from exchanges point to an increased price action due to whales considering long-term holdings. Conversely, inflow to these platforms leads to sell pressure because of the popular sentiment associated with the transfers. Crypto analyst KriptoBaykusv2 explained that the presence of institutional investors sparked the status quo, seeing rapid inflows as a sign of more gains. Most traditional investors bought the dip and have maintained a hodl strategy. On the other hand, retail investors tend to move tokens on slight price changes, leading to BTC redistribution. “ This shift is particularly evident among institutional investors, who have increasingly embraced the “hodl” approach, demonstrating strong confidence in Bitcoin’s future potential. As reserves dwindled, Bitcoin’s price experienced a remarkable surge. Starting the year around $40K, the price accelerated in November, surpassing the $100K milestone and setting a new peak at $104K.” As exchange balances drop, Bitcoin miner reserves spike following the price surge. The last bear market saw miners sell reserves to stay afloat. High prices result in a hodl strategy to maximize gains. Bitcoin Bulls Expect Massive Price Upticks Bitcoin enthusiasts have projected a massive price surge next year due to bullish industry and on-chain factors. The transfer of assets to other custodians shows a supply shock, which could be the catalyst for the needed price action. Several whales have also ramped up accumulations alongside top firms releasing their 2025 market outlook. In a new release, Bitfinex analysts noted that the market is positioned to see a price upswing, hitting $200K due to institutional activities.

While established tokens like Shiba Inu have already made waves, new contenders like BTFD Coin and SLERF are emerging with massive potential. BTFD Coin’s presale has been particularly impressive, raising over $4.6 million within its first month, and analysts are already predicting major gains. This all reminds us of the 1973 economic collapse when the world faced a significant downturn, but smart investors who bought during the chaos later reaped huge rewards. Is history repeating itself? If you’re wondering which meme coins offer the best investment opportunities right now, you’re in the right place. In this article, we’ll take a close look at BTFD Coin, Shiba Inu, and SLERF, comparing their presales, potential returns, and future prospects. We’ll also highlight BTFD Coin’s recent performance, which is turning heads as it continues to break records. With its exciting presale, community-focused features, and an all-new P2E game , BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin – it’s a movement. Meme coins have come a long way, from being niche crypto jokes to becoming a dominant force in the market. Over the years, we’ve seen projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu make waves, and now BTFD Coin and SLERF are looking to take that momentum even further. BTFD Coin, in particular, is building on this wave, offering not just meme coin appeal, but a gamified experience, staking rewards , and a referral program that could take it to the next level. Investors are flocking to it, and it’s easy to see why – it’s one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential right now. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolutionising Crypto As the 13th stage of the presale unfolds, the coin is available for $0.000142. With over $4.6 million raised, the presale reached impressive milestones, including $1 million in under 10 days and $2.5 million in less than 14 days. The project boasts a vibrant community of 7,000+ holders, with more than 60 billion coins sold so far. What sets BTFD Coin apart from other meme coins is its focus on building a vibrant community and offering utilities like a play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a referral program. This isn’t just about buying coins and waiting for a pump; it’s about engaging with the platform and earning rewards as you go. And with a killer bonus code – BIG50 – you can grab 50% extra coins . Looking back to the 1973 economic collapse, it’s easy to see how BTFD Coin’s current presale mirrors that kind of opportunity. When markets were down in the ’70s, those who bought into undervalued assets found themselves in a prime position when the economy recovered. Today, we’re seeing a similar scenario with BTFD Coin, where smart investors are buying in early to take advantage of the low presale price. And with the presale tally already crossing $4 million, it’s clear that this meme coin is gaining serious traction. BTFD Coin offers one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential , and if you’re not on board yet, now’s the time to act. As the presale progresses, the price will only rise, so getting in with the BIG50 bonus code is a no-brainer. Don’t miss out on this golden opportunity – it’s only going to get better from here. Don’t miss the BIG50 festive bonus! Use code BIG50 to earn 50% more tokens. For example, purchasing 100 coins will reward you with 150. Secure $BTFD now and set yourself up for success. Shiba Inu: The King of Meme Coins Shiba Inu is often regarded as the “Doge killer” for its rapid rise in popularity and its reputation as one of the top meme coins on the market. Since its launch, Shiba Inu has seen massive growth, making early investors some serious profits. However, while Shiba Inu’s community and ecosystem are impressive, its potential for exponential growth is starting to plateau as the market matures. At its peak, Shiba Inu saw a massive surge in price, with people scrambling to get in before it skyrocketed. But now, its price has stabilised, and while it still has a large and loyal community, many investors are looking for the next big thing. That’s where BTFD Coin comes in. With its innovative approach, including a P2E game, staking rewards, and an aggressive presale strategy, BTFD Coin is challenging the status quo and could easily surpass Shiba Inu in terms of growth potential. Just like Shiba Inu, BTFD Coin has captured the imagination of meme coin enthusiasts, but it stands out because of its unique offerings that provide value beyond just holding coins. This focus on utility, community engagement, and rewards is a key differentiator. BTFD Coin’s presale has already raised over $4 million, and its trajectory shows no signs of slowing down. It’s one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential, and if you’re still hanging on to Shiba Inu, now might be the time to diversify and add some BTFD to your portfolio. SLERF: The Underdog with Serious Potential SLERF is another up-and-coming meme coin that’s gaining traction in the crypto world. While it hasn’t yet reached the same level of recognition as BTFD Coin or Shiba Inu, its presale has been steadily growing, attracting a loyal following. Like BTFD Coin, SLERF offers a community-driven approach, with an emphasis on decentralisation and rewards for holders. SLERF has made a strong start in its presale, but it still has a long way to go before it can catch up with the kind of explosive growth that BTFD Coin has seen. With a similar low entry price and early-stage promise, SLERF presents an interesting option for investors looking for a meme coin with 100x potential. However, when comparing SLERF to BTFD Coin, it’s clear that BTFD’s presale strategy, utility offerings, and community-driven incentives put it in a prime position to outperform SLERF in the coming months. Both projects have a lot of potential, but BTFD Coin’s presale has already proven itself to be one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential, thanks to its early success and growing community.

Despite a fabulous rally in November, the entire market pulled back, and BTC now trades at around $93,000. Altcoins have dominated the headlines recently with continued gains as we near the altcoin season. Large-cap altcoins, including Cardano (ADA), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Stellar (XLM), grabbed attention for their immense gains in November and have the market on their toes as to what will happen with their prices when we finally enter the altcoin season. Join us as we explore the top gainers and potential winners as the altcoin season inches closer. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is another major gainer since Donald Trump’s election victory. On-chain metrics show Cardano’s weekly active addresses elevated since the crypto market rally triggered by Trump’s win on November 6 began. The surge in network usage and whale buying activity has resulted in a bullish outlook for ADA. ADA further surged after the Cardano blockchain developers, the Cardano Foundation, released an updated proposal for the Cardano Constitution to improve network governance. The revised proposal includes changes to constitutional workshops, social media discussion, and expert and community feedback. The changes aim to “improve the accessibility and clarity of the Cardano governance framework,” shifting its focus to a less technical audience. Interest in Cardano (ADA) surged after its founder, Charles Hoskinson, revealed plans to help shape US crypto policy under Donald Trump’s incoming administration. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM) made headlines in recent months for its massive gains. The Stellar network is similar to the Ripple (XRP) network - a decentralised payment platform and cryptocurrency that facilitates quick and low-cost cross-border payments, promoting financial inclusion for individuals and businesses globally. The Stellar network was created to support digital representations of any currency but has its native token called Lumens (XLM). Developed as a fork of the Ripple protocol, Stellar aims to create a global network connecting financial institutions, payment processors, and individual users, making cross-border money transfer easier and providing access to essential financial services. XLM, in conjunction with XRP, is expected to play a significant role in the new global financial system. XRP is uniquely designed to optimize institutional liquidity for cross-border transactions. At the same time, XLM’s infrastructure was built to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions and retail-level remittances efficiently. Financial experts envision a two-tiered monetary framework using XRP and XLM at different levels for specific purposes. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $12.4 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 230%. SHIB is also a proud member of the Solana network and is Husky Inu’s best friend. The memecoin quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 14th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). This decentralized, community-led project and its native token, SHIB, quickly gained the attention of its dedicated community of investors thanks to its charm and support from industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Husky Inu (HINU) Expected Surge Upon Exchange Listing As BTC trades at around $93,000 and top altcoins reach new heights, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest Solana-based memecoin to grace the market. Husky Inu was created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging this powerful blockchain. The project and its native token, HINU , want to make their mark on the saturated memecoin market by building a supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, and the fundraising has attracted a fair amount of attention. Since going live, the presale has generated over $680,000 and will soon reach its fundraising target. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting.

38321873,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376647,1735597566,Sky (MakerDAO) Hits New Highs in Fees and Revenue,"December has been a breakthrough month for MakerDAO, with data from the decentralized finance (DeFi) analytics platform DeFiLlama showing it set new records in fees and revenues. According to the data , MakerDAO reached a peak of $40.86 million in fees, a key metric of user activity, and $26.77 million in revenue, reflecting retained earnings, between December 1 and December 31. A Historic Month for MakerDAO 2024 has also been the crypto lending protocol’s best year since its inception, making about $304 million in fees and over $174 million in revenue. At that time, the highest amount recorded for fees was in April, when the protocol received $32.62 million, while its best month in terms of turnover was November when it made $18.91 million. However, December’s numbers beat both those figures by $8.24 million and $7.86 million, respectively, setting a new precedent for the platform. Interestingly, MakerDAO also saw its highest single-day performance on December 9, bringing in $1.67 million in levies and $1.18 million in income. These earnings have been driven primarily by interest payments on loans made on the protocol’s DAI stablecoin, reflecting the increasing demand for its lending services. In August, the platform announced it would rebrand to Sky after two years of development aimed at adding new functionalities and improving user interactions. It also introduced two new cryptocurrencies: USDS, a stablecoin that users could convert from their existing DAI holdings, and a new governance token named SKY. USDS has also been launched on Solana as a DeFi-native stablecoin. The network has the second-largest decentralized finance ecosystem after Ethereum, with about $8.5 billion locked into its DeFi projects. MKR’s Market Performance Elsewhere, Maker’s native asset MKR experienced a less-than-impressive December. According to data from CoinGecko, the token lost 16.8% of its value over the last 30 days, with its worst performance coming in the previous two weeks, where it dipped by more than 21%. In the last 24 hours, its price fluctuated between $1,488 and $1,547, finally settling at $1,522. The current price is 1.1% below its previous level from yesterday and remains more than 75% below its all-time high, recorded in May 2021. However, it still shows healthy market activity, with its latest one-day trading volume of $113.1 million helping it maintain a significant value with a market cap of $1.37 billion.

38321987,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99546,1735597401,Cardano Whales Scoop 160 Million ADA After Price Dip; What Do They Know?,"Cardano (ADA) has faced a notable price pullback after reaching a local high of $1.33 earlier this month following a stellar November, where ADA surged by an impressive 270%. The recent price decline is primarily attributed to profit-taking by investors after the rally. However, despite this dip, the blockchain continues to attract significant interest from major holders. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this trend in a Wednesday tweet, revealing that the dip has triggered a wave of accumulation among Cardano whales . “Cardano whales took profits on the way up from $1.15 to $1.33, but after $ADA dropped to $0.91, they started buying again. In fact, they’ve bought 160 million ADA since the dip,” Martinez wrote. Further data reveals that wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA, often called “sharks,” have seen a significant increase in activity during this accumulation phase. While frequently overlooked, this investor tier wields substantial influence in the market. Their cumulative buying or selling activity can notably impact price trends, often shaping broader market dynamics and signaling potential shifts in momentum. The continued accumulation of ADA reflects growing confidence in the Cardano ecosystem, which has been gaining momentum across multiple areas. Data from crypto analysis platform Taptools reveals that, over the past 30 days, the ecosystem has seen a substantial inflow of more than 3.78 million ADA into the market. During this period, Cardano has consistently maintained over 50,000 active daily traders on its decentralized exchanges (DEXs), underscoring its rising liquidity and expanding user base. Additionally, the surge in liquidity and active addresses signals a strong influx of new investors, further strengthening Cardano’s market position. Furthermore, as per data from DefiLlama, Cardano’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has seen remarkable growth this year, reaching approximately $708 million earlier this month and surpassing previous all-time highs. Cardano has also been steadily gaining prominence in the cryptocurrency space, driven by its advancements in sectors such as DeFi, smart contracts, and scaling solutions like Hydra, attracting significant interest from larger institutional investors. On the price front, the accumulation of ADA by whales during market dips is a positive signal for retail investors. It suggests that the perceived “floor” price is around $0.90, which has recently been breached as a key support level, indicating the potential for a price rebound. ADA was trading at $0.85 at press time, reflecting a 0.14% drop in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/cardano-whales-scoop-160-million-ada-after-price-dip-what-do-they-know/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

BlockDAG Referral Program Offers Up to 10% Instant USDT Cashback,"Among the top crypto coins, Chainlink, Shiba Inu, and BlockDAG are making waves with their latest updates. The latest Chainlink news highlights Smart Value Recapture (SVR), a solution helping DeFi protocols recover value lost to MEV, advancing its utility. On the other hand, a recent Shiba Inu update introduces “SHIB: The Metaverse,” a blockchain-powered platform fostering creativity and connection. Meanwhile, the BlockDAG (BDAG) Network’s Refer and Earn USDT program is gaining attention, offering instant USDT cashback of up to 10% for referrers and 6% for purchasers. This unique opportunity allows participants to earn while holding a promising layer-1 coin with substantial growth potential. Chainlink News: The Impact of Smart Value Recapture Chainlink news reflects the recent introduction of Smart Value Recapture (SVR), an oracle solution designed to help decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols recover value lost to Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) during liquidation events. MEV often benefits third parties, but SVR enables DeFi platforms to reclaim a portion of this lost value, improving their economic efficiency. Following the SVR announcement, LINK, Chainlink’s native token, experienced a 9% price surge, reaching $23.89, driven by market optimism. This Chainlink news is another indicator of LINK’s growing relevance among the top crypto coins. Shiba Inu Update: New Metaverse Project Takes Shape The latest Shiba Inu update reveals the launch of “SHIB: The Metaverse,” a virtual world powered by Shibarium’s layer-2 scaling solution. Described by marketing lead LUCIE as a platform for “creativity, connection, and ownership,” this project allows users to own, trade, and develop virtual real estate recorded on the blockchain. Additionally, participants can create custom avatars and connect globally with the SHIB community. While still in beta, this initiative reflects Shiba Inu’s expanding ecosystem and its continued efforts to diversify its projects beyond its meme coin origins. BlockDAG’s Referral Program Explained: Instant USDT Rewards for All The latest Refer and Earn USDT program launched by BlockDAG is designed to reward participants instantly and generously, offering cashback in USDT with every referral-based transaction. Referrers earn 6% cashback on the first purchase, with rates increasing incrementally up to 10% for multiple purchases made within a single 24-hour period. Buyers, too, benefit from a consistent 6% cashback on every purchase. At 00:00 UTC daily, the program resets, offering participants fresh opportunities to maximize their rewards and profitability daily. Crypto enthusiasts are rushing to take advantage of this program while it lasts, praising the convenience of instant USDT rewards deposited directly into their USDT (BEP-20) wallets. The straightforward structure makes it easy for participants to earn while amplifying potential returns from the BDAG presale. With the referral program serving as an additional earning channel, buyers are tapping into its benefits alongside BlockDAG’s remarkable growth. The massive scale of BlockDAG’s presale reflects its surging appeal. Having raised over $174 million—with the BDAG coin value skyrocketing by 2240% from $0.001 in the initial presale batch to $0.0234 in the ongoing batch 26—BDAG has captured the attention of the crypto community. Over 17.6 billion coins have already been sold, making the referral program an ideal entry point for those looking to join this momentum. As one of the top crypto coins, BDAG offers immediate rewards and promising long-term value, solidifying its place as a compelling choice in the market. The Bottom Line Recent Chainlink news highlights the platform’s push to enhance DeFi protocols through Smart Value Recapture (SVR), strengthening its functionality and appeal. The latest Shiba Inu update introduces “SHIB: The Metaverse,” showcasing the token’s growth into a dynamic ecosystem. BlockDAG, however, sets itself apart with its referral program, which offers instant USDT rewards of up to 10% for referrers and consistent 6% cashback for buyers on every transaction. With its growing $174M presale success and a referral system creating buzz, BlockDAG offers a rare chance to earn instant USDT now while joining a presale giant that’s on its way to becoming the top crypto coin in the market.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI.

He predicted it could crash to as low as $78,000 and explained why he holds such a bearish sentiment. Peter Brandt Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash To $78,000 In an X post, Peter Brandt predicted that the Bitcoin price could crash to $78,000. This prediction came as he revealed a head and shoulders top pattern. The legendary analyst remarked that a complete formation of this pattern could cause a price breakdown to this target. Brandt added that this pattern might fail with a “thrust hire,” or it might morph into something else. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Fibonacci And Elliott Wave Analysis Suggests $15 By May 2025 Peter Brandt stated that as it stands now, it is a head and shoulders top pattern for the Bitcoin price dealt with for what it is. The legendary analyst isn’t the only one who has raised this bearish pattern for Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Aksel Kibar also highlighted a potential head and shoulders pattern that formed on the BTC chart. The analyst indicated that this bearish pattern put the Bitcoin price at risk of dropping to $80,000. He also raised the possibility of this pullback pushing the flagship crypto to the broadening pattern that completed with a breakout above $73,600. However, the analyst suggested that this bearish pattern can still be invalidated as it still needs to breach below the neckline before this breakdown becomes a real possibility. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also recently provided a bearish setup for the Bitcoin price. He stated that a drop below $93,600 could send the flagship crypto to $80,000 or even $70,000. On the other hand, he remarked that BTC needs to break above $94,800 to confirm a price rebound. How It Could Play Out For BTC In an X post, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto provided insights into how it could play out for the Bitcoin price. He stated that Bitcoin might experience a dump before heading to Q1 2025 before the final rally to a cycle top. He added that 2025 will be more volatile than most market participants expect. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gets Caught In Long Cup And Handle Pattern That Could Send Price Crashing Below $0.2 The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could rally to a cycle top of around $130,000.

Despite Bitcoin’s current tepid price action, the analyst is confident that the crypto will still rally much higher. He stated that everything points to the Bitcoin price being higher a few months from now. The crypto analyst added that it doesn’t matter whether BTC drops to $87,000 in the meantime or not, as it will still rally higher later on.

38320727,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-etf-filing-futures,1735594200,Solana gets a leveraged ETF filing for non-existent futures,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . A curious filing landed on the SEC’s database Friday. Volatility Shares filed for a Solana futures ETF, which would issue securities that track the price movements of underlying SOL futures contracts trading on a CFTC-registered exchange. There’s a catch though: No such SOL futures contracts exist. ETF analysts nevertheless said the filing bodes well for spot Solana ETFs’ chances of being approved sometime in 2025. “Many believe that with Paul Atkins as SEC chair , a wider range of products will be possible. This filing appears to be a bet on that,” Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said in a direct message. Volatility Shares is a leveraged ETF specialist based in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. The smallish firm has arguably still helped shift the overton window for regulators: Grayscale argued in 2023 that Volatility Shares’ leveraged bitcoin futures ETF was riskier than Grayscale’s proposed spot bitcoin ETF, so Grayscale’s product should be approved. Now, Volatility Shares is offering another nonconsensus product in a Solana ETF space that is currently built on making bets. Its Solana futures ETF would give some investors exposure to 2x or the inverse of the daily price change of SOL futures. SOL futures contracts don’t currently trade (bitcoin and ether both have futures trading on the CME), but Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said the filing is probably a good sign that SOL futures are “on the way.” Regulators could be more likely to approve spot ETFs if they see “a healthy market that’s liquid enough for SOL to trade,” Sol Strategies CEO Leah Wald said, noting that bitcoin and ether ETFs were only approved by the SEC after CME futures began trading. Conventional wisdom used to hold that futures were a needed prerequisite for crypto ETFs, but that math seemingly changed with the possibility that a Trump electoral victory would end Gary Gensler’s tenure as SEC chair. At least five firms have already filed for spot SOL ETFs over the past six months despite the lack of futures. Still, a futures market likely wouldn’t hurt the spot SOL ETFs’ approval odds. “Alright, I’ve seen enough…Registering formal prediction,” Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, wrote on X. “Spot solana ETFs will be approved in 2025.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

38320326,https://crypto.news/?p=14323409,1735593948,How to mine Litecoin: Everything you need to get started,"Litecoin is an early-stage altcoin developed by a former Google Engineer, Charlie Lee in October 2011. Lee wanted to create a cryptocurrency faster than Bitcoin and easily accessible, with the aim to process a block in every two and a half minutes compared to ten minutes of bitcoin. So, let’s look at how to mine Litecoin. Table of Contents What is Litecoin mining and how does it work? Requirements to start mining Litecoin Step-by-step guide to mine Litecoin Litecoin mining profitability FAQs What is Litecoin mining and how does it work? Mining Litecoin ( LTC ) is what keeps everything in check. Think of miners as the guardians of the system, using their computers to solve puzzles that confirm and record transactions. Their reward? Brand-new Litecoin, straight from the network. To improve their chances of earning rewards, many miners team up in mining pools, sharing the load and the rewards. You might also like: New cryptocurrency to mine for free: Top 10 projects Litecoin’s Scrypt algorithm is one of its standout features, crafted to make mining easier for newcomers. Beyond accessibility, it gives Litecoin a performance boost, allowing transactions to process faster than Bitcoin’s SHA-256 approach. Initially, mining Litecoin didn’t require fancy equipment — just your regular computer. But as technology evolved, ASIC miners became the go-to hardware for efficient mining. Scrypt relies on memory, storing data in RAM to solve puzzles. This setup was meant to keep mining fair, though modern hardware has largely tipped the scales toward those with specialized machines. Requirements to start mining Litecoin To mine Litecoin, you’ll need more than just a regular computer. These days, you’ll need an ASIC miner, which is made specifically for Litecoin’s Scrypt algorithm. It’s way more powerful than a typical PC, so it’s a must for serious mining. You’ll also need mining software to link your miner to the network. Since mining on your own can be a long shot, many miners join pools to combine their resources and increase their chances of getting rewards. Just remember — mining uses quite a bit of electricity, so make sure your power costs are manageable. If you’ve got everything you need to mine LTC, let’s take a look at how to get started. Step-by-step guide to mine Litecoin How to mine Litecoin? Getting into Litecoin mining is pretty cool, but there’s a catch: it takes a bit of preparation. Here’s a simple, step-by-step guide to get you started: Choose a Litecoin mining pool . Popular mining pools like LitecoinPool.org or F2Pool are great choices because they let you team up with other miners, boosting your chances of earning rewards. Download mining software. After joining a mining pool, the next step is to get your hands on some mining software that’s compatible with your setup, like CGMiner or BFGMiner. It’s pretty simple — just download the software, install it on your computer, and you’ll be ready to start mining in no time. Configure the software. Open the mining software and configure it with your pool’s details (server address and port) and your Litecoin wallet address, where your rewards will be sent. Start to mine Litecoin . Launch the mining software to begin solving cryptographic puzzles. Your miner will start working to verify transactions and secure the Litecoin network. Monitor performance. Keep track of your miner’s progress and electricity usage to ensure everything is running efficiently and you’re getting rewards. Litecoin mining profitability LTC mining profitability isn’t fixed — it can change based on a few things like the price of Litecoin, the type of mining hardware you’re using, your electricity rates, and even the mining pool you join. Generally, more efficient hardware and lower electricity costs mean more potential for profit. But keep in mind, the crypto market can be unpredictable, so your earnings might fluctuate over time. Mining pools also impact profitability since they allow you to combine resources with others, making it easier to earn consistent rewards. It’s important to keep track of your mining performance and regularly calculate whether your setup is still profitable. Remember, mining requires ongoing investment in hardware, electricity, and sometimes cooling solutions, so always assess if your current setup is worth the effort. You might also like: Litecoin gains pushes 80% of LTC holders into profit FAQs How long does it take to mine 1 Litecoin? The time to mine LTC mostly comes down to the power of your mining equipment, the pool you’re using, and how hard the network is to mine right now. With today’s ASIC miners, it can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Just remember, the mining difficulty changes, so it’s never quite the same. How much Litecoin is left to mine? The total supply of Litecoin is capped at 84 million coins.As of December 2024, around 75.4 million LTC have already been mined, leaving about 8.6 million still to be mined. However, with decreasing block rewards over time (due to halvings), it will take decades to mine the remaining coins. What are the risks of mining Litecoin? Mining Litecoin sounds exciting, but it’s not without its risks. The biggest one is how much electricity you’ll use, which can lead to some serious bills. Plus, your mining gear can wear out over time, and the crypto market can be unpredictable — prices can drop when you least expect it. Oh, and don’t forget, mining pools can take a cut, meaning your profits might not be as high as you hope.",NEUTRAL,LTC,BTC | LTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/how-to-mine-litecoin/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/38320326.jpeg

38320773,https://thecoinrise.com/moonpay-gets-approved-under-europes-mica-law/,1735593522,MoonPay Gets Approved Under Europe’s MiCA Law,"Crypto payment platform MoonPay announced that it has received approval under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. Noteworthy, MiCA offers a unified legal framework across the European Economic Area (EEA). Its aim is to combat illicit activities like money laundering while it improves consumer protection, transparency, and market stability. MoonPay Receives Approval to Legalise Offerings With this MiCA license , MoonPay has proven to be compliant with these rigorous standards. It has also positioned itself for expansion of its services in the European crypto ecosystem. Also, it would also be able to lead innovation in the same region. Users can continue to interact with the exchange’s fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat payment services across Europe. Ivan Soto-Wright, MoonPay’s CEO and co-founder, noted that the “approval underscores MoonPay’s commitment to regulatory excellence and our mission to build a trusted bridge between traditional finance and the crypto economy.” EU MiCA Finally Comes Into Effect It is worth noting that MiCA legislation took full effect today. The comprehensive regulatory framework requires that all stablecoins be issued by entities with an e-money license. Additionally, stablecoin issuers like Circle and Tether, need to hold reserves in independent banks and track transactions. While Circle has aligned itself to fulfil the requirements of the rule, Tether is still undecided. The largest stablecoin issuer is concerned about the impact that the crypto regulation will have on USD-pegged stablecoins. Similarly, the broader crypto ecosystem is constantly discussing how the MiCA rule will affect the market, especially with President-elect Donald Trump’s potential crypto-friendly policies in the United States. Many entities in the crypto industry think that the introduction of MiCA could leave the market at risk . MoonPay in Talks to Acquire Helio Pay Amidst these exciting times, reports have it that MoonPay is negotiating a $150 million acquisition of prominent crypto e-commerce platform Helio Pay. Should this pull through, this deal would become MoonPay’s most significant acquisition since inception. Hence, it signals a strategic push into the growing e-commerce sector. Moreso, the acquisition could boost the firm’s offerings by integrating its self-service platform, which supports over 6,000 merchants and content creators. Helio Pay already accepts Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins, such as USD Coin (USDC), as a payment option.

The process is expected to go more smoothly after the council review and consensus phase. Community members are encouraged to participate in a survey to determine which of the three proposed options will guide the protocol’s improvement strategy. Current focus includes: Addressing Lost Deposits: Recapitalizing the protocol to enable modest refunds and establish a foundation for long-term recovery. Attracting Partnerships: Partnerships aim to secure new capital and recovery resources to enhance the recovery process. Comprehensive Revitalization Plan: Developing a framework for recapitalization and recovery that can improve the protocol’s prospects and attract future investments. Radiant Capital has announced plans to elect a new community council as outlined in the DAO bylaws. This proposal is currently in the community collaboration phase and will soon enter the governance process. The new council will replace the inaugural council, with elections planned to be held annually going forward. In October 2024, Radiant Capital suffered its second attack of the year. The first incident involved a flashloan attack in which the attackers withdrew approximately $4.5 million from the protocol.

38322421,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323442,1735592509,Massive $1 Billion Floods Into Pepe – Is This the Start of a Meme Coin Comeback?,"PEPE is making a comeback, with its price rallying from its recent bottom following a massive $1 billion volume inflow. In this article, we explore the latest PEPE price trends to better understand where prices may be heading next. According to CoinCodex data , PEPE is currently the #28 cryptocurrency and the #3 meme coin and is up +1.6% week-on-week amid substantial inflows of $1,628,670,111 in 24-hour trading volume. PEPE Price Analysis: Will PEPE Crypto Fall Victim To Rising Wedge? As PEPE price remains in a rising wedge pattern, PEPE is currently trading at a market price of $0.0000176 (representing a 24-hour change of -1.4%). This comes after yesterday’s inflow of more than $1Bn in trading volume, which saw price action surge to the upside in an attempted break above local resistance at $0.00001942. Yet, meeting resistance swiftly—with a lower daily high —could spark some concern amongst holders, with fears that the PEPE price is forming a bearish rising wedge pattern. The rising wedge appears bearish due to the narrowing of the trendlines, which spotlights weakening bullish momentum despite the sustained consolidation and attempts at higher highs over the past week. All eyes are now on the descendant 20DMA (sat at $0.00002020) to see whether its arrival at the current consolidation zone will force a downside reversal or enable PEPE bulls to reclaim crucial moving average support. Contrary to the worrying technical pattern, a slither of hope emerges in the RSI, which has managed to cool off to bullish divergence amid the consolidation move – now reading at 48 – this could soon suggest an upside breakout is on the cards. Overall, given the ongoing consolidation range, short-time price action appears rather predictable, especially as a potential display of HTF double-bottomed support reinforces the idea of an upside move in a continuation of the current range. This leaves PEPE with an upside target at $0.000019 (a potential +7.85%) and a downside risk at $0.00001728 (a possible -2.37%), and a consequent short-time frame risk: reward of 3.31 – a likely good swing trade. Wolf of Wall Street Crypto Rocks PEPE Market With Viral Presale But while PEPE’s growth from here is limited by its huge market capitalization, a new PEPE coin is shaking up the space with Jordan Belfort’s stylistic flair – and retail investors are entering a frenzy to stack the new project ahead of its highly anticipated launch. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) exploded onto the scene this December with an astronomical presale skyrocketing out of the bull market to hit a present $38.23M raised in just weeks. Presale’s flowing. Candles are growing. $WEPE ain’t slowing. pic.twitter.com/vqHonzkn1v — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 30, 2024 With $40M firmly in the presales crosshairs, many are labeling it the next Pepe Unchained, which raised more than $75M in presale across Q3/Q4 and blasted off at DEX launch with a near-instant 300% gain in the market. Analysts believe Wall Street Pepe could smash this performance, having already rapidly amassed more than half the funds raised by Pepe Unchained – in just 10% of the time. This spotlights the huge market appetite for the Wolf of Wall Street Pepe. It’s easy to see why when you discover that the $WEPE token is your exclusive ticket to join a community call group intent on smacking back at the manipulation of insider whale groups through the power of grassroots mass action – just like the legendary Wall Street Bets.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 524,500 followers on the social media platform X that BTC shattered two support levels on the weekly chart, suggesting that its short-term uptrend has come to an end. According to the analyst, the price action indicates that BTC could take a breather in the coming weeks. “The weekly support has been lost. The five-week technical uptrend is over (orange). Bitcoin is showing increasing signs of transitioning into a multi-week correction. Any relief rally, if at all needed, into these old supports could turn them into new resistance to confirm additional downside continuation.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt also highlights that Bitcoin is flipping previous supports into resistance levels, lending more credence to his bearish BTC stance. The trader now sees Bitcoin hitting the $90,000 price level. “Old supports are acting as new resistance. As a result, technically, the breakdown has been confirmed. But the follow-through in bearish downside continuation ever since has been relatively limited thus far. $94,250 on the daily would need to be lost for the price to drop into the low $90,000s.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $93,487.

38319804,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635163,1735592435,Hyperliquid (HYPE) was the highest FDV project to launch in 2024,"Hyperliquid is the last major project to launch in 2024, while also having the highest fully diluted valuation. Hyperliquid (HYPE) is valued at a notional $27.2B, surpassing other startups with high-profile launches. Hyperliquid (HYPE) turned out to be the biggest launch for 2024, taking the top spot with a fully diluted value of $27.2B. The HYPE token appreciated rapidly after the airdrop, while the perpetual futures DEX increased its listings and volumes. Hyperliquid’s launch arrived in November, after months of sparking expectations with airdrop farming. The HYPE token launched during a period of heightened market activity and near-peak prices. Even with questions raised on the sustainability of Hyperliquid, the airdrop achieved an unexpectedly high valuation, as it did not sink after the token launch. For Hyperliquid, becoming a top airdrop for 2025 was a major success, as the project started with extremely low expected valuations. HYPE airdrop value has been calculated at FDV as low as $150M, surprising the recipients of the airdrop. HYPE still traded at $27.34 toward the end of the year, after peaking above $32. HYPE gets support from token burns and from the highly active protocol fees, which accrue during periods of market volatility. In 2024, despite the meme trend of launching tokens and growing their valuation, large VC-backed projects remained one of the strong trends. Those projects had a much higher fully diluted value, raising expectations of demanding sufficient demand to keep their token from sinking. Based on CryptoDiffer data, 2024 had one significant project each month, with a minimum value of $1.27B for Drift Protocol. High-FDV projects propose long-term vesting schedules Despite this, the new batch of high-FDV projects was greeted as new opportunities, to which a more liquid market could adapt. To avoid pressure on the token price, Hyperliquid keeps $6.44B in value locked, based on the share of core contributors . Unlocks for early contributors and investors will start in November 2025, giving enough time for HYPE to establish its range. HYPE was just 31% unlocked as of December 30, while some of the unlocked tokens were vested again. The recovery of DeFi brought in Ethena (ENA), a project that benefitted from the 2024 market. Ethena traded at a valuation of $2.8B at the end of 2024, though with FDV of $14.3B. For Ethena, token unlocks will start in April 2025 for early investors and other special interest groups. The unlocks will happen almost monthly, and dilute the market cap by 5.38% a month. The third-largest project was Ondo Finance, with an FDV of $13.4B and a market capitalization of just $1.95B for its tokens in circulation. Ondo Finance is preparing for one of its largest unlocks on January 18, 2024, which will dilute the currently circulating tokens by 134%. The unlocking event will free up 19.4% of the total supply, leaving the market to absorb up to $2.9B in tokens, if the holders try to sell. Those three most ambitious projects all depended on an ongoing bull market to retain growth. Ondo Finance rode the trend of RWA asset tokenization, aiming to offer institutional-grade products on-chain. Ethena depended on the bullish trend for Ethereum (ETH) to make its fees and distribute them as earnings to the holders of its synthetic stablecoin. For all three of the top projects for 2024, the current value locked is much lower compared to their FDV. Hyperliquid locked in $2.55B in its bridges, a small fraction of the value locked in its tokens. Ethena had a value locked of $5.95B based on its issuance of USDE stablecoins, while Ondo Finance only carried $612.53B TVL. The new batch of projects from 2024 remains closely watched, even as older low-float tokens are still putting new tokens into the market. In the last week of 2024, another $421M in tokens was unlocked, still diluting the supply of top tokens like SUI and Optimism (OP).

38319943,https://blockworks.co/news/crypto-etf-filings-2024,1735592400,Crypto ETF filers hard at work for the holidays,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Fund issuers continue to dream up crypto ETFs they hope to launch in 2025. We recently highlighted Bitwise’s filing for a Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF to invest in those with at least 1,000 BTC. Related, Strive Asset Management filed last Thursday for a Bitcoin Bond ETF that would seek exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy and others expected to use a big portion of proceeds to buy BTC. REX Advisers then shared plans to launch a Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF that (you guessed it) would invest in convertible bonds issued by companies holding the largest crypto asset. ProShares also plotted three bitcoin-related funds. A so-called S&P 500 Bitcoin ETF would take a long position in S&P 500 stocks and a short US dollar/long bitcoin position. The latter piece is done via bitcoin futures as a way “to currency hedge the US dollar exposure of the S&P 500 stocks position,” a company filing notes. Two other planned products similarly aim to replicate the performance of bitcoin-denominated investments in Nasdaq 100 stocks and gold. ProShares files for S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, & gold ETFs denominated in btc… Basically a long position in underlying stocks or gold & then a short usd/long btc position using btc futures. I’m calling these btc hedged ETFs. Bitcoin is starting to eat tradfi. pic.twitter.com/6gsThIWvFT — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 28, 2024 Perhaps more interestingly, Volatility Shares filed for an ETF that would invest in solana futures contracts “that trade only on an exchange registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.” These do not yet exist. The company did not immediately return my request for comment. Volatility Shares, which offers leveraged BTC and ETH futures ETFs, is also the firm that revived the effort to launch ether futures funds in mid-2023. Though it ditched those plans when many others followed suit by re-filing for similar products, some credited the firm as being crucial to achieving approval of those (and ultimately spot ETH ) products. Several firms — VanEck , 21Shares , Canary Capital , Bitwise and Grayscale — have active filings for spot solana ETFs. It remains uncertain whether the SEC will deviate from its precedent of requiring a regulated futures market — such as those available for BTC and ETH but not for solana — before approving other spot crypto funds. One thing’s for sure (as stated on X by Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas): “Damn. ETF issuers don’t sleep (or take the week [between] xmas and new years off).”It’s probably a sign there’s plenty more filings to come in the new year.

38319494,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314630,1735592155,"Here’s How Bitcoin Could Potentially Witness a Price Pump, According to Glassnode Co-Founders","The co-founders of the blockchain analysis platform Glassnode are laying out how Bitcoin ( BTC ) can reclaim six figures and more. Glassnode and Swissblock co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Alleman, who share the social media handle Negentropic, start by comparing BTC’s current situation to a similar scenario from a few years back. “Let’s look at the period from December 2020 to February 2021, which corresponds to a similar cycle phase and comparable price action. At that time, the outflow of liquidity coincided with a price correction, but network growth persisted. Likewise, when the price stabilized and a new influx of liquidity began, the price rebounded strongly.” According to Negentropic, liquidity could be the deciding factor in a Bitcoin price pump. “This suggests that we could potentially see a price pump once liquidity flows back into the market and the price does not drop to lower levels as long as network growth remains at bullish levels.” Source: Negentropic/X In an accompanying Swissblock post, the market intelligence firm suggests that profit-taking must calm down before BTC can rise again. “Profit-taking above $90,000 and near $100,000 has persisted among market participants (no surprise, as long-term holders continue to take profits). However, this selling pressure is gradually losing intensity. For price momentum to resume within the bullish territory, profit-taking must stabilize, and we need to avoid large volumes of selling that create spikes on the chart.” BTC is trading for $92,077 at time of writing, down 1.7% on the day.

38319350,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99542,1735591460,Pundit Calls PEPE “Extremely Explosive” Amid Record Holder Metrics,"PEPE , the third-largest meme coin after SHIB and DOGE has been generating considerable buzz recently as analysts predict it could soon experience a significant price surge. CryptoZeus, a well-known analyst within the meme coin community, has raised expectations for PEPE’s future, describing the token as “extremely explosive.” In a recent YouTube video , CryptoZeus highlighted PEPE’s resilience amidst market fluctuations, noting that the coin’s price consolidation suggests it could be on the cusp of another breakout. “PEPE could potentially be on the drive for another explosive breakout coming up soon,” he said, referencing a triangle consolidation pattern since December 9. He further predicted that if this breakout materializes, PEPE could reach 0.0000314 USD, with the possibility of the coin eliminating up to four zeros from its price, setting a new all-time high for the token. He also underscored the critical role of community support and retail adoption in the success of meme coins like PEPE. The token is already gaining significant traction, particularly among large retail holders, with over 92,000 investors contributing substantial amounts. Additionally, PEPE’s community continues to grow rapidly, with more than 355,300 holders and approximately 1,000 new holders joining daily. In addition to these positive developments, recent whale activity has further fueled speculation about PEPE’s potential. Recently, one of the largest whales, which had not traded for over 600 days, moved 2.1 trillion PEPE tokens worth $52 million. Such activity suggests a surge in interest from large investors , further fueling expectations of a significant price rally for PEPE. This has led many to draw comparisons between PEPE and other meme coin success stories like DOGE and SHIB, which saw explosive growth in previous bull markets. Predictions from CoinCodex also suggest that PEPE could reach $0.000152 by 2029, representing a 600% increase. Other forecasts also indicate significant growth in the next two to five years, with many analysts believing that PEPE is on the cusp of a parabolic price movement. The broader market environment also adds to the optimism. Bitcoin’s recent price rally has historically led altcoins, including meme coins, to follow suit, often resulting in impressive performances. According to CryptoZeus, this ongoing bull run could continue attracting institutional money into Bitcoin and blue-chip coins like PEPE, providing a significant boost in price. “In a bull market, the money flows into blue-chip cryptos. While low-cap coins can offer quick profits, blue chips like Bitcoin and PEPE generally outperform as institutional money pours in.” He added. PEPE was trading at roughly $0.000019 at press time, reflecting an 11.81% drop in the past 24 hours. However, the coin’s trading volume surged by 60% during the same period, reaching $3.45 billion. Additionally, PEPE’s market cap climbed from the 25th to the 23rd, underscoring its growing momentum despite the price decline.",POSITIVE,PEPE,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | PEPE,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/pundit-calls-pepe-extremely-explosive-amid-record-holder-metrics/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
38319268,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323395,1735591328,Fox Host Calls Out XRP Supporters – Massive Backlash Erupts Online,"Fox News business reporter Charles Gasparino became the subject of a controversial rift with the community that backs the popular crypto project Ripple (XRP) after claiming that there is no “XRP army” as these enthusiasts typically refer to themselves. Just a few days after he criticized Judge’s Analisa Torres ruling earlier this month, which put to an end a high-profile legal case between the company and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gasparino is now slamming the project’s founders and their motives. There is no ""XRP Army."" But there are a bunch of dudes who bought the coin that made insiders rich and they've been waiting for their pay day ever since. See creepy Jimmy–it aint fun stalking me. Sad Ha! https://t.co/B7mz83F4ax — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) December 29, 2024 In response to a comment from James Rule, a notable supporter and Ripple (XRP) investor, he highlighted that this so-called “army” is just a group of people who have made the developing team rich. He is referring to Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse, David Schwartz, and Stuart Alderoty, who are the most prominent public figures and leaders of the blockchain company and whose net worth is estimated to be in the billions of dollars. The news anchor’s rift with the XRP community started a couple of days ago when he called the Judge’s ruling on the XRP v. SEC case “idiotic”. During an interview with Anthony Pompliano, he claimed that the judge’s distinction between retail and institutional investors and her stance on diminished disclosures established a dangerous precedent. Gasparino’s comments rapidly drawn severe backlash from XRP supporters, some of which called him a “manipulated parrot” while others asked him to “stay on his lane” referring to his lack of understanding about the crypto space. Shortly after the ruling, the price of XRP was propelled as investors saw it as a major victory for the blockchain company. With the additional help of the post-election tailwind, the token accumulates gains of 234% since the year started and have made it the fourth most valuable cryptocurrency with a market cap of $117.87 billion as of today. XRP Keeps Dropping and Comes Closer to Critical Support Area The price of XRP has been steadily dropping lately as early buyers may have decided to take some of the profits they brought in November. After reaching an all-time high of $2.90 on December 3, the token has retreated by 30% and it is currently approaching a critical support area at $1.95. This level has served as a bouncing pad in two occasions already, confirming its importance to market participants. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in a clear downward path, meaning that momentum is in favor of bears while trading volumes have subsided lately and are currently well below the levels seen in mid-to-late November. Moving forward, traders will be taking a close look at what happens once the price reaches the $1.95 threshold as a drop below could result in further weakness for XRP in the near term. Meanwhile, a strong bounce above this area could push the token to the $3 level shortly and even higher if there’s enough interest to push the price above the $3.5 mark. Less Than 24 Hours Left to Buy This Promising Meme Coin During its Presale A new meme coin is about to launch and investors are betting that it will be a sensation. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has attracted over $38 million from early buyers in just a few weeks as its presale is coming off the heels of the successful listing of Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) . With just 15 hours left until the next price increase, time is running out to jump in at the current price. Ritual complete. Green candles lighting the way. pic.twitter.com/9lZZr4diqN — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 29, 2024 The $WEPE token is currently available at a discounted price of $0.0003661 that offers both limited downside and ample runway for 10x or even 100x gains once the token is listed on exchanges. Pepe-the-Frog-themed tokens have been quite popular among meme coin investors and the success of $PEPU, which produced gains of over 300% shortly after it was listed, shows that there’s still significant untapped potential on tokens that feature this character. The most powerful feature that can make $WEPE even more successful than its predecessor is an eager desire to build a community of investors who want to stand up against the dominance that deep-pocketed groups have exert on certain digital assets. The WEPE army has come to challenge the status quo by introducing a community-centered token that will take on whales to produce life-changing wealth for those who get in early. There’s still a bit of time to buy $WEPE at this heavily discounted price. Visit the Wall Street Pepe website and connect your wallet to invest in this presale while it is still running. You can either convert ETH or USDT tokens into $WEPE or use a bank card. No time to waste, the WEPE army is closing ranks and you don’t want to miss this chance.

38320541,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53466,1735590989,Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Spots This Bullish Signal On XRP Price Chart,"Renowned trader Peter Brandt recently shared a bullish outlook for XRP in a post on X, citing technical patterns on the asset’s weekly chart. He pointed to the emergence of a bullish wedge, which, if confirmed, could signal significant price appreciation extending into 2025. However, this longer-term view, contrasts with short-term signals from XRP’s daily chart, which indicates a possible pullback from its local high of $2.728. Here are two views of $XRPUSD a weekly chart and a daily chart Strong opinions, weakly held A chart is not an opinion and an opinion is not necessarily a position – this is a concept hard to understand by rookies pic.twitter.com/SvaT5hojLW — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 27, 2024 Brandt has also noted the formation of a Half Mast Flag pattern on the XRP/USD chart . “If this pattern completes,” he stated, “the distance to upside should equal advance into tip of flag.” While this technical setup often predicts a continuation of prior gains, it is not a guaranteed indicator of sustained upward momentum. Assessing the December Rally and Its Aftermath XRP experienced a substantial surge in December, peaking at $2.72 on December 3. This marked one of the asset’s highest points since its 2018 all-time high. However, the rally lost steam, and XRP has since been on a gradual decline. Market volatility intensified during the holiday period, further hindering price recovery efforts. The introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin briefly reignited investor interest, leading to a minor uptick in price. However, the rally was insufficient to push XRP toward new highs, leaving the asset 36% below its peak valuation recorded nearly six years ago. As of now, XRP is trading at approximately $2.14, reflecting a period of stagnation as it struggles to regain upward momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Market Metrics and Investor Sentiment Despite the recent correction, XRP’s market fundamentals continue to demonstrate resilience. The asset’s market capitalization has reached $125.48 billion, suggesting a stable base of investor confidence. Meanwhile, its 24-hour trading volume has climbed by 5% to $5.42 billion, resulting in a volume-to-market cap ratio of 4.41%. This indicates consistent liquidity levels within the market. In addition, XRP’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) now stands at $214.25 billion. This metric highlights the asset’s strong long-term potential, underscoring its enduring appeal among both retail and institutional investors. While XRP has yet to reclaim its former glory, its robust market metrics and technical signals offer hope for recovery in the months ahead. Whether 2024 will bring a renewed rally or further consolidation remains to be seen. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

38319888,https://invezz.com/?p=2411392,1735590794,"Crypto’s identity crisis: Fed’s Daly says it’s no gold, needs its own definition","The debate surrounding the true nature of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, with San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly weighing in on the matter. In a recent interview, Daly argued that crypto should be considered its own distinct asset class, rather than being grouped alongside gold as is often the case. Defining crypto: more than just a commodity “I see crypto as a complicated thing, and the service we need to do for everyone is really unpack what we mean and call it what it is once we’ve done that,” Daly stated on Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast. She emphasized that crypto could serve multiple roles—a currency, a medium of exchange, or an asset that can appreciate or depreciate in value—and that these terms require clear definition. “So I don’t think of it as like gold,” Daly added. It has properties like gold sometimes, but I don’t think of it like that. Contrasting views within the Fed Daly’s perspective presents a slight departure from the views of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who earlier this month energized the crypto community with his comments on bitcoin. Powell described bitcoin as a “speculative asset,” comparing it to virtual or digital gold. “People are not using it as a form of payment or as a store of value,” Powell said at the New York Times DealBook conference. It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar; it’s really a competitor for gold. The road to currency status Echoing Powell’s sentiment, Daly stressed that crypto is not yet ready to function as a currency, despite the aspirations of many crypto enthusiasts. “The property it needs is that it has to grow as the economy grows,” Daly explained. So its value doesn’t change just because people want it. So when more people want a dollar bill, the dollar bill doesn’t rise in value. What causes the dollar to fluctuate is the economy and how fast our growth is relative to other countries. So that is a property it will have to perfect for it to be a currency. Crypto’s market momentum despite regulatory uncertainty While the path to official recognition as a currency by Congress remains uncertain, the momentum behind various digital assets continues to build. Bitcoin has seen significant gains since Donald Trump’s election on November 5, breaking through the $100,000 mark for the first time on December 4. Bitcoin prices have risen 38% since Election Day and are 106% higher this year. Crypto-linked stocks like Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) have also seen impressive growth. Institutional adoption and the Trump factor The warming sentiment towards crypto is also reflected in recent investments from institutional players that typically favor traditional assets. In May, Wisconsin’s pension fund purchased over $160 million in bitcoin shares, signaling growing acceptance from traditional financial players. Furthermore, MicroStrategy (MSTR), led by Michael Saylor, has continued its aggressive acquisition of bitcoin. The new Trump administration’s appointment of venture capitalist David Sacks as a crypto czar may pave the way for new initiatives, including a potential bitcoin reserve. “Just the fact that there would even be someone who would be focused on making the United States a leader in crypto, bitcoin mining, and other areas President Trump has talked about is a sea change,” Benchmark Company analyst Mark Palmer said on Opening Bid. “We assume in our analysis [that] the price of bitcoin will reach $225,000 by the end of 2026.” He also emphasized that “The fact that we are seeing increased institutional adoption of bitcoin is key here.” The post Crypto's identity crisis: Fed's Daly says it's no gold, needs its own definition appeared first on Invezz",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2024/12/30/cryptos-identity-crisis-feds-daly-says-its-no-gold-needs-its-own-definition/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png
38319266,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323373,1735590725,Hyperliquid Airdrop Crashes 23% – Is There Hidden Bullish Signal?,"Since December 21, when its price reached an all-time high of $34.96 per coin, the price of Hyperliquid’s native token $HYPE has retreated by 23% as the market’s sentiment has changed slightly since the last meeting of the Federal Reserve. However, this has not made the $HYPE airdrop any less successful as the token accumulates gains of nearly 275% since it hit the secondary market according to data from CoinMarketCap. Despite its temporary weakness, high-profile crypto analysts are enthusiastic about what the future holds for HYPE. This includes Ansem, a popular figure on X who is known for his early bets on Solana (SOL) and dogwifhat (WIF) that allowed him to reap millions. In a recent tweet, he compared $HYPE’s prospects with that of $SOL back when the token was worth only $8 in a tongue-in-cheek way. I missed SOL $8 to $200 I won't miss HYPE to $300 — Ansem (@blknoiz06) December 16, 2024 Although he has not provided many details about his bullish stance on this new token, this protocol is already making its way to the headlines amid its appealing value proposition and tokenomics. Hyperliquid is a perpetuals exchange that operates in its own layer-one (L1) network . Multiple tokens can be traded within its platform through a user-friendly interface at competitive trading fees. The $HYPE token has been designed as a deflationary asset as its total supply shrinks every year. This is achieved by progressively burning tokens with the income generated by trading fees. As a result, the value of the $HYPE token is poised to increase over time as long as the exchange is being used widely. Data from DeFiLlama indicates that the total value locked (TVL) of Hyperliquid currently stands at $2.3 billion making it the 19 th largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol in the crypto space at the moment. Although Hyperliquid still has much to prove in terms of adoption and growth, the protocol has already proven that it can attract significant interest from investors who see significant price appreciation ahead for its native token $HYPE. $Hype Breaks Trend Line Support but Resumes Upward Trajectory $HYPE moved up at a frantic pace shortly after its airdrop. However, the token faced a significant pullback since December 21 that slowed down its pace and pushed it below the $25 area temporarily. The token found support shortly after at $24 and has been progressively making higher lows and higher highs since then, meaning that a new uptrend is forming. Although the former trajectory is no longer dominating the price action, $HYPE is still moving up. The road to retest its all-time highs may not be as smooth as before but as long as the price holds above $20 the outlook for the token is positive. Ansem’s comments may have aided $HYPE’s short-term performance as he is a widely followed voice in the crypto space, boasting nearly 633,000 followers on the social media platform X. Whether the market’s excitement for this protocol and its native token continues will depend on adoption, TVL growth, the rate at which $HYPE is burned by the project’s treasury, and other similar factors. This Vote-to-Earn (V2E) Token Has Raised Millions in Just a Few Days The pioneer meme coin of the vote-to-earn (V2E), Flockerz , has been attracting significant interest for investors every week amid its innovative model that compensates token holders for participating in the project’s governance decisions. Thus far, the $FLOCK presale has raised $8.25 million in less than 14 days as investors have opted to take advantage of the discounted price at which the token is being offered. The Flock Don't Stop! With just 25 days left in the presale, The Flock continues to show its strength, with 8M raised! What a proud day for all of Flocktopia pic.twitter.com/GA7JDEt4YX — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 27, 2024 Flockerz introduces a novel mechanism that incentivizes holders to vote and have a say on how the project advances toward its goals. Vote-to-earn (V2E) has emerged to become a widely adopted approach that meme coins may be embraced in the near future to build stronger and more engaged communities. With $FLOCK, investors earn from multiple sides. They can generate staking rewards with a generous APY, they will benefit from receiving token rewards for casting votes on the protocol’s most critical proposals, and they will also gain from progressive increases in the price of the token once its presale ends and exchanges start to list it. The presale price of $FLOCK stands at $0.0065561. This is a heavily discounted price that the developing team is offering to position early buyers favorably to gain once the asset is listed on major exchanges.

38319139,https://blockworks.co/news/eoy-price-updates-and-outlook,1735590600,"(Almost) end-of-year price update, outlook","This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . There was no shortage of crypto price predictions this year, particularly (it seemed) in November and December after the election. Some had been eyeing the $125,000 level for BTC at the end of 2024, while others did warn of a pullback . Where we stood at 2:10 pm ET Monday: BTC at ~$94,300 and ETH at ~$3,400. Bitcoin has dropped roughly 12% since rising above $108,000 on Dec. 17. Ether was trading higher than the $4,000 mark that day, but has fallen 15% since. 21Shares research strategist Matt Mena attributed this in part to the more hawkish vibes from the Fed heading into 2025. The forecast of two rate cuts next year (instead of three) “dampened market sentiment and is a key factor behind the recent downturn in prices for BTC, ETH and other risk assets,” he argued. Mena also noted that the six-month high in the 10-year Treasury yield further diminishes the appeal of crypto assets, as investors shift toward safer and more predictable returns. Then there’re those who are locking in gains realized over the year, Mena said. At the same time, others are employing tax-loss harvesting strategies — selling assets that have declined in value to offset capital gains and reduce taxable income . He and other analysts have called this a “healthy” correction, typical for bitcoin after a significant run-up. If BTC can stay above $85,000, the 21Shares exec told me he thinks it will sustain the uptrend seen in recent months. Otherwise, we could see accelerated selling and further price declines. “The next major psychological price level to watch is $110,000,” Mena added. “Once bitcoin breaks through this resistance, we could see a swift surge to $120,000, with the potential to target $150,000 by the summer as momentum builds.” Sergei Gorev, head of risk at YouHodler, predicts the corrective sentiment in the crypto market to persist into 2025. He cited the historical correlation between BTC and the declining M2 money supply as a key factor. But Galaxy’s Alex Thorn wrote in a Friday research note that he expects BTC to ultimately reach 20% of gold’s market capitalization in 2025 (it’s currently slightly more than 10%). Thorn thinks BTC will cross $150,000 in the year’s first half — as well as a “test or best” of $185,000 in Q4.“A combination of institutional, corporate and nation state adoption will propel bitcoin to new heights in 2025,” the Galaxy research head wrote. “Throughout its existence, bitcoin has appreciated faster than all other asset classes, particularly the S&P 500 and gold, and that trend will continue in 2025.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

38319887,https://invezz.com/?p=2411367,1735590201,"AI16Z gains 20% as Bitcoin faces deeper correction, analysts warn","Bitcoin remained largely range-bound throughout the day, maintaining support above $93,000 before bearish pressure drove the price closer to $90,000 during the late trading hours. The border cryptocurrency market remained in a downward trajectory as bearish sentiment prevailed. The overall cryptocurrency market capitalisation dropped 4.3% in the past 24 hours to $3.36 trillion as of press time. The crypto fear and greed index dropped by 4 points to 50 from yesterday’s 54, signalling a shift towards neutral sentiment as traders adopt a more cautious stance in the face of uncertain market conditions. Why is BTC falling? Today, Bitcoin traders reacted to the looming US debt ceiling deadline as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Congress that the U.S. could hit its borrowing limit between January 14 and 23. Fears of a US default are rising because Congress has a limited window to raise or suspend the debt ceiling, and political gridlock often delays decisive action. If lawmakers fail to act in time, the US risks running out of cash to meet its financial obligations, which could trigger significant economic consequences. During such scenarios, investors tend to pull back from volatile assets, seeking safety in more stable options. Interestingly, while Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against economic instability, it has consistently underperformed in the days following debt ceiling resolutions. Bitcoin also dropped as bearish technicals appeared on its daily chart. Earlier in the day, veteran trader Peter Brandt flagged a head and shoulders top pattern on the BTC/USD chart. This is a classic reversal pattern that indicates a shift from a bullish to a bearish trend. It is usually followed by a price drop if it’s confirmed. Based on the chart, a daily close below the neckline at around $90,000 would validate the pattern. If this breakdown happens, Bitcoin could see a drop towards the $78,000 level in the coming weeks, according to the analyst. Adding to the narrative, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a lack of support below the $93,000 mark. IntoTheBlock data shows a sharp drop in buying interest in this price range, with fewer Bitcoin addresses holding BTC below this level. With Bitcoin now trading at $91,863.90, this lack of support becomes even more critical. This means that if Bitcoin fails to reclaim $93,000, there’s little structural support to prevent further downturn. Yet the long-term narrative remained bullish as many analysts reiterated that corrections are normal during bull runs, and Bitcoin has averaged 30% pullbacks during past cycles. One bullish case was offered by trader and influencer Jason A. Williams, who told his X followers that the biggest digital currency was trading in an accumulation zone, which could lay the foundation for a break out above $131,000 by Q1 2025. Fellow analyst Moustache reinforced the narrative, pointing to a bullish megaphone pattern that BTC had formed over 3.5 years and was currently retesting. Once confirmed, he added that this could push prices above six figures once again. Upon writing, BTC was down over 2% on the day, trading at $91,943. Meanwhile, losses were more pronounced across the altcoin market, with only the best-performing crypto among the top 99 tokens managing to secure double-digit gains, as the altcoin season index remained below 50. The top altcoin gainers for the day were: ai16z ai16z (AI16Z) has gained over 20% in the past 24 hours, bringing its market cap to over $1.6 billion when writing. Its daily trading had fallen 17.6% to $115 million after starting the day with a trading volume of $202 million. Source: CoinMarketCap AI16Z deviated from the broader crypto market downturn after the project shared a plan to update its tokenomics to add more utility to its native token. Ai16z is an AI-focused venture capital fund powered by meme fund launcher Daos.fun. According to its updated tokenomics, the project plans to create an open-source Pump.fun inspired launch pad for its AI projects. Fees generated from the platform will be used to buy back AI16Z tokens from the market and create a liquidity pool. The project also plans to utilize the token as the base currency within its agent-run ecosystem. The updated tokenomics of the project and the increased utility of AI16Z tokens seem to have drawn investor interest. Lido DAO Over the past day, LDO rose 3.2%, trading at $1.84 while its market cap stood at $1.63 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap While there was no particular reason for the recent gains in LDO, the altcoin rallied on the back of a significant surge in trading activity and rising open interest. Data shows a 41.48% increase in trading volume to $193.01 million and a 3.73% rise in open interest to $128.75 million. Traders were likely positioning themselves in anticipation of further gains once momentum returns to the market, considering Lido is the largest defi protocol in terms of total value locked. Ethena Ethena (ENA) rose 2.2% over the past day, exchanging hands at $0.95 per coin while its market cap rose to over $2.7 billion at press time. The altcoin trading volume over the past day was up 85.9% at $500 million. Source: CoinMarketCap ENA bucked from the broader market trend as the research arm of Grayscale added ENA as one of the top 20 crypto assets to perform well in Q1 2025. The recognition gained from such a prominent firm has likely strengthened investor interest in the altcoin and helped it rally amid a falling market. Whales also helped keep ENA in the green as large holder net flows flipped from a $5.14 million outflow on December 28 to a $664,000 inflow on December 29. Though the inflows from whale holders seem modest compared to the recent outflows, it has likely reignited fresh interest among retail traders likely contributing to the token’s price gain.

Since its launch, the presale has generated over $680,000. 2025 is upon us, and there is still time left to get your hands on Solana’s latest memecoin marvel, Husky Inu (HINU). The project’s recently launched presale has exceeded all expectations since going live and is expected to exceed all expectations in the upcoming year. Let’s look at why the expectations for Husky Inu are so great. Shiba Inu Welcomes a New Friend: Husky Inu (HINU) Husky Inu (HINU) is still a pup and has already made its mark in the crypto world. The memecoin made a strong entrance, positioning itself as a strong contender against memecoin giants Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Husky Inu is marketed as Shiba Inu’s new best friend and is trying to dominate the memecoin market. Husky Inu and its native token, HINU, aim to add value and utility to its holders. The duo are working to build a robust, supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, which has captured significant attention from investors. The project has big things in store for its backers, with plans to launch an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). Husky Inu’s Earn App users will receive HINU tokens as a reward for engaging with the project and completing tasks such as liking, reposting, and sharing content. The DEX will facilitate decentralized trading, enhancing utility and value for HINU holders. Since going live, the project has raised over $680,000 in presale. Expectations Are High for Husky Inu (HINU) Husky Inu made a name for itself thanks to its commitment to a reliable token ecosystem. It achieves this through a carefully designed distribution model and capped maximum supply. Husky Inu also boasts a host of unique features, including: Capped Token Supply: HINU tokens are limited to 100 billion to ensure scarcity and value retention. Deflationary Mechanism: 50% of all Husky Inu Exchange and DEX platform fees will be used to buy back and burn HINU tokens to reduce the circulating supply over time. Early Investment Opportunity: Husky Inu successfully launched the HINU presale, allowing early backers to buy their stake for a humble $0.00012500 per token. Charity Voting: 5% of the total Husky Inu (HINU) token supply will be allocated to community rewards and charity, supporting user-voted charities and goodwill causes. Speedy Transactions: Husky Inu leverages the speed and scalability of the powerful Solana blockchain to bring users quick, low-cost transactions. How Can I Join the HINU Presale? Buying Husky Inu presale tokens is very simple, and the project provides guidelines for purchasing HINU tokens today. Husky Inu recommends following the step-by-step guide below: Step 1: Connect a Wallet The presale widget can be found on the top of Husky Inu’s webpage. To get started, users can connect their wallets using various options. Should you encounter any issues or cannot connect, please contact Husky Inu’s official Telegram Channel. Step 2: Select a Network After connecting your wallet, users can join the HINU presale on the Solana chain. You can purchase HINU tokens using native currency or with BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, DOGE, TRX, DASH, BCH, or USDT on Ethereum Tron chains. Step 3: Buy Tokens After completing the first two steps, you can move on to step 3. Specify the amount of BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, USDT, DOGE, TRX, DASH, or BCH you would like to trade for $HINU, and then approve the transaction in your wallet. Remember that you will not receive tokens immediately during the presale but can claim them once it has concluded.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-the-grinch-trumpgri-solana-memecoin-to-explode-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts, get ready! The week is packed with potential, and if you’re hunting for the best crypto to buy this week, it’s time to focus on projects that stand out with innovative use cases and long-term growth potential. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, these three top-tier cryptos could redefine your portfolio. Let’s explore why Web3Bay, Solana, and HNT (Helium Network Token) are worth considering right now. 1. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-Commerce with Blockchain Technology Looking for the best crypto to buy this week? Web3Bay ($3BAY) is reshaping the e-commerce world with its decentralized, blockchain-powered marketplace. This project is eliminating traditional barriers like high transaction fees and limited payment options, creating a platform where merchants and consumers can interact seamlessly. Unlike conventional e-commerce platforms, Web3Bay is fully decentralized, ensuring users have complete control over their data and transactions. It combines cryptocurrency payments with traditional options like PayPal, making it accessible to both blockchain enthusiasts and casual shoppers. For merchants, particularly in underbanked regions, Web3Bay opens doors to global markets without the need for traditional banking systems. What makes Web3Bay stand out as one of the best cryptos to buy this week is its presale structure. Currently priced at just $0.00345, 3BAY tokens offer early investors a ground-floor opportunity. With a 15% price increase at each presale stage and projected returns of over 500x, the platform’s growth potential is immense. Key features include: Decentralized Marketplace: Offers transparency and user-driven operations. Low Transaction Fees: Leverages blockchain to minimize costs. Hybrid Payment Options: Supports both crypto and fiat payments. Security and Governance: Utilizes smart contracts and a DAO model for decentralized decision-making. If you’re searching for a project with tangible utility and exponential growth potential, Web3Bay could easily be the best crypto to buy this week. 2. Solana: Lightning-Fast Transactions for Modern Blockchain Applications In the past week, Solana has demonstrated significant activity within the cryptocurrency market. On December 23, 2024, the Solana network achieved a record-breaking 72.8 million transactions in a single day, surpassing the combined total of other major blockchains. This milestone underscores Solana’s scalability and efficiency, reinforcing its position as a leading platform for decentralized applications. Despite this achievement, Solana’s price has experienced volatility, with reports indicating a decline of over 30% since late November. The platform’s thriving ecosystem and strong developer community continue to push boundaries, making Solana an attractive option for both short-term gains and long-term potential. If speed, efficiency, and utility are what you’re after, Solana is undoubtedly among the best crypto to buy this week. 3. HNT (Helium Network Token): Decentralizing Wireless Connectivity Helium, known for its decentralized wireless network for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has garnered attention due to recent market movements. Analysts have noted that HNT’s price is testing key levels as momentum appears to soften, suggesting potential challenges ahead. Despite short-term gains, technical indicators present mixed signals regarding its future trend. Additionally, Helium’s price predictions indicate a potential rise to $11 in 2024, with expectations of reaching new record highs by 2030. These projections are based on Helium’s innovative approach to decentralized connectivity and its expanding network of active nodes. Investors are advised to consider both the current market sentiment and Helium’s long-term prospects when evaluating HNT as an investment opportunity.

38318486,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376688,1735589852,AI Agents Lead Crypto Narratives With 67% Gains in 30-Day Market Performance,"The crypto market has shown dramatic shifts in narrative performance, with AI-driven technologies emerging as clear winners in the final month of 2024. In contrast, meme coins and modularity projects have experienced significant declines in the last 30 days. Winners and Losers The latest data from Web3 analytics platform Dexu AI shows that AI agents generated an impressive 72.2% return over the past month, led by ai16z (AI16Z) and Phala Network’s PHALA token. At that time, AI16Z saw its value rise by nearly 295%, while PHALA added 209% to its price. Other strong performers here were Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), which gained 132% in 30 days, and the crypto market intelligence token AiXBT, which rose by 125%. Recently, Bitfinex posited that AI agents could revolutionize crypto with their ability to perform tasks like executing transactions, managing digital wallets, and crafting investment strategies. However, the category wasn’t the only success story in December. Centralized exchange (CEX) tokens also performed well, with the narrative climbing 41.37% across the month. Further, the “sweat-spot” sector, which focuses on projects combining blockchain functionality with user-focused applications, saw a respectable 24.4% rise. Other traditional spaces, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and derivatives, experienced relatively smaller but steady growth at 13.2% and 12.3%, respectively. Additionally, real-world assets (RWA) also did well, gaining 7.21%. Nevertheless, the previous 30 days were not so profitable for the rest of the narratives. The retractions were led by the modularity category, which lost 32.1%, and low-risk tokens (LRTs), which dipped by 30.8%. Meme coins also saw a substantial 28.7% decline, possibly reflecting investor fatigue. This was despite a recent Binance report indicating that such tokens had overtaken Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of ownership. Per data from CoinGecko, many of the highest-capped assets in the category, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK), saw their prices dip by double digits over 30 days. The biggest casualty among them was dogwifhat (WIF), shedding nearly 41% of its value in that period. Additionally, GameFi, privacy tokens, and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) also experienced losses, with GameFi sinking 21.78% and privacy coins dropping 12.46%. L1s Top Market Cap In terms of market capitalization, Layer 1 (L1) blockchains remain dominant at $2.75 trillion, pushed mainly by Bitcoin’s $1.85 trillion valuation. Centralized exchange tokens boast the second-highest worth at just over $129 billion, followed closely by meme coins, which, despite a generally poor December, are still valued at nearly $86 billion per Dexu AI. Categories like DeFi and AI follow a bit further behind, with the former capped at just under $39 billion and the latter valued at slightly over $23 billion. Narratives with the smallest market size include privacy coins, LRTs, and decentralized science (DeSci). As of December 30, privacy coins were capped at $2.72 billion, while DeSci remains a niche sector priced at only $284 million.

Investors Are Going All In on BTFD Coin for Their Next Big Win—Don’t Miss Your Chance, Get 50% Extra Coins By Using BIG50!","Did you hear about Brett? This quirky meme coin, inspired by a viral internet sensation, captured the hearts of the crypto world earlier this year. The Brett token skyrocketed in popularity, leaving many to wonder how they missed the chance to join the excitement. It was a perfect storm of social media buzz and a heartwarming backstory that sent the coin’s value soaring to impressive heights. But crypto is never about looking back—it’s all about finding the next big opportunity. Enter BTFD Coin, a meme coin that’s currently making waves with its presale momentum and massive ROI potential. If you’ve been waiting for your chance to get in on the dip and ride the next wave, BTFD is your golden ticket. It’s not just another meme coin; it’s a movement, and it’s already being hailed as one of the best new meme coins to buy this week. With over $4.6 million raised , more than 7000 holders, and a rapidly growing community of Bulls backing it, BTFD is stealing the spotlight. Let’s dive into why this coin is quickly becoming the talk of 2024 and why you don’t want to let it fly under your radar like Brett did. BTFD Coin: Owning the Dip, Leading the Charge BTFD Coin is rewriting the script for what a successful meme coin launch looks like. Currently priced at just $0.000142 in its 13th presale stage, it’s the perfect entry point for investors who know the value of getting in early. With over 60 billion tokens already sold and a listing price set to hit $0.0006, early investors could be looking at a 4.6x return once the coin hits the market. What sets BTFD apart is its vibrant Bulls Squad community. With over 7000 members already on board, the Bulls Squad isn’t just a group of investors; it’s a movement of like-minded individuals rallying together with a shared mission to capitalise on market dips and push the coin forward. Joining BTFD isn’t just about owning tokens; it’s about becoming part of something bigger. Don’r forget to use BIG50 to get extra 50% coins while buying. BTFD’s appeal doesn’t stop with its community. The coin’s developers are building for the long term, and one of the most exciting features on the horizon is its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game.

A time when the global economy seemed to collapse in on itself, but those who had the foresight to invest during the chaos emerged stronger. Well, the crypto world is no stranger to its own roller-coaster moments, and BTFD Coin is a prime example of seizing the right opportunity at the right time. With its presale surging past $4.6 million in just the first month, many are starting to ask: Is BTFD Coin the next big meme coin to hold long-term? When it comes to meme coins, the landscape has evolved dramatically. Initially, meme coins were mostly seen as novelties, jokes in the vast crypto market. But over time, they’ve gained real traction, becoming more serious investment opportunities. So, how does BTFD Coin stack up against other projects like Turbo and COQ Inu? Let’s dive in and explore what makes BTFD Coin a top contender among the best meme coin presales to buy and hold for the long term. In this article, we’ll explore three key players in the meme coin space: BTFD Coin, Turbo, and COQ Inu Protocol. Each one has its unique proposition, but BTFD Coin seems to be setting a new standard with its innovative features, community-driven approach, and impressive presale performance. By the end of this article, you’ll understand why BTFD Coin might be the most compelling investment opportunity in the meme coin space right now. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution BTFD Coin has quickly become one of the most talked-about meme coins in the crypto market. In less than a month, it has already raised over $4.6 million in its presale, attracting more than 7,000 holders who are eager to join the movement. Starting at a presale price of $0.000004 per coin, BTFD has now surged to $0.000142 as it enters Stage 13. This rapid growth highlights the overwhelming demand for BTFD Coin and the widespread belief that it’s set to achieve remarkable milestones in the crypto world. With over 60 billion $BTFD coins sold, the community continues to expand, rallying behind the coin’s mission and meme culture. Don’t miss out—use the BIG50 code during the presale to unlock extra coins and maximize your holdings! The buzz surrounding BTFD Coin is not just because of its potential price increase, but because of the features that make it stand out. BTFD is introducing a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a referral program, staking rewards, and a strong, engaged community that could lead to a substantial long-term value increase. By offering these innovative features, BTFD Coin is positioning itself to be more than just a meme coin; it’s building a lasting ecosystem that appeals to both gamers and investors alike. If you’re wondering why now is the time to jump in, consider this: during the 1973 economic collapse, many investors made the mistake of pulling out during the panic. Those who bought the dips came out on top. Similarly, now could be your chance to take advantage of the BTFD presale before its price skyrockets after the full launch. If you’re thinking about long-term gains, the BTFD Coin presale is one of the best meme coin presales to buy and hold for the long term. $BTFD draws inspiration from the resilience shown by legends like Warren Buffett during the 1973 financial crash. At $0.000142 in Stage 13, it’s an opportunity to buy low and watch your investment grow. Boost your portfolio with the BIG50 bonus! Use code BIG50 during your purchase to gain 50% extra tokens. For example, 100 coins bought means 150 in hand. Don’t miss this chance to secure $BTFD now. Turbo: A Promising Meme Coin but Not Without Its Challenges Turbo has carved out a niche for itself in the meme coin space, boasting a solid community and a focus on real utility in the crypto world. With a lower presale price and a roadmap that promises to incorporate more blockchain-based features, Turbo aims to be a more serious contender for investors looking for long-term growth. However, despite its ambitions, it doesn’t quite have the same explosive growth trajectory as BTFD Coin. Turbo has made strides with its unique approach to governance and staking rewards, but it lacks the same level of excitement and hype surrounding its presale. While its community is growing steadily, it’s still a far cry from the numbers BTFD Coin is pulling in. Turbo also faces tough competition from more established projects, making it harder to maintain momentum. When comparing Turbo to BTFD Coin, the major differentiator is the pace and strength of the presale. Turbo is certainly one to keep an eye on, but for now, it doesn’t have the same magnetic pull or promising ROI that BTFD Coin offers. If you’re after one of the best meme coin presales to buy and hold for the long term, BTFD Coin may be a better bet. COQ Inu Protocol: A Different Kind of Meme Coin COQ Inu Protocol has been garnering attention for its unique take on the meme coin trend. Unlike other meme coins that rely heavily on community-driven hype, COQ Inu aims to create a more structured, decentralized platform. Its focus is on creating a protocol that enhances DeFi (Decentralized Finance) capabilities and offers more than just the promise of a meme coin. While COQ Inu’s roadmap includes some intriguing plans for tokenomics and future partnerships, its presale performance has not been as exciting as BTFD Coin’s. With a smaller, less active community and fewer tokens sold, COQ Inu has yet to capture the same level of investor interest. It’s still in the early stages of its development and, unlike BTFD Coin, doesn’t seem to have the same viral energy driving its growth. For investors looking for the best meme coin presales to buy and hold for the long term, COQ Inu could be an interesting option—but it doesn’t quite offer the same level of immediate potential or return as BTFD Coin. The community-driven nature of BTFD Coin and its robust roadmap give it a strong edge in this competitive space.

As institutional and retail investors poured into the crypto market, ADA enjoyed a brief rally, positioning itself as one of the top altcoins benefiting from the bullish sentiment. However, despite the ongoing rally, the Cardano price has struggled to sustain its momentum, failing to break past the critical $1 resistance level. In contrast, PropiChain (PCHAIN) has emerged as a standout performer, attracting significant inflows from ADA whales. Cardano Price Struggles Below $1 Amid Market Decline The Cardano price at $0.9473 today has seen a significant decline, dropping over 18.86% over the past week and 7.98% in the past month. This downturn is largely driven by the broader cryptocurrency market’s bearish sentiment, with major assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) also facing losses. Profit-taking after earlier gains has also increased selling pressure on ADA, while technical indicators suggest further declines in the Cardano price if key support levels are breached. In response, ADA whales are reallocating funds after an underwhelming month. With all other major utility altcoins and even meme coins facing double-digit declines, many are seeking out the best crypto presale projects to invest in now as they offer a low entry point and potential for explosive gains. ADA Whales Turn to PropiChain (PCHAIN) as Cardano Price Drops Compared to Cardano (ADA), PropiChain (PCHAIN) possesses an even greater revolutionary potential, as the platform aims to tackle the $634 trillion real estate industry's most persistent challenges. This innovative platform is set to redefine how we approach real estate investing, combining cutting-edge blockchain technology, RWA tokenization, smart contracts, metaverse, and artificial intelligence. Although real estate is one of the largest and most lucrative industries in the world, its traditional structure is riddled with fraud, high entry barriers, rigidity, and inefficiencies. For decades, only high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors could access premium real estate opportunities. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is changing all of that. Through fractional ownership , PropiChain allows investors to trade fractions of high-value properties, transforming real estate from an exclusive asset class into one that’s accessible to everyone. With just a few hundred dollars, users can now own shares of premium properties, opening up a trillion-dollar market to millions of new participants. This tokenization of real estate not only democratizes participation but also injects liquidity into a traditionally illiquid sector by allowing for instant property transactions that usually take 44 days on average. Furthermore, PropiChain’s blockchain technology ensures every transaction is secure, transparent, and immutable. By recording ownership and transaction details on an incorruptible ledger, PropiChain eliminates the risk of property fraud, one of the most pervasive issues in the industry. The platform’s smart contract capabilities further streamline operations for asset managers. Tedious tasks like asset leasing, rent collection, and lease renewals are automated, saving asset managers both time and money by reducing operational costs, eliminating expensive middlemen, and ensuring efficiency. Adding another layer of innovation is PropiChain integration of AI-powered tools, which are free for all PCHAIN holders . These tools empower users to make better investment decisions with predictive analytics, personalized property search experience, instant property valuations, and automatic asset trading. Cardano Price Rally Stalls Below $1, PropiChain Set to Explode 17,409% With the Cardano price plummeting after failing to capitalize on the Bitcoin (BTC) rally, investors are now skeptical about the token’s potential to blast past $1 like its rival, XRP. Now, as the broader crypto market declines, Cardano whales eagerly seek out the best altcoins to buy now, with many pointing to PropiChain (PCHAIN). Considering PropiChain's disruptive potential in one of the largest industries and PCHAIN's 17,409% growth potential , it's no surprise why the presale has raised almost $2 million in record time. Forget the Cardano Price – PropiChain Presents 17,409% Opportunity Amid rising bearish sentiments, investors are seeking out stable, realistic, high-potential investments moving forward. Considering the rising interest in RWA tokenization projects, especially from Wall Street giants like BlackRock, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is shaping up to become one of the best cryptos to buy for 2025 . Already, the PropiChain presale has seen massive participation, with almost $2 million worth of PCHAIN altcoins acquired just weeks into the presale. While many regret missing round one, the second round is offering investors a whopping 17,409% returns, potentially turning a $1,500 investment into $262,635 by Q1. However, the window to acquire PCHAIN today at $0.011 is almost gone as the presale traffic tripled following news of early success in the first round, along with trust and excitement around the BlockAudit security audit and PropiChain getting listed on CoinMarketCap . While many investors lament the negative Cardano price movements, ADA whales are piling investments into PropiChain as this is the lowest the PCHAIN price will ever be again from today.

The analyst views the idea of the Dogecoin price reaching a $10 target as akin to chasing fairies in the current market.

In his statement, Mow called the concerns uninformed or agenda-driven, highlighting Tether’s strong market position and historical resilience. With $143 billion in assets under management (AUM), Tether is far from vulnerable, Mow said. “The time of FUD was when the company probably had less than $100 million in assets,” he said, adding that Tether is now one of the top 20 holders of U.S. Treasuries, outpacing all but 18 countries in treasury holdings. Mow also noted the importance of Cantor Fitzgerald, a major financial services firm that backs Tether. According to Mow, Cantor Fitzgerald’s CEO, who has been nominated as the future US Secretary of Commerce, is an indication of the stablecoin’s institutional credibility. Related News: Great Whale's Trouble: He Opened a Long Position in Bitcoin, Lost $6.7 Million, Paid $667,000 in Fees Mow noted Tether’s leadership in the stablecoin market, with trading volumes 16 times that of its closest rival, USD Coin (USDC), and Tether’s role in serving hundreds of millions of users in the southern hemisphere, where it has become a vital tool for financial inclusion. Taking aim at Tether’s critics, Mow offered a “friendly historical reminder” of the events surrounding Bitcoin’s controversial on-chain forks. He accused Coinbase and Circle, the companies behind USDC, of trying to fork Bitcoin and take control of the network. In response, Mow credited Tether’s team for creating on-chain split markets that played a key role in preventing the rise of “fake Bitcoin forks.” *This is not investment advice.

While Chainlink’s potential price surge and Shiba Inu’s focus on interoperability garner attention, BlockDAG Network stands out by directly rewarding its community through its USDT Refer & Earn program. Unlike others that emphasize speculative growth or cross-chain features, BlockDAG’s approach turns connections into tangible value. Its “Refer and Earn USDT” initiative empowers users to earn rewards simply by sharing referral links, with cashback rates rising significantly for active participants. This dual-benefit system reflects a commitment to creating meaningful user engagement while fostering loyalty and sustainable growth. BlockDAG’s Refer to Earn USDT: Your Network is Your Net Worth The BlockDAG presale has been a resounding success, raising $174 million so far in 26 batches of presale, where the BDAG coin is currently selling at $0.0234 and attracting a growing number of participants. Moreover, with its technology and strong community support, BlockDAG has positioned itself as a standout project in the crypto space. To enhance user participation, the Refer & Earn USDT system has been introduced, rewarding both referrers and purchasers for their involvement. This initiative further reflects BlockDAG’s commitment to fostering a thriving ecosystem where everyone benefits. The “Your Network is Your Net Worth” approach showcases how users can leverage their connections to earn rewards. Specifically, by sharing a referral link, referrers earn instant cashback in USDT, with rates increasing up to 10% for multiple purchases within 24 hours. Consequently, this structure encourages active participation, transforming social and professional networks into valuable earning opportunities. For influencers and marketers, this system is particularly attractive, making BlockDAG’s approach beneficial for everyone involved. Simultaneously, the “Make Every Purchase Count” approach ensures that purchasers are not left behind. By offering a consistent 6% cashback on every transaction, buyers receive meaningful rewards for every eligible purchase. Thus, this dual-benefit system creates a balanced and fair experience, fostering trust and long-term engagement. Purchasers know that their spending directly translates into rewards, encouraging loyalty and repeat transactions. Overall, these approaches highlight BlockDAG’s dedication to creating an inclusive and rewarding platform. Whether users are leveraging their network or simply making purchases, BlockDAG ensures its community continues to grow and benefit. Chainlink Poised to Surpass $52 in Early 2025 Chainlink (LINK) is on track to exceed its all-time high of $52 by the first quarter of 2025. Currently, trading at $23.95, LINK has rebounded from a multi-year trend line, signaling strong buyer interest and bullish momentum. Furthermore, this upward trajectory is supported by increased trading volumes, indicating growing investor confidence. In addition to this trend, a significant whale transaction involved the withdrawal of 55,199 LINK tokens (approximately $1.33 million) from Binance during a recent price correction. Notably, over three days, this whale moved a total of 105,720 LINK, suggesting strategic accumulation in anticipation of a price surge. Moreover, in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector, Chainlink leads with a market capitalization of $15 billion, underscoring its dominance and positive investor sentiment. If this momentum continues, LINK is well-positioned to break past the $52 resistance, setting new highs in early 2025. Shiba Inu and Chainlink Forge Partnership to Enhance Blockchain Interoperability Shiba Inu has partnered with Chainlink to integrate the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and Cross-Chain Tokens (CCT) into its Shibarium Layer 2 network. As a result, this collaboration enables Shiba Inu’s tokens—SHIB, BONE, and LEASH—to operate seamlessly across 12 different blockchains, enhancing their accessibility and utility. In addition, by adopting Chainlink’s interoperability standards, Shiba Inu aims to expand its ecosystem, facilitating secure and efficient token transfers across various blockchain networks. This move strategically positions Shiba Inu for broader adoption in the increasingly interconnected digital landscape. Moreover, the integration of Chainlink Data Streams will provide Shibarium with low-latency, high-frequency market data, crucial for optimizing performance in decentralized finance (DeFi) markets. Final Take While Chainlink focuses on price momentum and Shiba Inu builds interoperability across networks, BlockDAG takes a community-centered approach with its USDT Refer & Earn program. By offering direct rewards for referrals and purchases, BlockDAG not only incentivizes participation but also transforms everyday connections into earning opportunities. This balanced system of benefits fosters trust and long-term involvement, setting a strong foundation for sustainable growth.

Staking activity has kept rising while ETH retreated to $3,400, a 16% drop from its December peak. Related Reading: Whales Are Back: Dogecoin Price Forecast Soars To $20 Due to investors staking record amounts of ETH, the total staked assets have exceeded expectations. Even while short-term price fluctuations have led some to doubt Ethereum’s viability, this surge in staking is a sign of growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term worth. Investor Confidence Indicated By ETF Inflows Another significant development is the increase in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are concentrated on Ethereum. The net total of $2.68 billion has been amassed over the past 25 days, with ETF inflows recorded on 23 days. On December 27, the total net assets of ETFs exceeded $12 billion as a result of the nearly $48 million in daily inflows, data from SoSoValue shows. The Ethereum ETF offered by BlackRock has garnered the majority of these investments, underscoring the institutional interest in ETH in defiance of the recent price decline. The popularity of Ethereum spot ETF reflects the larger crypto market, in which ETFs are starting to be a preferred choice for both institutional and ordinary investors. On the other hand, significant inflows of Bitcoin ETFs in recent months suggest that traditional financial markets are progressively welcoming digital assets. Price Action And Broader Market Dynamics Ethereum’s price decline, on the other hand, illuminates an alternative narrative. Ether’s price drop is likely to be driven by profit-taking following its recent rally and broader macroeconomic uncertainties, as the cryptocurrency market remains volatile. Regulatory pressures and concerns about the likelihood of another interest rate rise have accentuated the cautious mentality of traders. Despite the slump, some analysts see this as a time of consolidation rather than cause for worry. They note that Ethereum’s staking and ETF inflows are strong markers of long-term market confidence. Broader Perspective Ethereum’s most recent advancements occur amid an atmosphere of optimism regarding its ecosystem. Continued attention is being drawn to recent enhancements, such as the transition to proof-of-stake and ongoing scalability improvements. These developments are enabling Ethereum to preserve its leadership in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Related Reading: Bitcoin As A Strategic Asset?

Local Korean news outlet The Hankyoreh reports that the Seoul Southern District Court has sentenced the 55-year-old to two years behind bars and ordered him to pay a fine of 52 million won ($35,367) for receiving money and lavish items as bribes from businessman Kang Jong-hyun. Kang allegedly shelled out 3 billion won (roughly $2 million) in cash and over $272,000 worth of luxury watches, designer bags and exclusive restaurant membership cards to get a coin listed on Bithumb. Kang received a sentence of one year and six months of jail time for breach of trust charges. The bribery scheme also involved former professional golfer Ahn Sung-hyun, who served as the middleman responsible for receiving and delivering the cash and goods. The court said that he deceived Kang when he took a large portion of the money intended for Lee. Ahn was sentenced to four years and six months in prison. Bithumb is South Korea’s largest crypto exchange by daily trading volume and a coin listing can potentially drive up prices. The price of PONKE ( PONKE ) and Raydium ( RAY ) surged after the platform announced spot trading support for these two Solana ( SOL )-based crypto assets last month.

However, as the crypto market matures, long-term holders reassess their portfolios, seeking projects with solid fundamentals, real-world application, and sustainable growth potential. This has led many to turn their attention to PropiChain (PCHAIN), an emerging, blockchain-powered real estate poised to power the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. With its unique value proposition, leading industry analysts strongly project that PCHAIN will hit 40,000% growth in the coming months. PCHAIN's staggering 40,000% growth potential has made it a compelling option for Dogecoin long-term holders looking to diversify their holdings beyond memecoins. For these Dogecoin long-term holders, PropiChain's appeal lies in its innovative approach to revolutionizing the multi-trillion-dollar real estate market. By bridging the gap between traditional property markets and the blockchain, PCHAIN has positioned itself as a leader in the tokenized asset revolution. As Dogecoin investors rotate to PCHAIN for stability and transformative growth, the platform's growing ecosystem signals a huge shift in the crypto investment landscape. Dogecoin Dwindling Wave and the Emergence of PropiChain Dogecoin (DOGE) began its journey as a 'joke' crypto asset but has quickly gained traction thanks to its vibrant community, celebrity endorsements, and viral social media presence. At its peak, Dogecoin reached a market capitalization of over $80 billion in 2021. However, DOGE's reliance on community sentiment and meme culture has made it highly volatile. While many early adopters have enjoyed significant returns, long-term holders have faced challenges as the Dogecoin growth momentum has slowed in a more mature crypto market. Over the last 2 weeks, Dogecoin has lost over 20% of its market value, a growing concern for long-term investors. However, the emergence of PropiChain has brought a glimmer of hope as the project promises a 40,000% growth potential in a few months. As a revolutionary blockchain-based real estate platform, PropiChain uses smart contracts, artificial intelligence, the Metaverse, and RWA tokenization technology to redefine the future of the $600 trillion global real estate. What sets PCHAIN apart is its dual appeal to risk-averse investors and growth-seekers. The platform's emphasis on tokenizing tangible real estate properties offers stability that is often missing in assets like Dogecoin. Also, its innovative approach and early-stage development offer up to 40,000% upside potential. Why Dogecoin Holders Are Rotating to PropiChain Several factors are driving the migration of Dogecoin holders to PCHAIN: Enhanced Utility While DOGE's primary use case remains a digital currency for tipping and small transactions, PropiChain's tokenized asset model offers tangible real-world applications. This utility ensures that PCHAIN's value is backed by the world's number one asset class. Stability Through Real Assets PCHAIN's integration of real estate assets into its ecosystem provides uncommon security in the crypto space. This stability protects investors from the highly volatile crypto market, making PCHAIN investment a low-risk and high-reward venture. Market Timing & Growth Potential With its potential to deliver 40,000% growth in a few months, PCHAIN is positioning itself as a high-reward investment opportunity. The broader crypto market has entered a consolidation phase, and many investors are seeking projects with strong fundamentals. PCHAIN's focus on real-world assets aligns well with this shift in the crypto investment landscape. PropiChain's Quest to Revolutionize the Global Real Estate Market PropiChain (PCHAIN) is transforming the global real estate market by harnessing cutting-edge technologies such as smart contracts, artificial intelligence (AI), the Metaverse, and tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA). PCHAIN streamlines property management through smart contracts, automating key processes such as leasing and lease renewals. These automated solutions minimize reliance on intermediaries, reduce transaction costs, and enhance transparency and efficiency in real estate transactions. The platform provides investors 24/7 tailored support through AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots. It offers comprehensive guidance at every stage of investors' investment journey. With advanced predictive AI tools, PCHAIN delivers in-depth market forecasts, enabling investors to identify emerging lucrative opportunities. Another standout feature of the platform is its integration of the Metaverse, which allows for immersive property exploration using virtual reality and 3D visualization technologies. This innovation lets investors virtually tour properties from anywhere in the world, eliminating the need for physical visits. The tokenization of real estate assets represents a groundbreaking development for the real estate sector. By converting real estate properties into digital tokens, the PCHAIN facilitates fractional ownership, making it possible for investors with modest capital to invest in portions of high-value properties. PropiChain is redefining real estate investment by merging innovative technologies with user-centric solutions. Its unique combination of AI insights, virtual property exploration, asset tokenization, and automated smart contract capabilities makes it a game-changer in the industry, offering unprecedented opportunities for investors worldwide. Conclusion The shift from Dogecoin to PropiChain marks a significant evolution in investor behavior within the crypto space. With PCHAIN's 40,000% growth potential, your $1000 investment in the ongoing PCHAIN presale would yield a staggering $400,000 ROI. Join the presale now to enjoy such massive returns on your investment. The project raised over $1.3 million during the first presale round and has reached $500,000 in the ongoing second presale round.

The utility token for the AI agent project ai16z ( AI16Z ) is trading for $1.52 at time of writing, up 23.7% in the past 24 hours. With a market cap of $1.65 billion, the Solana ( SOL )-based altcoin is the 79th-largest crypto project. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down nearly 2% on the day, trading for $91,998 at time of writing. The entire crypto market cap is valued at $3.36 trillion at time of writing, down 3.4% in the last 24 hours. The market strength of ai16z comes as the project is proposing a new tokenomic plan that aims to increase the utility token’s value by better leveraging the benefits of the ecosystem’s AI agent known as Eliza. “The main challenge is that while the Eliza agent framework is thriving in terms of adoption and technical innovation, the ai16z token currently lacks strong mechanisms to accrue value, leading to misaligned incentives. The partners recognize this needs to change to sustain ai16z’s momentum… Overall, there is strong consensus that major tokenomic upgrades are urgently needed to better capture the value that Eliza is creating. An official launchpad is the leading proposal, but with healthy debate on the details and trade-offs.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Is it innovative features, promising returns, or the potential to reshape digital finance? For many, it’s a mix of all three. A few stand out for their unique offerings and value propositions among the plethora of cryptocurrencies. Solana has gained widespread attention for its lightning-fast transactions and scalability, making it a developer go-to. Similarly, Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is redefining how decentralised web services operate, aiming to power the next generation of the Internet. Yet, apart from the rest, is Qubetics ($TICS), a project combining innovation with user-centricity. From its virtual card-enabled wallet to its impressive presale momentum, Qubetics is capturing investor interest like no other. This article will delve into the latest updates and features of Qubetics, Solana, and ICP—three of the best coins to invest in December 2024. Revolutionising Digital Transactions: The Qubetics Wallet with Virtual Card Capabilities The Qubetics Wallet has introduced a feature that could redefine how we think about digital finance: the ability to generate virtual cards directly within the application. Imagine seamlessly creating a secure, temporary card for your online purchases without worrying about exposing your primary payment methods. This innovative functionality boosts convenience and adds a critical layer of security, giving users greater control over their transactions. But the excitement doesn’t stop there. Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session , allowing its community to engage with the team, ask questions, and learn more about the platform’s roadmap. Such initiatives reflect Qubetics’ commitment to transparency and fostering trust among its growing user base. Could this be why analysts call Qubetics one of the best coins to invest in December 2024? The Scalability King: Solana’s Continuing Ascent Solana has cemented itself as a blockchain powerhouse known for its ultra-efficient design and unparalleled transaction speeds. Its proof-of-history consensus mechanism enables thousands of transactions per second, making it a developer favourite for decentralised apps and NFTs. Solana’s ecosystem continues to expand, showcasing its resilience and capacity for innovation. It’s no wonder investors still consider it a strong contender in the crypto space. Pioneering the Future of the Internet: ICP’s Vision Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is carving out its niche as a pioneer in decentralised computing. By enabling web services to run directly on the blockchain, ICP aims to eliminate reliance on traditional centralised infrastructure. Its mission to create a more open and equitable internet has attracted both developers and investors, highlighting its potential as a transformative force in the digital world. Massive ROI Awaits! Why Qubetics Presale is the Best Coin to Invest in December 2024 The Qubetics presale is in its 13th phase, and time is of the essence for those seeking lucrative returns. Each phase ushers in a 10% price increase, with a final-stage jump of 20%. Currently, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.034, with over $7 million raised, more than 10,600 holders, and 355 million tokens sold. For those eyeing an impressive ROI, consider this: after the presale, $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, offering a staggering potential return for early participants. The steady rise in token value and robust community backing make Qubetics one of the best coins to invest in December 2024 . Conclusion Each of these cryptocurrencies—Qubetics, Solana, and ICP—offers unique advantages, making them top contenders among the best coins to invest in December 2024. Solana impresses with speed and scalability, ICP reimagines the internet, and Qubetics leads the charge with its forward-thinking features and outstanding presale performance. However, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out for its unmatched combination of user-centric tools, transparency, and high ROI potential. With its virtual card-enabled wallet and an ongoing presale that promises exponential returns, Qubetics is not just a cryptocurrency—it’s a movement in digital finance. Don’t wait too long, as the presale won’t last forever. Secure your stake in the future today!

It quickly caused a frenzy in the crypto sector, giving rise to Squid Game-themed tokens. For a time, these tokens made headlines in both the crypto and entertainment worlds, but the hype was short-lived. Now, with the release of Squid Game Season 2, these tokens are seeing a resurgence. However, as history proves, profit-making in these markets comes with a risk. The Rise and Fall of the Original SQUID Token The SQUID token emerged when Squid Game became a global hit in 2021. This play-to-earn crypto asset promised quick profits to those who joined the hype early. At its peak, the token rose by over 75,000% but had no official link to Netflix or the show. Investors rushed in to lose everything when the creators executed a “rug pull,” vanishing with millions. The crash, followed by Twitter flagging the token’s official accounts as suspicious, left many investors with heavy losses, making it a cautionary tale in the crypto world. Binance Investigates: A Cautionary Tale for Crypto Enthusiasts After the SQUID token crash, Binance, a leading crypto exchange, investigated the crash. In 2023, Binance said the token was likely a scam, showing how some projects use pop culture to trick unsuspecting investors. The investigation revealed the shady side of crypto investments, where excitement and fraud often go hand in hand. In an interview, Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, shared his concerns about the token. Greenspan noted that if Binance is looking into it for fraud, it is probably not a good investment. He also pointed out that the name “SQUID” was an unofficial copy of the popular show, showing the token’s creators lacked honesty. He advised users to research the project’s team and ensure the token is legitimate before investing in projects like SQUID. Season 2 Sparks New Interest: A Fresh Wave of Tokens As excitement for Squid Game Season 2 grows, the SQUID token and its various imitations have gained new attention in the market. The latest version of the SQUID token, built on the Ethereum blockchain, saw its value jump by 280% in just 24 hours. This increase happened earlier today. While this rise is exciting for some, it’s important to remember past lessons. The re-emergence of these tokens highlights the risks of jumping on the hype around meme coins. In an October interview, Mark Cuban, a billionaire investor and crypto supporter, expressed doubts about memecoins. He compared the memecoin market to a game of “musical chairs.” Cuban warned that all memecoins are like long-term rug pulls with no real-world value . His comments added to the skepticism surrounding the hype memecoins.

38317512,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635035,1735587029,Is Cardano set for a rebound after an almost 40% drop?,"In the last three weeks, the Cardano (ADA) has faced a significant price decline, dropping 37% and slipping below the critical $1 mark. Currently, Cardano is trading at $0.8381, down from highs of up to $1.3264. On December 20, Cardano’s price dropped below $0.8, reaching a low of $0.7673, sparking concern among investors. While there was a slight uptick since that time the market has been notably bearish. If this support fails to hold, it could lead to further downside momentum, with the next target at $0.76. Despite the decline, some analysts believe the token could quickly recover in 2025, including MN Consulting founder Michaël van de Poppe . Cardano could rise above $3 in 2025 or 2026 In an X post on December 30, MN Consulting Founder Michaël van de Poppe predicted that Cardano’s token price could hit record highs of $3.09 in 2025 or 2026. The analyst projected that the token’s price would recover around $0.7460, a critical resistance point for years after the asset’s decline in 2022. With the level breached in 2024, Poppe considers it a support zone for the next price rally. However, ADA must overcome the potential resistance at the $1.2430 mark to see new highs in 2025. He added: The scenario remains the same. Pretty heavy run upwards and a 40% correction. I think we’re getting towards the end of this correction, through which I’m expecting a new leg up for things like ADA. ~ Michaël van de Poppe Some analysts are looking to Cardano’s historical performance as a guide for future price movement. In the past seven years, the ADA token’s price recorded a median 20.4% growth rate in January. That would mean if the token were to follow the same trend, the price should rise by a considerable 20% in January 2025. Moreover, in January 2023, ADA saw a 59.2% growth rate and a 90% growth rate in 2021, emphasizing the token’s success in the month. Cardano faces price drop amid elevated Fed rates Most crypto assets, including Cardano, have experienced a decline in token prices, particularly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that interest rates are likely to remain elevated in the coming months due to persistently high inflation. Although Fed rates have now dropped to 4.25-4.5%, the current rate may stay at this level for an extended period. At the time of writing, ADA’s token price was at $0.8381, trading down by 5.2% in the last 24 hours. Although its price has declined, Cardano’s 24-hour trading volume has surged by 48.42% to $849.09 million.

38317561,https://blockworks.co/news/blockworks-2024-reflections,1735586980,2024 Reflections,"Dear Blockworks Community, Since launching in December 2017, our mission has been to build the world’s best source of crypto insights and information for investors and professionals. We’re here because we believe crypto improves the world by broadening access to assets, increasing transparency, and reducing financial friction. This market moves in extreme cycles, but if you zoom out, you’ll see that every year more and more value moves onchain. This trend will continue for decades, and as it does, the number of investors, founders, developers, and professionals building in crypto will grow by orders of magnitude. These participants will all need access to information to make investments, build companies, and scale protocols. This dynamic will continue to fuel a massive market for crypto data, research, and high-quality insights. From day one, we built Blockworks to provide this information. And as the industry has grown, so have we. Our business is simple Our media channels give professionals and investors the essential news and insights they need to make informed decisions. Our events create the connections that move the industry forward—bringing together executives, founders, investors, and developers to shape the future of crypto. Our data and research provides professional investors with the tools and alpha they need to make smarter investment decisions. And our newly formed advisory business helps protocols build better, stronger businesses. We make money through ads and sponsorships, event tickets, advisory services, and access to our proprietary research and data platform. While it might look simple in theory, execution is everything—and execution in both media and software is tough. Social media and AI are reshaping how people consume news, putting pressure on those who can’t adapt. In the past few years, many of our competitors have either folded or been forced to sell due to these pressures. Meanwhile, if you’re building software products without a robust distribution funnel, that means you’re often forced to spend more than you make to acquire customers. In turn, you become reliant on VC dollars. We refer to this internally as the “VC hamster wheel.” We avoid both these pitfalls by owning the distribution layer and by staying profitable. Default Alive Folks at Blockworks are sick of this story, but I’ll tell it again. Three months into starting Blockworks, Mike and I met with a successful entrepreneur at his office in New York. We wanted his advice. How could we compete with the incumbents (CoinDesk, Cointelegraph), the upstarts (The Block, Decrypt), and the institutions (Bloomberg, WSJ)? At the time, this felt impossible. He gave us one piece of advice that resonated: In an industry as volatile and as vicious as crypto, sometimes all you need to do is survive. This became, and continues to be, a foundational principle for Blockworks. We have run Blockworks differently than many of our competitors. Instead of chasing every last ounce of growth, we have intentionally made decisions that sacrificed all-out growth to stay “default alive.” The culmination of many of these decisions put Blockworks in our best position yet as we headed into 2024. But we still had to execute. Thanks to the best team we’ve ever had, 2024 was our most successful year yet : Advertising and Sponsorships : We hit all-time highs for advertising and sponsorships on both an annual and quarterly basis; Q4 2024 was our best quarter ever. ARR : Our ARR is also at an all-time high, and we now have more than 100 enterprises, funds, and financial institutions who use the Blockworks Research platform. House of Brands : We believe the future of media lies in dedicated niche brands, each serving a unique audience. We now have five strong brands under our umbrella—each with their own podcast, newsletter, telegram community, and soon, in-person activations. Podcasts : We published 672 podcast episodes, which were listened to more than 15 million times across YouTube, Spotify, Apple, and other podcasting platforms. Our podcast network is the largest in the industry, and I believe now one of the top 3 financial podcast networks in the world. Newsletters : As the value of a page view decreases, the value of a newsletter subscriber increases. Our newsletters grew to nearly 200,000 subscribers. Reporting : Our newsroom published 2,230 stories that reached readers in all 195 countries, cementing Blockworks as the go-to resource for crypto news. Following the acquisitions of two other crypto media publications, we are proud that we remain independent. Events: Hosted two of the leading industry conferences with Permissionless and DAS London . Research: Our research team published 159 research reports and is now seen as the leading analyst team in crypto. Data : “Improve the data, improve the industry.” We shipped massive improvements to our data platform, and we now cover user metrics, financials, and token data for more than 30 of the industry’s leading protocols and applications. Advisory: We launched Blockworks Advisory to help protocols sidestep common pitfalls and accelerate their path to success Acquisitions : Building upon our House of Brands strategy, we acquired and integrated both The Drop and The Breakdown into the Blockworks family, strengthening our editorial and insights capabilities. Our Competitive Advantage Our data platform is fueled by the reach of our media channels; our reporting is fueled by our proprietary data and research. This media-data flywheel is the synergy that keeps us ahead of our competitors. No other media outlet has our depth of onchain and financial data, and no other research or data platform has our distribution capabilities. Looking Ahead to 2025 In 2025, you will see us: Become crypto’s defacto data and research platform Double down on our House of Brands strategy, scaling each property and adding new ones. This means growing podcasts, newsletters, and communities, as well as adding in-person components to each brand Turn Blockworks into a talent destination for podcasters, writers, reporters, and researchers. This means finding talent early, building brands around them, and designing the incentives to retain them. It also means investing in journalism at a time when others are divesting Host three of the industry’s best conferences: DAS New York and DAS London for institutions; Permissionless for developers and builders More tightly integrate our media and events with our research and data Help more protocols scale via our advisory business The Little Moments: Day After Day As we look back over the past seven years, building Blockworks has been less about the big moments in time—less about the product launches, the huge hires, and the exciting fundraise. It’s been more about putting one foot in front of the other, day after day after day while making sound decisions that optimize for sustainable, long-term oriented growth. That’s how we survived Covid and made it through both the 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 bear markets. It’s also how we were ready to thrive in this new bull market. And that’s how we’ll continue to build the best crypto media and information brand and platform in the world. Thank You We couldn’t do this without our customers, employees, readers, and listeners. Your support powers our mission every day. As we move into 2025 and beyond, we are more excited than ever about the future of crypto—and our role in it.

It noted that no ETF has ever had such an exceptional debut as it grew to a behemoth with more than $50 billion in assets in less than a year which makes it the fastest-growing cryptocurrency ETF in history. IBIT’s size grew to match the combined assets of over 50 long-established European market-focused ETFs. Todd Sohn of Strategas Securities highlighted this in a note, while Nate Geraci, the President of The ETF Store has called it “the greatest launch in ETF history.” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart noted: “IBIT’s growth is unprecedented. It’s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class,” he said. “At the current asset level and an expense ratio of 0.25%, IBIT can expect to earn about $112 million a year,” he added.

IBIT’s success also marked a significant turning point for Bitcoin, potentially boosting its legitimacy and acceptance in the financial market. It also played a significant role in pushing Bitcoin’s price above $100,000 for the first time, attracting both institutional investors and formerly skeptical individuals. Remarkably, IBIT and other Bitcoin ETFs have contributed significantly to Bitcoin’s 118% price rally this year. Since its launch, IBIT has had only nine days of outflows and typically accounts for over 50% of the daily trading volume in the group. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This steady Bitcoin buying strategy, which has largely paid off since the asset’s price has soared, has continued up until now. Recent data shows that El Salvador purchased another 1 BTC on Dec. 29, pushing the Nayib Bukele country’s total holdings above the 6,000 BTC mark. This substantial stash makes El Salvador the sixth country to hold 6,000 BTC or more. El Salvador Now Holds $562 Million In Bitcoin According to The National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador’s portfolio tracker, El Salvador’s BTC holdings now stand at 6,000.77 Bitcoin, currently worth $562.3 million following its latest purchase. El Salvador holds the sixth most Bitcoin among nation-states, behind only the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Bhutan, data shows. While El Salvador typically adds one Bitcoin per day, it acquired 11 BTC , worth $1 million, just a day after striking a $1.3 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that stipulated changes on its controversial Bitcoin Law in return. In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office Director Stacy Herbert announced in a Dec. 19 post that the tiny Latin American nation may continue to purchase Bitcoin at an “accelerated pace” going forward. Herbert further revealed that the Salvadoran government would sell or phase out its government-sponsored wallet, Chivo . The authorities gifted citizens $30 of free BTC via the app back in 2021. Has Bukele’s Big BTC Bet Borne Fruit? Since making Bitcoin legal tender, President Nayib Bukele has been a vocal supporter of crypto adoption. His government has launched several projects including a Bitcoin mining operation powered by geothermal energy from a volcano and the introduction of Bitcoin-backed volcano bonds. El Salvador also offers a so-called “freedom visa” for crypto enthusiasts. El Salvador bought its 6,000 BTC at an average price of $45,465; it’s now worth $562 million, meaning the country is sitting on over $157 million in profits — a roughly 108% gain on its initial investment. While it’s unclear whether other nation-states will actually follow in El Salvador’s footsteps and stockpile Bitcoin anytime soon, one thing is clear: Interest in holding the world’s largest cryptocurrency as a strategic reserve asset has reached a fever pitch .",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/el-salvadors-bitcoin-buying-spree-continues-nations-stash-swells-to-staggering-6000-btc/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

38316727,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376705,1735585844,Ripple v. SEC Yearly Recap: Was 2024 the Most Important Year?,"TL;DR The Ripple v. SEC case culminated in August when Judge Torres ordered the company to pay a $125 million fine for breaching certain securities laws. The penalty represented a substantial reduction of what the regulator initially asked for. Donald Trump’s election victory and Gary Gensler’s announced resignation fueled optimism among XRP supporters, expecting pro-crypto leadership to influence the case’s resolution favorably. The First Half of the Year 2024 has been quite eventful for the legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the first months of the year, both entities filed various motions in preparation for the trial’s start. For instance, the SEC requested Ripple to hand over essential documents such as the company’s financial statements for 2022 and 2023 and its post-complaint XRP sales contracts. The firm opposed the demand, maintaining that those records were untimely and unrelated to the case. This caused the agency to re-submit the motion, claiming that the documents could offer essential insights into Ripple’s financial history and help determine if the company breached specific securities regulations. The firm reacted with a motion to file a sur-reply letter, seeking “to correct a significant factual mischaracterization made by the SEC.” Eventually, Judge Sarah Netburn ruled in favor of the Commission, ordering Ripple to disclose its financial records for the years 2022-2023. The two entities continued to submit documents and data until the beginning of the trial stage. As CryptoPotato reported , the legal proceedings between Ripple and the SEC reached that pivotal phase on April 23. While many industry participants raised their hopes that this could be a sign of a soon-approaching settlement, the complexity of the court process and possible appeals from both sides mean that the case could be prolonged for a few more years. In May, the popular American attorney Jeremy Hogan claimed that the lawsuit had entered a stage with fewer developments, and both entities had to wait for the judge’s decision. Ripple and the SEC continued to throw punches at each other , clashing over a key witness’ testimony and arguing about the potential size of the company’s fine for violating certain laws. The watchdog sought a $2 billion penalty on the company, alleging it of conducting an unregistered securities offering by selling its XRP token. Ripple disagreed, insisting that the amount should not exceed $10 million. It compared its case to another legal battle between the agency and Terraform Labs, saying allegations of fraud are only present in the second lawsuit. The Court’s Decision In August, Judge Analisa Torres ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million civil penalty for violating federal securities laws through its institutional sales of XRP. It is worth mentioning that in the summer of 2023, the same magistrate found that the company’s programmatic sales of XRP to retail clients through centralized exchanges did not breach the rules. Many industry participants viewed the August ruling as a huge victory for Ripple, considering that the fine represents just a fraction of what the SEC initially asked for. The company’s executives also seemed pleased. CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the firm respects the court’s decision, while CLO Stuart Alderoty stated the organization will pay the penalty in cash off its balance sheet. Nonetheless, the SEC officially appealed in October, triggering a fresh doze of uncertainty. The action means that the lawsuit entered a new phase comprised of filings and a briefing process. Donald Trump Comes to the Stage Many crypto proponents cheered Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections (held on November 5). Those in favor of Ripple and its native token were also among the pack due to the Republican’s promise to fire the SEC’s Chairman Gary Gensler on day 1 after taking office. Gensler has been in charge for over three years, during which time the agency has filed numerous lawsuits against crypto businesses. While some doubted that Trump could fire him (since the SEC operates as an independent entity), the Chairman said he would resign in January next year. Moreover, the newly elected president of the States picked the pro-crypto Paul Atkins to succeed him. The XRP Army expects the Commission’s upcoming leadership to take a less hostile stance toward the cryptocurrency industry and push the case against Ripple to a favorable resolution soon.

38316580,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314634,1735585510,Crypto Analyst Justin Bennett Warns One Factor Could Trigger Massive Bitcoin Plunge – Here’s His Target,"A closely followed crypto analyst is identifying one key factor that could cause Bitcoin ( BTC ) to plummet all the way down to $85,000. In a new thread on the social media platform X, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 115,700 followers that the next time prominent stablecoin Tether’s ( USDT ) dominance level (USDT.D) tests the 4.7-5% area, the crypto king will see a significant price decrease. “BTC is starting to break down. If USDT.D tests 4.7-5%, Bitcoin into $85,000 seems appropriate.” Source: Justin Bennett/X According to Bennett, the market won’t hit its bottom until Tether’s dominance levels reach the target area. An asset’s dominance level is the ratio between its market cap versus the market cap of the entire crypto market. “My plan hasn’t changed. I still think we’ll get Tether dominance into the 4.7-5% area before we see the crypto market bottom. Another 7% to go, give or take.” Source: Justin Bennett/X The crypto strategist goes on to say that USDT.D is on the rise and should hit the 4.7-5% area in the coming weeks. “The weekly chart says it all. Note how USDT.D closed above 4.29% two weeks ago and closed above last week. As long as this is holding on a weekly closing basis, that 4.7-5% area is next.” Source: Justin Bennett/X According to the analyst, as of this morning, BTC bulls have just under a day and a half to turn things around. “Bulls only have 33 hours to turn things around, which seems unlikely given today’s bloodbath from stocks. We’ll see.” The top crypto asset by market cap is trading for $92,046 at time of writing, a 1.9% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homosexual-pepe-homopepe-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-bonk-and-doge-crash/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The Michael Saylor-founded company has acquired an additional 2,138 BTC for approximately $209 million, boosting its total holdings of the flagship cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy Boosts Its Bitcoin Coffers Bitcoin stockpiler MicroStrategy announced on Dec. 30 that it had increased its holdings of the largest cryptocurrency. The Virginia-based company, which already owns more Bitcoin than any other publicly traded company, bought 2,138 BTC between Dec. 23 and Dec. 29. MicroStrategy said it used $209 million in cash to purchase the BTC at an average price of $97,837 per BTC. The firm now holds 446,400 BTC, which is currently worth roughly $41.5 billion, and has spent $27.9 billion to build its Bitcoin treasury. MicroStrategy has acquired 2,138 BTC for ~$209 million at ~$97,837 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 47.8% QTD and 74.1% YTD. As of 12/29/2024, we hodl 446,400 $BTC acquired for ~$27.9 billion at ~$62,428 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/58aXM7g6u2 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 30, 2024 This is the eighth week in a row that MicroStrategy has said it acquired more Bitcoin. Last Monday, the business intelligence firm bought 5,262 BTC for $516 million. The average price was over $106,000, meaning the company bought that batch of coins near the local market top. That said, Saylor has repeatedly indicated that he will continue buying Bitcoin at any price and has no plans to sell. MicroStrategy Plans To Issue More Shares To Fund More Bitcoin Purchases According to a Monday SEC filing, MicroStrategy financed the latest acquisition by selling 592,987 shares during the same week, accruing approximately $209 million in net proceeds. As of December 30, MicroStrategy still has about $6.8 billion worth of shares available for sale from its planned $21 billion equity offering and an additional $21 billion in fixed-income securities. Since announcing its ambitious 21/21 plan in October, MicroStrategy has bought over 194,000 BTC worth around $18 billion, achieving around 42% of its planned investment goal in less than two months. The company sought the SEC’s permission in a Dec. 23 filing to increase the number of its authorized shares for its Class A common stock and preferred stock. This would give MicroStrategy greater flexibility in funding Bitcoin purchases. The firm aims to raise the authorized Class A common stock to 10.33 billion shares from 330 million. Additionally, it seeks to increase the number of authorized preferred shares from 5 million to over 1 billion. Bitcoin was valued at $94,462 as of publication time, representing a 0.8% gain on the day.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/michael-saylors-microstrategy-bags-another-2138-btc-taking-total-holdings-to-446400-btc/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Meme coin market dips 2.23% to $96.5B, but Wall Street Pepe defies trends, raising $38M since December 3rd launch. Table of Contents WEPE seeks to level the playing field for all traders Experts highlight WEPE’s strong community and explosive potential WEPE’s price will increase by another 147% before it launches – here’s how to enter the presale The meme coin market is down by 2.23% in the past 24 hours, which brought its value to $96.5 billion, a far cry from its ATH of $137 billion earlier this month. Despite the bearish market sentiment, Pepe-themed meme coins are seeing gains today, with Pepe (PEPE) and Book of Meme gaining over 3% each. Although most established meme coins struggle to make significant gains, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is bursting through its funding goals at a rapid rate, even when the broader meme coin market faces red trends. Since its inception on December 3rd, the project has raised over $38 million as investors add WEPE to their portfolios to secure their spot in its upcoming trading channel. Let’s take a look at what WEPE intends to bring to the meme coin space and whether it’s a worthwhile investment.

According to the project’s whitepaper , WEPE’s developers intend to share trading strategies, signals, market insights, investment calls, and more, giving WEPE utility. WEPE’s team has also allocated 15% of its total 200 billion token supply to Trading Rewards, a special rewards system that will be available to those following the trading channel. To become eligible for WEPE’s trading rewards, investors will need to follow its trading calls and submit proof of their investment in its VIP channel during WEPE’s upcoming weekly trading competitions. https://twitter.com/WEPEToken/status/1863905080426058015 WEPE’s popularity and early presale success come as no surprise, as it is featured in Best Wallet’s Upcoming Tokens section, which makes it visible to over 100,000 of its monthly users. Previously, Best Wallet featured Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Catslap (SLAP), which left their presale stages and made 600% and 5,500% gains in just 48 hours post-launch, respectively. Since WEPE is currently outperforming them, averaging more than $1 million raised daily, it could repeat their success on launch or deliver even greater returns. Experts highlight WEPE’s strong community and explosive potential Although Wall Street Pepe offers utility by acting as a key to the project’s upcoming crypto signals channel, it’s a meme coin first, and as such, its success largely depends on the strength of its community. The project allocated 38% of its total token supply to marketing, which has already helped it amass an impressive follower count of more than 28,600 on X (Twitter) and 12,000 on Telegram . Besides attracting investors, WEPE is receiving significant attention from crypto experts, including 99Bitcoins, a channel run by a team of meme coin analysts with over 720,000 subscribers. Experts from the 99Bitcoins team see a 100x potential in WEPE, pointing to its growing community and unique approach to the meme coin market. They’ve also pointed out that the project offers a 34% staking APY, allowing investors to passively earn extra WEPE. They see purchasing and staking WEPE as an excellent alternative to investing in established coins that are facing high volatility. The experts have encouraged their audience to start accumulating WEPE during its presale’s early stages, as its price increases every 24 hours, and it has already shot up by 83.05% since December 3rd. WEPE’s price will increase by another 147% before it launches – here’s how to enter the presale WEPE has allocated 20% of its total token supply to the presale, leaving 40 billion tokens up for grabs before it launches on DEXs. The project’s whitepaper reveals that the presale will end on April 25th, 2025, or once the tokens reserved for the presale sell out. Additionally, the whitepaper shows the final presale stage will see WEPE selling for $0.000249, representing a 147% increase from its current price of $0.0003661. WEPE’s per-token price will increase every time a funding goal is reached or enough time passes, which usually happens every day, leaving investors with limited time to secure it at lower prices. https://twitter.com/WEPEToken/status/1873400630863135208 Investors can add WEPE to their portfolios by purchasing it with ETH, BNB, USDT, or a credit or debit card. No minimum investment is required, making the presale equally attractive to whales and casual traders. Besides early adoption, WEPE’s developers also emphasize investor security. The project’s smart contract has been audited by Coinsult , which found no critical threats to investor funds. Plus, 15% of the total token supply is set aside for liquidity, minimizing the risk of a rug pull. Although there are no guarantees when it comes to the success of meme coins, WEPE stands a solid chance to explode on launch if it keeps its momentum in 2025.

38316857,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634494,1735585200,"Cardano Eyes $3 As ADA, DOGE, and Lightchain AI Attract Unprecedented Whale Interest","The cryptocurrency market has entered an exciting phase as large-scale investors, known as crypto whales, are making bold moves, setting their sights on Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Lightchain AI (LCAI) . As Cardano prepares for a potential surge toward the $3 mark, the competition in the altcoin space is heating up. These three tokens are attracting unprecedented attention due to their unique features, strong growth potential, and the high returns they offer to investors who get in early. Cardano’s Path to $3 and Whale Interest Cardano (ADA) has been a top pick for investors because of its careful and study-based way. As one of the top Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains, Cardano gives room to grow and saves energy, making it a good choice for long-term rise. Lately, Cardano’s ADA coin is getting noticed by big crypto players with guesses leaning toward a $3 goal by the end of 2025. The spark for this interest is Cardano’s stead͏y work, which has many new updates and growing deals in different fields. The start of Hydra, Cardano’s way to do more transactions fast, might push speeds to new levels, backing decentralized apps (dApps) and letting quicker DeFi trades. This rise, mixed with the growing use of Cardano apps, is sparking big fish interest; setting up for major price gain. Dogecoin (DOGE) Meme Coin That Keeps Surging While Dogecoin (DOGE) originally gained fame as a meme coin, it has continued to draw interest due to its strong community and continued market relevance. Whales have kept a close eye on DOGE, knowing that its massive market cap and wide adoption provide strong support for further growth. What makes DOGE a compelling investment is its public awareness and celebrity backing—especially as it gains use in e-commerce and payment solutions. Recently, the rise of Dogecoin in the broader crypto community, especially with its ties to Elon Musk’s ventures, has solidified DOGE’s position as a top contender. As Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to lead the market, DOGE benefits from its position as the most prominent meme coin, creating opportunities for whales to ride the market wave. Lightchain AI Rising Star in the Blockchain Space Amid the ongoing success of Cardano and Dogecoin, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is quickly emerging as one of the most exciting presale opportunities in the crypto world. Priced at just $0.0041 during its presale, Lightchain AI has become a favorite among whales seeking new, high-potential investments. Lightchain AI brings a unique value proposition by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, sets it apart from other blockchain networks. This innovation, along with its energy-efficient design and clear roadmap, has caught the attention of top investors. By the time its testnet and mainnet launches take place in 2025, Lightchain AI could see its token value skyrocket as AI-driven applications begin to take center stage in the blockchain space.

The partnership between Ondo Finance ( ONDO ) and modular layer-1 blockchain for RWAfi Plume Network targets RWAfi. According to the two platforms, the aim is to expand access to products such as Ondo U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY) across Plume Network. By combining Ondo’s expertise in Treasuries-backed yieldcoins, and Plume’s RWAfi-tailored infrastructure, the two projects can simplify onboarding and capital integration. Native issuance of Ondo’s USDY on Plume is a step in that direction. Read more: BounceBit partners with Ondo Finance for tokenized real-world assets The flagship Ondo Finance project USDY is currently the fourth largest tokenized U.S. treasuries product with over $450 million in value across eight blockchains. Hashnote’s short duration yield coin, BlackRock;s BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s Onchain U.S. Government Money Fund have their current total value locked at $1.8 billion, $621 million and $554 million per data from rwa.xyz . Launching USDY on Plume will see Ondo bring the 4.65% APY to the platform’s users. It also promises to expand access to the yieldcoin to global individual and institutional investors. However, Ondo does not offer this product to U.S. investors. The collaboration does not just offer an opportunity for the expansion of RWA use cases, but also contributes to the overall growth of DeFi. Katie Wheeler, vice president of partnerships at Ondo Finance, noted in a statement that the partnership will be a boon for the whole industry. “Plume is creating a network effect of opportunities for RWA issuance, and having a composable, yield-bearing asset to power this economy is a boon for both the asset utility and the ecosystem as a whole,” Wheeler said. The Plume Network team has recently sealed several key partnerships and integrations, including with Google Cloud, Chateau Capital and on-chain private credit platform Credbull.

38319264,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323506,1735584471,Germany Accuses DOGE Co-Chair Elon Musk of Election Interference,"A German government spokesperson accused newly-selected Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) Co-Chair and Donald Trump affiliate Elon Musk of attempting to interfere with the nation’s upcoming election on Monday. Germany Says DOGE Co-Chair Elon Musk Is Interfering In Election According to German spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann , Musk tried to influence the outcome of the country’s upcoming national election by backing far-right group, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). US tech billionaire Elon Musk on Saturday reaffirmed his backing for Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in an op-ed published by the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. His comments set off a storm of criticism in Germany. https://t.co/fRMtZ36Sow — DW News (@dwnews) December 30, 2024 Musk made headlines over the weekend for endorsing the controversial political party in an opinion piece published in a German newspaper, prompting outcry from the country’s officials. The X CEO and Tesla founder claimed that he has a right to endorse the AfD given that he operates businesses within the country, though authorities have labelled the group as suspected extremists. “After all, freedom of opinion covers the greatest nonsense,” Hoffmann claimed when addressing reporters on December 30. Donald Trump Sets Sights On Regulatory Changes Musk has repeatedly backed the group on his social media platform, most recently labelling current German Chancellor Olaf Scholz a “fool.” Just over a week ago, incoming U.S. vice president JD Vance seemingly trolled pushback Musk received for his commentary supporting the AfD. As a longstanding ally, Germany’s accusation that the world’s richest man is interjecting himself into the nation’s politics is particularly notable given his new role as co-chair of advisory group, DOGE. Alongside crypto-friendly politician and former Republican U.S. presidential candidacy hopeful, Vivek Ramaswamy, the pair will reportedly alter long-established regulatory frameworks across several federal agencies. “These two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies…,” President-elect Donald Trump said in November. The former reality television has long promised to enact crypto-friendly regulations when he returns to the Oval Office next month. “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference this past summer, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry. The New York-born businessman, who helped to launch his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial earlier this year, has reportedly tapped former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins to replace outgoing chair Gary Gensler come this January. Gensler, who announced his resignation last month, has been widely criticized by members of the crypto community for his regulation-by-enforcement approach to digital assets. It remains to be seen how U.S. regulations and international relations may evolve beginning when Trump takes office on January 20.

The digital asset platform has become the first to be approved under Europe’s regulation. According to the announcement, the company secured approval under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which the European Parliament passed last year. 🏆 achievement unlocked ✅ we've received approval under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in The Netherlands 🌍 this enables MoonPay to innovate crypto payments across Europe! 🫡 2025 is going to be big pic.twitter.com/adLjntXhLo — MoonPay 🟣 (@moonpay) December 30, 2024 The firm secured its license from the Netherlands’ Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). This accomplishment allows the crypto services firm to provide services related to digital asset payments throughout Europe. MoonPay co-founder and CEO Ivan Soto-Wright said, “This approval is a testament to MoonPay’s proactive approach to regulation and our commitment to building a trusted bridge between the traditional financial world and the rapidly evolving crypto ecosystem.” Ivan Soto added, “MiCA represents a pivotal moment for the European digital asset industry, and we’re proud to have worked collaboratively with the Dutch AFM to be among the first to embrace this new regulatory framework.” MiCA requirements are causing big issues in Europe at the moment. However, with their license, there is so much that can be done. In this case, as of today, December 30, the framework is fully in place. MoonPay plans to use this legal clarity to grow its business in Europe. The company also wants to look into new ways to pay and use digital assets while making sure they stay in line with changing standards. What this means for MoonPay MoonPay crypto platform’s achievement after the final filing of the MiCA regulation policy draft has caused a lot of market talk. At the same time, the huge success comes with speculation of a continued bull market in 2025. This has made Dutch investors even more excited. In addition, MoonPay’s new service for Dutch users could help improve the market mood by giving a lot of new investors a chance to trade crypto. Bitcoin and other top crypto are moving very quickly compared to larger trends. This means that buyers should be willing to take small risks. Notably, this win comes at a time when MoonPay is said to be in talks to buy crypto payment provider Helio Pay for around $150 million. If the deal goes through, it will be MoonPay’s biggest purchase since it started in 2018, which will make it even stronger in the market. Are MiCA regulations against or for the crypto industry? Well, MiCA regulations are a bit tricky. Coinbase, a European exchange, eliminated Tether (USDT) and five additional stablecoins from its European platform this month. Coinbase stated that it may reinstate them if they satisfy the new criteria. The exchange asserted that it would be providing issuers with an opportunity to reenter the market by adhering to the regulations. This is because MiCA offers a transition period of 6 to 18 months for stablecoins such as USDt to attain compliance. In response, Tether (USDt) saw its market value drop by $2 billion as exchanges adjusted to the changes. In addition, ByBit stopped certain perks for EU customers because of this regulation. The exchange told its traders, “As part of our ongoing compliance efforts following the upcoming implementation of MiCA on Dec 30, 2024, we would like to inform you about updates regarding your participation in events on the Bybit platform.” Bybit stated that beginning Dec 18, 2024, users from the EEA will no longer be eligible to participate in any events on Bybit. Starting Dec 18, 2024, EEA users (Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland etc.) will no longer be eligible for Bybit events. Make sure to complete any ongoing event tasks by Dec 23, 10AM UTC to secure rewards, with all distributions finalized by Dec 28, 2024‼️ #Bybit #MiCA #Crypto pic.twitter.com/PG1CyKiWJW — Tomek (@miedzybrodzki) December 18, 2024 However, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) has successfully met MiCA’s requirements. This has secured the requisite e-money license and established USDC as a viable option in the EU market. In the same light, Kraken, another significant crypto exchange in Europe, regards MiCA as a critical juncture in the region’s crypto market. To extend its presence, it has acquired the Dutch exchange BCM and is collaborating with local businesses in Spain to further its expansion. Additionally, SIX, the Swiss stock exchange, is contemplating the establishment of a platform for crypto trading within the European Union. SIX endeavors to attract institutional investors by providing a secure and regulated trading environment that capitalizes on Switzerland’s sophisticated regulatory standards. EU’s final MiCA policy is set The final draft policy had new rules and methods for finding and reporting suspicious activities, even when they happened across borders. Crypto asset service providers (CASPs) are required to submit applications for licenses to conduct business within the European Union (EU) beginning in January 2025. A period of up to 18 months enables current providers to continue operations while transitioning to full compliance. This provision allows EU member states to allow existing crypto service providers to operate from December 30, 2024, to July 1, 2026, subject to the duration selected by each state. Nevertheless, this period is not mandatory for all jurisdictions, which means that certain EU member states may provide a lesser period. In addition, the enforcement of the Transfer of funds regulation (TFR) will commence on December 30, 2024. To guarantee transparency and prevent money laundering, CASPs must establish systems for exchanging personal data between the sender and recipient of crypto asset transfers. By July 2026, all CASPs must have achieved full compliance with MiCA regulations. This involves obtaining the necessary permits from their National Competent Authority, implementing strong security processes, and creating operating standards that prioritize consumer safety and transparency.

Real Estate Platform Janover To Adopt Bitcoin As Payment,"A.I. real estate platform Janover announced that it would begin accepting Bitcoin payments in light of MicroStrategy’s success in the adoption of the Satoshi Nakamoto-created cryptocurrency, a Monday press release shows. Janover To Adopt Bitcoin Payments According to the Boca Raton-based company, Janover will accept not just Bitcoin , but Ethereum and Solana for select services in hopes of further aligning itself with market trends. The press release indicates that the reasoning behind the organization’s decision to expand into cryptocurrencies comes from “increasing support” for digital assets in terms of domestic policy. “At Janover, we remain focused on our core business. We do, however, recognize the broadening acceptance and significant future potential of digital currencies like Bitcoin,” said the company’s CEO, Blake E. Janover. Additionally, Janover cites success from “corporate strategies” seen in “broader financial markets” as a means of “long-term value creation.” “We’ve seen how companies like MicroStrategy have successfully capitalized on Bitcoin’s appreciation, and we believe there’s an opportunity to participate in the market in a measured, responsible way,” Janover said. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet News of Janover’s adoption of Bitcoin comes the same day that MicroStrategy announced it had purchased $209 million worth of the cryptocurrency as it continues its strategy of stockpiling the coin. According to Yahoo , the Michael Saylor-led firm’s December 30 purchase marks its eighth straight week buying up Bitcoin following its Fall 2024 surge in value.

MicroStrategy’s latest reported descent marks a 45 percent drop from it’s all time high just last month. As of Monday morning, Bitcoin itself was down nearly two percent. The coin previously reached an all time high of over $108,000 earlier this month following a rally prompted by pro-crypto sentiment surrounding the November election of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial, has long pledged to enact a crypto-friendly regulatory framework when he returns to the Oval Office. In December, he tapped former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins to replace outgoing chair Gary Gensler after years of his regulation-by-enforcement approach to the crypto sector.

38315674,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376690,1735583599,A16z Joins Legal Fight Against Treasury and IRS Over DeFi Rules,"Michele Korver, head of regulation at Andreessen Horowitz’s blockchain arm, A16z Crypto, has voiced strong opposition to the US Treasury and IRS’s newly issued broker reporting rule. In an official statement, she claims that it jeopardizes the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation in the United States. Treasury’s “Midnight” Reporting Rule Lambasted In a December 30 tweet , Korver outlined A16z’s support for a lawsuit filed by the DeFi Education Fund, the Blockchain Association, and the Texas Blockchain Council. This lawsuit aims to block regulations stemming from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which seeks to expand the definition of brokers in a way that could include DeFi trading front-ends. These platforms, which allow users to interact with decentralized protocols, do not directly facilitate transactions, a distinction highlighted in the lawsuit. The groups argue that the rule imposes undue burdens on DeFi entities, violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and exceeds the Treasury’s statutory authority. Korver described the rulemaking process as a rushed “midnight” decision that undermines DeFi’s potential to deliver accessible, efficient, and consumer-focused financial services. She further stated the broader implications of the rule, warning that it could stifle innovation and drive DeFi operations offshore. A16z Crypto even went on to reiterate that it would defend the sector through multiple avenues, including legal challenges and legislative advocacy with Congress and the incoming executive branch. Korver reassured developers that industry attorneys are working to protect this technology, stating that these efforts are critical to preserving the transformative potential of decentralized financial systems. “We believe that this final rule exceeds Treasury’s statutory authority, violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and is unconstitutional. DeFi builders should feel confident that industry attorneys are working hard to protect this technology. We will keep fighting on all fronts – in the courts, and with the help of Congress and the incoming executive branch.” IRS Attracts Backlash Jake Chervinsky, a prominent voice in crypto policy and head of policy at Blockchain Association, also weighed down on the recent developments and pointed out the swift legal response by the crypto industry on the broker rule, which was challenged within 24 hours of its announcement. Chervinsky praised the industry’s evolution of policy infrastructure in the USA over the last couple of years and expressed optimism about the future of crypto and its ability to push back against regulatory overreach. This stance has been echoed by other prominent figures in the crypto space. Unsiwap founder Hayden Adams, for one, criticized the rule’s timing and potential impact while suggesting that it represents a deliberate attempt to hinder DeFi innovation. He expressed confidence in legal and legislative challenges to overturn the rule. Meanwhile, Uniswap CLO Katherine Minarik also said that “there is no good reason for the IRS’s new rule misclassifying DeFi technology as brokers.” The exec added, “It races past the plain limits set by Congress, it will produce far more pointless paperwork than the IRS can handle, it contradicts itself throughout on the tech, and it imposes a burden that could cripple DeFi entirely. All so we can … conduct unnecessary mass surveillance on crypto transactions by everyday Americans. DeFi is the antidote to debanking. The last thing we can afford to do is try to choke it to death next.” The post A16z Joins Legal Fight Against Treasury and IRS Over DeFi Rules appeared first on CryptoPotato .",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | UNI,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/a16z-joins-legal-fight-against-treasury-and-irs-over-defi-rules/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/38315674.jpeg
38315665,https://finbold.com/?p=224348,1735583570,Buy signal for two strong cryptocurrencies this week,"The cryptocurrency market continues to display its characteristic volatility, drawing the attention of traders and investors as they navigate shifting trends. In this context, we spotted two cryptocurrencies displaying strong momentum that could be seen as a potential buy signal. The global cryptocurrency market cap currently stands at $3.43 trillion, marking a 1.4% decline in the past 24 hours, indicative of a consolidation phase as the market seeks direction. Retracements, technical pullbacks, and emerging signals have left the market at a crossroads, offering both opportunities and challenges for participants. Amid this volatile backdrop, Finbold analyzed the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) heatmap from CoinGlass on December 30, identifying potential buy signals across the sector. The average 12-hour RSI of 42.02 indicates neutral market sentiment and moderate momentum, reflecting a balanced yet cautious market outlook. Automata Network (ATA) Automata Network ( ATA ) presents a strong short- to medium-term buy opportunity, supported by solid technical indicators in a market that leans toward neutral sentiment. The 12-hour RSI of 60.32 and 24-hour RSI of 59.58 highlight sustained bullish momentum, significantly outperforming the market’s average RSI of 42.02. This strength signals the potential for immediate gains, setting ATA apart from broader market trends. Crypto Market RSI Heatmap: ATA. Source: CoinGlass Furthermore, its bullish outlook is supported by consistent buy signals across both exponential and simple moving averages for 10, 20, and 50-period intervals. These indicators confirm the asset’s positive trend and provide strong underlying support for continued upward movement. The MACD oscillator also points to further upside potential, affirming ATA’s momentum remains intact. Currently priced at $0.1587, ATA’s recent 7.89% pullback provides traders with an attractive entry point to capitalize on a potential rebound. With strong technical signals and favorable price action, ATA stands out for traders seeking short- to medium-term gains. Secret Network (SCRT) Secret Network ( SCRT ) presents a buying opportunity this week, backed by a robust technical setup that signals sustained bullish momentum, making it an attractive choice for traders and investors. The asset’s 12-hour RSI of 63.32 and 24-hour RSI of 59.37 show its strength, significantly outperforming the market average RSI of 42.02. These indicators highlight growing momentum in an otherwise neutral market environment. Crypto Market RSI Heatmap: SCRT. Source: CoinGlass Furthermore, consistent buy signals across 13 moving averages, including both exponential and simple moving averages over key intervals such as 10, 20, and 50 periods, reinforce its upward trend and provide strong underlying support. Currently priced at $0.5217, SCRT has posted an impressive 5.46% gain over the past 12 hours, reflecting solid buying interest and the potential for further upside. This combination of strong momentum, favorable technical signals, and recent price action positions SCRT as a choice for traders and investors aiming to capitalize on short- to medium-term gains. In a market leaning toward neutrality, both ATA and SCRT have emerged as standout candidates this week, supported by strong RSI metrics and consistent buy signals from key technical indicators. However, market dynamics can shift rapidly, and short-term fluctuations could influence their trajectories. As such, traders and investors are encouraged to exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and ensure their investment decisions align with their risk tolerance and broader financial objectives.

According to data provided by Lookonchain, a whale opened a long position on Bitcoin (BTC) via the wallet Hyberliquid. With the decline in the market, the whale's total losses exceeded $6.75 million. In addition, he paid a total of $632,000 in funding fees for his position, which has been open for 16 days.

38315625,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=668144,1735583455,Ethereum Stays Within Symmetrical Pattern – Analyst Sets ETH Target,"Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $3,400, showing signs of indecision as it fails to establish strong support above this critical level. Recent price action reflects a lack of conviction among traders, leaving the market in a state of flux. Despite this uncertainty, Ethereum has managed to hold above key support zones that could act as a launchpad for a potential rally to new highs. Related Reading: Metrics Reveal Cardano Whale Accumulation – Is ADA Poised For A Rally? Top crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently provided technical insights into Ethereum’s price movement, noting that ETH stayed within a 4-hour symmetrical triangle formation over the weekend. This pattern often signals consolidation, with the potential for a breakout in either direction. While Ethereum’s current positioning keeps bulls hopeful, it also highlights the importance of maintaining these key levels to prevent further downside pressure. As traders and investors closely watch Ethereum’s next moves, the market appears to be at a pivotal moment. Breaking decisively above $3,400 could spark renewed momentum while losing support might lead to a deeper retracement. For now, Ethereum’s resilience at critical levels keeps the possibility of a bullish reversal alive, but confirmation of a clear direction remains elusive. Ethereum Testing Liquidity To Move After weeks of underwhelming price action and a prolonged period of sideways trading, Ethereum appears ready to make a decisive move. The pressing question remains: will the breakout be to the upside or the downside? Renowned crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared his insights on X, revealing that ETH has maintained a position within a 4-hour symmetrical triangle pattern over the weekend. This technical setup often signifies a buildup of momentum, with the potential for a significant breakout in either direction. However, Ethereum’s trajectory is closely tied to Bitcoin’s performance, making BTC’s next move a critical factor. Runefelt has identified clear targets for Ethereum based on Bitcoin’s behavior. If Bitcoin gains upward momentum, ETH could follow suit and push toward higher supply zones, with a bullish target of $3,900. On the other hand, a bearish move from BTC could drag ETH down, with the next key support level sitting at $2,920. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Moves 8,000 BTC Aged 5-7 Years – What Happened Last Time Market participants are now bracing for a potential volatility spike as Ethereum’s price consolidates within the triangle. The coming days will be pivotal, as a confirmed breakout could set the tone for ETH’s price action in the weeks ahead. Whether it’s a rally toward new highs or a dip to retest lower supports, Ethereum is at a crucial crossroads. Technical Levels To Keep An Eye On Ethereum is trading at $3,400 after several days of oscillating between $3,300 and $3,500, reflecting a market stuck in indecision. The tight trading range highlights the growing tug-of-war between bulls and bears as both sides await a clear signal for the next move. For bullish momentum to regain control, ETH needs to reclaim the $3,550 level and establish it as a solid support. Doing so would likely trigger a rally toward higher resistance zones, potentially setting the stage for a larger breakout. However, the risks of downside action remain present. Losing the $3,300 support would expose Ethereum to sub-$3,000 levels, a scenario that could invite further selling pressure and dampen market sentiment.

With uncertainty adding to the already cautious market atmosphere, many analysts anticipate a significant move on the horizon. Whether ETH surges past resistance or slides into deeper corrections depends largely on broader market dynamics, including Bitcoin’s performance and macroeconomic trends. For now, Ethereum’s indecision reflects a market at a crossroads, leaving participants eager for clarity.

This interest was enough for the bank to devote a section of its annual financial stability report for 2024. This has prompted the bank’s Financial Stability Board to suggest ways of regulating crypto-related activities. China Scrutinizes Amidst Hong Kong’s Crypto Expansion Notably, mainland China has banned cryptocurrency trading due to cybercrimes related to crypto assets. However, Hong Kong has flung its doors open to crypto firms. Hong Kong, despite being an administrative region of China has gone ahead to launch a crypto license system for crypto platforms. Since its launch in June, licensed crypto exchanges have established and offer retail trading services. In a significant development, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) recently granted licenses to four new exchanges. They included HKbitEX, Accumulus, DFX Labs, and EX.IO. The regulatory approval further bolsters the region’s position as a global Asian crypto hub. Market observers lauded the development as gaining a license under Hong Kong’s crypto guidelines requires rigorous two-phase evaluation. The government upholds strict regulatory standards as it continues its drive to make Hong Kong a crypto powerhouse. Why is China Concerned? Despite these strict processes, the PBOC highlighted that Hong Kong is “actively exploring” crypto licensing in its financial stability report. It also emphasized Hong Kong’s requirement on some major financial institutions such as HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank. These institutions have been mandated to include crypto transactions in their routine customer supervision. The PBOC reports noted that cryptocurrencies might pose risks in some economies as they continue to gain traction, notably in their application for payments and retail investments. This suggests that the Chinese central bank might have reservations about the development. Hong Kong Legislative Council Debates Stablecoin Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council recently commenced debate on the proposed Stablecoins Bill . The bill, which will pass through three readings, has already scaled the first reading in the Legislative Council. It still has two more readings involving intensive debate and scrutiny before being enacted as law. The bill has several components structured to protect consumers and addresses all market participants. Some experts say it mirrors Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations.

Web3Bay (3BAY) Web3Bay is quickly becoming a key player in the decentralized e-commerce arena, revolutionizing how we shop online by cutting out the middlemen. Utilizing blockchain technology, it promotes transparency, security, and empowerment for its users.

With the global Web3 market expected to skyrocket past $5 billion by 2030, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leader among the best crypto coins to consider, blending cutting-edge innovation with a promising growth path. 2. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin continues to hold its ground as a foundational element of the crypto market, reinforcing its status as the digital counterpart to gold. With a finite supply of 21 million coins and growing institutional interest, BTC keeps attracting both individual and corporate investors. Its recent price upswings and enhancements, like the Bitcoin Ordinals for NFTs, further enhance its allure. As a pillar of stability in choppy markets, Bitcoin proves itself as one of the premier bullish cryptos to snag. Its role as a wealth reserve and inflation shield secures its position at the top of global investment portfolios. 3. Binance Coin (BNB) As the utility token of Binance, the largest global crypto exchange, Binance Coin brings an array of benefits. It reduces trading fees on its platform and fuels a variety of decentralized applications on the Binance Smart Chain. BNB is essential to the wider crypto ecosystem. Its deflationary policy, characterized by consistent coin burns, boosts its scarcity and potential for appreciation. BNB's steady growth and increasing uses in areas like gaming, DeFi, and NFTs rank it among the best crypto coins to pick up in 2024. Binance’s worldwide clout promises ongoing momentum for BNB. 4. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum lays the groundwork for decentralized applications and smart contracts, offering unmatched flexibility in the blockchain domain. Its shift to a proof-of-stake consensus via Ethereum 2.0 has markedly boosted its scalability and environmental friendliness. Supporting everything from decentralized finance to non-fungible tokens, Ethereum is a hub of innovation. With ongoing enhancements in layer-2 technologies and robust developer backing, Ethereum affirms its status among the best crypto coins to buy. Its dynamic ecosystem and pivotal role in driving Web3 developments ensure its continued importance in the expanding crypto universe 5. XRP XRP, Ripple’s flagship token, is reshaping international payments with its ultra-rapid transaction capabilities and minimal fees. Aimed at linking traditional banking with blockchain, RippleNet has forged alliances with leading global financial bodies. Fresh legal victories in the U.S. have revitalized confidence in XRP, supporting a bullish outlook. As blockchain integration within financial services increases, XRP continues to be one of the best crypto coins to acquire. Its scalable solutions for global payments position it as a central player in the future of decentralized finance. Key Insights Treading through the dynamic crypto market can seem overwhelming, but focusing on innovation and long-term viability is key to identifying the best crypto coins to invest in. Web3Bay is at the forefront with its disruptive e-commerce model, while stalwarts like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain essential pillars of the crypto sector. The utility of Binance Coin and the payment solutions from XRP complete this list, demonstrating a mix of established and emerging forces. Each project brings unique benefits to the modern digital economy. As always, diligent research and strategic analysis are paramount when exploring these compelling crypto opportunities.

38318871,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/top-5-best-online-crypto-wallets-for-safe-easy-trading,1735582975,Top 5 Best Online Crypto Wallets for Safe & Easy Trading!,"The crypto market is a battlefield of innovation, where every day new opportunities spring up like wildflowers. For traders to harvest these opportunities, they need tools that offer both speed and adaptability—traits that traditional wallets often lack. The cream of the crop in online crypto wallets provides not just swift access to the market but also advanced features that give users a competitive edge. Beyond sheer velocity, the perfect wallet melds user-friendliness with robust security and opportunities for lucrative rewards. Let’s dive into an exploration of five best online crypto wallets: Plus Wallet, Best Wallet, Bitget Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and Exodus. We'll peel back the layers of each wallet's features and benefits to assist you in selecting the right one for rapid market entry and optimal gain enhancement. 1. Plus Wallet: Elevate Your Crypto Experience Imagine a tool that not only bridges various blockchain realms but does so with an ease that belies its powerful capabilities. Plus Wallet is that tool—a multi-chain online wallet designed for simplicity and power. Supporting a spectrum of networks including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, it offers users a passport to multiple blockchain nations from one consolidated platform. Plus Wallet evolves with its community, adding new chains through votes, thereby broadening trading vistas and aligning with user needs meticulously. Security isn’t just a feature—it’s a cornerstone, with robust encryption and local key storage that lock out unauthorized access and give users the reins over their assets. Moreover, Plus Wallet enriches the trading voyage with a rewards program that turns every transaction into a more profitable venture. With its user-friendly interface, stringent security measures, and additional perks, Plus Wallet is a beacon for those seeking to navigate various blockchains with assurance and grow their wealth actively. 2. Exodus Wallet: Simplify Your Crypto Exchanges Exodus is your straightforward, user-friendly crypto wallet supporting over 1,000 cryptocurrencies across more than 50 networks. Available on both desktop and mobile platforms, it features an in-app exchange that negates the need for external services. However, it falls short of supporting direct crypto-to-fiat exchanges and lacks two-factor authentication, which might be a deal-breaker for security-conscious users. 3. Best Wallet: Your Privacy Shield in Crypto Best Wallet offers a sanctuary for your digital assets without custody, supporting over 50 blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. It empowers users to manage diverse cryptocurrencies under the umbrella of heightened security by allowing them to hold their private keys. No KYC needed means you can start trading immediately. From basic transactions like sending and receiving to swapping currencies, it covers all bases. Additionally, its Best Dex feature facilitates cross-chain swaps among over 200 decentralized exchanges to secure the best transaction rates. However, the gate to advanced features opens only for holders of $BEST tokens. 4. Bitget Wallet: Your Web3 Gateway Step into the future with Bitget Wallet, a non-custodial Web3 wallet that’s more than just a place to store digital currencies. It supports dynamic features such as token swaps, staking, NFT trading, and access to over 20,000 DApps across multiple blockchains. It ensures safe transactions with a keyless setup and arms traders with tools like Smart Money Alerts and advanced charting. Additionally, it simplifies paying gas fees across chains with options like USDT, USDC, or BWB. However, its integration with the Bitget exchange might not sit well with those who prefer a wallet unaffiliated with specific exchanges. 5. Coinbase Wallet: Dive into DeFi & dApps Coinbase Wallet is a veritable Swiss army knife in the world of cryptocurrencies, supporting a wide range including ERC-20 tokens, NFTs, and mainstream coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin. It allows users to plunge into the DeFi space, engage with dApps, and acquire NFTs independently of a Coinbase.com account. It also ensures security compatibility with hardware wallets like Ledger. However, its non-fully open-source nature could spark transparency concerns, and its linkage with Coinbase might raise eyebrows among those valuing independence and privacy. Which Is the Best Online Crypto Wallet For You? Each wallet shines with unique features that secure its spot among the best online crypto wallets today. However, the benefits vary based on what you need. Exodus and Coinbase Wallet are ideal for those who favor seamless, integrated exchanges, while Best Wallet appeals to those seeking a robust, multi-chain experience albeit with some feature restrictions for non-token holders. Plus Wallet distinguishes itself with a user-friendly platform that doesn’t skimp on powerful features or rewards, making it a prime choice for those looking to generate passive income efficiently. Choosing the best online crypto wallet is crucial, and should be guided by your specific trading needs and goals, ensuring you make the most informed decision possible.

38315353,https://coinpedia.org/?p=400244,1735582861,Bitcoin’s Final Days of 2024: Will the Price Rally Beyond $100k?,"The post Bitcoin’s Final Days of 2024: Will the Price Rally Beyond $100k? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As December comes to a close, analyst Crypto Rus reflects on what the final days of the month might hold for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Despite the anticipation of a “Santa Rally,” the market has remained relatively stagnant. Bitcoin saw a surge just before Christmas, touching the $100,000 mark before falling back to around $94,000, where it currently hovers. A Look Back at 2024 and the Market’s Surprising Move Historically, Bitcoin has seen a pattern of price increases heading into January after breaking previous cycle highs. This was the case in 2016, 2020, and 2023. But what’s different this year? For the first time ever, Bitcoin broke its previous all-time high of $69,000 in March 2024, months before the anticipated halving event. This early surge caught many by surprise, but according to the analyst, it’s a sign of how the market is ahead of the typical cycle. While the past few months have seen some consolidation, there’s no reason to be bearish. In fact, Crypto Rus believes the real action may be coming in 2025. Why December Wasn’t the Month We Expected Despite a strong start to December, Bitcoin’s performance has plateaued . “The first two weeks of December were fantastic,” says Rus, pointing to consistent new highs being set. However, the latter half of the month has seen a bit of a slowdown, with some profit-taking and tax harvesting likely contributing to the market’s stagnation. He attributes the lack of a “Santa Rally” to the fact that Bitcoin has already experienced significant gains this year and is simply ahead of the usual cycle. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH About to Explode-May Form A New ATH in Q1 2025 , Looking Ahead to 2025: Big Moves for Bitcoin Looking into the new year, Rus is extremely bullish about Bitcoin’s potential. With Bitcoin’s supply shock in full effect and large institutional players like blackrock blackrock - Fintech Solution Advisory Investment platform now owning over 2% of Bitcoin’s supply , the stage is set for a major bull run in 2025. Rus believes that these entities’ increased purchases will drive prices higher in the short term, but in the long run, it could pose a challenge for decentralization. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is slightly trading above the $94k mark and it remains to be seen if the bulls will push the price beyond $100k in the next 24 hours. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38315469,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635021,1735582814,"Ethereum still leads DEX trading in 2024, but Solana almost caught up","Ethereum (ETH) was still the leader of DEX activity for 2024, at least in terms of trading volumes. The Uniswap V3 contract was among the most widely used throughout the year, offering the best liquidity for wrapped ETH and stablecoins. Ethereum still surpassed other chains in its yearly DEX activity and volumes. Despite lagging meme token launches, Ethereum hosted significant liquidity through Uniswap V3, which still has not been replaced on L2 chains or any other network. In the past 12 months, Ethereum DEX achieved $674B in trading volumes, still surpassing Solana’s $626B. BNB Chain took the third spot with $352B. The year-end results formed after Solana led DEX activity for the last quarter. Over the year, DEX activity was mostly concentrated on 15 chains, which reflected other metrics such as daily active wallets and transaction counts. In total, eight L1 chains took up a significant part of the DEX traffic. In addition to Solana and Ethereum, DEX activity concentrated on BNB Chain, Avalanche, SUI, TRON, Aptos, and TON. Meme tokens drove DEX activity on most top chains, with the most active dedicated markets on Ethereum, Solana, BNBChain, and TON. DEX also had a different profile, with a mix of meme activity and high-liquidity pairs of blue-chip assets. The 2024 trend does not yet reflect Hyperliquid, which only recently launched its native HYPE token and increased its activity. DEX activity is back to 2022 levels DEX value locked is yet to return to the levels of 2021. Currently, DEX on all chains lock in $24.46B , recently reaching a yearly peak. Ethereum retains $8.46% of overall DEX liquidity, with pools available in some of the leading stablecoins. Both the market as a whole and Ethereum’s DEX activity have rebuilt their value to levels not seen since the end of 2022. The overall DEX sector will end the year with an expansion streak for December. Overall DEX activity has been recovering gradually. While liquidity providers still receive rewards, the available DEX have seen a decrease of farming tokens. In 2024, DEX also carried more high-quality, high-liquidity pairs. In the last two months of 2024, Uniswap achieved more than $90B in trading volumes, double the activity compared to Q3. Net deposits grew to $7.25B, the highest level in the second half of the year, based on TokenTerminal data . One of the reasons for Uniswap’s growth is also Base, which offers much cheaper transactions. As a whole, Uniswap’s volumes grew on both Ethereum and L2, boosting the overall score for all DEX. Just checked the chain: Monthly L2 volume on the Uniswap Protocol just hit a new all-time high What a way to end the year 🦄 pic.twitter.com/TrygEaa2OS — Uniswap Labs 🦄 (@Uniswap) December 30, 2024 Over the course of the year, most DEX were in close competition, depending on the currently viable trend. Solana’s activity with meme tokens and AI agents put Raydium and Jupiter among the top performers , but Ethereum retained older and highly liquid pairs against stablecoins. Ethereum DEX was also key for moving between Wrapped ETH (WETH) and stablecoin, helping Uniswap V3 reach nearly $1B in daily volumes. Solana saw a migration of protocols in 2024 One of the initial ideas of Solana was to compete with Ethereum, possibly with its own collection of apps. The past year saw a migration of DEX and other protocols, leading to the increased inflow of stablecoin liquidity. After the crash of FTX, Solana spent years without significant apps and DeFi. As a sign of regained trust, Solana attracted several protocols. One of the most notable migrations that started in 2024 was Sky Protocol, formerly Maker DAO. Ondo Finance, one of the largest RWA tokenization protocols, also launched its app on Solana. Renzo Protocol also built its re-staking version on Solana, partnering with JitoSOL. Solana also attracted bridged cbBTC, Coinbase’s wrapped version of Bitcoin (BTC). Pudgy Penguins also chose Solana for the launch of its native token, PENGU. Simon’s Cat (CAT) also chose the network for its high-profile meme token. The increased Solana activity depended on Raydium, while also using the routing and optimization services of Jupiter. Solana trading remains heavily dependent on bots, carrying more than 86% of bot traffic.

A recent Constitutional Convention has also put a spotlight on Cardano’s dedication to decentralization, with worldwide representatives refining its governance protocols. Current Cardano prediction suggests a consistent upward trajectory, with analysts watching for a potential surge past the $1 threshold. In trading terms, ADA is priced around $0.87, encountering resistance yet supported by a robust community base. With advancements in governance and the continued development of smart contracts, Cardano is expanding its footprint in the DeFi and NFT sectors. The latest Cardano prediction sees a bright future, driven by its strides in innovation and scalability enhancements. Market Movements to Watch Chainlink's network growth, underscored by strategic partnerships with entities like Swift and UBS and its unique MEV solutions, keeps Chainlink's price in the spotlight for market watchers.

38315221,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27899,1735582623,German Ex-Finance Minister Advocates ECB to Include Bitcoin into Reserves,"Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner called on the ECB and Germany’s Bundesbank to add BTC into their reserve lists. This came against the background of already growing recognition of cryptocurrency around the world as a strategic financial asset. Speaking in Berlin, Lindner compared the U.S. with Europe and spoke of the debates in Washington to add cryptocurrencies to the Federal Reserve’s reserves. He labeled this policy as “progressive” and also warned how Europe must not lag in the fast-growing crypto universe. A Decentralized Hedge Against Political Risks Mr. Lindner outlined that the decentralized structure of Bitcoin reduces political risks and might serve as a hedge against such traditional reserve assets as gold or foreign currencies. He also noted that though cryptocurrencies can be very volatile, the same happens with classic assets like metals. Crypto assets now account for a significant part of the global increase in prosperity”, said Lindner. He explained that the inclusion of BTC in central bank reserves will provide additional resilience to Europe’s financial system and overall stability. Germany’s Engagement with Bitcoin Germany has already engaged with BTC, though with mixed strategies: The German government this year has been transferring Bitcoin holdings to a variety of wallets-a move that has engendered debate among policymakers. The lawmaker Joana Cotar criticized the government’s move and said that selling Bitcoin was “not sensible and counterproductive.” She instead provided a detailed Bitcoin strategy that could involve holding Bitcoin in national reserves, issuing Bitcoin bonds, and creating a supportive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Strengthening Europe’s Crypto Standing This statement by Lindner is not out of place, considering wider European efforts toward competing in the global crypto space. He urged the ECB and Bundesbank to weigh the option of adding Bitcoin into their reserves and underlined how important it is that Europe remain relevant in the financial world. He further emphasized that both are independent institutions and can handle the decision-making process of this matter without any kind of interference from outside. “Germany and Europe must not allow themselves to be left behind again”, Lindner said, reiterating the need for proactive steps to integrate BTC into the financial ecosystem in Europe. Addressing these challenges and opportunities, Lindner places the means to propel Europe in a more forward-looking way, remaining at the frontier of financial innovation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/german-ex-finance-minister-advocates-include-bitcoin/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Chainlink Price Gains Amid Network Expansion Chainlink continues to attract attention as its innovative oracle technology integrates deeper into decentralized finance (DeFi) systems. Recent collaborations, like its partnership with Swift and UBS Asset Management, have demonstrated Chainlink's ability to bridge traditional finance with blockchain. The launch of its Miner Extractable Value (MEV) solution aims to recapture profits for DeFi users, positioning Chainlink as a crucial player in enhancing fairness and security in the ecosystem. Currently, the Chainlink price is hovering around $21.10, reflecting strong market interest despite recent volatility. On the technical side, Chainlink's expanding ecosystem now includes partnerships with major projects like Aave, which may soon adopt Chainlink's MEV solution. This innovation, alongside its ability to offer secure, real-world data to blockchains, solidifies its long-term potential. As the Chainlink price looks to test resistance levels near $23, its network developments highlight its growing utility and relevance. Cardano Prediction: Scaling New Heights with Hydra Cardano is advancing its reputation as a scalable and community-driven blockchain with its recent updates. The introduction of Hydra, its Layer 2 scaling solution, promises to handle up to 100,000 transactions per second, setting the stage for increased adoption. The recently held Constitutional Convention further highlighted Cardano’s commitment to decentralization, as global delegates refined its governance principles. Current Cardano prediction models suggest steady growth, with analysts keeping an eye on its potential for a price rebound beyond the $1 mark. In the market, ADA is trading at approximately $0.87, facing resistance but maintaining strong community backing. With its governance enhancements and ongoing development of smart contract capabilities, Cardano's ecosystem is expanding into DeFi and NFTs. For those eyeing long-term blockchain investments, the latest Cardano prediction indicates promising growth fueled by innovation and scalability improvements. Key Insights Chainlink’s expanding network, with partnerships like Swift and UBS, and its focus on MEV solutions, keeps the Chainlink price on traders' radar. Meanwhile, Cardano’s Hydra scaling solution and governance updates solidify its position as a leading blockchain, with optimistic Cardano prediction models hinting at future growth.

Crypto predictions for 2025 range from meme coin enthusiasts forecasting a supercycle to Bitcoin maxis projecting the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the United States. However, the most widely agreed-upon point is the start of the highly-anticipated “altseason”. All eyes are now on Ethereum, XRP and new altcoins like Best Wallet Token , which could see outsized growth in 2025. Crypto Predictions 2025 - Ethereum To $6000? There is a growing consensus amongst experts that the Ethereum price could hit $6000 in 2025. For instance, prominent trader Crypto Tony has used Elliot Wave Theory to project that the ETH price could surge to $6,300 in early 2025, provided it doesn’t fail to defend the $3,200 support level. Similarly, analyst Mikybull Crypto highlights that Ethereum’s continued consolidation above the 0.618 Fibonacci Level suggests a rally to the 1.618 Fib level, which is currently at $6,000. The falling Bitcoin Dominance also suggests that ETH could outperform BTC next year, ushering in the highly-anticipated “altseason”. BlackRock’s Head of ETF Jay Jacobs has also revealed that the $11.5 trillion asset management company has just scratched the surface with its spot Ethereum ETF, despite holding over $3.5 billion worth of ETH. Could The XRP Price Hit the $10 Mark In 2025? There have been a plethora of crypto predictions regarding XRP, almost all bullish in nature. It is hard to find any cryptocurrency that has benefitted more from Donald Trump’s US Presidential victory than XRP. It is not without any reason that the XRP price has surged by over 460%, reaching a multi-year high of $2.80. President-elect Trump has already appointed a pro-crypto SEC Chair in Paul Atkins. The odds are now extremely high that the SEC will drop its lawsuit against Ripple. Moreover, the agency could also approve spot XRP ETFs. Experts have also suggested that there is a significant institutional demand for XRP. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has repeated on multiple occasions that XRP could become the second-largest cryptocurrency once again, a spot it held before the SEC’s lawsuit. In that scenario, it wouldn’t be a surprise if the XRP price hits $10 in 2025. New Altcoins In High Demand In 2025 Ethereum’s strength will usher in the altseason, which will result in a strong demand for new altcoins. Smart money investors are front-running this scenario, already stacking low-cap crypto coins. For instance, the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has already raised over $6 million in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) amid strong whale and retail interest. $BEST is the native token of Best Wallet, one of the leading Bitcoin and crypto wallet brands. Best Wallet shot up in fame recently due to its strong growth and is currently seeing a 50% MoM increase in its user base. The company aims to capture 40% of the $11 billion non-custodial wallet business by 2026. As such, Best Wallet already has an edge over chain-specific wallets like MetaMask and Phantom. Its users can buy, swap and store crypto from over 60-plus chains. Moreover, cutting-edge features like Best Card, Best DEX, staking aggregator, presale aggregator, etc., have made it a one-stop shop for all things crypto. With Best Wallet’s strong growth, it is no surprise that smart money investors are betting on $BEST, with some eyeing up to 10x returns from it. Users are also taking advantage of Best Wallet’s unique “Upcoming Tokens” feature, which allows investors to buy trending presale coins without leaving the app. Visit Best Wallet Presale Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Czecker shared the “big personal news” in a post on X , revealing that his exit as head of growth at the synthetic dollar protocol comes after an incredible journey that has seen the project grow into one of decentralized finance ecosystem’s top platforms. “It has been a truly incredible and rewarding journey,” he wrote. “I joined the protocol around the seed round, drove $1B+ in DeFi partnerships while making sure Ethena is on your mind 24/7 and had incredible fun while doing it.” The outgoing Ethena ( ENA ) team member notes he’s been “actively involved” with the project from zero to a multi-billion dollar success story. The USDe ( USDe ) stablecoin issuer’s total value locked, according to DeFiLlama, currently stands at nearly $6 billion. Much of the rollercoaster growth has come amid huge demand from yield-hungry investors. Read more: Ethena officially launches USDtb, stablecoin backed by BlackRock While he is stepping down from his role at the crypto project, Czecker says his decision is also down to him being “tired.” “The firm is entering a different phase in its growth [but] truth be told, I am also tired of DeFi. I’ve been doing this for years without any real holidays, worked with every major liquidity provider, protocol, KOL in the space and deserve some rest. I’ve done literally everything you could do in DeFi,” he noted. Czecker plans to continue supporting Ethena from outside, and will take a one to two months of deserved break and rest. When he returns to actively participating in the industry, his plan is to avoid “pure DeFi.” Rather, he will look to explore other sectors, including artificial intelligence, memes, SocialFi, entertainment and fashion.

As 2025 approaches, several projects are emerging as short-term winners poised to deliver substantial returns. Among the standout picks are Lightchain AI (LCAI) , Ripple’s XRP, Avalanche (AVAX), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Each of these tokens offers unique advantages that make them compelling options for wealth-building over the next two years. Lightchain AI Rising Star of Blockchain and AI Integration Lightchain AI is emerging as a rising star in the blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) integration space. By seamlessly combining AI with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI creates decentralized applications (dApps) that offer tangible, real-world solutions. This groundbreaking fusion enables industries to adopt blockchain solutions while leveraging the power of AI for enhanced efficiency and accuracy. The platform's innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) set it apart from traditional blockchain projects. Lightchain AI’s unique approach to decentralized governance ensures that users actively contribute to the platform's future, making it a truly community-driven ecosystem. With a clear roadmap and ongoing presale success , Lightchain AI is positioned for growth, providing investors with an exciting opportunity in the blockchain and AI sectors. As the integration of AI and blockchain continues to rise, Lightchain AI stands poised to disrupt industries and revolutionize the space. XRP And Avalanche Two Top Picks for Short-Term Success XRP and Avalanche (AVAX) have recently demonstrated significant potential for short-term gains. XRP, the cryptocurrency issued by Ripple Labs, has experienced substantial growth, surging over 300% since the U.S. election. This increase is largely attributed to expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under President-elect Donald Trump, who has appointed pro-crypto individuals to key positions, including Paul Atkins as the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Similarly, Avalanche has shown impressive performance, with its native token, AVAX, increasing in value by 96% over the past month, currently trading around $47.77. This rally is supported by a general bull market and several innovations within the Avalanche ecosystem, such as the launch of a $40 million retroactive grant program aimed at supporting developers building on the Avalanche network. Both XRP and AVAX are well-positioned for short-term success, driven by favorable regulatory developments and ecosystem advancements. Shiba Inu Meme Coin With Expanding Utility Once known solely as a meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has evolved into a multi-faceted ecosystem. Through initiatives like ShibaSwap and the integration of NFTs, SHIB is diversifying its appeal beyond speculative trading. SHIB’s recent efforts to build utility and strengthen its community engagement make it an intriguing short-term pick for investors looking to capitalize on market sentiment while benefiting from its expanding ecosystem. Though still driven by hype, its newfound focus on utility gives it a competitive edge in the crowded meme coin market. As such, SHIB is poised to continue its upward trend and potentially deliver significant returns by 2025. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Tokens such as PEPE and DOGE have shown the potential for significant returns, but as the market evolves, where might the next 100x opportunity be? As investors look for the best cryptocurrency to buy, 1Fuel is quickly emerging as a standout. With its presale gaining traction and the second stage priced at $0.012, the token is emerging as the best new cryptocurrency for forward-thinking investors. Is 1Fuel, with its innovative approach to DeFi solutions, poised to overthrow the reign of meme currencies? Read more to learn about the legacy of PEPE and DOGE, and why 1Fuel could be the next big thing. The Rise And Decline Of PEPE PEPE became a meme coin sensation that transformed little investments into fortunes that changed people’s lives. A combination of trade speculation and internet culture drove its rapid rise, attracting investors everywhere. PEPE recently saw a sharp increase in value, rising 14% when Elon Musk made a reference to the movie “Gladiator” in a meme tweet with PEPE, sparking a renewed interest in the cryptocurrency. However, PEPE hasn’t had a good run lately, as volatility has led to large price corrections. The price of the token dropped by 9.50% last week, per CoinMarketCap data. PEPE is underperforming against Ethereum Ecosystem coins, which are up 12.70%. While some still believe in a resurgence for the coin, others are looking for the best cryptocurrency to buy to ensure a sustained rise. DOGE’s Staying Power Dogecoin (DOGE), the very first meme coin, continues to hold its own relatively in the market. The network operation is mostly community-driven and decentralized; DOGE has attracted partnerships and collaborations with different firms and organizations, targeting Dogecoin’s recognition and integration into current payment systems and platforms. DOGE’s current standing gives it an edge over younger entrants such as PEPE. While DOGE’s growth rate has recently slowed—leaving investors wondering if it can repeat its previous performance—the coin has started to gain momentum with substantial whale buy-ins. DOGE has just moved from -5.2% to $0.31; the trading rate going from -13.49% to $2.69b. 1FUEL: The DeFi Game Changer While meme coins rely heavily on hype, 1Fuel is built on substance . Its presale numbers—rapidly increasing—are a testament to the substance that the new coin offers. 1Fuel stresses user privacy and security while maintaining the wallet’s flexibility and cross-chain functionality. The platform uses Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) to protect transactions, ensuring that they are executed systematically, adding a layer of security that manual cross-chain transactions lack. 1Fuel is positioned as the best cryptocurrency to buy today as its market trajectory shows that it could produce the long-term growth that many meme tokens struggle to attain. Furthermore, its utility-driven tokenomics and vision for decentralized finance make it the best new cryptocurrency for investors looking beyond speculative trends. With its presale momentum rising, 1Fuel is more than just another token but a balanced investment option with long-term potential. Conclusion PEPE and DOGE have generated momentum in the cryptocurrency industry, transforming early adopters into millionaires. However, their overreliance on market trends and community hype raises concerns about their sustainability. For those looking for a well-rounded option, 1Fuel distinguishes itself as the best cryptocurrency to buy today given its emphasis on pragmatic usability and innovation. The platform’s features—including its cryptocurrency wallet and staking programs—make it just the right fit for investors aiming to balance risk, reward and prolonged sustainability.

38315047,https://blockworks.co/news/unpacking-the-ai-agent-meta,1735581600,Making sense of the AI agent meta,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The AI agent frenzy was kickstarted by GOAT. GOAT is a Solana memecoin that spawned from an experiment by creator Andy Ayrey when he pitted two Claude AI models in an endless debate. GOAT still sits today at a comfortable $404 million market cap, but no longer dominates the mindshare it once did. First to copy GOAT’s success was the AI agent Luna (LUNA). It’s a busty anime girl chatbot that streams 24/7 on social media — need I say more? Chat with her, tip her with her own LUNA token (why does anyone do that?), or be like A16z-backed Story Protocol : Hire Luna for social media marketing. The Luna virtual companion was launched on Virtuals Protocol , an “AI Agent launchpad” on Base that is the most recognizable brand name in this meta right now. Formerly the PathDAO gaming guild, Virtuals took pump.fun’s successful formula and applied it to AI agents. Launch an agent token, hit a target market cap on a bonding curve, and pair the agent’s token in a liquidity pool on Uniswap. What Virtuals did differently, however — and what has gotten investor-types bullish on its token — was tying its native VIRTUALS token to the cost of launching agents and running inferences, as well as pairing it with agent tokens in a Uniswap liquidity pair (rather than SOL). Within the Virtuals ecosystem, Luna faces competition for speculative capital from other similarly looking chatbots like Airene , or more “utility-based” agents like aixbt , an agent that scrapes troves of social media data to surface trading alpha (aixbt is incidentally bullish on everything). $AIXBT is now a $1 billion market cap project based on mindshare, and it still wouldn't be overpriced. @aixbt_agent has undeniably become the most influential entity in all crypto right now. From @cookiedotfun to @_kaitoai , the signs are everywhere—this is a movement, not just… https://t.co/G4qAorXSVb pic.twitter.com/rg075ZYPTn — Diamond Hands Dig 👾 💎 (@DiamondHandsDig) December 29, 2024 Just as agents face competition, so too do the picks-and-shovels of agents. Besides Virtuals, a myriad of AI agent launchpads already exist, such as vvaifu.fun, Creator.Bid, MyShell.ai, Zentients and more. Then we have the AI agent “frameworks.” These are simply code libraries that make it easy for devs to customize their agents and integrate them into the virtual Wild West. The leading agent framework is ai16z’s “Eliza,” but there’s also Virtual’s G.A.M.E (Generative Autonomous Multimodal Entities), the Python-based ZerePy, the Solana-focused RIG, and more. And of course, each one of these frameworks has its own token that speculators are furiously aping into. Source: Messari Finally, we have the AI investment DAOs. The idea is simple: Deposit SOL/ETH and receive a DAO token that lets you share in the “hedge fund’s” upside. Ai16z was the first investment DAO to launch on Solana, now with an AUM of $23.4 million. People apparently really trust the investor acumen of AI agents. Presently, its native AI16Z token is valued at an astounding $1.4 billion market cap. Daos.world and VaderAI are two upcoming AI investment platforms on Base that have gained steam in the past week. At least six funds have already emerged on both platforms, with about a collective million in capital raised. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Known for its revolutionary approach to blending artificial intelligence and blockchain, Lightchain AI offers cutting-edge features like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). The ongoing Lightchain AI Presale has fueled excitement, attracting both retail and institutional investors. With a robust roadmap and innovative tokenomics, Lightchain AI is emerging as a top contender for massive growth in the evolving crypto market. The Rise of a New Contender- Understanding the Rival Altcoin Lightchain AI's unique features and technology have attracted the attention of Dogecoin whales, who are known for their ability to spot promising projects in the crypto space. As they quietly accumulate Lightchain AI tokens, many experts predict that this rival altcoin could surpass even Dogecoin in terms of growth potential. So what sets Lightchain AI apart from other altcoins? Here are some key factors contributing to its rising popularity. Lightchain AI's rising popularity is driven by its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus, combining blockchain security with AI efficiency. Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) fosters seamless AI model integration, attracting developers and enterprises. Competitive tokenomics and a strong presale performance highlight investor confidence. Additionally, Lightchain's transparent roadmap, robust governance model, and vision to revolutionize AI-driven decentralized applications have solidified its appeal in the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem. Whale Accumulation Trends- Strategic Moves Behind the Scenes Whale accumulation trends significantly influence cryptocurrency markets, as large holders, known as whales, execute strategic trades that can sway asset prices. These investors often accumulate cryptocurrencies during market consolidations, purchasing substantial amounts without causing immediate price surges. This methodical accumulation can indicate a bullish outlook, as whales anticipate future price increases. Conversely, when whales distribute or sell off their holdings, it can lead to price declines, impacting market sentiment. Monitoring whale activities provides valuable insights into potential market movements, enabling traders to make informed decisions. However, it's essential to recognize that whales may also engage in market manipulation tactics, such as pump-and-dump schemes, which can mislead less experienced investors. Lightchain AI's rising popularity among Dogecoin whales could indicate their confidence in its potential for growth, making it a promising investment opportunity worth considering.

38314608,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314570,1735581352,Blockchain Association Files Suit To Challenge IRS and Treasury Department’s DeFi Broker ‘Midnight’ Rulemaking,"A prominent nonprofit crypto advocacy group is filing a lawsuit to dispute new reporting rules for decentralized finance (DeFi) brokers. In a new press release, the Blockchain Association says the “midnight” decision by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Treasury Department to force DeFi protocols to follow the same reporting rules as securities brokers would “cripple” the US digital assets industry and impose unlawful compliance regulations on developers. Last week, the Treasury Department issued a press release about a new rule that requires DeFi brokers to report on the gross proceeds of sales of their digital assets. As stated by Marisa Coppel, head of legal at the firm, “The IRS and Treasury have gone beyond their statutory authority in expanding the definition of ‘broker’ to include providers of DeFi trading front-ends even though they do not effectuate transactions. Not only is this an infringement on the privacy rights of individuals using decentralized technology, it would push this entire, burgeoning technology offshore. Blockchain Association continues to stand with the innovators and users of DeFi, and will continue to fight this misguided rulemaking to ensure the United States remains a home for decentralized finance technology and developers alike.” In a recent thread on the social media platform X, Kristin Smith, the chief executive of the Blockchain Association, says the new rules are unconstitutional. “Today we’re taking action, filing a lawsuit that argues today’s broker rulemaking violates the Administrative Procedure Act and is unconstitutional. We stand with our nation’s innovators and will continue working to ensure the future of crypto – and DeFi – is here in the United States.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This innovative project is gaining traction with its unique integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain. With predictions of a 29,203% surge, the Lightchain AI Presale has become a hotspot for investors seeking explosive returns. Its ambitious roadmap positions it as a disruptive force in the evolving crypto landscape. Lightchain AI- A Rising Star in the Altcoin Space Lightchain AI is an emerging cryptocurrency that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology to enhance decentralized applications and governance. Its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, promoting meaningful contributions to AI development while maintaining network security. At the core of its ecosystem is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a computational layer designed to execute AI-specific tasks seamlessly on the blockchain. This combination positions Lightchain AI as a promising player in the altcoin market, offering real-world applications across various industries. Cardano's Struggle with the $1.4 Resistance Level Cardano (ADA) has recently encountered significant resistance around the $1.4 price level, hindering its upward momentum. Analysts have identified this threshold as a critical barrier, with potential targets at $1.4, $1.6, and $1.8, contingent upon ADA's ability to surpass this resistance. Despite a 6% weekly increase, ADA's price has struggled to maintain levels above $1.4, indicating persistent selling pressure. Technical indicators suggest that overcoming the $1.4 resistance could pave the way for further gains; however, failure to do so may result in a consolidation or potential decline. Investors are advised to monitor ADA's price action closely, as a decisive move above this level could signal renewed bullish momentum, while continued resistance may indicate the need for caution. Potential for a 29,203% Surge: What's Driving Lightchain AI's Growth? Lightchain AI’s meteoric rise is fueled by its groundbreaking innovations in blockchain and artificial intelligence.

38316039,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323338,1735581144,Fartcoin’s Insane Growth Turns Early Backers Into Millionaires,"Fartcoin has declined by 12.5% today, with the Solana-based meme coin dropping to $0.8254 as the crypto market slips by 3% in the past 24 hours. Despite its losses, FARTCOIN’s recent momentum means it’s still up by 22% in the past week and by 183% in the past month, making it one of the best meme coins to buy at the moment. Its growth has enabled it to jump up to 134th in the market’s rankings by capitalization, and in the process it has made millions in profits for some of its earlier buyers. And while there’s debate about just how far it can continue growing, its technicals alone suggest that it may rebound very soon from its recent dives. Fartcoin’s Insane Growth Turns Early Backers Into Millionaires Fartcoin has been the fourth best-performing coin in the top-200 over the past 30 days (behind ai16z, Bitget Token and Hyperliquid), with its rise making big profits for certain early movers. According to Lookonchain, one whale made a quick profit of around $2.5 million this month , after trading 12,160 SOL for 8.15 million FARTCOIN. A whale is selling $CHILLGUY to buy $Fartcoin. #CHILLGUY #Fartcoin The whale spent 2,025 $SOL to buy 5.73M $CHILLGUY and sold for 9,963 $SOL , making 7,938 $SOL ($1.79M). In the past 21 days, the whale has spent 12,160 $SOL ($2.75M) to buy 8.15M $Fartcoin($5.28M currently), with… pic.twitter.com/UE0bevACCg — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 13, 2024 This whale has since sold their holdings, which perhaps helps explain why FARTCOIN has plummeted by 36% since reaching an all-time high of $1.29 on December 20. Some whales do still hold onto significant quantities of the meme coin , suggesting that there remains belief that the coin will rebound sooner or later. Yet analysts are split on whether FARTCOIN has already had its moment in the Sun, with some claiming that it has begun a “ silent but deadly decline. “ Others, however, are more bullish, expecting the coin to exceed its current record high in the first quarter of 2025. #fartcoin pic.twitter.com/QBUu5jGrGK — KNIGHT $INJ TO 100$ (@cryptoknight890) December 29, 2024 And looking at its chart today, its indicators suggest that a recovery could be coming soon. Its relative strength index (purple) bottomed out last night after dropping to 30, rising to 50 earlier this morning. Likewise, its 30-period moving average (orange) may be close to bottoming out in relation to the 200-period (blue). Source: TradingView Yet it is concerning that it has been trading within an increasingly lower channel over the past week or so, a sign that the naysayers may be correct in claiming that the token has already begun its decline. It’s also disconcerting that its trading volume has subsided to about $80 million in the past few days, down from $350 million barely a week ago. Based on this, FARTCOIN may struggle to return to $1 in the near future, with $0.85 perhaps the best it can manage for the New Year. New Meme Tokens with Strong Fundamentals Assuming that FARTCOIN may have already peaked, traders may therefore want to turn to next thing already. Of course, identifying the next viral meme token is usually a very fraught and unpredictable business, yet a new project is aiming to reduce some of the risk. It’s called Meme Index (MEMEX) , and as its name suggests, its platform will operate decentralized indexes that will track various baskets of meme coins. It launched its presale earlier this month, but has already gone on to raise $1.15 million from bullish investors. Meme Index is live in Upcoming Tokens! @memecoin_index presents the first-ever diversified meme coin platform, powered by $MEMEX , giving unparalleled access to the $120 billion meme coin market. Meme Index offers exclusive access to indexes that cater to every risk… pic.twitter.com/GsiBBuZOzX — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) December 27, 2024 Meme Index works by enabling holders of MEMEX to invest in one of four decentralized meme token indexes. These indexes will track different kinds of meme coins with different risk profiles, with the Titan index tracking established tokens such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe. There are also MidCap, Moonshot and Frenzy indexes, with the latter covering the most volatile tokens in the market. Together, such indexes give investors the chance to spread their risk across multiple coins, something which in the longer term may help them make bigger profits. Given that meme tokens have been one of the biggest stories of 2024, Meme Index could attract thousands of investors looking to get involved in the space without taking on too much risk. As its native token, MEMEX will be open to staking and it will also confer governance rights, with holders able to vote on new indexes. Investors interested in joining Meme Index’s presale can do so by going to its official website, where MEMEX is currently selling at $0.0147457. This sale price will rise in just under a day and will continue to rise for the duration of the offering, so buyers should move quickly.

The list highlights cryptocurrencies the company believes demonstrate strong potential for the upcoming quarter. The Six Tokens According to the December 30 report , this update emphasizes tokens linked to three primary market themes: the U.S. election and its potential regulatory implications for decentralized finance (DeFi) and staking, breakthroughs in decentralized AI technologies and blockchain adoption by AI agents, and the growth of the Solana ecosystem. Based on these factors, Grayscale has added Hyperliquid (HYPE), Ethena (ENA), Virtual Protocol (VIRTUAL), Jupiter (JUP), Jito (JTO), and Grass (GRASS) to its Top 20 list. Hyperliquid, a Layer 1 blockchain, powers financial applications and operates a decentralized exchange for perpetual futures with a fully on-chain order book. On the other hand, Ethena introduced USDe, a stablecoin backed by hedged positions in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), offering staking opportunities tied to price differences between spot and futures markets. Virtual Protocol enables the creation of tokenized AI agents on Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 network. This functionality allows agents to interact autonomously with their surroundings and users. Jupiter, the leading decentralized exchange aggregator on Solana, has the highest total value locked (TVL) of any application on the network. Another Solana project, Jito, is a liquid staking protocol that generated over $550 million in fee revenue in 2024. The last of the six, Grass, operates as a decentralized data-sharing platform. It compensates users for sharing unused internet bandwidth via a Chrome extension. This bandwidth is then sold to AI developers for training machine learning models, offering a unique approach to monetizing data. In addition to these new entries, Grayscale rotated out some tokens, including Celo (CELO), from the Top 20. While these removed tokens remain relevant to the broader crypto ecosystem, the company explained that the updated selection better reflects the risk-adjusted returns expected for the upcoming quarter. Smart Contract Platforms Grayscale’s latest report also highlighted the intensifying competition among smart contract platforms. Despite major wins in the final quarter of 2024, Ethereum faces growing pressure from competitors like Solana and The Open Network. The research explains that these platforms are gaining traction by addressing the ‘blockchain trilemma,’ balancing scalability, security, and decentralization with innovative solutions. Fee revenue also continues to play a critical role in driving the value of smart contract platform tokens. For that reason, Grayscale included Ethereum, Solana, Sui, and Optimism in its top 20 list for Q1 2025 as standout smart contract platforms. According to the asset manager, these projects can generate sustainable fee revenues while delivering long-term value to their ecosystems.

38314837,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=635000,1735580952,"FTX creditor denounces $16B distribution rumor, says it’s only $7.5B","FTX creditors are furious again. This time, it’s about a wild rumor claiming the bankrupt crypto exchange will distribute $16 billion in cash within 60 days starting January 3. Sunil, an FTX creditor, called out AIXBT, accusing them of spreading outright lies. He clarified that FTX doesn’t even have $16 billion available. Let’s clear up the math. FTX has about $13 billion in cash right now and plans to hold back $6.5 billion. That leaves between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion for the first distribution. That’s not pocket change, but it’s far from the dreamland figures being thrown around. Sunil said, “False: Distribution does not start 3rd Jan and $16bn within 60 days.” What FTX actually has to work with FTX collapsed in November 2022. It went from being one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world to the biggest crypto joke. Thanks to Sam Bankman-Fried and his web of mismanagement and fraud, the exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Alameda Research, the trading firm tied to FTX, crumbled right along with it. Now, fast forward to December 2024, and FTX’s financial cleanup is still a mess. As of now, the company has $13 billion in cash. That number might hit $14 billion by March 2025. But here’s the thing: FTX wants to hold on to $6.5 billion of that for disputed claims and other recovery efforts. The bankruptcy team, led by CEO John J. Ray III, has clawed back assets from every corner of the crypto world. Venture capital portfolios, lawsuits, and other liquidated holdings are expected to add another $5 billion to $7 billion. First payouts and the timeline you can actually believe FTX’s Chapter 11 reorganization plan goes live on January 3. After that, the first distributions are expected within 60 days. The company’s priority is smaller creditors, those owed $50,000 or less. But the total amount available for that initial payout sits around $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion. Sunil explained the timeline in no uncertain terms. He said the first $7 billion would be distributed by March 25, 2025. The rest? That’s tied up in disputed claims. FTX has set aside 50% of these claims—about $7 billion—for a reserve. This money won’t go anywhere until all the disputes are resolved. If history is any guide, that could take years. To handle the chaos, FTX is leaning on BitGo and Kraken to manage the payouts. These companies have been tapped to make sure creditors get what they’re owed. And it’s no small task, considering the sheer number of claims they’re dealing with. FTT token rockets while creditors wait While creditors are busy sorting through what they’ll actually get, the market is having a field day. The FTX Token (FTT), which was nearly worthless just a few months ago, has surged. As of press time, it’s trading at $3.50. That’s a 245% jump since September, pushing its market cap over $1.1 billion. Optimism around the payouts is driving the FTT rally. FTX’s recovery plan aims to repay creditors up to 119% of their claims. For smaller investors, that’s a big deal. If you were owed $10,000, for instance, you might end up with $11,900.

This emerging altcoin is gaining traction for its innovative approach to merging blockchain and artificial intelligence, offering scalable and transparent solutions for decentralized applications. With an ambitious roadmap and significant investor interest, Lightchain AI is poised to deliver explosive returns. The ongoing Lightchain AI Presale has become a hotspot for early adopters, signaling a massive potential rally as this altcoin garners market attention. From PNUT to Lightchain AI- A Trader's Strategic Shift in the Crypto Landscape A prominent cryptocurrency trader, known for a swift $3.2 million profit from Solana's PNUT token, is now focusing on Lightchain AI (LCAI). This strategic move highlights LCAI's potential in the evolving crypto landscape. Lightchain AI distinguishes itself by integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, introducing innovations like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). These features enable efficient, decentralized AI computations, offering solutions beyond financial transactions. The ongoing LCAI presale, with tokens priced at $0.0045, has garnered significant investor interest, indicating strong market confidence in its long-term prospects. This early adoption phase presents opportunities for substantial returns, setting LCAI apart from more established cryptocurrencies. Analyzing Lightchain AI- The Next Big Opportunity for High-Stakes Investors Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a significant opportunity for high-stakes investors, seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its innovative approach has attracted interest from venture capitalists, tech enthusiasts and crypto traders alike. Currently in its presale phase, LCAI tokens are priced at $0.0045, presenting an accessible entry point for investors. Analysts project substantial growth, with conservative estimates suggesting a rise to $0.50 by 2025, and more optimistic scenarios predicting values exceeding $1. This potential surge is attributed to Lightchain AI's real-world applications across industries such as healthcare, finance, and supply chain management, positioning it as a compelling choice for investors seeking significant returns in the evolving crypto landscape. Potential Returns- Evaluating Lightchain AI's Growth Prospects Compared to PNUT Lightchain AI (LCAI) is attracting significant attention in the cryptocurrency market due to its innovative integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Analysts project that LCAI, currently priced at $0.0045 during its presale, could reach $0.50 by 2025, representing a substantial increase. In contrast, Solana's PNUT token experienced a rapid surge, yielding a $3.2 million profit for a trader within 20 minutes. However, such swift gains are often driven by market speculation and may not indicate long-term sustainability. Lightchain AI's growth prospects are underpinned by its real-world applications across various industries, including healthcare, finance, and supply chain management. Its unique features, such as the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), enhance its scalability and efficiency. This technological foundation suggests that LCAI may offer more sustainable and significant returns compared to tokens like PNUT, which may lack similar utility and long-term growth potential. So, while LCAI may not replicate PNUT's swift gains, it presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity. The ongoing presale phase offers an opportunity for investors to enter the market at an early stage before its value potentially surges. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI.

38338444,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/6-hot-meme-coins-to-watch-in-january-for-massive-roi-potential,1735580214,6 Hot Meme Coins to Watch in January for Massive ROI Potential,"Meme coins continue to be a major draw for investors seeking exponential returns in the cryptocurrency market. With their mix of humor, community support, and speculative opportunities, they offer unique appeal. Among the hottest meme coins this January are Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Dogwifhat (WIF), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and the innovative Lightchain AI (LCAI) . Here’s why these coins are catching the attention of crypto enthusiasts this month. Classics Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have firmly established themselves as the top meme-based cryptocurrencies, each with impressive market caps and passionate communities. Dogecoin, created back in 2013 as a fun alternative to Bitcoin, has seen its fair share of price ups and downs, often driven by endorsements from big names like Elon Musk. On the other hand, Shiba Inu, launched in 2020, has built an entire ecosystem, including the Shibarium layer-2 network, which now handles over 2 million transactions daily. Both tokens have proven their ability to adapt and stay strong in the ever-changing crypto world. Recently, Dogecoin saw a nearly 20% jump in value after Elon Musk announced the ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE), showing just how much news and social media can impact its price. Shiba Inu has also been busy, with its burn rate soaring by 208.5% and 53.4 million tokens burned in one transaction—a sign of ongoing efforts to reduce supply and potentially boost value. While these tokens have shown resilience, it’s important to remember that the crypto market can be unpredictable. Always approach with caution and keep an eye on market trends! Emerging Favorites PEPE, Dogwifhat (WIF), and Floki Inu (FLOKI) In the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, meme coins such as PEPE, Dogwifhat (WIF), and Floki Inu (FLOKI) have gained significant attention due to their substantial price fluctuations and dedicated community support. PEPE, inspired by the Pepe the Frog internet meme, has exhibited notable volatility, with its value largely driven by market speculation and investor sentiment. Similarly, WIF, featuring a Shiba Inu in a knitted beanie, has recorded impressive gains, outpacing major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin during the first half of 2024. FLOKI, named after Elon Musk's Shiba Inu dog, has also experienced remarkable growth, with its value surging by 418% in the same period. The rapid rise of these meme coins can be attributed to their viral appeal and the strong communities backing them. However, their inherent volatility requires careful assessment and cautious consideration from prospective investors. Game-Changer Lightchain AI (LCAI) Lightchain AI is transforming the crypto space by blending the power of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to redefine decentralized applications and governance. Imagine a world where creators and developers can bring their ideas to life and monetize them in a secure, AI-powered ecosystem—this is exactly what the Memecoin Launchpad offers, unlocking boundless creativity. At the heart of Lightchain AI is the groundbreaking Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), built to handle complex AI tasks like model training and inference directly on the blockchain. Its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism not only secures the network but also rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, creating a dynamic and rewarding system. But that's not all. With cutting-edge scalability through sharding and Layer 2 solutions, Lightchain AI ensures lightning-fast, efficient processing, making sure it can keep up with growing demands. On top of that, advanced privacy tools like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Homomorphic Encryption safeguard user data while enabling secure computations. Lightchain AI isn't just keeping up with the future—it's shaping it. This is the next leap forward in the crypto and AI revolution.

As SHIB’s momentum slows, attention is shifting toward emerging altcoins that combine innovation with real-world applications. One standout contender is Lightchain AI, a SHIB rival that is quickly gaining traction for its groundbreaking integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain. With its token priced at just $0.004 during presale , Lightchain AI has the potential to deliver massive returns within months, thanks to its transformative technology and growing investor interest. Analysts predict Lightchain AI could achieve exponential growth as it addresses real-world challenges in industries like healthcare and logistics. As the market pivots toward utility-driven projects, Lightchain AI is positioned to outpace speculative tokens like SHIB, offering a unique opportunity for savvy investors. Rise of Utility-Driven Altcoins The cryptocurrency landscape is undergoing a shift as investors increasingly prioritize utility-driven altcoins over speculative tokens. Projects that offer real-world applications and innovative technology are rising to the forefront, capturing attention from seasoned and new investors alike. Lightchain AI, a prominent SHIB altcoin rival, exemplifies this trend with its unique integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain. By addressing practical challenges in industries like logistics, finance, and healthcare, Lightchain AI is reshaping expectations of what cryptocurrencies can achieve. Unlike meme-based tokens that rely heavily on hype, utility-focused projects like Lightchain AI bring tangible value and sustainability. As the market matures, investors are moving toward platforms that promise scalability, innovation, and long-term growth. With Lightchain AI’s presale gaining momentum, it highlights the growing demand for altcoins that deliver beyond speculative gains, paving the way for a new era in crypto investment. Shiba Inu’s 1000x Rally to $1 A Distant Dream The prospect of Shiba Inu (SHIB) achieving a 1000x rally to $1 by 2025 appears increasingly unlikely. While SHIB has enjoyed significant success as a meme-based cryptocurrency, its reliance on speculative hype and limited real-world utility have curbed its long-term growth potential. The sheer scale of market capitalization required to support such a price increase would place SHIB well beyond the combined value of major global assets, making the goal unrealistic. Furthermore, the shifting crypto landscape favors utility-driven projects over speculative tokens, further diminishing SHIB’s chances of reaching such heights. As investors pivot toward platforms with tangible value and transformative technology, emerging rivals like Lightchain AI are stealing the spotlight. By offering real-world applications and innovation, these competitors highlight the challenges SHIB faces in sustaining its hype and achieving its lofty price ambitions. How Lightchain AI Could Do What SHIB Can’t Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a transformative force in the crypto market, capable of achieving what Shiba Inu (SHIB) likely cannot—a realistic pathway to exponential growth driven by innovation and utility. While SHIB's reliance on meme culture and community support has brought it into the spotlight, its limited real-world use cases restrict its potential for sustainable expansion. In contrast, Lightchain AI integrates cutting-edge artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, solving real-world challenges in industries like logistics, healthcare, and finance. Its standout feature, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), allows for seamless execution of AI tasks within a decentralized network, providing unmatched scalability and efficiency. Coupled with its robust roadmap and presale buzz, Lightchain AI offers tangible value to investors. By focusing on utility rather than hype, Lightchain AI demonstrates its potential to achieve massive gains that SHIB cannot realistically replicate. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Bitdeer stands out with its all-in-one Bitcoin mining model, including self-hosting, cloud mining, ASIC hardware, and hosting services, ensuring year-round revenue. The company is expanding its capacity, targeting 2540 MW by 2026, with significant projects in Norway, Ohio, and Bhutan, aligning with its HPC and AI diversification. Despite high R&D costs, Bitdeer maintains strong short-term liquidity and is poised for revenue growth with the commercial rollout of SEALMINER machines in 2025. Bitdeer ( BTDR) has shown impressive performance in this Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) market cycle, being one of the new entrants into the publicly traded Bitcoin miner list, having made its market debut just last year. BTDR is up 233% since I last covered it in June with a “buy” rating. My “buy” rating in June was buoyed by the company's vertical integration strategy through the development of its proprietary ASIC mining hardware, known as the SEALMINER. Its steady capacity expansion, and the company's diversification into HPC and AI hosting. Miners' stock price Dec 4 to December 27 (Seeking Alpha) Among the Bitcoin miners, Bitdeer has recently shown a type of momentum that isn't a fluke. Since Bitcoin hit the very important $100,000 psychological level on December 4, Bitdeer has led the gains among publicly traded Bitcoin miners - a stark opposite of when I covered it in June at a time it lagged in YTD gains among miners. Bitdeer is up 47% since Bitcoin crossed that key milestone for the first time. BTDR has defied the Bitcoin-driven volatility that other Bitcoin stocks have been experiencing. Mining peers like Mara Holdings ( MARA ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), Hut 8 Corp. ( HUT ), Core Scientific ( CORZ ), IREN Limited ( IREN ), and CleanSpark ( CLSK ) have all recorded negative returns (see the chart above) since Bitcoin decreased from the $100k mark, now trading around $93,000; however, BTDR remains defiant. BTDR is exhibiting the characteristics of a strong growth stock, going to 2025. Strengths for Bitdeer Going Into 2025 The crypto community anticipates 2025 to be a transformative year for Bitcoin and crypto in general. The newly elected U.S. President, if true to campaign promises, will be creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. And the creation of this reserve is a main catalyst that most Bitcoin investors are hoping for, as this will give Bitcoin more legitimacy and increase demand for the asset. If this happens, the positive effect on well-positioned Bitcoin-linked businesses will be enormous. And how well is Bitdeer positioned going into 2025 to leverage Bitcoin bull market momentum? Here are some factors I’d consider. Bitdeer- The Most Diversified Bitcoin Miner Bitdeer continues to stand out among the miners today both in its operations model and its price chart. As of today, Bitdeer is one of the few miners that can be considered an “all-in-one” provider of Bitcoin mining products and services. Bitdeer has a foothold across all the Bitcoin mining business models - self-hosting, cloud mining, hosting services, ASIC hardware manufacture and sales, and is also diversifying into HPC and AI. This level of diversification will create an all-year-round sales improvement for Bitdeer in 2025. When hosting services demand is low, those resources can be migrated for use in self-hosting. When Bitcoin price takes a dip, revenue from HPC (if it eventually kicks off fully in 2025) could help offset that from mining. The propriety hardware Bitdeer has been building will also be available for commercial sale, opening new stream for revenue for the miner. Expanding Capacity Bitdeer seems ready for all aspects of mining and hosting business, with 895 MW total capacity currently and a target of 2540 MW capacity by 2026. An additional 1,100 MW of power capacity is expected to go online in 2025. The company is advancing the construction of a 175 MW data center in Norway, with approximately 40 MW expected to be operational by the end of 2024. A 221 MW data center is under development in Ohio, with construction anticipated to be completed in 2025. A 500 MW data center project commenced in March this year in Bhutan, with completion expected in mid-2025. The expansion aligns with the company's diversification into HPC and AI. The 1,100 MW of electricity going online in 2025 will accelerate Bitdeer’s hashrate capacity expansion as well as the HPC service. Bitdeer is looking to achieve over 40 EH/s hashrate under management capacity in 2025 with its proprietary SEALMINER machines. Based on the company's latest reports , the SEALMINER A1 is at the mass production stage and commercial sales of the A2 machines will kick off in Q1 next year. 3.7 EH/s of the A1 machines were being mass-produced as of the end of Q3. 0.1 EH/s of the A1 machines is already energized and 0.4 EH/s delivered for installation, as of the end of Q3. Bitdeer's energy capacity expansion and self-mining expansion are progressing on the same timeline. Having both the power capacity and self-mining hashrate deployed at the same timeline means that the new mining machines will be immediately operational once deployed, helping Bitdeer achieve better efficiency. New Sales Pipeline and Solid Short-Term Liquidity Despite weak financials in the most recent quarter (Q3 2024), Bitdeer has managed its balance sheet prudently. In Q3, Bitdeer saw very poor margins. Gross profit was a mere $2.8 million of the $62 million reported revenue - which represented a 4.5% gross margin. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $8.5 million. The financials were hampered by high operating expenses which mainly consisted of R&D costs. The high operating expenses in Q3 were due to R&D costs of $24.8 million related to the one-off development expense of the SEAL02 chip and amortization expense of intangible assets related to acquisition of ASIC design firm Freechain Inc. Bitdeer has managed to keep its short-term liquidity position on its balance sheet attractive, despite the high R&D costs and the effects that the Bitcoin halving has had on its business. Bitdeer still maintains a positive equity position of $520.7 million in the short term, and $291.3 million in cash and 430 Bitcoin held. Data by YCharts Bitdeer’s R&D expenses have truly been on the high side in 2024. But now that the commercial roll-out of the SEALMINER machines and chips is drawing near, there should be an increase in revenue generation and better margins once the machines hit the market. Sales from these machines should be able to offset future operating expenses related to the mining machines production. Demand for the Bitdeer miners is taking an uptrend even before they officially hit the market. As of the end of Q3, around 7 Eh/s of the 35 Eh/s SEALMINER A2s under production for commercial sale have already been reserved by customers. 7 Eh/s represents around 30,000 mining units. While many of our peers have pursued a self-mining hash rate growth strategy, we pursued a more long-term strategy of first focusing resources on the development of our own ASIC technology. We believe this significantly differentiates our business from the rest of the sector in terms of our strategic positioning, revenue and cost structure. Q3 earnings call Risks While Bitdeer's short-term liquidity position looks good, last month Bitdeer added leverage to its long-term liquidity position by issuing $360 million in convertible notes bearing an annual interest rate of $5.25%. Though this strengthens Bitdeer's ability to fund expansion and growth initiatives, this new debt has increased Bitdeer's financial risk because the crypto market remains volatile, and overnight events that can turn the market highly bearish should not be ruled out. Any time a miner takes on debt, it presents fresh risks. Takeaway SEALMINER Roadmap (Bitdeer) Bitdeer has followed through with the SEALMINER roadmap. And the company's entry into the ASIC market, currently valued at around $10 billion, will change the financial and market standing of Bitdeer in 2025. BTDR is a Bitcoin mining stock to watch out for in 2025. Verified Market Research Bitdeer is entering into the ASIC equipment manufacturing sector with mining machines that will go head-to-head with those of the leading players in the space. Bitdeer’s SEALMINER A2 machines, utilizing the more efficient SEAL02 chips, have undergone testing. The tests conducted in October showed the SEALMINER A2 achieved 226 th/s and an efficiency of 16.5 joules per terahash. The stat is impressive and is on par with what is obtainable from the most popular miners currently in the market, from manufacturers like Bitmain and Canaan.

Shiba Inu, introduced in August 2020 and called the Dogecoin killer, is built on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token. It has expanded its ecosystem with ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling solution, boosting its utility and appeal. Its market cap stands at roughly $10.2 billion as of November 2024. Both cryptocurrencies experience significant price volatility, often driven by social media trends and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Their active communities continue to work on expanding ecosystems and use cases. However, potential investors should be cautious, as these assets carry substantial financial risks.

Launched in April 2023, PEPE is inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme and aims to follow in the footsteps of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Despite having no intrinsic utility, PEPE has built a loyal community and reached a market cap of $7.7 billion as of December 2024. Floki Inu, introduced in 2021, is inspired by Elon Musk's Shiba Inu dog, Floki. While it started as a meme coin, FLOKI has grown into an ecosystem with DeFi tools, NFTs, and a play-to-earn metaverse, boosting its utility and attracting more users. Its market cap stands at $1.68 billion as of December 2024. Both coins highlight the impact of internet culture on crypto, drawing investors through strong communities and social media.

With its Stage 10 presale price of $0.0045 and over $6.28 million raised, Lightchain AI has caught the attention of SOL and LINK traders seeking diversification. Analysts predict LCAI could rise by 11,090% by 2025, offering a compelling opportunity driven by its AI-powered blockchain infrastructure and rapid adoption. What Attracts Solana and Chainlink Traders to Lightchain AI Traders of SOL and LINK are turning their attention to Lightchain AI , drawn by its unique positioning and immense growth potential. While Solana is renowned for its high-speed blockchain solutions and Chainlink is a leader in providing essential oracles, Lightchain AI offers a fresh perspective on scalability by focusing on AI-specific workloads. Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) is designed to efficiently process AI computations, enabling a decentralized platform tailored for AI-driven solutions. Lightchain AI also goes beyond the current use cases of Solana’s dApps and Chainlink’s oracles by targeting industries that have been slower to adopt blockchain technology, such as healthcare diagnostics and supply chain optimization. This broader industry reach has captured the interest of traders seeking diversification and opportunities beyond the existing blockchain market niches. Features That Set Lightchain AI Apart Lightchain AI leverages dynamic resource allocation to optimize computational power based on the complexity of tasks, ensuring consistent performance even in high-demand industries like logistics and real-time analytics. This innovative approach allows the network to handle intensive workloads without any degradation in efficiency. Additionally, Lightchain AI is driving cross-industry integration by partnering with enterprises across various sectors. These collaborations enable seamless adoption of blockchain-based AI solutions, boosting the platform’s scalability and sustainability while setting it apart from tokens confined to specific markets. Furthermore, LCAI places a strong focus on privacy-preserving AI computations, ensuring compliance with global data protection regulations. This advanced privacy framework addresses security concerns, making it a reliable and attractive choice for enterprises considering blockchain adoption. How Lightchain AI Promises 11,090% Returns Lightchain AI’s meteoric rise is being driven by a blend of innovation, market demand, and a solid roadmap. Its strategic partnerships with AI developers and enterprise clients are accelerating adoption and enhancing the token’s long-term growth potential. At the core of its technology is a unique AI-specific consensus mechanism called Proof of Intelligence (PoI), which rewards nodes for performing meaningful AI computations rather than relying on traditional mining models. This not only ensures network security but also boosts usability, driving sustained demand for the token. Additionally, its presale accessibility, priced at just $0.0045, offers investors an opportunity to accumulate substantial holdings with minimal risk. This low entry point amplifies the potential for high returns as the token’s value increases. Together, these factors make Lightchain AI a promising investment, with analysts predicting it could outperform many established tokens in the years to come. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

According to Arkham monitoring data, Tether now holds 82,983 BTC worth $7.68 billion at current prices. The reserves were reportedly accumulated for $2.99 billion at an average price of approximately $36,125 per Bitcoin. This is the third instance this year where Tether has added to its Bitcoin holdings. Blockchain data reveals that in early 2024, the stablecoin issuer acquired 8,888 BTC, valued at $379 million, bringing its reserves to 66,465 BTC. The addition followed Tether’s announcement in May 2023 that it would use profits to purchase Bitcoin for its reserves and explore Bitcoin mining ventures. Tether continues Bitcoin accumulation as USDT supply declines In April 2024, Tether purchased another 8,888 BTC for $600 million, increasing its holdings to over 75,000 BTC at the time. This acquisition positioned Tether as the seventh-largest Bitcoin holder globally, an update uncovered through on-chain data rather than an official disclosure from the company. Tether bought another $650 million worth of BTC in Q1. They now own $5 billion in #Bitcoin 🤯 pic.twitter.com/22vc5dhelg — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) May 4, 2024 Tether had vowed to allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits toward purchasing Bitcoin starting this month. “ Bitcoin has consistently demonstrated its resilience, establishing itself as a long-term store of value with significant growth potential ,” said Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s Chief Technology Officer. He highlighted Bitcoin’s limited supply, decentralized framework, and increasing adoption as enough reasons for the largest crypto by market cap to attract institutional investors. While Tether continues to expand its Bitcoin reserves, its USDT stablecoin has experienced a sharp contraction. According to Coinmarketcap data, USDT’s circulating supply has dropped by more than $1.1 billion in the last seven days. Tether circulating supply drop in the last seven days | Source: Coinmarketcap. The drop could have been sparked by Tether’s hesitance to collaborate with Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) regulations. MiCA has directed exchanges to delist the stablecoin by the end of the year if Tether does not comply with the agency’s rules. As the most widely used stablecoin, USDT plays a critical role in providing liquidity across cryptocurrency markets. The reduced supply has diminished liquidity for Bitcoin transactions, causing a decrease in buying pressure. Bitcoin’s price has been hovering around $92,000, with trading volumes on the decline. Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has fallen to 44.78, and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV), now at 90K, point to bearish sentiments and reduced market participation. European stablecoin market grows following regulatory clarity In Europe, the stablecoin landscape is evolving and fueled by regulatory clarity from MiCA. Tether’s decision to discontinue its EURt stablecoin has created opportunities for new entrants. Societe Generale’s SG-Forge recently launched its Euro-backed stablecoin for retail investors, while financial institutions like Oddo BHF SCA, Revolut, and BBVA are exploring similar initiatives. Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-Forge, confirmed that discussions are underway with multiple banks about partnerships and white-labeling technology for stablecoin issuance. Despite the heavy regulatory requirements, Stenger expressed confidence that more banks would enter the space. Major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, are simultaneously exploring deposit tokens. These tokens are tied to bank accounts but differ from stablecoins in that they often cannot be transferred across institutions. JPMorgan’s Kinexys unit predicts that interest in bank-issued stablecoins will accelerate in the next three years, driven by customer demand and profitability prospects. However, not all financial institutions are eager to enter the stablecoin market. Xapo Bank in Gibraltar, for instance, has chosen not to issue its own stablecoin, citing Tether’s dominance. Instead, the bank aims to integrate blockchain efficiency with traditional banking security, allowing customers to deposit stablecoins into savings accounts without competing directly in the issuance space. “ We don’t want to be in that space, we want to be the tool that allows the efficiency of the blockchain network to interact with the legacy, security of your bank account ,” Joey Garcia, Xapo Bank’s chief legal officer, remarked.

Priced at just $0.0045 during its presale and having raised over $6.28 million, Lightchain AI is drawing comparisons to some of the most iconic growth stories in crypto history. With its innovative blend of artificial intelligence and blockchain, the token is positioned to rival established players like XRP while offering investors a rare opportunity for exponential returns. Cardano’s 2017 ATH Gains: A Benchmark for Crypto Success Cardano’s rise to its ATH in 2017 was a defining moment for the cryptocurrency market, delivering returns of over 11,000% to early investors. This remarkable growth was driven by its promise of scalability, interoperability, and a strong focus on academic rigor. Cardano’s success set a benchmark for emerging projects, showcasing how innovation and community support could transform a low-priced token into a market leader. Lightchain AI now finds itself in a similar position, offering groundbreaking solutions and capturing investor attention with its early-stage pricing and strong market momentum. Lightchain AI’s Potential to Replicate Cardano’s Success Lightchain AI seamlessly integrates blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to tackle real-world challenges, emerging as a standout player in the crypto space. Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) supports scalable, decentralized AI-driven applications, offering practical solutions for industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics. Several factors position Lightchain AI to potentially replicate or surpass Cardano’s 2017 gains. Firstly, its presale success has been remarkable, raising over $6.28 million and demonstrating strong investor confidence in its innovative approach. Secondly, unlike many speculative tokens, Lightchain AI focuses on real-world applications, providing AI-powered solutions that appeal to both enterprises and developers. Lastly, the market timing couldn’t be better; as the crypto market regains momentum, Lightchain AI is strategically positioned to take advantage of the next bull run, creating conditions similar to those that drove Cardano’s explosive growth. XRP vs. Lightchain AI Battle for Blockchain Supremacy While XRP has long been a dominant force in cross-border payments, Lightchain AI is emerging as a rival with a broader scope of applications. XRP’s reliance on institutional partnerships and financial use cases contrasts with Lightchain AI’s versatility in addressing challenges across multiple sectors. Lightchain AI’s ability to combine utility with scalability sets it apart, offering investors a more diversified opportunity for growth. Analysts predict that its innovative approach and early-stage entry price could drive returns comparable to Cardano’s historic rise, making it a compelling alternative for those seeking high-growth potential in the cryptocurrency market. Plus, with its AI-driven technology and focus on real-world solutions, Lightchain AI has the potential to establish itself as a powerful player in the blockchain industry. As it continues to build partnerships and expand its reach, we could see Lightchain AI become a leading contender for blockchain supremacy alongside established players like XRP. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Seven leading crypto executives weigh in on what lies ahead, from the DeFi resurgence to regulatory changes and emerging markets adoption. Michael Harvey, head of franchise trading at Galaxy Digital, predicts that decentralized finance (DeFi) will experience a major revival. After explosive growth in 2020 and subsequent dormancy, DeFi is now gaining traction with improved regulations and user experiences. Next-gen protocols like Spark and Ethena are also on the way, as are key players like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound. Harvey noted Solana’s growing dominance, noting that decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes frequently exceed Ethereum’s. Bitcoin is also joining the DeFi wave, and efforts are underway to leverage its security for programmable use cases, including Ordinals and the expanding BTCFi ecosystem. Amar Kuchinad, global CEO of Copper.co, predicts that 2025 will be a pivotal year for traditional financial institutions experimenting with blockchain. He predicts a rise in fragmented asset baskets such as tokenized government bond funds like BlackRock’s BUIDL. Kuchinad predicts that public blockchains will evolve from real-time consensus layers to periodic clearing systems, while private and hybrid chains will handle day-to-day operations. These changes could lead to faster payments, reduced risk, and increased capital efficiency. With Donald Trump in office, VALR CMO Ben Caselin expects nations to increasingly embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset despite resistance. However, Caselin warns of an impending collapse due to speculative token issuance, likening it to reckless central bank money printing. Related News: Applauded Move from the Largest Bitcoin Mining Pool! $777K Error Compensated! Caselin also sees regional consolidation, with licensed national and continental exchanges leading the way in emerging markets, while unregulated global exchanges could decline. Morgan Krupetsky, head of corporate and capital markets at Ava Labs, predicts a surge in tokenized stocks, fixed income securities and other assets as businesses seek more efficient and transparent financial instruments. He believes regulatory changes like the repeal of SAB 121 could empower banks to adopt public blockchain infrastructure. Krupetsky also predicts that traditional companies will further blur the lines between traditional and digital finance by integrating blockchain technology, particularly in payments and supply chain management. Norris Wang, co-founder of Balance.fun, predicts that the stablecoin market will exceed $250 billion by the end of 2025, which will happen once stablecoins are recognized by regulators as hybrid instruments. Wang expects a balance between strict regulation of onshore stablecoins and pragmatic policies for offshore instruments. Wang also sees DeFi innovation accelerating, deeper integration between DeFi and fintech, and a resurgence of crypto talent in the US, solidifying New York’s role as a global crypto hub. Plume CEO Chris Yin noted the growing intersection of AI and crypto, noting that AI agents are driving new use cases, and he expects real-world assets like tokenized real estate and stablecoins to remain at the center of the crypto space and appeal to institutional adopters.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-the-grinch-trumpgri-solana-memecoin-will-explode-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped 1.8% in the past 24 hours to $91,800, a price not seen since Dec. 5, the day it broke through $100,000  for the first time. The largest cryptocurrency has fallen more than 14% from its Dec. 17 record of $108,278.  Ether (ETH) has lost less, falling 0.7% to $3,320, though it’s now 17% below its December highs, and still has not surpassed the record $4,820 it hit in 2021. Solana (SOL) is also proving a little stronger than bitcoin, with the SOL/BTC ratio up 0.35% today.  The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — is also in the red, sliding 3.74%. Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XRM) have taken the biggest hits, down 6% and 6.3% respectively, while the most resilient coin besides ether has been litecoin (LTC), which is 1.9% lower.  Stocks of crypto-related companies also took a hit. MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Coinbase (COIN) fell 7% and 5.3%, respectively and major bitcoin mining firms like MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) have dropped more than 7%.  The selling pressure is partially caused by investors cashing out after bitcoin shot up more than 117% this year. Profit-taking currently exceeds $1.2 billion on a seven-day moving average, and while that is significantly less than the Dec. 11  peak of $4.0 billion, it’s still much more than usual. Additionally, the lion's share of profits is being taken by investors who have held bitcoin for many years.  Macroeconomics are also weighing on the market, with the U.S. Chicago PMI — which measures the performance of the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sector in the Chicago area — flashing its lowest reading since May, suggesting an economic slowdown is underway.  Uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate policy going into 2025 isn’t helping, since the U.S. central bank has signaled it will pause rate cuts until at least March. The inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, slated for Jan. 20, may also be playing a role. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones are down more than 1%.  ""The market exceeded expectations in 2024, but signs of exhaustion signaled the need for consolidation,"" Joe Carlasare, partner at Amundsen Davis, told CoinDesk. ""Looking ahead to 2025, I’m optimistic but expect the path to diverge from consensus, as markets often do. Bitcoin’s adoption continues to grow, and I anticipate it will generally move in line with traditional markets. If the U.S. avoids a significant growth slowdown, bitcoin should perform well, though the ride may be bumpier than in 2024.""",NEGATIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL,"James Van Straten, Tom Carreras",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/30/bitcoin-drops-to-92-000-as-long-term-holders-keep-taking-profit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/786b23f108963f9aafee38e8d87debdfdc0baa49-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

38313115,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=668103,1735578011,"Dogecoin Price At $5: Analyzing Previous Trends And Why A 1,500% Rally Is Possible","The cryptocurrency market has been running through a period of consolidation over the past seven days, with notable corrections observed in both Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin, after hitting an all-time high of $108,135 on December 17, has seen a retracement towards $93,000. Similarly, Dogecoin has faced pressure, dipping from its recent highs near $0.48 to settle just above $0.30 at the time of writing. According to technical analysis of both cryptocurrencies, an interesting correlation has emerged that points to Dogecoin surging to $5 in the next few months. The 800-Day Trend: A Case For Dogecoin’s Correlation With Bitcoin Bitcoin and Dogecoin have one of the biggest correlations among cryptocurrencies, particularly during market cycle transitions. Bitcoin has always led inflows and outflows into the crypto market, and Dogecoin has historically mirrored its price trends very closely. Related Reading: Doji Formation On Bitcoin Chart Suggests BTC Could See 2 Months Of Upside In The New Year As pointed out by a crypto analyst on social media platform X, these patterns often extend beyond immediate price movements. For example, the number of days between Bitcoin’s cyclical bottoms and Dogecoin’s subsequent peaks has shown a consistent rhythm. Particularly, technical analysis shows that there’s been a consistent pattern of approximately 800 days between Bitcoin’s bottom and Dogecoin’s next major peak. The historical data supporting this theory is compelling. This first time this pattern showed up was in 2017, when the Dogecoin price peaked 868 days after Bitcoin’s bottom of the preceding bear phase in 2015. Again, the 2021 bull rally exhibited this same phenomenon, with Dogecoin peaking at its current all-time high of $0.7316 875 days after Bitcoin’s bottom in 2019. What Lies Ahead For Dogecoin Price? The ongoing market cycle appears to be following a similar trajectory. Bitcoin reached its most recent bottom at $15,422 during the first half of 2023, following a long bear market that saw significant declines across the crypto industry in 2022 and early 2023. Since then, Bitcoin has entered a new bullish phase, gaining momentum in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024. Related Reading: El Salvador Bitcoin Buying Spree Continues, BTC Holdings Now At 6,000 Keeping in mind the 800-day trend, Dogecoin’s next major peak could align with a timeline of approximately 800 days from Bitcoin’s 2023 bottom. This projection places Dogecoin’s potential peak around March or April 2024. In terms of price targets, the analysis provides an optimistic outlook for Dogecoin. Based on historical price performance and the scale of previous rallies, a price of $5 has been identified as a realistic target for Dogecoin around the projected timeline. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.32, down by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. If this trend repeats itself, Dogecoin’s price could soar by 1,460 % from its current levels to new all-time highs. While this seems ultra bullish, it pales in comparison to other predictions of Dogecoin price peaks. Several analysts have speculated that Dogecoin could hit as high as $20 in 2025.

With the leading digital coin's grip loosening, investors are keen to identify potential assets that may surge in value. Market shifts suggest that lesser-known tokens could be on the verge of significant gains as the spotlight moves away from Bitcoin. Analysts are eyeing several promising cryptocurrencies that could benefit from this change in focus within the digital asset space. Transaction volumes for TON, LTC, KAS, and SOL are increasing on ChangeNOW, suggesting investors are accumulating these altcoins. How TON Is Revolutionizing the Crypto Space The Open Network (TON) and its native cryptocurrency, Toncoin, are making waves in the crypto world. Originally developed by Telegram as the Telegram Open Network with the 'Gram' token, the project faced a hurdle in May 2020 due to a court order from the SEC. However, the non-commercial TON Foundation and a passionate community picked up the torch, breathing new life into the project. Toncoin now operates on a proof-of-stake model, boosting the network's scalability and reliability. Aiming to offer fast and secure payment services with minimal fees, TON is building an ecosystem that includes decentralized storage, services, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. In today's market, Toncoin stands out with its strong technology and ambitious goals. Its focus on speed and low fees meets the growing demand for practical blockchain solutions. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, TON's commitment to a complete ecosystem could make it a versatile player in the decentralized arena. As the crypto landscape evolves, projects like TON that offer real-world utility are gaining attention. If you're curious about Toncoin, it can be easily traded on platforms like ChangeNOW without the need for registration or hidden fees. >>> ChangeNOW - Swap Crypto Simple, Fast, Free of Custody Litecoin Shines: The Fast and Friendly Cryptocurrency on the Rise Created in 2011 by former Google engineer Charlie Lee, Litecoin (LTC) was designed to improve upon Bitcoin's shortcomings. With faster transaction times and lower fees, it aims to be the ""silver to Bitcoin's gold."" Litecoin uses a Scrypt hashing algorithm, which makes mining more accessible and less centralized. Blocks are generated every 2.5 minutes, allowing for quicker confirmations. Its larger supply of 84 million coins ensures more availability for everyday transactions and micropayments. In May 2022, Litecoin implemented the MimbleWimble (MWEB) upgrade, enhancing privacy and scalability. This commitment to innovation keeps Litecoin competitive in a crowded crypto market. While it faces stiff competition from Bitcoin and other digital currencies, Litecoin's focus on speed, efficiency, and user-friendliness makes it an attractive option in the current market cycle. For those looking to trade LTC, platforms like ChangeNOW offer an easy way to exchange coins without registration or hidden fees. >>> ChangeNOW - Swap Crypto Simple, Fast, Free of Custody Kaspa Coin: The Lightning-Fast Cryptocurrency Making Waves Kaspa (KAS) is shaking up the crypto world with its promise of blazing-fast transactions. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that can be slow due to how they handle new blocks, Kaspa uses a unique approach. It allows blocks created at the same time to exist together instead of discarding them. This clever method means the network can process more blocks in less time, reducing the wait for transaction confirmations. Currently handling one block per second, Kaspa aims to boost this to ten, and even dreams of one hundred per second. It's all about speed, security, and scalability. In a market where quick transactions are king, Kaspa stands out. Its innovative technology focuses on making crypto faster and more efficient, which could make it an attractive option in today's busy digital currency scene. Compared to other coins that struggle with slow speeds, Kaspa's approach offers a fresh solution. It also includes features that make future improvements and new technologies easier to add. For those looking to dive into this exciting coin, trading KAS is simple. You can swap it on platforms like ChangeNOW without the need to register or worry about hidden fees. >>> ChangeNOW - Swap Crypto Simple, Fast, Free of Custody Solana's SOL: Racing Towards a Faster Blockchain Future Solana is making waves in the crypto world with its focus on speed and scalability. Unlike other platforms like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana aims to handle thousands of transactions per second without the need for sharding or second-layer solutions. Its unique architecture allows developers to create decentralized applications in multiple programming languages, making it flexible and accessible. At the heart of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana's native cryptocurrency, which powers transactions, runs smart programs, and rewards those who support the network. In the current market, SOL stands out due to Solana's high-capacity network that can support busy products and services. As more developers and investors look for scalable blockchain solutions, Solana's technology makes it a strong contender. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, the potential of Solana's ecosystem places SOL in an attractive position compared to some of its rivals. For those interested in exploring SOL, it’s worth noting that it can be traded easily on platforms like ChangeNOW, without the hassle of registration or hidden fees. >>> ChangeNOW - Swap Crypto Simple, Fast, Free of Custody Conclusion TON, LTC, KAS, and SOL each present unique opportunities in the current market as Bitcoin's dominance recedes. TON offers innovative features that could attract attention from investors and traders. LTC, with its long-standing presence and faster transaction speeds, continues to be a reliable option. KAS brings fresh perspectives with its novel approach, potentially appealing to those looking for emerging technologies. SOL, known for its high-performance capabilities, remains a strong contender in the market. For those considering engaging with these cryptocurrencies, ChangeNOW provides a convenient platform to exchange, buy, or sell without hidden fees or registration requirements. With support for over 900 cryptocurrencies, no limits on transaction volumes, and the option to purchase with a bank card, ChangeNOW enhances user experience and security by not storing funds.

SHIB sees a decline in market value Conclusion Top analysts suggest that SHIB and PEPE may have peaked, signaling a shift in market focus toward emerging opportunities. With the PEPE price losing its footing after recent surges, attention is now turning to Remittix, which is forecasted for a potential 5,880% rally. As investors search for the best crypto to buy now, Remittix leads the race as a promising contender in a market shifting toward new growth opportunities. You might also like: Ethereum whales are accumulating Shiba Inu and Remittix – here’s why Remittix: The future of billions in payments In a world that’s rapidly digitizing systems, the way we manage and move money is also evolving.

Remittix capitalizes on this need, blending the power of cryptocurrency with the reliability of fiat systems. By utilizing over 40 cryptocurrencies for conversion to fiat currency, this platform allows users to send money directly to bank accounts across the globe, making international transfers quicker and less expensive.

The PEPE price has been consolidating within a tight range between $0.0000167 and $0.0000195 over the past ten days. Earlier in December 2024, PEPE’s market capitalization surpassed $11 billion, briefly overtaking Uniswap’s token (UNI) in crypto rankings. Technical analysis indicates that PEPE has broken out of a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern, closing a strong daily candle above the pole. Analysts predict that PEPE could reach a price of $0.000025 before 2025, representing a potential increase of approximately 30%. SHIB sees a decline in market value Over the past month, Shiba Inu (SHIB) registered a 15% decline, with its market cap decreasing from $15 billion to $12.8 billion. Despite this downturn, whale investors have accumulated approximately $60 million worth of SHIB in a single day, indicating potential bullish prospects.

38316038,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323451,1735577363,"Vietnamese Police Bust $1M Crypto Scam, Safeguard 300 Victims","According to Vtv , the Hanoi City Police Department has prevented 300 potential victims from falling prey to an elaborate crypto scam that had already defrauded 30 billion Vietnamese dong ($1.17 million) from approximately 100 businesses and 400 individuals. The fraudulent operation, spearheaded by the company Million Smiles, was dismantled after months of investigation, resulting in the apprehension of key individuals linked to the scheme. Million Smiles lured victims by aggressively promoting its in-house cryptocurrency, QFS (Quantum Financial System), through large-scale seminars, social media campaigns, and influencer endorsements. The company framed QFS as a spiritually backed asset tied to ancestral treasures, amplifying its reach by leveraging community gatherings and religious events to instill trust and urgency among potential investors. The company falsely claimed that holding QFS coins would grant access to a financial ecosystem that offers benefits such as interest-free capital and participation in lucrative ventures. Million Smiles’ Crypto Scam: How Vietnamese Police Saved Potential Victims The fraudulent activities of Million Smiles began unraveling when Hanoi police detected suspicious movements by the company. Trieu Nu Cuoi, the legal entity behind Million Smiles, had planned a large conference at Bao Son Paradise in An Khanh Commune, Hoai Duc District, Hanoi, on December 24, 2024, to target 300 more investors. The scheme aimed to expand the sale of QFS coins, priced at 4-5 million VND ($190) for individuals and 39 million VND ($1,350) for businesses. Acting swiftly, the Hanoi police coordinated an urgent raid on the company’s headquarters, seizing documents, computers, and promotional materials. Source: VTV Investigations revealed that the QFS tokens were fictitious and lacked recognition by Vietnamese law. Million Smiles managed to entice victims from rural areas like Yen Bai by exploiting cultural beliefs and promising future wealth, where individuals invested substantial sums, hoping to gain financial freedom. The scam’s mastermind had carefully curated an image of credibility by renting luxurious villas and organizing high-profile events. After that, victims were persuaded that hidden treasures backed QFS and that purchasing the coin would secure their place in an exclusive economic ecosystem. However, as authorities uncovered, the company’s leadership had no actual assets or backing for their claims. Vietnam’s Ongoing Battle Against Crypto Fraud Vietnamese authorities are cracking down on Million Smiles as part of a broader effort to address the rising tide of crypto-related fraud. This latest case follows a series of high-profile arrests, including the October 2024 discovery of an elaborate crypto fraud and cybercrime network in Southeast Asia. Thousands of Indian citizens are being lured by fake job offers that trap them in Southeast Asia’s cybercrime networks, forcing them to participate in crypto fraud, phishing, and online scams . Many victims are detained in guarded compounds, stripped of their passports, and coerced into targeting fellow Indians through investment scams and social media fraud. Reports estimate that nearly 30,000 Indians remain unaccounted for between January 2022 and May 2024, with scams resulting in significant financial losses. The Indian government, in collaboration with Southeast Asian authorities, is actively working to rescue and repatriate victims while also issuing public warnings to prevent further exploitation. Vietnamese authorities have repeatedly issued warnings, with Nguyen Van Dinh, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Public Security’s Cybersecurity Department, stating, “We urge citizens to remain vigilant and thoroughly verify any investment involving virtual currencies, as fraudsters are increasingly exploiting digital assets to deceive investors.” The Hanoi City Police Department emphasized that while cryptocurrency remains a growing topic of interest in Vietnam, the public must stay informed and be wary of extravagant promises that lack credible backing.

38316036,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323346,1735577227,China’s Central Bank Highlights Hong Kong’s Crypto Licensing in 2024 Report,"The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has released its “ China Financial Stability Report (2024) ,” shedding light on the country’s financial stability measures and economic progress over the past year. A significant portion of the report is dedicated to global crypto regulations, with a notable emphasis on Hong Kong’s proactive approach to crypto licensing. According to the report, In 2023, its GDP exceeded 126 trillion yuan (Approximately $17.79 Trillion), reflecting a 5.2% year-on-year increase. Source: TradingEconomics This growth was primarily driven by strong performance in the technology, export, and renewable energy sectors, which saw significant investment and innovation throughout the year. The financial system’s stability was highlighted as a crucial factor in achieving economic targets, and measures taken to mitigate risks in sectors such as real estate and banking were thoroughly detailed. However, the report acknowledges the growing influence of digital assets in the global financial ecosystem and Hong Kong’s role as a testing ground for new crypto policies. Hong Kong’s Crypto Regulation: Could This Influence China’s Stance On Crypto? According to an excerpt , one key takeaway from the PBOC’s report is the attention given to Hong Kong’s dual-license system for managing crypto assets. As China maintains strict control over cryptocurrency activities within the mainland, Hong Kong has introduced structured frameworks to integrate virtual assets into its financial landscape. However, the evolving nature of crypto markets necessitates continuous regulatory adjustments, which has placed pressure on policymakers to balance innovation with investor protection. The report elaborates on Hong Kong’s bifurcated approach, which classifies crypto assets into securitized and non-securitized categories governed by distinct legislative frameworks. Under this system, “security tokens” fall under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Futures Ordinance, while “non-security tokens” are regulated by the Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance. As the report claims, this dual oversight aims to mitigate risks associated with crypto trading while fostering innovation in the fintech sector. Additionally, major financial players, including HSBC and Standard Chartered, are mandated to extend their compliance frameworks to crypto exchanges further to align traditional banking practices with emerging digital markets. The report suggests that Hong Kong’s licensing approach may serve as a blueprint for broader financial reform in China, potentially influencing future policy shifts in the mainland. Global Crypto Trends and China’s Cautious Approach The PBOC report also highlights global cryptocurrency trends, particularly emphasizing the increased regulatory scrutiny following market volatility in 2022. Despite a market rebound in 2023, with the global crypto market capitalization exceeding $3.9 trillion this year, Chinese regulators remain cautious about the systemic risks posed by digital assets. Source: Coingecko They cite concerns over potential capital outflows, market manipulation, and the lack of investor protection in decentralized environments. The report also cites efforts by international bodies, such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to establish a unified regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Particularly, China’s central bank stressed the importance of international cooperation in addressing crypto-related risks. It references the FSB’s July 2023 release of an international regulatory framework for crypto assets. This framework promotes the principle of “same activities, same risks, same supervision,” advocating for uniform regulatory standards across different markets. Notably, Hong Kong has recently pledged to implement the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) by 2026 to enhance international tax transparency and address cross-border tax evasion in the crypto sector.

38312897,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634946,1735577218,"Huawei slashes prices of several high-end devices to survive China markets, plans AI chip mass production by 2025","According to reports from China, Huawei Technologies, the Chinese tech giant, has lowered pricing for several high-end handsets in new efforts to stimulate sales. In addition, the entity plans to begin mass-producing its most advanced AI processor in the first quarter of 2025. According to Huawei’s official online store , Vmall, the company has reduced the price of its top-of-the-line Pura 70 Ultra device, launched in April, to 8,999 yuan (US$1,233) for the 1 terabyte version. This represents an 18% reduction from the original price of 10,999 yuan. The 512 gigabyte version is being sold at a 20% discount. In addition, the Mate X5, a foldable smartphone introduced in September 2023, is currently available at a discounted price of 2,500 yuan. This is 19% less than its original starting price of 12,999 yuan. Based on data from research firm CINNO, the model has been the most popular foldable handset in China since its introduction. People familiar with the matter say Huawei has been struggling to make enough chips due to U.S. restrictions. Could it be that the organization needs more funding, hence this move? Huawei initiative According to the consulting firm Canalys, the Shenzhen-based company’s local shipments of high-end smartphones (phones that cost more than US$600) rose 34% in the September quarter. That gave Huawei a 33% share of its home market, getting closer to Apple, which still had a 52% share and was in first place. In September, Huawei introduced the Mate XT, the world’s first trifold smartphone. According to Counterpoint, the devices and the Mate X6 are anticipated to further solidify the company’s dominant position in the segment. Per CINNO, Huawei shipped 1.12 million foldable handsets in the third quarter, a 97% increase from the previous year. The research firm says the Mate X5 was a significant factor in the increase in shipments. However, according to researchers at TechInsights, the current Mate 70 series is seeing lower sales due to weaker processors than competitors. Counterpoint Research predicts that the Mate 70 series handsets will ship in excess of 10 million units over their lifetime. Still, the Mate 70’s release was closely watched by the industry to see how Huawei was doing with chip development. The US-banned company put a 7-nanometer chip in its Mate 60 series smartphones last year. Huawei’s smartphones use South Korean memory chips TechInsights, a research firm, has reported that Huawei Technologies’ most recent line of flagship smartphones is equipped with memory chips manufactured by South Korean semiconductor supplier SK Hynix. This is because Chinese-made alternatives are scarce due to a US-led export prohibition on advanced chipmaking equipment to the mainland. In addition, analysts at the Canadian company discovered SK Hynix’s 12-gigabyte low-power mobile DRAM and 512GB NAND within a Huawei Mate 70 Pro handset. The 16GB DRAM and NAND from SK Hynix were identical to those of the Mate 70 Pro Plus, which was, notably, the more expensive model. According to TechInsights senior analyst Jeongdong Choe, SK Hynix used 14-nanometer technology and advanced extreme ultraviolet lithography to build these mobile DRAM modules. NAND is a form of memory used for flash storage, whereas DRAM, or dynamic random-access memory, is widely utilized in smartphones and computers. Reports assert that SK Hynix began mass-producing the DRAM chips featured in the Mate 70 Pro in the second half of 2021. This was nine months after the US cut off Huawei’s access to processors and other US technologies, such as Google services, significantly affecting the Chinese company’s smartphone business. Huawei to mass-produce newest AI chip in early 2025 According to reports, the telecoms giant has sent models of its newest chip, the Ascend 910C, to some tech companies and has begun taking orders for it. The Ascend 910C is meant to compete with chips made by the U.S. company Nvidia. According to a source who was informed of the results, the 910C is being manufactured by the renowned Chinese contract chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) (0981.HK), which has opened a new tab on its N+2 process. However, due to a lack of advanced manufacturing equipment, the chip’s yield has been restricted to approximately 20%. However, to be commercially viable, advanced processors must have yields exceeding 70%. The sources stated that Huawei was compelled to reduce production targets and postpone the fulfillment of orders for the 910B, the company’s most sophisticated processor, due to its yield of only approximately 50%. So here we go. Huawei’s Ascend 910B AI chip has been found in some tests to deliver 80 per cent of the efficiency of an Nvidia A100 when training large language models, but “in some other tests, Ascend chips can beat the A100 by 20 per cent”, said Wang Tao, chief operating… pic.twitter.com/YsM8Aejwgi — SlavicFreeSpirit (@SlavFreeSpirit) June 8, 2024 However, The U.S.-China trade and security dispute is centered around Huawei. Washington has implemented a series of restrictions on Huawei and other Chinese companies. They contend that their technological advancements pose a national security threat to the US. These constraints have hindered Huawei’s capacity to achieve a sufficient yield for its advanced AI chips. This percentage is of completely functional chips that exit the manufacturing line to render them commercially viable.

Over 2 billion SOLX tokens have already been staked by early adopters, further demonstrating confidence in the project. Solaxy Addresses Solana’s Biggest Pain Points Solaxy is not just your standard new crypto project. It’s created a powerful new approach to solving Solana’s most pressing issues – network congestion, scalability limitations, and failed transactions – in order to provide genuine utility. As Solana continues to attract users with its high transaction speeds, low fees, and versatile developer tools, the network has struggled to handle the massive influx of new traffic. This has become particularly apparent since the explosion of Solana meme coin activity in 2024. By offloading transaction processing to its own infrastructure (while maintaining compatibility with Solana’s ecosystem), Solaxy ensures seamless operations even during peak network activity. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1867318005660889427 Compatible With Two Blockchain Giants Moreover, the SOLX token is compatible not only with Solana, but also with Ethereum. This enables Solaxy to combine the best features of both networks. By leveraging Ethereum’s liquidity and security alongside Solana’s speed, low fees, and scalability, Solaxy creates a robust ecosystem designed to accommodate the growing demands of traffic-heavy blockchain sectors – including decentralized finance (DeFi), GameFi, and meme coin trading. By combining these strengths, Solaxy positions itself as a versatile platform capable of addressing the needs of blockchain project builders, retail investors, and institutional players alike. Solaxy’s Strong Community Support The success of the SOLX presale is a testament to the project’s passionate community of investors, future developers, and users. The popular YouTuber Stock Investor (who has over 51,000 followers) recently posted a video on how to buy the SOLX token: With over 40,000 followers on social media, and stellar endorsements from influential crypto figureheads like Stock Investor and Cl a yBro , Solaxy has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts worldwide.

This meteoric rise turned early holders into millionaires and ignited a ""memecoin season,"" with many similar tokens experiencing dramatic peaks and plunges.

This honesty appeals to a community looking for straightforward, community-driven projects. In the current market cycle, PEPE taps into the enthusiasm for meme-based assets, much like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu did before. Its roadmap hints at big ambitions, including listings on major exchanges and a ""meme takeover.""

For those intrigued by the power of internet culture in finance, PEPE offers a glimpse into a dynamic and unpredictable market trend.

For the eighth consecutive week, MicroStrategy has ramped up its Bitcoin holdings. Recently, it purchased an additional 2,138 BTC for $209 million in the week ending December 29. This move brings the company’s total bitcoin stash to a staggering 446,400 BTC, further cementing its market dominance. MicroStrategy has acquired 2,138 BTC for ~$209 million at ~$97,837 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 47.8% QTD and 74.1% YTD. As of 12/29/2024, we hodl 446,400 $BTC acquired for ~$27.9 billion at ~$62,428 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/58aXM7g6u2 — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 30, 2024 Bitcoin: The Core of MicroStrategy’s Strategy MicroStrategy’s commitment to Bitcoin is not just about holding the asset; it is a key part of the company’s business model. The company has surpassed publicly traded companies in building the largest digital currency reserve. MicroStrategy’s strategy is clear: buy as much Bitcoin as possible and hold it long-term. Its relentless buying spree is financed by its at-the-market (ATM) program, which still has a substantial $6.88 billion in available funds. Despite fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy remains unwavering in its commitment. The average price it paid for its latest Bitcoin purchase is $97,837. This brings its holdings’ overall average purchase price to $62,428 per Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $92,009.61, down 2.66% in the last 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap data. This is 14.81% below its all-time high (ATH) of $108,000. MicroStrategy’s investment strategy strongly believes in Bitcoin’s future value, no matter the short-term market swings. Michael Saylor’s Role in the Push Much of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-centric approach can be attributed to its Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor. Saylor is a staunch advocate for Bitcoin , consistently emphasizing its role as a hedge against inflation. He believes the digital currency is a reliable long-term store of value. Saylor’s leadership has reshaped MicroStrategy’s business model. Also, his investment in Bitcoin has drawn attention from investors and other corporate firms. MicroStrategy’s Market Position and Nasdaq 100 Inclusion MicroStrategy’s expansion into the crypto space has not gone unnoticed in the broader financial world. In a significant milestone, the company recently joined the Nasdaq 100 , a prestigious index of the largest companies in the U.S. The company now ranks 57th in the index, weighing 0.38%. This is a big deal for a company that has pivoted dramatically from software development to crypto investment. However, despite this success, MicroStrategy’s stock price has declined. The company’s share price is currently 40% lower than its ATH of $534 per share, reached on November 21. As of pre-market trading, MicroStrategy’s stock price hovers around $320 per share, a 3% drop. This volatility is a reflection of the unpredictable nature of both the stock market and the cryptocurrency landscape.

AVAX: Eco-friendly blockchain with rapid transactions and customizable subnets AVAX is the native token of Avalanche , a Layer-1 blockchain platform known for its eco-friendly approach, low fees, and rapid transaction processing capabilities of up to 4,500 transactions per second. Avalanche utilizes a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto consensus principles, achieving transaction finality in less than two seconds. The platform consists of three interoperable chains — the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain — that facilitate various operations like transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX plays a pivotal role within the ecosystem, serving for transaction fees, network security through staking, and enabling the creation of customizable Subnets. The technology’s scalability and unique features position AVAX as a promising asset in the current market cycle. Kaspa : A proof-of-work cryptocurrency with GHOSTDAG Protocol Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, GHOSTDAG does not discard blocks created at the same time. Instead, it allows them to coexist and orders them in consensus. This makes the Kaspa blockchain a blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) rather than a linear chain. This design enables high block rates, currently one block per second, with goals to increase further. Kaspa includes features like Reachability for querying the DAG, block data pruning, SPV proofs, and plans for future support of layer 2 solutions. In the current market cycle, Kaspa’s technology may appeal to those interested in scalable proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. Conclusion While AVAX and KAS show potential, their short-term growth lags behind DOGEN. DOGEN appeals to those seeking luxury and success, with expected 700% growth by presale’s end and potential for massive returns during this altcoin season. Following in the footsteps of BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks.

Solana (SOL) Solana is making waves in the blockchain world by focusing on speed and scalability. It's a platform where developers can build apps, much like Ethereum and Cardano. But what sets Solana apart is how fast it can process transactions. This speed comes from its unique design, which doesn't rely on splitting the network into pieces or adding extra layers. Developers also appreciate the flexibility to use different programming languages. At the center of it all is SOL, Solana's own cryptocurrency. SOL is used for transactions, running programs, and rewarding people who support the network. Right now, SOL looks promising in the market. Its value comes from powering the entire Solana ecosystem. As more projects and apps choose Solana for its high capacity and speed, SOL could become even more important. Compared to other coins, SOL's focus on fast and efficient transactions gives it an edge. Market trends show a demand for networks that can handle a lot of activity without slowing down. Solana seems ready to meet that need, which could make SOL an attractive option for both developers and investors. Aptos (APt) Aptos, a new player in the blockchain world, is making waves. Often called a ""Solana Killer,"" it aims to solve the problems of high fees and slow transactions that haunt older blockchains like Ethereum. Built by Aptos Labs, which includes key contributors from Meta's Diem project, Aptos uses a Proof-of-Stake system. It focuses on speed and safety, using the Move programming language to power its smart contracts. This makes it flexible and ready to support a range of Web3 applications. The potential of Aptos lies in its promise of scalability and reliability. By addressing the issues that trouble other networks, it could become a strong competitor in the crypto space. In the current market, where investors seek faster and cheaper options, Aptos seems attractive. Its roots with former Meta developers add to its credibility. While Ethereum has shifted to Proof-of-Stake to reduce congestion, there's still room for fresh solutions like Aptos. Compared to Solana, which has faced its own challenges, Aptos might offer a more robust platform. As the demand for efficient blockchain solutions grows, Aptos could be poised to make a significant impact. TRON (TRX) Imagine a world where content creators own their work fully and get rewarded fairly. This is the vision behind TRON (TRX), a decentralized blockchain platform launched in 2017. Originally built on Ethereum, TRON moved to its own network in 2018. It allows creators to share content directly with consumers, cutting out middlemen like YouTube and Facebook. This means artists, writers, and musicians can earn more from their work while connecting directly with their audience. TRON isn't just about content; it also supports decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts, making it a strong alternative to Ethereum. With low transaction fees and high scalability, it's attracting developers and users alike. In the current market, TRX stands out due to its focus on decentralizing the internet and empowering creators. As more people value direct interaction and fair compensation online, TRON's potential grows. Compared to other coins, TRX offers unique benefits for digital content, making it an attractive option in today's crypto landscape. cat in a dogs world (MEW) In a world overrun by dog-themed cryptocurrencies, MEW emerges as the bold cat ready to shake things up. MEW is a new coin on the block, aiming to save the crypto landscape from the overwhelming number of dog coins. While many tokens follow the same canine trend, MEW offers a fresh and playful twist. It's not just about being different; MEW brings a unique charm that stands out in the crowded market. The current crypto cycle is ripe for innovation, and MEW could be the refreshing change enthusiasts are seeking. As investors grow weary of similar projects, a coin with a distinct theme and potential like MEW becomes attractive. Compared to other meme coins that have had their moment, MEW seems poised to capture attention. With its combination of a fun concept and the promise of something new, MEW might just be the cat's meow in today's market. Popcat (POPCAT) POPCAT is a new player in the crypto world, inspired by the viral Internet meme featuring Oatmeal the cat. In October 2020, Oatmeal captured hearts with two iconic images: one with his mouth closed, and another edited to form a surprised 'O' shape. Riding on this meme's popularity, the POPCAT token was born—not as a serious investment, but as a lighthearted meme coin meant purely for entertainment. It has no inherent value or financial expectations, making it a fun addition to the crypto space. In a market often filled with complex projects, POPCAT stands out with its playful approach. While it doesn't offer groundbreaking technology or practical utility, its charm lies in community engagement and the joy of sharing a laugh. With meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu gaining attention, POPCAT could attract those looking for the next viral sensation. Its appeal is tied to social trends rather than fundamentals. Whether POPCAT becomes the next big thing or remains a fun footnote depends on the whims of the internet community. Conclusion Though SOL, APT, TRX, and MEW are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the pioneering all-sport memecoin uniting fans and aiming for significant growth through community engagement.

38314991,https://invezz.com/?p=2410842,1735576800,Can Bitcoin’s price double by 2025? Expert analysis after rally slows,"Bitcoin’s remarkable rally in 2024 stunned the world but with the advent of the new year only hours away, the rally seems to be stalling. The cryptocurrency, which surged to a record high of $108,000 in mid-December, was trading at $93,670 early Monday in New York, 16% below the high. Smaller tokens like Ether and meme favourite Dogecoin have also struggled to gain traction in recent days. The BTC rally was fuelled by the US election results owing to President-elect Donald Trump’s favourable stance toward cryptocurrencies . Investors loaded up on the cryptocurrency driven by Trump’s proposals of building a national Bitcoin reserve and making the regulatory environment easier for crypto firms. A month later, he named Paul Atkins as the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair who will replace Gary Gensler, known for bringing more than a hundred actions against crypto firms during his tenure. However, the enthusiasm has gradually been tempered by reduced expectations of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, which have cooled speculative activity across financial markets. Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, said that “the momentum has come out of the post-election move” in Bitcoin, citing outflows from exchange-traded funds focused on the cryptocurrency as evidence of this slowdown. At the same time, MicroStrategy, the software company turned Bitcoin accumulator, has been on a buying spree in recent weeks . With over $40 billion in Bitcoin holdings, the company is closely watched by traders, who anticipate regular announcements of new purchases. Invezz takes a look at the many aspects that might shape Bitcoin’s price trajectory in 2025, and the many milestones it could possibly touch: BTC 2025 outlook: Experts weigh in Despite the current stall, analysts maintain a largely optimistic view of Bitcoin’s future. Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, dismissed the recent pullback as a temporary blip. Thorn predicts that Bitcoin will surpass $150,000 in the first half of 2025 and potentially “test or best” $185,000 by the end of that year. “A combination of institutional, corporate, and nation state adoption will propel Bitcoin to new heights in 2025,” Thorn wrote, adding, Throughout its existence, Bitcoin has appreciated faster than all other asset classes, particularly the S&P 500 and gold, and that trend will continue in 2025. Not all market observers share this bullish outlook. Rania Gule, an analyst at XS.com, warned on Monday that Bitcoin could slide to $85,000 in the near term due to the expiration of approximately $14 billion worth of options contracts. Blockware’s scenarios for BTC’s 2025 price Blockware Research has outlined three potential trajectories for Bitcoin’s price in 2025, depending on macroeconomic and policy developments: Bear Case: Bitcoin could rise modestly to $150,000, and this scenario would take place if the Fed kept interest rates higher for longer, and long-term holders started aggressively selling their Bitcoin. The bull-run could also be hindered by a failure of the Trump administration to act on the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Plan. Base Case: Bitcoin reaches $225,000, supported by Federal Reserve rate cuts, steady corporate adoption, and the establishment of Bitcoin as a US reserve asset through the SBR initiative. Bull Case: Bitcoin soars to $400,000, driven by ultra-dovish Federal Reserve policies, accelerated corporate adoption, and a significant expansion of the US government’s Bitcoin reserves.

Discover which coins might redefine investment portfolios and become standout performers in the near future. XYZVerse: The Best New Meme Project You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum has revolutionized the way we think about the internet and finance. Since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced smart contracts that power a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). This includes everything from finance to art, all running on a pioneering Proof-of-Stake blockchain. Ethereum's shift to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 made the network more efficient and sustainable. Upcoming upgrades like sharding aim to boost scalability and reduce costs, reinforcing its commitment to decentralization and innovation. In the current market, Ethereum stands out for its robust technology and potential for growth. Ether (ETH), the network's native coin, is essential for transactions and rewards. With predictions estimating its price could reach new heights next year, Ethereum looks attractive to many observers. Its extensive ecosystem, including Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, enhances transaction efficiency and positions Ethereum ahead of many other coins. As the crypto space evolves, Ethereum's continuous advancements keep it at the forefront of blockchain technology. JasmyCoin (JASMY) In today's connected world, our devices—from phones to cars—are constantly exchanging data. JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency project from Tokyo-based Jasmy Corporation that aims to give you control over your personal information. By combining the Internet of Things (IoT) with blockchain technology, Jasmy creates a platform where users can securely store and share their data. Instead of big companies holding all the data, Jasmy's approach allows individuals to own and manage their information, turning it into personal assets. Jasmy's platform offers a secure environment for data exchange without the need to trust third parties. It decentralizes the workflow by using edge computing and storing data on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This means your data is protected and stays in your hands. In the current market, with growing concerns about data privacy and security, projects like JasmyCoin stand out. While many cryptocurrencies focus on financial transactions, Jasmy focuses on data ownership. As more people become aware of the value of their personal data, JasmyCoin could play a significant role in the future of the IoT and blockchain space. Ethena (ENA) Meet Ethena, a fresh face in the crypto world that's changing how we view digital money. Built on Ethereum, Ethena offers a synthetic dollar that doesn't rely on traditional banks. This means anyone, anywhere, can access a stable digital currency without the usual banking hurdles. Plus, Ethena introduces the ""Internet Bond,"" a global savings option denominated in dollars. It's like having a worldwide savings account accessible to anyone with internet access. In today's market, Ethena stands out. While many coins face volatility, Ethena focuses on stability and accessibility. Its synthetic dollar could be a game-changer for those looking for dependability in crypto. Compared to other coins, Ethena doesn't just offer another token—it provides a practical solution for everyday financial needs. With trends moving towards decentralized finance, Ethena's approach aligns well with current interests. For investors seeking a promising opportunity in this market cycle, Ethena could be an attractive option. PEPE (PEPE) PEPE is a fresh face in the cryptocurrency scene, launched as a tribute to the beloved Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie. As a deflationary memecoin on Ethereum, it embraces the fun and viral nature of internet culture. In late April to May 2023, PEPE's value soared, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion. This meteoric rise turned early holders into millionaires and ignited a ""memecoin season,"" with many similar tokens experiencing dramatic peaks and plunges. What sets PEPE apart is its simplicity—it has no transaction taxes and openly admits it has no utility beyond being a meme. This honesty appeals to a community looking for straightforward, community-driven projects. In the current market cycle, PEPE taps into the enthusiasm for meme-based assets, much like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu did before. Its roadmap hints at big ambitions, including listings on major exchanges and a ""meme takeover."" While it's uncertain if PEPE will reach new heights, it has captured the attention of many who are optimistic about a potential bull run as the next Bitcoin halving approaches. For those intrigued by the power of internet culture in finance, PEPE offers a glimpse into a dynamic and unpredictable market trend. Conclusion Though ETH, JASMY, ENA, and PEPE are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its sports meme platform aiming for 20,000% growth.

38312451,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27893,1735576540,Hong Kong Legislator Proposes Adding Bitcoin to National Reserves,"Unleashing Bitcoin’s Strategic Potential Hong Kong’s Legislative Council member Wu Jiexhuang has called for the addition of Bitcoin to Hong Kong’s national reserves in order to enhance its financial security. He suggests that the “one country, two systems” policy should be utilized to make Hong Kong’s path different from the mainland’s more conservative one in terms of cryptocurrencies. Jiexhuang believes that by studying the U.S.-based Bitcoin ETF market impact, Hong Kong could become a global hotbed for both innovation and adoption of cryptocurrencies . Drawing inspiration from El Salvador and Bhutan, which have already incorporated Bitcoin into their national reserves, Jiexhuang spoke to the opportunity of Hong Kong attracting global talent and investment. He also pointed to U.S. states and initiatives that have actively explored the inclusion of Bitcoin in strategic reserves, citing growing international recognition of digital assets as legitimate financial tools. China’s Role in Financial Stability Jiexhuang stressed that Hong Kong should make full use of its unique governance structure to experiment with the adoption of Bitcoin. He said the inclusion of Bitcoin in exchange-traded funds could be the least-risky way for broader adoption and give a first-mover advantage in the financial sector. China, having confiscated 190,000 Bitcoins through various confiscation efforts, is enumerated as the world’s number two holder of Bitcoin after the United States. Thus, Jiexhuang made a case that should a country like the US hold BTC as a strategi c reserve, it would both stabilize its price and incentivize other nations in similar respects. Which, he cautioned, will impact fiscal reserves all across the board due to dwindling demand for all other assets. Hong Kong Regulatory Developments The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau of Hong Kong will apply laws and regulations to establish them as a cryptocurrency leader using the principle of “same business, same risks, same rules”. These will provide a balanced and safe environment for crypto adoption while ensuring financial stability. In early 2024, Legislative Council member Johnny Ng intends to collaborate with stakeholders on assessing the merits of adding Bitcoin into Hong Kong’s financial reserves. He noted the growing relevance of Bitcoin around the world in redefining the more conventional forms of financial systems. Hong Kong has been quite proactive in embracing cryptocurrencies and might just turn out to be a model for integrating digital assets into national reserves and setting a precedent in the area of financial innovation across the region.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/hong-kong-legislator-proposes-adding-bitcoin/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

This isn't a fantasy but a real possibility with certain overlooked cryptocurrencies. This article uncovers five lesser-known digital coins that hold the potential for extraordinary returns. Discover which low-cap cryptos could be the next big breakthrough and how they might transform a small investment into life-changing wealth. XYZVerse: The Best New Meme Project You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution.

The first-mover advantage is key here – get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! >>Don’t be left on the bench – grab your XYZ tokens now and be part of the next massive crypto championship! Jito (JTO) Jito Network is making waves in the Solana community with its innovative JitoSOL liquid staking pool and a suite of MEV products. By exchanging their SOL for JitoSOL, users keep their assets liquid and can still explore DeFi opportunities while earning staking rewards. What sets JitoSOL apart is the extra earnings holders receive from transaction revenue linked to MEV extraction on Solana. MEV, or maximum extractable value, refers to profits made from the order in which transactions are processed. For example, a large swap on one platform might create a price difference that traders can exploit elsewhere. The Jito Foundation aims to reduce the negative effects of MEV, ensure profits are shared fairly, and promote transparency. They've released an open-source validator client that fosters a competitive market for MEV extraction. This client allows auctions within each block, where traders bid for the chance to capture MEV. The highest bidders can then harvest these additional profits. In today's growing DeFi and staking market, JitoSOL offers a unique way for users to potentially enhance their rewards while supporting the Solana network. Arkham (ARKM) Arkham is a platform that uses artificial intelligence to reveal what's happening on the blockchain. Think of it as a detective that can track and analyze crypto activities. It has two main parts. The Analytics Platform lets you see detailed information about exchanges, big investors, and tokens. You can check their holdings, transactions, and how they interact with others. The Intel Exchange is a marketplace where people buy and sell information about blockchain addresses. This means anyone can contribute to uncovering hidden details in the crypto world. This technology has the potential to make the crypto market more transparent. By shedding light on hidden activities, Arkham can help track stolen funds, expose fraudsters, and verify transactions. This is important as scams and hacks are common in the crypto space. Some people worry that revealing identities goes against the idea of privacy in crypto. But Arkham says it only uses public information and doesn't collect personal data. In a market where security is a growing concern, Arkham's approach might appeal to investors. Compared to other coins, it offers a unique way to enhance trust in the blockchain through AI. Synthetix (SNX) Synthetix is a platform that's transforming the world of decentralized finance. Built on Ethereum and Optimism, it provides deep liquidity and low fees for other projects to use. This opens the door for many apps like Kwenta, Lyra, Polynomial, 1inch, and Curve to power their services with Synthetix. What's unique about Synthetix is that it lets people create and trade synthetic assets, called Synths, without needing to own the real asset. These Synths are backed by pooled collateral like SNX, ETH, and LUSD, making it a powerful tool in the crypto space. Looking ahead, Synthetix has exciting plans with upcoming releases like Perps V2 and Synthetix V3. Perps V2 aims to offer low-fee futures trading on-chain, and Synthetix V3 is set to make the protocol fully open and permissionless. By introducing assets that aren't native to the blockchain, Synthetix is opening doors to a wider financial market. In the current market, where decentralized finance is growing fast, platforms like Synthetix stand out for their innovation. Compared to other coins, SNX could play a key role in the future of finance, bridging the gap between traditional assets and the crypto world. OriginTrail (TRAC) OriginTrail is building a trusted knowledge infrastructure for artificial intelligence in a world where misinformation is a big problem. By ensuring the origin of information and making the world's most important knowledge and real-world assets discoverable, it tackles the challenges posed by misinformation in the AI era. OriginTrail uses its unique Decentralized Knowledge Graph and OriginTrail Parachain to deliver AI-powered search and solutions for businesses and people around the globe. This technology empowers world-class brands and creators to build a Verifiable Web for decentralized AI. OriginTrail has partnerships with notable organizations like the British Standards Institution, Polkadot, Walmart, and the EU Commission's Next Generation Internet. These collaborations help advance its trusted knowledge foundation across trillion-dollar industries. The ChatDKG, an experimental question-answering bot on Twitter, showcases the technology in action. With its ambitious roadmap, including the Metcalfe phase aiming to create the world's largest verifiable web for AI with 100 billion Knowledge Assets, OriginTrail is set to bring significant scalability increases. As the project moves forward, it leverages AI advancements to unlock autonomous knowledge mining, reducing the need for human involvement. In the current market cycle, projects focusing on AI and blockchain integration, like OriginTrail, are gaining attention as the demand for trustworthy AI solutions grows. Conclusion While JTO, ARKM, SNX, and TRAC have strong potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) distinguishes itself by uniting sports fans in a unique memecoin ecosystem aiming for significant growth and cultural impact.

Notably, Genius Group Limited has purchased $30 million worth of Bitcoin within six weeks of announcing its “Bitcoin-first” strategy, committing to hold 90% or more of its current and future reserves in Bitcoin, with an initial target of $120 million. The company has already reached 25% of this target ahead of schedule. Genius Group Achieves 1,649% BTC Yield Genius Group has adopted BTC Yield as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) to evaluate the effectiveness of its Bitcoin Treasury strategy. This approach aims to benefit shareholders and allows the company to compare its performance with other Bitcoin Standard companies. Remarkably, Genius Group achieved a BTC Yield of 1,649% in Q4 2024, from the first day it purchased Bitcoin in November 2024 to the date of this release on December 30, 2024. The CEO of Genius Group CEO, Roger Hamilton noted- “It has been less than two months since we launched our Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. We have been buying Bitcoin consistently and are pleased to be ahead of our internal schedule to reach our initial target of 1,000 Bitcoin in our treasury.” “Now, with a focus on BTC Yield KPI, we are considering various investment and finance options that maximize shareholder value whilst accelerating our progress in building our Bitcoin Treasury,” he added. Notably, the Company has maximized its BTC Yield in Q4 2024 by funding its purchase of Bitcoin to date through a combination of its reserves, its ATM and a $10 million Bitcoin loan it has entered into with crypto-backed loan platform, Arch Lending. Genius Group CFO, Gaurav Dama said “Whilst we are pleased to be achieving a high BTC Yield, we believe our Bitcoin performance is not yet reflected in our share price. This is indicated by Genius Group having a high BTC / Price ratio of 75%, which we believe is significantly higher than our industry peers.” Genius Group reported a 177% increase in its net asset value, reaching $54.6 million for the first half of 2024, which is higher than its current market cap of $40.6 million. The company plans to report its Bitcoin Treasury performance alongside its financial results more frequently in 2025 to keep investors informed.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/genius-group-expands-bitcoin-treasury-with-10-million-purchase/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Cardano's ADA: Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Technology Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano is known for its energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, making it more sustainable than proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contract computations. This design enhances its ability to process a high number of transactions per second. With the introduction of native tokens in March 2021, Cardano offers secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. Due to these features, ADA has significant potential in the evolving cryptocurrency market. Conclusion As the bull run of 2024 unfolds, coins like ADA show less short-term potential.

38312693,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323299,1735576260,Solana Price Analysis: SOL Co-Founder Sued for Allegedly Stealing Millions in Staking Rewards,"The Solana price has fallen by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, dropping to $192.80 as the cryptocurrency market declines by 2.5% today. SOL is still reacting to the news that Stephen Akridge is facing a lawsuit from his ex-wife , who is suing the Solana co-founder for allegedly stealing millions in staking income. This news comes as SOL remains down by 21% in the past month, although the altcoin – the sixth-biggest token in the market – holds on to a 90% increase in a year. And with the market still arguably at the earlier stages of a bull cycle, the Solana price is likely to see a strong resurgence in the coming weeks and months . Solana Price Analysis: SOL Co-Founder Sued for Allegedly Stealing Millions in Staking Rewards Akridge’s ex-wife, Elisa Rossi, filed her suit in a San Francisco court, with her lawyers claiming Akridge used his knowledge of Solana to siphon away 100% of Rossi’s staking rewards. According to Bloomberg, Solana co-founder Stephen Akridge was sued by his ex-wife Elisa Rossi, accusing him of stealing ""millions of dollars"" in rewards generated by Elisa's SOL staking, and seeking claims including breach of contract, unjust enrichment and fraud.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 28, 2024 The claim covers the period between March and May 2023, after Rossi filed for divorce from Akridge in February of the same year. Neither Solana Labs nor Akridge has commented on the case, which Rossi filed on Friday, sending the Solana price from approximately $193 to $183 in a few hours. It has since recovered, but as its chart below reveals, it remains relatively weak. Source: TradingView Its 30-period average (orange) fell below the 200-period average (blue) over the weekend, signalling further falls which arrived last night. Things have since stabilized a little, and it now looks like SOL could be close to a recovery, with its relative strength index (purple) climbing from 30 to just over 50 today. This may signal a return of strength, although SOL’s volume is still only at $2.8 billion today, down by around 80% from the highs it witnessed towards the end of November. This could suggest that Solana has already peaked, although a more optimistic interpretation is that the market is going through a lull before the inauguration of Donald Trump later next month. Trump’s return to the White House may help lift the market again, just as his election did in early November. #BITCOIN HISTORY IS REPEATING, here’s why In 2016-2017, when Trump won the U.S. elections, we saw a similar dump. It’s due to the uncertainty before the inauguration, as only then will investors officially know that Trump is in power. Once Trump is in, the real fun begins. pic.twitter.com/T0IqrH91dG — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) December 28, 2024 And with regards to Solana, 2025 could very well bring the launch of the first Solana ETFs, which seem likelier now that the pro-crypto Paul Atkins will become the SEC Chairman next month . In such a context, the Solana price could reach $250 by the end of February, and $350 by H1 2025. New Altcoins Offer Big Gains Solana is likely to be one of the best-performing major tokens of 2025, yet it certainly won’t be the only alt to enjoy strong gains next year. We’re also likely to see newer, small-cap alts do very well, including some of the bigger presale coins, which can rocket once they list for the first time. One very promising presale token right now is Solaxy (SOLX) , which has raised close to $7 million in its ongoing token offering. Is @SOLAXYTOKEN the next 10X meme coin? SOLAXY TOKEN – Presale https://t.co/GR9YK45OyQ pic.twitter.com/NQMnZvkNUC — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) December 26, 2024 Solaxy is exciting because it’s on the brink of launching Solana’s first layer-two network. As such, it will help Solana users avoid failed transactions, outages and congestion, which continue to affect the layer-one network during periods of peak traffic . SOLX will be Solaxy’s native token, and will accordingly serve as payment for transactions fees. This will give it plenty of utility, with the coin likely to experience rising demand in parallel with Solaxy’s growth. And given that holders will also be able to stake it, it could see substantial price rises over time.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is more than just digital money. It's a platform that changed how we use blockchain technology. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum introduced smart contracts and decentralized apps. This means people can build applications that run exactly as programmed, without any chance of fraud or third-party interference. In 2022, Ethereum made a big move called the Merge, shifting to a Proof-of-Stake system. This change made transactions faster and more energy-efficient. Soon, Ethereum plans to add sharding, a feature that will make it even quicker and reduce costs. Right now, Ethereum looks promising in the crypto world. While some coins simply serve as digital cash, Ethereum offers a whole ecosystem for new ideas. Its network supports decentralized finance, games, and more. With upgrades on the horizon, Ethereum aims to handle more transactions at lower fees. Compared to other coins, its strong foundation and active development make it stand out. Market trends show a growing interest in platforms that do more than just store value. Ethereum's commitment to innovation keeps it at the forefront, making it an attractive option in the current market. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It's a blockchain platform that's flexible, sustainable, and scalable. Designed for smart contracts, it helps developers create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native coin, ADA, is a rival to Ethereum's ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and even stake ADA on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its eco-friendly approach. Instead of using energy-hungry methods like Bitcoin, it uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. This means it's much more energy-efficient. But that's not all. Cardano's blockchain is split into two layers. One handles transactions, and the other deals with smart contracts. This design boosts its ability to process transactions, potentially up to a million per second. With the introduction of native tokens in March 2021, interacting with smart contracts became more secure and cheaper. This makes Cardano a strong contender in the crypto market. In the current market cycle, where scalability and sustainability are key, ADA looks attractive. Compared to other coins, its technology offers efficiency and room for growth. As the demand for decentralized apps grows, Cardano's unique features could help it rise to the top. XRP (XRP) Imagine sending money anywhere in the world in just seconds, with minimal fees and without needing a bank account. That's the promise of XRP, a digital currency built on the XRP Ledger. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was designed to be fast, low-cost, and accessible to everyone. With no central authority controlling it, transactions are secure and can't be reversed, making it a reliable option for global transfers. Ripple, the company supporting XRP, holds a large reserve to ensure stability and growth, aiming to make payments as seamless as sending a text message. In today's market, XRP stands out for its speed and efficiency compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. While Bitcoin transactions can take minutes or even hours, XRP transactions settle in mere seconds. This makes it attractive for people and businesses looking to move money quickly across borders. As the world moves towards digital payments, XRP's technology positions it well for growth. Although the crypto market is known for volatility, XRP's focus on real-world utility could make it a promising option in the current cycle, especially as more institutions look for fast and cost-effective payment solutions. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. It featured a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to other cryptocurrencies. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. There's no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. People first saw it as a ""memecoin,"" but in 2021, its value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market value, exceeding $50 billion. Social media buzz and support from Elon Musk helped drive its rise. This shows how strong communities and social media can impact financial markets. Dogecoin's technology is simple and based on earlier cryptocurrencies. Its abundance means transactions are fast and fees are low. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as an appealing option. Its popularity and strong community support keep it in the spotlight. Compared to other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin is more accessible. Market trends show continued interest in cryptocurrencies. As more people enter the market, coins like Dogecoin may continue to gain attention. However, its price can be very volatile. It's important to stay informed and understand the risks before getting involved. Conclusion With the bull run here, ETH, ADA, XRP, and DOGE are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, aiming for massive growth and uniting sports fans worldwide.

38312187,https://crypto.news/?p=14323369,1735576050,Bitcoin price is crashing: technicals point to a 20% dip,"Bitcoin price continued its strong downward trend even after MicroStrategy and Tether announced fresh acquisitions. Bitcoin ( BTC ) traded near the $91,000 level on Monday, Dec. 30, down by 15% from its highest level this year, and technicals suggest that it has more downside. This decline persisted despite MicroStrategy announced it had acquired 2,138 more Bitcoins last week, marking the eighth consecutive week of purchases and bringing its total holdings to 446,400. Tether also added 7,630 Bitcoins, increasing its total holdings to over $7.7 billion. Other large companies, including Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, and Hut 8 Mining, have also continued to increase their Bitcoin reserves. Bitcoin’s retreat can be attributed to profit-taking by investors who have benefited from its more than twofold increase this year. The decline is also tied to a risk-off sentiment in the market, evidenced by the US dollar index rising to $108.14 and significant declines in the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100, which fell by 670 and 320 points, respectively.

Bond vigilantes typically push bond yields higher when budget deficits rise. These dynamics have driven the 30-year yield to 4.76% and the 5-year yield to 4.3%, near their highest levels this year. As we wrote before, there are concerns that the soaring bond yields could lead to downside risks in the crypto and stock market in 2025. Bitcoin price could crash to $73,780 Bitcoin chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that BTC has retreated sharply in recent days. It has flipped the 50-day Exponential Moving Average into a resistance level and is now attempting to fall below the key support at $91,430, a level it has tested three times this month without breaking. Additionally, Bitcoin appears to have formed a head and shoulders pattern, a widely recognized bearish reversal indicator. It has also dropped below the weak, stop & reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines at $93,750. As a result, Bitcoin may drop to the next major support level at $73,780, the peak from March 14. If this happens, Bitcoin could see a further decline of approximately 20% from its current price.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Who are the visionaries, what helps them find new business opportunities; how to test an idea and hold a foresight session. Read to find out. Table of Contents Ideas that lack technology Lado Okhotnikov is a visionary in the field of personalized medicine Dara Ladjevardian “brings people to life” with one sentence Sam Altman is a creator of the global human recognition system How to become a visionary and what is a foresight session Who are visionaries and how does their approach change the deep tech market? We’ll find out what helps Lado Okhotnikov, Sam Altman and Dara Ladjevardian discover new business opportunities. And we’re going to talk about how to test your idea and conduct a foresight session to find a path to the future. Visionaries are people who see the future where most people only notice the present. They anticipate trends, set the direction, and find opportunities that are not yet obvious. Of course, there are inventions like the “thinnest smartphone” or the “lightest shoes”, which are interesting, but this is not about visionaries. For example, Nick Szabo is often called a visionary for his “Bit Gold” concept, which explained how to create money on the Internet that does not depend on banks or the state. Satoshi Nakamoto, who has become an idol for modern crypto visionaries, not only developed Szabo’s idea, he created a working system, described in his article Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. Jaron Lanier is considered a visionary in the field of virtual reality: he coined the term “ virtual reality. ” Subsequently, Neil Stephenson refined this concept and introduced the term “ metaverse. ” The Metaverse is not just a game. It is a virtual space that lives its own life. People communicate there, create projects, build businesses and have fun. And even if you are not there, something is still happening there . Alan Turing is another bright example of a visionary. The Turing Machine laid the foundations of the theory of computing and became the forefather of modern computers. But if we talk about the personal computers we are used to, Don Estridge also deserves the title of a visionary. He was the one who led the team that developed the IBM PC in 1981. Thus, it is difficult to say for sure who is a visionary in a particular field. Suppose someone today declares that in the near future people will be able to teleport, and even describes the process very plausibly. But until this technology is implemented, this person is more of a dreamer than a visionary. But the one who is really the first to invent a working teleport will undoubtedly deserve this title. Ideas that lack technology Just a few years ago, it was almost impossible to complete a whole human genome sequencing without machine learning, that we call artificial intelligence now. Artificial intelligence has expedited this process many times over. Gene sequencing is needed to understand how our genetic code works; it helps identify hereditary diseases, predict disease risks, select personalized treatments, and develop new drugs . Until the sequencing was completed, no one said that AI was used in this process — and this is understandable. But if you think about it, the task was, as they say, “extra credit question.” It would have taken decades to manually study 200 million “letters” of the genetic code out of 3 billion. It turns out that the Human Genome Project, officially completed in 2003 and covering 92% of the DNA sequence, was only totally finished when artificial intelligence reached the required level. The same story is now with the metaverse. It seems that everything is ready: peer-to-peer networks have been mastered (the blockchain works), devices for immersion in virtual reality have been created, the Internet has become fast enough. But for metaverses to work at full capacity, there is not enough computing power. So until a supercomputer is invented — based on quantum computing, metaverses will not be able to show what they are really capable of. Lado Okhotnikov is a visionary in the field of personalized medicine There was a time when genome sequencing seemed unrealistic. This development took 15 years of work, 2.7 billion dollars, and the price of one analysis exceeded $4,000. With the advent of AI, everything has become simpler, faster and cheaper. Now you can decode your genome for only $300. “ Affordable sequencing opens up new possibilities for personalized medicine. In the Holiverse metaverse, we plan to create a digital avatar that will help predict how training, nutrition, or medications will affect you before you start changing anything in your life ,” shares his plans Lado Okhotnikov , founder of the deep tech company. He is confident that this will help everyone understand their body better and manage it without wasting the most precious thing — time. The idea of ​​a digital avatar started with medicine. Genome sequencing, data analysis, and the use of AI made it possible to look at health from a different angle. But why limit yourself to just health? A digital avatar can become a universal tool that analyzes more than just the body. For example, it can help you choose a school for your child — with an emphasis on mathematics or the humanities. Lado Okhotnikov claims that a digital avatar can become your personal assistant. It can advise you how to allocate your time well, what to focus on, and what might be better to give up. And this is in no way a replacement for real life, but a tool that helps you make more accurate and informed decisions. If you doubt that such technology will ever come to our home, then remember how a couple of years ago most of us did not even hear of ChatGPT or similar models. And now millions of people use them, solving routine tasks in minutes that used to take half a day or more. Dara Ladjevardian “brings people to life” with one sentence Using Delphi, you can create a virtual reflection of anyone — yourself, a friend, or even a person who is no longer alive. To create your digital double, Delphi only needs four texts. These can be letters, instant messaging, YouTube videos, or even audio recordings. Based on them, the system will train AI that will write and speak exactly like you. Dara Ladjevardian, one of the founders of the company, says that thanks to a partnership with ElevenLabs, an expert in voice cloning, your chatbot will also be able to speak like you. However, opponents of AI panicked: what if soon we will completely stop understanding who is talking to us — a living person or their “avatar”, while the real one is lying in bed? In fact, the idea with a clone is cool, but this is not a visionary idea. Further, you will understand why we used this startup as an example. Sam Altman is a creator of the global human recognition system With the development of artificial intelligence, it is becoming increasingly difficult to understand who is a real person and who is a bot. Bots already can write texts, draw pictures, and deepfakes can fake faces and voices, as in the case of Delphi. World Network (formerly Worldcoin) wants to solve this problem by creating a database of verified people. The idea seems logical. Artificial intelligence is already creating a huge amount of content, and we need more tools to distinguish people from machines. Sam Altman in this case is a real visionary who not only came up with a system, but also managed to launch it and make the whole world talk about it. Few people are ready to come up with a proposal like, “ Let’s scan the irises of billions of people .” However, Sam really got down to it, as the problem of fakes has become more acute. How to become a visionary and what is a foresight session Let’s start with the fact that visionaries do not just fantasize. How to understand that your idea is not fiction? An idea solves a real or predictable problem. Remember how the growth of data volumes pushed the development of cloud computing. In 2014, Microsoft focused on remote servers, noticing that the demand for local servers was falling. This decision brought the company more than $60 billion in revenue. An idea is aimed at the future and offers long-term solutions. For example, quantum computing — for now it seems like science fiction, but it is already clear that it will revolutionize medicine, space exploration, cryptography. An idea is feasible. Even if your thoughts are too ambitious for today, it is important that there is at least a theoretical path to their implementation. Want something specific? Try a foresight session. A foresight session is a way to look into the future and understand how to get ready for it If you have a goal, for example, to develop a company strategy for several years ahead or find new business opportunities, here is how you can organize it. Gather a team and data First, determine what exactly you want to get. Strategy? Ideas for new products? Responses to market challenges? Then invite people with different experience: managers, analysts, experts from related fields. Prepare as much information as possible: data on trends, market reports, examples of successful cases, even expert forecasts. This will become the basis for discussions. Understand what influences the future of the company Start the discussion. What factors are already changing your industry? What may become key in 5 —10 years? These can be technologies, politics, ecology, economics, social trends. For example, for an IT company, this may be the development of AI, changes in customer demand, or the emergence of new competitors. Come up with scenarios for the future Now comes the most interesting part. Brainstorming: let everyone express their ideas about what the world may be like in 5, 10, 20 years. For example, if we talk about technologies: one scenario is that AI will automate almost everything, another is that human resistance will slow down its development. Both options need to be considered. How will the first one affect the labor market? How will the second one leave room for a person? Identify priorities When there are many ideas, they need to be organized. Which scenarios seem most probable? Which ones can bring the company the largest profit? For example, in 2007, Netflix organized a foresight session to understand how video viewing priorities would change. Trend analysis prompted them to switch from DVDs to streaming. Develop a strategy Based on the chosen scenario, create an action plan. For example, if the world is moving towards full automation, this could be training employees in new skills, implementing AI in business processes, or creating products using new technologies. Review the plan regularly The world is changing quickly, so the strategy needs to be updated. Periodic monitoring will help you stay flexible. Foresight sessions are not just a tool for predictions, but a real way to prepare a business for change. People who can look into the future and act ahead of the curve become visionaries and set trends while others are catching up.

And why not? The company’s obsession has helped push its market cap past $80 billion, even landing it a spot on the Nasdaq 100 Index. Oh, it has been an outstanding year for MicroStrategy. The company plans to raise $42 billion over the next three years by selling stock and issuing convertible debt. In just two months, it’s already hit two-thirds of that target. At this rate, they’ll likely smash through their capital goals well ahead of schedule. But here’s the twist: Hedge funds are jumping into the mix, using MicroStrategy’s convertible bonds for some financial acrobatics. They’re buying bonds and shorting the company’s shares, playing the volatility game and betting big on chaos. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy is asking shareholders for permission to issue more Class A common and preferred shares. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is consolidating near the bottom of its one-month range. December’s returns were a modest 4.8%, and January’s are shaping up to be similar at 3.3%. Ethereum did alright too, climbing 30% in Q4, while Bitcoin posted a solid 48% gain. But the current market is anything but exciting, and the numbers suggest things might stay quiet until February. Meanwhile, options traders are showing some interest in the long game. Calls for March are seeing strong demand, with a flurry of 120k-130k contracts bought just last week. But for now, the short-term market feels like it’s on pause.

Uniswap's UNI Token: Decentralized Exchange Governance and Liquidity Uniswap's UNI token, launched in September 2020, is a governance token that allows holders to participate in decision-making for the Uniswap platform, including fee structures and token distribution. Uniswap is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Ethereum blockchain, known for its automated liquidity protocol introduced in 2018, which enables trading without an order book and gives users full control of their funds. The UNI token was distributed to incentivize users and respond to competition, with 150 million tokens given to past users. Uniswap's open-source nature and focus on accessibility and security make it distinct from centralized exchanges. In the current market cycle, UNI's role in governance and the platform's significant assets underline its potential. Solana (SOL): A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability, providing a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps) alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. It emphasizes faster transactions and flexible development across multiple programming languages. SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, plays a central role in its ecosystem by facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. By avoiding sharding and second-layer solutions, Solana aims to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network capable of hosting high-activity products and services. Given its focus on performance and scalability, SOL has potential in the current market cycle for those interested in platforms that support fast and efficient decentralized applications. Fetch.ai: Decentralized AI Lab Revolutionizing Machine Learning Networks Fetch.ai (FET), founded in 2017 and launched via IEO on Binance in March 2019, is an artificial intelligence lab developing an open, permissionless, decentralized machine learning network within a crypto economy. It enables anyone to access secure datasets using autonomous AI agents to perform tasks leveraging its global data network. Rooted in use cases such as optimizing DeFi trading services, transportation networks, smart energy grids, and travel, Fetch.ai aims to enhance complex digital systems reliant on large-scale datasets. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, price predictions suggest potential growth for FET in the coming years, indicating possible gains compared to current prices. The coin's focus on democratizing AI technology positions it strategically in the evolving market. Arbitrum (ARB): Enhancing Ethereum with Layer-2 Scaling Arbitrum, developed by Offchain Labs, is a Layer-2 solution designed to improve Ethereum's transaction speed and reduce costs. It achieves this by using optimistic rollups, which make smart contracts more efficient. The ARB token is at the core of Arbitrum, serving as a governance token that lets holders vote on network decisions and participate in development. There are 10 billion ARB tokens initially, with a maximum yearly inflation rate of 2%. The tokens are distributed among investors, DAOs, individual wallets, a DAO Treasury, and the team. Arbitrum's technology has the potential to significantly enhance Ethereum's performance. In the current market cycle, ARB appears to be an attractive option due to its focus on scalability and user participation. Conclusion While UNI, SOL, FET, and ARB show less short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming for financial freedom for all. Offering a 700% ROI in presale, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016 over 14 stages, with triple utility features, Catzilla invites participation in the fight against crypto villains.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homosexual-pepe-homopepe-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-doge-crash/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

38311885,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376637,1735575529,ETH Outpaces BTC in Long-Term Holder Retention Throughout 2024: ITB,"Long-term holding trends in the crypto market have taken an intriguing turn this year as Ethereum surpassed Bitcoin in retaining such investors. Despite Bitcoin’s 122% surge compared to Ethereum’s 48% growth in the past year, the increase in the long-term holders of the latter highlighted rising market confidence as 2025 approaches. Ethereum Shows Stronger Long-Term Holder Retention According to IntoTheBlock data , the percentage of long-term Ether (ETH) holders has steadily surpassed that of Bitcoin (BTC) investors throughout 2024. The year-to-date trend indicates a declining share of long-term Bitcoin holders, which currently stands at a little over 62%. On the other hand, long-term ETH holders began the year with a notable rise, thereby outpacing their BTC counterparties early on and stabilizing at 75.06%. This divergence in investor behavior, with Ethereum seeing stronger retention among long-term participants compared to Bitcoin over the past year. This shift comes even as Ethereum didn’t hit its all-time high price like Bitcoin. However, it is important to note that the world’s largest altcoin saw plenty of other developments. For instance, spot Ether ETFs received approval , which sparked interest without driving a major price rally. Anthony Sassano, a leading Ethereum advocate and educator, projected that Ether ETFs could see net inflows exceeding $50 billion in 2025. In addition to making crypto a key part of his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump also supported the DeFi platform “World Liberty Financial,” which has been built on Ethereum. This reflects Ethereum being a strong contender in the DeFi space despite a flurry of alternatives. On the technology side of things, Ethereum became more affordable after the Dencun upgrade, which introduced proto-danksharding that involves slashing transaction fees across Layer 2 solutions to offer users faster and cheaper alternatives to the mainnet. Bitcoin in Accumulation Zone? Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment, dropped to 65 on December 30, the lowest since October 15, amid Bitcoin’s more than 12% decline to $93,000 over the past two weeks. After peaking at 94 in November, the index stayed above 70 through December, driven by optimism over pro-crypto US election results before the recent slump. However, the author James Williams asserted that Bitcoin has re-entered its accumulation zone, and a potential buildup phase could be ahead of a significant price move. The investor predicted a period of consolidation lasting a few weeks, which could pave the way for a breakout. With confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory, he forecasted a price of $131,500 or higher by Q1 2025, calling it “inevitable.” The post ETH Outpaces BTC in Long-Term Holder Retention Throughout 2024: ITB appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/eth-outpaces-btc-in-long-term-holder-retention-throughout-2024-itb/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/38311885.jpeg

Dogecoin's Rise: How a Meme Coin Became a Top Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) was launched in 2013 as a fun alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the ""Doge"" meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. In 2021, its value surged, driven by social media influence and support from figures like Elon Musk, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Dogecoin showcases the power of community and social media in shaping financial markets. Its potential lies in its strong community support and widespread recognition. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin's popularity may make it an attractive option for investors. XRP: A Fast and Borderless Cryptocurrency for Global Payments XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger, designed to be fast, low-cost, open, and resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. Operating on a decentralized system without a central authority, it enables irreversible and secure transactions without the need for a bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion coins, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple to support development. Ripple uses XRP to improve network liquidity and has placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control supply release. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across various currencies, enhancing efficiency in global financial transactions. Conclusion DOGE and XRP show limited short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, is expected to grow 700% by presale end, with potential thousand-fold returns. Following successful tokens like BONK and WIF, DOGEN is building a community of alpha leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

Similarly, businesses can rely on the dVPN to ensure secure remote operations, free from the prying eyes of centralised entities. Qubetics Presale: A Record-Breaking Run The Qubetics presale is a story of remarkable success. Now in its 14th stage, it has sold over 385 million $TICS tokens to more than 12,400 holders, raising $8.1 million so far. At a current price of $0.037, investors are snapping up tokens before the weekend’s 10% price hike. Investment Potential of $TICS Analysts predict that $TICS will reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a 630% ROI. With $100,000 invested now, you could secure approximately 2,923,970 $TICS tokens, which would be worth over $43.8 million if $TICS achieves its post-mainnet launch projection of $15 per token. Real-Life Applications of Decentralised VPN Beyond its investment appeal, Qubetics’ dVPN has practical applications for businesses, professionals, and individuals. For instance, a remote team spread across multiple countries can use the dVPN to collaborate securely without worrying about data breaches or surveillance. This level of security and transparency makes Qubetics a standout project in the blockchain space.

38311776,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/new-market-leader-why-nebula-stride-nst-will-turn-the-world-upside-down-in-2025,1735575200,New Market Leader: Why Nebula Stride (NST) Will Turn the World Upside Down in 2025?,"The DeFi industry continues to grow, but it is Nebula Stride (NST) that is attracting more and more attention today. And it's not just because of its impressive concept or bold promises: the project is already backed by an impressive army of investors, a well-thought-out ecosystem and real cases of interaction with the traditional financial world. Let's break down exactly why NST could be a game changer for the market by 2025 and why it makes sense to join the pre-sale now. A revolutionary solution for real assets What most often keeps large financial institutions and ordinary people from diving into the crypto world? First of all, it's the lack of a clear mechanism for linking tokens to real world assets (Real World Assets, or RWAs). Often blockchain projects remain only on paper, with no direct application in the offline economy. Nebula Stride solves this problem by offering tools to digitize real assets. Imagine real estate, gold or other valuables that can be tokenized and exchanged without intermediaries, avoiding unnecessary formalities. It is predicted that the RWA market could reach astronomical levels by 2030, and Nebula Stride is ready to lead the way today. Why Nebula Stride? 1. Multi-chain infrastructure. The project is initially built with support for the most popular networks: Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon and others. For investors and developers, this means freedom of action, lower commissions and no bottlenecks when transferring assets. 2. QuickMint Bot and NFT platform. Not everyone knows how to create and issue tokens or NFTs on their own. QuickMint Bot simplifies this process to a few clicks, which opens doors to new users and accelerates community growth. 3. Community and referral programs. The secret to any crypto startup's success is a strong fan base. Nebula Stride attracts 10,000 to 15,000 new members per day through referrals, incentivizing further development of the ecosystem and increasing the value of the token. 4. Reliability and Transparency. The company has been audited by CertiK, one of the leading players in cybersecurity for blockchain. This means that the project code has been checked for vulnerabilities and meets high requirements. All of these points add up to one coherent picture: Nebula Stride is building an infrastructure that provides real benefits to participants. Because of this, NST can become a long-term asset, not just a temporary trend. Prospects by 2025: a realistic scenario Some forecasts indicate that in 12-18 months the price of NST may reach $50, and by 2027 it may exceed the $100 mark. Of course, every investment decision comes with risks, but the Nebula Stride team is working hard to further develop technology and increase public trust, which reduces the likelihood of unfavorable scenarios. How to get started? The first step is to visit the official Nebula Stride website, where you can find all the necessary information about the project, the roadmap, partner programs and the current token price during the presale. There you can also find links to Telegram, Discord and other channels where users discuss the latest news and share their ideas. Be sure to check out the community: you will see that Nebula Stride brings together not just investors, but people who truly believe in the potential of decentralized finance and the real integration of blockchain into our daily lives.

But it is already obvious that Nebula Stride (NST) has a serious chance not only to gain a foothold in the market, but also to set new standards in the field of DeFi and tokenization of real assets. If you're ready to move with the emerging ecosystem, benefit from price appreciation, and participate in creating the future of finance, the NST presale could be the chance you don't want to miss. There is an era ahead of us in which projects that can combine traditional finance and blockchain technology will play a major role. And all indications are that Nebula Stride is poised to become one of those engines of progress that will be at the top of the rankings and on the lists of the most promising investments in 2025.

At this point, Foundry USA Pool attracted market attention by refunding the large amount of transaction fees that were mistakenly paid. BTC Block 875475 was mined on the Foundry USA Pool, where a user paid 8.18 BTC for a transaction, which is 91,127 times the required fee. The mining pool, which did not remain indifferent to this situation, reached out to the user and refunded the excess fee. Foundry USA Pool said in a statement that this refund does not affect payments for its regular customers and that its payment system does not take into account the three highest and three lowest transaction fees each day. “On December 19, Foundry USA Pool mined block 875475, which contained a Bitcoin transaction in which the user inadvertently paid a fee of 8.18 BTC, which was 91,127 times more than was required to be included in the block. Our Foundry team contacted the affected individual and after careful consideration, decided to refund the overage fee. We have received many messages from across the industry and would like to extend our thanks to everyone who reached out to us on behalf of their users. We would like to point out that this decision was made after a comprehensive evaluation and that we will continue to address such situations on a case-by-case basis.” This incident involving Foundry USA Pool is not an isolated incident in Bitcoin mining. It is the second such incident in recent months, following a similar incident in which Antpool was forced to refund $3 million worth of Bitcoin transaction fees after a user error led to the highest fee ever paid on the Bitcoin network in November 2023. Because in November 2023, another mining pool, Antpool, also returned the extraordinarily high transaction fee of 83.6 BTC, which was approximately $ 3.1 million at that time, to the user. *This is not investment advice.

This unexpected prediction has caught the attention of investors, stirring curiosity about the factors driving such optimistic projections. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win. 💎 HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market 💎 This thing is about to explode! We’re talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up — and that’s just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! ⚡️ Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? ⚡️ DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! 🚀 Cardano's ADA: A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, supporting the development of decentralized finance applications, tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, enables users to store value, make payments, and participate in network staking. Cardano uses the energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, setting it apart from energy-intensive proof-of-work models. The blockchain's dual-layer structure enhances transaction processing capabilities. Since the introduction of Cardano native tokens in 2021, it provides secure and low-fee interactions with smart contracts. The technology's focus on sustainability, scalability, and efficiency positions it as a significant player in the blockchain industry, potentially offering attractive features for users and developers in the current market. Polkadot (DOT): Connecting Blockchains for Enhanced Scalability and Interoperability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains without intermediaries. By using parachains, it enhances speed and scalability, processing transactions much faster than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Polkadot token (DOT) is used for governance and staking, allowing holders to participate in network development and transaction verification. Developed by Ethereum co-creator Gavin Wood and launched in May 2020, Polkadot aims to create a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem. Its technology holds potential for improving blockchain efficiency and interoperability. In the current market cycle, its focus on scalability and cross-chain functionality may attract interest from those looking for innovative blockchain solutions. Conclusion ADA and DOT show less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, is expected to grow 700% by presale's end, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

With ADA demonstrating resilience and a steady recovery, many investors are viewing it as a promising choice for portfolio diversification. However, the market’s true bright spot is 1Fuel OFT, whose presale is capturing the attention of early investors eager to secure the token at its initial price. 1Fuel OFT’s innovative DeFi featuresand robust market potential make it a top contender for the next crypto bull run. Bitcoin Experiences Shocking Drop Bitcoin has always been known as the best crypto to buy, and recently achieved a historic all-time high of $106,147 in December. But it has seen a sharp decline, causing unease among investors. The cryptocurrency has recovered 0.33% in the past 24 hours but is still down 2.32% in the past week, settling at $$94,778.67. This drop from its all time high has caused many investors to be concerned about whether Bitcoin would perform well in 2025. Analysts have projected that Bitcoin’s value would go as high as $180,000 by the end of 2025. Investors continue to manage Bitcoin and other altcoins in trusted platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. ADA Attracts Investor Spotlight Ahead of 2025 As Bitcoin dominance in the crypto market has reduced, Cardano has been drawing a lot of attention from investors that want promising opportunities. Recently, it finally achieved an all-time high of $1.231. Analysts have set varied price targets for the token, with conservative estimates around $4 and more optimistic forecasts reaching as high as $7. ADA’s prospects for 2025 are driven by the Hydra scaling solution and rising real-world adoption. Platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet make it easy for investors to manage and stake ADA alongside other tokens. But traders are also diverting their attention to some promising tokens in presale for the ever-changing crypto space. Investors Rush to Accumulate 1Fuel OFT in Presale As Bitcoin dominance wanes, investors are turning their attention to tokens in presale like 1Fuel OFT. The ongoing presale of 1Fuel has become a beacon of investor interest, with stage 2 already over 67% complete. In a remarkable show of demand, more than 90 million tokens have been sold in record time, raising over $900,000. 1Fuel stands out in the competitive altcoin market, primarily due to its innovative features embedded in its decentralized exchange (DEX) wallet. Unlike MetaMask and Trust Wallet, which often require multiple wallets and tokens for cross-chain transactions, 1Fuel offers a streamlined solution. Additionally, its inbuilt privacy mixer, cold storage options and crypto card for real-world payments, provide a comprehensive ecosystem for digital asset management. These advanced functionalities, combined with its promise of 1000% growth upon listing in 2025, position 1Fuel OFT as the best crypto to buy. 1Fuel is expected to change the way DEX wallets are used, especially since it offers more advanced features like cross-chain swaps and inbuilt privacy mixers. These are features that are not currently offered by traditional wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. 1Fuel is expected to lead the next wave of cryptocurrency innovation. Crypto Market to Experience Major Shifts The crypto market is expected to experience major changes in 2025, especially with the public listing of the 1Fuel OFT token. Its live presale is attracting widespread investor interest, especially as analysts expect the value to rise by 1000% in the next bull run.

It uses an object-centric data model and the Move programming language to improve upon existing blockchain systems. Sui focuses on user experience by removing common barriers in blockchain interactions. Innovations like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks make applications on Sui accessible and easy to use. The combination of technical advancements and user-friendly features gives Sui potential in the blockchain space. In the current market cycle, Sui's approach to scalability and usability may make it an attractive option for developers and users seeking an efficient blockchain platform. JasmyCoin (JASMY): Empowering Data Sovereignty in the IoT Era JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency developed by Jasmy Corporation, a Tokyo-based Internet of Things (IoT) provider focused on data transactions. The platform integrates IoT and blockchain technologies to restore and protect individual data sovereignty, giving users full control over their personal information. By connecting service providers and data users, Jasmy enables secure, trustless data exchange between IoT devices such as computers, cars, and phones. The system utilizes edge computing and stores data on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), decentralizing workflows and transforming user information into personal assets. Jasmy offers a robust infrastructure and intuitive interface, aiming to facilitate safe and efficient data sharing, which holds significant potential in the evolving digital economy. Stellar (XLM): Enhancing Global Finance through Decentralized Payments Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized, open-source payments network that uses blockchain technology to enable quick and low-cost fund transfers. It does not favor any national currency and features its own cryptocurrency, Stellar Lumens. Since its inception in 2014, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and formed partnerships with major companies. It stands out by allowing transfers of any currency type, including digital versions of national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike some cryptocurrencies that aim to replace financial systems, Stellar seeks to enhance them by offering a unified network for collaboration. Individuals can transfer funds globally using Stellar apps, and companies can build blockchain applications or use the network for payments and currency conversion. Given its unique approach and collaborations, Stellar's technology has significant potential in the current market cycle. Terra Classic (LUNC): A Blockchain for Stable Global Payments Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain protocol that uses stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies to enable price-stable global payments. It combines the stability of traditional currencies with the censorship-resistant features of cryptocurrencies. The original Terra chain, launched in April 2019, was rebranded as Terra Classic after a new chain was created in May 2022. The native token LUNA became LUNA Classic (LUNC), and the stablecoins were renamed accordingly. Terra Classic aims to offer fast and affordable settlements. Its potential lies in facilitating global transactions with minimal volatility. In the current market cycle, the attractiveness of LUNC depends on its adoption and real-world use cases. Conclusion SUI, JASMY, XLM, and LUNC have less short-term potential. DOGEN, for those seeking the best in life, embodies luxury and success. Expected 700% growth by presale end, with potential thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. DOGEN builds a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits like exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

Imagine that investors of established projects like Solana and Cardano know about this new altcoin and are jumping on it. Now imagine that this next big crypto token is still available, and you can get it, but only for a limited time. You’d jump on it too, right? Well, so will many other investors. This article introduces Remittix, explains its growing stature, and why no savvy investor who knows about it should miss out on it. Why Remittix is a crypto investor magnet Remittix is a PayFi crypto solution. This means that it makes crypto payments smooth and easy. But Remittix is not just any other crypto payment solution; it is intertwined with innovation that is taking it to the top of the PayFi industry. Specifically, Remittix allows anyone to send fiat to any bank account in the world via their crypto wallet. It takes the cryptocurrency in your wallet, converts it to fiat, and then sends it to any bank account across the globe via local payment networks. This is a groundbreaking use case that crypto enthusiasts have been yearning for. Apart from banking the unbanked, it fosters genuine adoption of cryptocurrencies and takes it to the next level. Unlike the dinosaurs of cross-border remittances, Remittix is fast, secure, and cheap. There’s a flat fee for each transaction and no FX costs or any other hidden charges. For the crypto investor, Remittix offers staking rewards up to 30% APY. There’s also a competition where ten winners will each claim $25,000 in USDT, and there are other numerous mouth-watering incentives for participating in the Remittix community. This new altcoin is destined to be a crypto bigwig, and it is set to rally explosively on its way to the top. Solana keeps struggling post crypto liquidations A few weeks ago, the crypto market crashed, and coins like Solana are still reeling from the aftershock. Trading above $240 before the price correction, SOL is now around the $180 price level. Even worse, Solana hasn’t had a tangible resurgence since the drop, causing SOL holders to start worrying about its future. Solana remains a massive crypto project and could rise again. But ambitious investors are already jumping ship and leaving Solana. For these guys, Remittix is a worthy option, and most of them are taking the plunge. Resilient Cardano succumbs to market pressure Like Solana, Cardano also shed a significant portion of its value after the market crashed. However, ADA has been resilient- up to the last fortnight at least. Dropping from $1.3, ADA is now trading around $0.8, which isn’t so bad in relation to other coins. Nevertheless, there are several wantaway ADA investors as well. Cardano hasn’t had a decent performance in the last half of December, and with the way things are, it is more likely to drop further. Don’t miss out on the next big crypto Apart from being a surging star, RTX offers bigger potential than Solana and Cardano. It also has a more attractive entry-level price of $0.0167. Given that RTX is set to fetch early investors a profit of 10,000% joining its roaring presale seems like a no-brainer.

38311621,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634868,1735574457,Rising Treasury yields are the biggest challenge to Trump’s bull market,"Wall Street investors hoping for a traditional Santa Rally to close out the year have been left disappointed so far. Stock index futures suggest continued struggles for equities, following a 1.1% drop in the S&P 500 at the end of last week. According to economists, 2024 has been a record-setting year for Wall Street. The S&P 500 reached 57 record highs, placing it among the top five years for all-time records. Over the past year, the Nasdaq Composite has gained over 31%, the S&P 500 has climbed 25%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen a more modest 14%. However, rising bond yields are presenting challenges for equities. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield closed last week at its highest level in seven months. Since September, yields have jumped nearly a full percentage point, even after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate. Treasury yields could pressure stocks Analysts attribute the rising bond yields to concerns over President-elect Donald Trump’s tariff and tax policies. These policies could fuel inflation and expand the federal deficit, increasing bond supply and suppressing prices. Julian Emanuel, a strategist at Evercore ISI, warns that long-term yields could continue to exert medium-term pressure on equities, even if broader economic conditions remain favorable. “ Rising long-term bond yields pose the biggest challenge to the bull market as 2025 begins ,” Emanuel wrote in a recent note, pointing to increased equity market volatility following the Federal Reserve’s December meeting. The bond market is reaching a peak while the crude oil market finds a bottom, both driven largely by inflation. Bitcoin positions itself as a key player due to its decentralized nature and limited supply, offering an alternative to the depreciation of traditional assets. As… — GG (@LuillyDRR) December 27, 2024 Emanuel emphasized that while bond yields may pull back slightly in the short term due to elevated Treasury short positions and easing geopolitical tensions, the medium-term outlook remains challenging. The interplay between rising bond yields and equity valuations will be crucial in determining market trends in early 2025. The strategist also predicts that a 10-year Treasury yield of 4.5% is manageable for equities, but a breach of 4.75% could trigger a deeper correction. Notably, stocks have shown resilience in periods of rising yields, advancing 117% since the bond market trough in 2020. However, during periods when yields surpassed 4.5% or 4.75%, equities posted negative returns of -2.1% and -3.7%, respectively. Corporate earnings bolstered by economic resilience In 2024, earnings growth extended beyond the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants, with the other 493 S&P 500 companies exiting their earnings recession. According to FactSet data, S&P 500 earnings are projected to grow 15% year over year in 2025. Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist, notes that this earnings growth will likely sustain the bull market. “ The weight of evidence suggests the primary market trend remains higher, driven by earnings growth in 2025, ” Lerner stated in his market outlook. The broader U.S. economy has also demonstrated resilience. November retail sales exceeded expectations, GDP growth remains above trend at 3%, and the unemployment rate continues to hover around 4%. While still elevated, inflation has shown signs of moderation, giving investors hope for a “soft landing” where prices stabilize without significant job losses. Market tailwinds and headwinds into 2025 Several tailwinds are supporting market optimism heading into 2025. Record corporate profits are expected for a second consecutive year, with net profit margins projected to remain nearly 12%. Sectors beyond technology, including health care, industrials, and materials, are anticipated to see profit increases in the high teens. However, headwinds are where economists are expressing little to no optimism. Federal Reserve officials now project the federal funds rate to fall to 3.9% in 2025, an increase from their earlier September estimate of 3.4%. While the Fed delivered a substantial 50 basis point rate cut in September, most adjustments over the past year have been in smaller 25 basis point increments. The latest projections suggest the central bank anticipates two more rate cuts in 2025, down from the four cuts previously forecast in September. BREAKING: Fed projections imply 50 basis points of rate cuts in 2025, another 50 bps in 2026. — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) December 18, 2024 If interest rates are not accordingly cut in 2025, given the Federal Reserve’s commitment to combating inflation, it may risk a policy error that could potentially harm the labor market. Additionally, analysts reckon that the Trump administration’s policies , while business-friendly, could introduce growth challenges through higher tariffs. Tech stocks, which have driven much of the market’s gains, face potential stagnation as investors grow wary of excessive spending on artificial intelligence without corresponding earnings growth. While a collapse in tech valuations is unlikely, a moderation in valuations could shift investor focus toward undervalued sectors like health care and materials.

Solana's SOL: A Scalable Blockchain Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability, providing a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps) alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. It stands out with architectural choices aimed at faster transactions and flexible development across multiple programming languages. SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network supporters. Unlike some platforms, Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability, aiming to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network capable of hosting high-activity products and services. The potential of SOL lies in its role underpinning this scalable ecosystem, and its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on individual investment strategies and market conditions. Toncoin (TON): Native Cryptocurrency Empowering The Open Network Ecosystem Toncoin (TON) is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized and open-source layer-1 blockchain. Originally developed by Telegram as the Telegram Open Network with the 'Gram' token, the project is now led by the TON Foundation after Telegram discontinued it in 2020. Toncoin utilizes a proof-of-stake consensus model, enhancing network scalability and reliability. It aims to offer fast, secure payment services with minimal fees and to develop a comprehensive ecosystem that includes decentralized storage, services, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. Based on historical price movements and Bitcoin halving cycles, Toncoin's price could reach $30.30 by 2025 and $26.04 by 2030. The coin's technological potential and growth projections suggest it may be attractive in the current market cycle. Aptos (APT): A Scalable Blockchain for High-Speed Web3 Applications Aptos (APT) is a new layer-one blockchain designed to be scalable, safe, reliable, and upgradable. Launched by Aptos Labs, founded by core contributors from Diem (a Meta initiative), it aims to address high transaction fees and network congestion seen in blockchains like Ethereum before its shift to Proof-of-Stake. Aptos uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism and the Move programming language for smart contracts, focusing on safety and flexibility. It supports a wide range of Web3 applications. In the current market cycle, Aptos's focus on scalability and its strong development team make it an attractive option for developers and investors interested in high-speed blockchain technologies. Conclusion With the bull run here, SOL, TON, and APT may have less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, expects 700% growth by presale's end and potential for huge returns this alt season. Following successful tokens like BONK, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

Here's How High It Could Go This Bull Run,"Dogecoin (DOGE) might experience a breakout in the next bull run, and some analysts think it'll reach $1 by 2025. Renewed whale activity, improved network engagement, and bullish chart signals boost optimism for DOGE's value trajectory. As market sentiment shifts, Dogecoin again proves its staying power in the altcoin space. Could this meme coin achieve new heights and outperform expectations? Let’s dive into the possibilities. Rollblock Set for Another Price Increase Before New Year’s Day Rollblock (RBLK) is emerging as the most anticipated DeFi altcoin in 2025. Rollblock has launched the first decentralized gaming platform by introducing cutting-edge blockchain technology to online gaming, attracting significant attention. The project’s presale has already raised over $7.7 million, showcasing strong investor confidence in RBLK’s potential. Rollblock distinguishes itself by combining blockchain transparency with excitement. The platform has passed a SolidProof audit and secured an e-gaming license from Gaming Anjouan, underscoring its commitment to security. The platform encrypts all financial data and processes bets on-chain, protecting users from fraud and manipulation. Users can join Rollblock by signing up with an email, purchasing RBLK tokens with compatible cryptocurrencies, and accessing its casino games. The platform boasts over 7,000 AI-driven casino games, including classics and innovative Web3 titles like KENO and Max Car Racing. A major draw for investors is Rollblock’s plan to transform the $450 billion gambling market by sharing up to 30% of weekly casino profits with RBLK holders. The platform will use these profits to buy back tokens, increasing the price. Of the purchased tokens, 60% will be burned to create scarcity, while 40% will be distributed to stakers, offering APYs of 30% or more. Currently, RBLK tokens are available for $0.044 in stage 9 of the presale. Analysts predict another price jump by New Year’s Day. With expectations of delivering 880% returns to early investors, Rollblock is set to dominate the DeFi space and redefine online gaming before its launch in Q1 2025. Dogecoin Poised to Reach the $1 Price Mark Soon Dogecoin’s price dropped 22.41% on Friday amid intensive selling activity. However, bullish signals appear on its chart, suggesting an upward trend. Whale interest in Dogecoin has spiked, as large transactions have surged by 41% during the last 24 hours. Currently, Dogecoin is priced at $0.316, reflecting a 2.68% intraday gain—the memecoin trades above its 100-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages, showing positive momentum. The growing optimism has boosted Dogecoin’s network activity, pushing Open Interest beyond $2 million. Despite a slight intraday dip of 1.85%, bringing the price to $0.3287, analysts remain confident that Dogecoin could soon reach the $1 mark. Dogecoin’s appeal this altcoin season is driven by whale activity. Recently, whales purchased 250 million DOGE, worth $80 million, signaling strong confidence in Dogecoin’s potential. Such large-scale investments often indicate a belief in long-term growth, making Dogecoin a focal point for investors. Rollblock to Surpass Dogecoin Soon Analysts believe Dogecoin is preparing for a significant rally, likely outpacing most memecoinsin gains. Meanwhile, Rollblock is gaining attention as a potential competitor, poised to surpass Dogecoin. Rollblock’s blockchain-powered GameFi project combines real utility with scalability, offering investors a compelling alternative with long-term growth prospects.

Priced at just $0.004 during its presale phase , Lightchain AI is gaining traction as analysts forecast a 19,000% surge in its value. Unlike meme coins, which rely heavily on hype, Lightchain AI offers a unique combination of blockchain technology and practical utility in real-world industries. Shift From Meme Coins to Utility-Driven Tokens Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have been at the forefront of speculative trading, delivering massive gains during bullish phases. However, their reliance on community-driven hype and limited utility has led many investors to seek alternatives with stronger fundamentals. This shift has paved the way for the rise of tokens like Lightchain AI, which emphasize tangible value and sustainable growth. Lightchain AI addresses critical challenges in sectors such as supply chain, healthcare, and finance, offering real-world solutions that go beyond the speculative appeal of meme coins. For SHIB and DOGE holders, Lightchain AI represents an opportunity to diversify into a project with high-growth potential and practical applications. Why Lightchain AI Is Capturing Investor Interest Lightchain AI is revolutionizing the industry by merging AI and blockchain to redefine decentralized applications and governance. What truly sets it apart are its standout features, starting with the Memecoin Launchpad, which fosters creativity by providing a secure, AI-driven platform for developers and creators to monetize their ideas and drive a thriving ecosystem. Its pioneering technical architecture includes an Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) for seamless AI model training and inference, and a Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism that secures the network while rewarding nodes for performing AI computations. Lightchain AI also delivers unmatched scalability through sharding and Layer 2 solutions, ensuring high-speed AI tasks. Additionally, it prioritizes privacy with Zero-Knowledge Proofs and homomorphic encryption, enabling secure, confidential data computations for developers and users alike. Will Lightchain AI Deliver the Next Big Surge? The transition from hype-driven tokens like DOGE and SHIB to utility-focused projects reflects a maturing market. Lightchain AI is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this trend, offering investors a token with real-world relevance and high-growth potential. With over $6.28 million already raised, the presale phase has demonstrated strong market interest, setting the stage for explosive growth. For investors who missed out on Dogecoin and Shiba Inu’s initial rallies, Lightchain AI presents an opportunity to ride the next big wave in crypto. Its focus on RWAs and blockchain innovation ensures that it not only captures speculative interest but also delivers long-term value. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Moreover, active miners can continue holding or convert their tokens into fiat. Developers postponed the Pi mainnet launch from the earlier planned December 2024. The team delayed the launch for more users to complete the KYC verification and send their assets to mainnet. While the platform has KYC’d more than 18 million users, only 8 million have migrated their coins. Developers believe launching the mainnet without around 10 million pioneers is unfair. The project updated the grace period to January 31, 2025. Thus, enthusiasts can expect the mainnet launch in February. Nevertheless, the project has dented user enthusiasm with its deferments. The community was annoyed after the recent delay cemented speculations that the launch may not happen soon.

Chart by Coinmarketcap The daily timeframe reflects notable bearishness after the token approached $100 in November. Despite the bloodbath, PI’s price sways beyond an upward trendline. That shows sellers refraining from more shorts beneath the support zone. Moreover, the altcoin has secured reliable footing beyond the crucial 200-day EMA. PI appears well-suited for steady surges once stars align. The prevailing consolidation possibly highlights accumulation trends similar to what preceded November gains. The upcoming mainnet launch remains the top catalyst for PI’s price recovery. Bullishness amidst the hype might propel the altcoin towards the $100 resistance. Overcoming this hurdle could see buyers driving prices to the 2024 highs of $121. That would translate to a 147% surge from the current price.

Shiba Inu (SHIB), a leading meme coin with a strong community, and Lightchain AI (LCAI) , a cutting-edge blockchain project blending artificial intelligence, are emerging as top contenders for investment. While Shiba Inu is known for its viral appeal and established popularity, Lightchain AI offers advanced technological innovation that could redefine the blockchain landscape. With Lightchain AI currently priced at just $0.0045 during its presale and raising over $6.28 million, investors are weighing the potential of these tokens in vastly different market segments. Let’s dive into what each has to offer. Shiba Inu Community-Driven Growth with Volatility Shiba Inu has carved a niche in the crypto space as one of the most recognized meme coins. Its success stems largely from its loyal community, the ShibArmy, which has fueled adoption and market activity. The development of the ShibaSwap DEX and upcoming projects in the Shiba Inu ecosystem show that SHIB is moving beyond its meme origins to build real-world utility. However, Shiba Inu’s growth is tied heavily to market sentiment and speculative trading. While whales have rotated funds into SHIB in the past, the token’s extreme volatility remains a double-edged sword. For investors, SHIB presents an opportunity for short-term gains during bull markets, but it lacks the technological fundamentals to compete with utility-focused projects like Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI Game-Changer for Blockchain and AI Lightchain AI introduces an innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, where nodes are rewarded for executing AI computations such as model training and optimization. This novel approach not only enhances network security but also improves efficiency, setting it apart from traditional consensus methods. The project's comprehensive roadmap outlines significant milestones, including a testnet launch in January 2025 and mainnet activation in March 2025, showcasing a clear commitment to growth and scalability. With 10 billion LCAI tokens, the robust tokenomics ensure sustainability, allocating 40% for presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, and the remainder distributed among liquidity, marketing, treasury, and the team. By integrating AI with blockchain, Lightchain AI addresses scalability, governance, and privacy, paving the way for real-world applications and positioning itself as a leader in decentralized intelligence. Decentralized Governance as a Catalyst One of the standout aspects of Lightchain AI is its community-driven governance model. Unlike Solana, which relies heavily on developer-focused tools, Lightchain AI emphasizes inclusivity by allowing token holders to participate directly in platform decision-making. Through its decentralized governance framework: Token holders can vote on critical decisions, such as network updates, partnerships, and ecosystem direction. The platform employs quadratic voting, ensuring fairness by amplifying smaller stakeholders' influence while discouraging centralized control. Community initiatives, such as developer grants and public-funded AI projects, are funded directly through governance mechanisms, enhancing inclusivity and innovation. This governance approach ensures that Lightchain AI evolves in alignment with the collective goals of its community, giving it a unique edge compared to Solana’s more centralized development strategy. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This decline was in sync with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which have shed billions in value this month. In an X post, Michael van de Poppe, a prominent crypto pundit with over 748,000 followers on X, said that Chainlink’s uptrend had just begun.

It has moved to the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level and fallen below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average. Most notably, Chainlink price has formed a head and shoulders pattern, a common reversal signal. The current price is at the neckline of the H&S chart pattern. Historically, this formation often precedes further downside movement. As a result, the coin may continue to decline, with sellers targeting the next key support at $18, the 61.8% retracement point. A move below this level could push LINK to the psychological support level at $15. While Chainlink’s outlook for 2025 may remain bullish, its performance will largely depend on the overall trajectory of the crypto industry.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI.

In a market where efficiency and scalability are increasingly important, Starknet’s approach sets it apart from traditional solutions. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, projects like Starknet highlight the potential for more streamlined and cost-effective transactions, making them noteworthy developments in the current market landscape. Worldcoin (WLD) Worldcoin (WLD) is a bold project aiming to reshape digital identity and promote financial inclusion worldwide. Launched in 2023 and co-founded by Sam Altman, it uses AI and biometric technology—specifically eye scans—to create unique, secure digital IDs. By leveraging the innovative Orb device for iris-based identity verification, Worldcoin seeks to provide fair wealth distribution and universal access to the digital economy. With over two million users already onboard and plans to value the token at $3 billion, it’s positioning itself as a major player in the crypto space. Worldcoin’s potential lies in its ambitious vision of an inclusive digital economy supported by cutting-edge technology. The fixed supply of 10 billion WLD tokens suggests a model aiming for stability and widespread adoption. While privacy concerns over biometric data use have led to investigations in several countries, the surge in WLD’s value reflects strong market interest. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Worldcoin’s focus on identity verification and financial inclusion sets it apart. In the current market cycle, as digital identity becomes increasingly important, WLD offers a unique proposition that could attract those looking for innovation in the crypto world. Dymension (DYM) Dymension (DYM) is making waves with a new approach to blockchain technology. It offers a modular platform where developers can create and launch their own specialized Layer 2 rollups, known as RollApps. These RollApps aim to make transactions faster, cheaper, and more flexible. By building on the Cosmos SDK and using the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, Dymension ensures its platform can work smoothly with other blockchains. This focus on interoperability sets it apart and helps connect different blockchain networks. Despite entering a crowded field, Dymension has caught attention with a big move: a 70 million DYM token airdrop. This shows strong initial interest and could boost its user base. However, for Dymension to succeed, it needs more developers to build on its platform and a broader community to adopt it. Compared to other coins, Dymension’s innovative take on rollup technology and its use of the Cosmos framework give it an edge. In the current market, where scalability and interoperability are key trends, Dymension looks promising. Its unique approach could help it stand out and grow in the evolving blockchain landscape. Conclusion HFT, STRK, WLD, and DYM are strong low-cap projects with significant potential in the unfolding 2024 bull run.

Solana’s appeal explored Looking to capitalize on altcoin season? Get into Rollblock before NYE! A contentious topic within cryptocurrency is when the cycle top will occur in 2025. While 4-year cycle traditionalists believe that the market will peak around Q4 2025, others are more cautious, purporting an April-May top, based on a careful analysis of previous cycles, market psychology, and the current trajectory of this cycle. Regardless, the best course of action is to sell incrementally cryptocurrencies like Solana on the way up to secure gains preceding the bear run. To maximize gains in this bull run, low-cap gems in trendy sectors such as Rollblock present the best opportunities for amassing returns in the 50-100x zone. Read on to learn more about RBLK’s lucrative potential. Ready to capitalize on iGaming’s growing demand: Why Rollblock could become the next 100x gem Rollblock is transforming iGaming with its unique play-to-earn platform, blending traditional and blockchain gaming for a rewarding user experience. Certified by SolidProof and licensed by Anjouan Gaming, the platform is poised for growth as gaming cryptocurrencies gain momentum in the next bull cycle.

38310812,https://finbold.com/?p=224233,1735573187,"SOL could surge as Solana absorbs $400 million stablecoins in a week, Ethereum loses millions","Solana ( SOL ) continues in an impressive growth, attracting significant capital and users’ interest as 2024 ends and 2025 approaches. This week, for example, the Solana ecosystem had nearly half-a-billion dollar in stablecoins ’ inflow, while the Ethereum ecosystem lost millions. In particular, Solana had a $424.87 million inflow of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC in the last seven days. According to data from Lookonchain , this was the largest stablecoins inflow in all blockchains, with Coinbase ’s Base in second. This marks a huge milestone for Solana that could boost its ecosystem and SOL’s price to new highs. Essentially, stablecoins inflow usually mean increased demand for the ecosystem and increased liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. All that gets even more relevant when comparing to how other chains performed in the same period. Lookonchain consolidated that data, in a one-week time frame from December 30, 2024, comparing the top 15 blockchains. Stablecoins (USDT & USDC) change (7D) of top 15 chains. Source: Lookonchain Ethereum and other blockchains’ stablecoins net flow Base, Polygon ( POL ), Optimism ( OP ), Noble, and Aptos ( APT ) joined Solana with a positive seven-day stablecoin net flow. They absorbed $75 million, $35.2 million, $15.29 million, $8.15 million, and $3.45 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Arbitrum ( ARB ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), and Ethereum ( ETH ), led the top 15 chains with significant outflows of USDT and USDC. They lost $206 million, $67.13 million, and $63 million in stablecoins, respectively, with the Ethereum ecosystem being highly affected. Mantle Network ( MNT ), Sui Network ( SUI ), The Open Network ( TON ), Near Protocol ( NEAR ), Fantom ( FTM ), and the BNB Chain ( BNB ) joined the ranks although with more balanced flows going from minus $19.35 million to minus $0.29 million, in order. Interestingly, however, the Ethereum ecosystem continues leading in stablecoin liquidity, with over $111.59 billion, according to data from DefiLlama . This is a significantly high liquidity when compared to the $68 billion in total value locked (TVL) across Ethereum protocols. On the other hand, Solana currently has $5.23 billion in stablecoins, with $8.56 billion in TVL. If the trend of the last seven days continue, Solana could fight for the third position in stables, surpassing BNB and Arbitrum. Binance ’s smart chain currently has $6.82 billion in stablecoins, while Arbitrum has $6.75 billion. Blockchains TVL and stablecoin liquidity. Source: DefiLlama Solana (SOL) price analysis As of this writing, SOL, Solana’s native token, trades at $187.69, up 3.54% in the last seven days. This price surge is similar to Solana’s 4.95% TVL increase in the same period. Yet, it still lags behind the weekly 8.20% increase in stablecoin liquidity that Finbold reported. Moreover, SOL price briefly traded above $200 earlier in this analyzed last seven days. An upward potential of around 6.5% considering this local top alone. Solana (SOL) one-week (7D) price chart. Source: Finbold Therefore, while stablecoins inflow does not guarantee an immediate and proportional price surge, it could strengthen its growth potential. USDT and USDC entering Solana’s ecosystem while leaving others like Ethereum’s is an indicator worth considering and watching. Furthermore, this inflow could, not only benefit SOL, but also be distributed among the entire Solana ecosystem, while also shows a user’s preference in using stablecoins via the Solana blockchain, known for having faster finality and lower fees than Ethereum. Nevertheless, trading and investing in cryptocurrencies has inherent risks and unpredictability, requiring caution despite the positive indicators. SOL price could go both up or down in the following days as the year-end’s expected volatility plays its role.

A shift to DeFi lending and DEX activities is driving the trend. Solana (SOL) is setting out as one of the most active chains for 2024. Solana saw increased stablecoin inflows in the last days of the year, surpassing all other chains. Based on data by Lookonchain, Solana attracted more than $454M in stablecoin inflows in the past week. Methods for tracking inflows differ, but the overall trend is for more active bridging of stablecoins into Solana’s apps and lending pools. Solana also surpassed Base despite the recent rush to AI agent tokens. Stablecoin flows can shift depending on the available earnings potential of various chains. Arbitrum, formerly one of the key L2 chains, saw the biggest stablecoin outflows. Solana was the day’s leader in stablecoin inflows, tapping the expanded liquidity in 2024. | Source: Artemis Despite the L2 narrative, not all chains managed to attract value in the year to date. Former DeFi star ZKSync Era saw an outflow of more than $2B net, along with Linea, Blast, and Avalanche. On a year-to-date basis, stablecoins have boosted Optimism, Base, Solana, Arbitrum, and SUI. Ethereum remained the most active chain in hosting USDT, adding to the available liquidity. Overall, stablecoins crossed the $200B barrier, driven by Tether, in addition to new mints for DAI, USDS, and Ethena’s USDe. Ethereum remains a stablecoin donor, traffic shifted to Solana and Base Stablecoin flows shift in the short term, and Solana achieved its leading position as of December 30. The chain saw $8.8M in netflows for the day, followed by SUI’s $2.9M in netflows. Solana competes with Base for fund inflows, though it has only made second place for the past three months. In the year to date, Base remains the most significant target for stablecoin inflows. For 2024, the chain attracted $7.8B in inflows, with $3.5B retained as net inflows. Solana attracted $5.3B in new inflows while retaining $2.1B in net flows for the year to date. The chain recently added more than 100M USDS from the Sky ecosystem as it aims to expand DeFi lending. As a result, Solana carries $5.254B in bridged stablecoins, with a total value locked rising to $8.58B. Solana lagged in attracting value, only peaking in December at above $9B in various tokens and stablecoins. Jito Liquid Staking and Kamino Finance made the bulk of value locked, but DEX, like Raydium and Jupiter, also drew in $4.47B in their liquidity pairs. Stablecoin flows measure bridging activity , which varied depending on the available apps. Arbitrum was one of the EVM-compatible chains with highly active bridging. For Solana, the bridging from Ethereum was more rare, but once funds were sent to Solana, they were more likely to stay. Arbitrum, on the other hand, had a much more active turnover. The recent trend in stablecoin flows shows that trader expectations have shifted in the year to date. The trend accelerated as Solana and Base became the top chains that carried AI agent tokens. As the only source for those tokens, bridging stablecoins for trading was key to accessing the new markets. Solana activity moved from memes to DeFi Meme tokens were one of the main drivers of growth on Solana in the past months, with two significant series of expansion. Despite this, not all traffic on Solana was of the same quality. The chain carried multiple low-value transactions, with up to 35% transaction failures. In the past year, Solana was also the leader in carrying out trading bot activity. Routing and bot usage were key for Solana to ensure a successful DEX trade or token sniping. Up to 86% of all bot traders use Solana as their destination chain. Most of the Solana traffic is also from wallets with 0.01 SOL as a balance. However, the inflow of stablecoin activity shows value is also accrued, usually linked to whale wallets using the protocols. Solana’s lending expansion also hinged on meme tokens. Some leading memes, such as DogWifHat (WIF) , were used as collateral on Kamino to borrow more stablecoins.

Unlike Uniswap (UNI) and Cardano (ADA), which have established themselves in DeFi and blockchain innovation respectively, Lightchain AI leverages its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) to drive demand for its LCAI token. With its presale generating buzz and a focus on incentivizing decentralized AI contributions, can Lightchain AI’s tokenomics outperform UNI and ADA in the next market surge? Let’s explore its potential. Innovative Tokenomics Structure of Lightchain AI Lightchain AI's money plan is made to keep things going, share fairly, and have worth over a long time for its system. The full supply of LCAI tokens is set at 10 billion with 40 percent given to the presale. This presale split which͏ adds up to 4 billion tokens is for pay platform growth and thanking first fans. Also, 28 point five percent of tokens (2 85 billion is set aside for reward from staking, urging network validators and users to boost safety and work better through active staking. To keep easy trades and cut down on slip in decentralized shops, 15% of supply (1.5 billion tokens) goes to the liquid fund. Ads and teamwork are also key, with 5% (500 million tokens) used for sharing news about the platform and making big deals to grow world view. At the same time, 6.5% (650 million tokens) is saved in a treasure fund for future work, costs to run things, and projects from community members making sure the platform can last long term. The remaining 5% (500 million tokens) is allocated to the core team and contributors, with vesting schedules in place to align their incentives with Lightchain AI's long-term growth. This carefully planned allocation strategy supports early adoption, rewards active participation, and provides the necessary resources to drive ongoing development and promotion. Together, these measures create a balanced, value-driven ecosystem designed for success. Comparing Lightchain AI's Token Utility with UNI and ADA Lightchain AI's LCAI token serves multiple functions within its ecosystem, enhancing its utility compared to tokens like Uniswap's UNI and Cardano's ADA. LCAI is used for payments in AI services, enabling users to access model training and inference through the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Additionally, LCAI holders can stake tokens to participate in decentralized governance, influencing protocol updates and ecosystem developments. In contrast, UNI primarily functions as a governance token for the Uniswap platform, allowing holders to vote on proposals but lacking broader utility. ADA, the native token of Cardano, is used for transaction fees and staking rewards, contributing to network security and stability. However, it does not offer specialized utilities like AI service payments. Therefore, LCAI's diverse applications in AI integration and governance provide a more comprehensive utility framework compared to UNI and ADA. How Lightchain AI Could Outperform in the Upcoming Bull Run Lightchain AI (LCAI) is poised to outperform in the upcoming bull run due to its innovative integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, enhancing network efficiency and security. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables seamless execution of AI-specific tasks, fostering the development of intelligent decentralized applications across various industries. Analysts predict that LCAI could experience significant price growth, with some forecasts indicating a potential rise to $10 by 2025, offering substantial returns for early investors. This combination of technological innovation and market potential positions Lightchain AI as a strong contender in the next market rally.

42389412,555b5ae6-24c3-4fcb-95e1-a9f03465164d,1735572731,Sell the News: MicroStrategy Plunge Deepens in Days Following Nasdaq-100 Inclusion,"In retrospect, it was inevitable.  Down more than 8% and holding just above $300 on Monday, MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares are now lower by about 30% since just after the announcement of their inclusion into the Nasdaq-100 index and nearly 50% from their late November record high.  The signs of at least a major short-term top in one-time barely known enterprise software company turned juggernaut Bitcoin Development Company were everywhere.  First among those signals was the rocketing stock price — at its high of $543 in late November, MSTR was up nearly eight-fold in 2024 and more than a 50-bagger since the company began buying bitcoin (BTC) in August 2020.  There was also founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor — never shy about promoting his company's prospects and evangelizing for Bitcoin — who late this year had somehow become even more ubiquitous on the financial news, podcast and social media carousels.  It wasn't just the constant appearances, but subtle changes in Saylor's attitude to what might charitably be described by U.S. sports fans as ""spiking the football"" following a touchdown. Among them was the constant promotion of the MicroStrategy-invented key performance indicator of ""bitcoin yield,"" which recalled late 1990s made-up internet bubble metrics like ""page views."" His company flush with cash from share and convertible debt sales, Saylor — for reasons unknown — late in the year also got in the habit of teasing announcements of sizable new bitcoin purchases on the Sunday prior to the official regulatory filing on Monday morning.  And then there was the emergence of copycats. Despite years of the obvious success of Saylor's bitcoin treasury strategy, there had been a decided lack of other publicly traded corporates adopting the same. Yes, a few — even large-caps like the Elon Musk-led Tesla and Jack Dorsey-led Square — had dipped their toes into bitcoin acquisition. No other company of note, though, was willing to not only adopt bitcoin as their main treasury asset but take advantage of willing markets to raise additional capital with which to accumulate tokens.  That changed in a sizable way this year however, with small cap medical device maker Semler Scientific, Japan hotel operator Metaplanet, and a number of bitcoin miners among those embracing the Saylor vision — each of them earning social media plaudits from Saylor with every capital raise and bitcoin purchase announcement.  If something cannot go on forever, it will stop  Not content with being maybe the greatest trader ever and accumulating many billions of dollars, George Soros wanted to be known as a great thinker. It's no coincidence that his magnum opus on trading — the Theory of Reflexivity — sounds suspiciously similar to a famous theory from a fellow named Einstein.  Soros explained that investor perception and its effect on prices is a constant two-way street. In this way, perception (which is often wrong, as humans are fallible) can not just influence prices, but literally create its own reality, i.e. 1) investors believe a stock will go higher because earnings are about to get a big boost, 2) the stock price goes higher, 3) the high stock price allows management to raise capital at a cheaper cost than otherwise, 4) this improves earnings, 5) the stock price goes even higher, 6) the bulls pat themselves on the back for their brilliance and win over converts, … and so on.  Strip away much of Soros' philosophy and this is also known as a virtuous circle, in which MicroStrategy had surely found itself in 2024. Part of Soros' trading genius was recognizing these circles when they were happening and jumping on — in size. Another part of his genius was figuring out when the circles were about to break and getting out or even betting against them.  ""If something cannot go on forever, it will stop,"" said the late economist Herb Stein, who at the time was talking about government budget/trade deficits. Stein's Law, it turns out, was equally applicable to MicroStrategy shares.  Scoreboard: still showing remarkable gains  Changing hands at about $430 just after the Dec. 14 announcement of its coming inclusion into the Nasdaq-100 Index, MicroStrategy is now selling at just above $300, a decline of roughly 30% in just two weeks.  Looking back, there appear to have been cracks in the MicroStrategy bubble three weeks earlier. The stock peaked at about $543 on Nov. 21. Despite bitcoin's continued rise through late November and early December to an ultimate high above $108,000, MSTR lost ground — what technicians might call a troubling negative divergence. At the current $300, MicroStrategy for the moment is suffering a peak-to-trough drop of 45% in about five weeks.  MSTR shares have still put in a remarkable performance under anything except that very tiny time frame. They remain higher by more than 400% year-to-date and about 20-fold from the time Saylor initiated bitcoin purchases in August 2020.  While the bears might thus say the plunge has far to go, the bulls would surely point out that during MSTR's run since August 2020, the stock has suffered a number of similar scary short-to-medium term declines and has always resolved higher.  What would Soros say? Just possibly, he would remind that his Theory of Reflexivity taught that prices can go further (both upward and downward) than most could possibly expect.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/30/sell-the-news-micro-strategy-plunge-deepens-in-days-following-nasdaq-100-inclusion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d567adad3a6fb7c4f05731a9e21aa7acee1ebc88-2730x2730.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
38310548,https://finbold.com/?p=224236,1735572673,‘Santa Claus rally’ wipes $200 billion from crypto market,"The final days of a year are usually strong across the markets as lower volatility makes the impact of individual trades greater and as the holiday cheer lifts the spirits of investors. In 2024, however, the so-called ‘Santa Claus rally’ was truly spoiled by December 30, as both the stock and cryptocurrency markets experienced a substantial downturn. The crypto market, in particular, proved bloody as the cumulative valuation of digital assets collapsed approximately $200 billion from $3.36 trillion at the start of December 25 to $3.15 billion at press time, per TradingView data. Crypto market valuation 1-week chart. Source: TradingView Why ‘Santa Claus rally’ was replaced by a ‘Grinch downturn’ The lack of the ‘Santa Claus rally’ – or, perhaps, the presence of the ‘Grinch downturn’ – can largely be attributed to a relatively expected correction and consolidation phase following a massive upsurge as, for example, the cryptocurrency market capitalization skyrocketed $1.4 trillion from $2.29 trillion at the start of November to $3.69 trillion on December 17 – a 61.14% increase. Furthermore, it fell in line with a broader plunge that came as the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting reignited fears of weakening equity markets and the likely higher inflation rate in 2025. Indeed, while digital assets, spearheaded by Bitcoin ( BTC ), which fell from about $108,000 in mid-December to $91,687 at press time, took much of the attention, the S&P 500 stock index is down 2.83% since December 17. Additionally, major stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ) are down 5.17% and 13%, respectively. S&P 500 index 30-day price chart. Source: Google Will the crypto market continue rallying in 2025? Still, it is worth pointing out that the latest decline, despite seeing vast amounts of wealth erased from the markets, did little to diminish the overall rise of digital assets – and technology stocks and gold – in 2024. In fact, while the $200 billion 5-day wipe is staggering and was doubtlessly painful for many investors, the cryptocurrency market is still up $1.47 trillion in 2024, as it started the year with a market capitalization of $1.67 trillion. Cryptocurrency market valuation YTD chart. Source: TradingView Finally, the latest downturn is not necessarily indicative of more trouble ahead as there is, at least at press time on December 30, something of a consensus that the bull market will persist in 2025, with Bitcoin leading the way with stellar price targets that range from lows at $220,000 to highs above $800,000 .

38310547,https://finbold.com/?p=224234,1735572656,Will XRP price crash below $2 after erasing $6 billion in hours,"Despite experiencing an admirable run to the upside starting at the beginning of November, XRP’s momentum has shifted — and the digital asset is now seeing prices making significant moves to the downside. In the second to last week of December, XRP lost $20 billion in market cap — going from $152 billion to $132 billion. It has, unfortunately, continued this losing streak — at press time, the token’s market cap had receded to $116 billion, having shed $6 billion in a matter of hours on December 30. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.03 — down 25.09% from a December 2 high of $2.71. Although year-to-date (YTD) gains stand at 230.84%, the token has seen prices decrease by 5.88% on the daily chart on strong volume. XRP price 1-day chart. Source: Finbold XRP could easily drop beneath $2 — but would most likely recover quickly The $2 mark represents a crucial psychological barrier — a sustained drop beneath those levels would doubtlessly engender an even more bearish sentiment. With YTD returns being as impressive as they are, taking profits or reinvesting them in assets that are on the upswing is quite a rational move. XRP seems set to drop $2 in short order — and while that move will most likely cause a prolonged drop, this is still the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the world, and the drop will most likely be temporary. Let’s take a closer look at some of the most important factors affecting XRP. Ripple Labs’ escrow system unlocks 1 billion XRP tokens on the first day of every month. That’s due to happen on Wednesday — and the increased selling pressure and supply are almost certainly going to drive prices below $2. This will most likely be temporary — XRP will, in all likelihood, trade in tandem with the wider crypto market, which primarily takes its cues from Bitcoin ( BTC ). As the fundamental theses behind the bull run haven’t shifted significantly (even accounting for the announcement of fewer FED rate cuts in 2025), it appears as if it is only a matter of time before the uptrend resumes. In addition, with the chairmanship of Gary Gensler set to end, the likelihood of XRP spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) being approved is all but certain — a development that would go a long way in stabilizing price action.

Each quarter, the Grayscale Research team evaluates “hundreds of digital assets” to guide the rebalancing of the FTSE/Grayscale Crypto Sectors family of indexes. In the words of the research note, “Our approach incorporates a range of factors, including network growth/adoption, upcoming catalysts, sustainability of fundamentals, token valuation, token supply inflation, and potential tail risks.” The newest additions to the top 20 list are guided by three main market themes that Grayscale believes will shape the coming months: the US election and potential regulatory implications, rapid developments in decentralized AI, and the expanding Solana ecosystem. Related Reading: 2025 Crypto Forecast: Four-Year Cycle Points To Peak In Q2/Q4, Expert Advises Caution While Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Chainlink, Uniswap, SushiSwap, Aave, Bittensor, Optimism, Lido DAO, Helium, Arweave, Aerodrome and Akash Network remain on the the list, six new altcoins were added compared to the previous quarter. “We are adding the following six assets to our Top 20 list for Q1 2025,” the report states, emphasizing each project’s notable alignment with one or more of the aforementioned themes. Best (New) Crypto Assets For Q1 2025 Hyperliquid (HYPE): A Layer 1 blockchain geared toward on-chain financial applications, Hyperliquid’s flagship product is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for perpetual futures. Built around a fully on-chain order book, HYPE seeks to capture the growing demand for advanced derivatives trading in a decentralized environment. Notably, HYPE has seen a meteoric rise over the past weeks, already claiming rank #19 on the list of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Ethena (ENA): Ethena protocol has introduced a novel stablecoin, USDe, backed by hedged positions in Bitcoin and Ether. As Grayscale explains, “Specifically, the protocol holds long positions in Bitcoin and Ether and short positions in perpetual futures contracts on the same assets.” A staked version of the token leverages the pricing differential between spot and futures markets, potentially offering a unique yield profile for participants. Virtual Protocol (VIRTUAL): Operating on Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, Virtual Protocol enables the creation of AI agents designed to function autonomously. “These AI agents are designed to perform tasks autonomously, mimicking human decision-making,” Grayscale notes. The platform further allows for co-ownership of these agents via tokenization, bridging AI capabilities with blockchain infrastructure. Related Reading: Expert Reveals Top 15 Crypto Predictions For 2025 You Need To Know Jupiter (JUP): Jupiter has emerged as a leading DEX aggregator on Solana, recording the highest total value locked (TVL) among all Solana applications. With Solana’s user base broadening and speculation intensifying around memecoins and AI agent tokens, “we believe Jupiter is well positioned to capitalize on this growing market activity,” states the report. Jito (JTO): Jito is a liquid staking protocol on Solana that has demonstrated strong adoption over the past year. Notably, Grayscale highlights the project’s substantial earnings: “Jito has experienced substantial growth in adoption over the past year and offers one of the best financial profiles in all of crypto, generating over $550mn in 2024 fee revenue.” Grass (GRASS): Grass rewards users for sharing unused internet bandwidth via a Chrome extension. “This bandwidth is used to scrape online data, which is then sold to AI companies and developers for training machine learning models,” according to Grayscale. The project monetizes web scraping by redistributing rewards to users who contribute their idle bandwidth. Furthermore, Grayscale notes that it continues to be “excited about themes from previous quarters such as Ethereum scaling solutions, tokenization, and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN).” Examples of these established themes include Optimism, Chainlink, and Helium, which remain in the Top 20 due to their alignment with scaling, tokenization, and DePIN use cases, respectively. Notably, six assets—NEAR, Stacks, Maker CELO, UMA, and TON—have been rotated out of the Top 20 list this quarter. “Grayscale Research continues to see value in each of these projects, and they remain important elements of the crypto ecosystem. However, we believe the revised Top 20 list may offer more compelling risk-adjusted returns for the coming quarter,” Grayscale notes. At press time, HYPE traded at $29.45.

38310517,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=314572,1735572624,"US Government’s Motivations for BTC Standard Likely Differ From Bitcoiners, Warns CryptoQuant CEO","The chief executive of market intelligence platform CryptoQuant is warning investors that the US government’s motivations for creating a Bitcoin ( BTC ) standard may be different from what they expect. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Ki Young Ju says that for the US to seriously consider a BTC standard, it would have to see its global economic dominance threatened by another nation. “I personally support the idea of Bitcoin Standard. However, I question whether the U.S., while continuing to grow as other economies stagnate, would adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset. For the debate to gain serious momentum, the U.S. would need to see its global economic dominance genuinely threatened. At present, market sentiment suggests confidence in the U.S.’s continued supremacy.” The Bitcoin Standard – which is also a book written by Saifedean Ammous – refers to the idea that the US government could use Bitcoin as a reserve asset. According to Ju, while it’s in the realm of possibility that the government creates a BTC standard, even if it did, the government’s intentions would vastly differ from that of Bitcoin bulls and investors, though no specifics were mentioned. “While it’s conceivable that the U.S. government could purchase Bitcoin for risk management or economic leverage, its motivations would likely differ greatly from what Bitcoiners imagine. The notion of buying Bitcoin to prepare for a Bitcoin Standard or as a tool to defend the dollar system seems far removed from the current reality. With global capital flowing into the U.S., many still believe the dollar’s dominance is secure.” Ju concludes by noting that if President-elect Donald Trump’s term is successful and he rebuilds the strength of the US dollar, he could change his pro-BTC stance. “If Trump succeeds in showcasing U.S. economic resilience, reinforcing the dollar’s supremacy, and boosting his approval ratings, it’s unclear if he would maintain the strong pro-Bitcoin stance he demonstrated during his campaign. He could easily step back from his Bitcoin advocacy, citing changing priorities, without alienating his voter base.” Earlier this month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the government is not legally allowed to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset and has no plans to change the law, causing the crypto king to see a significant dip in price.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Magic Eden (ME) have been popular investment options recently, a new DeFi coin is rapidly gaining momentum, offering a potential 50x return. This DeFi coin is among the best altcoins to buy now since its native platform comes with exclusive features like staking rewards and a broker-backed crypto prop firm. Here we will explore why crypto bulls are shifting focus from SHIB and ME to capitalize on this new DeFi coin before it explodes. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Shiba Inu Struggles in December, But Crypto Bulls Keep Faith Shiba Inu has faced challenges in December 2024, losing over 16.59% in token price this month and more than 32% since December 9, 2024. Despite the dip, SHIB rebounded from $0.00002095 to $0.00002233 as whales and crypto bulls continued accumulating. For example, on December 23, whales purchased 1.21 trillion SHIB worth $26.6 million while selling 413 billion SHIB, causing a net inflow of 799.32 billion tokens, which is an 11-day high. Exchange reserves have also dropped continuously from 140.87 trillion SHIB on December 7 to 135.74 trillion, highlighting reduced selling pressure and increasing confidence in SHIB’s long-term potential. SHIB was valued at $0.00002222 on December 26, down 7.98% in the past week. Meanwhile, a new crypto trading project outpaces Shiba Inu with its innovative features like the Trade2Earn program, rewarding every trade with its DeFi coin, and its staking rewards program offering crypto bulls up to a 20% APY. The ME Token Faces Setbacks as a New DeFi Coin Offers Higher Profits Magic Eden introduced its ME token on December 10, 2024, with an airdrop surpassing $700 million. Although there were complications during the claim process, more than 70,000 traders claimed almost 69 million ME tokens in the first hour. Magic Eden attributed the challenges to high app traffic but insisted on the airdrop’s massive participation and trading activity.

Dogecoin News- Latest Developments and Market Sentiment Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently experienced significant price volatility. After reaching a 2024 peak of $0.48, it has declined by approximately 35%, currently trading around $0.31. This downturn is partly attributed to hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which have shifted market sentiment. Despite this, Dogecoin maintains its position as the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Analysts observe increased activity among large holders, or ""whales,"" with over 9,400 transactions exceeding $100,000, indicating potential support levels. However, minimal inflows and a neutral Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator suggest cautious investor sentiment. The Dogecoin Fear and Greed Index reflects a sideways market with moderate volatility, highlighting the need for sustained buying pressure to regain momentum. Market participants should monitor these dynamics closely, as whale activity and broader market trends will likely influence DOGE's future performance.

38310275,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116125,1735572041,U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Understanding the $379M Outflows and Future Implications,"U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have become one of the most closely watched financial instruments in the cryptocurrency space, offering investors exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated vehicle. In the face of rapidly changing market conditions, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs faced a staggering net outflow of $379 million last week alone, raising questions about the short-term and long-term implications for investors and the broader crypto market. Below, we delve into the details behind these outflows, explore historical context, dissect current market sentiment, and consider future prospects for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Overview of the $379M Outflows On December 30, 2024, at 11:34 AM, a notable development emerged in the cryptocurrency ecosystem: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a combined net outflow of $379 million in just one week. This data, reported by Trader T (@thepfund) on X (formerly Twitter), underscores a dynamic period for ETF issuers and investors alike. According to these figures: Fidelity’s FBTC witnessed the largest outflow, totaling $183 million. BlackRock’s IBIT followed suit with outflows of $22.7 million. Grayscale’s BTC and VanEck’s HODL were the only ETFs to show net inflows, albeit modest ($0.99 million and $0.1 million, respectively). Despite the sizable outflows over this specific period, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have collectively garnered a total net inflow of $16.8 billion throughout Q4, making it the strongest quarter of 2024. This duality—short-term outflows amid broader quarterly strength—suggests a complicated landscape where both bullish and bearish forces are at play. The Rise of Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A Brief History To understand the significance of these outflows, it’s crucial to appreciate the journey spot Bitcoin ETFs have undergone in the U.S. market. For years, the crypto industry clamored for a spot-based Bitcoin ETF, seeing it as a milestone that would legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of traditional investors. Prior to the debut of these funds, only futures-based Bitcoin ETFs existed, which often carry high costs and unique risks due to the complexities of rolling futures contracts. Early Hesitation by Regulators : The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) exercised caution in approving a spot Bitcoin ETF, citing concerns about potential market manipulation and the nascent regulatory framework surrounding digital assets. Gradual Acceptance : Over time, major financial players demonstrated considerable interest. Asset management giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck stepped up to apply for spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, indicating widespread institutional desire for a more straightforward Bitcoin investment tool. Market Enthusiasm : The eventual approval of these spot Bitcoin ETFs became a watershed moment for the crypto ecosystem. It paved the way for large-scale inflows as institutional and retail investors alike sought exposure to Bitcoin via traditional brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of managing private keys or crypto wallets. Given this history, the news of net outflows in these funds is particularly eye-catching. While short-term fluctuations are typical in any market, the question remains: Are these outflows indicative of a reversal in investor sentiment, or are they part of normal market volatility? Possible Triggers Behind the Recent Outflows 1. Profit-Taking After a Strong Quarter One possible explanation for the $379M net outflows is profit-taking. Q4 of 2024 marked the best quarter for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, with over $16.8 billion in net inflows. Such rapid inflow often pushes Bitcoin’s price upward, creating a profit-making scenario for short-term traders. As the quarter nears its end, investors might be locking in gains, leading to short bursts of withdrawals or repositioning. 2. Year-End Portfolio Rebalancing Institutional investors typically rebalance their portfolios toward the end of the year to meet specific allocation targets or tax-related strategies. These maneuvers can lead to temporary outflows even from top-performing funds. Thus, it’s plausible that the net outflows are a function of year-end tax planning and institutional portfolio readjustments rather than a fundamental decline in bullish sentiment toward Bitcoin. 3. Regulatory Uncertainty Although regulators have become more open to crypto, concerns still linger. News of SEC crackdowns on certain crypto exchanges or unclear guidelines for stablecoins might make some ETF investors uncomfortable. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can prompt cautious investors to pull out until the regulatory landscape becomes more transparent. 4. Market Dynamics and Macroeconomic Factors Bitcoin, and by extension spot Bitcoin ETFs, do not operate in a vacuum. Macroeconomic elements such as inflation, interest rate hikes, or a broad financial market slump can heavily influence crypto investment decisions. If interest rates rise, some investors move capital into fixed-income securities for stable returns, reducing their appetite for riskier assets like Bitcoin ETFs. Diverging Performance Among ETFs Interestingly, only two U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs—Grayscale’s BTC and VanEck’s HODL—recorded inflows last week. These inflows were relatively modest ($0.99 million and $0.1 million, respectively) but stand out in a week dominated by outflows. Grayscale’s BTC : Grayscale has historically been a leading name in crypto investment products. While its flagship is often known for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the ability to convert or leverage new ETF products could attract investors looking for brand familiarity. VanEck’s HODL : VanEck has been a significant proponent of crypto ETFs, offering various innovative funds that cater to different investor profiles. That these funds saw inflows may reflect their distinct positioning, fee structures, or investor loyalty. This divergence in performance underscores the competitive nature of the ETF market. Management fees, marketing, and track record can all influence where investors place their capital. For new entrants or ETFs with smaller asset under management (AUM), building trust can be a hurdle. Consequently, a single week’s worth of data should be interpreted cautiously; funds can quickly move back into positive territory if market sentiment swings bullish. Assessing the Broader Context: Q4’s Bullish Momentum It’s crucial to note that despite the eye-catching outflow of $379 million last week, the overall narrative for Q4 2024 remains extremely positive. Spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively amassed $16.8 billion in net inflows, marking a record-setting quarter. This level of inflow suggests that institutional and retail enthusiasm for Bitcoin exposure remains robust. Increased Institutional Adoption : The ongoing entry of major financial institutions has lent additional legitimacy to Bitcoin. Hedge funds, pension funds, and family offices that once viewed crypto as a fringe market are now more open to diversifying portfolios with a slice of Bitcoin. Technological Maturity : Bitcoin’s core protocol and the infrastructure supporting it have matured significantly in recent years. Custodial solutions, second-layer networks, and regulatory frameworks have all advanced, reducing perceived risks. Global Uncertainty : Turmoil in traditional financial markets often makes decentralized assets like Bitcoin more appealing. In countries facing high inflation or stringent capital controls, Bitcoin’s value proposition as a store of value and hedge against local currency devaluation resonates with investors. Given these elements, the spike in net inflows throughout Q4 is hardly surprising. Nonetheless, short-term outflows can still occur as individual players adjust their strategies, reacting to both macro and micro market signals. Future Outlook for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs 1. Potential for More ETF Approvals The demand for Bitcoin-related investment products continues to rise, spurring additional applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs from both new and established asset managers. Competition in this arena could potentially lead to more diverse offerings, improved fee structures, and better investor protection mechanisms. More participants could also lead to higher trading volumes and enhanced liquidity. 2. Evolving Regulatory Environment Regulatory clarity is expected to improve over time. The SEC and other U.S. regulators are progressively refining their guidelines for digital assets, stablecoins, and crypto exchanges. As rules become more transparent, investor confidence in spot Bitcoin ETFs may stabilize or grow, diminishing the likelihood of large, sudden outflows triggered by regulatory FUD. 3. Integration With Traditional Finance Mainstream financial institutions continue to explore ways to integrate crypto services into their offerings. This integration might involve banks acting as custodians for Bitcoin or providing seamless trading platforms for ETFs. A synergy between crypto and traditional finance can create a more robust ecosystem, making it easier and safer for a broader segment of investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. 4. Market Cycles and Volatility Despite a favorable outlook, volatility remains inherent to the crypto market. Bitcoin has historically experienced significant price swings, and these swings can translate into more dramatic inflow or outflow events for ETFs. Investors should be prepared for the possibility of both short-lived dips and extended bull or bear cycles. Strategic Considerations for ETF Investors 1. Diversification Even with the growing acceptance of Bitcoin, investors are generally advised to keep crypto-related holdings within a reasonable proportion of their overall portfolio. Diversification across asset classes—stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, and digital assets—can mitigate risk. 2. Long-Term Perspective Bitcoin’s technology and value proposition remain in flux. Regulatory developments, technical upgrades (like the Lightning Network), and institutional adoption can significantly alter the crypto landscape. A long-term approach allows investors to ride out interim volatility and potentially benefit from the asset’s growth trajectory. 3. Research and Due Diligence Not all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are created equal. Investors should compare ETFs on parameters like expense ratios, tracking accuracy, custodial arrangements, and brand reputation. Similarly, they should remain informed about ongoing developments in Bitcoin’s regulatory environment and technical roadmap. 4. Tax Implications Cryptocurrencies and related financial products can carry unique tax consequences, especially if regulators implement new guidelines. Staying updated on tax rules and consulting a financial advisor can help investors optimize their strategies and avoid unexpected liabilities. Comparing Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Futures-Based ETFs Before spot Bitcoin ETFs received approval, the market primarily offered futures-based Bitcoin ETFs. While these served as an initial bridge between traditional finance and crypto, key differences set them apart from their spot-based counterparts: Underlying Asset : Spot ETFs directly hold Bitcoin, providing real-time exposure to the asset. Futures ETFs invest in Bitcoin futures contracts, incurring costs from rolling contracts and potential price divergences. Expense Ratios : Futures-based ETFs often carry higher expense ratios due to the complexities and risks associated with the futures market. Spot ETFs can theoretically operate with lower fees since they simply hold the underlying asset. Tracking Error : Futures-based funds can struggle with tracking the price of Bitcoin accurately, particularly during periods of high volatility. Spot ETFs, on the other hand, often exhibit more direct price correlation. Investor Base : Some institutional investors prefer spot exposure for clarity and simplicity, whereas others may use futures ETFs for short-term or hedging strategies. The long-awaited approval of spot ETFs has likely broadened the market by attracting investors who were hesitant to interact with futures products. The transition from futures-based ETFs to spot Bitcoin ETFs indicates a maturing market. However, both products continue to coexist, serving different investor needs and risk profiles. The Importance of Q4’s Performance Q4 2024 will likely be remembered as a pivotal quarter for spot Bitcoin ETFs. The record-breaking inflows of $16.8 billion highlight a profound interest in Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio. Even though the most recent week saw $379 million in outflows, many industry analysts view this as a transient phenomenon rather than the start of a larger exodus from crypto-ETF products. 1. Sentiment Shifts Are Part of the Market Cycle Bitcoin’s volatility extends beyond its spot price to related instruments like ETFs. Occasional outflows can simply reflect changing sentiment among swing traders, year-end financial planning, or broader market jitters. The crucial element is the big picture: Q4’s net inflow remains unprecedented. 2. Institutional versus Retail Dynamics Institutional players often drive more significant shifts in market dynamics due to their sizable positions. However, the increasing accessibility of spot Bitcoin ETFs to retail investors also plays a role in stabilizing the market. Retail inflows can mitigate institutional outflows to some degree and vice versa. 3. Global Perspective While the U.S. regulatory stance influences global market sentiment, Bitcoin’s appeal extends worldwide. Other countries have approved or are considering spot crypto ETFs, and the cross-border nature of Bitcoin ensures that capital flows from international investors can also impact liquidity and pricing. Challenges Ahead for Spot Bitcoin ETFs Regulatory Ambiguity : Although acceptance is growing, the regulatory framework for digital assets continues to evolve, which can periodically generate uncertainty and volatility. Competition Among Funds : As more spot Bitcoin ETFs enter the market, competition will intensify. Lower fees, robust marketing, and brand reputation will be key to attracting and retaining investors. Technological Risks : Cybersecurity remains a concern. If any high-profile hack or breach of custodial solutions for an ETF occurs, it could undermine confidence in the entire sector. Market Saturation : Over the long term, if too many spot Bitcoin ETFs flood the market, the products could become commoditized, potentially pressuring fees and limiting profitability for providers. Conclusion U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are at a fascinating crossroads: On one hand, the $379 million outflow last week raises eyebrows, fueling speculation about shifting investor sentiment. On the other hand, the broader picture paints a decidedly bullish narrative, with Q4 net inflows reaching an astounding $16.8 billion—an all-time high for these products. This juxtaposition underscores the complexity of crypto markets, where short-term fluctuations can occur within an overarching trend of growing institutional and retail interest. The performance of individual funds like Fidelity’s FBTC, BlackRock’s IBIT, Grayscale’s BTC, and VanEck’s HODL demonstrates that competition and distinct fund structures can yield varying outcomes even within the same asset class. As regulations continue to crystallize, technological solutions improve, and mainstream finance embraces crypto, spot Bitcoin ETFs are likely to remain a significant investment vehicle for those seeking easy and regulated exposure to Bitcoin. For investors, the key lies in thorough research, a balanced perspective, and a long-term mindset. Profit-taking, year-end portfolio adjustments, and macroeconomic considerations can all drive short-term volatility, but they don’t necessarily diminish the fundamental appeal of Bitcoin. If anything, the strong net inflows in Q4 point to a continued uptrend in institutional acceptance, growing market maturity, and the potential for robust growth in the sector as new players enter and competition pushes innovation forward.

38310273,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116127,1735571988,South Korea Corporate Crypto Investments: 2025 Delay Sparks Debate,"South Korea Corporate Crypto Investments have taken center stage once again as the country’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced a postponement of its decision to allow corporate cryptocurrency investments until 2025. This news, reported on December 30, 2024, at 11:33 AM, has sparked a wave of debate and speculation across the crypto space—both domestically and worldwide. The directive, initially put in place in December 2017, banned corporate entities from investing in virtual assets. Since it involves government-wide coordination for modification or removal, any shift in this policy would mark a considerable change in how companies engage with digital assets. Below, we dissect the background of South Korea’s 2017 ban, explore the reasons for the new delay to 2025, and evaluate the broader implications of such a move. We also consider what the postponement means for crypto markets, regulatory clarity, corporate innovation, and the global crypto landscape, offering a comprehensive view of the evolving regulatory environment in one of the world’s most tech-savvy nations. 1. Background of the 2017 Ban 1.1 Genesis of the Emergency Directive In December 2017, South Korea’s Office for Government Policy Coordination issued an emergency administrative directive that effectively prohibited corporations from investing in virtual assets, such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This ban emerged at a time when crypto hype was at a fever pitch worldwide, and concerns about potential money laundering, speculative bubbles, and consumer protection were paramount. 1.2 Rationale Behind the Strict Approach Policymakers felt that allowing corporate treasuries to invest in digital assets could lead to overly speculative behaviors, disrupt financial stability, and expose companies to unwarranted risks. At the time, the nascent crypto industry was perceived largely as unregulated and prone to market manipulation. Therefore, banning corporate investments was a precautionary measure intended to shield both businesses and the national economy from volatile and under-regulated markets. 1.3 Impact on Domestic Crypto Ecosystem South Korea has a vibrant crypto community, and many blockchain startups call the country home. The 2017 directive caused companies and entrepreneurs to tread carefully. While the ban pertained specifically to corporate treasuries, it signaled a broader governmental caution toward institutional involvement in digital assets. Nevertheless, retail investors remained highly active, leading to the rise of local exchanges and fostering an environment where individual traders embraced digital currencies—often referred to as “kimchi premium” periods when local prices soared higher than global averages. 2. Why the Delay to 2025? 2.1 The Role of the Virtual Asset Committee The Virtual Asset Committee, a body established to address issues surrounding digital assets, is scheduled to meet in January 2025. This committee’s purview includes reviewing the current ban, analyzing market conditions, and recommending any changes to existing regulations. The fact that the committee opted to delay its decision underscores ongoing concerns about market maturity, investor protection, and the broader economic implications. 2.2 Regulatory Caution Amid Global Uncertainty Cryptocurrencies remain a global phenomenon, and their value often fluctuates wildly. With macroeconomic factors—such as inflation, recession fears, and changing monetary policies—coming into play, regulators globally have been reevaluating the risks and opportunities of crypto. South Korean authorities likely want to see more stability in international markets and clearer norms around crypto custody, trading, and taxation before giving the green light to corporate investments. 2.3 Lessons Learned from Past Turbulences Crypto markets have seen their fair share of crises since 2017, including high-profile exchange hacks, allegations of market manipulation, and major bankruptcies in the industry. These events reinforce regulators’ caution. By pushing the timeline to 2025, South Korea’s FSC allows itself ample space to implement additional safeguards, understand new technologies, and gauge how best to protect both institutional and retail participants. 3. Market Reaction: Mixed Signals 3.1 Corporate Enthusiasm Tempered Many large South Korean conglomerates—colloquially referred to as “chaebols”—had been exploring the potential for blockchain-based services, tokenized assets, and strategic crypto investments. With the decision now pushed to 2025, these corporations may either slow down or redirect their ambitions, focusing instead on non-investment blockchain applications (e.g., supply chain tracking, digital identity solutions, or internal token systems). 3.2 Startup Ecosystem Remains Resilient While corporate treasuries are barred from direct crypto investments, South Korean blockchain startups are still forging ahead. Government grants, private venture capital, and partnerships with established tech companies continue to fuel innovation. For instance, new DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols, NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplaces, and layer-2 scaling solutions frequently emerge in the country. The delayed decision may not hamper this startup ecosystem but rather highlight the regulatory complexities that must be navigated as projects scale. 3.3 Global Investors Monitor Developments International investors observe South Korea’s moves closely, given its history of driving significant cryptocurrency trading volumes. A regulatory pivot to allow corporate crypto investments could catalyze capital inflows and set a precedent for other nations in Asia. Conversely, further delays may see some global investors shift their focus to jurisdictions with clearer regulatory frameworks, such as Singapore or certain European Union member states. 4. Implications for Corporate Innovation 4.1 Treasury Diversification Strategies In many parts of the world, corporations increasingly view Bitcoin and other digital assets as alternative stores of value or hedges against inflation. With regulations restricting such investments in South Korea, local companies might miss out on diversification opportunities during bullish cycles. On the other hand, they avoid the heightened volatility risk that cryptocurrencies can present, especially in bear markets. 4.2 Competitive Positioning in Global Markets South Korea is renowned for its technological prowess, particularly in electronics, AI, and telecommunications. Delaying corporate crypto investments until 2025 may mean local firms lag behind global competitors that are already leveraging blockchain-based finance solutions. Innovations in tokenization, smart contracts, and cross-border payments could move faster in markets where corporate participation in crypto is permitted. 4.3 Potential Impact on Talent Acquisition Tech-savvy professionals worldwide are increasingly drawn to workplaces offering forward-thinking approaches to emerging technologies, including blockchain. Restrictions on corporate crypto investments could be perceived as stifling innovation, possibly discouraging some high-level talent from seeking positions in South Korea’s corporate sector. That said, the country’s robust startup scene may absorb much of this talent, mitigating any potential brain drain from large enterprises. 5. The Global Regulatory Landscape 5.1 Comparisons with Other Major Economies South Korea’s stance contrasts with certain jurisdictions that have been more welcoming to corporate crypto investments. In the United States, while regulatory uncertainties abound, some major companies—like Tesla and MicroStrategy—have allocated parts of their treasury to Bitcoin. Singapore has emerged as a crypto hub, with relatively clear rules on what’s permissible for both institutions and retail investors. 5.2 Influence of International Bodies Global organizations, such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), continuously issue guidance on regulating digital assets. Their reports and recommendations often shape national policies. South Korean regulators could be awaiting further international consensus before revising internal directives. 5.3 Balancing Innovation and Consumer Protection Many nations grapple with striking the right balance between fostering innovation and protecting the public from fraud, market crashes, and security breaches. South Korea’s decision to delay might reflect a broader policy of incremental integration of crypto into the corporate sphere, ensuring that robust consumer protections and anti-money laundering protocols are solidified first. 6. Potential Benefits of Allowing Corporate Crypto Investments 6.1 Attracting Foreign Direct Investment If South Korea were to lift the ban on corporate crypto investments, international firms dealing in digital assets might be more inclined to set up local offices or forge partnerships with domestic companies. An influx of foreign capital and expertise could further cement the country’s status as a regional tech hub. 6.2 Boosting Institutional Trading Volumes Allowing corporate treasury allocations to crypto could significantly increase trading volumes on South Korean exchanges. This uptick could foster a more liquid market, encouraging better price discovery and potentially reducing the notorious “kimchi premium” that emerges from supply-demand imbalances. 6.3 Driving Innovation in Blockchain Solutions Corporate investment in crypto often accompanies a deeper engagement with blockchain projects, whether for supply chain management, loyalty programs, decentralized finance, or enterprise resource planning. This involvement can fast-track blockchain’s integration into various industries, from finance and logistics to entertainment and healthcare. 7. Potential Risks and Concerns 7.1 Market Volatility Critics argue that digital assets remain too volatile for widespread corporate adoption. A sharp dip in cryptocurrency valuations could harm a company’s balance sheet, potentially impacting its creditworthiness and overall market stability. 7.2 Regulatory and Compliance Hurdles Complying with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations can be complex, especially for corporations engaging directly with crypto. The cost of building robust compliance frameworks may deter smaller or mid-sized companies with limited resources. 7.3 Systemic Risk If many large corporations begin to allocate significant capital to crypto, systemic risks in times of market distress could ripple across industries. Regulators fear a scenario where a major crypto crash undermines the financial health of multiple large enterprises simultaneously, affecting shareholders, employees, and consumers. 8. The Role of the Government and Policy Coordination 8.1 Office for Government Policy Coordination Since the ban came through an emergency administrative directive by the Office for Government Policy Coordination, any changes require not just a nod from the FSC but from broader governmental stakeholders. This means legislative bodies, economic agencies, and national security interests must align before the ban is lifted. 8.2 Inter-Ministerial Collaboration Shaping the future of corporate crypto investments in South Korea involves multiple government ministries, including finance, justice, and possibly even defense, given concerns about cybersecurity and foreign infiltration. Achieving consensus can be lengthy, especially if different ministries have contrasting views on the crypto economy’s benefits versus risks. 8.3 Political Will and Public Opinion Elected officials are sensitive to public opinion, which can swing heavily based on media reports of crypto scams or success stories. If the public perceives crypto as a bubble or a risky asset class, politicians may hesitate to advance pro-crypto measures. Conversely, a wave of success stories and robust consumer protections could shift public sentiment positively. 9. Corporate Strategies in the Interim 9.1 Focus on Blockchain, Not Tokens Without the ability to invest directly in cryptocurrencies, South Korean companies may channel resources into blockchain research and development. Private, permissioned blockchains—where tokens might be used internally for record-keeping or loyalty points—could gain traction without running afoul of the investment ban. 9.2 Partnerships with Approved Entities In some cases, corporations may partner with foreign companies or licensed crypto trading platforms that operate within regulatory gray areas. By doing so, they can gain indirect exposure to digital assets and glean experience without directly violating the domestic ban. 9.3 Preparing for 2025 Forward-looking corporations might already be preparing internal policies, compliance guidelines, and education programs so that, if the ban is lifted in 2025, they can move swiftly. By being proactive, they can gain a competitive edge in a market that may witness a sudden influx of corporate capital post-regulatory approval. 10. Lessons from Neighboring Countries 10.1 Japan’s Proactive Approach Japan is often hailed as one of the earliest adopters of crypto regulations, having recognized Bitcoin as a legal form of payment in 2017. While Japan has also faced challenges, its clear regulatory framework has allowed many companies to explore crypto-friendly initiatives. 10.2 China’s Restrictive Stance On the other end of the spectrum, China has clamped down heavily on crypto trading and mining. Nevertheless, China champions the development of blockchain technology, especially its central bank digital currency (CBDC). South Korea’s policymakers must find a middle ground, acknowledging both innovation and risk management. 10.3 Singapore’s Balanced Ecosystem Singapore fosters a crypto-friendly environment, attracting numerous exchanges and blockchain startups, while maintaining strict AML and KYC rules. Its balance of innovation and regulation provides a model that South Korea may study as it refines its approach to corporate crypto investments. 11. Future Outlook: Bridging the Gap to 2025 11.1 Technological Advancements on the Horizon By 2025, blockchain and crypto technology will likely have evolved further. Upgraded protocols, layer-2 solutions, more mature DeFi ecosystems, and advanced risk management tools could mitigate some of the concerns driving South Korea’s cautious stance today. 11.2 Institutional Infrastructure Global financial institutions continue to enter the crypto space, introducing more sophisticated custody solutions, insurance products, and auditing practices. By 2025, these offerings may be robust enough for South Korean regulators to feel comfortable lifting the ban. 11.3 Possible Gradual Rollout Even if the ban is lifted, the government may adopt a phased approach—initially allowing only large, financially stable corporations to invest, or imposing strict investment caps. Over time, if results are positive, these restrictions could be relaxed. 12. Conclusion South Korea’s decision to delay allowing South Korea Corporate Crypto Investments until 2025 reflects a careful balancing act between fostering technological innovation and protecting the economy and investors from perceived risks. Rooted in a 2017 emergency directive, this ban has underscored the government’s measured approach to digital asset integration. While some companies may feel stifled by the continued ban, many remain hopeful that the upcoming discussions by the Virtual Asset Committee will pave the way for a more open, yet tightly regulated, corporate crypto environment. Globally, the crypto industry evolves at breakneck speed, and two years can be an eternity in this space. By 2025, improvements in market stability, institutional-grade infrastructure, and clearer international standards may alleviate many of the fears that led to South Korea’s cautious stance. Until then, corporate treasuries will have to wait on the sidelines, and innovative blockchain startups will continue to push the envelope in areas not restricted by the ban. For investors and market observers, the journey to 2025 promises to be crucial in shaping South Korea’s place in the global crypto ecosystem. Will it emerge as a leader that harmonizes advanced technology with prudent regulation, or will it fall behind more agile markets? Only time will tell, but the world will undoubtedly be watching.

38310212,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116130,1735571937,U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs: A Comprehensive Look at the $349M Weekly Net Inflows and Future Outlook,"U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs saw a notable surge last week, recording a staggering net inflow of $349 million, according to SoSoValue data on December 30, 2024, at 11:36 AM. This influx illustrates a growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition among institutional and retail investors alike. Leading the charge are BlackRock’s ETHA with $182 million and Fidelity’s FETH with $160 million, pushing cumulative net inflows across all spot Ethereum ETFs to an impressive $2.68 billion. Below, we delve into the factors driving these inflows, analyze market reactions, discuss major players in the space, and explore what the future may hold for Ethereum-focused exchange-traded funds. 1. The Rise of Spot Ethereum ETFs 1.1 The Move from Futures to Spot For years, the cryptocurrency market eagerly awaited the approval of spot-based Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, which eventually paved the way for spot Ethereum ETFs. Before the introduction of these spot products, U.S. investors’ primary option for Ethereum exposure was through futures-based ETFs, which often involve added complexities like rolling contracts and potentially higher fees. The approval of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs signaled a maturation of the crypto market, allowing institutional and retail investors alike to gain direct exposure to Ether (ETH), the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain, without navigating private wallets or crypto exchanges. 1.2 Ethereum’s Unique Value Proposition Ethereum differs from Bitcoin in that it operates as a versatile platform supporting smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and a multitude of token standards (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-721 for NFTs). This functionality draws developers and entrepreneurs to build projects ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to metaverse solutions. The perceived utility and continuous evolution of Ethereum’s network have helped it earn a spot as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. 1.3 Regulatory Milestones Regulators in the United States, specifically the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), showed initial reluctance to approve spot-based crypto ETFs due to concerns about market manipulation and insufficient investor protection. However, as the crypto ecosystem matured—with robust custodial services, improved market surveillance, and institutional involvement—regulators began green-lighting such products. The entrance of established players like BlackRock and Fidelity further reassured regulators and helped push spot Ethereum ETFs into the market. 2. Key Drivers Behind the $349M Weekly Net Inflows 2.1 Growing Institutional Interest Large-scale institutions continue to find value in Ethereum’s ecosystem, especially in the domains of DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise blockchain applications. Institutions eye Ether not only as a potential hedge against inflation or an investment in digital store-of-value but also as an opportunity to gain exposure to the expanding decentralized economy. This heightened interest from major funds, asset managers, and even corporate treasuries has translated into accelerated inflows. 2.2 Market Sentiment and Broader Adoption General sentiment around Ethereum remains bullish, thanks to ongoing upgrades and improvements to its scalability and efficiency. The Merge—a shift from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) completed in 2022—marked a crucial step in Ethereum’s roadmap. Subsequent upgrades like Shanghai (enabling ETH staking withdrawals) continued to bolster investor confidence. As mainstream adoption of Ethereum’s blockchain grows, more market participants see Ether as a core digital asset worth holding, fueling ETF inflows. 2.3 Diversification and Portfolio Balance With Bitcoin often viewed as “digital gold,” Ethereum is sometimes described as the “digital oil” powering a wide range of decentralized applications. Investors seeking diversification within the crypto space find Ethereum’s utility appealing. Spot Ethereum ETFs offer an accessible avenue to include ETH in portfolios without delving into the complexities of wallets, private keys, and exchange trading. As a result, both retail and institutional investors have found these ETFs an attractive diversification tool. 3. Market Reaction and Broader Implications 3.1 Positive Market Momentum The $349 million net inflows last week spurred optimism among ETH holders and crypto enthusiasts, reflecting the market’s faith in Ethereum’s ongoing development and potential. Price movements for ETH often track these inflow patterns, as increased demand from ETF issuers can tighten supply on exchanges, potentially boosting Ether’s market price. 3.2 Competition Among Top ETF Issuers BlackRock’s ETHA, Fidelity’s FETH, and other emerging Ethereum-focused ETFs compete for market share based on factors such as expense ratios, brand reputation, and portfolio performance. BlackRock’s commanding $182 million in net inflows demonstrates the asset management giant’s significant pull, though Fidelity’s close second at $160 million underscores that brand loyalty and product differentiation matter to investors. This competitive environment could eventually drive down fees and improve product offerings for consumers. 3.3 Amplified Institutional Adoption The presence of large asset managers in the Ethereum space helps dismantle lingering skepticism about digital assets. When top-tier financial players endorse Ether via ETFs, it instills further confidence in more traditional institutional circles, paving the way for expanded crypto integration in pension funds, endowments, and corporate treasuries. 4. Major Players in U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs 4.1 BlackRock’s ETHA BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has been at the forefront of bridging traditional finance and cryptocurrency. ETHA’s $182 million net inflow last week highlights the immense trust investors place in BlackRock’s name and its robust track record in fund management. The company’s foray into Ethereum ETFs also suggests it sees long-term value in Ether’s network effects and use cases. 4.2 Fidelity’s FETH Fidelity stands as another heavyweight in the investment management sphere, managing trillions of dollars in assets. FETH’s $160 million net inflow underscores Fidelity’s ongoing commitment to crypto and its appeal among both retail and institutional clients. Fidelity’s integrated brokerage platforms and established client base may provide a seamless route for new investors venturing into digital assets. 4.3 Other Emerging ETFs While BlackRock and Fidelity dominate the headlines, other ETF issuers also see a growing share of inflows. Companies with a focus on crypto, such as Grayscale and VanEck, are known for pioneering digital asset products. They may be joining the spot Ethereum ETF space in the near future—or expanding their offerings—leading to broader market competition and improved options for investors. 5. Historical Context: Tracking Ethereum’s Evolution 5.1 From ICOs to DeFi Ethereum’s launch in 2015 spurred a wave of innovation, starting with the initial coin offering (ICO) boom in 2017. While that era had its share of controversies and scams, it also laid the groundwork for a more structured and impactful decentralized finance sector. Around 2019 to 2020, DeFi gained significant traction, enabling lending, borrowing, and yield farming through smart contracts on Ethereum. DeFi’s meteoric rise showcased Ethereum’s real-world utility and caught the attention of global investors. 5.2 Transition to Proof of Stake In September 2022, Ethereum made headlines by transitioning from a PoW to a PoS consensus model, drastically reducing its energy consumption and theoretically boosting its scalability. This shift, known as The Merge, helped dispel concerns about crypto’s environmental impact and positioned Ethereum as a more sustainable platform compared to other PoW coins. The positive sentiment around The Merge is widely believed to have contributed to growing institutional interest in ETH. 5.3 Post-Merge Upgrades and Future Plans Ethereum’s roadmap includes further improvements aimed at addressing congestion and high transaction fees. Solutions like sharding and layer-2 rollups (e.g., Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups) will play crucial roles in scaling the network. Each successful milestone reaffirms Ethereum’s vision of being a decentralized “world computer,” which in turn attracts more capital through channels like ETFs. 6. The Competitive Landscape: Spot Ethereum vs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs 6.1 Divergent Use Cases While Bitcoin is often compared to gold due to its store-of-value narrative, Ethereum’s broader functionality distinguishes it in the eyes of investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs cater to those seeking a digital asset with a finite supply and robust security, whereas spot Ethereum ETFs offer exposure to a platform fueling an entire ecosystem of dApps, DeFi, NFTs, and more. 6.2 Overlapping and Distinct Investor Bases Many crypto-focused portfolios include both Bitcoin and Ethereum. In particular, institutional investors looking to diversify may hold positions in both assets. However, technology-centric funds and blockchain venture capitalists are likely to be more bullish on Ethereum, given its variety of use cases and developer activity. 6.3 Market Leadership Shifts Historically, Bitcoin has held the lion’s share of crypto market capitalization. Yet Ethereum has steadily gained ground, thanks to its unique capabilities. As more institutional capital flows into Ether via spot ETFs, we could see periodic shifts in the market dominance dynamic—though Bitcoin’s strong brand and first-mover advantage keep it firmly ahead in many respects. 7. Potential Risks and Challenges 7.1 Regulatory Uncertainty Despite positive steps, the regulatory landscape for crypto remains in flux. Changes in the SEC’s stance, new legislation, or international coordination efforts could impact the future of spot Ethereum ETFs. A sudden shift in policy could temporarily stall inflows or cause issuers to adjust their products. 7.2 Market Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are notorious for extreme price swings. While regulated ETFs can mitigate some risks associated with direct crypto trading—such as hacking or custodial failures—investors remain exposed to Ethereum’s inherent volatility. A steep market correction could trigger rapid outflows, reversing bullish trends. 7.3 Technological Hurdles Ethereum’s network is still evolving. Although ongoing upgrades aim to improve scalability and reduce fees, significant delays or technical failures could undermine investor confidence. Competitor blockchains (e.g., Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Cardano) also challenge Ethereum’s market share if they can deliver faster or cheaper transactions at scale. 7.4 Fee Competition A surge in spot Ethereum ETFs could lead to fee wars. While this is generally beneficial for retail investors, it might put pressure on smaller issuers who cannot compete with larger asset managers on cost. Over time, the market could consolidate around a few major players, reducing the diversity of available products. 8. The Future Outlook for U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs 8.1 Potential for Further Capital Inflows With $2.68 billion in cumulative net inflows to date, the U.S. spot Ethereum ETF market seems poised for further growth. If Ethereum continues to deliver on its technological roadmap and retains developer mindshare, these inflows could accelerate, especially if broader economic conditions encourage alternative investments. 8.2 Impact of Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic factors—such as interest rates, inflation, and recession fears—can influence the appeal of crypto-based products. As investors hunt for non-correlated or risk-adjusted returns, Ether’s role as a versatile digital asset may gain even more prominence, further benefiting spot ETFs. 8.3 Expansion into International Markets Although U.S. approvals carry substantial weight, the global appetite for Ethereum continues to rise. Spot Ethereum ETFs in other regions—like Canada, Europe, and Asia—may also gain traction. Cross-border arbitrage opportunities, institutional partnerships, and regulatory arbitrage could create a more interconnected global market for Ethereum. 8.4 Evolution of Crypto Hedge Funds and Private Funds Institutional appetite for crypto is not limited to ETFs. Hedge funds, venture capital, and private equity firms also look to capitalize on Ethereum-related projects. The success of spot Ethereum ETFs could feed into broader capital flows, as investors become more comfortable allocating a portion of portfolios to digital assets, whether through public-market instruments or private investments. 9. Strategies for Prospective Investors 9.1 Understand the Underlying Asset Before investing in a U.S. spot Ethereum ETF , prospective investors should educate themselves on Ethereum’s fundamentals: its consensus mechanism, utility in DeFi and NFTs, tokenomics, and roadmap. A clear understanding of these aspects helps in assessing Ethereum’s long-term viability. 9.2 Compare ETF Offerings Each ETF has unique characteristics—such as expense ratios, assets under management (AUM), and brand credibility. Reading fund prospectuses and consulting financial advisors can help individuals select the product best suited to their risk tolerance and investment goals. 9.3 Keep an Eye on Regulatory Developments Staying informed about regulatory changes at the SEC, as well as relevant global policy updates, is crucial. Investors should keep track of any new guidelines, tax implications, or compliance requirements that could impact ETF performance or available investment strategies. 9.4 Diversify Your Portfolio Crypto investments can bring volatility, so they are best viewed as a portion of a well-diversified portfolio. Balancing crypto with traditional assets—like stocks, bonds, and real estate—can help manage risk while still allowing exposure to the potential upside of Ethereum. 10. Conclusion The recent $349 million in net inflows for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs underscores Ethereum’s increasing appeal among both institutional and retail investors. Driven by the asset’s robust utility, ongoing technological improvements, and the backing of major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity, Ethereum continues to cement its place as a leading digital asset in the global marketplace. Although the market faces risks from regulatory uncertainties and inherent price volatility, the fundamentals underpinning Ethereum’s smart contract ecosystem remain strong. With a cumulative net inflow of $2.68 billion into spot Ethereum ETFs thus far, and future protocol upgrades slated to enhance the network’s efficiency and scalability, the stage is set for potentially even greater inflows. Investors looking to participate in Ethereum’s growth should conduct thorough due diligence and consider the overall composition of their portfolios. As Ethereum’s ecosystem matures, it may well secure an even larger share of the crypto marketplace, bridging the gap between decentralized technologies and traditional finance in new and transformative ways.

In Q4 2024, cryptocurrency valuations saw a significant surge largely due to the favorable market reaction to the U.S. election results. The total industry market capitalization increased from $1 trillion to $3 trillion during the quarter. Digital Assets Growth And Smart Contract Platforms According to the Crypto Sectors Market Index (CSMI), the digital assets market cap now stands at a level comparable to the global inflation-linked bond market, more than double the size of the U.S. high-yield bond market. However, it noted that, it remains smaller than the global hedge fund industry and the Japanese equity market. Grayscale also noted that the Smart Contract Platforms Crypto Sector is likely the most competitive market segment in the digital assets industry. Regardless of design choices or a network’s strengths and weaknesses, smart contract platforms derive value primarily through their ability to generate network fee revenue. This quarter, the Grayscale Research Top 20 includes the following smart contract platforms: ETH, SOL, SUI, and OP. The Grayscale Research Top 20 Each quarter, Grayscale Research analyzes digital assets to create a Top 20 list of high-potential assets across Crypto Sectors, considering factors like network growth, upcoming catalysts, sustainability of fundamentals, token valuation, token supply inflation, and potential tail risks. The new assets this quarter are HYPE, ENA, VIRTUAL, JUP, JTO, and GRASS. It also added that all the assets in the Top 20 list have high price volatility and should be considered as high-risk. For Q1 2025, Grayscale’s Top 20 list emphasizes on tokens that touch on at least one of the three central market themes: (1) the U.S. election and its impact on industry regulation, especially for decentralized finance (DeFi) and staking; (2) advancements in decentralized AI technologies and blockchain use by AI agents; and (3) growth in the Solana ecosystem. Grayscale noted that based on these themes, the above-mentioned six new assets are being added to the Top 20 list.

38310174,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116134,1735571877,Crypto Experts Divided on the Prospect of an ETH Rally in 2025,"Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has long captivated the crypto community with its groundbreaking technology and diverse use cases. However, despite its long-standing reputation, analysts and market watchers remain divided on the potential for an ETH rally in 2025 . According to a Cointelegraph report on December 30, 2024, leading voices in the crypto industry are torn about Ethereum’s prospects as we inch closer to 2025, pointing to a range of catalysts and headwinds that could shape ETH’s price. CK Zheng, Chief Investment Officer of the crypto hedge fund ZX Squared Capital, is optimistic about Ethereum’s trajectory, largely tying it to the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. Zheng expects crypto-friendly policies to boost liquidity and institutional inflows. Meanwhile, Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, advises caution in the face of a hawkish macroeconomic environment, arguing that Ethereum may struggle to replicate its historical bull runs if interest rates and global monetary tightening persist. In this deep dive, we’ll examine the factors that could propel Ethereum into a robust bull market, the challenges it may face, and the overarching regulatory and macroeconomic considerations. Drawing from historical precedents, cutting-edge technological developments, and expert analyses, this article aims to offer a multifaceted perspective on whether Ethereum truly stands on the cusp of a 2025 rally—or if the crypto community should brace for more tempered outcomes. 1. The Bull Case for an ETH Rally in 2025 1.1 Policy Shift Under a New Administration One of the most talked-about developments in the U.S. crypto landscape is the potential shift in policy under the President-elect Donald Trump administration. CK Zheng from ZX Squared Capital highlights how pro-crypto policies, such as reduced regulatory burdens on digital assets and possible tax incentives, might stimulate growth in the sector. While there is limited clarity on specific legislation, Zheng reasons that any move toward establishing clearer guidelines and friendlier regulations could be a boon for Ethereum. Institutional Inflows : A supportive government policy can lower the perceived risk for large institutional investors. Pensions, hedge funds, and endowments may increase their allocations to Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), DeFi (decentralized finance) projects, or direct holdings in ETH itself. Stable Environment for Innovation : Startups and large corporations alike could be more inclined to develop on the Ethereum blockchain if the legal environment is less ambiguous. This, in turn, may drive demand for ETH and contribute to higher valuations. 1.2 Expanding DeFi Ecosystem and Layer-2 Solutions Ethereum’s hallmark innovation is its smart contract functionality, which has given rise to a vast DeFi ecosystem. Despite competition from other blockchains, Ethereum still hosts the majority of total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications. For a prospective ETH rally in 2025, continued growth in DeFi could serve as a significant catalyst. Layer-2 Rollups : Solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync seek to reduce transaction fees and increase throughput on Ethereum. By alleviating congestion and lowering costs, these layer-2 technologies can help bring new users to DeFi platforms—thereby boosting ETH usage for transaction fees and staking. Innovations in Lending and Borrowing : Lending protocols such as Aave and Compound continue to refine their models. If these platforms see increased institutional participation, it could result in substantial additional demand for ETH. 1.3 Ethereum’s Transition to a Deflationary Model After The Merge (Ethereum’s shift from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake) in 2022, Ethereum has gradually adopted a more deflationary token model, especially once the EIP-1559 burn mechanism is combined with staking. While the supply of ETH isn’t strictly capped like Bitcoin’s, the burn rate combined with staked ETH reduces circulating supply. Staking Participation : As more holders lock up ETH for staking, they effectively remove it from circulation, driving scarcity and potentially propping up the token’s price. Burn Mechanics : EIP-1559, which burns a portion of transaction fees, can turn ETH deflationary in times of high network activity. Over time, this dynamic can reduce supply and buttress ETH’s value. 1.4 Enterprise Adoption of Smart Contracts Beyond speculation, Ethereum’s programmable blockchain has genuine enterprise applications. From supply chain management to identity verification and tokenization of real-world assets, companies can leverage Ethereum’s infrastructure to streamline operations. Widespread corporate adoption in areas like finance, gaming, and logistics could boost demand for ETH, as businesses that rely on Ethereum for mission-critical processes would need to acquire and hold ETH to pay transaction fees. 2. The Bear Case: Why Caution May Be Warranted 2.1 Hawkish Macroeconomic Outlook Markus Thielen of 10x Research posits that a hawkish macroeconomic environment could stifle an ETH rally in 2025. If central banks worldwide maintain higher interest rates to combat inflation, the cost of borrowing remains elevated. This can reduce risk appetite in speculative markets like crypto. Reduced Liquidity : In times of tighter monetary policy, investors often flock to safer assets such as government bonds, draining liquidity from cryptocurrencies. Global Recession Risks : If growth slows and economies slip toward recession, discretionary investments in assets like ETH could contract, leading to weaker demand and price underperformance. 2.2 Competition from Other Blockchains While Ethereum is dominant in smart contract functionality, rivals like Solana, Cardano, and Polkadot are constantly innovating. Some of these protocols offer faster transaction speeds or different consensus mechanisms. A critical question is whether Ethereum can maintain its lead if alternative chains successfully attract more developers, dApps, and users. Scalability Concerns : Even with layer-2 solutions, Ethereum may still struggle to scale if demand surges beyond certain thresholds. Competing networks might take advantage of these choke points to market their platforms as cheaper and faster. Fragmentation of DeFi : If DeFi capital disperses across multiple blockchains, Ethereum’s share of total value locked (TVL) might shrink, impacting the demand for ETH. 2.3 Regulatory and Legislative Setbacks While CK Zheng is optimistic about a favorable regulatory climate, the reality could be more nuanced. Crypto-related bills could get stuck in Congress due to partisan disagreements or overshadowed by larger economic concerns. Moreover, if the administration decides to crack down on certain aspects of DeFi or NFTs, it could dampen enthusiasm for Ethereum-based applications. SEC Enforcement : The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to scrutinize tokens that could be deemed securities. If the SEC takes a more aggressive stance on Ethereum or its DeFi ecosystem, the market could face uncertainty. Tax and Reporting Regulations : Stringent tax reporting requirements might discourage casual investors. If the cost of compliance becomes too high, inflows to crypto assets could slow. 2.4 Risk of Overleveraged Markets Crypto booms often see an influx of leveraged trading, with investors using borrowed funds to amplify their gains. While this can fuel rapid price increases, it also sets the stage for severe corrections when prices dip. A wave of liquidations can intensify sell pressure, leading to a domino effect. Should leverage once again become rampant in the crypto market, a seemingly bullish phase for ETH might suddenly implode under the wrong conditions. 3. The Significance of Historical Patterns 3.1 Ethereum’s Past Cycles Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has experienced multiple boom-and-bust cycles. During the ICO mania of 2017, ETH soared from under $10 to nearly $1,400, only to crash by over 90% during the subsequent bear market. Similarly, the DeFi summer of 2020 and the NFT craze of 2021 propelled ETH to new all-time highs before prices cooled. Volatility Is the Norm : These historical patterns suggest that Ethereum can appreciate dramatically during bull runs but also retrace significantly. If 2025 coincides with another bull cycle, ETH could see substantial gains. However, predicting the exact timing remains challenging. Correlation With Bitcoin Halving : Some analysts track Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycles, noting that altcoins, including ETH, often follow BTC’s lead. The next halving for Bitcoin is slated for spring 2024, which might set the stage for a market-wide bullish trend that extends into 2025. 3.2 Institutional Trends Institutional interest in crypto has risen steadily. Major financial institutions now offer crypto custody services, and spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum have garnered billions in inflows. Should this trend continue—especially if market conditions turn bullish—Ethereum could see a second wave of institutional adoption. ETF Impact : Spot Ethereum ETFs can simplify the purchase process for investors who prefer brokerage accounts over crypto exchanges. This streamlined access has the potential to bring in more capital. Treasury Diversification : Some corporations have already dipped their toes into digital assets. A more robust macro environment and clarified regulations might encourage further treasury diversification into ETH. 4. Technological Developments That Could Drive Ether’s Price 4.1 Sharding and Full Scalability Sharding is a critical piece of Ethereum’s roadmap aimed at partitioning the network to handle more transactions in parallel. If fully implemented, sharding could dramatically increase Ethereum’s throughput, solving one of the most persistent bottlenecks. Lower Fees : Reduced congestion would lead to cheaper transactions, making DeFi more accessible. Mainstream Adoption : Gaming, metaverse projects, and mainstream financial applications could flourish on Ethereum if high fees and slow processing times become a thing of the past. 4.2 Upgrades to Layer-2 and Cross-Chain Interoperability While rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism are already operational, further advancements could see these solutions become even more efficient. Additionally, cross-chain bridges and interoperability protocols can allow liquidity to flow freely between Ethereum and other networks. Seamless User Experience : If users can interact with Ethereum-based dApps without worrying about high fees or complex bridging procedures, the onboarding process becomes less daunting, potentially driving exponential growth in user adoption. Shared Liquidity : Interoperability fosters a more unified ecosystem, strengthening Ethereum’s position as a central hub for DeFi and NFTs. 4.3 DeFi 2.0 and Beyond The next phase of DeFi, sometimes referred to as DeFi 2.0, focuses on protocol-owned liquidity, better capital efficiency, and more user-friendly interfaces. If these innovations thrive on Ethereum, the network could see another wave of investor enthusiasm, rivaling the DeFi summer of 2020. Enhanced Yield Opportunities : Protocols that offer stable yields or interesting tokenomics might attract a new demographic of risk-averse investors. Institutional-Grade Solutions : Firms may seek out DeFi platforms with robust security audits and compliance-friendly frameworks, further legitimizing the space. 5. Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Overlays 5.1 Global Monetary Policy Central banks worldwide could either fuel or dampen crypto markets based on policy directions. If inflation stabilizes and interest rates come down, liquidity could flow back into risk assets, including Ethereum. Conversely, persistent inflation or rising interest rates might keep risk-on sentiment at bay. 5.2 Fiscal Policies and Stimulus Governments might deploy stimulus measures to counteract economic downturns. If such stimulus leads to more cash in circulation, some portion could find its way into crypto markets. Historically, expansionary fiscal policies have boosted investor appetite for alternative assets. 5.3 Geopolitical Instability Geopolitical tensions, trade wars, or conflicts can drive some investors to look for assets outside the traditional system. While gold has historically served as a safe haven, digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have entered the conversation as alternative hedges. Though ETH might not be the first choice for “flight to safety,” heightened global uncertainties can put a spotlight on digital currencies in general. 6. Considering Both Sides: Strategies for Investors 6.1 Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) For those convinced of Ethereum’s long-term potential but wary of near-term volatility, dollar-cost averaging can be an effective strategy. By investing a fixed amount periodically, investors spread out their cost basis and mitigate the risk of entering at market peaks. 6.2 Portfolio Diversification Ethereum offers unique utility, but it’s still an asset prone to significant price fluctuations. Investors might blend Ethereum holdings with Bitcoin, stablecoins, equities, and bonds to balance overall portfolio risk. The 60/40 Model Update : Some modern portfolio theorists suggest a small crypto allocation (1-10%) alongside traditional assets to enhance returns without drastically increasing volatility. Other Layer-1 Tokens : Allocating a portion of one’s crypto funds to competing blockchains could hedge against Ethereum’s potential underperformance if rivals gain traction. 6.3 Identifying On-Chain Metrics Tools like on-chain analytics can help gauge Ethereum’s network usage and investor sentiment. Monitoring addresses with large ETH holdings (whales), exchange flows, and staking metrics can offer clues about market direction. ETH Locked in Smart Contracts : An uptick in ETH locked in DeFi protocols might signify growing adoption, potentially foreshadowing price appreciation. Staking Ratios : If staking participation surges, it reduces circulating supply, potentially acting as a price catalyst. 6.4 Risk Management and Exit Plans No matter how bullish one is on Ethereum, having a clear exit plan or risk management strategy is crucial. This could involve setting stop-loss orders, taking partial profits at targeted price levels, or reallocating funds in response to changing market conditions. 7. Expert Outlook: Bridging the Divide Crypto markets often hinge on sentiment swings, with many experts basing predictions on evolving fundamentals. While CK Zheng foresees a major bull run supported by pro-crypto policies and inflows, Markus Thielen emphasizes that global economic forces and risk-on appetites should not be taken for granted. Key Points of Divergence Policy Clarity : Zheng believes the upcoming administration will facilitate a more welcoming regulatory environment. Thielen is less convinced, citing potential legislative inertia. Liquidity Crunch : Thielen points to ongoing liquidity headwinds in a tightening macro backdrop, whereas Zheng projects an influx of capital from institutions and crypto-native funds if regulations become clearer. Timing of the Rally : Even among optimists, opinions differ regarding the timing of a potential run. Some expect mid-2025, while others foresee a delay until late 2025 or even beyond, depending on how macro and regulatory conditions unfold. 8. Conclusion The prospect of an ETH rally in 2025 hangs in the balance, tethered to an intricate web of policy shifts, technological developments, competitive pressures, and macroeconomic forces. On one side, bullish believers like CK Zheng argue that an administration keen on supporting digital assets, coupled with Ethereum’s continuous evolution—layer-2 rollups, staking, and enterprise adoption—could catapult ETH into a new stratosphere. Conversely, skeptics like Markus Thielen caution that a hawkish macroeconomic backdrop, regulatory uncertainty, and mounting competition from rival blockchains could temper Ethereum’s growth prospects. Investors eyeing Ethereum must therefore navigate both optimism and caution. While the network’s fundamentals—smart contract capabilities, developer community, and forward-looking upgrades—suggest robust long-term potential, short-term volatility and external headwinds remain unavoidable. Whether 2025 heralds a bull run for Ethereum or simply another chapter in its cyclical journey, staying informed, applying prudent risk management, and diversifying remain pivotal strategies for anyone betting on the future of decentralized technology.

38310172,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116140,1735571793,BTC Rally in 2025: Matrixport Predicts Bitcoin Consolidation Before Next Bull Run,"BTC rally in 2025 is quickly becoming a hot topic among crypto enthusiasts and market analysts alike. According to a recent post on X (formerly Twitter) by crypto service provider Matrixport, Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be in a short consolidation phase after significant gains in the past few weeks. The data shows BTC futures open interest skyrocketing to $29 billion—a 50% jump from October’s $18 billion. Historically, such a surge in futures positions signals that a bull run is likely to continue once the market digests recent gains. With the holiday season often bringing comparatively low trading volumes, many traders are eagerly watching for fresh capital inflows that could push Bitcoin prices to new highs—potentially setting the stage for the much-discussed BTC rally in 2025 . In this in-depth analysis, we’ll break down Matrixport’s insights, examine Bitcoin’s historical patterns, discuss the significance of futures open interest, and explore how macroeconomic and market-specific catalysts might converge to propel BTC toward a sustained bull run in the coming year. We’ll also consider potential roadblocks and risk factors that could temper near-term enthusiasm. By the end, readers should have a well-rounded perspective on why the BTC rally in 2025 is on the radar for many experts and whether these predictions stand on solid ground. 1. Matrixport’s Stance: Consolidation Before a Bullish Push 1.1 Observing the Market After Recent Gains Matrixport highlights that Bitcoin has been “digesting its gains” following a strong price run-up in November and early December. After periods of rapid appreciation, it’s common for BTC to enter a consolidation phase where momentum stalls, trading volumes drop, and price action becomes range-bound. This pause can serve as a “cooling-off” period, allowing investors to lock in profits and reset expectations for the next major move. 1.2 Futures Open Interest: A Classic Signal? The crypto service provider underlines that BTC futures open interest has soared to $29 billion—up from $18 billion in October. Open interest measures the total value of outstanding derivative contracts yet to be settled. When open interest rises significantly amid relatively flat price action, it can signify that traders are building positions in anticipation of a breakout. Historical data often shows that after a consolidation period, these larger futures positions help fuel stronger price movements, potentially accelerating a rally. 1.3 Low Holiday Volumes and New Capital Inflows One of the intriguing points mentioned by Matrixport is the tendency for trading activity to slow down during the Christmas and New Year holidays. Low volumes can lead to short-lived price volatility, but historically, new capital inflows in January—often spurred by fresh investment goals or broader macro shifts—have played a role in revitalizing BTC’s price. If history repeats itself, the stage may be set for a resumption of the bull trend leading into 2025. 2. A Look at Bitcoin’s Historical Patterns 2.1 Bitcoin’s Four-Year Cycle Much of the crypto market’s bullish sentiment regarding a BTC rally in 2025 revolves around Bitcoin’s widely discussed four-year cycle, driven in part by the halving event. Every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years), Bitcoin’s mining reward is cut in half, reducing the new BTC supply entering the market. First Phase (Post-Halving) : Historically, after the halving, Bitcoin’s price sees a run-up as supply tightens, and bullish sentiment grows. Second Phase (Price Discovery) : BTC reaches new all-time highs, driving massive media coverage and significant retail FOMO (fear of missing out). Third Phase (Consolidation/Bear Market) : Eventually, the market corrects, leading to an extended bear phase or consolidation period. Fourth Phase (Pre-Halving Run-Up) : As anticipation builds for the next halving, the cycle restarts, often accompanied by renewed optimism and capital inflows. The next Bitcoin halving is expected in April or May 2024. Historically, the post-halving year (which would be 2025 in this case) often sees robust upside momentum. If this pattern holds, the BTC rally in 2025 might coincide neatly with the halving cycle’s historical trend. 2.2 Consolidation as a Precursor to Volatility Bitcoin’s price patterns frequently display a consolidation phase that paves the way for high volatility. During these lulls, open interest in futures may climb as traders position themselves for an anticipated big move. In some instances, short squeezes or sudden spikes in demand can trigger rapid price expansions, culminating in strong upward trends. Matrixport’s analysis suggests that this “calm before the storm” approach might be unfolding once again. 2.3 Seasonal Market Effects Seasonality also plays a subtle role. The end of the year, marked by the holiday season, often brings lower trading volumes. In crypto’s early days, December was notorious for dramatic price movements—both upward and downward—but as institutional involvement increases, patterns have become less predictable. However, it’s not unusual for the market to see an uptick in January as traders recalibrate strategies. 3. The Role of Futures Markets and Open Interest 3.1 Why Open Interest Matters Open interest serves as a proxy for trader participation and conviction in a particular market. When more money flows into futures contracts without a corresponding price move, it often signals that traders are building leveraged positions. A high open interest can amplify price movements once a breakout or breakdown occurs. Long vs. Short Dynamics : When a large number of traders hold long positions, they anticipate a price increase. If BTC’s price rises, these positions can become profitable quickly, fueling even more buying. Conversely, if the market moves against them, a cascade of liquidations can lead to abrupt sell-offs. Potential for Volatility : High open interest magnifies Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. It’s a double-edged sword—leading to sharper upward rallies when sentiment is bullish, but also steeper crashes if the market turns bearish. 3.2 Futures as a Hedge or Speculative Instrument Institutional investors often use Bitcoin futures to hedge existing spot positions, minimizing their downside risk. Retail traders and crypto-focused hedge funds, on the other hand, may treat futures as a leveraged betting tool, hoping to maximize returns. The interplay between hedging and speculation can create a tug-of-war that keeps BTC prices range-bound before a decisive catalyst. 3.3 Futures vs. Options: Different Market Signals While the recent focus is on futures open interest, Bitcoin’s options market can also offer insights into sentiment. Options, which allow traders to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a specific price, can reveal whether market participants expect significant volatility. However, Matrixport’s emphasis on futures open interest indicates that, for now, futures sentiment is painting a bullish outlook—at least when it comes to building positions ahead of potential price action. 4. Macro Drivers Influencing a 2025 Rally 4.1 Monetary Policy and Interest Rates Cryptocurrency markets have become increasingly sensitive to global monetary policy. When central banks keep interest rates low or engage in quantitative easing, liquidity often flows into riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Potential Rate Cuts : If inflation pressures subside, central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve might pivot toward more accommodative policies in 2024 or early 2025. This shift could funnel capital back into BTC. Flight to Quality : Conversely, if global uncertainty remains high or if central banks maintain restrictive policies, investors could view Bitcoin as a digital store of value alongside gold, reinforcing a bullish narrative. 4.2 Institutional Adoption Institutional participation has steadily climbed in recent years, with major financial institutions offering crypto custody services and including BTC on their balance sheets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs : Approvals of spot BTC ETFs in various jurisdictions have already injected liquidity into the market. Further adoption or regulatory clarity could dramatically boost inflows, supporting a 2025 rally. Corporate Treasuries : Some companies consider BTC an inflation hedge or a diversifying asset. If more firms follow suit, the added demand could drive prices upward. 4.3 Technological Developments While Bitcoin lacks the smart contract functionality of Ethereum or other altcoins, ongoing improvements to the Bitcoin protocol—such as developments around the Lightning Network—aim to enhance scalability and reduce fees. Any breakthrough that makes Bitcoin transactions faster, cheaper, and more convenient could solidify its position as a global digital currency, encouraging further investment. 5. Potential Roadblocks to a BTC Bull Run 5.1 Regulatory Hurdles Regulatory uncertainty remains a dominant theme. Governments worldwide grapple with how to classify, tax, and oversee cryptocurrencies. Sudden crackdowns or unfavorable legislation could dampen the bullish sentiment leading into 2025. U.S. SEC Enforcement : The SEC has become more active in enforcing securities laws for certain crypto projects. Although Bitcoin is generally considered a commodity rather than a security, an aggressive regulatory stance on related products or exchanges could create indirect headwinds. Global Divergence : Different countries have adopted varied stances—from El Salvador’s pro-Bitcoin approach to China’s strict clampdowns. This patchwork regulatory environment can cause uncertainty for institutional investors wary of cross-border complexities. 5.2 Market Manipulation and Volatility Bitcoin’s market has matured significantly, but manipulation tactics—from wash trading to coordinated pump-and-dumps—still occasionally raise concerns. In a leveraged market with high open interest, sudden price swings can inflict major losses or cause forced liquidations. This volatility can spook new participants and hamper broader adoption. 5.3 Competition from Altcoins and Other Assets With thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation, Bitcoin competes for investor attention. While many view BTC as digital gold, some altcoins offer faster transaction times or advanced features. Additionally, traditional assets like commodities or tech stocks might become more appealing if macro conditions shift—diverting funds away from BTC. 6. Strategies for Traders Eyeing the 2025 Landscape 6.1 Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Given Bitcoin’s volatility, many long-term investors choose dollar-cost averaging—investing a fixed amount at regular intervals—to mitigate the risk of entering the market at its peak. If a BTC rally in 2025 materializes, those who DCA’d might benefit from a lower average entry price and smoother emotional roller coaster. 6.2 Monitoring On-Chain Data Beyond futures open interest, on-chain metrics—like active addresses, hash rate, and transaction volumes—can offer clues about network health and user adoption. A robust on-chain picture, coupled with rising futures positions, often precedes strong rallies. 6.3 Staying Alert to External Cues Macro events such as Federal Reserve announcements, global economic data, or geopolitical tensions can spur quick moves in the Bitcoin market. Traders should remain vigilant, adjusting their strategies based on these broader developments. A hawkish Fed stance might trigger a temporary pullback, while signals of economic easing could fuel aggressive BTC buying. 6.4 Balancing Leverage and Risk Management High open interest in the futures market underscores the potential for significant price moves. While leverage can amplify gains, it equally amplifies losses. Traders may consider prudent position sizing, stop-loss orders, and portfolio diversification to manage risk effectively. 7. The Broader Crypto Ecosystem and BTC Correlations 7.1 Intermarket Relationships Bitcoin frequently serves as the gateway to the broader crypto market. In a bull phase, altcoins often follow BTC’s lead. However, correlations can diverge as each project faces unique fundamentals. A strong BTC rally might catalyze an altcoin season, but it could also cannibalize attention if BTC becomes the primary focus of new inflows. 7.2 Influence of Stablecoins Stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and BUSD serve as on-ramps for crypto trading, offering a buffer against volatility. They also provide liquidity across decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized exchanges. If stablecoin supply grows in tandem with increased futures open interest, it signals robust demand for digital assets—potentially supporting Bitcoin’s price momentum. 7.3 Ethereum and Other Layer-1s While Bitcoin holds the “digital gold” narrative, Ethereum and other layer-1 blockchains are evolving rapidly, showcasing features like smart contracts, NFTs, and DeFi ecosystems. Sometimes, capital rotates out of BTC into these alternative ecosystems for higher returns, which could temporarily dampen BTC’s upside. Conversely, a thriving altcoin market can also bring fresh investors into crypto, some of whom may ultimately gravitate toward Bitcoin. 8. Timing the Market vs. Time in the Market 8.1 The Allure of “Buy Low, Sell High” “Buy low, sell high” remains a simple but elusive mantra in trading. Attempting to time exact market tops and bottoms is notoriously difficult, especially in a relatively young and sentiment-driven market like crypto. While some traders excel at short-term speculation, others may find value in a longer-term approach based on fundamental convictions. 8.2 The Halving Effect and the 2025 Thesis Many analysts correlate BTC’s most dramatic bull runs with the halving cycle. If a 2025 rally aligns with post-halving dynamics, staying invested—or at least partially exposed—could be the winning strategy. Nonetheless, black swan events (global crises, unprecedented regulatory clampdowns, or major tech failures) can disrupt even the most historically consistent patterns. 8.3 Psychological Cycles in Crypto The crypto market is often driven as much by psychology as by fundamentals. Fear and greed indicators, social media sentiment, and media coverage can all tip the scales. During consolidation phases, “fear of missing out” (FOMO) can take a back seat, but it can return swiftly once prices break key resistance levels. Matrixport’s call for a 2025 bull run suggests that once the market resolves its current consolidation, FOMO could erupt again—potentially pushing BTC to record highs. 9. Outlook: Why 2025 Could Be a Pivotal Year 9.1 Converging Catalysts Halving Cycle : Historically, Bitcoin’s supply constraint post-halving propels interest and price appreciation. Institutional Maturity : Spot ETFs, greater financial infrastructure, and heightened corporate adoption suggest deeper liquidity pools. Macroeconomic Shifts : Potential loosening of monetary policies (if inflation eases) could send investors back into risk-on territory, including crypto. Technological Confidence : Bitcoin’s track record of secure block production and the ongoing development of Layer-2 solutions (e.g., Lightning Network) foster long-term confidence. 9.2 Market Participation from Diverse Groups Retail Investors : Remain highly influential, especially when media coverage sparks excitement about new BTC all-time highs. Institutional Funds : Pension funds, hedge funds, and major banks that have begun dabbling in Bitcoin may increase their positions if they see strong risk-adjusted returns. High-Net-Worth Individuals : The “digital gold” narrative could attract those seeking a hedge against macro uncertainty. 9.3 Risks Not to Be Ignored While optimism for a BTC rally in 2025 is growing, risks remain. Macro headwinds, unforeseen regulations, security incidents (e.g., exchange hacks), or a major push from competing assets could sideline the bullish thesis. Prudent investors keep contingency plans and set realistic expectations in case the rally fails to materialize on the anticipated timeline—or at all. 10. Conclusion Matrixport’s assessment that Bitcoin is in a short-term consolidation phase, paired with elevated futures open interest, has sparked renewed conversation about the likelihood of a BTC rally in 2025 . Historical trends, particularly the four-year halving cycle, lend credence to the possibility of a major uptrend. Meanwhile, an environment of low holiday trading volumes and prospective capital inflows in the new year could be the final pieces of the puzzle for a renewed bull run. On the flip side, various macro and micro factors—ranging from regulatory uncertainty to rising competition from altcoins—underscore that no rally is guaranteed. The interplay between institutional inflows and retail enthusiasm, combined with developments in global monetary policy, will shape Bitcoin’s destiny. Some investors are content to “hodl” (hold on for dear life) and let the market cycle run its course, while others employ targeted trading strategies to capitalize on volatility. Regardless of one’s approach, it’s clear that the conversation surrounding Bitcoin’s next major price movement is shifting toward 2025. If Bitcoin navigates the waters of regulation, competition, and short-term consolidation successfully, we could see an historic surge that cements BTC’s role in the global financial landscape. Yet as any seasoned crypto participant knows, the market rarely moves in a straight line. For now, traders and investors watch closely for signals—like new capital inflows, bullish policy shifts, or a macroeconomic pivot—that could confirm the prophecy of a BTC rally in 2025 .

38310114,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116144,1735571721,Crypto.com Partnership with Dubai Islamic Bank: Gateway to the UAE and GCC Markets,"Crypto.com partnership with Dubai Islamic Bank has captured the attention of the fintech and crypto communities worldwide, marking a pivotal moment for the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency exchange’s foothold in the Middle East. On December 30, 2024, the Singapore-based exchange announced on its official website that it signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB), the largest Islamic bank in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and a global leader in Islamic finance. This partnership not only cements Crypto.com’s growing presence in the UAE but also lays the groundwork for a broader market expansion across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. With Crypto.com’s formidable global reach and DIB’s well-established reputation for Sharia-compliant financial solutions, this alliance is poised to introduce millions of potential customers to new digital asset services that meet the religious and cultural expectations of the Islamic finance community. Below, we take a deep dive into the significance of this partnership, its potential impact on crypto adoption in the UAE and beyond, and the broader trends shaping the future of Islamic banking and cryptocurrency. 1. Background: Islamic Finance and Crypto 1.1 The Growth of Islamic Finance Islamic finance, guided by the principles of Sharia (Islamic law), is grounded in the prohibition of interest (riba), speculative transactions (gharar), and investments in prohibited (haram) industries. Over the years, the Islamic finance sector has surged in popularity, particularly in Muslim-majority countries and among communities looking for ethical banking options. According to various industry reports, Islamic finance assets are valued at well over $2 trillion globally, with projections suggesting sustained growth as more institutions incorporate Sharia-compliant services. Given its emphasis on ethical investment, risk-sharing, and tangible economic value, Islamic finance has often faced difficulties reconciling modern banking practices with religious principles. However, as fintech solutions emerge, there is a budding opportunity to align innovative financial products with Islamic rules—opening the door for Sharia-compliant bonds (sukuk), Islamic insurance (takaful), and now, cryptocurrency services. 1.2 Cryptocurrency in Islamic Finance Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, stirred debates among Islamic scholars on whether digital assets meet the requirements of Sharia compliance. Some scholars have raised concerns about volatility, speculative activity, and the uncertain nature of underlying assets. Yet, as blockchain technology matures and regulations emerge, an increasing number of Islamic financial institutions recognize the potential of digital assets—provided these products are structured in a manner consistent with Islamic principles. Projects like OneGram (a gold-backed cryptocurrency) and Islamic Coin have surfaced, aiming to blend crypto innovation with Islamic values. This has paved the way for mainstream players like Crypto.com to partner with leading Islamic banks, bridging the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and Sharia-compliant frameworks. 2. The Significance of Crypto.com’s MoU with Dubai Islamic Bank 2.1 Why Dubai Islamic Bank? Founded in 1975, Dubai Islamic Bank is a trailblazer in the global Islamic banking ecosystem. Renowned for pioneering contemporary Sharia-compliant banking models, DIB has amassed a customer base spanning corporate, retail, and institutional clients. Its leadership position in the UAE—one of the world’s leading financial hubs—affords it immense influence over the adoption of new banking products and technologies. Partnering with DIB offers Crypto.com immediate credibility and market access. By aligning with a bank that adheres strictly to Sharia principles, the exchange can more smoothly introduce its services to devout Muslim customers and the broader population in the UAE. Furthermore, DIB’s track record in financial innovation and robust compliance protocols could expedite the integration of crypto solutions into mainstream Islamic finance. 2.2 Expanding Across the GCC Region The UAE is part of the GCC, a regional bloc that also includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Qatar. Each state maintains a robust banking sector, with wide-ranging approaches to Islamic finance. Should Crypto.com’s collaboration with DIB prove successful, it may serve as a template for expanding into other GCC markets, replicating the model of Sharia-compliant crypto offerings throughout the region. By leveraging DIB’s deep-rooted connections, Crypto.com could potentially navigate regulatory landscapes across GCC countries more efficiently. Whether through additional MoUs or strategic alliances with other Islamic banks, Crypto.com stands to gain a strong competitive edge in a market ripe for digital innovation—particularly one that balances tradition with modernity. 2.3 Strengthening Dubai’s Position as a Crypto Hub Dubai has steadily been cementing itself as a global crypto hub. Initiatives like the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and free zones such as the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) exemplify the city’s push to create a supportive regulatory environment for digital assets. At the same time, Dubai’s leadership invests significantly in blockchain-related infrastructures (e.g., the Dubai Blockchain Strategy). By partnering with DIB, a locally founded and headquartered institution, Crypto.com ingratiates itself further with Dubai’s vision. The MoU underscores how seriously the city takes regulated crypto offerings, not only for conventional investors but also for those seeking Sharia-aligned products. This synergy may attract foreign businesses, investors, and innovators to Dubai’s blockchain ecosystem, bolstering the city’s reputation in the global crypto community. 3. Partnership Objectives and Potential Offerings 3.1 Sharia-Compliant Crypto Products One of the primary ambitions of this partnership is likely the launch of Sharia-compliant crypto services. Although specifics of the MoU are not yet publicly disclosed, these services could include: Halal Crypto Savings Accounts : Customers may deposit funds in crypto savings accounts that uphold Islamic principles, possibly paired with ethically structured returns. Tokenized Sukuk : Sukuk (Islamic bonds) issuance on blockchain platforms could streamline settlement and transparency while retaining compliance with Sharia guidelines. P2P Lending Platforms : Applying DeFi methodologies to Islamic finance might produce interest-free (or profit-sharing) lending models that circumvent riba. By adopting Sharia-compliant methods, Crypto.com and DIB can tap into the growing demand for ethical finance solutions in the Middle East and beyond. 3.2 Education and Outreach Another critical aspect of this collaboration may involve raising awareness and educating consumers about cryptocurrencies. Misconceptions persist within the Islamic finance community concerning crypto’s permissibility. If DIB and Crypto.com intend to onboard a broad user base, they must address these misconceptions head-on, providing resources on the theological and financial rationale behind Sharia-compliant crypto solutions. Workshops and Conferences : Co-hosted events could shed light on the intricacies of Islamic finance and cryptocurrencies, highlighting real-world use cases. Academic Partnerships : Collaborations with Islamic universities or research centers might produce in-depth studies or fatwas (legal opinions) on the status of crypto. 3.3 Streamlined Access to Crypto via Traditional Bank Channels Historically, one of the main obstacles to crypto adoption has been the “fiat on-ramp” challenge—how to convert local currencies into cryptocurrencies quickly and securely. Traditional banks often hesitate to process crypto-related transactions, partially due to regulatory uncertainty. By directly partnering with DIB, Crypto.com could facilitate seamless fiat-to-crypto conversions for customers within the DIB ecosystem. Clients might be able to purchase digital assets, manage crypto portfolios, and use specialized debit cards linked to their Islamic bank accounts—all in a manner consistent with Sharia guidelines. 4. The Broader UAE and GCC Crypto Landscape 4.1 Existing Crypto Regulations in the UAE Long recognized for its business-friendly environment, the UAE has advanced numerous regulatory frameworks to foster the development of blockchain and crypto solutions. Some of the relevant initiatives include: Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) : The ADGM’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) has published comprehensive guidelines for digital asset regulation, licensing crypto exchanges, and token offerings. Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) : Established to regulate virtual assets, VARA has introduced licensing regimes aimed at ensuring investor protection and market stability. Such measures aim to bolster public trust in crypto platforms, mitigate fraud, and support the country’s ambitions to be a global hub for digital innovation. 4.2 GCC-Wide Opportunities The GCC’s combined population is over 57 million and boasts some of the world’s highest GDP per capita figures. With a collective focus on economic diversification (beyond oil and gas), these countries are actively seeking cutting-edge technologies—crypto included. Partnerships with major Islamic financial institutions could be replicated in markets like Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, each with its own unique regulatory environment and consumer base. Furthermore, cross-border digital asset transfers within the GCC can be expedited if banks champion blockchain solutions. By offering streamlined remittance services, microfinance platforms, and multi-currency payment gateways, crypto could become a vital pillar in the region’s economic transformation. 5. Challenges and Considerations 5.1 Regulatory Hurdles Despite the UAE’s progress, crypto regulations can still be complex, with each emirate or financial free zone possibly having distinct guidelines. Regulatory Fragmentation could delay the rollout of new services, as DIB and Crypto.com must reconcile different compliance frameworks. Additionally, cross-border transactions or expansions into other GCC states might introduce more layers of legal intricacy. 5.2 Ensuring Sharia Compliance One critical challenge for any crypto venture aiming to capture the Islamic finance market is obtaining credible and respected Sharia certifications. This process involves: Sharia Board Reviews : A council of qualified scholars must examine the technical and financial structure of crypto products, ensuring they don’t involve interest or excessive speculation. Continuous Oversight : Beyond the initial certification, operational processes need periodic auditing and real-time monitoring to maintain adherence to Islamic principles. Achieving and retaining Sharia compliance is an ongoing commitment, requiring strong governance and a willingness to adapt product structures if they ever fall short of Islamic standards. 5.3 Investor and Consumer Education While crypto adoption grows globally, many consumers remain unsure about how digital assets work—let alone the complexities of Islamic finance. Lack of Clarity on risk management, volatility, or the underlying blockchain technology can deter potential users. Thorough educational campaigns, guided user onboarding, and robust customer support will be crucial in dispelling doubts and misconceptions. 5.4 Market Volatility Cryptocurrencies are famously volatile, an aspect that may raise red flags within the conservative realm of Islamic finance. Even if a product is structured to be Sharia-compliant, sharp price swings can be seen as a form of excessive speculation (maysir). To address this concern, Crypto.com and DIB might explore stablecoins or asset-backed tokens that mitigate drastic price fluctuations, providing a safer entry point into the crypto world. 6. Global Implications for Islamic Crypto Adoption 6.1 Setting a Global Precedent If the Crypto.com-DIB partnership successfully rolls out user-friendly, Sharia-compliant crypto services, it could become a benchmark for Islamic finance worldwide. Financial institutions in Malaysia, Turkey, Indonesia, and other Muslim-majority countries might look to replicate similar models, tapping into digital asset markets while retaining religious tenets. This would further unify the global Islamic financial community’s approach to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. 6.2 Advancing Halal Investments A successful deployment of Islamic finance solutions in crypto can bolster the concept of “halal investing” on a global scale. Halal investment funds, Sharia-compliant indices, and integrated digital wallets might become commonplace, opening channels for trillions of dollars in Islamic finance assets to flow into regulated crypto markets. 6.3 Strengthening Crypto Legitimacy Collaborations between reputable Islamic financial institutions and established crypto entities reinforce the notion that cryptocurrencies can be integrated into mainstream financial systems. Addressing theological, regulatory, and operational challenges signals to skeptics that the crypto ecosystem is mature and diversified enough to serve distinct markets. 7. Future Outlook and Opportunities 7.1 Expansion into DeFi for Islamic Banking One of the most promising frontiers for Islamic finance lies in decentralized finance (DeFi). Protocols that eliminate intermediaries could resonate with some Islamic principles, such as risk-sharing and transparency. Innovations might include: Profit-Sharing Lending Pools : Instead of earning interest, participants split profits from approved ventures, aligning with Islamic finance’s participatory model. Asset-Backed Tokens : Real-world assets like real estate or commodities could be tokenized, providing tangible backing for Sharia-compliant investments. A successful Crypto.com-DIB partnership could accelerate DeFi experimentation within Islamic finance. 7.2 Tapping into Remittances and Cross-Border Payments The GCC countries host a large expatriate population, and remittances form a significant economic channel. Blockchain-powered payment solutions can drastically reduce transfer fees and settlement times, making them extremely appealing. By providing Sharia-compliant, cost-effective remittance services, both Crypto.com and DIB can tap into a crucial market, potentially dominating corridor flows between the GCC and other regions like South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. 7.3 Corporate and Government Collaborations Should Crypto.com and DIB demonstrate tangible results, government entities and large corporations may be next to explore blockchain solutions for supply chain management, secure data storage, and more. Islamic finance solutions that leverage tokenization and smart contracts could streamline processes like sukuk issuance for infrastructure projects or ESG-focused investments. 8. Conclusion The Crypto.com partnership with Dubai Islamic Bank represents a significant milestone, not only for both organizations but for the broader landscape of Islamic finance and cryptocurrency. By combining the global reach of a top-tier crypto exchange with the Sharia-compliant banking acumen of DIB, this collaboration aims to unlock new opportunities for consumers seeking ethical, transparent, and technologically advanced financial products. If successfully executed, the partnership could set a global precedent, paving the way for further innovation in Islamic fintech and bridging the gap between decentralized assets and traditional Sharia governance. Still, the journey is not without its hurdles. Regulatory fragmentation, the need for continuous Sharia oversight, market volatility, and consumer education remain pressing concerns. Yet, if Crypto.com and DIB navigate these challenges effectively, they could pioneer a new era of Islamic finance—one where crypto assets and blockchain solutions enrich existing services and ultimately deliver on the promise of financial inclusion and economic empowerment. In many ways, the future of this partnership is a microcosm of the broader crypto industry’s trajectory: collaboration with established institutions, a push for compliant frameworks, and the pursuit of real-world utility. As Dubai continues to solidify its stance as a global crypto hub, innovative alliances like this one will play a crucial role in shaping both the local and international fintech ecosystems.

38320772,https://thecoinrise.com/fartcoins-boat-sailed-for-you-dont-worry-btfd-got-you-covered-with-90-apy/,1735571720,"Fartcoin’s Boat Sailed for You? Don’t Worry, BTFD Got You Covered with 90% APY","Meme coins have been stealing the spotlight in the crypto world for years now. What started as a joke with Dogecoin turned into a global phenomenon. But lately, new players like BTFD Coin (BTFD) and Fartcoin (FRTC) are taking this trend to a whole new level. These two meme coins might make you laugh at first glance, but their presale performances and promises for the future are no joke. BTFD Coin , short for “Buy The F***ing Dip,” is hyped for its killer Play2Earn (P2E) game, juicy staking rewards, and a referral program that’ll make you want to tell your whole squad. On the other hand, Fartcoin is turning heads with its humor-driven marketing strategy and utility plans tied to its NFT marketplace and community-driven rewards. Let’s break it down and see which of these meme coins deserves your hard-earned cash. BTFD Coin: The Underdog Making Big Moves Alright, let’s talk about BTFD Coin’s presale which started at $0.000004 per coin and is now in Stage 13, priced at $0.0000142. Yeah, you read that right. From its humble beginnings, it’s already raised over $4.6 million, with 60 billion coins sold to more than 7000 holders. Oh, and did we mention? Analysts predict that once the presale ends and BTFD lists at $0.0006, those who got in early are looking at some insane returns. Here’s where things get spicy. BTFD has a P2E game in beta that’s already live. While players won’t earn rewards just yet, the game’s launch in Stage 10 got everyone hyped. On top of that, staking rewards are through the roof with a 90% APY. And let’s not forget the referral program. Share your link, get your friends to buy in, and watch your wallet grow. It’s like building a crew that pays you back. Then there’s the Bulls Squad—a community feature that’s adding some serious FOMO to the mix. If you’re part of it, you’re not just an investor; you’re part of an exclusive club that’s ready to take this coin to the moon. And considering BTFD’s presale soared past half its stages in just 14 days, it’s clear this coin isn’t messing around. Let’s do some quick math. By investing $25,000 in BTFD coins during Stage 13 at the price of $0.000142 per coin, you would acquire approximately 176,056,338 coins. Using the BIG50 bonus code would grant you 50% more coins, increasing your total to 264,084,507 coins. Once the presale concludes and the price rises to $0.0006 per coin, your investment without the BIG50 bonus would be valued at approximately $105,633.80. With the BIG50 bonus, your investment would grow to around $158,450.70, delivering an additional $52,816.90 in potential returns. Fartcoin: Laugh All the Way to the Bank Now, let’s talk about Fartcoin (FRTC). The name might make you chuckle, but the strategy behind it is no joke. Fartcoin is leveraging humor to build a community that’s all about having fun while making money. But don’t let the memes fool you. This coin has some serious utility baked in. First up, there’s the NFT marketplace. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on hype, FRTC is creating an ecosystem where holders can trade exclusive, hilarious NFTs. Think memes, but on steroids. It’s like turning internet culture into a tradable asset. Then there’s the rewards system. Fartcoin isn’t just for holders; it’s for active community members who engage, create, and share. The more you contribute, the more you earn. And with a presale that’s already pulled in significant funds, it’s clear that people are buying into the vision—and the humor. Analysts are cautiously optimistic. Some predict a 10x return post-presale if FRTC’s NFT marketplace gains traction. But as always with meme coins, it’s a high-risk, high-reward game. Still, if you’re looking for a coin that combines laughs with potential profits, Fartcoin might just be your jam.. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Jumping into the BTFD presale is easy and earning extra coins is an opportunity you don’t want to miss. Go to the Presale Page at https://www.btfd.io/buy-now/ . Connect Your Wallet: Choose MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or any compatible option. Enter the Bonus Code: Use BIG50 to get 50% more coins. Enter Purchase Details: Input how much BTFD you want Confirm and Buy: Finalise the transaction in your wallet, and you’re all set. Conclusion So, which coin should you bet on? Both have their strengths. BTFD Coin is all about utility and rewards, with its P2E game, staking, and referral program creating multiple ways to earn. Its presale performance and price predictions make it a no-brainer for anyone looking to cash in big. Fartcoin, on the other hand, is carving out a niche with its humor-driven approach and NFT marketplace. It’s got the potential to disrupt the meme coin space in a way we haven’t seen before. But it’s also riskier, relying heavily on community engagement and its ability to keep the jokes fresh. At the end of the day, why not both? Diversifying your portfolio is always a smart move. Just make sure you do your research and invest only what you can afford to lose. But if you’re looking to join a presale that’s already making waves, BTFD Coin is where it’s at. Don’t miss out on this wealth-generation opportunity.

38310116,https://nulltx.com/?p=137213,1735571710,"Best Meme Coin Presales to Buy This Week – Invest in BTFD Coin, Goatseus Maximus, and Non-Playable Coin Before It’s Too Late","Best Meme Coin Presales to Buy This Week: Get Ahead with BTFD Coin, Goatseus Maximus, and Non-Playable Coin for Potential Big Returns Remember 1973? The global economy crumbled under an oil embargo, creating a financial mess no one could forget. But amidst the chaos, savvy investors found opportunities buried in the rubble— “buying the dips” became their mantra, and it paid off big. Fast forward to today: meme coins like BTFD Coin, Goatseus Maximus, and Non-Playable Coin are redefining how the next-gen investor capitalises on market shifts. It’s a wild ride, and you don’t want to be left out. Over the years, meme coins have become more than just online jokes. They’ve exploded into an entirely new asset class, thanks to community-driven hype and tangible utilities. Whether it’s Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, meme coins have proven their staying power. Now, with the rise of play-to-earn (P2E) games and decentralised finance (DeFi) incentives, a new contender, BTFD Coin, is leading the charge to take meme coins to the next level. With its robust staking rewards, referral program, and massive community growth, BTFD Coin is the buzzword in the crypto world right now. So, what makes BTFD Coin worth your attention? And how does it stack up against Goatseus Maximus and Non-Playable Coin? Here’s a closer look at the best meme coin presales to buy this week. BTFD Coin: The Undisputed Meme Coin Champion BTFD Coin (short for “Buy The Dip”) is stealing the spotlight, thanks to its blistering presale success. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, BTFD Coin’s presale is now in Stage 12, with a price of $0.000064—a staggering 837.5% ROI from its initial stage. With over $4.38 million raised and 58 billion coins sold, BTFD Coin is setting the pace for meme coin presales. And here’s the kicker: analysts predict the coin could hit $0.0006 after the presale, meaning early buyers stand to gain massively. The excitement doesn’t end there. BTFD Coin offers a unique P2E game, allowing holders to earn while they play. Plus, with its referral program, staking rewards, and strong community backing, it’s more than just a meme coin—it’s a full-blown ecosystem. And let’s not forget the exclusive BIG50 bonus code. Enter BIG50 at checkout, and you’ll lock in 50% extra coins Inspired by the iconic strategies of Warren Buffett during the 1973 crash, $BTFD is here to help investors turn dips into opportunities. At just $0.00013 in Stage 12, it’s a golden chance to secure future profits. Make your investment count with the BIG50 bonus! Use code BIG50 during your purchase to get 50% extra tokens. For example, 100 tokens become 150 instantly. Don’t delay—secure $BTFD today for maximum rewards. Goatseus Maximus: The Mythical Underdog Goatseus Maximus has a name as epic as its ambitions. Inspired by ancient Greek mythology, this meme coin leans heavily into storytelling and branding. Its presale has garnered decent attention, especially among Gen Z and Millennial investors looking for a mix of fun and financial potential. The coin’s utility lies in its creative NFT marketplace, where holders can mint, trade, and collect NFTs based on mythical beasts. While this concept is intriguing, Goatseus Maximus lacks the real-world utility and financial incentives that BTFD Coin offers. Price-wise, Goatseus Maximus is hovering at $0.00003 in its presale, with projections to reach $0.0002 post-listing. While that’s a decent return, it doesn’t quite match the explosive ROI potential of BTFD Coin. Community engagement is where Goatseus Maximus shines. From weekly NFT drops to meme contests, the project has built a loyal following. But is it enough to outpace BTFD Coin? Probably not. Non-Playable Coin: The Satirical Wildcard Non-Playable Coin (NPC) is the joker in the meme coin pack. Playing on gaming culture and the NPC meme, this coin is all about satire and social commentary. Its tagline? “Because sometimes, you just want to watch the world burn.” Despite its cheeky approach, NPC has a surprisingly robust roadmap. The project plans to launch a gamified DAO where holders can vote on meme-related projects. While this idea has niche appeal, it doesn’t offer the same widespread earning opportunities as BTFD Coin’s P2E game or staking rewards. NPC’s presale price sits at $0.00002, with a post-listing projection of $0.00015. It’s a modest gain, but when compared to BTFD Coin’s potential, it feels like small potatoes. The community is quirky and fun, but without tangible utilities like staking or referral rewards, NPC struggles to compete. Why Buying the Dip Matters in 2024 Let’s circle back to 1973. The oil crisis sent the global economy into a tailspin, and markets plummeted. But while the masses panicked, a few bold investors saw opportunity in the chaos. Those who bought the dip didn’t just survive—they thrived. The same principle applies today. Meme coins like BTFD Coin are the modern-day equivalent of those hidden gems. By getting in early, you’re positioning yourself for potentially life-changing gains. How to Buy BTFD Coin Using BIG50 Want in? Here’s how to grab your share: Go to https://www.btfd.io/buy-now/ . Connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet works a charm). Enter the bonus code BIG50 and click “Apply”. Choose how much $BTFD you want to buy. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction. Don’t sleep on this. The presale has 16 stages, and coins are selling like hotcakes. Bottom Lines BTFD Coin stands out as the best meme coin presale to buy this week. Its explosive presale performance, innovative P2E game, and robust community-driven ecosystem make it a no-brainer for investors looking to capitalise on the meme coin craze. With the BIG50 bonus code, you can lock in an even better price, making this the perfect time to dive in. So, what are you waiting for? Head to presale page, enter the BIG50 code, and secure your stake in what could be 2024’s biggest crypto success story. Don’t miss your chance—buy the dip today!

Interestingly, there has been an ongoing negative trend following the latest acquisition streak related to MicroStrategy, as the firm continues to announce new purchases every Monday. BTC Dumps to Monthly Lows It was less than two weeks ago when the landscape around the primary cryptocurrency seemed highly bullish. It kept charting consecutive all-time highs, with the latest coming on December 17 at just over $108,000. Thus, the asset had gained roughly $40,000 since the US presidential elections on November 5. However, this was when the US Federal Reserve concluded its last FOMC meeting for the year, and even though the interest rates were slashed as expected, some hawkish comments by Chair Jerome Powell turned the entire market upside down . BTC started dumping hard in value and slumped to $92,000 three days later. Although it managed to bounce off in the following week and even challenge $100,000 on a couple of occasions, it ultimately failed, and the subsequent rejections drove it south hard. Bitcoin took another turn for the worse today as its price dumped by a few more grand, slumping to $91,330 (on Bitstamp), which became its lowest price tag since November 27. The altcoins have joined the negative ride, with XRP and ADA dumping by over 6%, while many meme coins have been hit even harder. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 30.12.2024. Source: TradingView MicroStrategy to Blame? Today’s price slump came just a few hours after the Nasdaq-listed business intelligence software giant announced its consecutive BTC purchase. MicroStrategy has now made such announcements for eight consecutive Mondays. Although taking BTC off the free market sounds like a bullish development, almost all Monday purchases by the Saylor-founded company have been followed by immediate corrections. On November 25, BTC stood above $99,000 but quickly slumped to under $91,000. On December 2, bitcoin had jumped to $98,000 but dropped to $93,000 after MicroStrategy’s announcement. On the following Monday, BTC was above $101,000 before it crashed to $94,000. On December 16, it stood north of $106,000 but retraced to $103,500 within the same day. Lastly, It traded at $96,200 on December 23 before another correction drove it south by three grand. Today’s price decline has resulted in a drop to a multi-week low, for now, but BTC risks dumping even further if it loses the $90,000 support level. In fact, some analysts argue that if it breaks that support, it could slump to and below $80,000.

38310074,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116147,1735571649,"Record DEX Trading Volume Reaches $320B in December: Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Raydium Lead the Surge","DEX trading volume soared to an all-time high of $320.5 billion this December, according to data from The Block, surpassing the previous monthly record of $299.6 billion set in November. This surge underscores the mounting popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi) products and services, with many investors favoring decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for their transparency, user custody of funds, and permissionless trading. Leading the pack among decentralized exchanges were Uniswap with $103 billion in trading volume, followed by PancakeSwap’s $72 billion and Raydium’s $54.6 billion. Meanwhile, centralized exchanges (CEXs) also posted impressive figures, reaching $2.78 trillion in spot trading volume, the highest since May 2021—indicating that both centralized and decentralized platforms are thriving in the current market cycle. Notably, Binance alone accounted for $950 billion of that CEX volume in December, reinforcing its position as a juggernaut among centralized platforms. In this extensive exploration, we’ll dissect the implications of DEX trading volume hitting a record high, compare decentralized and centralized exchanges, examine underlying factors fueling such trading activity, and predict how these evolving ecosystems could shape cryptocurrency markets in 2025 and beyond. Along the way, we’ll also address concerns about market fragmentation, liquidity, regulatory oversight, and user experience. 1. Understanding the December DEX Trading Volume Milestone 1.1 The Rise from $299.6B to $320.5B Just a month ago, decentralized exchange volumes were already on a notable upswing, breaching $299.6 billion in November. The December leap past $320 billion marks a rapid expansion that’s capturing the attention of both new and seasoned market participants. This near 7% increase in month-on-month activity highlights the broader trend: more traders are migrating to or experimenting with DEXs. Several factors could explain this momentum: DeFi Innovation : DeFi platforms continue to release new features—yield farming strategies, liquidity mining programs, and cross-chain bridges that facilitate easier asset transfers. These innovations often draw users looking for novel revenue-generating opportunities. Heightened Security Awareness : Users are placing greater emphasis on self-custodial solutions following numerous security breaches and insolvencies in centralized entities over the years. DEXs allow individuals to retain control of their private keys. Market Volatility : Crypto price fluctuations can spur short-term traders, scalpers, and arbitrageurs to capitalize on spreads across various protocols, boosting overall trading volumes on DEXs. 1.2 Leading Platforms: Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Raydium Uniswap ($103B) : Having launched in 2018, Uniswap remains the top decentralized exchange on Ethereum. Its automated market maker (AMM) model revolutionized how users trade tokens without relying on traditional order books. Over time, Uniswap introduced multiple versions (v2, v3) to improve efficiency and liquidity management. PancakeSwap ($72B) : Built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), PancakeSwap has experienced explosive growth thanks to lower fees and faster transaction times compared to Ethereum mainnet. Its popularity in yield farming, lotteries, and initial farm offerings (IFOs) expanded its user base quickly. Raydium ($54.6B) : Operating on the Solana blockchain, Raydium benefits from Solana’s high throughput and low costs. It also provides liquidity for Serum’s decentralized order book, helping Raydium attract both AMM-centric traders and those seeking a more traditional trading experience. These top three DEXs serve different blockchains, indicating that DEX adoption isn’t limited to Ethereum. Cross-chain platforms, sidechains, and layer-2 solutions are also contributing to the overall volume growth by offering alternatives with lower fees or faster transaction confirmation times. 2. Parallel Growth in Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) 2.1 CEX Spot Trading Volume: $2.78 Trillion Even as decentralized finance garners headlines, centralized exchanges remain dominant in raw volume terms, posting an impressive $2.78 trillion in December. This figure is the highest monthly CEX volume since May 2021, underscoring that many retail and institutional traders continue to rely on the liquidity, user experience, and broader asset offerings that centralized platforms provide. 2.2 Binance’s Dominance Binance accounted for $950 billion (roughly 34%) of the CEX volume in December—a staggering concentration that highlights the exchange’s expansive product suite, marketing reach, and deep liquidity pools. Binance’s ecosystem goes beyond spot trading, extending into futures, staking, loans, and an NFT marketplace. This wide range of services often keeps users within Binance’s ecosystem instead of migrating to other platforms. 2.3 Comparing CEX and DEX Models Although CEXs still command a larger share of the market, the DEX ecosystem’s surge to $320.5 billion is noteworthy. It suggests that both models have their own strengths: Custody of Funds : On a DEX, users maintain custody of their private keys. CEXs, on the other hand, require customers to deposit funds with the exchange— introducing counterparty risk if the exchange is hacked or insolvent. Regulatory Clarity : CEXs often hold licenses or comply with local regulations, while many DEXs navigate a gray area. However, regulators are increasingly turning their attention to decentralized protocols. User Experience (UX) : Centralized platforms typically offer smoother onboarding, advanced trading tools, and customer support. DEX interfaces can be less intuitive, though new solutions aim to close this gap. Liquidity : Historically, CEXs had an advantage in liquidity, but as DEX volumes and cross-chain solutions mature, that gap is narrowing. 3. Key Factors Driving DEX Adoption 3.1 Regulatory Pressures and User Privacy Some traders are gravitating toward DEXs in pursuit of privacy and less stringent know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Concerns over personal data leaks and the possibility of asset freezes or confiscations on CEXs have made decentralized alternatives appealing. However, this aspect may change if global regulators push stricter rules on decentralized platforms. 3.2 Self-Custody and Decentralized Governance A core philosophical pillar of cryptocurrencies is decentralization. DEXs embody this principle by allowing users to control their private keys, removing single points of failure. Moreover, many DEXs use governance tokens that empower holders to vote on protocol upgrades, fee structures, and other crucial decisions—encouraging community-driven development. 3.3 Technological Maturation and Layer-2 Scalability Rising transaction fees and network congestion on Ethereum initially slowed DEX adoption. However, the advent of layer-2 solutions (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync) and alternative layer-1 blockchains (e.g., BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche) has significantly lowered gas costs and improved throughput. This evolution makes it more feasible for retail users to trade on DEXs without incurring exorbitant fees. 3.4 Diverse DeFi Services Beyond simple token swaps, many DEXs now offer: Liquidity Farming : Users can stake tokens to earn yield or governance tokens. Lending/Borrowing Protocols : DeFi lending markets allow users to deposit assets as collateral to borrow other tokens. Derivatives Trading : Protocols like dYdX or GMX facilitate perpetual swaps and margin trading with decentralized liquidity. Such integrated services create a one-stop ecosystem for DeFi participants, driving higher trading volumes. 4. Challenges Facing Decentralized Exchanges 4.1 User Experience and Education Despite rapid improvements, some DEXs remain daunting to newcomers unfamiliar with wallets, seed phrases, or bridging assets between blockchains. Educational resources, user-friendly interfaces, and reliable customer support are paramount to attract mainstream traders. 4.2 Security Concerns While self-custody eliminates certain risks, it also places full responsibility on users to maintain their private keys and avoid scams. Smart contract vulnerabilities can lead to exploits or draining of funds. Ensuring robust security audits and adopting decentralized insurance measures can mitigate these risks. 4.3 Fragmented Liquidity The crypto market is increasingly multi-chain. Although cross-chain bridges and interoperable solutions are improving, liquidity can still be scattered across diverse platforms, complicating price discovery. Projects like ThorChain, LayerZero, and multi-chain DEX aggregators aim to unify liquidity, but fragmentation remains an ongoing challenge. 4.4 Regulatory Uncertainty Lawmakers around the world are scrutinizing DeFi. Concerns about illicit financing, tax evasion, and consumer protection prompt calls for new regulations. However, enforcing these on protocols with no centralized entity remains complex. The outcome of these policy debates could either spur institutional acceptance or impose new hurdles on decentralized platforms. 5. Growth Trajectory for CEXs: Still Irreplaceable? 5.1 Institutional Adoption Centralized exchanges often serve as gateways for institutional capital. Regulatory compliance, custodial solutions, and business-friendly interfaces make them more appealing to hedge funds, asset managers, and publicly traded companies dipping their toes into crypto. As a result, large-scale investments typically enter the market via CEXs before trickling into DEXs. 5.2 Launchpads and Token Offerings IEOs (Initial Exchange Offerings) remain a preferred fundraising method for some crypto startups, primarily because CEXs handle the marketing, compliance checks, and user verification processes. Exchanges like Binance Launchpad or KuCoin Spotlight have successfully introduced new projects to millions of users. 5.3 Reputation and Brand Recognition Large exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken have established brand recognition that breeds consumer trust. Institutional investors and even retail participants often opt for well-known centralized platforms, especially if they’re uneasy about the complexity or perceived risks of decentralized trading. 5.4 The Likelihood of Coexistence Given the advantages of both models, it’s plausible that CEXs and DEXs will coexist, each targeting distinct user demographics. Some analysts expect the future to be “hybrid,” blending aspects of decentralization (e.g., user custody, trustless transactions) with centralized compliance and user experience enhancements. CEXs might incorporate decentralized order matching or integrate with layer-2 networks, while DEXs could adopt compliance tools to keep regulators satisfied. 6. Detailed Look at Leading DEX Platforms 6.1 Uniswap: Pioneer on Ethereum V3 Concentrated Liquidity : Uniswap’s latest version allows liquidity providers to concentrate their capital within specified price ranges, dramatically increasing capital efficiency. Governance Token (UNI) : UNI token holders shape protocol decisions, from fee structures to development roadmaps. Ecosystem Growth : Numerous applications integrate Uniswap for token swaps, making it a backbone of the broader Ethereum DeFi environment. 6.2 PancakeSwap: BNB Chain Powerhouse Lower Transaction Costs : Operating on the BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain), PancakeSwap caters to users deterred by Ethereum’s high gas fees. Gamified Farming : Its user-friendly interface and features such as “Syrup Pools,” lotteries, and NFTs enhance the platform’s appeal to mainstream and novice crypto users. CAKE Governance : The CAKE token grants holders voting rights on proposals, marketing fund usage, and new product rollouts. 6.3 Raydium: Fast Transactions on Solana Solana Ecosystem : Raydium benefits from Solana’s high throughput (up to tens of thousands of transactions per second) and meager transaction fees. AMM + Order Book : By connecting with Serum’s central limit order book, Raydium uniquely merges automated liquidity provision with more traditional order book trading. RAY Token : The platform’s native token, RAY, is used for governance, staking rewards, and yield farming opportunities. 7. Emerging Trends: Cross-Chain DEXs and Aggregators 7.1 Cross-Chain Interoperability As DeFi matures, users often hold assets across multiple blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon). Cross-chain DEXs and bridging solutions aim to unify this liquidity, enabling seamless swaps without the need to hop through multiple platforms. Protocols like ThorChain and LI.FI are pioneering ways to facilitate cross-chain trades in a single transaction. 7.2 DEX Aggregators To address liquidity fragmentation and deliver the best possible prices (lowest slippage, minimal fees), DEX aggregators like 1inch, Matcha, or Paraswap route trades across various AMMs and liquidity sources. By splitting orders across multiple DEXs, these platforms optimize the overall execution for end users. 7.3 Hybrid Models Projects like Injective Protocol, Osmosis, and Polkadot-based parachains are experimenting with hybrid AMM/order book designs, front-running protection, and novel liquidity-incentivization mechanisms. Over time, these advanced architectures may further boost DEX volumes by delivering a more CEX-like experience without sacrificing decentralization. 8. Regulatory Developments and Their Impact 8.1 Growing Scrutiny on DeFi Regulators worldwide—from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the European Commission—are increasingly examining DeFi. Areas of concern include: KYC/AML Compliance : Authorities worry about the anonymity some DEXs afford, potentially facilitating money laundering or terrorist financing. Tax Obligations : Automated yield farming and frequent token swaps can complicate tax reporting, prompting calls for clearer guidelines. Consumer Protection : With no central authority, users can fall victim to scams or rug pulls. Regulators may require accountability measures like audits and disclosures for DeFi protocols. 8.2 Possible Regulatory Pathways Regulated DEXs : Projects may voluntarily integrate KYC or create “permissioned pools” that only whitelisted wallets can access—catering to institutions or regulated entities. Securities Classification : Some tokens traded on DEXs could be classified as securities, subjecting the exchanges to stricter oversight and licensing. Self-Regulation : The crypto industry might introduce best-practice frameworks or standards to appease regulators without sacrificing decentralization entirely. 8.3 Impact on DEX Volume In the short term, more rigorous regulation could slow DEX activity, particularly among privacy-centric users. However, transparent guidelines may also encourage institutional adoption, propelling volumes higher in the long run. A balanced approach could streamline mainstream acceptance while preserving DeFi’s core values. 9. Market Outlook: Could DEX Trading Volume Keep Climbing? 9.1 Adoption Beyond Crypto-Natives Future growth depends on expanding beyond crypto-savvy traders into mainstream finance. As blockchain technology becomes more user-friendly and applications like “DeFi 2.0” simplify yield opportunities, DEX usage could swell dramatically. Partnerships with traditional financial institutions might also open the doors for bigger capital inflows. 9.2 DeFi Mergers and Acquisitions We may see established financial players invest in or acquire DeFi projects. Such involvement could broaden the user base but also create debates about how “decentralized” these platforms remain under corporate stewardship. Nonetheless, it may be a catalyst for bridging the gap between legacy finance and DeFi. 9.3 Macroeconomic Climate The macro environment—interest rates, inflation, and global economic conditions—can significantly affect crypto markets. If monetary policies remain loose or uncertainty grips traditional markets, some investors may allocate more capital to crypto, further boosting DEX volumes. Conversely, a flight to safety in risk-averse conditions might dampen volumes. 9.4 Competition and Innovation Competition among DEXs spurs innovation. Enhanced user interfaces, advanced order types, lower fees, and cross-chain operability could persuade more users to adopt DEXs. However, if security issues or front-running problems persist, certain traders may remain loyal to centralized platforms. 10. Conclusion December’s DEX trading volume record of $320.5 billion reflects the continued maturation and adoption of decentralized finance—a phenomenon that seemed niche just a few years ago. Platforms like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Raydium exemplify the breadth of opportunities available across multiple blockchains, while centralized giants such as Binance continue to dominate overall market share with an impressive $950 billion in trading activity this month alone. Looking forward, the parallel growth of CEXs and DEXs suggests a crypto ecosystem diverse enough to accommodate a wide range of preferences and use cases. Regulatory challenges, technological refinement, and user-experience improvements are likely to shape how both models evolve. DEXs could capture even more users if they can offer competitive liquidity, intuitive designs, and robust security—without alienating regulators. Simultaneously, CEXs must balance innovation with compliance demands, appealing to both retail traders and institutions seeking deeper liquidity and integrated financial services. Whether DEX volumes continue breaking records or CEXs retain their lion’s share, one thing is clear: the crypto market has grown remarkably sophisticated, with users having more choices than ever before. DEXs represent a transformative force, championing decentralization and user sovereignty, while CEXs deliver the convenience and scale that many still rely on. In this dual landscape, each month’s volume figures serve as a barometer, revealing shifting preferences, technological advancements, and the ongoing quest for a more inclusive, resilient financial system.

Potential Catalysts for Q1 2025 5.1 Market Recovery and Institutional Inflows As global financial markets gradually adjust to changing interest rate policies and inflation concerns, institutional investors may search for alternative assets. Cryptocurrencies, especially those with tangible utility or thriving ecosystems, stand poised to capture new capital flows. If Q1 2025 sees a return to risk-on sentiment, the entire crypto space—particularly mid-cap tokens on the Grayscale Top 20 Tokens list—could witness renewed demand and liquidity. 5.2 Technological Upgrades and Partnerships Technological breakthroughs often act as strong catalysts for token appreciation. Whether it’s a major Ethereum update bolstering layer-2 adoption or a cross-chain partnership that expands user accessibility, these milestones can bring significant attention to the tokens involved. For instance, if Ethena or Jito finalize noteworthy collaborations with established DeFi protocols, their valuations and user adoption might soar. 5.3 Regulatory Developments Regulations remain a double-edged sword. Clear guidelines can boost institutional adoption, but overreaching policies could hamper market growth. Nonetheless, some tokens on the list—like Grass and Jupiter—stand to benefit from regulations that favor privacy-preserving, ESG-compliant projects. Watch for legislative updates in major markets such as the U.S., the European Union, and Asia that could define the contours of crypto’s next growth phase. 6. Potential Risks and Challenges 6.1 Macroeconomic Uncertainty Geopolitical tensions, recession fears, and fluctuations in global capital flows can trigger risk aversion. Despite crypto’s rising popularity, it still remains sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Any significant downturn might stall the momentum of even the most promising tokens in Grayscale’s watchlist. 6.2 Competitive Pressures With thousands of crypto projects vying for market share, fierce competition can undermine a token’s growth prospects. A new Layer-2 solution more advanced than Ethena, or a rival aggregator with a smoother interface than Jito, could siphon away users and liquidity. 6.3 Regulatory Pitfalls While regulatory clarity is beneficial, sudden clampdowns—like restrictive stablecoin regulations or outright bans on certain DeFi activities—could impact specific projects adversely. For instance, Hyperliquid’s cross-chain yield vaults might need to navigate complex compliance protocols if regulators demand licensing or extensive disclosures. 6.4 Technological Limitations Despite robust roadmaps, not all projects can deliver on ambitious technical promises. Delays, security hacks, or untested code can derail a token’s trajectory. DeFi vulnerabilities, in particular, are well-documented, putting user funds at risk if smart contracts are not thoroughly audited and stress-tested. 7. Strategies for Investors Watching the Grayscale Top 20 Tokens 7.1 Diversification One of the primary reasons many look to the Grayscale Top 20 Tokens list is to diversify beyond the “blue-chip” coins. Splitting capital among different types of projects—e.g., Layer-1s, DeFi, metaverse, privacy—can reduce overall risk and capture multiple growth narratives. Investors should also weigh allocations in stablecoins or other defensive assets to hedge against volatility. 7.2 Staggered Entry and Dollar-Cost Averaging Given crypto’s price swings, some traders prefer a staggered approach—gradually buying tokens over weeks or months rather than all at once. Dollar-cost averaging can smooth out extreme highs and lows, making it easier to hold positions through dips, especially if the fundamentals remain strong. 7.3 Monitoring On-Chain Activity and Community For many emerging tokens, vibrant developer communities and robust on-chain metrics (e.g., transaction volumes, unique wallet growth, staking participation) are better indicators of health than speculative price spikes. Tools like DeFiLlama, Dune Analytics, and Messari can help track real-time metrics. Engaging with social channels—Telegram, Discord, Twitter (X), or Reddit—offers insight into a project’s community sentiment and imminent developments. 7.4 Staying Informed on Regulatory Shifts Investors should stay up to date on regulations in key jurisdictions. Even if a token boasts compelling technology, it can falter under regulatory crackdown. On the flip side, favorable legislation—like new frameworks for token offerings or improved taxation rules—can spur sudden bullish momentum. 8. Conclusion The Grayscale Top 20 Tokens list for Q1 2025 reflects an ever-evolving crypto landscape where innovation remains the driving force. With fresh entrants like Hyperliquid (HYPE), Ethena (ENA), Virtual Protocol (VIRTUAL), Jupiter (JUP), Jito (JTO), and Grass (GRASS), Grayscale showcases its confidence in decentralized liquidity solutions, Layer-2 scalability, metaverse expansion, privacy-focused protocols, DeFi aggregation, and ESG-oriented blockchain initiatives. Beyond these promising newcomers, established projects in the list—ranging from large-cap Layer-1 blockchains to DeFi heavyweights—ensure the watchlist remains a balanced mix of reliability and forward-thinking concepts. While risks such as macroeconomic headwinds, regulatory hurdles, and intense competition persist, strategic diversification and diligent research can help investors navigate the terrain more confidently. In the weeks and months ahead, technological developments, partnerships, and shifting market sentiment will play critical roles in whether these tokens fulfill their potential. Yet, for many observers and investors alike, the latest Grayscale Top 20 Tokens underscores a resounding theme: as blockchain matures, innovative ideas continue to disrupt traditional models, forging opportunities that range from incremental improvements to radical reimaginations of finance, communication, and sustainability.

38310012,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116155,1735571533,"El Salvador’s Bitcoin Holdings Exceed 6K BTC, Yielding $157M in Profits","El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings have once again captured worldwide attention as the Central American nation now boasts over 6,000 BTC on its balance sheet. According to data from Watcher Guru, the country’s average purchase price stands at $45,465 per Bitcoin, translating into roughly $157 million in unrealized profits. This milestone underscores President Nayib Bukele’s unwavering commitment to cryptocurrency adoption, despite past skepticism from critics who question the volatility and long-term sustainability of such an investment strategy. In this comprehensive article, we delve into El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey—exploring the background of its national Bitcoin policy, the factors that spurred its rapid accumulation, and the economic and geopolitical implications of a country holding thousands of BTC. We also examine the broader impact on crypto adoption, investor sentiment, tourism, and potential regulatory ripple effects. Finally, we will discuss the challenges and controversies surrounding El Salvador’s approach and consider how this precedent might shape the relationship between nations and cryptocurrencies in the years to come. 1. A Brief History of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Adoption 1.1 The Bitcoin Law El Salvador made history on June 8, 2021, when its legislature passed the “Bitcoin Law,” making it the first country in the world to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. President Nayib Bukele championed this law as a solution to economic challenges such as underbanking and heavy reliance on remittances. Under the new legislation, local businesses are mandated to accept Bitcoin as payment, alongside the U.S. dollar, for goods and services. This decision was heralded by crypto enthusiasts as a groundbreaking step toward global adoption. Skeptics, however, warned of risks from Bitcoin’s price volatility and the country’s existing debt situation. Nonetheless, Bukele’s government pressed forward, rolling out a digital wallet called “Chivo” to facilitate Bitcoin transactions among citizens and businesses. 1.2 Early Bitcoin Purchases Almost immediately after the Bitcoin Law took effect on September 7, 2021, El Salvador began purchasing BTC from the open market. President Bukele frequently announced these buys on social media, highlighting each dip as a “discount” opportunity. Over time, these acquisitions steadily grew, often timed with market corrections. As the average purchase price indicates, the government aimed to buy low and hold for the long term, hoping to leverage Bitcoin’s upside potential. 1.3 Controversies and Global Reactions From the outset, international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and rating agencies expressed concern. Critics pointed to potential money laundering risks, unstable price fluctuations, and the uncertainty surrounding how Bitcoin’s legal-tender status would play out in day-to-day commerce. Despite the pushback, El Salvador’s leadership maintained that their strategy was forward-looking, akin to adopting the internet in its early days. The government insisted that the Bitcoin Law would ultimately attract foreign investment, spur tourism, and empower citizens left out of traditional banking services. 2. Breaking Down El Salvador’s Bitcoin Holdings 2.1 Accumulation to Over 6,000 BTC Fast forward to December 2024: El Salvador now holds over 6,000 BTC, each purchased at an average price of $45,465. Based on current market valuations, that equates to roughly $157 million in unrealized gains—an impressive figure for a relatively small nation grappling with numerous economic challenges. While critics argue that profits remain “unrealized” (and could vanish if Bitcoin’s price plunges), supporters see validation in these paper gains. They suggest that El Salvador’s strategic approach—buying during price dips and holding in a manner akin to a corporate treasury—has paid off at least in the short term. 2.2 Funding the Bitcoin Treasury One lingering question is how El Salvador finances these purchases. Official information indicates the government taps various sources, including tax revenues, bond issuances, and targeted allocations from state budgets. President Bukele has occasionally teased the idea of issuing “Volcano Bonds,” referencing the country’s geothermal energy production, to fund more Bitcoin buys or related infrastructure. 2.3 Custody and Transparency Custody arrangements for El Salvador’s BTC remain somewhat opaque. The government has not fully disclosed which exchanges or wallets are used to store such a sizable cryptocurrency holding. Transparency advocates argue that clear disclosures on wallet addresses and custodial practices would help mitigate concerns about mismanagement or potential hacking incidents. Others note that too much transparency might create security vulnerabilities for these state-held digital assets. 3. Economic and Geopolitical Implications 3.1 Betting on an Emerging Asset Class By amassing over 6,000 BTC, El Salvador is effectively betting on Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value and global medium of exchange. Should Bitcoin’s price continue to rise over time, the country could reap substantial profits, potentially using them to bolster public spending or offset debt obligations. Conversely, if Bitcoin’s price crashes, El Salvador’s balance sheet might face immediate pressure, stoking social and political tensions. 3.2 International Relations El Salvador’s decision to elevate Bitcoin to legal-tender status has somewhat strained its relations with certain global financial institutions. The IMF, for instance, has voiced concerns that widespread usage of Bitcoin might complicate the country’s ability to repay external debt. Rating agencies have also flagged the volatility risk associated with this strategy. Still, El Salvador’s stance may prompt other developing nations to explore crypto as a means of diversifying national reserves or boosting economic growth. 3.3 Potential Model for Other Countries Paraguay, Panama, and other Latin American nations have flirted with the idea of adopting cryptocurrency-friendly policies. While no other country has declared Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador’s experience is closely watched. If El Salvador’s economy benefits—and if the national government successfully monetizes some of its crypto holdings—other regions might follow suit, especially if they share similar concerns about reliance on foreign currencies or high remittance costs. 4. Impact on Crypto Adoption and Financial Inclusion 4.1 The Chivo Wallet and On-the-Ground Adoption Key to El Salvador’s strategy is the Chivo wallet, a government-backed mobile application enabling quick BTC and USD transactions with minimal fees. The government even provided a $30 incentive in Bitcoin to encourage adoption. While official data on daily usage has varied, anecdotal reports indicate a modest level of day-to-day usage among some merchants and citizens, particularly for smaller transactions and remittances from abroad. Critics, however, point out that a significant portion of Salvadorans remain uncertain or uneasy about Bitcoin. They either cash out the $30 bonus immediately or refrain from using the wallet altogether. Technical glitches and user experience issues also hamper adoption, suggesting that more user education and platform refinement are necessary. 4.2 Remittances: A Game-Changer? One of the primary arguments for El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy was the potential to reduce hefty remittance fees. Salvadorans living abroad often pay as much as 7-10% in fees to send money home via traditional services. By using Bitcoin and the Chivo wallet, they can theoretically bypass those high fees, streamlining the process while saving millions annually. Early reports suggest some people are leveraging Bitcoin for remittances, but the usage is not as widespread as initial forecasts predicted. Over time, as comfort with the technology grows, cross-border transactions may become a more compelling argument in favor of the policy. 4.3 Boosting Tourism Beyond remittances, El Salvador is using the Bitcoin angle as a marketing tool for tourism. From surf-friendly beaches like El Tunco to events highlighting Bitcoin entrepreneurs and digital nomads, the government hopes that “crypto tourism” will spur local business, especially in hospitality and retail. Indeed, some anecdotal accounts mention foreign visitors traveling to experience a “Bitcoin country.” While it’s not yet a massive revenue stream, local businesses in tourist hotspots report incremental benefits from crypto-savvy travelers. 5. Broader Crypto Market Context 5.1 Bitcoin’s Volatile 2021-2024 Journey Bitcoin’s price rollercoaster is central to understanding El Salvador’s gains and risks: 2021 Surge : When El Salvador initially adopted BTC, prices were still recovering from the pandemic-induced collapse of 2020. BTC soared above $60,000 in late 2021, providing early validation for the pro-Bitcoin stance. 2022 Correction : A sharp downturn in 2022 led many skeptics to proclaim El Salvador’s strategy a failure, as BTC dipped below $20,000 at points. 2023-2024 Resurgence : Bitcoin’s subsequent recovery, pushing above $50,000 and beyond, breathed new life into the country’s holdings, culminating in the current $157 million in unrealized profits. This cyclical pattern underscores both the potential upside and the gut-wrenching volatility that a national treasury must stomach when holding cryptocurrencies. 5.2 Institutional Embrace Major companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have also adopted Bitcoin as part of their balance sheets. Such institutional moves help validate El Salvador’s approach, showing that large entities can view BTC as a strategic reserve asset. Nonetheless, no corporation’s stake compares to a sovereign nation making a legal-tender declaration, which arguably carries far greater macroeconomic consequences. 5.3 DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 Solutions While El Salvador’s focus is primarily on Bitcoin, the broader crypto market has diversified into DeFi protocols, NFTs, and various altcoins. If El Salvador’s success persists, it might expand into other digital assets—or inspire new policies around stablecoins and tokenized financial instruments. However, Bitcoin’s brand recognition and first-mover advantage remains a powerful differentiator, so likely it will remain El Salvador’s primary crypto of choice in the near term. 6. Criticisms and Concerns 6.1 Financial Risk One of the harshest critiques is the potential risk to El Salvador’s solvency. If Bitcoin were to plummet, the country might face severe deficits or be forced to liquidate BTC at a loss. Though the $157 million profit figure looks impressive now, critics highlight that it’s purely notional—a realized profit only materializes upon sale, an action that could undercut the very premise of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. 6.2 Lack of Transparency Some local and international watchdogs question the government’s level of transparency around these purchases. They also raise concerns about using public funds to buy and hold a volatile asset without legislative oversight or public consultation. The Chivo wallet’s code and data are not fully open to external audits, creating skepticism about system reliability and long-term viability. 6.3 Possible Social Backlash Not all citizens embrace Bitcoin. Protests erupted during the initial rollout, with some citing confusion over the technology and distrust in the government’s motives. Critics argue that money spent buying Bitcoin could instead be directed toward social welfare, healthcare, or education, particularly in a country where poverty rates remain relatively high. 6.4 Regulatory Pressures from Abroad Should global regulators intensify oversight of crypto transactions—particularly those tied to national treasuries—El Salvador may find itself at odds with major financial powers. The U.S. government, for instance, could impose restrictions if it perceives that El Salvador’s Bitcoin usage undermines anti-money laundering (AML) protocols or international financial norms. 7. Future Outlook: Could El Salvador Sell? 7.1 Strategies for Realizing Profit With $157 million in unrealized gains, many wonder if El Salvador might strategically sell a portion of its Bitcoin holdings to finance infrastructure projects or pay down debt. Thus far, President Bukele has avoided any large-scale liquidation, leaning instead on a “HODL” (hold on for dear life) mentality. However, in periods of extreme price spikes, partial profit-taking might alleviate concerns about debt burdens. 7.2 Scaling Bitcoin Adoption Domestically The Salvadoran government’s next frontier is ensuring that more businesses and citizens utilize BTC in daily life. The success of the Bitcoin Law hinges not just on the treasury’s performance but also on average people and small businesses. Future updates to the Chivo wallet, incentives for merchant adoption, and educational campaigns may help drive broader acceptance. 7.3 Potential Partnerships and Tech Advancements With the money flowing from Bitcoin’s appreciation, El Salvador could form strategic partnerships with crypto companies, integrating advanced payment solutions or exploring other blockchain applications. Partnerships with major crypto exchanges, DeFi protocols, or stablecoin issuers might further embed El Salvador in the global crypto market. 7.4 Volcano Bonds and Geothermal Mining The teased “Volcano Bonds” could raise capital for additional Bitcoin purchases or infrastructure projects, leveraging the nation’s volcanic energy for BTC mining. If successful, these bonds might become a blueprint for other nations exploring resource-based token issuances. However, investor appetite for such instruments remains uncertain, especially amid shifting regulatory and macroeconomic landscapes. 8. Lessons for Other Nations and the Global Crypto Community 8.1 Sovereign-Level Adoption: A New Chapter El Salvador’s example demonstrates that crypto adoption is no longer confined to individuals, startups, or corporations—it has reached the national stage. While the project is still in its infancy and carries risks, it opens the door for other governments to see Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as more than just speculative assets. Sovereign-level adoption may accelerate if El Salvador reaps tangible benefits, such as improved remittance flows or tourism revenue. 8.2 Importance of Infrastructure and Education One of the key takeaways is the vital need for robust infrastructure and clear educational initiatives. Even if a country endorses Bitcoin, it won’t gain traction without user-friendly wallets, reliable merchant solutions, widespread internet access, and thorough public understanding of digital assets. 8.3 Regulatory Balance El Salvador’s journey also underscores the delicate balance regulators face: they can stifle innovation by imposing overly strict rules, or they can invite unsustainable speculation by adopting an anything-goes approach. The future likely lies in moderate, carefully designed frameworks that protect consumers while encouraging innovation. 8.4 Market Cycles and Long-Term Vision No project is immune to the booms and busts inherent in crypto cycles. Whether El Salvador’s Bitcoin gambit is lauded as a visionary move or panned as a misstep will hinge largely on Bitcoin’s long-term performance and the government’s ability to navigate price volatility. Patience, risk management, and a willingness to adapt are essential to any entity—nation or enterprise—embracing crypto at scale. Conclusion El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings, now exceeding 6,000 BTC and yielding approximately $157 million in unrealized profits, stand at the intersection of innovation, ambition, and controversy. The Central American nation has become a global case study, showcasing both the compelling opportunities and significant challenges of embracing Bitcoin as legal tender. Supporters hail the prospect of robust gains, remittance savings, and an inclusive digital economy. Skeptics warn of volatility, a lack of governmental transparency, and potential risks to El Salvador’s fiscal health. As we move into 2025, the success or failure of El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy will likely hinge on Bitcoin’s market cycles, the government’s policy finesse, and the rate at which ordinary Salvadorans integrate BTC into their daily lives. Whatever the outcome, El Salvador’s experiment has undeniably propelled the crypto narrative to new heights, forcing international regulators, investors, and economists to reconsider how nations might leverage or be impacted by decentralized digital assets. Ultimately, El Salvador’s story is still unfolding. While $157 million in unrealized profits is impressive on paper, true success will depend on the tangible benefits realized by citizens and the broader economy. Should the bullish scenario materialize and drive further gains—both financially and technologically—El Salvador may stand as a pioneer for countries seeking to harness the transformative power of Bitcoin. If not, its experience will serve as a cautionary tale of overestimating the short-term upsides of a highly volatile asset. In either case, the world is watching closely, and the lessons learned will doubtlessly shape the future of national crypto adoption worldwide.

38309973,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=116157,1735571471,Five Key Bitcoin Trends for 2024 to Watch as the Year Ends,"Bitcoin trends for 2024 are on every crypto investor’s mind as the year draws to a close. Despite periods of market volatility, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to attract interest from institutional investors and retail traders alike. Recent analyses by Cointelegraph highlight five pressing factors shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory: a possible rebound to $92,000, concerns over U.S. stagflation, the inflection point for short-term holder profitability, steady institutional interest amid quieter retail engagement, and Binance’s near-record stablecoin holdings. Together, these trends paint a detailed picture of where Bitcoin might be headed as we enter the new year. In the following sections, we’ll dissect each trend’s relevance, evaluate the underlying data, and consider how they align with broader macroeconomic signals. Whether you’re a seasoned investor seeking deeper market insights or a newcomer wondering about BTC’s future, understanding these five dynamics could be vital to your decision-making process as 2024 transitions into 2025. 1. Possible Rebound at $92,000 1.1 The Basis for the $92,000 Projection One of the most buzzworthy developments at the end of 2024 is the forecast that Bitcoin could rebound toward $92,000. Though price predictions often come with disclaimers—no one can foretell market movements with absolute certainty—analysts point to various on-chain and macroeconomic factors supporting the possibility of significant upside. On-Chain Metrics : Data from Glassnode, CryptoQuant, and other analytics platforms reveal healthy network usage, increasing hash rates, and a steady decline in BTC held on exchanges. Historically, lower exchange reserves can indicate a strong “hodl” mentality among long-term investors, potentially priming BTC for rapid upside moves if buying pressure intensifies. Technical Indicators : Chart-based analyses by market technicians often reference crucial support and resistance levels. Since BTC has consolidated above certain key moving averages through much of Q4 2024, some traders believe an eventual breakout could push the cryptocurrency above $90,000. 1.2 Why This Matters for Investors For those aiming to capitalize on upside potential, a forecast of $92,000 could significantly influence near-term trading decisions and portfolio rebalancing. A few considerations include: Risk Management : If you’re a long-term holder, you may simply ride the volatility. However, short-term traders might set stop losses or take-profit targets aligned with these price milestones. Market Sentiment : Bullish forecasts tend to fuel positive market sentiment, generating excitement that can become self-reinforcing. However, if BTC fails to reach these targets, sentiment can rapidly flip. 1.3 Potential Caveats No forecast is guaranteed. Skeptics note that BTC’s historical volatility can quickly invalidate bullish theses—sometimes overnight. Moreover, external macro events such as Federal Reserve monetary policy changes or black swan events could stall or reverse any anticipated price surges. Thus, while $92,000 is on the radar, caution and thorough risk assessment remain prudent. 2. U.S. Stagflation Fears 2.1 Understanding Stagflation Stagflation refers to a period where economic growth stagnates while inflation remains persistently high. It’s particularly concerning because traditional remedies to combat inflation, like raising interest rates, can exacerbate unemployment and stifle growth. On the flip side, measures to spur growth, such as lower interest rates or quantitative easing, risk further fueling inflation. In the context of Bitcoin trends for 2024 , the prospect of U.S. stagflation could have a complex influence on BTC’s value proposition: Inflation Hedge Argument : Some view Bitcoin as “digital gold,” a finite-supply asset that can serve as a hedge against inflation. If mainstream concern over stagflation escalates, more investors could pivot to Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Reduced Risk Appetite : Conversely, stagflation can lead to higher unemployment and diminished consumer spending. Under such conditions, risk assets—including Bitcoin—sometimes face selling pressure if investors move to traditionally safer harbors like government bonds or cash. 2.2 How Stagflation Might Affect BTC The actual impact of stagflation on Bitcoin hinges on investors’ risk appetite and perception of BTC’s role in a portfolio. If a growing cohort believes in Bitcoin’s hedging capabilities, the stagflation narrative might bolster inflows into crypto. Meanwhile, institutions wary of heightened volatility could shy away, especially if broader market liquidity tightens due to restrictive monetary policies. 2.3 Historical Precedent Although Bitcoin is relatively young (launched in 2009), certain parallels can be drawn from gold’s performance during previous stagflationary periods in the 1970s and early 1980s. Gold’s real price rose as investors sought refuge from currency debasement and economic uncertainty. Bitcoin’s correlation to gold is inconsistent, but the psychological narrative around digital scarcity could attract a similar cohort of buyers during extended periods of inflationary pressure. 3. Short-Term Holder Profitability at a Crucial Inflection Point 3.1 Defining Short-Term Holder Profitability Short-term holder (STH) profitability typically tracks BTC owners who have held coins for less than 155 days. Because these holders often engage in more frequent trading or have less conviction in holding BTC through downturns, their collective behavior can signal upcoming volatility or trend shifts in the market. STH Profit vs. Loss : When a significant portion of short-term holders remain in profit, bullish momentum is more likely to sustain. Conversely, if a large segment of STHs are underwater, selling pressure could intensify when prices bounce, limiting sustained recoveries. 3.2 Why This Inflection Matters Now Currently, analytics from on-chain providers show that short-term holder profitability is hovering at a make-or-break level. If BTC price remains above certain cost-basis thresholds—often identified around $80,000–$82,000—STHs could be more inclined to hold rather than sell. A jump in profitability boosts trader confidence, creating fertile ground for bullish follow-through. FOMO vs. Capitulation : If short-term holders see their portfolios in profit and believe higher prices are imminent, they may hold out for bigger gains, intensifying FOMO (fear of missing out). Conversely, even a modest pullback could trigger capitulation if they fear losing their newly acquired profits. Volatility Amplification : STHs’ emotional swings tend to magnify volatility, making the next few weeks potentially turbulent for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. 3.3 Potential Outcomes Bullish Scenario : STH profitability stays in positive territory, fueling additional buying as momentum traders jump in. A price climb beyond $90,000 could ensue. Bearish Scenario : Profit-taking sets in if the market faces any shock—from macro data to negative news. Once short-term holders start selling en masse, momentum could quickly shift downward. 4. Institutional Interest vs. Quiet Retail Engagement 4.1 Institutional Players Remain Steady Even as 2024 wraps up, data suggests that institutional participation in Bitcoin remains relatively robust. Over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks report consistent inflows, and leading asset managers maintain or increase their BTC positions. High-profile names—like MicroStrategy—continue to add Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries, reinforcing the notion that large entities still view BTC as a strategic asset. ETF Momentum : The anticipation and eventual launch of multiple spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier in the year have further legitimized BTC among traditional finance circles. This ETF wave has reduced barriers to entry, enabling a broader swath of institutional funds to participate without the complexities of direct crypto custody. 4.2 Retail Investors Taking a Holiday Break Meanwhile, the retail segment appears more subdued. The holiday season often sees lower trading volumes as everyday investors focus on festivities rather than market speculation. Additionally, some retailers might be concerned about potential tax implications, waiting until the new year to make moves or rebalance portfolios. Impact on Liquidity : With fewer retail traders active, short-term volatility might hinge disproportionately on institutional maneuvers or whale transactions. Potential Post-Holiday Surge : January historically brings fresh capital inflows and rebalancing. As the new year dawns, retail traders could return in full force, potentially reigniting short-term price swings. 4.3 Implications Going into 2025 If institutional investment continues unabated and retail re-engages after the holiday lull, Bitcoin could witness robust price support and liquidity expansion in early 2025. However, should the macro picture deteriorate or negative headlines surface, a lack of “dip buying” from retail might leave the market vulnerable to more pronounced corrections. 5. Binance Exchange’s Stablecoin Holdings Near All-Time Highs 5.1 Understanding the Role of Stablecoins Stablecoins, such as USDT (Tether), USDC (USD Coin), and BUSD (Binance USD), serve as critical liquidity tools in the crypto ecosystem. They enable seamless transitions between fiat-pegged digital assets and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin without the need for traditional banking rails. When stablecoin balances on exchanges increase, it often suggests a heightened capacity for immediate crypto purchases—akin to “dry powder” waiting on the sidelines. 5.2 Binance’s Position Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, has reportedly accumulated stablecoin balances near record levels. Potential reasons include: User Deposits : Traders may be selling altcoins or BTC into stablecoins, preferring to sit in a neutral position while awaiting clearer market direction. Institutional Parking : Large-scale entities could deposit stablecoins on Binance in anticipation of a market-moving event—like an upcoming regulatory decision or a major Bitcoin price breakout. Yield-Seeking : Certain stablecoins can be staked or lent out via Binance Earn programs, offering participants modest yet relatively stable returns. 5.3 Interpreting All-Time-High Stablecoin Holdings Near-record stablecoin holdings can be interpreted in multiple ways: Bullish Potential : If market sentiment turns bullish, these stablecoins could rapidly convert into BTC, fueling a sharp rally. Cautionary Sign : Conversely, large stablecoin reserves might indicate a preference for safe harbor among traders wary of short-term volatility, which could suppress Bitcoin’s upward momentum if confidence remains low. Ultimately, the stablecoin dynamic underscores the ongoing tension between bullish optimism and prudent risk management within the crypto trading community. Broader Market Context Macroeconomic Factors Beyond the five focus points, several macro factors could shape Bitcoin trends for 2024 as we head into the new year: Interest Rate Policies : Central banks worldwide may adjust monetary strategies in response to inflation readings. Higher rates can dampen appetite for risk assets, whereas lower rates can provide liquidity tailwinds for BTC. Geopolitical Tensions : Unstable geopolitical climates—ranging from trade wars to outright conflicts—sometimes spur flight-to-safety behavior. While historically associated with gold, Bitcoin’s role as a crisis hedge is increasingly debated. Regulatory Shifts : The crypto industry awaits ongoing legal rulings, potential new frameworks for stablecoin issuance, and further clarity on how DeFi protocols might be regulated. Any regulatory shakeup could quickly alter BTC’s risk profile in institutional portfolios. Potential Tech-Driven Catalysts On the technological front, Bitcoin developers and community members continue to propose improvements to scalability, privacy, and overall network performance. Though the Bitcoin blockchain evolves slowly compared to some altcoins, any meaningful protocol upgrade could capture market attention—especially if it helps BTC better integrate with emerging sidechains or fosters innovative new use cases. Conclusion As 2024 draws to a close, the crypto sphere is abuzz with discussions around Bitcoin trends for 2024 —from lofty price targets like $92,000 to stagflation fears that might intensify Bitcoin’s inflation-hedge narrative. Short-term holders find themselves at a pivotal profitability juncture, while institutions maintain steady inflows, and retail traders remain temporarily sidetracked by holiday festivities. Meanwhile, Binance’s record stablecoin holdings imply that substantial liquidity stands ready to deploy at a moment’s notice. For investors and traders alike, these five developments carry significant weight. Bitcoin’s performance does not operate in a vacuum; it’s influenced by global macro factors, investor psychology, and shifting liquidity dynamics. A robust institutional foundation and rising stablecoin reserves could foreshadow renewed bullishness if confidence surges in Q1 2025. Yet caution is warranted—stagflation, geopolitical unpredictability, or unexpected regulatory announcements could quickly disrupt positive momentum. The closing weeks of 2024 underscore a broader lesson: Bitcoin’s market fortunes hinge on the interplay of multiple forces, each capable of amplifying or tempering price movements. Staying informed about the latest on-chain data, macroeconomic signals, and exchange metrics can provide a competitive edge, whether you’re looking to buy the dip or hedge against potential downside risk. Ultimately, as the dust of 2024 settles, it may well be the synergy among these five key trends—price rebound forecasts, macro headwinds, STH profitability, institutional vs. retail flows, and stablecoin stockpiles—that set the stage for Bitcoin’s journey into 2025.

38311937,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106970,1735571366,Creditor Champion Debunks Claims of FTX $16B January Repayment,"A notable FTX creditor has rebuffed plans that the defunct crypto exchange FTX would resume customer repayment as early as January 2025. For context, the news made the rounds since the weekend that the Sam Bankman-Fried-owned crypto exchange will repay its creditors starting from January 3. The speculation also suggested that FTX would distribute $16 billion to its customers within 60 days of the repayment start date.FTX Creditor RespondsIn a tweet today, Sunil, a self-acclaimed FTX creditor champion, refuted the claims. He noted that the January payments were false and provided the actual distribution details.Sunil stated that FTX has recovered $13 billion from debtors, which could increase to $14 billion in March. Meanwhile, the creditor noted that the bankruptcy estate of the defunct exchange does not intend to distribute the entire amount.He stated that FTX filed to reserve 50% of the recovered funds. As a result, it can only distribute half of the disputed claims, worth $7 billion, in the initial repayment phase.Meanwhile, Sunil noted that FTX would fully recompense its customers in two to three years.Community Seeks ClarityNotably, the FTX bankruptcy estate announced earlier this month that it would resume repaying creditors on January 3. The press release also stated that it would reimburse affected customers up to $16 billion from that date.Amidst the inconsistencies, users have sought clarification on the actual repayment date. For instance, a user pointed to an earlier X post from the FTX page confirming the distribution will resume in January and asked what Sunil made of it.Meanwhile, the FTX bankruptcy proceeding has had its fair share of controversy. Earlier, customers fumed at the cash repayment ruling by the presiding judge, John Dorsey, which allowed the exchange to pay the monetary value of a user’s balance when it filed for bankruptcy.The ruling meant that creditors missed out on the crypto market's upsurge. For instance, Bitcoin and Solana traded at $16,871 and $16.25, respectively, when FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/30/creditor-champion-debunks-claims-of-ftx-16b-january-repayment/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=creditor-champion-debunks-claims-of-ftx-16b-january-repayment,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Sunil Kavuri, a representative of the largest FTX creditor cluster, clarified that the court-approved reorganization plan will become effective on Jan. 3. Creditor distribution will begin within 60 days of that date, but repayments will not necessarily be complete in that time. Kavuri also stressed that FTX has $13 billion in cash, not $16 billion.

Currently in its presale phase at $0.0041 and with over $5.7 million raised, Lightchain AI is quickly capturing investor interest with its innovative combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain. Meanwhile, Toncoin (TON) and Solana (SOL) continue to compete for gains, but their momentum may be overshadowed by Lightchain AI’s potential to disrupt the market. Toncoin faces challenges amidst a competitive market Toncoin (TON) has just seen a small rise in price, going up by 3.6% to $6.39 after hitting a low of $5.53 on December 10th. Even with this bump, the crypto still deals with big issues There h͏as been a drop in DEX work, with fewer swaps and money pools on places like Stone.FI and DeDust. This fall in net use brings up worries about the way Toncoin can get better. Also, the capture of Telegram head Pavel Durov in France has brought more doubt which adds to higher selling stress and a gloomy view for TON. These things show the tough and changeable side of the money market, pointing out the problems Toncoin must face to reach steady growth. Solana’s network is growing but faces some bumps along the way Solana's network has been on the rise, with daily transactions hitting close to 67 million—a clear sign of growing adoption and user engagement. This growth highlights Solana's scalability and efficiency, making it an attractive option for both developers and users. That said, the cryptocurrency hasn’t been without its challenges, including a recent 7% dip after the Federal Reserve’s policy announcements. Even with these ups and downs, Solana has managed to hold onto critical support levels, showing resilience in a turbulent market. Experts are optimistic that if Solana stays above key thresholds, it could be set for a strong rebound, especially as the broader market finds its footing. Still, rapid growth paired with market volatility means Solana faces an interesting road ahead—but one with plenty of potential! Lightchain AI emerges as a high-growth alternative Lightchain AI is setting itself apart by integrating artificial intelligence directly into blockchain technology, allowing industries such as healthcare, finance, and logistics to adopt AI-driven decentralized applications. Its ability to tackle real-world challenges with privacy-preserving AI computations and scalability gives it a distinct edge over competitors like Toncoin and Solana. Lightchain AI’s presale success , with over $5.7 million raised, underscores investor confidence in its potential to reshape the blockchain landscape. With a roadmap that includes enterprise partnerships, global adoption, and innovative developer tools, Lightchain AI is poised to achieve exponential growth, making its $0.0041 price point a rare opportunity for early investors. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

38309788,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746923-grayscale-ethereum-mini-trust-could-outperform-s-and-p-500-2025?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1735570990,Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust: Could Outperform The S&P 500 In 2025,"Summary The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust is poised to outperform the S&P 500 in 2025, driven by positive expectations for the Ethereum and Bitcoin markets. Ethereum's Pectra upgrade is likely to act as a strong positive catalyst in 2025 to improve the platform and increase the price. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust should attract investors since it has the lowest fee among the Ethereum ETFs. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ( ETH ) has a good chance to significantly outperform the S&P 500 ( SPY ) in 2025. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust is designed to reflect the value of the cryptocurrency, Ether, which is the native digital coin on the Ethereum Platform. I expect Ethereum to perform well as it follows the positive expectations of the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) bull market in 2025. Crypto experts expect Bitcoin to perform well in 2025 with price projections between $150,000 and $200,000. Ethereum is estimated to be priced at about $7,925 by December 2025 according a group of analysts . Overall, I think that many investors will be attracted to the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust because it has the lowest fees as compared to the other Ethereum ETFs. ETH is waiving its fee for the first 6 months since the ETF began trading on July 23, 2024 or until the total assets under management reach $2 billion. The fee will be 0.15% after either criteria is met. So, the fee will be implemented around January 23, 2025 at the latest. The Ethereum ETF with the next lowest fee is the Franklin Ethereum Trust ( EZET ) with a fee of 0.19%. Ethereum's Background Ethereum was built to enable others to write smart contracts and decentralized applications. The benefit of smart contracts are for fast and secure transactions. Smart contracts can save money by eliminating the need for middlemen such as lawyers or brokers. The smart contracts are basically scripts that automate actions between two parties. Ethereum provides a blockchain for others to write these smart contracts. Anyone can create their own rules and build smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. One example of a smart contract is between a supplier and a retailer where shipments and payments could be set-up. The code of the contract could be written to say if a delivery was made on time from the supplier, then automatically pay the full amount for the goods. If the delivery was made one day late, then the smart contract could automatically pay only 99% of the full amount for the goods. One percent could be deducted for each day that the delivery is late as a part of the contract. There are many applications where smart contracts can be useful. Another area is real estate where smart contracts can be set up for property transactions. For example, a smart contract could be set up so that a sale of a property is executed when certain conditions are met such as payment confirmation. Automated rental agreements and payments could also be set-up. Property titles could be transferred securely on the blockchain. Escrow services could be implemented to hold and transfer funds when necessary. Smart contracts can also be used in healthcare to secure patient data and to automate the management of trial protocols. They can be used in elections by speeding up the tallying and reporting of votes. They can be used for legal contracts. They can be used in insurance to streamline policy management/the claims process and to automate underwriting and fraud protection. Smart contracts can be used in gaming for engagement and to give rewards. These are just some examples among many for smart contracts. Demand Drivers for Ethereum Institutional investment is a large demand driver for Ethereum. Although, Ethereum's ETFs were launched in July this year, the price of Ether and the ETFs underperformed Bitcoin and its related ETFs. However, this may change in 2025. Bitcoin is thought of as digital gold, so it is probable that Ethereum as the next largest crypto is thought of as digital silver. Bitcoin moved further into acceptance as an alternative investment due to its first mover advantage, long-term performance, and with the issuance of its ETFs. So, I think that investors will also be warming up to Ethereum to further diversify their crypto portfolios. The existence of ETFs like the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust make investing in crypto easier to do and understand since they can be traded like stocks in standard brokerage accounts. The ETF's are likely to bring more awareness to Ethereum so that investors are likely to seek more knowledge about it as an alternative investment. Ethereum's Growing Open Interest (theblock.co) The chart above shows Ethereum's increasing open interest. Ethereum's open interest shows the number of open positions. Since the open interest has been increasing, this shows that money is flowing into Ethereum. November and December show a significant increase in the open interest. This looks bullish as the price of Ethereum increased from the low $2,000s to above $3,000 in November and December. This could be the start of a longer-term trend of higher demand for Ethereum. The Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Pectra is the name of Ethereum's next big upgrade which has an expected implementation in Q1 2025. The Pectra update is a series of proposals designed to enhance the network's functionality, scalability, and user experience. I won't explain the details of the technical changes , but I'll give you the gist of the expected benefits of the upgrade. Supply validator deposits will take only 13 to 19 minutes as compared to the current time of 12 hours. This time is a waiting period after deposits are fully processed. Withdrawals and exits are also streamlined and more convenient as part of the upgrade. Another improvement is to have a balance of validators and participants in the protocol. This will allow stakers to stake in more flexible increments. Decreasing disk requirements by changing how data is stored can help to increase the gas limit. This can lead to lower transaction fees, decreased network congestion, and quicker transaction processing times. Other changes are expected to make Ethereum more decentralized and censorship-resistant. The improvements as part of the Pectra upgrade can make Ethereum more attractive for developers and users. This might increase demand for Ethereum among investors. The Potential For Pro-Crypto Policies President elect, Donald Trump stated that he wants to make the United States the crypto capital of the world . This might involve providing incentives to invest in cryptocurrencies. It may also involve creating incentives for crypto miners to operate in the United States. Another idea from Senator Cynthia Lummis is to create a U.S. national strategic Bitcoin reserve . If a Bitcoin reserve is created and approved, it could drive Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies significantly higher. When Bitcoin moves higher, it tends to drive other cryptos such as Ethereum higher. Ethereum's Technical Perspective Ethereum (ETH-USD) Price Chart with RSI and MACD (TradingView) Ethereum's monthly price chart above has been similar to Bitcoin's in the past two cycles. However, Ethereum has been lagging Bitcoin in the current cycle. Bitcoin exceeded its previous all-time high from 2021, while Ethereum didn't yet rise to its all-time high from 2021. The peak of each cycle tends to occur approximately when the RSI (purple line in the middle of the chart) increases above 90. The last cycle had a double top in price. So, the peak in 2021 actually occurred at the second top when a bearish divergence formed. This is marked by the price rising from the 2021 1st top to the 2nd top, while the RSI decreased during the same time. This formation typically results in a long-term sell-off, which did occur in 2022. While Bitcoin did exceed its previous all-time high, the price has pulled back below $100,000. Bitcoin's RSI also tends to increase above 90 near the peak of each cycle on its monthly chart. However, Bitcoin's RSI only hit about 77 and is currently at about 73 after the recent pullback. So, if the price follows previous cycles, we could see the price rise further in 2025 as the RSI increases to above 90. This would likely drive Ethereum higher as it typically follows Bitcoin during the last year of the cycle. The Risks For Ethereum There is no guarantee that Ethereum's price will follow similar patterns to previous cycles. Ethereum could continue to lag Bitcoin's performance. There is also no guarantee that Bitcoin rises to the price targets in 2025 that many are providing. The range for Bitcoin's 2025 price target is between $150,000 to $400,000 . If Bitcoin fails to rally in 2025, it would likely lead to a failure of Ethereum to rally. Another risk for Ethereum is competition. Some primary competitors for Ethereum include: Cardano ( ADA-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), Polygon ( MATIC-USD ), and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ). These competitors are also designed to enable smart contracts. Cardano is considered to be more energy efficient than Ethereum. Solana and Polygon are faster with lower fees than Ethereum. Avalanche can scale more effectively than Ethereum. The plus side for Ethereum is that it remains the top smart-contract platform because of its large developer community and user base. Therefore, Ethereum will likely have to improve through upgrades to be faster, less expensive, and with a better ability to scale. Otherwise, the competition could outperform Ethereum, which could lead to a lagging price for Ether and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust. Long-Term Outlook for the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust Ethereum has the potential to outperform the S&P 500 in 2025. If Ethereum hits its analysts' projected price of $7,925 in 2025, it would be a 136% gain over the current price of $3,352. The S&P 500 is expected to rise by 10% according to a collection of analysts . If such a significant rise in Ethereum does occur in 2025, it is likely to drive the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust significantly higher. Ethereum's Pectra Upgrade should make Ethereum more competitive from a developer and user perspective. This could act as a positive catalyst to drive the price of Ethereum higher in 2025 to the expected target price. Bitcoin's expected increased adoption as digital gold in 2025 can also act as a positive driver of Ethereum's price.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746923-grayscale-ethereum-mini-trust-could-outperform-s-and-p-500-2025?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/38309788.jpeg
38312691,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323428,1735570926,Bitcoin on the Brink of a Major Rebound – These Key Levels Could Decide Its Fate,"Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is currently trading at $92,294, down 1.75% in the last 24 hours, with a substantial trading volume of $42.2 billion. Despite its dominance in the cryptocurrency market, bearish momentum prevails, with critical levels in play that could decide its near-term trajectory. Analysts suggest Bitcoin might be gearing up for a potential recovery, though significant hurdles remain. Key Indicators Signal a Potential Rebound Market indicators hint at a possible price reversal for Bitcoin. Analyst Martinez recently noted a bullish divergence forming against Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a classic signal of weakening bearish momentum. The RSI currently stands at 32, indicating oversold conditions but lacking immediate signs of a reversal. #Bitcoin $BTC below $93,000 is a problem because, as you can see, there isn't enough significant support below it! pic.twitter.com/MSJxAT56OG — Ali (@ali_charts) December 30, 2024 Additionally, Bitcoin’s price is consolidating around the $92,150 level, forming a triple-bottom pattern—a potential setup for a rebound if buyers regain control. Adding to the bullish narrative, long positions on Binance have risen significantly, from 53.12% to 64.04%. This increase indicates growing optimism among traders that Bitcoin may soon see upward momentum. A key resistance level to watch is $94,000, with targets of $95,705 and $98,330 in the short term if bullish sentiment gains traction. The TD Sequential indicator presented a buy signal on the #Bitcoin $BTC hourly chart, anticipating a price rebound if, only if, the $93,000 support holds. pic.twitter.com/bQZIt5rzAO — Ali (@ali_charts) December 29, 2024 Liquidations Add Market Volatility A major factor influencing Bitcoin’s outlook is the $14 million worth of potential liquidations clustered around $95,300. Market makers often target these levels, increasing liquidity and creating price volatility. Breaking above this zone could pave the way for a substantial rally, but failure to do so could maintain downward pressure. Bearish Risks Loom Below $93,400 Despite these bullish signals, Bitcoin remains vulnerable. The descending triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart suggests continued resistance near $94,000, while the 50 EMA at $94,140 reinforces this barrier. Any drop below $93,400 could invalidate the bullish setup, potentially dragging Bitcoin to $84,000 or even $70,000—a significant 25% decline from current levels. Technical Levels to Watch Immediate Resistance: $94,000, with stronger levels at $95,705 and $98,330. Support Levels: $92,150 (triple bottom), followed by $90,404 and $88,761. Momentum Indicators: RSI at 32.49 signals oversold conditions, while the descending triangle pattern maintains selling pressure. Bitcoin Technical Outlook Bitcoin’s near-term movement hinges on its ability to breach the $94,000 resistance and sustain above key support levels. A breakout could trigger a rally toward $98,330, while a breakdown below $93,400 may lead to significant losses.

42416384,d0ff82e0-8a76-48ce-98e1-848358e0ddbb,1735570863,"AI Agents Capture Attention as AiXBT, ai16z, and Virtuals Surge","The dead internet theory may not be in full swing just yet, but AI agents have already taken over much of Crypto Twitter.    Reply bots on X are populating posts on nearly everything, using artificial intelligence models to increase reach and blockchains to settle micro transactions or record data.    These bots are increasingly interacting with other bots, with pairs of such bots launching their own tokens. (While token issuance still requires humans, often the concept stems from whatever the AI bots decide).      Initial replies to nearly all of CoinDesk’s posts in the past few weeks are often these AI bots, each either providing a reaction, a summary or analysis of linked reports, or sometimes even subtle snarks.    The relatively new “AI Agents” sector has become crypto’s hottest in the past few months, beating gains in bitcoin, memecoins and decentralized finance tokens.    Leading the pack among agents is ai16z, a meme parody of venture fund a16z that operates as a decentralized hedge fund. Token holders become “partners” by supplying their holdings to an on-chain fund, gaining a cut of profits until the fund’s expiration date in October 2025. The fund had locked up more than $22 million in user tokens as of Monday Dec 30.    Those trading decisions are a mix of the bot’s read of the market. Token holders meeting a certain threshold can also interact with the bot directly, pitching ideas, and trying to influence its investing decisions.      Developers behind the Solana-based AI16Z are considering launching a blockchain dedicated to AI applications. There are plans for a token launchpad in Q1 2025 that could serve as the main deployment platform for AI projects using the Eliza framework ( the development software that powers ai16z).    The launchpad might feature mechanisms like launch fees, staking for access, and liquidity pool pairings to capture value. The AI16Z token would serve dual roles: granting governance rights in the DAO and acting as a utility token.    Virtuals Protocol is the largest AI Agent creation tool by market capitalization. It allows anyone to create and program their own AI agent and float a token attached to it in the open market.    The top Virtuals-based agent, G.A.M.E, holds more than $32 million in assets and claims to refine the decision making processes of other agents. AIXBT is the largest Virtuals-based agent by market capitalization, with its token worth nearly $500 million as of Monday.    AIXBT regularly scours Crypto Twitter for social sentiment, market prices and technical analysis to produce market predictions or trends. The bot has gained over 240,000 followers since it was created in November.    https://x.com/aixbt_agent/status/1873687707777642699  What Market Traders Say  As a CoinDesk analysis previously noted, the AI Agents trend emerged in October with the viral X account Terminal of Truths (@truth_terminal). Created to spout philosophical musings and tidbits of internet culture, the AI learned to talk by examining Infinite Backrooms, an unfiltered chat log between two other AI bots.    These bots are trained on vast datasets of text, including books, articles, websites and other sources. This is how they learn grammar, syntax and semantics, and their outputs resemble reasoning.    As they learn from human-generated text, they can perpetuate biases found in that content. For the new wave of AI bots on social media, that means the output (such as promoting a token) simply reflects whatever data users contribute to its training set. So, if people want an AI bot to shill memecoins or talk about a specific, for instance, they can nudge it that way.    Many market watchers see these agents as the next step in crypto markets.    “AI agents and social trading are revolutionizing markets by blending data-driven insights with community strategies, creating a smarter, more inclusive trading ecosystem,” Neal Wen, Head of Global BD at Kronos Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “AI empowers traders with real-time data analysis and automated strategies, enhancing decision-making and risk management.”    “Together, these innovations empower both experienced and novice traders to drive efficiency, liquidity, and market stability. This marks a key step in the evolution of crypto trading, making it more accessible and dynamic for all,” Wen added.    “AI agents have been taking the spotlight from memecoins as successful projects like AI16z, Zerebro, and Virtuals enable users to create their own agents, launch tokens on pump.fun, and automate posts on Twitter,” ​Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said in a Telegram message. “We're seeing new use cases develop weekly as AI agents expand their integrations with more platforms to create autonomous hedge funds, live streams, and more”    “The sudden surge of interest and money is reminiscent of DeFi Summer,” Ruck added, referring to the DeFi application and token boom in 2020-21.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/30/ai-agents-capture-attention-as-ai-xbt-ai16z-and-virtuals-surge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fba1690e7f8b6ade817857b534dccaf64dbe3847-4800x2700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, Lightchain AI (LCAI) , an emerging contender currently priced at $0.0041 during its presale, is gaining notable attention. With its cutting-edge technology and practical applications, Lightchain AI appears well-positioned to outpace the price growth of both Solana and Shiba Inu by 2025, presenting investors with a promising opportunity for substantial returns. Solana’s Growth Hinges on Scalability, but Lightchain AI Offers More Versatility Solana has made a name for itself as a top player in blockchain growth known for it͏s fast deal speeds and low costs. Its focus on decentralized apps (dApps) and unique tokens (NFTs) keeps drawing both builders and users. But, the Solana world isn’t free from issues, like some network breaks and tough rivalry from other Layer-1 blockchains. Lightchain AI, on the other hand, brings together blockchain and smart tech to give fresh answers that go past usual DeFi and NFT uses. Its platform backs new decentralized smart apps in areas like shipping, health care, and money. By focusing on real-world use and providing solutions that can grow and change, Lightchain AI sets itself apart from Solana's mostly blockchain-focused way. Shiba Inu’s Community Strength Lacks the Utility of Lightchain AI Shiba Inu has become a prominent example of community-driven growth, leveraging its meme status and dynamic ecosystem to establish itself among the leading cryptocurrencies. While SHIB’s primary strength lies in its loyal community and initiatives such as Shibarium, its utility remains largely confined to its identity as a meme coin. In contrast, Lightchain AI takes a more strategic approach by incorporating advanced AI integration to empower businesses with decentralized applications tailored to specific industry needs. From predictive analytics to supply chain optimization, Lightchain AI delivers practical, real-world value that extends well beyond the speculative nature often associated with meme coins like SHIB. Lightchain AI’s Potential to Lead 2025 Price Predictions Lightchain AI’s presale success, with over $5.7 million raised, signals growing confidence in its roadmap and vision. The platform’s commitment to innovation and real-world impact makes it a strong candidate to top 2025 price growth charts. By targeting industries that demand advanced computational solutions, Lightchain AI bridges a critical gap in the market. Its ability to cater to both developers and enterprises ensures rapid adoption, positioning it as a leader in blockchain innovation. Compared to Solana’s scalability focus and Shiba Inu’s community-driven model, Lightchain AI offers a more comprehensive value proposition, setting the stage for unparalleled growth in the coming years. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Shiba Inu could rise 85% if it mirrors Dogecoin’s recent price performance. While Dogecoin shows resilience, Shiba Inu struggles to gain upward momentum. Shiba Inu (SHIB) might be on the brink of an 85% price surge, provided Dogecoin (DOGE) maintains its upward market trajectory. Together, SHIB and DOGE dominate 62% of the meme coin market cap , with DOGE leading the charge as one of the top ten largest cryptocurrencies by valuation, surpassing assets like Cardano and Tron. Analysts point to Dogecoin’s strong market position as a catalyst for Shiba Inu’s potential growth. If Dogecoin sustains positive market sentiment, Shiba Inu could mirror this performance, igniting investor optimism for a bullish breakout in the near future. Crypto analyst Ali Charts predicts that if SHIB follows Dogecoin’s recent performance, its price could reach $0.000049, an 85% increase from its current level. Technical Analysis of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Dogecoin’s technical chart shows a price surge that has broken through key Fibonacci retracement levels.

Cardano (ADA) Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts and decentralized applications. It uses ADA as its native cryptocurrency, enabling users to store value, make payments, and participate in network staking. Cardano distinguishes itself with an environmentally sustainable approach, utilizing the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism for energy efficiency. The platform is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts, enhancing its scalability and efficiency. The potential of Cardano lies in its flexible infrastructure, which supports decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. With the introduction of native tokens in March 2021, it offers secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. Its design aims to process up to a million transactions per second, highlighting its scalability ambitions. In the current market cycle, the focus on sustainability and scalability may influence the attractiveness of Cardano to users and developers interested in energy-efficient and high-performance blockchain solutions. SUI (SUI) Sui is a layer-1 blockchain platform designed for global adoption. It offers a secure and scalable development environment. At its core, Sui uses an object-centric data model and the Move programming language. These features address inefficiencies found in existing blockchain architectures. Sui focuses on user experience by removing barriers in blockchain interactions. Innovations like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks make applications accessible and user-friendly. The technology has potential for widespread adoption due to its emphasis on security, scalability, and ease of use. In the current market cycle, the coin may be considered attractive because of its strong technical foundations and commitment to improving user experience. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains that discard blocks created at the same time, GHOSTDAG allows them to exist together and orders them in consensus. This creates a network structure called a blockDAG, which enables secure operation with very high block rates. Kaspa currently has one block per second and aims to reach 10 or even 100 blocks per second in the future. Kaspa offers features like Reachability for exploring the network’s structure, block data pruning to save space, and SPV proofs. Future plans include block header pruning and subnetwork support to make it easier to build layer 2 solutions. In the current market cycle, Kaspa introduces innovative technology that may be of interest due to its focus on speed and scalability in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera Hashgraph is a decentralized network that uses hashgraph technology for its ledger. Unlike traditional blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it aims for improved efficiency and performance. The absence of mining in its protocol offers environmental benefits and leads to lower transaction costs. HBAR is the native cryptocurrency of Hedera. It is used to pay for transaction fees and to secure the network through a Proof of Stake mechanism. This technology provides a fast and secure alternative for transactions and smart contracts, targeting applications in finance and other sectors. Despite its innovative design, Hedera Hashgraph faces challenges in gaining traction within a competitive blockchain environment. Its patented technology may limit broader community engagement compared to open-source projects. However, the backing of significant industry players supports its development and adoption. In the current market cycle, the attractiveness of HBAR depends on factors like market dynamics and user adoption. The platform’s unique features may contribute to its role in evolving digital transactions and applications. Conclusion ADA, SUI, KAS, and HBAR have strong potential this bull run. But XYZVerse (XYZ) , uniting sports fans and meme culture, offers unique growth prospects, making it a smarter bet.

In contrast, Dogecoin (DOGE) has faced a significant dip, shedding over 10% amid shifting market dynamics. Lightchain AI’s innovative ecosystem, combined with its robust tokenomics and strong presale momentum, has positioned it as a resilient asset in an otherwise volatile market. With investor confidence growing, Lightchain AI continues to set itself apart as a reliable choice for 2024. Lightchain AI's Resilience- A Green Start to the Year Lightchain AI (LCAI) has shown great strength, keeping a good path even while the larger crypto market is shaky. Its clever mix of smart tech and blockchain has drawn lots of investor attention, with the presale getting more than $5.6 million which shows high need from crypto fans. Experts think big rise for LCAI, with some expecting a 3,500% jump to $1 by end of 2024. This is due to its special Proof of Intelligence way and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine. This goo͏d push stands out from the drop seen in many digital coins, showing Lightchain AI's place as a hopeful choice for buyers looking for new and strong items in the changing crypto scene. DOGE's Double Digit Drop- Market Sentiment Shifts Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a significant decline, with its price dropping over 10% in the first week of the new year. This downturn is attributed to a hack affecting over 69% of the nodes on the Dogecoin network, undermining bullish momentum and dampening speculation of a potential rise to $1. Despite this setback, DOGE is attempting to recover, aiming to surpass the $0.42 resistance level. Technical indicators, such as the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) remaining above the 200-day SMA, suggest a continued bullish trend. However, investor caution persists, as evidenced by a 5.72% drop in trading volume and bearish price sentiment. Analysts predict another significant price drop for Dogecoin before the end of January 2025, indicating that market sentiment is shifting. Investors are advised to monitor developments closely, as the cryptocurrency market remains volatile and susceptible to rapid changes. What This Means for Holders and the Crypto Market The recent market movements of Lightchain AI (LCAI) and Dogecoin (DOGE) highlight a shift in investor sentiment within the cryptocurrency landscape. Lightchain AI's positive performance, driven by its integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, has attracted significant investor interest. In contrast, Dogecoin's recent price decline underscores the volatility associated with meme-based cryptocurrencies. For holders, these developments suggest a growing preference for tokens with tangible utility and innovative features. Lightchain AI's unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) offer practical applications across various industries, enhancing its appeal to investors seeking long-term value. In the broader crypto market, this trend may indicate a maturation towards valuing technological advancement and real-world applicability over speculative investments. Investors are advised to conduct thorough research and consider the underlying utility of tokens when making investment decisions, as the market continues to evolve towards projects that offer sustainable and innovative solutions. Make the right choice and invest your money in Lightchain AI , one of the few assets that have remained resilient and continue to reward holders amidst market volatility. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

38309548,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376668,1735570512,Pi Network (PI) News Recap: Here’s What Happened in 2024,"TL;DR Pi Network extended the KYC deadline to January 31, 2025, with 14 million users verified (out of the requested 15 million target). Despite the delays and confusion regarding the launch of open mainnet, the project’s app surpassed 100 million downloads. Pi Network has built a particularly solid community base in Asia , with South Korea, China, Vietnam, Singapore, India, Japan, and more turning into strongholds. Pi Network’s Developments This Year The Pi Network community witnessed multiple updates in 2024 as the team seemingly prepares to launch its open mainnet. In September, the controversial cryptocurrency project (which claims to allow people to mine digital assets from their smartphones) celebrated 2,000 days since launch, but its native token and fully-operation blockchain have yet to go live. And while the developers behind Pi Network keep promising that such significant developments are on the horizon, some community members have started losing patience due to the constant delays. Earlier this year, the team claimed that the first huge milestone was the launch of the open network. They said it will become possible once 15 million users pass necessary Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verifications and migrate to the mainnet (known as the Grace Period). In August, Pi Network announced that over 13 million people had completed authentications, while 6 million had successfully migrated. Earlier this month, the team said KYC verifications had reached 14 million. Initially, users had until the end of September to abide by the rules. However, the deadline was extended numerous times and eventually pushed to January 31, 2025. Unsurprisingly, the latest delay annoyed many members of the community, whereas others maintained that they had experienced serious issues when trying to pass KYC procedures. It is worth mentioning that Pi Network offered help to those struggling with similar problems, advising them to join a dedicated Telegram chat “where there will be mods to answer your questions.” The team also cautioned that completing verifications is only one part of the whole process. Users must also set up and confirm the wallet, sign the token confirmation agreement, and conduct other checklist steps. “These steps can be completed before KYC , no need to wait. Please complete the migration within the grace period , otherwise your Pi may be considered abandoned and unusable,” the team alerted. Meanwhile, Pi Network users have been waiting for December, when the Pi Core Team was supposed to shed more light on the mainnet open roadmap (which should allow the buying and selling of Pi tokens). However, it seems like there is little chance for the community to witness such an important disclosure before New Year’s Eve. Pi Network’s Popularity on the Rise Despite the lack of clear information about the launch of the native token and open mainnet, the frustration coming from the community, and the delays, Pi Network keeps increasing its popularity globally. As CryptoPotato reported several weeks ago, the project’s application surpassed the major milestone of 100 million downloads. Pi Network is particularly popular in Asia, where it has created multi-million communities in countries like China, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, India, Japan, and more. Not long ago, Wu Blockchain revealed that the number of local Pi Network users in South Korea reached 1.34 million, which exceeds the domestic client base of well-known crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. In fact, the only two domestic cryptocurrency-related entities with more users are Upbit (4.36 million) and Bithumb (2.24 million). Users Should Stay Vigilant The project’s huge popularity could be one reason scammers often attack the community. As such, Pi Network’s team issued two warnings to protect its community. First, they urged users to rely only on information shared on official channels. The developers also provided a dedicated safety page showing all the sources and URL links the community can refer to. Second, the team cautioned people to use only their Pi Wallets in the designated Pi Browser. “Ensure you’re in the correct Pi Wallet, not any fake one, to safeguard your Pi. The authentic Pi Wallet is also visually identified by a purple color in the navigation bar of the Pi Browser with a Pi logo featuring the Core Team apps logo,” the warning reads.

With a presale price of $0.0041 and over $5.7 million raised, Lightchain AI is on a trajectory to achieve $1, driven by its innovative approach to blockchain and artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Toncoin (TON) and Polkadot (DOT) are experiencing sliding prices as they struggle to maintain their competitive edge against rising stars like Lightchain AI. Toncoin’s challenges in attracting sustained growth Toncoin's new rise has been striking, but it's running into some problems that might hurt its lasting strength. While wallet spots have shot over 100 million, lively user take part and deal amounts have gone down. This shows that even if more users are making wallets, less are taking part in the system, which could change the token’s worth͏ as time goes on. Also, the catch of Telegram head Pavel Durov has brought some doubt, causing more selling stress and a clear fall in Toncoin's worth. Work on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) has too dropped, hinting at less network use and putting doubts about how lasting the new price jumps could be. All these parts show a chance for Toncoin to work on raising user interest and tackling these outside problems to grow more and have a better, lasting future. Polkadot’s Interoperability Efforts Face Increasing Competition Polkadot's mission to achieve blockchain interoperability is facing growing competition from platforms such as Cosmos, Avalanche, and Ethereum 2.0, all of which are advancing efforts to improve cross-chain communication and scalability. Cosmos leverages a hub-and-zone model to enable seamless interactions among blockchains, while Avalanche focuses on delivering high-performance solutions to enhance transaction speed and efficiency. This increasingly competitive environment underscores the need for Polkadot to continually innovate and distinguish its offerings to sustain its position as a leader in the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem. Lightchain AI’s presale momentum showcases its future potential Lightchain AI is rewriting the rules of blockchain by integrating artificial intelligence into its infrastructure. Unlike Toncoin and Polkadot, which cater to specific niches, Lightchain AI’s applications span multiple industries, including finance, healthcare, and logistics. The platform’s ability to deploy decentralized AI models securely and efficiently has positioned it as a leader in innovation. Lightchain AI’s presale success, raising over $5.7 million, reflects its appeal to investors looking for high-growth opportunities. Its roadmap, which includes global adoption and developer-centric tools, further cements its potential to become a major player in the crypto market. Plus, with its presale price set at $0.0041, Lightchain AI investors are poised to see significant returns as the project reaches its $1 goal. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

What’s surprising now is Biden’s allies are throwing their weight behind parts of the billionaire’s cost-cutting agenda. Elon’s crusade, part of Donald Trump’s government overhaul, has brought in unlikely alliances, heated debates, and a flurry of activity in Washington. Senator Bernie Sanders, known for his war on defense contractors, shocked his own party by backing Elon’s focus on slashing Pentagon waste. “The Pentagon, with its $886 billion budget, just failed its seventh audit. Billions are unaccounted for,” Sanders said, calling the system corrupt. Representative Ro Khanna, a Silicon Valley Democrat, declared , “Defense contractors have been fleecing the American people for far too long.” Biden allies embrace the D.O.G.E revolution D.O.G.E, co-led with fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, has gained real traction among Democrats. Florida Representative Jared Moskowitz became the first Democrat to join the D.O.G.E caucus, a group dedicated to Elon’s government efficiency goals. Ohio Democrat Greg Landsman joined soon after, saying, “You wanna be in the room where it happens.” The inaugural D.O.G.E caucus meeting in December saw an unexpected mix of attendees, including Democrats Steven Horsford of Nevada and Val Hoyle of Oregon. Horsford made his stance clear: “You can’t have a seat at the table if you’re not in the room.” Hoyle, meanwhile, dismissed any notion that efficiency is a partisan issue. “If you think there aren’t ways to make government more efficient, you’re not living in the real world,” she said. The support doesn’t mean Elon has free rein. Khanna has drawn clear lines in the sand, vowing to oppose cuts to programs like Medicare, veterans’ benefits, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Hoyle echoed similar sentiments, supporting moves to lower drug prices but opposing cuts to essential services like Social Security, the postal service, and the FAA. Elon’s Pentagon plans draw fire However, Elon’s critics think that his vision is too extreme to succeed without harming critical services. Public policy professor Don Moynihan spelled out the math: “You can’t cut $2 trillion without hitting popular programs like Social Security and veterans’ benefits. They make up two-thirds of the budget.” Moynihan warned that achieving Elon’s ambitious goals would require “draconian cuts” across the board, from defense to social safety nets. Despite this, Elon’s plan to tackle defense spending has drawn specific praise. His focus on the Pentagon—historically a black hole for taxpayer dollars—aligns with long-standing Democratic concerns about military waste. Sanders pointed to the failure of only 13 senators to oppose what he called “a defense budget full of fraud.” But while Elon and his Democratic allies seem united on defense cuts, the broader plan for a $2 trillion reduction raises significant doubts. Elon comes after the Federal Reserve Elon is also very unhappy with the Federal Reserve . He blasted the institution as “absurdly overstaffed,” citing its 24,000 employees across 12 regional banks. His comments came after the Fed announced its hawkish rate cut, leaving markets rattled and drawing Trump’s ire. “We’re trimming the fat,” the president has said, standing firmly behind Elon’s cost-cutting agenda. “No one gets to sit around collecting a paycheck for doing nothing — not even Jerome Powell.” Florida’s Moskowitz criticized the Department of Homeland Security, calling it “too big.” Elon’s proposal to shut down certain agencies and fire thousands of civil servants has drawn sharp reactions from the left. Yet, figures like Fetterman have praised his efforts, with the Pennsylvania senator calling Elon’s economic contributions undeniable. Even as the debate rages, Elon’s influence in Washington continues to grow. The fact remains: cutting $2 trillion without affecting core programs like Medicare and Social Security is quite literally a Herculean task.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-the-grinch-trumpgri-solana-memecoin-will-explode-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38309393,https://crypto.news/?p=14323332,1735570100,FTX payouts are coming: how high can FTT price get?,"The FTX Token has performed well this year, significantly outperforming other cryptocurrencies as attention shifts to the impending fund distributions FTX Token ( FTT ) was trading at $3.50 on Monday, marking a rise of over 245% from its September lows, and pushing its market cap to over $1.1 billion These gains could persist into January as FTX’s bankruptcy case reaches its final stages. The upcoming phase will involve the distribution of over $16 billion in funds to creditors and customers. In mid-December, the FTX Estate announced that a U.S. court had approved a Chapter 11 Reorganization plan set to take effect on January 3. Creditors can begin making claims on that date, with the initial distributions expected 60 days later. You might also like: AI Companions, AGLD, Acala prices rise as Bitcoin drops below $93k FTX Estate has selected BitGo , a leading crypto custodian, and Kraken as key intermediaries for the process. Additional partners may be added to manage the large-scale distribution. The growing anticipation surrounding these events has contributed to the recent FTT rally. FTX, once one of the world’s largest centralized cryptocurrency exchanges with a $30 billion valuation, collapsed in 2022 following revelations of fund commingling. Since then, Sam Bankman-Fried has been sentenced to 25 years in prison. Ryan Salame, a senior executive at the company, was sentenced to 7.5 years, but our reporting suggests that it could be reduced by over one year. Caroline Elision was sentenced to 2 years for collaborating with prosecutors. FTX Token price analysis FTT price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows FTT has been in a strong bullish trend since bottoming at $1.013 in July. It has climbed to the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. FTT remains above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which formed a golden cross pattern on October 7—a bullish signal in technical analysis. However, there are indications of a double-top pattern forming at $4.31, with a neckline at $2.50. A double-top is a common reversal pattern, suggesting a potential price pullback as market participants price in the distributions. On the other hand, a breakout above the $4.31 resistance could trigger further gains, potentially pushing FTT to its 2023 high of $5.95—approximately 75% above its current level. A drop below the $3 support would invalidate the bullish outlook.

Make All Your Wishes Come True with the XYZ winning team! Toncoin (TON) Toncoin is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized and open-source blockchain. It was originally developed by Telegram as the Telegram Open Network with the 'Gram' token. However, Telegram discontinued the project in May 2020 due to regulatory issues. Since then, the non-commercial TON Foundation and community enthusiasts have taken over its development. Toncoin operates on a proof-of-stake model, which enhances scalability and reliability. It aims to provide fast and secure payment services with minimal fees. The project also seeks to develop a comprehensive ecosystem that includes decentralized storage, services, DNS, anonymous networking, and efficient payment processing. Based on historical price movements and Bitcoin halving cycles, Toncoin's price could reach as high as $30.30 by 2025. This represents a potential gain of 348.18% compared to today's price if it reaches the upper target. By 2030, it could hit up to $26.04, gaining 285.24% if it meets the forecast. Toncoin's ambitious goals and strong technology make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Its focus on speed, security, and low fees sets it apart from many other cryptocurrencies. With strong community support and ongoing development, Toncoin might become a significant player as the crypto market evolves. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is more than just another dog-themed cryptocurrency. Inspired by Dogecoin's success, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it access to a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB started with a staggering supply of one quadrillion tokens. In a bold move, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, a gesture meant to build trust in the crypto community. Buterin's donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund, followed by burning 40% of the total supply, put SHIB in the spotlight and reduced its circulating supply significantly. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum opens doors to exciting possibilities. Projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, show its potential beyond being a simple meme token. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a governance system where holders can have a say in development. In the current market cycle, where utility and real-world applications are gaining importance, SHIB's approach sets it apart from other meme coins like Dogecoin. While Dogecoin relies mainly on community and celebrity endorsements, SHIB aims to build a robust ecosystem. This could make it an interesting player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Sui (SUI) Sui is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that's catching attention. Designed for global use, it offers security, power, and scalability. At its core, Sui uses a novel object-centric data model. This allows for efficient transaction processing. It also employs the Move programming language, known for its security features. These innovations help Sui solve issues that other blockchains struggle with. What sets Sui apart is its focus on user experience. It aims to remove common barriers in blockchain interactions. Features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions make applications more accessible. In a market where coins like Ethereum face high fees and slow speeds, Sui offers a promising alternative. Its technology could make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. By prioritizing usability, Sui might lead the next wave in crypto adoption. Hedera (HBAR) Have you heard about HBAR? It's the digital coin of Hedera Hashgraph, a new kind of network that's different from Bitcoin and Ethereum. Instead of using a traditional blockchain, Hedera uses something called hashgraph. This makes transactions really fast, cheap, and good for the environment. There’s no mining involved, so it uses less energy. HBAR is used to pay for transactions and to keep the network secure through a system called Proof of Stake. So, is HBAR a good pick in today's crypto market? Hedera's technology promises quicker and more secure transactions than many other coins. Its low fees and high speed make it attractive for businesses, especially in finance. While some worry that its patented technology might limit community involvement compared to open-source projects like Ethereum, big companies are backing Hedera. As the crypto world looks for more efficient and eco-friendly options, HBAR could stand out as a promising choice for the future. Conclusion TON, SHIB, SUI, and HBAR have strong potential, but XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, aims for 20,000% growth in the 2024 bull run.

Here is the Leading Exchange!,"The cryptocurrency market witnessed a major turning point this December as trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) hit a record high of $320.5 billion. Decentralized Exchange Volume Breaks Record, Reaching $320 Billion in December This marks the first time that DEX’s monthly volume has crossed the $300 billion threshold, eclipsing the previous all-time high of $299.6 billion set in November. Uniswap Leads the Pack Uniswap has solidified its position as the dominant player in the DEX space, topping the charts with over $103 billion in trading volume. PancakeSwap follows with $72 billion, while Solana-based Raydium comes in third with $54.6 billion. Other notable participants include Aerodrome and Curve. Min Jung, research analyst at Presto Research, attributed this increase to the growing appeal of decentralized platforms. “Many of the most in-demand cryptocurrencies today, such as AI agents, are listed only on DEXs,” Jung said. “Projects like Hyperliquid demonstrate a growing market perception that a centralized exchange (CEX) listing is no longer necessary to achieve significant market value.” Central Stock Exchange Volume Also Rising This momentum was not limited to DEXs. Spot trading volume on centralized exchanges (CEX) also reached $2.78 trillion in December, reaching its highest level since May 2021. This represented a 137% jump from October to November, driven in part by renewed optimism following the re-election of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump as US President. Binance continued to dominate the centralized market with around $950 billion in trading volume. Other exchanges like Crypto.com, Upbit, Bybit and Coinbase also saw significant activity in December, trading hundreds of billions of dollars. *This is not investment advice.

38309342,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634840,1735569684,Grayscale Research updates the list of the top 20 crypto assets in Q1 2025,"Grayscale Research has unveiled its updated list of the top 20 crypto assets for the first quarter of 2025, reflecting evolving market trends and key themes shaping the digital asset landscape. The revised list includes six new additions: Hyperliquid (HYPE), Ethena (ENA), Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), Jupiter (JUP), Jito (JTO), and Grass (GRASS). The crypto market witnessed a significant upturn in Q4 2024, driven largely by a favorable reaction to the US election results. According to Grayscale, total industry market capitalization tripled, rising from $1 trillion to $3 trillion during the quarter, as measured by the FTSE/Grayscale Crypto Sectors indexes. Grayscale noted that the market rally was particularly pronounced in the Smart Contract Platforms sector, where Solana outperformed Ethereum, the category leader.

Investors have increasingly turned their attention to alternative layer 1 networks such as Sui and The Open Network (TON), further intensifying competition in this space. Grayscale’s crypto sector framework expands Reflecting the surge in market valuations, Grayscale’s quarterly rebalancing added 63 new assets to its Crypto Sectors index, bringing the total to 283 tokens. The Consumer & Culture sector saw the most growth, buoyed by strong returns for memecoins and appreciation in gaming and social media-related assets. Grayscale Research’s top 20 crypto assets. Source: Grayscale. The asset manager highlighted that the digital asset industry’s market cap is now comparable to the global inflation-linked bond market. It surpasses the US high-yield bond market but remains smaller than the global hedge fund industry and the Japanese equity market. Grayscale emphasized three central themes for Q1 2025: regulatory implications of the US election on DeFi and staking, advances in decentralized AI technologies, and the growth of the Solana ecosystem. Among the new additions, Hyperliquid (HYPE) stood out as a layer 1 blockchain designed to support on-chain financial applications. Its primary offering is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for perpetual futures, leveraging a fully on-chain order book. Ethena (ENA) also made the list, having introduced a novel stablecoin, USDe, backed by hedged positions in Bitcoin and Ether. This stablecoin, alongside a staked version that generates returns from differences in spot and futures prices, represents an innovative approach to stablecoin design. Another notable addition was Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), a platform on the Ethereum layer 2 network, Base, that facilitates the creation of tokenized AI agents. These agents are designed to autonomously perform tasks, interact with their environment, and mimic human decision-making. Jupiter (JUP), the leading decentralized exchange aggregator on Solana, garnered interest, particularly among retail traders exploring Solana-based memecoins and AI-related tokens. Another Solana-based asset, Jito (JTO), according to the release, also gained substantial adoption as a liquid staking protocol, generating over $550 million in fee revenue in 2024. Lastly, Grayscale shed light on Grass (GRASS), a decentralized data network that compensates users for sharing unused internet bandwidth through a Chrome extension. The bandwidth is used to scrape online data, which is then sold to AI companies and developers for machine learning model training. Crypto industry trends and outlook for 2025 Alongside these additions, Grayscale retained several well-established assets on its top 20 list, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK), and Sui (SUI). The firm’s strategy incorporates factors such as network growth, upcoming catalysts, token valuation, and potential risks to select assets with high potential for the quarter. Meanwhile, the company is topping charts in Ethereum institutional holdings . According to Arkham Intelligence data, Grayscale is the largest institutional holder of Ethereum, managing ETH worth $6.62 billion. Grayscale also holds 249.029 BTC, which is valued at $23.33 billion at current valuations. Its portfolio also includes tokens like Chainlink (LINK), Livepeer (LPT), Avalanche (AVAX), and Basic Attention Token (BAT), totaling $46.23 million.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is more than just another dog-themed cryptocurrency. Inspired by Dogecoin's success, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it access to a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB started with a staggering supply of one quadrillion tokens. In a bold move, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, a gesture meant to build trust in the crypto community. Buterin's donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund, followed by burning 40% of the total supply, put SHIB in the spotlight and reduced its circulating supply significantly. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum opens doors to exciting possibilities. Projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, show its potential beyond being a simple meme token. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a governance system where holders can have a say in development. In the current market cycle, where utility and real-world applications are gaining importance, SHIB's approach sets it apart from other meme coins like Dogecoin. While Dogecoin relies mainly on community and celebrity endorsements, SHIB aims to build a robust ecosystem. This could make it an interesting player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It's a flexible, scalable blockchain designed for smart contracts. This means it can support decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, rivals Ethereum's ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work models. Cardano's structure divides its blockchain into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This boosts its capacity, with the goal of potentially handling up to a million transactions per second. In March 2021, Cardano introduced native tokens, offering secure, low-fee smart contract interactions. This sets a new standard for blockchain efficiency and scalability. In the current market, ADA looks attractive due to its sustainable technology and growth potential. As more investors seek eco-friendly crypto options, Cardano stands out. While Ethereum is still dominant, Cardano's advancements may position it as a strong alternative in the crypto landscape. Conclusion While SHIB and ADA are strong, XYZVerse (XYZ) combines sports and meme culture, aiming for significant growth and becoming a cultural icon in the 2024 bull run.

38308904,https://finbold.com/?p=224202,1735569160,Shiba Inu (SHIB) eyes 100% rally: Key levels to watch for long-term breakout,"Meme cryptocurrency Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) is experiencing a short-term price correction. However, technical indicators suggest that the token may be gearing up for a rebound, with analysts pinpointing critical levels that could support a potential upward surge. SHIB one-week price chart. Source: Finbold At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00002173, recording a 0.72% decline over the past week and extending its monthly losses to over 19%. Despite the recent pullback, the token remains up by an impressive 110% year-to-date, showcasing its resilience amid broader market fluctuations. Technical analysis and key levels to watch According to the analysis by Rose Premium Signals , SHIB’s price action is currently testing critical support levels that have historically preceded upward surges. Currently trading at $0.00002173, SHIB has slipped below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00002230, signaling persistent bearish pressure. However, the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00002170 now serves as a crucial support zone, potentially acting as a springboard for a rebound. SHIB price analysis chart. Source: Rose Premium Signals / X If SHIB manages to hold above $0.00002170 and reclaim the $0.00002230 level, it could pave the way for a recovery targeting the short-term resistance at $0.00003265. Beyond this, the token faces intermediate resistance at $0.00003870, with a long-term bullish target at $0.00004349, marking a potential 100% surge from current levels if bullish momentum sustains. On the flip side, a failure to hold the support at $0.00002170 may expose the token to further downside risks. Adding to the optimism surrounding Shiba Inu, analyst Javon Marks has also emphasized the token’s bullish technical setup, predicting it could climb to $0.000081 under favorable conditions. Such a rally would represent a 3.33-fold increase, translating to an impressive 234% gain from its current levels, as reported by Finbold. Ecosystem developments drive optimism Shiba Inu’s prospects are not solely tied to technical indicators but also to its network-specific developments that could catalyze future growth. The network’s layer-two scaling solution, Shibarium, has proven to be a game-changer, achieving significant milestones since its launch last summer. On 25, Shibarium surpassed 700 million total transactions, highlighting its effectiveness in improving transaction efficiency and adoption across the ecosystem. In addition, Shiba Inu is expanding its market presence with plans to introduce a stablecoin pegged at $0.01. This development will potentially enhance SHIB’s utility within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, unlocking new growth opportunities. Furthermore, the upcoming launch of the TREAT token, intended as a reward token within the ecosystem, is expected to provide multifaceted utility, further strengthening the network’s appeal and solidifying its long-term growth potential. AI predictions and investor outlook The bullish outlook is gaining further traction, with AI-driven projections suggesting the token could climb as high as $0.000081 while maintaining a base-case target of $0.000045 if steady growth persists. These projections, coupled with the ongoing ecosystem growth and technical analysis, paint a cautiously optimistic picture for Shiba Inu’s future. That said, investors should approach with caution, balancing the coin’s speculative nature against its evolving ecosystem and growth potential. While SHIB’s ambitious projections and milestones offer significant upside, careful monitoring of key technical levels and broader market conditions remains essential.

One sharp-eyed player noticed a clever clue for Maria, which many would have missed (spoiler alert). The Silent Hill 2 2024 remake was praised critically. It was also a commercial success when it came out in October. For modernizing a game that’s considered a survival horror masterpiece and has been around for a long time, Bloober Team has fans praising them for a successful remake. Since it first hit store shelves in 2001, players have grown to unravel the town’s deepest secrets, and this remake presents even more layers of foreshadowing for fans to explore. In Heaven’s Night Club, one fan, Rashmunchel, shared a screenshot of a neon “KISS” sign. When it appeared above Maria’s head, the sign’s reflection read “SICK.” Ironically, the ""KISS"" sign appears as ""SICK"" above Maria's head and the ""EXIT"" sign is in a cage. by u/Rashmunchel in silenthill The clue here is related to Maria being a manifestation of Mary, the terminally ill wife of James Sunderland. Throughout the game, Maria is seductive, but the “KISS-SICK” reflection has a little bit of a foreshadowing about Maria’s connection to Mary. Rashmunchel also noticed another detail: a caged EXIT sign above James’ head might be an indication of the notion that he can’t get out of his own guilt and suffering. Fans praise the depth of Silent Hill 2 Fellow players were impressed with Rashmuchel’s finding of such a valuable clue. They also applauded the studios for such details. Much like James himself during the story was blinded by denial, some fans said they were so distracted by Maria’s flirtatious behavior that they did not catch the hidden message. The cleverly placed sign is just another reason fans love the remake. Given that horror game fans hold out for more Silent Hill remakes from Bloober Team, others choose to dive deep into the fog-shrouded town to explore more. Silent Hill 2 remains a prominent name in the horror genre of games. It seems like the players are happier to find all the hidden gems buried in the mist and share them with others.

Our internet is quickly being filled with automated slop. Blockchains are destined for the same treatment. It’s actually been happening for years. Take active address counts: In an entirely humanly-operated onchain world, active addresses would reflect the number of real users on any particular network. That’s obviously not the case, as Blockworks Research and the 0xResearch newsletter have already shown . Bots, spammers, airdrop farmers and other code-controlled entities commonly wield thousands — and even tens of thousands — of addresses. By the raw numbers, those players tend to drown out individual users. The active addresses metric really only says one thing about a network: how cheap it is to use (which makes spamming a breeze). Take that logic one step further and questions arise over how much of DEX volumes on chains like Solana and Base are the result of wash trading. Pump.fun’s cumulative active address count has swelled by ~4.5 million since the start of November Still, while Web2 struggles with its own transition into an AI-generated wasteland (check the mangled robot Christmas tunes that targeted unaware YouTube users this year), crypto is taking a more holistic approach. Embrace the slop. Make your own and tokenize it. Trade it. Pump.fun arguably was the first to perfect that roadmap. Virtuals Protocol wants to run it back by allowing users to create their own AI agents complete with their own tokens. Almost 300 AI agents are now on Virtual Protocol’s leaderboard. More than 12,600 token pairs have been created overall. For now, Virtuals is still small relative to Pump.fun. We’ve had almost a full year of the latter, with daily volumes going from under $1 million to as much as $5.6 billion in November. Virtuals’ AI agent launchpad has only been live since October, and its volume topped out at $24.5 million at the end of November. For what it’s worth, Virtuals’ cumulative daily active address count has skyrocketed from under 1,000 to 96,000 since the launchpad went live. Virtuals’ volume is back on the rise alongside its native token VIRTUAL — up 125% in the past month Of course, active address counts say very little about adoption from real users. Who knows how many of those new active addresses interacting with Virtuals were carbon-based lifeforms. Where crypto is headed, I’m not sure it even matters.

Meanwhile, Montenegro approved Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon's extradition to the US for trial, and Malaysian regulators ordered crypto exchange Bybit to cease operations in the country due to its unregistered status. Lawsuit Filed Against Solana Co-Founder Over Staking Rewards Stephen Akridge, co-founder of Solana and former principal engineer at Solana Labs, is facing legal action from his ex-wife Elisa Rossi. She claims that he secretly profited from her Solana (SOL) tokens through staking rewards.The lawsuit was filed in San Francisco’s Superior Court on Dec. 24, and alleges that Akridge earned millions of dollars in staking rewards from tokens she believes are hers, without her knowledge. According to Rossi, their divorce agreement in March divided their SOL token holdings, but she claims Akridge leveraged her lack of expertise in cryptocurrencies to keep control of the tokens. According to the lawsuit, Akridge allegedly granted Rossi access to three wallets containing the tokens but continued staking them under his own control. This allowed him to earn rewards until Rossi uncovered the scheme in May of 2024. Stephen Akridge Although the exact number of SOL tokens and the amount that was allegedly taken was not revealed, the complaint indicates the sum exceeds $25,000. Over the past year, Solana’s value surged, and also hit an all-time high of $263, fueled by its role in popular crypto trends like meme coins. Solana price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Rossi claims she repeatedly contacted Akridge between May and December about the staking rewards. However, she alleges that Akridge dismissed her concerns and even taunted her by reportedly stating, “Good luck getting those staking rewards from me.” Akridge currently serves as CEO of the cybersecurity company Cyber Grant, and has not commented on the situation. Blockchain Association Sues IRS Elisa Rossi’s lawsuit was not the only crypto-related legal action that was filed recently. The Blockchain Association and the Texas Blockchain Council filed a lawsuit against the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in response to new cryptocurrency reporting regulations. The rules were announced on Dec. 27, and require brokers, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and platforms facilitating digital asset transactions, to report gross proceeds and taxpayer information starting in 2027. This is a major expansion of the existing reporting requirements to include decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and smart contract-based exchanges. Kristin Smith , CEO of the Blockchain Association, stated in a Dec. 28 post that the lawsuit challenges the IRS’ new regulations as unconstitutional and a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Under the new rules, DeFi platforms that have control or influence over transaction processes could be classified as brokers, making them subject to very strict reporting obligations. The Blockchain Association criticized the regulations, and argued that they impose unlawful compliance burdens on software developers building front-end trading infrastructure. The organization also warned that these requirements could stifle innovation and push blockchain technology offshore. The move raised some privacy concerns for DeFi users, and some legal experts even labeled the IRS’ actions an infringement on individuals' rights. Marisa Coppel, Head of Legal at the Blockchain Association, argued that the rules could undermine the growing decentralized technology ecosystem and force innovators to relocate outside the United States. The controversy happened in the wake of other high-profile legal actions targeting blockchain developers, like the conviction of Tornado Cash developer Alex Pertsev, who was sentenced to over five years for money laundering. Critics see this as part of a broader pattern of regulatory overreach affecting the crypto industry. The IRS estimates that the new regulations will impact between 650 and 875 DeFi brokers and up to 2.6 million US taxpayers. Brokers will need to begin collecting the required data in 2026, with reporting mandated from 2027. For now, the Blockchain Association vowed to continue its fight against what it deems misguided rulemaking. Do Kwon’s Extradition to the US Approved Meanwhile, Montenegro’s Minister of Justice, Bojan Božović, approved the extradition of Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon to the United States. This decision was made after the dismissal of Kwon’s appeal by Montenegro’s Constitutional Court. Simultaneously, the Ministry of Justice rejected South Korea’s request to extradite Kwon as the majority of legal criteria supported the United States’ case. Kwon faces charges in both the US and South Korea, and has been at the center of a long and contentious extradition process that saw many decisions being reversed. Initially, Montenegro’s High Court of Podgorica approved Kwon’s extradition in November of 2023 but left the final decision on the receiving country to the justice minister. In May of 2024, Kwon’s legal team successfully appealed the decision and pushed the case to Montenegro’s highest court. Do Kwon In August of 2024, Montenegro’s Appellate Court upheld a lower court ruling to extradite Kwon to South Korea. However, in September, the case was sent back to the justice minister after officials determined that Kwon met the conditions for extradition to either country. A decision favoring the United States was initially reached in October, but it was also delayed due to a final appeal by Kwon’s legal team. With the Constitutional Court rejecting Kwon’s appeal and the Ministry of Justice confirming the US as the receiving jurisdiction, this decision likely finally brings an end to the legal proceedings. Kwon now faces trial in the United States for charges related to his activities at Terraform Labs. Bybit Ordered to Exit Malaysia Malaysia’s Securities Commission (SC) directed crypto exchange Bybit to stop its operations in the country due to its status as an unregistered digital asset exchange (DAX). The regulator ordered Bybit to disable its website, mobile applications, and any digital platforms accessible to Malaysian users in 14 business days starting Dec. 11. Additionally, Bybit was also instructed to stop any advertisements targeting Malaysian investors and to shut down its Telegram support group for local users. By Dec. 27, the SC confirmed that Bybit complied with all of the directives. The enforcement action is part of the growing scrutiny of cryptocurrency platforms in Malaysia. The SC placed a lot of emphasis on the importance of operating as a Recognised Market Operator (RMO) under the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007, and warned that unregistered entities expose investors to risks like money laundering and fraud. The commission urged Malaysian investors to only engage with licensed platforms that meet regulatory requirements designed to protect users. Bybit’s exit from Malaysia happened shortly after the exchange announced it would halt operations in France due to increased regulatory oversight. Beginning Jan. 8 of 2025, Bybit will suspend withdrawal and custody services for French users. Malaysia ramped up its efforts to regulate the crypto industry and combat related crimes. In June 2024, the Inland Revenue Board launched “Ops Token,” targeting tax evasion through crypto trading.

Ethereum: A Leading Proof-of-Stake Blockchain with Smart Contract Innovation Ethereum is a blockchain platform that introduced smart contracts, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi). It transitioned to Proof-of-Stake in 2022 with the Merge, aiming for greater efficiency and scalability. Ether (ETH) is its native cryptocurrency, used for transactions and rewarding those who validate the network. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon enhance transaction speed and reduce costs. Upcoming features like sharding are expected to further improve scalability. With its extensive ecosystem and ongoing technological advancements, Ethereum continues to be a central platform in the crypto space. In the current market cycle, its developments position it as a significant player in blockchain technology. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it started with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum allows it to support applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans for a future NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system are underway. In the current market, SHIB’s expanding utility and integration with Ethereum positions it as a notable project in the crypto space. Conclusion In the current bull run, SHIB and SOL may offer less short-term potential. Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, it invites enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains.

38308178,https://finbold.com/?p=224192,1735567580,XRP meme coin price soars 85% in a day,"A wider cryptocurrency market bull run ignited in early November. While large-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) saw significant moves to the upside, altcoins and meme coins saw even more impressive gains in the tail end of 2024. While we’ve seen already established meme coins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ) provide triple-digit returns, the meme coin market is no less dynamic than it was last year — and even completely new entrants are seeing rapid moves to the upside. Recently, a meme coin on the XRP Ledger saw one such significant increase in price — at present, Kitty Cup (KCUP) is trading some 85.66% above yesterday’s prices. The question is — is this rally at all sustainable? KCUP was launched on October 22 — at present, it is trading at $0.001129, up from $0.0006114 on December 29, and has a total market capitalization of just $1 million. KCUP price 1-day chart. Source: TradingView The rise of this XRP meme coin is impressive — but likely won’t continue As seen in the chart above, KCUP’s price action has been quite volatile in the near term. Such sharp movements are indicative of low liquidity. Except for the largest candles seen in the chart, KittyCup does indeed exhibit a low level of trading volume. In addition, there was no notable catalyst behind the surge — this was apparently just another instance of the Internet really loving cats , which are arguably one of the most common sources of memes in general. https://twitter.com/KittyCupCoin/status/1873381433903047085 Nonetheless, when utility and fundamentals are out of the question, investors simply move on to other criteria they consider important. There is a significant degree of optimism regarding KCUP online — with traders citing the fact that it is the only cat-themed cryptocurrency on the XRP ledger and that the meme it is based on has demonstrated a strong degree of staying power in an otherwise ephemeral space. While those arguments certainly might be true, this is still essentially a bet on the opaque whims of the Internet — there are no reliable ways to analyze an asset such as this, so it, unfortunately, remains relegated to being a speculative bet.

This platform may be the core center for deploying AI projects built on the Eliza framework, with its native token serving as the base currency for agent-to-agent interactions. In addition, the launchpad could employ various value capture mechanisms, such as strategic liquidity pool pairings, ai16z token stake for access, and launch fees.

VeChain's VET Token: Enhancing Supply Chain Transparency with Blockchain VeChain is a blockchain platform focused on smart contract solutions for supply chains. Its native token, VET, ranks among the top 40 by market cap, indicating significant adoption. VeChain assigns unique IDs and sensors to physical products, enabling detailed tracking through the supply chain. This helps industries like fashion, food, and automotive verify authenticity and manage recalls. Founded by Sunny Lu, ex-CIO at Louis Vuitton China, VeChain launched its own blockchain, VeChainThor, in 2018. With partnerships with firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers, Walmart China, and BMW, VeChain's real-world applications are expanding. Given its utility and strong industry ties, VET appears attractive in the current market cycle. Terra Classic (LUNC): A Blockchain for Stable Global Payments Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain protocol that uses stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies to enable price-stable global payments. It combines the stability of traditional currencies with the censorship-resistant features of cryptocurrencies. The original Terra chain, launched in April 2019, was rebranded as Terra Classic after a new chain was created in May 2022. The native token LUNA became LUNA Classic (LUNC), and the stablecoins were renamed accordingly. Terra Classic aims to offer fast and affordable settlements. Its potential lies in facilitating global transactions with minimal volatility. In the current market cycle, the attractiveness of LUNC depends on its adoption and real-world use cases. Turbo: The First AI-Created Memecoin Turbo is the first memecoin created by artificial intelligence. It began as an experiment when the founder asked GPT-4 to design a new meme coin. The result is Turbo Token, a cryptocurrency made by AI for the people. The coin leverages AI technology, aiming to bring innovation to the meme coin space. Its creation by GPT-4 demonstrates the potential of AI in cryptocurrency development. The use of AI in creating Turbo may lead to new possibilities in how cryptocurrencies are developed and managed. Turbo's innovative approach could set a trend for future projects. Its alignment with technological advancements positions it well in the evolving crypto market. In the current market cycle, Turbo's unique origin and technology make it an appealing option. JasmyCoin (JASMY): Empowering Data Sovereignty in the IoT Era JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency developed by Jasmy Corporation, a Tokyo-based Internet of Things (IoT) provider focused on data transactions. The platform integrates IoT and blockchain technologies to restore and protect individual data sovereignty, giving users full control over their personal information.

Jasmy offers a robust infrastructure and intuitive interface, aiming to facilitate safe and efficient data sharing, which holds significant potential in the evolving digital economy. Conclusion VET, LUNC, TURBO, and JASMY have less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking the best in life, stands out. Expected 700% growth by presale's end, with potential thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN aims for record-breaking success. Building a community of leaders, it offers real benefits, including exclusive perks for early adopters.

38307981,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=668105,1735567204,Cardano Holds Crucial Support At $0.77 – Massive Rally Ahead?,"Cardano (ADA) has faced a challenging period, experiencing a sharp 42% correction since reaching a multi-year high of $1.32 in early December. This significant decline reflects the broader market uncertainty, with increased selling pressure and cautious investor sentiment weighing heavily on ADA’s price. Despite this, on-chain data suggests a shift in dynamics, hinting at a potential recovery for the embattled cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Moves 8,000 BTC Aged 5-7 Years – What Happened Last Time Top analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted key metrics indicating whale accumulation in recent weeks, adding a layer of optimism to ADA’s outlook. According to Martinez, Cardano’s most significant support zone lies between $0.77 and $0.68, a range that has been consistently respected by the market. This support has proven crucial in stabilizing ADA’s price, providing a base from which a recovery could materialize. The sustained interest from large holders signals confidence in ADA’s long-term potential, even amid short-term volatility. As Cardano continues to defend critical support levels, market participants are watching closely for signs of a breakout. With whale activity increasing and technical indicators aligning, Cardano’s next moves could redefine its trajectory, offering a glimmer of hope in an otherwise challenging environment. Cardano Setting The Stage For A Move Cardano has faced a sharp downturn following its explosive rally in November, entering a phase of deep correction that rattled investor confidence. Despite the recent pullback, ADA appears to be finding stability as it consolidates above critical support levels, sparking renewed optimism for a potential rebound. Prominent analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, identifying Cardano’s most significant support zone between $0.77 and $0.68. According to Martinez, ADA’s price action has closely respected this range, reinforcing its importance in preventing further declines. Should ADA continue to hold above this level for a few more days, the groundwork for a strong recovery could be laid, potentially reversing the bearish trend. Adding to the positive outlook is the behavior of large market participants. On-chain data reveals significant whale activity during this consolidation phase, suggesting that major investors are taking advantage of the lower prices to accumulate ADA. This pattern of accumulation often signals growing confidence in a project’s long-term potential, even in the face of short-term price volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought Over 90 Million DOGE In 48H – Details As ADA holds its ground above the crucial support zone, market participants eagerly await a breakout. If a sustained rebound occurs, it could position Cardano for a powerful rally, reclaiming recent losses and potentially testing new highs. Price Action: Key Supply To Test Cardano is currently trading at $0.87, grappling with increased selling pressure that has kept its price subdued. Despite the challenges, ADA has demonstrated resilience by holding above key support levels, indicating that buyers are still active in the market. However, the next few days will be crucial for determining its direction. A significant price milestone lies at the $1 mark, which has acted as a psychological resistance level in recent weeks. If ADA can successfully reclaim $1 with strong volume and momentum, it could pave the way for a massive rally. Such a breakout would likely see ADA targeting its yearly high of $1.32, a level last reached during its impressive November rally. Clearing this resistance would signal renewed bullish sentiment and potentially attract additional buying interest. Related Reading: A 20%-30% Correction Is ‘The Most Bullish Thing’ That Could Happen To Bitcoin – Analyst On the downside, the risk of a deeper retracement remains if selling pressure intensifies. ADA could test lower demand zones around $0.75, which aligns with historical support levels. This scenario would likely lead to a period of further consolidation as the market seeks equilibrium. For now, ADA remains at a crossroads, with both opportunities for recovery and risks of further downside in play.

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world!🚀 Dogecoin's Rise: How a Meme Coin Became a Top Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) was launched in 2013 as a fun alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the ""Doge"" meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. In 2021, its value surged, driven by social media influence and support from figures like Elon Musk, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Dogecoin showcases the power of community and social media in shaping financial markets. Its potential lies in its strong community support and widespread recognition. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin's popularity may make it an attractive option for investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that started as a meme inspired by Dogecoin but has grown to offer more. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain. This gives it access to Ethereum's vast ecosystem. Half of its initial supply was sent to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can support projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and has plans for NFTs and a DAO-based governance system. These developments could increase SHIB's utility. In the current market cycle, SHIB's expanding features may make it an attractive option. Conclusion Coins like DOGE and SHIB may have less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, stands out. With an expected 700% presale growth and potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows in the footsteps of BONK, WIF, and Popcat, offering real benefits and uniting a community of market leaders.

38309282,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323365,1735566813,Analysts Name Stagflation ‘The Theme of 2025’ as Bitcoin Faces Critical Zone,"Initial jobless claims are due on January 2nd, but stagflation concerns are the real elephant in the room for Bitcoin price projections running into 2025 . According to a Kobeissi Letter written in an X thread on December 29th, “Investors are worried that we will see a repeat of the 1970s inflation situation. The Fed is cutting rates due to a weaker labor market while inflation rebounds.” While the Federal Reserve has one month to go until its next meeting on interest rates, markets continue to price out the likelihood of further rate cuts next year. The beginning of stagflation is here and the Fed has yet to acknowledge it. We could see 4%+ inflation next year. What Does ‘Stagflation’ Mean for Bitcoin? This potential stagflation scenario, marked by high inflation and stagnant economic growth, could significantly impact Bitcoin’s performance. Historically, Bitcoin has been seen as a hedge against inflation, but its correlation with traditional markets and sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions may introduce volatility. While navigating a potential U.S. recession was the macroeconomic talking point driving price action in 2024, Kobeissi said it expects stagflation to become “the theme of 2025.” “In fact, 55% of high net worth investors expect stagflation in 2025,” it concluded, referencing data from a survey by Bank of America (BoA). BoA economic outlook survey. Source: The Kobeissi Letter/X Bitcoin Faces Critical Bull Market Phase This all stands to define a critical phase in Bitcoin’s bull market, with the late-month 15% correction over the past week yet to find a decisive floor. This drawdown is decidedly on the lower end of historical behavior when comparing bull market drawdowns to previous cycles, according to Glassnode data . Bitcoin bull market correction drawdowns. Source: Glassnode While this could allude to a bottom much deeper, Glassnode pointed to short-term holders (STHs) to identify when the market could bounce. Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric, comparing STH supply in profit to that in loss, suggests potential seller exhaustion as it nears a break-even point. Point-In-Time Short-Term Holder (STH) Profit/Loss Ratio. Source: Glassnode Glassnode notes MVRV as a reliable indicator of “local bottoms in bull markets and local tops in bear markets.” The last time that Point-In-Time Short-Term Holder (STH) Profit/Loss Ratio saw levels below 1 was in early October when BTC/USD traded at $60,000. This bullish sentiment is echoed by a recent Maxiport report , citing Bitcoin to have “matured” this cycle, with adoption leaving it better leveraged against volatility. Market dynamics are shifting. Unlike past cycles characterized by sharp 80% drawdowns, Bitcoin’s growing base of dip buyers and institutional support reduces the likelihood of severe corrections. With these indicators in mind, Bitcoin’s resilience amid current macroeconomic uncertainties highlights its potential to navigate through this critical phase.

38307751,https://crypto.news/?p=14323293,1735566668,PNUT whale activity intensifies ahead of key exchange listings,"Speculation about possible listings on two major exchanges may have reignited whale interest, driving PNUT’s recent rally. Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ) rose 15.4% over the past 24 hours, exchanging hands at $0.7102 while bringing its market cap to over $710 million. The meme coin’s daily trading volume was also up 190%, hovering over $596 million at press time. PNUT’s rally came despite a 1.8% drop in the broader meme coin market, valued at $107.3 billion, and a 3.1% drop in the global crypto market, which stood at $3.41 trillion at press time. Why did PNUT surge? The meme coin rallied as whales took up interest in it. According to a Dec. 30 X post by on-chain tracker Spot On Chain, a whale withdrew 10 million PNUT tokens, worth approximately $6.1 million, from the crypto exchange Binance. Nearly all the tokens were transferred to a decentralized wallet labeled “76yGJ,” making it the sixth-largest PNUT holder. Notably, the tokens withdrawn mark 1% of the total supply of PNUT tokens in circulation. Just three days earlier, crypto.news reported that a different whale had transferred 15,140 SOL to heavily invest in PNUT and two other popular meme coins. The move mirrors a trend from Dec. 12, when another whale withdrew 8.41 million PNUT tokens, valued at $10.68 million at the time, from Binance after creating a new wallet. Whale accumulation is typically viewed as a bullish signal for an asset’s price, as retail traders often follow these investment patterns, anticipating an uptrend in the asset while aiming to make quick gains from the potential price surge. PNUT’s rally also came amid a surge in demand from futures traders. According to data from CoinGlass, the open interest in its futures market has jumped 35% over the previous day to over $222.92 million when writing.

However, the biggest catalyst likely driving the Squirrel-themed token’s price surge appears to be market speculation surrounding a possible listing of the altcoin in two of the premier exchanges in the U.S., Coinbase and Robinhood. Coinbase officially included the asset in its listing roadmap on Dec. 11. However, the exchange is yet to unveil an exact date when the token would be available for trading. Meanwhile, market commentators also speculate that Robinhood will list the meme coin as it has already secured a listing on top-tier global exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Bybit, among others. More recently, PNUT was listed on Blockchain.com and the Indian crypto exchange Zebpay. Meme coins typically tend to strongly rally following a listing on a major centralized exchange due to the added exposure. As crypto.news reported earlier PNUT rallied over 20% after Coinbase said it was considering listing it. Community sentiment surrounding the meme coin appears largely bullish, with 78% of 73.6k votes anticipating further gains, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, per CoinCarp , the total number of PNUT holders rose by 10% in December, contributing to improved liquidity and a stronger community base. $pnut double bottom pattern is in Attempting a strong reversal pic.twitter.com/RLfkeJ6MG7 — Dami-Defi (@DamiDefi) December 30, 2024 Read more: Peanut the Squirrel owner takes legal action against Binance for listing PNUT, boosting his JFP token by 200%",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/pnut-whale-activity-intensifies-ahead-of-key-exchange-listings/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/38307751.jpeg

38309873,https://invezz.com/?p=2410897,1735566600,Hong Kong calls for creation of a Bitcoin national reserve,"Hong Kong should leverage its “one country, two systems” policy to include Bitcoin in its national reserves, according to Legislative Council member Wu Jiexhuang. Speaking to local media outlet Wen Wei Po, the legislator said Bitcoin holds the potential to attract foreign investments and talent to the special administrative region while also holding the potential to strengthen the country’s financial stability. Jiexhuang referred to efforts around the globe across small nations like El Salvador and Bhutan, which have already integrated the flagship cryptocurrency into their reserves. He also touched upon developments in the United States , where incoming President Donald Trump has vowed to make Bitcoin a reserve asset. Jiexhuang believes such initiatives by major economic powers could stabilise Bitcoin’s value, prompting other nations to follow suit and reduce their reliance on traditional assets. He added that this could impact the traditional sector, ultimately “shrinking the government’s fiscal reserves holding traditional assets.” Further, he compared Bitcoin’s storage convenience to traditional precious metals like gold and silver, arguing that Bitcoin’s lower storage and logistics costs could make it a preferable reserve asset over time. As such, Jiexhuang is urging Hong Kong to seize a first-mover advantage by exploring the inclusion of Bitcoin in its reserves early in hopes that it could mitigate disruptions caused by adoption across global financial systems. However, the legislator acknowledged the risks involved with Bitcoin and recommended that it should constitute only a small portion of the reserves. He suggested leveraging Hong Kong’s unique position under the “one country, two systems” to fuel these efforts. This unique arrangement grants Hong Kong greater financial and regulatory flexibility, allowing it to experiment with innovative financial strategies—such as integrating Bitcoin into its reserves—without directly impacting mainland China’s financial policies. He concluded that Hong Kong should carefully monitor developments in the US and adopt a cautious strategy. “If it is observed that the U.S. continues to increase its Bitcoin holdings, the Hong Kong government should carefully consider holding a proportionate amount of Bitcoin in its reserves.” It must be noted that China already holds a sizeable portion of the flagship crypto, with its current holdings standing at 190,000, according to Wen Wei Po. This makes the country the second largest holder of Bitcoin after the US. Bitcoin reserve movement grows strong Around the world, calls for the creation of Bitcoin reserves have intensified among policymakers, especially since Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 earlier this month. On December 30, former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner called upon the country’s central bank to include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a reserve asset, building upon MP Joana Cotar’s similar efforts earlier this year. Elsewhere, French Parliament Member Sarah Knafo said during a December 17 speech that European nations should start considering building a national Bitcoin reserve and focus on developing the crypto-mining industry. Last month, Polish minister and presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen vowed to create a Bitcoin reserve and introduce crypto-friendly rules if he’s elected in 2025.

38307686,https://crypto.news/?p=14323280,1735566539,Hong Kong lawmaker wants to add Bitcoin to national reserves to boost financial security,"Hong Kong legislator Wu Jiexhuang suggested the region should start adding Bitcoin to its national reserves as a way to boost financial security. According to the local newspaper Wen Wei Po , Wu said Hong Kong regulators should study the impact of U.S-issued Bitcoin exchange-traded funds on the market as a starting point before they decide to add Bitcoin to the national reserve. He argued that Hong Kong authorities could take advantage of of China’s “one country, two systems” policy to include Bitcoin ( BTC ) in its national reserve for financial security. The newspaper noted that China currently holds the second largest Bitcoin reserve, worth 190,000 BTC from illegal trade confiscations. “If major economic powers take the initiative to include Bitcoin in strategic reserves, the value of Bitcoin will be more stable, causing more countries to follow suit and minimize their traditional asset holdings,” said Wu. The Council Member and Chairman of the Web3 Subcommittee on Virtual Asset Development did not recommend holding onto “small currencies.” Instead, he specifically recommended Bitcoin due to its high trading volume on the market, making it a more desirable asset compared to more traditional commodities like gold and silver. He mentioned El Salvador and Bhutan as examples of regions that have successfully added Bitcoin to their national reserves, as well as several U.S. states. You might also like: Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania to create the state-level Bitcoin reserves. What are these bills? In his interview with the news outlet, Wu pointed out that cryptocurrency is already integrated into Hong Kong’s financial institutions. For example, he mentioned there are already as many as 12 Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Moreover, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been known to invest in a “small portion” of cryptocurrency to diversify its assets. Wu believes that Bitcoin will be beneficial for preserving Hong Kong’s financial security. In testing the waters, he suggested that regulators apply the principle of “same business, same risk, same rules” when it comes to holding crypto assets within the national reserves. In the past few months, lawmakers in Japan, Russia and even the EU have made calls for governments to adopt Bitcoin in their national reserves. Although some countries have outright rejected the idea, others remain open to the possibility. The U.S. in particular have been leading the trend, though even some are doubtful it will happen. As previously reported by crypto.news on Dec. 11, another Hong Kong lawmaker named Johnny Ng also brought up the topic of adding cryptocurrencies to Hong Kong’s fiscal reserves. Though, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Joseph Chan responded by saying that crypto assets were not the target investment for Hong Kong’s Exchange Fund.

In the latest Shiba Inu news , the dog-themed meme coin could target a bullish upthrust to higher prices imminently. However, following a wider market downturn, it must ward off the prevailing bearish momentum around its ecosystem.For context, Shiba Inu recorded its third consecutive weekly downtrend, but with a mild correction compared to the previous weeks. The leading meme coin closed last week with a 1% drop, failing to sustain an earlier bullish momentum that saw it hit an intra-week high of $0.00002408.Shiba Inu Breaks Out from Bullish StructureA recent analysis from Rose Premium indicates that Shiba Inu could regain bullish momentum and rebound from the latest dip. The commentary cited a potential breach above a descending channel in the 1-day timeframe.The market speculator attached a chart suggesting a possible breakout from the channel, which started forming at the local top at $0.00003343 in early December. With the breakout, Rose Premium shared three price objectives for Shiba Inu, including a short-, intermediate-, and long-term target. Shiba Inu Price Targets per Rose Premium Meanwhile, the analyst expects Shiba Inu to meet resistance at $0.00003236 with the initial uptrend. A breach of the resistance will spur further upsides to the intermediate supply zone at $0.00003870.Additionally, Rose Premium asserted that the long-term target from the descending triangle breakout is a surge to $0.00004349. However, he stated that the nearly 100% price uptick would actualize if intense bullish momentum captured the market.Support Levels to WatchMeanwhile, Rose Premium indicated support levels to watch if Shiba Inu continues the downtrend. He marked the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00002230 as a potential demand zone and the 0.786 extension at $0.00002170 as a stronger support level.Notably, the support at $0.00002230 has failed to hold, with Shiba Inu falling further downwards. However, the second-largest meme coin by market cap has found solace in the $0.00002170 demand zone.Moreover, Shiba Inu could bounce from the area if the demand zone continues to cushion against further downtrends.

38307702,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634769,1735566396,Nvidia expands focus on humanoid robots amid increasing competition in the chip space,"US chip-making firm Nvidia is reportedly expanding its focus to humanoid robots next year amid intense competition from peers in the AI chip-making business. Nvidia’s vice president of robotics, Deepu Talla told the Financial Times that the company is expecting to introduce its next version of compact computers for humanoid robots during the first six months of 2025. Nvidia bets on the coming robotics boom Nvidia has played a significant role in driving the thriving AI industry with its chipmaking business. Its chips are in demand worldwide as the demand for AI systems continues to grow. However, stiff competition is also arising within the sector. This has pushed Nvidia to also look elsewhere. The $3.3 trillion company is now banking on the robotics boom projected in the near future. According to Caliber , humanoid robots are expected to become more present in industries, warehouses, automotive factories, and even in some homes in 2025, although it is yet uncertain how mainstream they will become. Now, the launch of Nvidia’s next version of compact computers for humanoid robots, Tetson Thor, will be a launchpad for its plans to be a top platform for this projected boom in AI robots. “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI and robotics is around the corner.” ~ Talla. Talla also told the Financial Times he believes that the market is at a “tipping point.” According to the Financial Times, this also comes as the chipmaking giant is expecting more rivalry from the likes of AMD. At the same time, competition from cloud computing titans like Google and Amazon cannot be overlooked. Nvidia is now channeling funds towards the “physical AI” space to help the new robotics firms grow. For instance, the company joined Microsoft and OpenAI in a February funding round that valued humanoid robotics company Figure AI at $2.6 billion. Robotics business is a small fraction of Nvidia’s earnings According to the Financial Times report, the robotics business represents a small share of Nvidia’s total revenue, although the chipmaking company did not give a breakdown of the figures from its robotics segment. During its third-quarter performance update released on November 30, Nvidia reported that data center revenue made up around 88% of the total $35.1 billion, which was 17% above the previous quarter and 94% from a year ago. According to the company , data center revenue alone was 17% ahead of the previous quarter and 112% from a year ago. Commenting on the financial statements then, CEO and founder Jensen Huang also acknowledged businesses were making investments into industrial robotics. “Industrial robotics investments are surging with breakthroughs in physical AI.” ~ Huang. According to a Cnet article , multiple humanoid robots are competing to secure their place in a crowded space, and next year is shaping up to be the “banner year for the marching metallic mechanisms made in our image.” Companies intensified AI robot efforts in 2024 During the past year, firms like Boston Dynamics revealed a new all-electric Atlas robot, while retiring its iconic hydraulic Atlas – now known as HD Atlas. The new robot can move in “superhuman ways.” Other companies, including Figure, Agility Robotics , and 1X, are also forging new partnerships with firms like OpenAI and Nvidia, using their hardware and software to assist robots in talking and performing different tasks faster than if they had to start from scratch. Companies like Elon Musk’s Tesla have notably chosen to use the data, hardware, and software it was developing for driver’s assistance in its cars and repackaging it in a new form factor with its Optimus robots. Meanwhile, in other robotics news, Pymnts also recently wrote about an MIT research that developed an AI system that could enable warehouse robots to handle odd-shaped packages and navigate crowded spaces without putting humans at risk. This development comes when retailers and logistics firms are grappling with rising pressure to automate amid surging e-commerce demand. The research shows that while robots excel at repetitive tasks like moving pallets, MIT’s PRoC3S technology tackles the long-standing challenge of robots handling more complex warehouse jobs safely. “In theory, PRoC3S could reduce a robot’s error rate by vetting its initial LLM-based assumptions against more specific and accurate understandings of the warehouse environment,” Erik Nieves, CEO and co-founder at Plus One Robotics, told Pymnts. “Think about it like this: A warehouse robot operating solely on LLM guidance has been described how to complete a task,” continued Nieves. He added that the PRoC3S goes a step further “by placing a digital robot in a simulated environment of that task.” According to Nieves, this basically shows the difference between classroom instruction and “a really good field trip.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nvidia-expands-focus-on-humanoid-robots/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38307702.jpeg

Among the most prominent names is Raghuram Rajan, a former director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This appointment caught the attention of the XRP community, with several commentators discussing the strategic significance of including such high-profile figures in the RLUSD project. Expertise Rajan Brings to Ripple Stablecoin Advisory BoardRajan served as the IMF's Director of Research and Chief Economist from 2003 to 2006. Later, he became the 23rd Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from September 2013 to September 2016. While at the RBI, he also became Vice-Chairman of the Bank for International Settlements in 2015.In 2005, at the Federal Reserve's annual Jackson Hole conference, Rajan warned about the increasing risks in the financial system. While predicting a potential financial crisis, he suggested measures to mitigate these risks. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers initial dismissed his predictions, labeling them as ""misguided."" However, after the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Rajan's warnings were widely recognized as prescient.In November 2008, Rajan took on the role of honorary economic adviser in India, contributing policy notes. In August 2012, he was appointed Chief Economic Adviser to India's Ministry of Finance.Now, Raghuram Rajan is joining the RLUSD advisory board to offer expert guidance on financial, regulatory, and operational matters, helping to ensure the stability and growth of Ripple's stablecoin. Rajan Bullish Comment on RLUSD LaunchCommenting on the launch of RLUSD , Rajan expressed that stablecoins have the potential to become the backbone of payments. According to him, they provide a secure and efficient alternative to traditional systems.He specifically highlighted that RLUSD, with its focus on compliance and reliability, aims to set new standards for trust and play a key role in shaping the future of payments. ""Joining the Advisory Board allows me to counsel RLUSD as it embarks on its journey in the rapidly evolving financial landscape,” Rajan concluded .Other Big Names in Ripple's RLUSD Advisory BoardIn the advisory role, Rajan will collaborate with Kenneth Montgomery, former Chief Operating Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Besides, Ripple's RLUSD advisory board already includes notable figures such as former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair, David Puth, Vice Chairman of Partners Capital, and Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/30/ex-imf-director-and-bank-of-india-governor-appointed-to-ripple-stablecoin-advisory-board/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ex-imf-director-and-bank-of-india-governor-appointed-to-ripple-stablecoin-advisory-board,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Following a significant political shift in the U.S., these crypto ETFs are flooding the market with massive inflows , reflecting a growing institutional embrace of digital assets. Bitcoin ETFs Set the Tone for 2024 Of the 740 ETFs launched this year, digital asset-focused ETFs have emerged as the dominant players, occupying the top eight spots for inflows. Notably, four of these ETFs track Bitcoin, while two focus on Ethereum. According to Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, the rising popularity of crypto ETFs is reshaping the investment landscape. The surge comes in the wake of the 2024 U.S. elections, where investors are hopeful about crypto-friendly policies under President Donald Trump’s administration, including plans to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Among the most sought-after ETFs are BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA, both products that have garnered heavy demand. There’s also a notable rise in demand for ETFs that track MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company making waves in the crypto space with its significant Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy’s impressive returns this year, coupled with its recent addition to the Nasdaq 100 index , have fueled investor interest in MSTR-focused ETFs. Sustained Inflows in Crypto ETFs Despite some fluctuations, crypto ETFs continue to see strong inflows. Between December 23 and 27, Bitcoin ETFs experienced a net outflow of $388 million, likely due to profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing. However, Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) stood out with a weekly net inflow of $183 million, indicating that certain investors remain confident in Bitcoin’s future. Bitcoin’s price has also faced some downward pressure, dropping below the $94,000 mark. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests that Bitcoin may rebound, but this is contingent upon the asset maintaining its critical support level at $93,000. On the Ethereum side, the sentiment is notably bullish . Despite Ethereum’s price hovering around $3,400, data from on-chain analysis and futures positions on BitMEX show a significant amount of optimism. Around 78.3% of traders holding open futures positions on BitMEX are betting on a price increase for Ethereum.

Could the recent price surge be a start towards its previous position? DOGE is recovering after a week of consolidation . This shows that DOGE could resume its run towards its $1 target if the upward trajectory is held. Monsta Mash ($MASH) , the newly introduced crypto, is currently attracting investors with its freshly launched Tap-to-Earn gameplay and hefty holiday bonuses. Buying pressure for $MASH is increasing as investors rush to secure $MASH before the current $0.0018 price doubles in the next phase. Solana To Trade Above Its ATH Of $264 in 2025 Solana has been among the best-performing cryptos over recent years. In November 2024, SOL reached a new ATH of $264 for the first time since 2021. After this rise, Solana began a downtrend dropping to $185, about 30% from it's all-time high. Some analysts believe that Solana's drop is a healthy correction while others believe the volatility could persist if technical issues are unresolved. Solana's price today is $192.44, down 1.25% in the last 24 hours. Some analysts predict that Solana could hit an ATH of $271 by 2025. Its ability to overcome technical obstacles and earn back the investors' confidence will be crucial to its future. Will DOGE HIT $1 Target in 2025? DOGE is trading below its 50EMA located at $0.36, which indicates a struggle to regain its bullish momentum. Despite the recent declines, its RSI is closer to the neutral zone at 42. For a new uptrend, DOGE needs to break through its 50 EMA at $0.36 to gain the market's positivity. If this is successful, it may target the upper resistance between $0.38 and $0.40. Dogecoin is trading at $0.320582 after losing 1.83% in the last 24 hours. By January the price of the DOGE is predicted to drop by 10.70% and reach $0.0285267. The meme coin recorded 43% green days with 12.67% price volatility over the past 30 days indicating a bearish trend. Monsta Mash (MASH) Booming Presale. Monsta Mash($MASH) is currently on its presale phase 2 trading at $0.0018 with over 94% sold out . Phase 3 is near with a new token price of $0.00365. Investors are rushing to buy $MASH ahead of the price increase for substantial capital gains in the coming year. The long-awaited Tap-to-Earn game is now available, Season 1 has launched with the app downloadable on Google Play and Apple App Store . Gamers and new Monsta Mash entrants are rushing to participate in this game which is simple and requires no previous experience. Moreover, there’s $MASH rewards for every challenge completed - whether millions of $MASH tokens or thousands in $USDT. The staking platform has also lured whale investments as it offers up to 19% APY on staked $MASH tokens, one of the highest rates in the crypto market. Monsta Mash Holiday Bonus Monsta Mash has filled the crypto market with excitement with the new 30% bonuses upon making purchases this festive season.

DOGE has been trading in the woods but its current price indicates it could regain its momentum. Monsta Mash on the other hand is showing high potential surpassing the older cryptos.

HYPE staking now live Hyperliquid is a performant layer-1 blockchain for on-chain finance whose flagship application is the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange. The platform offers spot and perpetuals trading and has gained massive traction since its highly successful token airdrop. The addition of staking sees Hyperliquid join other proof of stake networks that allow validators to propose new blocks. It opens up the community to seriously support growth initiatives as they benefit from their staked HYPE. With staking, HYPE holders will be able to lock up their tokens and earn rewards as they help secure the network. According to the announcement , the community will have the option to weigh their validator options by considering several metrics. These include their uptime, reputation, commission and community contributions. On the Hyperliquid mainnet, HYPE holders can stake their tokens via a trusted validator to earn staking rewards. These will be in the native token, currently with a circulating supply of 333,928,180. Notably, users can stake locked tokens. However, rewards from these staking positions will also be locked. The Hyper Foundation has plans to support best performing validators, with further decentralization efforts via a Delegation Program. HYPE price The HYPE token fell sharply earlier this past week, dropping by more than 20% in 24 hours. Declines followed community reaction to speculation that hackers affiliated to North Korea were snooping around for potential vulnerability. As Invezz reported on December 23, HYPE had revisited support levels around $26.50, with weakness allowing bears to touch lows of $24.16 on December 26. Currently, the value of Hyperliquid’s token stands at $28.16. While the altcoin has pared recent gains after hitting the all-time high of $34.96 reached on December 22, 2024, it’s still up more than 286% in the past month. Per CoinGecko data at the time of writing, HYPE’s value against the US dollar is up 634% from its all-time low of $3.81 reached on November 29, 2024. Also notable is the increase in daily volume, which is up more than 12% to nearly $180 million. Coinglass data shows open Interest in Hyperliquid has increased 4.07% to over $605 million.

Solana showed a 6.35% advance today with a trading volume of around $4 billion in the past 24 hours and a current price of $196.02 as of writing. Though there is still hope for SOL reaching $1,000, it is noteworthy that the token has not been able to top its all-time high (ATH) of $260. Savvy investors are focusing on Rexas Finance (RXS), a SOL rival ready to yield exponential returns, rather than waiting for a hypothetical Solana conference. RXS shows potential for a 9,900% breakout. Why Wait for $1,000 When $100 Can Multiply? Solana might increase to $1,000; hence, its present price reflects about 5x the return. Although this is noteworthy, it is minor compared to Rexas Finance's promise. Designed to tokenize real-world assets, RXS is a revolutionary project running at $0.175 per token in the 11th stage of presale. Having sold 381,888,220 tokens, it has raised $33,455,838 after already rising by an impressive 485% rise from its $0.030 initial presale price. Offering a startling 100x return—turning a $100 investment into $10,000 before Solana ever crosses $1,000—analysts believe RXS may climb to $17.50. What Makes Rexas Finance a Game-Changer? The Rexas Token Builder makes it easy for anyone to tokenize their actual assets without writing one word of code. Meanwhile, the Rexas Launchpad provides token creators with a simple fundraising tool. This ecosystem removes obstacles so that regular users and institutional investors may engage in asset tokenizing and funding possibilities. The RXS presale has been quite outstanding. Beginning in early September 2024 at $0.030, the token has jumped 485% to $0.175 in its 11th stage. Designed to honor early contributors, the project's presale system has already raised $33,455,838. This degree of acceptance implies hope for Rexas Finance's ability to upend multi-trillion-dollar sectors. All blockchain initiatives depend on security and openness. Hence, Rexas Finance shines on both sides. Certik, a leading blockchain security company, audits the platform to guarantee investor confidence. Unlike many initiatives dependent on venture money, Rexas Finance has adopted a community-centric approach, cultivating a committed network of individual investors who share its goal. Rexas Finance's listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko has strengthened its credibility. These systems track the coin in real time and give investors access to premium data, increasing its visibility. This ease of access facilitates investors' monitoring of RXS's development path. Apart from its sound principles, Rexas Finance has launched a $1 million giveaway to encourage involvement. Each of the twenty winners will get RXS tokens valued at $50,000. Participants can increase their chances by finishing tasks on the Rexas Finance website and spreading the campaign on social media, with over 648,353 entries so far. The Future of Blockchain and Real-World Assets Rexas Finance is in a unique position to close the distance between physical objects and blockchain technology. Supporting several token specifications, including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, the platform guarantees scalability and fit for several usage scenarios. Rexas Finance democratizes ownership by tokenizing assets across sectors, therefore opening hitherto unheard-of investment possibilities. The Path Forward: $17.50 Price Target Rexas Finance has a total supply of 1 billion RXS tokens; hence, the sky is the limit. Analysts believe that the coin's price can spike to $17.50 when the presale ends and its acceptance grows more general. This forecast results in a 100x return on the present presale price, making it among the most profitable investment prospects available on the market. Although Solana has the potential to reach $1,000, its growth path is restricted when compared to the explosive possibility of Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance gives early investors unparalleled value by tokenizing actual assets and building a strong ecosystem. RXS offers an entrance point at $0.175 that might turn a meager $100 investment into $10,000. Don't wait for Solana to reach $1,000; grab the chance with Rexas Finance and lead blockchain's next revolution from the front stage.

However, while meme coins capture attention, their utility remains limited. Enter Lightchain AI (LCAI) , a revolutionary blockchain project combining artificial intelligence and decentralization. With its ambitious roadmap and growing presale success, Lightchain AI aims to surpass not just meme coins but all competitors in dApp revenues by delivering impactful real-world solutions. Meme Coins Drive Solana dApp Revenues but Lack Sustained Utility In 2024, Solana's shared apps had a big jump in money, hitting $365 million in November, mostly pushed by funny coin sites. Clearly Pump.fun was the first Solana app to go past $100 million in one month of money making with $106 million. Even with this money growth, worries have come up about the long-term use of these meme coin places, since they often lack lasting uses beyond guessing trades. This brings up questions about ͏the lasting worth and steadiness of such income streams in the Solana ecosystem. Lightchain AI’s Vision Transforming dApp Revenues with AI-Powered Solutions Lightchain AI distinguishes itself by integrating artificial intelligence into decentralized applications, offering tools that go beyond entertainment and speculation. Its platform is designed to cater to industries like logistics, finance, and healthcare, enabling real-world applications that drive significant value. Through its collaborative ecosystem, Lightchain AI encourages developers to build on its platform, creating dApps that harness AI’s capabilities for predictive analytics, resource optimization, and decision-making. This approach ensures that dApp revenues are not only high but also sustainable, positioning Lightchain AI to surpass meme coin-driven revenues on platforms like Solana. Why Lightchain AI Is Poised to Surpass SHIB, DogWifHat, and Solana dApps Lightchain AI’s growth potential lies in its ability to offer practical, industry-focused solutions that extend beyond the speculative nature of meme coins. Its ongoing presale, which has raised over $5.7 million, reflects strong investor confidence in its vision. Unlike SHIB and DogWifHat, Lightchain AI’s scalability and developer-friendly tools create an ecosystem where meaningful applications thrive. By bridging AI with blockchain, the platform addresses gaps in efficiency, transparency, and data security, ensuring its relevance across multiple sectors. This unique positioning sets Lightchain AI on a path to dominate dApp revenues and reshape the blockchain landscape. Also, Lightchain AI’s commitment to sustainability and social responsibility further strengthens its appeal. With a focus on carbon neutrality, the project aligns with growing global concerns about blockchain's energy consumption, making it an attractive option for environmentally conscious investors. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

With this eight consecutive Monday purchase, the company’s stash has skyrocketed to over 446,000 BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired 2,138 BTC for ~$209 million at ~$97,837 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 47.8% QTD and 74.1% YTD. As of 12/29/2024, we hodl 446,400 $BTC acquired for ~$27.9 billion at ~$62,428 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/58aXM7g6u2 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 30, 2024 After the multi-billion dollar acquisitions announced in November and early December, MicroStrategy has slowed down on its BTC investments but still continues to allocate millions. The latest, announced by co-founder Michael Saylor earlier today, came at an average price of $97.834 per BTC. The firm has now spent just shy of $28 billion to accumulate its stash at an average price of $62,428. Although bitcoin’s price stands around 15% away from its all-time high registered last week, MicroStrategy’s holdings have a current value of $41.5 billion. This means that the firm now stands on an unrealized profit of more than $13 billion. As it happened with the last couple of purchases, though, Peter Schiff, the well-known BTC critic, was first to bash Saylor and the company he co-founded. The gold bug has repeatedly claimed that MicroStrategy’s purchases are the only thing that pushed BTC’s price north. He now said that this “smaller buy” with an average price above the current one cannot keep the asset rising. Once again you’ve announced a smaller buy at an average price that’s above the current price. You’re no longer buying enough Bitcoin to keep the price rising. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 30, 2024 It’s worth noting that BTC’s price has indeed tumbled in the past couple of weeks. It went from over $108,000 to its current level of $93,000, losing 15% in the process after the latest FOMC meeting for the year.

38307368,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634771,1735565567,Fed policies and election drama fail to hold back US economy in 2024,"The U.S. economy had every reason to crash this year. The Federal Reserve had interest rates at painful highs for most of the year, inflation refused to hit target levels, and a chaotic election season kept businesses and consumers on edge. Yet, somehow, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the U.S. will likely close the year as the top-performing economy among G7 countries. It wasn’t a perfect year by any stretch. But compared to the doom-and-gloom projections, the resilience was undeniable. So, what kept the economy moving when it should’ve stalled? Consumers kept the wheels turning The real MVP of 2024 was the American consumer. Wage growth outpaced inflation, giving households a bit more breathing room and total wealth hit record highs. These factors kept spending alive, with Bloomberg Economics estimating a 2.8% rise in household outlays—nearly double initial projections. Consumer spending literally was the lifeline of the economy this year. But here’s the thing, not everyone was spending from a position of strength. The pandemic-era savings cushion is gone for most households, and many are leaning on credit to maintain their lifestyles. Credit card balances soared, delinquency rates ticked up, and lower-income Americans bore the brunt of the strain. Meanwhile, the wealthier crowd—boosted by gains in stocks and housing—kept the spending numbers looking good. It’s a tale of two economies, wrapped up in one. The labor market, once the backbone of consumer confidence, also started to fray. Hiring slowed throughout the year, job openings shrank, and the unemployment rate edged higher. Workers who lost their jobs faced longer spells of unemployment, a classic recession red flag. Yet somehow, wages held steady, growing at about 4%—enough to keep the spending party alive… for now. Inflation wouldn’t budge, and the Fed stayed tough Inflation. The Fed’s favorite headache. After sharp drops in 2023 and early 2024, progress toward the magical 2% target stalled. By November, the Fed’s preferred metric—the core personal consumption expenditures price index—stood at 2.8%. Better than 2022’s numbers, but still not good enough for the central bank to feel comfortable. Jerome Powell and his crew slashed rates by a full percentage point in 2024, hoping to ease some of the pain on businesses and households. But he made it clear that until inflation shows real improvement, don’t expect any more cuts in 2025. Investors hated this. And so markets panicked, interpreting the central bank’s tone as a “hawkish pivot.” Stocks took a nosedive, and criticism of the Fed’s communication strategy hit a new peak. The disconnect between the Fed and the markets is glaring. If there was one place where the Fed’s policies hit hardest, it was housing. Mortgage rates dipped briefly to a two-year low in September but shot back up to nearly 7% as expectations for further rate cuts evaporated. Homebuilders, desperate to move inventory, pulled out all the stops—offering mortgage buydowns, covering closing costs, and even cutting prices outright. Did it work? Kind of. Sales stabilized but stayed far below pre-pandemic levels. The resale market, which dominates U.S. home purchases, hit rock bottom in 2024, the worst year since 1995. For many would-be buyers, the dream of homeownership remained just that—a dream. President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda added fuel to the fire. His promises to ramp up domestic manufacturing sounded good in theory, but the details—tariffs, mass deportations, and sweeping tax cuts—have caused fears of inflation, labor shortages, and supply chain chaos.

From Charles Gasparino's sharp critiques of the XRP community to Ripple CTO David Schwartz addressing misconceptions about his net worth, the debates surrounding the blockchain company reflect the complex dynamics of the crypto ecosystem. While XRP’s market performance and Ripple's ongoing legal battles with the SEC draw global attention, the personal narratives of its key figures add another layer to the unfolding story. Fox Business Reporter Charles Gasparino Intensifies Feud with the XRP Community Amid Ripple Lawsuit Controversy Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino has reignited tensions with the XRP community, delivering scathing remarks that have once again put him at odds with supporters of the cryptocurrency. Known for his provocative takes on financial matters, Gasparino recently dismissed the concept of an ”XRP army,” a term often used to describe the passionate and vocal supporters of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. In a move that angered the XRP faithful, Gasparino alleged that the community is primarily composed of individuals who ”bought the coin and made insiders rich.” His remarks come amidst lingering disputes between Ripple Labs, the blockchain company behind XRP, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Adding fuel to the fire, Gasparino also criticized the recent ruling by US District Judge Analisa Torres in the Ripple case, calling it ”dumb.” The Ripple case has been a focal point of debate in the cryptocurrency industry. While Judge Torres ruled that secondary sales of XRP are not securities, Gasparino has consistently questioned the implications of this decision. He has gone as far as to suggest that Ripple’s legal victory was overstated, asserting last November that the company ultimately ”lost” its battle with the SEC. In his latest commentary, Gasparino expressed skepticism that the departure of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler would lead to a change in the agency’s stance on Ripple. According to Gasparino’s sources, even under the leadership of libertarian Paul Atkins, who is poised to replace Gensler, the SEC is unlikely to abandon its long-standing case against Ripple. In an article for the New York Post, Gasparino detailed the challenges the cryptocurrency industry might face under Atkins’ tenure. While Atkins is viewed by some as more open to innovation in the financial sector, Gasparino suggests that his appointment does not guarantee leniency for Ripple or the broader crypto space. XRP’s Market Rollercoaster The XRP token experienced a significant rally in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven in part by optimism surrounding the legal battle and broader market sentiment. However, Gasparino downplayed the rally, asserting that only insiders truly benefited from the price surge. He also highlighted the token's inability to sustain its gains, noting that XRP has since surrendered a substantial portion of its value. This characterization of XRP’s performance has further angered its community, many of whom view Gasparino as an antagonist in the ongoing debate over Ripple’s future. The reporter has previously referred to the XRP community as a ”cult,” a remark that cemented his contentious relationship with its members. Gasparino’s critiques bring attention to broader concerns about the cryptocurrency industry's regulatory landscape. The SEC’s case against Ripple is one of the most closely watched legal battles in the sector, with significant implications for how digital assets are classified and regulated in the United States. If Gasparino’s predictions hold true and the SEC continues to pursue the case under Atkins, it could dampen investor sentiment and prolong the uncertainty surrounding XRP. The XRP community, however, remains steadfast in its belief that Ripple’s technology and the token’s use cases will prevail in the long term. The XRP community has responded to Gasparino’s latest remarks with characteristic fervor. Social media platforms have been inundated with posts defending the token and criticizing the reporter for his perceived bias against Ripple. Prominent members of the XRP community argue that Gasparino’s views do not reflect the broader adoption and innovation occurring within the Ripple ecosystem. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously criticized detractors like Gasparino for spreading misinformation, emphasizing that the company is committed to fighting for regulatory clarity and advancing the use of blockchain technology. Ripple CTO David Schwartz Denies Billionaire Status Amid XRP’s Resurgence Meanwhile, David Schwartz , the Chief Technology Officer at Ripple, has publicly refuted claims of being a billionaire, reigniting discussions about the financial windfalls of key figures in the cryptocurrency space. In a recent social media post, Schwartz denied crossing the billion-dollar mark, even as XRP, Ripple's associated cryptocurrency, remains in the spotlight following a major rally earlier this year. Ripple, headquartered in San Francisco, gained global attention during XRP's meteoric rise in 2018, when its top executives were listed among the world's wealthiest individuals. Co-founder Chris Larsen saw his net worth soar to an astonishing $54 billion during the rally, thanks largely to his allocation of 9 billion XRP tokens. Similarly, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reportedly amassed a fortune close to $10 billion at the cryptocurrency’s peak price. Schwartz, often dubbed Ripple's ”trillion-dollar man” by outlets like Forbes, followed a different path. Rather than accumulating XRP tokens, Schwartz opted for a 2% equity stake in Ripple and a salary. As of 2019, Forbes estimated his net worth at $90 million—a stark contrast to the fortunes of his colleagues. In 2021, Schwartz addressed his financial standing, stating that his net worth was ”a lot less than $170 million.” Reflecting on the volatility of his holdings, he remarked, ”Circumstance has forced me to have a lot of my net worth tied up in highly volatile assets. Obviously, I'm very happy with how it’s turned out, but always a bit on edge due to the risk.” Schwartz’s Cryptocurrency Portfolio Despite foregoing a significant XRP allocation early on, Schwartz remains an active participant in the cryptocurrency market. In 2020, he disclosed holding XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), and several other altcoins. However, his investments, tied to the unpredictable world of digital assets, have made his financial journey less stable than that of Ripple’s early investors. While Schwartz's conservative approach to Ripple's token distribution reflects his caution, it also places him outside the ranks of high-profile cryptocurrency billionaires such as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Earlier this year, XRP experienced a significant rally, briefly reclaiming its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This resurgence was driven by investor optimism surrounding Ripple's legal battle with the SEC. The case has had far-reaching implications for the classification of digital assets, making Ripple and XRP a central topic in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. During this rally, Chris Larsen reportedly added $6 billion to his net worth in a single month, solidifying his place among the elite in the crypto billionaire club. However, this wealth distribution among Ripple’s top brass has often sparked criticism within the cryptocurrency community, with some alleging that early insiders disproportionately benefitted from XRP’s success. Schwartz’s public denial of billionaire status sheds light on his measured approach to wealth accumulation and the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. His decision to prioritize equity in Ripple over a massive allocation of XRP tokens is a departure from the strategies of other Ripple executives who saw their fortunes balloon during XRP’s peaks. The CTO has often expressed caution regarding the risks of holding large amounts of volatile assets. In October 2021, Schwartz candidly acknowledged the tension between enjoying financial gains and managing the stress of market unpredictability. This transparency has earned him respect among industry peers and crypto enthusiasts alike, even as XRP continues to fuel debates about wealth distribution in the blockchain sector. As XRP remains a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, Ripple's leadership continues to face scrutiny over its financial strategies and the role of XRP in the company’s broader vision. Schwartz, with his pragmatic approach and technical expertise, has become a key figure in shaping Ripple's narrative amidst ongoing regulatory and market challenges. For now, the Ripple CTO’s wealth pales in comparison to the staggering fortunes of his colleagues, yet his influence in the cryptocurrency space remains undisputed. His financial decisions and public commentary offer a rare glimpse into the complexities of navigating personal wealth in an industry marked by rapid innovation and extreme volatility.",NEGATIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6743/charles-gasparino-escalates-feud-with-xrp-community-over-ripple-case,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Meanwhile, SC confirmed that the crypto company has complied with the directives. The regulator urged Malaysian investors to use licensed platforms to avoid financial crimes such as money laundering. The agency added, The public should alert the SC if they come across any suspicious websites or receive any unsolicited phone calls or emails offering unauthorized investment schemes, especially those that promise high returns with little or no risks. Bybit confirmed SC’s enforcement through the Malaysian Telegram group , stating that users should brace for possible conveniences.

Further, Bybit left France in August 2024 amid stiffer licensing requirements. Also, Tether has struggled over the past months amid increased delisting as firms prepared for MiCA.

The new policy requires stablecoin issuers to have specific certificates to operate in the EU region. Reports allege that Tether doesn’t satisfy the needed requirements. That has forced multiple European exchanges to delist Tether USDT, signaling the expected regulatory clampdown. In conclusion, the crypto space braces for significant shifts amid the evolving regulatory landscape. Trading firms continue to adjust their operations as Europe’s MiCA framework goes into effect. As regulatory developments unfold, staying updated remains crucial for investors.

38307139,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746904-fdig-cheap-but-too-much-coinbase?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1735565241,"FDIG: Cheap, But Too Much Coinbase","Summary The Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF is heavily correlated with Bitcoin and primarily invests in crypto-related stocks, including Coinbase and Bitcoin miners. Despite a bullish outlook on Bitcoin, I have concerns about FDIG's heavy exposure to Coinbase, which I currently don't favor. FDIG's price relative to Bitcoin is down 33% since July, making it cheap relative to Bitcoin, but key support levels must hold. Given the high correlation with Coinbase and my reservations about the stock, I rate FDIG a hold, suggesting better Bitcoin exposure alternatives. The explosion in the popularity of alt-coins such as OG Bitcoin has also given rise to numerous funds that seek to take advantage of mega-trends in the industry. One such fund is the Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF (FDIG). As the name implies, this ETF looks to capitalize on digital payments infrastructure, most of which is crypto-related. So while this isn't a pure Bitcoin fund, we'll call it Bitcoin-adjacent. While I don't love the current construction of the fund, given its correlation to Bitcoin itself, I cannot help but lean bullish longer-term. However, the current setup has too much exposure to a stock I don't particularly care for at the moment. Let's dig in. What is FDIG? The fund is a Fidelity-managed ETF that invests in stocks of companies that operate within information technology, software, IT services, data processing, payment processing, and crypto and blockchain technology. That opens the fund up to a variety of financial and adjacent stocks, but we'll see below it's extremely crypto-heavy. Seeking Alpha The fund's largest holding is Coinbase (COIN), followed by a slew of Bitcoin miners and a meaningful position in Block (SQ). These are all crypto stocks, so this is not a traditional payment processor/digital finance fund; it's a crypto fund. Obviously, there's nothing inherently wrong with that as Bitcoin has been an awesome place to be in 2024. Indeed, I remain bullish on Bitcoin for the foreseeable future, so I'm intrigued by anything that's related to what I see as the start of a big bull run in crypto. Indeed, all one needs to do is look at the 50-day correlation between FDIG and Bitcoin, which currently sits at 0.87. StockCharts While this relationship doesn't always hold, this kind of correlation means if you are bullish on Bitcoin, you pretty much have to be bullish on FDIG. They're moving in tandem, so you simply need to ask yourself if you think Bitcoin is a good place to be. FDIG is one way to take advantage of that if you are. So why did I say I don't love the current construction of the fund above, then? I'm not thrilled about the fund's largest position being Coinbase. StockCharts The correlation of FDIG to Coinbase is even higher at 0.96, meaning the fund and the stock are moving almost 1:1 with each other. If you like Coinbase, that's not an issue. I happen to think Coinbase is egregiously overpriced , and given it's by far the largest holding of FDIG, that concerns me. Let's take a look at the charts to further the discussion. Will support hold? That's the key question right now as FDIG tests key support after the recent drawdown. StockCharts Shares are testing the low-$30s, which is below both of the major moving averages. That's not a good start, as that's the best way to identify if an asset is in a primary uptrend or not, and FDIG isn't any longer. However, all is not lost so long as the area between $32 and $34 holds, which I've highlighted above. The RSI is holding 40, which is a good sign for the bulls, as is the PPO turning higher at the centerline. If those indicators go below those respective levels, that's a warning sign that this is morphing into something worse. But for now, it looks okay. If we highlight just the relationship between FDIG and Bitcoin, this is where things get pretty interesting. StockCharts This chart just shows the price of FDIG to the price of Bitcoin as a valuation measure of the fund. Since the high at $35 in July - which is almost exactly the same price as we have today for FDIG - its value relative to Bitcoin is down 33% . That means Bitcoin has rallied hard, while FDIG just hasn't. That means the fund is very cheap relative to Bitcoin, so that lessens the risk of buying today if you're so inclined. Turning to the weekly chart, we have more support for the bulls. StockCharts A large ascending triangle formation was broken out of back in November, and we're retesting that level today. That also happens to correspond to the rising 20-week exponential moving average, so again, there's plenty of reason for the bulls to step in here. With ascending triangles, we generally see some sort of test of the breakout area, and that's exactly what we're getting. The key is that the bulls need to show up very soon to avoid this pattern being invalidated. Watch the levels on the daily chart to make sure key support isn't violated. One final note on the charts is that we'd be remiss if we didn't look at Coinbase, given the almost perfect correlation between FDIG and that stock. StockCharts While I don't see the fundamental case for Coinbase at $265, we have to respect the charts. Unsurprisingly, this chart looks very similar to FDIG's chart, so a lot of the same commentary applies. We have a PPO centerline test, a 40 RSI test, and key support. The triple top that was put in earlier this year at $265/$270 is the key level to watch, and Coinbase is precariously perched there today. Unless and until the relationship between FDIG and Coinbase breaks down, you can watch the action in Coinbase to understand where FDIG is going. So what to do, then? I want to be clear that I'm bullish on Bitcoin, and therefore, I lean bullish on FDIG. However, I really don't like Coinbase here, and the fact is that Coinbase is nearly perfectly correlated to FDIG. With that in mind, I'm initiating FDIG at a hold rating. I think there are better ways to own Bitcoin exposure than FDIG, including simply buying the coin itself or a fund that does so for you. If FDIG had less exposure to Coinbase, I'd rate it a buy, but for now, I think it's a less optimal way to gain Bitcoin exposure.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746904-fdig-cheap-but-too-much-coinbase?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/38307139.jpeg

If the possible bearish scenarios can be avoided, the altcoins can start to rise. Solana ($SOL) is primed to lead this next potential surge. Solana ($SOL) in best position to lead the field Bitcoin ($BTC) has reached a pivotal moment, and the next move could either lead to new all-time highs, a prolongation of the current sideways trajectory, or a dip that could even take the price back down to $73,000. With most short-term Stochastic RSIs near, or at the bottom, an upturn of these indicators can certainly provide the required upside momentum. Among all the bigger altcoins by market cap, $SOL is possibly in the best position to lead the rest of the field out of the current downturn. With most transactions now taking place on the Solana blockchain, and the full implementation of the ground-breaking Firedancer validator client still to come, the $SOL price could be about to reverse its current correction and move a lot higher. Bitcoin Dominance breaking down Source: TradingView First of all, when coming to a decision on whether the altcoins can make some headway, it is important to look at the Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D). This is showing that the price is starting to consolidate below the ascending wedge. If this continues, and dominance makes a lower low, the uptrend can be broken. $SOL on the way to a trend break Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $SOL shows how the price had been making lower highs and lows. Even the major support at $202 was broken, and it wasn’t until the price hit the next major support at $174 that the bulls were able to turn things around. That said, they still have a way to go. The next descending trendline needs to be broken to the upside, and it’s only if $SOL gets back above $202, flipping it once more into support, that the downtrend can be reversed. Why $SOL can lead the next altcoin surge Source: TradingView Nevertheless, it’s on the weekly chart where the possibilities for $SOL can be fully understood. Staying above the trendline, and breaking the $202 resistance level is paramount, but it’s at the bottom of the chart from where bulls can take their inspiration. The indicators on the weekly Stochastic RSI are almost at the bottom. This is a more advanced state than for any other major altcoins, and is the reason why $SOL can rise first, as the full thrust of momentum gets under the price and forces it higher. There is still some way to go, but it looks like the indicator lines should bottom by the end of this week, and the first angling upward could even take place the following week. $SOL has also recently bounced from the bottom of a bull flag, plus from major support, for its $BTC pair (SOL/BTC). If $SOL can go on to break through the top of this bull flag, there won’t be much that can stop the $SOL price from rocketing over the final stage of the bull market.

As a result, the start of 2025 may not be progressive, as the market participants continue to remain uncertain over the next price action. Therefore, the lower targets below $90,000 remain active as the BTC price rally continues to flash the possibility of a continued descending trend. After failing to sustain above $100K, the bulls failed to elevate the levels back above the range. Besides, the crypto reading volume has also dropped, suggesting the bulls remain passive, waiting for a good entry point. The price is again trying to trigger a healthy rebound from the levels it has been defending for over a week. However, the participation of the bulls and the bears has dropped to a large extent, suggesting a sluggish close for the year. Meanwhile, a 5% drop may attract the required liquidity onto the platform, which could attract more bulls. Market Sentiment Points to Lower Targets Below $90K for BTC The Bitcoin price continues to flash bearish signals as the RSI ( Relative Strength Index ) remains decremental and is heading towards the lower threshold. Currently, the price is holding the interim support at $93,600 while facing massive upward pressure. This suggests the price could fail to defend the support that may lead the price to drop below $90,000. On the other hand, MACD ( Moving Average Convergence Divergence ) suggests a rise and drop in the selling pressure at frequent intervals, indicating the bears have a strong grip over the rally. Bears Maintain Control as Bitcoin Struggles to Defend Key Support Levels Therefore, the scenario over the Bitcoin price remains the same, as the token may witness more downward momentum pre-Trump and return upwards from there. Hence, the ideal scenario could be a plunge below $90,000 as the fear within the future markets and a shift towards altcoins are dampening Bitcoin bullish momentum. Therefore, $90,000 or levels slightly below could be the perfect spot to bid before the next leg up. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Join the Feline Frenzy! $CATZILLA Is on the Rise—Claim Your Share Today! VeChain Eyes Potential Upswing Amid Positive Market Signals VeChain (VET) has been on an upward trajectory, gaining over 75% in the past 6 months. The coin's price is currently consolidating between $0.0352 and $0.0587, hovering near its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages. Technical indicators like the RSI at 54.53 and a positive MACD suggest bullish momentum. If VET breaks through the nearest resistance at $0.0717, it could target the next level at $0.0951, representing potential gains. However, if it fails to surpass resistance, it may retrace towards the support at $0.0248. Pyth Network (PYTH) Poised for Breakout as Bull Run Looms Pyth Network (PYTH) is gaining attention as its price moves between $0.14 and $0.54. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are nearly identical at $0.39 and $0.38, reflecting steady growth. A positive MACD level of 0.0050 points to increasing bullish momentum. The nearest resistance is at $0.72, and breaking this level could propel the price upward. Should PYTH reach the second resistance at $1, it would represent significant gains from its current range. With the upcoming altcoin season and a global crypto bull run anticipated, PYTH has the potential to rise substantially, possibly exceeding a 30% increase if it surpasses key resistance levels. Aptos (APT) Set to Break $16 Resistance Amid Bullish Indicators Aptos (APT) is showing strong signs of a potential breakout. Despite a 1-month decline of 28.44%, its 6-month price change is a positive 29.91%. The Relative Strength Index is at 58.37, indicating bullish momentum. The price is hovering around both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $9.15 and $9.14, respectively. If APT breaks through the nearest resistance level at $16, it could surge toward the next resistance at $22, which would be a substantial increase from current levels. The MACD level of 0.0735 and a Stochastic of 67.97 further support the potential for upward movement. Aptos may be gearing up for significant growth in the upcoming altcoin season. Jupiter (JUP) Eyes Breakout as Altcoin Season Nears Jupiter (JUP) is trading between $0.66 and $1.05, showing signs of upward momentum. The MACD level is positive at 0.0037, indicating a potential rise. The RSI is neutral at 52.69, suggesting room for growth. The nearest resistance is at $1.28; if JUP breaks this level, it could climb toward the next resistance at $1.67. This would represent an increase of over 50% from the current price range. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are close at $0.84 and $0.85, hinting at a consolidation phase before a possible breakout. With a 1.74% gain over the past week, Jupiter may be gearing up for a strong move as altcoin season approaches. Conclusion VET, PYTH, APT, and JUP show less short-term potential. In contrast, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero, aiming for financial freedom for all. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale—from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages—and triple utility in governance, incentives, and staking, Catzilla offers a unique opportunity to join the fight against crypto villains.

Christian Lindner, who recently criticized German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for not including Bitcoin in Germany’s financial strategy, said that the European Central Bank and the German Federal Bank (Bundesbank) should review their reserve policies. Lindner stated that the ECB and the Bundesbank should consider cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to strengthen their reserve policies. According to Lindner, the Bundesbank and the ECB need cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as well as gold and foreign currencies. Speaking to the German press, Lindner said: “The new Trump administration is pursuing a very progressive policy when it comes to crypto assets like Bitcoin. Because the US wants to be the world's leading location in crypto as well as the dollar. At this point, the US Federal Reserve is even considering including cryptocurrencies in its reserves, along with currencies and gold. “While the US is making progress on crypto, Germany and Europe must not allow themselves to fall behind the US once again. Germany also needs to examine whether cryptocurrencies should be included in the central bank's reserves, because cryptocurrencies now constitute a significant portion of global wealth growth.” As you may recall, in December, French MP Sarah Knafo also called for a strategic BTC reserve for the European Union. Related News: A Member of Parliament Cites El Salvador and the US as Examples, Calls for a Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve for the European Union! When asked about the huge fluctuations in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices and the risks of this, Lindner said that these concerns are known to everyone and continued as follows: “No one would bet everything on them without question. However, political risks can be calculated due to a decentralized system where no one has sole power. There are also fluctuations in classic assets such as gold, which are precious metals.” *This is not investment advice.

Catwifhat ($CWIF): A Deflationary Meme Coin on the Solana Blockchain Catwifhat ($CWIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, introduced in December 2023. It brings deflationary token economics to memecoins through an auto-burn feature. This mechanism applies a 4% burn fee to every on-chain transaction, including buys, sells, and wallet transfers. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana that increase their supply to reward network participants, $CWIF reduces its supply as more transactions occur. Since all contract authorities were revoked on the first day, the burn mechanism is permanent and unchangeable. This unique approach may make $CWIF attractive in the current market cycle, offering potential value through continuous scarcity. Chill Guy: The Relaxed Meme Promoting Mindfulness and Its Potential Coin Chill Guy is a new meme character known for his relaxed and carefree attitude. Depicted wearing a grey sweater, blue jeans, and red shoes, he smirks with his hands in his pockets, embodying a laid-back and ""lowkey"" vibe. Popular on TikTok and other platforms, he resonates with people seeking calm in a hectic world. The Chill Guy movement aims to spread mindfulness and inner peace, encouraging individuals to embrace taking life easy. There's a potential coin associated with this movement, leveraging technology to promote its message. In the current market cycle, the coin may appear attractive due to its connection with a trending meme and the growing interest in mental well-being initiatives. Shiro Neko ($SHIRO): Embarking on a Blockchain Journey with the White Cat Shiro Neko ($SHIRO) is a memecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Named ""White Cat"" in Japanese, it seeks to create a fun and engaging ecosystem where every holder is part of the community.

This Altcoin Could Deliver 100x Returns in 2025,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with opportunities, but 2023 was dominated by Solana (SOL) and XRP, both delivering remarkable gains. However, as their growth begins to plateau, all eyes are on Lightchain AI (LCAI), a revolutionary token in its presale stage priced at $0.0041. With predictions of 100x returns by 2025, Lightchain AI is becoming a hot topic among investors seeking to capitalize on innovative blockchain advancements. Solana and XRP set the stage for success but their momentum is slowing Solana and XRP have made their own spots in the crypto world. Solana’s power comes from its fast deals and cheap fees, which makes it a top choice for creators of NFTs and DeFi sites. XRP, however, leads the area of cross-border payments with Ripple’s ties to banks across the globe. Even with their solid basics, the chance for these coins to grow is leveling off. Solana has tough rivalry from other Layer-1 nets and XRP’s action sticks to current law changes. As these coins get older, backers are searching for fres͏h chances with hidden growth options like Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI combines cutting-edge AI integration with blockchain scalability Lightchain AI offers a fresh perspective on blockchain utility by focusing on decentralized AI applications. The platform’s ability to execute AI workloads directly on the blockchain gives it a competitive edge over traditional tokens. Its Distributed Intelligence Processing Network ensures that AI computations are allocated efficiently, boosting both scalability and performance. This innovative feature is particularly appealing to industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance, which require real-time data processing. By providing a secure and scalable infrastructure for AI-driven solutions, Lightchain AI is set to capture a significant share of the growing AI market. Investors are drawn to Lightchain AI’s growth potential and early-stage price advantage Lightchain AI’s presale success, with over $5.7 million raised, reflects strong market confidence in its vision. Early investors are particularly attracted to its low entry price of $0.0041, which offers significant upside as the token gains traction. Unlike Solana and XRP, which have already achieved widespread adoption, z is still in its early stages, offering room for exponential growth. Its focus on real-world applications and enterprise solutions makes it a standout in the cryptocurrency landscape, especially for those seeking long-term investment opportunities. And with analysts predicting a 100x return by 2025, Lightchain AI is poised to deliver significant gains for investors willing to take the leap. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

38306649,https://coinpaper.com/6745/germany-s-push-for-bitcoin-as-a-federal-reserve-asset-may-fuel-growth-beyond-150k,1735564281,Germany’s Push For Bitcoin As A Federal Reserve Asset May Fuel Growth Beyond $150k,"The idea of Bitcoin becoming a reserve asset is gaining traction, with political forces on both sides of the Atlantic advocating for the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in federal finances. If the concept takes off, it could provide Bitcoin with unprecedented institutional credibility, possibly driving the asset’s price toward $150,000 or higher. After gaining momentum in the US, the proposal has sparked debate in Europe, particularly in Germany, the continent’s strongest economy. Christian Lindner: we need to accept Bitcoin or risk getting left behind In a recent statement for the dpa press agency, Christian Lindner, the leader of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and a former German Finance Minister, suggested that both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bundesbank should consider including cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, in their financial reserves. Lindner pointed to the US, where cryptocurrencies are being discussed as a potential reserve asset on par with national currencies and gold. – The new Trump administration is pursuing an extremely progressive policy when it comes to crypto assets such as Bitcoin – he said, stressing that the US wants to become a global leader in the crypto sector. The politician also warned that ignoring the issue entails the risk of being left behind for Germany and Europe. German liberals suggest Bitcoin could be a reserve currency It’s not a one-off publicity move. Lindner’s home party has recently published a manifesto for the coming 2025 election, in which it demonstrates strong support for crypto assets. FDP’s election program goes as far as to recommend the inclusion of Bitcoin and other blockchain currencies in the ECB’s and Bundesbank’s reserves. “We welcome and advocate the development of cryptocurrencies and digital ledger technology for the approval of crypto ETFs. We are open to the European Central Bank and the Deutsche Bundesbank using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as currency reserves. This can strengthen the resilience of the European monetary system,” the document states. The manifesto goes on to address cash and the use of the CBDC (the digital euro). “We Free Democrats stand for maintaining cash. We are in favor of broad acceptance of cash alongside card payments. A digital euro that complements cash must protect user privacy and be usable both online and offline. There may be no compulsion to use the digital euro and there must be no additional risks for the financial system,” the program states. Bitcoin has the full support of Donald Trump The Bitcoin-as-a-federal-reserve idea has been vividly discussed in the US. Its most notable proponent has been no other than Donald Trump, who suggested stockpiling crypto as strategic assets. On December 12, the president-elect said, “We’re gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else (...), but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead.” After converting from crypto skepticism, Trump has consistently advocated for Bitcoin as a strategic asset, vowing to push the US ahead of key competitors in the crypto race. A rumor has it that an executive order could officially designate Bitcoin as a reserve asset soon after Trump assumes office on January 20, 2025. The US government currently holds 212,847 BTC, worth $22.3 billion, seized through law enforcement actions. However, it’s uncertain whether Trump’s proposed reserve would include these holdings. That said, it’s too early to make any definitive conclusions. Especially since there’s little support for the idea from the Federal Reserve. FED doesn’t support the concept but it’ll be up to Congress to decide The institution’s chairman, Jerome Powell, recently declared that the US central bank is not involved in any government effort to stockpile large amounts of Bitcoin. He added though, that it’d be up to Congress to consider such an issue, leaving open the possibility of a shift in policy. It’s worth emphasizing that the idea has been floated repeatedly in various forums and top political circles. Growing support for crypto and related solutions among businesses and individuals is another factor making the concept harder to dismiss. If the proposal eventually moves forward, providing Bitcoin – and potentially selected altcoins – with the highest level of institutional legitimacy, we could be seeing the BTC price soar toward $150k and even beyond. The bull case scenario suggests the top cryptocurrency could even reach $400k next year",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | ASIA | BTC | FIAT | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6745/germany-s-push-for-bitcoin-as-a-federal-reserve-asset-may-fuel-growth-beyond-150k,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
38306646,https://crypto.news/?p=14323023,1735564260,2024’s loyalty overhaul: Blockchain’s promise for brands | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. To succeed in web3, brands need to understand that the future of loyalty isn’t about locking customers into closed systems. It’s about setting them free—free to own their data, control their rewards, and engage with brands on their own terms. Loyalty programs have never been more popular, but they’ve also never felt so outdated. As the inflation crisis eases, customers continue to trade personal details for deals—gaining access to ‘normal’ prices while non-members pay a premium. You might also like: The illusion of web3 innovation in large consumer brands | Opinion This tactic, although counterintuitive, is working. According to Antavo’s 2023 Global Customer Loyalty Report , 67.7% of businesses have made plans to boost investment into loyalty programs to retain customers in the face of inflation. And 79% of American consumers have taken the bait, spending more with brands that offer loyalty perks, reports Statista. Yet, this scramble to boost loyalty has revealed that traditional loyalty programs are losing relevance. But there is a solution on the horizon. Blockchain technology has emerged as a potentially radical alternative to the tried and no longer true loyalty programs that many brands still hold onto. Walled gardens and limited use cases Anecdotally, traditional loyalty programs have operated within walled gardens where customer data is siloed, and rewards are limited to specific use cases. These models have long depended on third-party cookies and opaque data practices to thrive. However, as privacy regulations tighten and cookies phase-out, these models are rapidly losing their viability. The result? Loyalty inefficiency through unused points, shallow engagement, and fragmented data. Additionally, thanks to data breaches becoming garden variety, consumers are increasingly erring on the side of caution over how their data is collected and used, with many opting out of loyalty programs altogether. In the digital era, traditional loyalty frameworks have begun to crumble. Nowadays, customers don’t have to settle for being trapped in closed systems, and brands can no longer take customer buy-in for granted. Instead, brands need to make a compelling case for why sharing personal information is worth a customer’s engagement. This is where the blockchain comes into play. Because if traditional loyalty programs are like store gift cards that can only be used in one place, blockchain-based loyalty is like cash: fungible and usable almost anywhere without revealing a customer’s identity. Within this framework, smart contracts ensure transparency, while user-owned wallets put control back in the hands of consumers, redefining the value exchange between brands and their patrons. Revamping loyalty one block at a time Imagine a loyalty program that runs seamlessly in the background, powered by blockchain but invisible to the user. Shoppers earn tokens for purchases and interactions, redeemable for discounts, experiences, or even tradable with others. Unlike traditional points, these tokens belong entirely to the consumer and are securely stored in a digital wallet. Dynamic NFTs offer a glimpse into the future of onchain loyalty. These customizable, tokenized assets evolve with user engagement—think NFT badges that unlock exclusive products or perks, like Lululemon rewards earning you a free month of personal training at your gym. These dynamic tokens can be tailored to a customer’s experience. By leveraging AI, brands can add security measures like verifiable credentials into the mix to help create personalized experiences. Now with verifiable credentials in this framework, users can share only the information they choose to, while brands can use modular tools onchain to build custom loyalty experiences tailored to individual preferences. The result is a loyalty program that feels less intrusive, more authentic, and more engaging than traditional means. Although we’re still incredibly early to these potential benefits, the idea of tech abstraction has been a major driving force behind this paradigm. Some have even likened this evolution to the rise of cloud computing (like Amazon Web Services), where consumers don’t see the tech they’re interacting with, just the optimal user experience that it creates. Opting-in to the future of loyalty As cookies disappear and privacy concerns about data grow, an increasing number of brands are now asking themselves a critical question: “How can we make loyalty programs so compelling that users actively choose to participate?” The answer lies in creating experiences that are genuinely valuable to customers. Gone are the days of buy 10 get 1 free. These traditional incentives (which really don’t feel like incentives anymore) can now be replaced by onchain rewards like collectibles, leaderboards, or token-gated experiences. Brands must still tread carefully when entering this new paradigm. Shallow attempts to bring products on-chain have failed spectacularly on web3. After years of refinement, the general consensus is that simply tokenizing existing loyalty programs without rethinking value propositions is a recipe for experiences to fall flat. As blockchain technology matures, brands embracing this paradigm will thrive, unlocking transformative rewards not only for their customers but for themselves along the way.

Two of the most influential players in the crypto market, Ethereum ( ETH) and Solana (SOL), the billionaire, have specially chosen to avoid. This calculated turn begs issues regarding the underlying potential of Rexas Finance and its special value offer. Ethereum’s Challenges: Growth Amid Competition Ethereum has had a wild year. It is often called the backbone of distributed finance (DeFi) and smart contract development. As of December 24, 2024, ETH was trading at over $3,451.48, a small rise of 2.38% from its previous closing. Although Ethereum is still a pillar of blockchain technology, its success has lagged behind other top cryptocurrencies. Following testing the $3,425.50 resistance, Ethereum has battled to recover its $3,540 support level. Should Ethereum fail to bounce back, analysts warn of a possible slump to $3,027. Although Ethereum has climbed just 6.9% year-to-date, behind Bitcoin's 37.5% and Solana's 25% increases, its recent push beyond $4,000 was a noteworthy highlight. Ethereum's cost-effectiveness and scalability present ongoing difficulties. Even with the switch to Ethereum 2.0 and a proof-of-stake consensus method, faster and less expensive substitutes erode Ethereum's hegemony. Investors—including the crypto billionaire—have been driven by this competitive pressure to hunt prospects elsewhere. Solana (SOL): A Rising Star with Regulatory Setbacks Solana has attracted much interest because of its low cost and fast transactions. At $195.98 right now, Solana's value has increased by 1.57%. However, the token's performance has been erratic, showing uncertainty in its market future; it has dropped sharply 23% weekly. Though Solana's short-term forecasts show it reaching $198.50, experts are also cautious about possible declines to $173.42. Complicating Solana's perspective even more are regulatory obstacles. The recent rejection of registrations for Solana-based ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has eroded investor confidence and sparked concerns regarding the network's capacity to draw institutional capital. Some investors—including the crypto billionaire—have been driven by these difficulties to investigate substitutes with stability, innovation, and growth potential, which raises the profile of Rexas Finance. Why Rexas Finance (RXS) Stands Out Among the difficulties Ethereum and Solana present, Rexas Finance has become a rather interesting substitute. Significant investor interest is drawn to the platform's creative approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing. Rexas Finance is creating a niche by allowing the tokenization of tangible assets, including real estate, intellectual property, and commodities, unlike Ethereum and Solana, which concentrate mostly on distributed apps and fast transactions. This special value proposition targets a multi-trillion-dollar market and provides a fresh degree of liquidity and accessibility for usually illiquid assets. Simplifying asset tokenization helps Rexas Finance democratize access to investment possibilities and promote world financial inclusion. The rising popularity of Rexas Finance has been much driven by its presale. Rising from $0.03 in its early stages to $0.175, the token has already seen 483% price growth, raising over $33,458,073 across 11 stages. Investor interest keeps exploding, with 381,861,525 tokens sold out of the 425,000,000 allotted for the presale. This outstanding achievement emphasizes the increasing faith in Rexas Finance's capacity to keep its word. Early investors should expect a 30,000% increase by 2025; hence, the token is among the most interesting prospects available in the cryptocurrency market. Beyond its technological and financial advances, Rexas Finance has prioritized developing a strong and involved community. With over 650,000 entries thus far, projects like the $1 million RXS token giveaway have drawn much interest. This campaign builds the project's user base and honors early adopters. The platform’s dedication to security is another significant component of its appeal. Rexas Finance has undergone a full Certik audit, which has increased investor trust in its smart contracts and overall infrastructure. This focus on transparency and reliability sets it apart from many other new projects in the blockchain arena. The Future of Rexas Finance Rexas Finance is attracting investors looking for high-growth prospects in the crypto space as Ethereum and Solana are being examined more and encountering problems. Through asset tokenization, RXS is closing a significant gap that more established projects have mostly missed by addressing actual demands. Rexas Finance is positioned to participate significantly in the blockchain market with a successful presale performance, a developing community, and a clear vision. As a transforming factor in digital banking, RXS presents a strong argument for investors wishing to seize the next great opportunity.

38306763,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634764,1735564164,"The Cold War of National Bitcoin Reserve: Japan, Russia, USA, Hong Kong, Germany, and El Salvador voice their stances","The race to establish national Bitcoin reserves is reshaping geopolitical strategies as nations around the world seek to position themselves as global financial leaders. The most prominent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has become a cornerstone in this “Cold War for crypto reserves,” with major powers such as the United States, Russia, China, Japan, and others seeking to come out on top. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, more than 10 countries have known BTC holdings. Unverified reports put the United Arab Emirates at the top of the pile, with over 420,000 BTC in its portfolio. However, the United States is the current confirmed largest Bitcoin holder, with approximately 198,109 BTC, valued at over $18 billion at current market prices. The country’s holdings were supposedly accumulated through asset seizures from criminal investigations such as the Silk Road case. China is second on the list, followed by the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Bhutan, El Salvador, and Venezuela. The United States aims to be a global Bitcoin headquarter In a move to further strengthen its position as the global leader in crypto adoption, US lawmakers, including Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, introduced a proposal to acquire more BTC. Lummis’s bill, known as the “Bitcoin Act,” proposes that the US acquire up to 200,000 BTC annually over the next five years, aiming for a total of 5% of the cryptocurrency’s global supply. President-elect Donald Trump adopted this push for a strategic reserve. At the BTC 2024 conference in Nashville, Trump endorsed the creation of a “strategic Bitcoin stockpile,” affirming that his administration would keep all Bitcoin held by the US government indefinitely. Equity fund manager Grant Cardone, known for managing $4.5 billion in assets, has expressed strong support for Trump’s BTC reserve initiative. Drawing a parallel to President John F. Kennedy’s space program, Cardone believes that such a move could solidify the US’s dominance in the global financial system. Donald Trump will propose putting BTC on the our balance sheet in an”huge” way. USA is in a world race for monetary domination. and Trump will sell the American people that BTC is VITAL to our continued leadership role in the world, like Kennedy did when he sold USA on being… — Grant Cardone (@GrantCardone) December 26, 2024 Cardone also highlighted the growing movement among BRICS nations to de-dollarize their economies. He said, “Trump will sell the American people that BTC is VITAL to our continued leadership role in the world.” However, Fed chair Jerome Powell disputed the idea, saying that the Central Bank can’t hold BTC and that matters involving digital currency should be discussed by Congress, not the Federal Reserve. Japan and Russia hold back While the US is planning to push ahead with its BTC strategy, Japan and Russia, who initially hinted at creating a BTC reserve, are backing away. A recent proposal by Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada suggested that Japan follow the US’ example and convert part of its foreign exchange reserves into BTC. However, Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s office stated that the government does not yet have a full understanding of BTC’s potential or the developments in the US and other countries. As such, Japan’s stance remains non-committal, with further exploration of the idea expected in the future. Similarly, Russia has ruled out the idea of creating a BTC reserve in the near term. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has stated that while Russia may consider the possibility in the future, the volatility of BTC makes it a risky asset for national reserves. Despite this caution, Russia’s interest in BTC has grown, especially since the imposition of Western sanctions. Reports indicate that state-controlled entities and oligarchs have been increasingly using BTC, signaling a shift toward decentralized finance. The Russian government has also passed legislation legalizing crypto mining and facilitating the use of digital assets for international payments, paving the way for potential future moves toward a national BTC reserve. China’s strategic holdings China, the second-largest government holder of Bitcoin, has amassed an estimated 190,000 to 194,000 BTC, primarily through seizures linked to illegal activities, most notably the PlusToken Ponzi scheme. While China has not yet formally embraced Bitcoin as part of its national reserve strategy, the scale of its holdings is noteworthy. In Hong Kong, Wu Jiexhuang, a member of the Legislative Council, has proposed that the region consider including Bitcoin in its financial reserves. Jiexhuang pointed to relatively smaller nations, such as El Salvador, which have already integrated BTC into their strategic reserves, as well as US states that have taken similar steps. He noted that Trump’s push to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset could have significant implications for global financial markets, urging Hong Kong to study the potential impacts of US-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Germany and the Bitcoin debate In Europe, discussions are also underway about BTC’s potential role in national and regional reserves. Christian Lindner, former German finance minister, has called on the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bundesbank to consider adding Bitcoin to their reserves. Lindner argued that Germany and Europe cannot afford to fall behind in the growing global conversation about cryptocurrencies. He proposed that crypto assets, alongside traditional reserves like gold and foreign currencies, could help strengthen Europe’s financial resilience. While the ECB and Bundesbank have not yet made a definitive move, Lindner’s remarks underscore the rising interest in Bitcoin within Europe, especially as the US leads the way in adopting it as a reserve asset. El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserve milestone El Salvador is among the most proactive nations in adopting Bitcoin. The country has now accumulated over 6,000 BTC, placing it sixth among the largest government holders of Bitcoin globally. El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserves, valued at approximately $570 million, have grown significantly as the price of Bitcoin surged from $45,000 to over $100,000 recently. CRIME HAS FLATLINED IN EL SALVADOR. Why? 1. God 2. Determination 3. Ignoring the naysayers We applied the exact same principles to our Bitcoin strategy, and it paid off, big time. Now, we’re taking the same approach with our deal with the IMF. To succeed, we need the same… https://t.co/wCBxoZfkC7 — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) December 19, 2024 The country’s consistent strategy of purchasing one Bitcoin per day has proven successful, with the nation recently making larger-than-usual purchases to further expand its holdings. El Salvador’s President, Nayib Bukele, has celebrated the country’s Bitcoin reserves, noting that their value has increased by 127% since the country’s initial investments. If nations continue accumulating Bitcoin reserves, it could signal the rise of digital gold, replacing traditional assets in national treasuries. Bitcoin’s decentralization, limited supply, and resistance to inflation challenge the dominance of fiat currencies like the US dollar and Chinese yen. Crypto could reshape global finance and influence the way countries store wealth.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum maintain their dominance, altcoins like Solana, Toncoin, and Cardano are gaining traction, showcasing innovative technologies and growing ecosystems. There is growing speculation that alternative cryptocurrencies might challenge Bitcoin's dominance. With new technologies and innovations, altcoins are gaining traction among investors and users. The question arises: Could this be the year when altcoins outshine the original digital currency? According to ChangeNOW, a platform used by savvy investors and whales who are worried about the safety of their funds, transaction volumes in these coins increased. Bitcoin: The Digital Gold That's Changing the Game Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. It was created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin allows people to send money directly to each other without needing a bank. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin exists on a network of computers all around the world. These computers work together to keep track of all the transactions. This system is called a blockchain. Miners are the people who help verify transactions by solving complex puzzles. For their work, they earn bitcoins. Every four years or so, the amount of bitcoins miners receive is cut in half in an event called the ""halving."" This process helps control the supply and can affect how valuable Bitcoin is. Bitcoin continues to show potential in the market. Its technology aims to make transactions secure and free from fraud. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains a leader because of its widespread acceptance and proven track record. Market trends suggest that Bitcoin is still an attractive option for both new and experienced users.

The cryptocurrency spent most of the weekend hovering just above $95,000. However, it dipped significantly late on Sunday night and by early Monday morning had dipped to a low of $92,942 before recovering to its current level of $93,690, down almost 1.50% over the past 24 hours. Several other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) , and Solana (SOL), registered notable losses. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Toncoin (TON), Cardano (ADA) , Polkadot (DOT), Stellar (XLM) , and Litecoin (LTC) also recorded substantial losses. What To Expect In 2025 Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market have capped a hugely successful 2024, with analysts, traders, and institutions optimistic about 2025 and further price increases. BTC saw a considerable rally at the beginning of the year following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which sparked interest in the asset. This was followed by the Bitcoin halving event, slashing the number of BTC awarded to miners, creating an imbalance between demand and supply, sending the price higher. Donald Trump’s victory in November acted as the catalyst needed for BTC to cross the $100,000 mark for the first time. Trump’s victory is being seen as a game-changing development for the crypto industry, with the President-elect making several promises on the campaign trail, including creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Trump has also nominated Paul Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly views, as SEC Chair. However, markets have adopted a wait-and-watch stance. Delphi Ventures General Counsel Sarag Brennan stated, “Trump’s stance on [decentralized finance (DeFi)] and crypto has been somewhat inconsistent. While he has expressed interest in the space, much of his focus seems limited to supporting dollar dominance and real estate applications.” Now, let’s talk about BTC. Analysts expect the world’s largest cryptocurrency to reach $200,000, while VanEck has taken a slightly conservative stance, predicting it will reach $180,000. While such predictions have been made in the past, BTC’s jump above $100,000 shows nothing is out of reach for the asset. With the asset approaching its 21 million limit, demand is picking up and will send its price surging. Some economists and analysts have called BTC’s current price action a “supercycle.” However, the Federal Reserve could crash the BTC party after significantly scaling back rate cuts for 2025 and going on record to state it is not allowed to hold BTC. But will BTC’s rally spill over to altcoins? Analysts and market watchers expect friendlier regulations. This is why many institutions have already sent applications for ETFs related to major altcoins like XRP, indicating the market is ready to shift beyond BTC and ETH. VC Funding To Be Stronger In 2025 According to PitchBook analyst Robert Le, VC funding will be significantly stronger in 2025 compared to 2024. According to Le, 2023 was a challenging year for crypto funding due to several market factors, including the collapse of FTX, which led to an erosion of trust and higher interest rates. However, 2024 started positively, with markets picking up momentum following the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. “We’re going to see $18 billion or more in venture capital dollars that’s going to be invested into crypto. That’s a 50% increase from 2024 but still less than the roughly $30 billion “that was invested in 2021 and 2022.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has seen quite a slump since it hit its new all-time high of $108,268. Since then, BTC has slipped below $100,000 and has struggled to regain momentum and resume its upward trajectory. BTC has failed to reclaim the $100,000, going below it on Thursday (December 19). Sellers dragged the price lower on Friday as it dipped to an intraday low of $92,072. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $98,124. Buyers attempted a recovery on Saturday as the price rose to an intraday high of $99,942. However, BTC lost momentum at this level and dropped by 0.63% to $97,505. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC registered a drop of 2.26% to end the weekend at $95,303. Source: TradingView BTC began the previous week in the red, registering a marginal drop to go below $95,000 and settling at $94,830. However, it made a strong recovery on Tuesday, rising just over 4% and moving to $98,677. Buyers retained control on Wednesday, and BTC rose by 0.74% to settle at $99,409. However, it could not push above the $100,000 level as sellers took over, driving BTC down almost 4% on Thursday to $95,691. Buyers attempted to mount a recovery and prevent a drop below $95,000. However, they were unsuccessful, as BTC dropped by 1.52% and settled at $94,241. The weekend began with a recovery as BTC registered an increase of 0.89% and settled at $95,077. However, the recovery was short-lived as BTC returned to the red on Sunday, dropping almost 2% and settling at $93,475. The current session sees BTC marginally down as sellers look to drive it down to $90,000. If sellers maintain control, BTC could dip to $90,000 before recovering. However, if buyers can regain control, BTC will look to reclaim $95,000 and push on towards the $100,000 level. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is trading sideways below the $3,500 level as it struggles to build momentum and regain lost ground. ETH dipped below the 20-day SMA on Wednesday (December 18). The price continued to drop on Thursday, falling to $3,415. Sellers dragged ETH to an intraday low of $3,096 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of 1.62% and settled at $3,470.

It went above the 50-day SMA on Tuesday after a 2.11% increase and settled at $3,491. However, it could only manage a marginal rise on Wednesday, thanks to strong resistance around $3,500. ETH was back in the red on Thursday, falling almost 5% to $3,333. Buyers attempted a recovery on Friday as ETH rose to an intraday high of $3,438 before losing momentum. As a result, ETH fell and registered a marginal increase to settle at $3,331. ETH started the weekend positively, registering an increase of 2.14% on Saturday and moving to $3,402. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 1.46% to $3,352. The current session sees ETH up just over 1% and trading around the $3,400 mark. If buyers retain control, we could see ETH attempt to push towards $3,500. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is struggling to build momentum and reclaim $200, as it comes up against significant selling pressure at that level. SOL slipped below $200 on Thursday (December 19) when it dropped to $193. Sellers retained control on Friday as SOL dipped to an intraday low of $175 before recovering and settling at $194. However, bearish sentiment returned on Saturday as SOL fell almost 7% to $181. A marginal drop on Sunday took SOL to $180.

Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Analysis Dogwifhat (WIF) struggled to reclaim $2 after falling below the key level last weekend. WIF had dropped to an intraday low of $1.72 last Friday as sellers took control. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $2 and register an increase of 1.99% to settle at $2.10. Buyers attempted to push higher on Saturday but were unsuccessful as sellers took control. As a result, WIF dropped over 10% to slip below $2 and settle at $1.88. The price recovered on Sunday, reaching an intraday high of $2.04. However, it could not stay at this level and ultimately settled at $1.91. Buyers retained control on Monday as WIF reclaimed $2 to settle at $2.02, and an increase of 1.36% on Tuesday pushed the price to $2.05. Source: TradingView However, sentiment changed on Wednesday as WIF dropped 3.41% to go below $2 and settle at $1.98.

However, LINK lost momentum after reaching this level, allowing sellers to take control.

The weekend began with LINK registering an increase of 2.02% and settling at $21.97. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping almost 5% and settling at $20.94. The current session sees LINK up nearly 2% as it rebounds from the 50-day SMA. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB)’s decline saw its price slip below key support levels and moving averages. The price dipped below the 50-day SMA on Thursday (December 19) and had fallen to $0.719 by Sunday. However, ARB started the previous week on a positive note, rising over 7% and settling at $0.799.

The current session sees ARB up by 3.47% and trading around $0.766.

One of the most exciting prospects right now is the Lightchain AI (LCAI) presale , a groundbreaking platform merging AI and blockchain, currently offering early access to its innovative technology. Alongside Lightchain AI , other notable contenders include Shiba Inu (SHIB), a beloved memecoin with a loyal community, and Dogecoin (DOGE), the original memecoin that has captured global attention. These altcoins each bring something unique to the table—whether it's cutting-edge technology, practical applications, or community-driven momentum. But which one could transform a $1,000 investment into $50,000 by 2025? Let’s explore their potential. Lightchain AI- The Rising Star in Blockchain Technology Lightchain AI is quickly coming up as a top power in blockchain tech by smoothly mixing artificial smarts with spread out systems. Its new Proof of Intelligence (PoI) way to agree gives prizes to nodes for doing AI tasks, making the network safer and better. The Smart Machine for Virtual Intelligence (SMVI) acts like a speci͏al layer for fast AI work, helping apps in many fields such as health care, money management, and shipping. Lightchain AI cares about privacy and shows this by using Proofs with No Knowledge (PWNK) and secret math codes that keep data safe and follow world rules. With a clear plan and a good presale getting $5.4 million, Lightchain AI is ready to change the blockchain scene. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE)- Meme Coins with Staying Power Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have demonstrated remarkable resilience in the cryptocurrency market, evolving from meme-inspired tokens to assets with substantial investor interest. Dogecoin, introduced in 2013, has garnered a dedicated community and notable endorsements, contributing to its sustained relevance. Analysts project a potential 4,600% rally for DOGE by 2025, indicating significant growth prospects. Similarly, Shiba Inu, launched as the Dogecoin killer, has developed a robust ecosystem and community support. Predictions suggest SHIB could experience gains of up to 724% by 2025, reflecting its potential for substantial returns. Both tokens have leveraged their meme origins to build strong communities, which play a crucial role in their market performance. Their staying power is further reinforced by ongoing developments and increasing acceptance in various sectors. However, the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market necessitates careful consideration and due diligence by investors when evaluating these assets. Investment Potential- Which Altcoin Holds the 50x Promise by 2025? Among Lightchain AI (LCAI), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE), the competition for delivering 50x returns by 2025 is fierce. Lightchain AI stands out with its groundbreaking approach, combining blockchain transparency and AI capabilities to address scalability, privacy, and governance challenges. The platform’s Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enable efficient decentralized AI applications, attracting strong investor interest during its presale. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, though initially meme coins, have established loyal communities and real-world use cases. SHIB's ecosystem expansion and DOGE’s strong market presence keep them competitive. However, Lightchain AI's innovative technology, robust roadmap, and potential to revolutionize AI-blockchain integration position it as a leading contender for achieving 50x growth, making it a promising pick for long-term investors aiming for substantial returns. So invest now, and hold on for the ride as these altcoins continue to shake up the cryptocurrency market in the years to come. So, keep an eye on Lightchain AI's upcoming developments. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

DTX is more than a mere exchange with an innovative hybrid Layer-1 blockchain. Instead, combining both worlds’ best traits disrupts conventional centralized and decentralized trading platforms. The sixth presale stage of the recently completed DTX fetched an impressive $10.6 million. It is now bracing up for the seventh, with $0.14 being the present token price set to rise by just a couple of cents to $0.16. The rise in investment, on the other hand, proves that more people trust this company enough to invest, especially now that they are readying to launch their live platform come 2025’s first quarter. In their new 7th stage, they have added more than $100k and are over $10.7 million at the moment.

ADA Price Faces Decline Amid Leadership Struggles, While DTX Exchange Rises as a Promising Alternative in the Cryptocurrency Market Despite its impressive performance and rapid growth, Cardano faces numerous challenges, with DTX Exchange being the talk of the town. The coin has lost a substantial amount of its value within a month due to leadership conflicts and general market downturns. ADA price once traded at more than $1.32 in early December but has plunged below the psychological $1 mark while struggling to break past the $0.90 resistance level. Analysts have blamed these challenges not solely on market conditions but also on increased dissatisfaction from within Cardano’s community towards how it is run. Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano on his part, has openly accused Cardano Foundation leaders of inefficiency, which has made many holders of ADA think twice about their investments. This has drawn away a lot of potential investments as several investors have started following other options, such as DTX Exchange. Investing in DTX Exchange: A Promising Opportunity with 300,000 Wallets and a Projected 7,400% Token Value Increase More than 300,000 wallet addresses have been registered on it already, with projections indicating a potential 7,400% increase in token value after launch. So, analysts are saying that investing in DTX is becoming more appealing. which is expected to add additional functions and increase liquidity in the exchange. Additionally, the coming launch of the live exchange by DTX promises even more functionalities, including tokenized ETFs for regions where traditional ETF trading is prohibited. Such an addition alone can lure fresh investment opportunities seeking the diversity of crypto. Moreover, DTX’s revolutionary Phoenix Wallet provides safekeeping solutions for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets without the user losing control over his/her private keys, thus making it indispensable for security-conscious traders. Conclusion While Cardano is struggling with strife within its company and their ADA price is decreasing, the DTX Exchange is in a good position to grow rapidly with the help of its strong platform and new characteristics. With the high-leverage options this exchange offers to its users, access to various assets, and community governance systems, DTX becomes a suitable choice for both seasoned traders and beginners. Stage seven of the presale was ongoing at the time of writing, and massive amounts had been collected so far thus, this could benefit people looking for big earning chances within the crypto space these days.

38306368,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634761,1735563137,On-chain trading data showing strategic accumulation of AI agent tokens on Base,"There appears to be a strategic shift in fund flow into the new token class, belonging to AI agents. The trend is especially active on the tokenless Base chain, which allows for the cheapest launches and testing of new AI agents. Base, the tokenless chain by Coinbase, is on track to surpass Solana as the go-to network for AI agents. The shift happened in the last months of 2024, after the launch of the Virtuals Protocol platform. Ironically, the trend among AI agents was noted by an AI agent, set up to process data from selected smart wallets. NomAI was behind the discovery of the smart money inflows on Base, contributing to the hype around the new class of tokens. Virtuals Protocol leads AI surge on Base The inflow of funds was noticed soon after Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) became the top-gaining token for the year, despite appearing relatively late. VIRTUAL managed to surpass both meme trends and the earlier AI narrative. The inflow of new investments arrives at a time when mindshare for AI tokens has already peaked. However, the latest data show whales are aware of more opportunities in that space, in addition to the available liquidity on Base. The overall attention to the Base chain also revived the BRETT token, as well as the Aerodrome (AERO) token of the most active DEX. Base remains a predominantly DeFi network, with more than 36% of traffic dedicated to DEX activity and token swaps. After the initial development period, more signs are arising of smart money wallets moving into Base and buying the newest meme protocols. VIRTUAL, AIXBT, and GAME were among the top selections of these wallets. These strategic accumulation wallets have directed more than $205M to the AI agent narrative. Solana still carries some of the top AI agents While Virtuals Protocol churns out new agents and has turned into one of the key launchpads, Solana remains the carrier of established tokens. Solana’s exposure to AI agents contains AI16Z, valued at $1.39B, which itself builds the ELIZA launch platform. Almost all chains have entered the phase of relying on platforms to gain more users, as singular agentic personalities cannot hold user interest, or promise new token appreciation. Create an AI agent in seconds ft. the Solana Agent Kit by @sendaifun 🤖 pic.twitter.com/KJu8qtFiCf — Solana (@solana) December 29, 2024 ZEREBRO is the rising star of Solana AI memes this December, along with GRIFFAIN. Additionally, FARTCOIN trading remains popular, as the asset trades close to $1B market capitalization. AI agent tokens are also present in versions on several chains and DEXs, while Base is competing to grab more of the trading volume. The newer agents copy the model of Virtuals Protocol , creating and rapidly testing various agentic personalities to see which one will have the biggest social media success. The markets for AI agents are also boosting the crypto market for GPU rentals, though infrastructure tokens are yet to rally as hard as the meme assets. AI agent narrative remains strong at the end of the year The entire collection of AI agent tokens has already expanded its market capitalization above $10B once again, just days after dipping to $8.7B. The older AI tokens still hold a monopoly and remain more liquid, but the tokens by Virtuals Protocol are gaining mindshare and attention from traders. The available crypto platforms and Web3 features are tools for the fast launch of AI agents, with a wide reach on social media. The entire AI agent market grew to $5.1B in 2024, with use cases and products still developing. By 2030, the AI agent market outside of crypto is predicted to grow by more than 44% annually, expanding to over $47B . Agents in crypto are still not fully capable of trading, but they are making forays into market analysis. Crypto markets as a whole also pay attention to the AI narrative, singling out Gemini as the top predicted AI agent at the end of 2024.

Institutional investors and whales are adding to their winning position as we head for the second leg of the bull market. Tough large caps like Cardano (ADA) and Binance Coin (BNB) have performed very well. The vertical move in these coins has already happened and smart investors are shifting to potential coins like Cutoshi , which provides a higher win rate and profitability. Cardano struggles near $1 psychological level After the top formation in early December, Cardano has pulled back nearly 30% to the $0.90 level. In the recent rebound, it attempted to form a reversal; however, supply continues to increase at the $1 level. The 20-day moving average is working as immediate support for the price, while on the downside, $0.90 is a great demand zone. At the time of writing, Cardano is priced at $1.07, down 5.05% in the last 24 hours and 10.07% over the past week. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) has also dipped from the December high. With a market cap of $37.6 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $973 million, Cardano is trying to recover back from the profit booking. Can Binance Coin continue the momentum? The BNB coin recently hit an all-time high of $793.86 but saw a slight pullback, losing some momentum. Its price dropped to a swing low of $642, declining by 18.7%. Despite this dip, Binance Coin has a market cap of $102.8 billion and remains above the $700 mark, solidifying its position as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency. Binance’s continuous expansion into areas like NFTs, staking and DeFi opens up more opportunities for BNB to grow in value. The platform’s innovation and diverse offerings have boosted the adoption of its native token, reinforcing its role as a major player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Ripple Ruling, Details XRP Dramatic Surge After Trump Victory","Renowned UK newspaper The Times publishes an article regarding Judge Analisa Torres court ruling on the legal tussle between the U.S. SEC and Ripple. In a recent tweet , XRP community figure Digital Asset Investor called the public’s attention to the newspaper publication. The community member attached a photo of the article, highlighting the newspaper’s comment on the XRP ruling. https://twitter.com/digitalassetbuy/status/1873359370161111447The Times Publication on XRP Ruling The article, published yesterday under the heading ‘Judging Crypto’s True Value,’ discussed how the outcome of the U.S. election impacted the value of XRP and pointed out that XRP’s fortunes are closely tied to the legal dispute between the SEC and Ripple. The newspaper provided an overview of the lawsuit, revealing how it started. According to The Times, the SEC accused Ripple of violating securities laws by issuing XRP without obtaining regulatory approval. Following the summary judgment last year, the SEC sought $2 million in penalties from Ripple in March 2024. However, The Times emphasized that Judge Torres imposed a $125 million fine against Ripple in August. The newspaper emphasized that the lawsuit hinges on XRP’s regulatory treatment, focusing mainly on whether it should be classed as a security. Interestingly, it referenced the opinions of crypto bulls who think the lawsuit is part of the SEC’s aggressive stance against crypto under Gary Gensler's leadership. In addition, The Times noted that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump chose pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins as Gensler’s replacement. XRP Outstanding Performance After Trump Victory Furthermore, the newspaper highlighted XRP’s impressive performance since Donald Trump's reelection. This has seen its value quadruple, pushing it to fourth place in the global crypto ranking. Specifically, the price of XRP surged from around $0.55 to $2.86 in one month, marking a hefty surge of 420%. XRP’s outstanding performance reflects optimism about potential favorable regulation under Trump’s administration. Current Status of Ripple Lawsuit In October, the SEC officially filed the lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. It hopes to overturn Judge Torres’ ruling on programmatic sales and other distributions of XRP, which were deemed non-securities. The Wall Street watchdog will officially file its appellate brief on or before January 15, 2025, a few days before Trump's inauguration. Despite this, legal experts still believe the new SEC leadership can dismiss the lawsuit at any time. Attorney Fred Rispoli speculated that the new leadership could agree to settle its lawsuit against Ripple via a less aggressive stance. He stated that the SEC might accept a lesser fine from Ripple than the $125 million penalty Judge Torres ordered the company to pay. It remains unclear whether the Ripple lawsuit will be resolved through a settlement under Atkins' leadership. At press time, XRP is priced at $2.07, reflecting a decline of 5.35% in 24 hours.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/30/top-uk-newspaper-highlights-sec-v-ripple-ruling-details-xrp-dramatic-surge-after-trump-victory/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-uk-newspaper-highlights-sec-v-ripple-ruling-details-xrp-dramatic-surge-after-trump-victory,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
42415967,b6f940b1-4f20-4a04-96fe-e05d0fd5c576,1735562884,Crypto Scammers Are Now Stealing From Other Crypto Thieves,"Crypto scammers have finally found their thieving match: Themselves.  A new scam has been making the rounds mainly on YouTube that would make even the most cunning trickster tip their hat, security firm Kaspersky said in a security update last week.  ""I have USDT stored in my wallet, and I have the seed phrase. How do I transfer my funds to another wallet?,” Kaspersky noted one such comment. The specific wallet held over $8,000 worth of stablecoins on the Tron blockchain. A seed phrase is a word string that grants their knowers access to a crypto wallet.  This question, however, was not from a crypto novice but a cleverly laid trap. Those stablecoins were held in a multi-signature wallet, and theoretically require a gas fee to be able to withdraw funds.  However, when thieves attempted to siphon off the funds by sending Tron’s TRX tokens to the wallet, the sent tokens mysteriously evaporated into another wallet controlled by the scammers.  The catch is that the bait wallet is set up as a multi-signature wallet. To authorize outgoing transactions in such wallets, approval from two or more people is required, so transferring USDT to a personal wallet won’t work and instead gets transferred somewhere else.  “The scammers are impersonating beginners who foolishly share access to their crypto wallets, tricking equally naive thieves — who end up becoming the victims,” Kaspersky said. “In this scenario, the scammers are something like digital Robin Hoods, as the scheme primarily targets other crooked individuals.”  This scam isn't a lone wolf either, with several instances across the internet teeming with similar comments from new accounts, all of which dangled the same seed phrase, Kaspersky said.  As such, gas fees are typically cheap and cost less than $10 across most blockchains, meaning the hustle is likely targeting wannabe thieves rather than being a complex operation seeking to steal thousands, or even millions, of dollars.

Cardano Adds 100,000 New Smart Contracts in 2024","Smart contract deployment on the Cardano network reached a significant milestone this year, nearly crossing 100,000, as blockchain gains traction. Cardano Blockchain Insight collated the data from the Plutus-based smart contract deployer, which specifies the amount deployed by each software version. For context, Plutus is a smart contract platform on the Cardano network that allows developers to create decentralized applications that can interact with the blockchain.Plutus V2 Leads the Smart Contract ManiaThe second version of the Plutus programming language was the star of the show, as it was responsible for most of the smart contract deployment.At the start of the year, there were just 8,083 Plutus V2 scripts on the blockchain. However, the total tally surged to 105,500 on December 29, appreciating by 97,417 smart contracts during the year.Notably, the Plutus V2 application went live on the Cardano network in September 2022 after the Vasil hard fork. The script enhanced smart contract features in the Cardano ecosystem, introducing features such as reference inputs, inline datum, and reference script.Meanwhile, the Plutus V1 also saw substantial traction. The maiden smart contract script added 573 smart contracts to the network, growing from 6,296 at the beginning of the year to 6,869 as of December 27.Furthermore, the newly introduced Plutus V3 programming software also recorded considerable usage in its short time of existence. For context, the Cardano ecosystem debuted the third version of Plutus in preparation for the September 1 Chang hard fork , which introduced decentralized governance on the blockchain.In February, the Cardano team released Plutus V3 on the SanchoNet testnet, which has enhanced features compared to earlier versions. The application entered the mainnet in August and deployed 444 smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. Cardano Cardano The New Home of Decentralized ApplicationsMeanwhile, Cardano has established itself as one of the biggest smart contract-enabled chains in the crypto sector. It is on the grounds of its status that EMURGO partnered with BitcoinOS to bring its glaring smart contract features to the Bitcoin network.Although the partnership suffered a major setback, Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, insisted that his team is committed to bringing decentralized finance to the network, housing over $1.8 trillion in liquidity.Nonetheless, Cardano has shown the capacity to evolve with blockchain technology, periodically releasing new features to boost scalability and usability.

After that, the Treasury will take ""extraordinary measures"" to cut borrowing.  ""I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,"" she wrote. In June 2023, Congress suspended the debt limit until Jan. 1, 2025.   Risk assets weakened into the market close, just before the letter was publicized. U.S. equities fell, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all losing about 1%. Bitcoin dropped as much as 4% from its intraday high.   Raising the debt ceiling has historically been a negative signal for the largest cryptocurrency, which has dropped or underperformed during the following days on the past five occasions.  This December has not been a strong month for bitcoin, which is down 3% and on track for its first red month since August.   To add to the political and economic uncertainty, President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration will occur on Jan. 20, between the dates Yellen highlighted.  According to Zerohedge, Congress first established a debt limit of $45 billion back in 1939 and has raised it 103 times as government spending continues to outpace tax receipts. The U.S. national debt is now over $36.2 trillion.   Another influence on the bitcoin price is its parallel to previous cycles. Since the cycle low that occurred during the FTX collapse in November 2022, BTC has been aligned with the previous two cycles.   It is now just shy of a 500% return, similar to the two previous cycles at the same point in the cycle. That's not a good sign for the bulls.  The 2018-2022 and 2015-2018 cycles both saw significant drawdowns at this point in the cycle, highlighted by the red box in the chart below.

With the U.S. election and Bitcoin halving cycles behind, history suggests Ether could once again shine in the opening months of the year. However, not everyone is convinced that the market conditions will be favorable for such a surge. History Could Repeat Itself for Ether Looking back, the first quarter following a U.S. election and Bitcoin halving cycle has been a fruitful period for Ether. In Q1 2017, ETH saw a massive rally of 518%, and it followed up with a 161% increase in Q1 2021. These impressive gains outpaced Bitcoin’s returns during the same periods, which stood at 11.9% and 103.2%, respectively, according to CoinGlass data. With these historic performances in mind, some analysts are optimistic that Ether could once again lead the way in Q1 2025. A key factor driving this optimism is the rise of spot Ether ETFs, which have seen substantial inflows recently . In fact, data from Farside Investors reveals that Ether ETFs have experienced inflows in 22 out of the past 24 trading days, resulting in a net influx of over $2.5 billion. This growing interest in Ether ETFs has sparked predictions that total inflows could exceed $50 billion in 2025. A Hawkish Macro Environment Could Slow Momentum Despite the upbeat outlook from some industry observers, others warn that the broader macroeconomic environment could dampen the potential for a robust Q1 rally. Markus Thielen, the founder of 10x Research, has expressed caution, predicting that Ether may struggle to outperform in 2025. Thielen suggests that a “hawkish” macro climate could slow market momentum, especially as liquidity tailwinds from previous years begin to fade. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent shift in its interest rate policy adds weight to Thielen’s argument. Following the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting, projections for interest rate cuts in 2025 were slashed from five to just two, leading to expectations of a less favorable environment for riskier assets like Ether. While Thielen still sees a potential for Bitcoin to rise to $160,000 under ideal conditions, he predicts that Ether may fail to reach its all-time high, currently sitting at $3,997, well below its peak of $4,878 in November 2021.

38305800,https://finbold.com/?p=224159,1735562400,EU’s MiCA regulation takes full effect today; Here’s what you need to know,"Today, December 30, 2024, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation has now fully come into force in the European Union (EU), marking a key moment for the cryptocurrency industry. According to the regulators, the MiCa aims to standardize the regulation of crypto-assets, bolster consumer protections, and ensure financial stability within the EU’s burgeoning crypto market. However, the controversy looms over this set of rules and some experts believe it would have an overall negative effect. Happy MiCA Regulation Day!! More innovation blocking regulations for Europe. It's a real invasion of privacy. Keep in mind that they're now planning to track every transaction and wallet you use. But not every exchange is compliant yet, they have a year to do so. And even… — Crypto Tips (@cryptotipsreal) December 30, 2024 In this context, Finbold looked into the official documentation , asked artificial intelligence (AI) models for a summary and consulted three other recent sources to understand what will change and what crypto investors need to know starting 2025, now that the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation fully comes into force in the EU. For this report, we consulted xAI’s Grok 2 and OpenAI’s o1 , while also referencing EY ’s report , Local Nodes ’s article , Ulam Labs ‘s guide , and Binance’s guidelines especially on MiCa’s stablecoins regulation. What is MiCA? MiCA, shorthand for Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, is the EU’s answer to the regulatory void surrounding crypto-assets. It provides a legal framework that covers all crypto-assets not previously regulated by existing financial laws. The primary objective is to bring clarity, safeguard investors, and curb market abuse while, allegedly, fostering innovation in the crypto sector. With MiCA, entities looking to offer or trade crypto-assets in the EU must now secure authorization. This includes issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and electronic money tokens (EMTs). Moreover, issuers must draft detailed crypto-asset white papers, which are mandatory before public offerings or trading. These documents must transparently outline the crypto-asset, its issuer, associated rights, risks, and technology. Marketing communications will undergo scrutiny to ensure they are fair, clear, and not misleading. These communication must align with the white paper information and include risk warnings. One notable aspect is the prohibition on granting interest on ARTs and EMTs, which could affect decentralized finance (DeFi) operations. Additionally, issuers must adhere to stringent governance, risk management, and compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. ARTs must be backed by a reserve of assets to match the circulating tokens’ value. MiCA not only aims to regulate but to lead in setting global crypto standards. Its focus on stablecoins , for instance, could influence international regulatory approaches. One of the regulation’s effects is already having its role in removing DAI and Tether’s USDT offerings from the continent. With Bitcoin surpassing the $100,000 mark, the timing of MiCA’s full implementation seems strategic, aligning with a renewed investor interest in crypto-related products. Stablecoins and tokenization Stablecoins are at the heart of MiCA’s regulatory focus, offering a stable bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. Tokenization, the process of creating digital representations of assets, is now expanding to include commodities like gold, under a regulated framework. On that note, while the regulatory clarity is seen as positive for some EU established providers, critics believe it could harm competition and prevent innovation. Despite promising clarity and security, the MiCA regulation also presents challenges, especially for smaller entities due to compliance costs. Legal requirements and high costs could prevent smaller players to participate in the industry, potentially cartelizing the market. The timing, here, is also notable, considering how tokenization is growing and attracting investors’ attention worldwide. In particular, finance giants like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ) see relevant value into the tokenization . BlackRock recently launching its own tokenized fund, BUIDL , in partnership with Securitize. As we move into 2025, the full impact of MiCA will unfold. Companies will need to secure CASP licenses, ensure compliance with market abuse prevention, and adapt to strict AML and CTF controls. The regulation’s evolution might see it addressing currently unregulated areas like DeFi and NFTs, ensuring its relevance in a rapidly changing market. One of these effects, that could be potentially harmful already started developing in the EU, as Finbold reported in March. Essentially, the European Union banned anonymous crypto payments to hosted wallets and also prohibited privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero ( XMR ). Page 23 of European Parliament’s AML legislation. Source: European Parliament In conclusion, MiCA’s full enforcement is a landmark event for the EU’s crypto industry, potentially setting a global benchmark for crypto regulation – for the better or for the worse. Stakeholders must now navigate this new terrain with diligence to harness the opportunities it presents while adhering to its stringent requirements.

XRP, which crossed the pivotal $2 mark early this month, has analysts closely monitoring its trend continuation potential. The asset has crashed by at least 30% since approaching $3 this month.In a post on X, analyst Egrag shared a detailed analysis, emphasizing the importance of the Williams Alligator Indicator for XRP's bull run. This tool uses three moving averages (Jaw, Teeth, and Lips) to identify market trends.According to Egrag, XRP’s current alignment of these moving averages suggests bullish momentum, provided XRP maintains its position above the equilibrium zone without retracing.What the Charts RevealEgrag's chart highlighted two critical ""Break of Structure"" (BOS) points in XRP’s long-term chart. The first instance occurred in the first week of 2018 when XRP broke its all-time high. A similar attempt happened in 2021, but it failed to send XRP to a new all-time high.Currently, a new break of structure is developing, with XRP trading above the equilibrium level of $2. The Williams Alligator Indicator shows alignment, suggesting a possible continuation of XRP's bullish trend. For context, a similar alignment appeared in late 2017, and by January 2018, XRP was trading at an all-time high of over $3.80. XRP long-term chart with Williams Alligator Indicator While the current observation is promising, Egrag warns that confirmation depends on the upcoming monthly candles. He noted that the current monthly candle appears bearish. However, the opening and closing of the subsequent candle will help solidify XRP’s trajectory.

(Ethereum Price Analysis),"Ethereum recently found stability at the $3K support region after facing substantial selling pressure, leading to a consolidation phase. A golden cross on the daily chart further signals the potential for a mid-term bullish rebound, suggesting optimism in the market’s outlook. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ethereum’s price action has been marked by increased volatility, particularly after its rejection at the $4K resistance level. This decline pushed the asset below the crucial $3.5K threshold, ultimately finding strong support at the $3K zone. This level holds considerable significance due to the confluence of demand and the alignment of the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. On the other hand, the emergence of a golden cross, where the 100-day MA has crossed above the 200-day MA, further emphasizes a potential shift toward bullish sentiment. However, Ethereum remains confined below the $3.5K resistance, requiring a decisive breakout to catalyze a new upward trend. A successful breach could set the stage for a renewed rally. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Ethereum’s decline from the ascending price channel culminated in a test of the $3K region. This zone is not only psychologically significant but also aligns with the 0.5 ($3.2K) and 0.618 ($3K) Fibonacci retracement levels, reinforcing it as a robust support line. Current price action suggests a potential buildup of buying interest, with this region serving as a critical defense line for bulls. If this support holds, Ethereum is likely to embark on a fresh bullish surge, with targets set toward reclaiming the $3.5K resistance. Conversely, a sudden breakdown below the $3K threshold could trigger a cascade of liquidations, driving the price toward the $2.5K support, marking a deeper retracement. Onchain Analysis By Shayan After Ethereum’s significant correction to the $3K level, the futures market has begun a cooling-off period, raising expectations for a potential bullish rebound. The funding rates metric, a trusted proxy for futures market sentiment, offers valuable insights into this development. Ethereum’s consolidation above the critical $3K support level has allowed bullish participants to re-enter the market. This renewed demand is reflected in the uptick in funding rates, signaling that more traders are opening long positions. Such behavior often indicates growing confidence among market participants as they anticipate a reversal in the current trend. The recent spike in funding rates suggests an influx of buyers, which, if sustained, could drive a substantial bullish rebound. This renewed buying pressure can potentially push Ethereum toward the crucial $4K resistance in the short to mid-term. The post Is ETH Ready to Challenge $3.5K and $4K After Recent Crash?

Among the numerous tokens , Squid Game (squidgame.top) SQUID stands out with massive gains. The token has rallied over 6,700% in the past week, trading at $0.0001203 after a 300% surge in the last 24 hours, according to data retrieved by Finbold from CoinMarketCap on December 30. SQUID one-week price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap It’s worth noting that SQUID is part of a wave of tokens aiming to profit from popular cultural phenomena despite its questionable history. Squid Game scam concerns The Squid Game tokens first gained popularity in 2021 during the show’s initial season, with some witnessing a massive price surge before plummeting in what was identified as a ‘ rug pull ’ scam. For one token, developers abruptly abandoned the project, leaving investors with losses as the token’s value dropped to nearly zero within minutes. Following this collapse, Binance investigated the 2021 SQUID token crash, labeling it a likely scam. The exchange noted that projects tied to high-profile pop culture phenomena often exploit the resulting hype to lure unsuspecting buyers into risky or fraudulent schemes. Analyzing Squidgame.top legitimacy The Squidgame.top token launched on December 26, the same day as the new season, has reignited suspicions of a potential repeat of the 2021 scam. Interestingly, analysis of the token by the cryptocurrency scam detection platform Token Sniffer indicates that the token shows signs of a potential scam. Squidgame.top security analysis. Source: Token Sniffer SQUID’s market capitalization is estimated at $5.57 million, but CoinMarketCap stressed that this figure is unverifiable, raising transparency concerns. Credibility remains uncertain with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.6 million and a self-reported circulating supply of 45.6 billion—equal to its maximum supply. To this end, blockchain security firm PeckShield has flagged multiple Squid Game-themed tokens as fraudulent. In one case, the entity noted that a token on the Base network experienced a 99% value collapse shortly after launch, with its creator holding the majority of the supply in what appeared to be a coordinated dump. #PeckShieldAlert Beware of scam #SquidGame tokens circulating in the wild.

The proliferation of similar tokens can confuse investors and hint at attempts by bad actors to exploit the token’s popularity through fraudulent schemes. Squid Game token variations. Source: CoinMarketCap Similar concerns have emerged on the Solana ( SOL ) network, where several wallets holding large portions of the supply appear to be linked, suggesting manipulation and potential exploitation of unsuspecting investors. While SQUID’s price surge may tempt speculative traders, its controversial history and the lingering red flags, such as the lack of underlying use cases, point to significant risks.

38305705,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634740,1735561933,XRP leads crypto decline with 5.2% drop. Are the bears taking charge?,"XRP just gave the entire crypto market a reality check, plunging 5.2% in the last 24 hours and wiping out gains faster than a rug-pull. Other big players like Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) followed suit, shedding up to 2%. The overall crypto market tumbled by 3% too. A stronger U.S. dollar , fueled by renewed investor confidence, is slapping every risk asset in sight. Global markets aren’t having a great time either, with Asian equities spiraling down and U.S. stock futures pointing to more pain ahead. It would seem that the bears are starting to get a bit too comfortable. Crypto bleeding, markets reeling Friday was ugly for U.S. equities. Investors bailed out of positions, trimming risk as uncertainty looms large. The Asia-Pacific index, which had been riding a five-day winning streak, flipped and erased its gains. Meanwhile, futures contracts on U.S. indices looked just as miserable on Monday. Dow Jones futures lost 81 points, down 0.19%, while S&P 500 futures slipped 0.16%. Nasdaq-100? It barely moved, as if it was holding its breath for the carnage ahead. Here’s the real problem: the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar’s strength against major global currencies, has been climbing. Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies move in the opposite direction of the dollar. When the greenback gets stronger, crypto gets weaker. Why? A strong dollar makes traditional assets like U.S. Treasuries and stocks look a lot more tempting to investors. Crypto, by comparison, feels like that risky bet you regret at 3 AM. This surge in dollar strength comes with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in January. Love or hate him, the guy seems genuinely into crypto. Though his economic policies are expected to strengthen the dollar more, leaving cryptos to fend for themselves in a hostile environment. The death of the “Santa Claus Rally” and what the future holds for XRP The so-called “Santa Claus Rally,” where markets historically rally during the last five trading days of December and the first two of January, is officially dead. Instead, it’s looking more like a “Santa Claus Meltdown.” This is only the third time in history that U.S. stocks have posted back-to-back losses during the holiday trading period. So much for ending the year on a high note. XRP, meanwhile, is actually the biggest winner of the Trump-infused rally. It has surged by over 370% since the win on November 5. With Ripple winning its case against the SEC last summer, the token’s credibility got a much-needed boost. A federal judge ruled that XRP isn’t a security when sold on retail exchanges, though it’s considered an unregistered security when sold to institutions. That ruling was a win for Ripple and XRP holders alike, but not everyone’s convinced that the token has long-term staying power. Sure, it’s great for cross-border payments, but has that translated into meaningful business use cases? Not really. Even with ETFs for XRP now in the works from firms like Bitwise, WisdomTree, and 21Shares, skeptics aren’t convinced this token has legs. For all its regulatory wins, XRP still feels like it’s struggling to find its place in the crypto ecosystem.

38307141,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53396,1735561848,Best Cryptos to Join for Long Term: Qubetics Presale Sets New Milestones as Algorand and SEI Hold Their Dominance,"The world of cryptocurrency is vast, dynamic, and brimming with opportunities for investors ready to explore new horizons. For those seeking the best cryptos to join for long term, it’s crucial to find projects that combine strong fundamentals with real-world utility and growth potential. Three projects currently leading the charge in innovation and investment potential are Qubetics, Algorand, and SEI. While Algorand is renowned for its scalable and environmentally friendly blockchain, SEI has made waves with its decentralised exchange infrastructure. Meanwhile, Qubetics is setting a new standard in blockchain innovation, with its decentralised VPN and unparalleled presale performance. Here’s a closer look at how these projects are shaping the future of crypto and why they deserve your attention. Qubetics: Revolutionising Blockchain with Decentralised VPN Qubetics is redefining how businesses and individuals use blockchain technology by introducing transformative solutions like its Decentralised VPN (dVPN) . This feature provides unparalleled privacy, security, and freedom for internet users. Unlike traditional VPNs, which rely on centralised servers and are susceptible to censorship or data breaches, Qubetics’ dVPN leverages blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer network, ensuring no single authority controls the data flow. Imagine a journalist in a country with heavy censorship using Qubetics’ dVPN to access restricted content and share news with the world. Or consider a business professional who needs to securely share sensitive files across global teams without risking unauthorised access. Qubetics ensures privacy and transparency, making these scenarios seamless and stress-free. The success of the Qubetics presale is another reason why this project is capturing attention. Now in its 14th stage, it has sold over 385 million $TICS tokens to more than 12,400 holders, raising an impressive $8.1 million. At the current price of $0.037 per token, $TICS offers an exceptional entry point, with a 10% price increase expected by the weekend. Analysts are predicting substantial growth for $TICS. By the end of the presale, the token is expected to reach $0.25, representing a 630% ROI. A $250,000 investment today would secure approximately 7,307,692 $TICS tokens, which could be worth over $109.6 million if $TICS hits $15 post-mainnet launch. Qubetics isn’t just about impressive numbers. It’s about providing solutions that empower individuals and businesses to navigate the digital world securely and efficiently. With its decentralised VPN and innovative ecosystem, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to join for long term. Algorand: The Green Blockchain Leader Algorand has established itself as a leader in the blockchain space by prioritising scalability, security, and sustainability. Designed to process transactions quickly and efficiently, Algorand uses a Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism, which significantly reduces energy consumption compared to traditional blockchain models. For example, imagine a global charity using Algorand to track and distribute donations transparently, ensuring every dollar reaches its intended recipient. Or consider a fintech startup leveraging Algorand’s blockchain to enable instant, low-cost international payments. These use cases highlight the versatility and real-world applicability of Algorand’s technology. Algorand’s commitment to sustainability has also made it a favourite among eco-conscious investors and developers. Its growing ecosystem includes a wide range of decentralised applications (dApps), from decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms to digital identity solutions. For investors seeking projects with strong fundamentals and real-world impact, Algorand remains a top choice among the best cryptos to join for long term. SEI: Revolutionising Decentralised Exchanges SEI is a rising star in the blockchain world, focusing on improving the infrastructure of decentralised exchanges (DEXs). Designed as a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, SEI is tailored to the needs of financial applications, enabling lightning-fast transactions and low fees. Picture a crypto trader who needs to execute trades instantly to capitalise on market opportunities. SEI’s technology ensures that transactions are processed in seconds, with minimal slippage, giving traders the competitive edge they need. SEI’s emphasis on scalability and interoperability makes it a favourite among developers building DeFi platforms and trading solutions. Its ecosystem continues to grow, attracting innovative projects that leverage SEI’s robust infrastructure to create seamless user experiences. As decentralised finance gains traction, SEI’s role in shaping the future of trading and financial applications makes it one of the best cryptos to join for long term. Why Qubetics Stands Out While Algorand leads in sustainability and SEI excels in decentralised finance, Qubetics offers a broader vision with its decentralised VPN and comprehensive blockchain solutions. The ongoing presale is a unique opportunity to invest in a project poised for exponential growth, with analysts forecasting a price of up to $15 per $TICS after the mainnet launch. Beyond financial returns, Qubetics is solving real-world problems by empowering users with privacy, security , and accessibility. Its innovative approach ensures it stands out as a game-changer in the blockchain space. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is brimming with opportunities, but only a few projects truly stand out as game-changers. Qubetics, Algorand, and SEI each bring unique value to the table, making them some of the best cryptos to join for long term. For those looking to maximise their investments, Qubetics stands out as the ultimate choice. Its focus on decentralised solutions, successful presale, and ambitious roadmap make it a project you can’t afford to miss. Visit the Qubetics website today and secure your $TICS tokens before the next price hike. The future of blockchain starts with Qubetics.

A breakout above a critical resistance level could signal a potential shift in price action, paving the way for Ethereum’s dominance and potential rally in Q1 2025. Ethereum Price Poised For Breakout Against Bitcoin A crypto analyst, known as ‘Daan Crypto Trades,’ shared a price chart representing the ETH/BTC trading pair, providing a detailed analysis of the probability of a reversal and its impact on the strength of the altcoin market. According to the analyst’s X (formerly Twitter) post, the Ethereum price is attempting to form a higher low near the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at 0.0337, signaling the start of a potential trend reversal against Bitcoin. Related Reading: El Salvador Bitcoin Buying Spree Continues, BTC Holdings Now At 6,000 The 0.786 Fibonacci level appears to act as a strong support zone, indicating a possible shift from bearish to bullish. Daan also disclosed that the 0.04 BTC level has emerged as a key resistance level that needs to be broken for further bullish momentum to occur. The analyst emphasized that a breakout above the 0.04 BTC level would confirm the mid-high timeframe trend reversal. If this happens, it could significantly weaken Bitcoin’s dominance and indicate an increased strength in altcoins, especially Ethereum. In the context of the ETH/BTC analysis, a mid-high timeframe reversal suggests that Ethereum could establish a bullish trend over the next few weeks to months. This timeframe is also used to assess broader trends rather than short-term price movements. Moving forward, Daan revealed that historically, the ETH/BTC trading pair have performed well during the first quarter of the year, aligning with seasonal trends that typically favor altcoins. If this historical pattern holds, the analyst believes that a breakout above the 0.04 Bitcoin level could lead to a significant rally for Ethereum and the altcoin market. Additionally, this projected rally is expected to occur in Q1 2025, resulting in a significant surge from the 0.040 BTC level to the 0.046 mark, as indicated by the analyst’s chart. Implications On The Altcoin Season If Ethereum breaks out of the 0.04 BTC level, it could mark the beginning of a bullish phase not just for the second-largest cryptocurrency but for the broader altcoin market. Historically, Ethereum’s market performance has acted as a measure of altcoin strength. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Fibonacci And Elliott Wave Analysis Suggests $15 By May 2025 If Bitcoin’s dominance declines, it could trigger a surge of interest and demand from investors to altcoins. Currently, Bitcoin’s dominance is standing at 57.8%, still relatively high despite price declines and market volatility. For the altcoin season to fully kickstart, the market’s attention will need to shift from Bitcoin to alternative cryptocurrencies. A crypto analyst, identified as the ‘Crypto Rover’, disclosed in a recent post that Bitcoin’s dominance is experiencing a bearish retest and could potentially decline to 42%. If this occurs, the analyst asserts that it would be incredibly bullish for altcoins, potentially marking the start of the anticipated altcoin season.

He Announced His Goals!,"Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed the critical threshold of $100,000 in the rally that began after Donald Trump’s victory. While this record is seen as one of the most important bullish milestones of the 2024/2025 bull market, the BTC price has been performing relatively poorly in recent weeks. Analysts have noted that preparations for a parabolic altcoin season in 2025 have negatively impacted Bitcoin’s bullish sentiment. At this point, veteran analyst Peter Brandt, with 50 years of experience, said that the Bitcoin price is at a critical junction. According to Brandt, Bitcoin has two options ahead: a rally towards $120,000 or a further correction towards the support level above $78,000. In terms of the bullish outlook, Brandt stated that the Bitcoin price could form the famous Hump Slump Bump Dump Pump (HSBDP) chart pattern. In terms of the possibility of a correction, Brandt said that Bitcoin could potentially form a head and shoulders (H&S) pattern on its daily chart, which could lead to a significant drop. This is a head and shoulders top pattern. It might complete and take price to $78,000; it might fail with a thrust hire: or, it might morph into something else. But as it stands right now, it is a head and shoulders top and must be chartist dealt with for what it is. pic.twitter.com/b9AUUO7ddL — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 29, 2024 *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance gains traction with its focus on real estate tokenization and DeFi, challenging established players like Dogecoin and Ripple. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The potential for massive returns Rexas Finance’s presale gains momentum Conclusion As new entrants with innovative systems enter the market, the crypto industry changes dramatically. Although Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) have long been leading players, Rexas Finance (RXS) is fast acquiring popularity. With a presale price of $0.175, Rexas Finance generates news as a transforming agent in real estate tokenizing and decentralized finance (DeFi). Rexas Finance: The potential for massive returns Ripple has long been a favorite among institutional investors for its cross-border payment features. Still, a lack of diversification and legal hurdles have slowed its development. Likewise, Dogecoin suffers to retain long-term value and investor confidence even if it is a meme coin that is rather popular. With its creative approach to real estate tokenization and DeFi, Rexas Finance presents a convincing substitute. While Dogecoin is a speculative asset and Ripple concentrates on payments, Rexas Finance provides real-world solutions that address critical holes in asset management and financial services. Blockchain-based Rexas Finance is meant to redefine DeFi by tokenizing actual assets, especially real estate, hence transforming DeFi. Tokenization lets properties be split into smaller, tradable pieces so that investors may access high-value assets once out of reach. This invention makes transactions efficient, open, and safe. Rexas Finance provides rapid, dependable financial services catered for a new age by using advanced blockchain technologies. Driven by its presale performance and creative use case, Rexas Finance’s listing price is expected to climb dramatically following its launch. Projected to have a strong market debut, analysts might double investments several times over a short timeframe. The platform’s emphasis on high-value asset tokenization fits market patterns supporting cryptocurrencies with practical use. Rexas Finance’s presale gains momentum Rexas Finance’s ongoing presale has been truly remarkable. At its eleventh stage, the project has sold over 381.2 million tokens, raising over $33.3 million. This result demonstrates increased investor confidence in Rexas Finance as a game-changing cryptocurrency. At $0.175 per token, the possibility for exponential gains has sparked broad interest. Early adopters who invest $800 may see their portfolio grow to $32,000 within eight weeks of the token’s expected market debut. Recent listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, two of the most reputable sites for monitoring cryptocurrency performance, confirm Rexas Finance’s reputation even more. These listings draw more investors to the project’s expanding ecosystem because they offer more visibility and support its validity. One of the company’s top blockchain security companies, CertiK, has also inspected the platform to guarantee openness and credibility for its customers. Rexas Finance presale valued RXS at merely $0.030 at the first stage. Rising by 485% to $0.175, the presale has moved to stage 11; the token’s value has increased; early investors have witnessed a staggering 6x return on investment (ROI). The community-driven approach of the project and its artistic aspects have attracted institutional and personal investors, creating demand and bolstering projections of RXS’s future price. Rexas Finance is redefining decentralized finance by merging blockchain technology with actual asset tokenization. Its capacity to provide the real estate industry with safe and open transactions sets it apart from the changing scene of cryptocurrencies. Investors looking for significant profits increasingly consider Rexas Finance a future-proof investment. At its current presale price of $0.175, Rexas Finance allows investors to make an impressive 3,900% return, which means that a $800 investment could turn into $32,000 in just eight weeks. This considerable percentage gain shows that RXS could become more popular than Ripple and Dogecoin, thanks to its cutting-edge DeFi and real estate tokenization systems. Conclusion With utility in decentralized finance and real estate tokenizing, Rexas Finance is positioned to beat Ripple and Dogecoin. Having a presale price of $0.175 and having raised over $33.3 million, the platform is being known as a transforming agent in the cryptocurrency scene. Rexas Finance is changing the financial scene as its ecosystem grows, and this creative coin attracts investors. Investing $800 now might become $32,000 in just eight weeks.

Carter, who served as the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981, holds the record for the longest-lived president in American history. President-elect Donald Trump called him a good person but a “terrible president,” and we probably have a good idea why. Will Trump’s second-chance administration outpace who many call the most “humble and devoted” commander-in-chief in US history? Probably yes, maybe not. A presidency that battled stagflation with a humanitarian vision Jimmy Carter assumed office at a time when the US economy grappled with “stagflation,” a term coined to describe the unusual combination of high inflation and stagnant economic growth. For average Americans, this economic malaise meant skyrocketing prices for essential goods like groceries and gas while wages failed to keep pace. Families struggled to make ends meet, and the purchasing power of their income eroded, creating widespread frustration and uncertainty about the future. The economic malaise was exacerbated by President Richard Nixon’s 1973 decision to abandon the gold standard, which devalued the dollar and triggered a rise in import prices. Inflation soared, and unemployment followed suit. By the time Carter left office in 1981, the joblessness rate had climbed to 7.4%, up from the mid-5% range during the early years of his presidency. To tackle the developing issue, Carter appointed Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1979. Volcker adopted an aggressive policy of raising interest rates, a move that eventually curbed inflation but came at the cost of a deep recession. Carter’s speeches during this period often reflected his pragmatic approach. “We will not solve inflation by increasing unemployment,” he told the American Society of Newspaper Editors in 1978. “It is a myth that the government itself can stop inflation.” His administration prioritized policies aimed at reducing inequality and supporting vulnerable populations. Carter’s most notable efforts included investments in energy conservation programs to mitigate the energy crisis and a focus on education through the creation of the Department of Education, which sought to provide equal access to quality schooling. However, his tenure was overshadowed by the immediate economic struggles faced by everyday Americans, including soaring food and housing costs, issues that remain strikingly familiar today. Jimmy Carter and US-China relations: A gamble Trump does not care for Jimmy Carter’s most consequential foreign policy achievement was his diplomatic relations with China. In December 1978, he announced the severance of ties with the Republic of China in Taiwan and the recognition of the People’s Republic of China, effective January 1, 1979. This bold move aimed to promote peace and strategic alignment during the Cold War. “The normalization of US-China relations has no other purpose than to promote peace,” Carter declared at the time. While the decision was controversial, it laid the groundwork for decades of Sino-American cooperation and competition. “China expresses deep condolences on the passing of former US President Jimmy Carter. Former President Carter was a key promoter and decision-maker in the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. Over the years, he made significant contributions to the development of China-US relations and the friendship between the two countries, which we highly commend,” Chinese spokesperson Mao Ning said. Donald Trump will be less likely to follow the former President’s footsteps. The former bashed China severally during and after his first term, even going as far as to say he’d seen evidence of COVID-19 originating from a Chinese lab. To add salt to injury, China is a member of the BRICS bloc, which doesn’t sit well with the incoming US President. His campaign issued proposals of new tariffs ranging from 10% to 20% on most foreign goods, with Chinese imports shouldering the greatest burden, targeted at a staggering 60%. Not so friendly now, is it? It’s pretty clear how Trump is excited to “get one over” China with his plans to adopt crypto, a technology Mainland China is at loggerheads with. “We’re gonna do something great with crypto. We don’t want China, or anybody else – others are embracing it, and we want to be the head,” Trump remarked when he rang the opening trade bell in the NYSE on December 12. Trump’s criticism and contrasting vision for the economy President-elect Donald Trump, who has frequently criticized past US presidents, offered an unusually respectful tribute to Jimmy Carter following his death. On Truth Social, Trump praised Carter’s efforts to improve the lives of Americans, writing, “The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country, and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.” Donald Trump’s condolence message to Jimmy Carter’s family. Source: Truth Social However, Trump’s post-humous admiration for Carter contrasts sharply with his broader critique of Carter’s presidency. Trump has often pointed to Carter’s handling of stagflation as an example of economic mismanagement, even as he fashions his own plans to combat inflation and reduce costs for American families. Among Trump’s campaign promises is a pledge to “end inflation and make America affordable again,” a slogan that might ring familiar to those who lived through Carter’s era. Trump’s proposed solutions, however, diverge significantly from Carter’s measured approach. Trump has pledged to expand domestic energy production, including controversial plans to open the Arctic wilderness to oil drilling. He argues that this would lower energy costs, though economists remain skeptical about the long-term impact on inflation. Additionally, Trump has proposed reducing housing costs by restricting undocumented immigrants’ access to mortgages and launching a federal housing initiative. Jimmy Carter and Trump’s contrasting upbringings are on full display in their vastly different approaches to governance. Carter, born on a farm in rural Georgia, grew up without electricity or running water. He attended the US Naval Academy and later returned to his hometown to run his family’s peanut business before entering politics. Trump’s childhood was very different; he was raised in the affluent neighborhood of Jamaica Estates in Queens, New York, and inherited a real estate empire that shaped his business-centric worldview. Their presidencies further highlight their opposing philosophies. Carter’s installation of solar water-heating panels on the White House roof symbolized his commitment to renewable energy and environmental stewardship. Trump’s dismissal of climate change as a “hoax” invented by China shows he doesn’t want to employ Carter’s ethos. He’d rather do things “his way.” Jimmy Carter’s legacy of service and reflection Carter and Trump’s careers share one common thread: a profound impact on American society. Carter’s post-presidency was marked by humanitarian work through the Carter Center, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. His efforts to eradicate diseases, promote human rights, and build affordable housing have left an indelible mark on the world stage. Trump’s legacy, meanwhile, remains a work in progress. As he prepares to assume office again, his vision for America’s economy and how it will compare to the policies of past presidents like Carter is a magnet for scrutiny. Jimmy Carter’s biographer, Jonathan Alter, perhaps captured the essence of their differences best when he recalled Carter’s response to a question about similarities with Trump: a stern “No.” Jimmy Carter’s century-long life embodied a commitment to service and principle. His achievements in diplomacy and humanitarianism stand as a testament to his enduring legacy.

Despite the announcement, SHIB’s price remains in decline, down 20% over two weeks, amid broader market correction. The Upcoming Development Shiba Inu’s leading developer who uses the X moniker Shytoshi Kusama recently said they will introduce a podcast in 2025. It will consist of 44 episodes and touch upon different aspects of the entire ecosystem of the meme coin. Kusama explained that every Monday, the podcast’s topic will be meme coins, while Tuesday will be dedicated to Treat (TREAT). The token serves various purposes, including as a reward for users participating in the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s activities. Every Thursday the streaming will feature “tech talk ,” on Friday Kusama will “do shootouts and follows,” whereas Saturday will be “all about spirituality.” There will be no podcast on Wednesday and Sunday. “Next year will be epic, and I am so excited to share what we’ve built,” the developer concluded. The upcoming podcast represents another community-oriented effort. Earlier this year, Kusama and Kaal Dhairya (two of the anonymous developers of Shiba Inu) revealed they would step down by the end of 2024 and hand full control over to the SHIB Army. The former said this move aligns with their vision for true decentralization in the cryptocurrency space. SHIB Price Outlook Despite the announcement about the forthcoming development, the price of the meme coin remains in the red. It currently trades at around $0.00002165, a 3% fall on a 24-hour scale and a 20% decline in the past two weeks. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko The underperformance coincides with the broader decline of the entire cryptocurrency market since the latest FOMC meeting. Recall that Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted from over $108,000 on December 17 to its current $93,500 after America’s central bank hinted that the rate cuts might be paused in 2025 due to rising inflation concerns. One factor signaling that SHIB bulls might experience further pain in the near future is the exchange netflow . According to CryptoQuant, inflows surpassed outflows on most days last week. This suggests a shift from self-custody methods toward centralized platforms and could be viewed as a bearish factor since it increases the immediate selling pressure.

Its journey toward the $10 mark before Trump’s inauguration in January faces skepticism, primarily due to prevailing resistance levels and market conditions. While XRP garners attention for its real-world applications in trade finance, the crypto market’s dynamic nature has brought a rival altcoin into the spotlight: Rexas Finance (RXS), now priced at $0.175. XRP’s current position in the crypto market XRP has retained its status as one of the most actively traded cryptocurrencies. Its current support level is $2.1377, while resistance looms at $2.3608. Despite a stable trajectory, XRP’s ascent to $10 faces hurdles. Technical indicators like the 50-day and 100-day moving averages suggest neutral sentiment, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 48. For XRP to break into bullish territory, surpassing $2.5151 is crucial. While XRP enjoys institutional support and adoption, its upward momentum could falter under market pressures. However, XRP’s integration into the real estate and trade finance sectors continues to attract investors. Yet, the token’s slow climb leaves room for alternative investments, like RXS, that showcase faster growth potential and innovative applications. Rexas Finance’s transformative role in real-world asset tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) redefines asset ownership, enabling individuals to purchase or tokenize real-world assets like real estate, gold, and art. The global real estate market, valued at over $300 trillion, now becomes accessible through RXS. Investors can own fractional shares of properties worldwide, breaking traditional barriers of entry. A user from Asia, for instance, could invest in a European hotel, earning passive income from its operations. Beyond real estate, Rexas Finance addresses the $121.2 trillion commodity market by allowing fractional investments in resources like gold and oil. Similarly, the $65 billion global art market benefits from tokenization, enabling collectors to share ownership of high-value pieces. This revolutionary approach bridges the gap between blockchain and tangible assets. RXS empowers users through its ecosystem of tools. The Rexas Token Builder simplifies token creation for various assets, while the Rexas QuickMint Bot facilitates tokenization via Telegram and Discord. The Rexas Launchpad provides fundraising opportunities for tokenized projects, making it an all-encompassing platform for blockchain innovation. As an ERC20 token, RXS emphasizes community involvement by conducting a public presale rather than seeking venture capital. This strategy has already raised $33,427,571, with prices surging sixfold from $0.03 in Stage 1 to $0.175 in Stage 11. The token’s $1 million giveaway campaign further incentivizes participation, boosting visibility as RXS is already listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. These listings enhance legitimacy and attract widespread investor interest. Can RXS eclipse XRP’s growth? While XRP struggles to break resistance levels, RXS is carving a unique niche by addressing long-standing inefficiencies in real-world asset ownership. By leveraging blockchain, RXS provides liquidity and democratizes investments across industries. It has already gained significant traction, with 10 presale stages selling out swiftly, and its CertiK audit underscores its commitment to security and trustworthiness. RXS’s roadmap includes launching on three Tier 1 exchanges, further amplifying its accessibility. Given the platform’s robust ecosystem and rapid presale success, projections suggest RXS could hit double-digit values by early 2025. This would represent a potential 150x increase from its current price, outpacing XRP’s speculative path to $10.

The error occurred on December 19 during the mining of block 875475, which included a transaction with a fee 91,127 times higher than what was needed. Foundry Refunds Large Overpaid Bitcoin Fee After recognizing the mistake, Foundry reached out to the sender and refunded the excess fee after assessment. In a statement to The MinerMag, the mining pool assured that this refund did not affect the payouts of its regular customers stating that the payout system disregards the three highest and three lowest transaction fees each day. Its official tweet read, “We have received numerous messages from across the industry, and we want to extend our thanks to everyone who reached out on the user’s behalf. Please note that this decision was made after thorough deliberation, and we will continue to handle these instances on a case-by-case basis.” This incident marks the second such event in recent months, following a similar action by Antpool in November 2023, when it had to refund a $3 million Bitcoin transaction fee after a user error led to the highest-ever fee paid on the Bitcoin network. As reported earlier, the user mistakenly submitted 83 BTC as a fee on November 23, following which the Bitcoin mining company froze the fee temporarily, and announced its plan to verify the sender’s identity before issuing a refund. Meanwhile, Foundry’s pool, with a massive hash rate of 273.6 EH/s, remains the largest in the industry, far surpassing Antpool’s 146.7 EH/s, according to data compiled by Hashrate Index. Additionally, Foundry controls almost 38% of the market share among pool operators, while Antpool accounts for 18%, at the time of writing. Foundry Layoffs The latest development comes less than a month after Foundry was reported to have laid off 60% of its workforce, as part of its “realignment” strategy. The layoffs at Foundry mainly affected employees outside of the company’s core operations. Originally employing 250 people, 20 were reassigned to Yuma, while around 160-170 staff were let go. This included the entire ASIC repair and hardware teams, though mining pool operations remained unaffected.

38304787,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115790,1735560256,ETH Long-Term Holders Rise in 2024 as BTC Holders Decline,"ETH Long-Term Holders Rise in 2024 as BTC Holders Decline According to data from IntoTheBlock , the number of long-term Ether (ETH) holders increased significantly throughout 2024, climbing from 59% in January to 75% by December . Conversely, Bitcoin (BTC) long-term holders saw a decline, falling from 70% to 62% over the same period. This shift highlights growing investor confidence in ETH heading into 2025, driven by Ethereum’s evolving ecosystem and market dynamics. Why Are More Investors Holding ETH for the Long Term? 1. Transition to Ethereum 2.0 The successful rollout of Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) upgrades has bolstered investor confidence: Staking Rewards: Long-term holders can earn rewards by staking ETH. Reduced Supply Growth: The deflationary effects of EIP-1559 and staking withdrawals have increased ETH’s appeal as a store of value. 2. Expanding Use Cases Ethereum remains the backbone of the DeFi , NFT , and Web3 ecosystems: DeFi Boom: A growing number of decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols rely on Ethereum. Institutional Adoption: Companies and institutions increasingly see Ethereum as essential infrastructure for blockchain-based innovations. 3. Market Sentiment Bullish Outlook: Many investors anticipate further ETH price appreciation in 2025 due to its expanding utility and ecosystem growth. Why Are Bitcoin Holders Declining? 1. Profit-Taking As Bitcoin prices surged in early 2024, many long-term BTC holders likely sold their holdings to lock in profits. 2. Competition from Altcoins ETH’s rising dominance, along with the growing appeal of other Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains, may have drawn investors away from BTC. 3. Changing Narrative While Bitcoin remains a leader as a store of value , some investors are diversifying into assets with broader use cases, such as Ethereum and newer blockchain technologies. The Numbers: A Closer Look Metric January 2024 December 2024 Change ETH Long-Term Holders 59% 75% +16% BTC Long-Term Holders 70% 62% -8% What Defines a Long-Term Holder? IntoTheBlock Definition: A long-term holder is typically someone who has held the asset for over a year , indicating strong conviction and reduced likelihood of short-term trading. Implications for 2025 Ethereum’s Growing Momentum Ethereum’s expanding ecosystem positions it as a key player in blockchain innovation. Increased long-term holding indicates confidence in ETH’s future growth and stability . Bitcoin’s Market Position Despite the decline in long-term holders, Bitcoin remains a strong store of value and leader in crypto market capitalization. BTC’s digital gold narrative may attract renewed interest if macroeconomic uncertainty arises in 2025. Conclusion The rise in long-term ETH holders to 75% in 2024, coupled with the decline in long-term BTC holders , underscores a shift in market dynamics. As Ethereum solidifies its role in decentralized finance and innovation, investor confidence in ETH’s long-term potential is growing.

According to local media outlet Wenweipo , Ng believes that leveraging Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” framework to adopt Bitcoin could offer financial stability and long-term value preservation amid growing fiscal challenges. Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset 1. Fiscal Challenges in Hong Kong Deficit Concerns: Hong Kong’s fiscal deficit has surpassed 100 billion yuan ($13.7 billion) , raising concerns about financial sustainability. Role of Bitcoin: Ng argues that holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin could provide a meaningful fiscal impact. 2. Value Preservation vs. Asset Appreciation Small Holdings: A minor allocation of Bitcoin would primarily serve as a means of value preservation rather than generating significant fiscal gains. Strategic Allocation: A larger position in Bitcoin could potentially bolster asset appreciation and contribute to addressing the deficit. Leveraging the “One Country, Two Systems” Framework Ng emphasized that Hong Kong’s unique political and economic framework allows it to: Pioneer Digital Asset Adoption: Position itself as a leader in integrating digital assets into traditional financial systems. Align with Web3 Development Goals: Support Hong Kong’s broader ambitions of becoming a global hub for Web3 and blockchain innovation. Potential Benefits of Adding Bitcoin to Reserves Diversification of Reserves Bitcoin’s decentralized nature provides a hedge against traditional fiat currencies and economic uncertainties. Alignment with Global Trends Other nations and institutions, such as El Salvador and companies like MicroStrategy , have already integrated Bitcoin into their financial strategies. Attracting Global Investors A bold move to include Bitcoin in reserves could position Hong Kong as a forward-thinking financial center, attracting blockchain companies and crypto investors. Challenges and Risks Volatility Concerns Bitcoin’s price volatility could expose Hong Kong’s reserves to significant short-term risks. Regulatory Hurdles The region would need to navigate complex international regulations related to digital asset adoption. Public Perception The move might face scrutiny or resistance from stakeholders unfamiliar with the benefits of Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Conclusion Johnny Ng’s proposal to incorporate Bitcoin into Hong Kong’s foreign exchange reserves marks a bold step toward integrating digital assets into traditional financial systems. While the move presents challenges, it aligns with Hong Kong’s ambitions to lead in Web3 innovation and blockchain adoption. As the global financial landscape evolves, Hong Kong’s decision could set a precedent for other regions considering Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.

This figure, as reported by Bitcoin.com based on data from The Block , surpasses November’s total earnings of $1.21 billion , signaling a lucrative close to the year for miners. Breakdown of Revenue Sources 1. Block Rewards The majority of December’s mining revenue— $1.29 billion —came from block rewards, highlighting their continued dominance in miner earnings. 2. On-Chain Fees On-chain fees contributed an additional $37.69 million , underscoring the ongoing significance of transaction fees for miners. Key Drivers of Revenue Growth 1. High Network Activity The surge in miner earnings can be attributed to: Increased Bitcoin Transactions: A rise in trading volumes and on-chain activity, partly driven by year-end portfolio adjustments. Heightened Market Volatility: Fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price have encouraged active participation from both retail and institutional players. 2. Elevated Bitcoin Prices The sustained high price of Bitcoin has increased the value of block rewards, directly contributing to miners’ revenue. 3. Steady Hashrate Growth A robust mining infrastructure and rising network hashrate have maintained block production efficiency, ensuring miners capitalize on available rewards. Comparison with November Revenue November Revenue: $1.21 billion December Revenue (so far): $1.33 billion Increase: Approximately 10% , with two days left for further accumulation. The Role of Transaction Fees Fee Dynamics in December While transaction fees contributed $37.69 million , their share of total revenue remains modest compared to block rewards. Significance: Transaction fees typically rise during periods of network congestion and heightened trading activity. Outlook for Bitcoin Mining in 2025 Challenges Ahead Halving Event: The next Bitcoin halving, expected in 2025, will reduce block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC , potentially impacting miner profitability. Rising Difficulty: Increased mining difficulty could strain smaller operators. Opportunities Energy Innovations: Adoption of renewable energy sources could lower operational costs for miners. Institutional Investment: Continued institutional backing for Bitcoin could sustain network activity and miner revenue. Conclusion December 2024 marks a record-breaking month for Bitcoin miners, with revenues surpassing $1.33 billion , driven by strong block rewards and steady on-chain activity. As the mining industry looks toward 2025, adaptability to network changes and a focus on sustainable practices will be critical for long-term success.

In a recent 10x Market Updates report , Thielen highlighted the risk of heightened volatility in the crypto market, advising traders to tread cautiously as BTC’s recent parabolic rise could be followed by a significant pullback. Market Conditions and Inflation Report Weaker Inflation Report The report noted a weaker Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report , suggesting a slowdown in price pressures. Despite this, Federal Reserve members continue efforts to ease concerns, underscoring the complexity of current market dynamics. Market Under Pressure Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remain under pressure, reflecting cautious sentiment among investors. Factors Contributing to a Possible Bitcoin Correction 1. Parabolic Price Movement Rapid, exponential price increases in BTC are often unsustainable in the short term. Thielen suggests that such patterns frequently lead to sharp corrections as market participants lock in profits. 2. Heightened Volatility As Trump’s inauguration approaches, uncertainty around political and economic policies could contribute to increased market fluctuations. 3. Macro Concerns While easing inflation data is positive, lingering macroeconomic uncertainties and hawkish Fed policies continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Advice for Traders Thielen advises traders to: Exercise Caution: Avoid over-leveraging during periods of heightened volatility. Monitor Key Data Points: Stay updated on economic indicators and Federal Reserve announcements. Prepare for Corrections: Be ready to capitalize on potential market dips. Historical Precedents and Insights Bitcoin has often reacted to major geopolitical and macroeconomic events with significant volatility. Similar corrections have been observed following parabolic rises in: 2017: After reaching an all-time high near $20,000, BTC saw a prolonged correction. 2021: Rapid gains led to short-term pullbacks amid market speculation and regulatory concerns. Conclusion As Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, Markus Thielen’s warning serves as a reminder of the potential for heightened volatility and corrections, particularly during significant political and economic events.

38304577,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115772,1735559832,Crypto Fear & Greed Index Remains in ‘Greed’ Zone at 65,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Remains in ‘Greed’ Zone at 65 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a barometer for market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space, stands at 65 as of December 30 , indicating a continued presence in the “Greed” zone . Although the index dropped by eight points compared to the previous day, it still reflects a predominantly positive market sentiment. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by Alternative.me , measures market emotions on a scale from 0 to 100 : 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed What Contributes to the Index? The index aggregates data from six key factors, each contributing a specific percentage: Volatility (25%) : Tracks sudden price swings in the crypto market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Reflects trading activity and interest. Social Media (15%) : Monitors discussions and sentiment across platforms. Surveys (15%) : Incorporates public opinion from polls (when available). Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Measures BTC’s share of the overall crypto market. Google Trends (10%) : Analyzes search interest in crypto-related topics. Why the Drop from 73 to 65? The eight-point decline in the index may be attributed to several factors: Weakened Market Momentum: A slight decrease in trading activity has dampened market enthusiasm. Price Consolidation: After recent rallies, key cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced minor price corrections. Despite the drop, the sentiment remains in the “Greed” zone, indicating a bullish undertone. What Does This Mean for Investors? Greed Zone Implications Potential for Overvaluation: High greed levels may suggest that the market is overheated, leading to overvalued assets. FOMO Risk: Fear of missing out can drive irrational buying behavior, increasing market volatility. Caution Amid Greed While greed signals optimism, investors should exercise caution: Evaluate Fundamentals: Assess the intrinsic value of assets before buying. Diversify Investments: Avoid putting all funds into a single asset, especially during periods of heightened greed. Recent Trends in Fear & Greed Historical Perspective Extreme Fear to Greed Transitions: Periods of extreme fear often precede market rebounds, while sustained greed can lead to corrections. Current Sentiment: The index’s position at 65 suggests a maturing rally but calls for vigilance as greed persists. Market Outlook With the index fluctuating within the “Greed” zone, the crypto market could see continued bullish activity, albeit with increased risk of short-term pullbacks. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s current position at 65 highlights a prevailing optimistic sentiment in the market. However, the slight dip from 73 reflects caution among some investors. As the market remains in the “Greed” zone , traders should balance opportunities with risk management to navigate potential volatility effectively.

38304576,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115770,1735559748,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High at 109.78 T,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High at 109.78 T Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has reached a new all-time high of 109.78 T following a 1.16% adjustment at block height 876,960 , as per data from CloverPool . The adjustment occurred at 21:55 UTC on December 29 , underscoring the increasing competition among miners and the growing robustness of the Bitcoin network. The next difficulty adjustment, expected in approximately 14 days , is predicted to bring a slight increase of 0.26% , potentially setting the level at 110.07 T . What is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty? Mining difficulty is a measure of how challenging it is for miners to solve the cryptographic puzzles needed to validate Bitcoin transactions and add them to the blockchain. Key Points About Mining Difficulty: Dynamic Adjustment: The Bitcoin network adjusts difficulty every 2,016 blocks (~2 weeks) to maintain a consistent block production time of 10 minutes . Influence of Hashrate: A higher hashrate—representing more computing power—leads to higher difficulty, ensuring the network remains secure and decentralized. The Significance of 109.78 T Historical Context The 109.78 T difficulty level represents the highest in Bitcoin’s history, highlighting the network’s continuous growth and resilience. Increased Mining Competition As mining difficulty rises: Profit Margins Tighten: Miners must invest in more efficient hardware and access cheaper energy to remain profitable. Network Security Improves: Higher difficulty means more computational power is needed to compromise the network, enhancing its security. Next Difficulty Adjustment and Outlook Predicted Adjustment The next adjustment, due in about 14 days, is anticipated to bring a modest increase of 0.26% , setting the difficulty level at approximately 110.07 T . Impact on Miners Efficiency Challenges: Smaller mining operations may face additional pressure to remain competitive. Industrial Miners Benefit: Large-scale operations with advanced equipment and low-cost energy sources are better positioned to thrive. What Drives Rising Mining Difficulty? Increased Hashrate: As more miners join the network, the collective computational power increases, pushing up difficulty. Bitcoin’s Popularity: Growing adoption and rising prices incentivize more mining activity. Technological Advancements: The development of efficient mining hardware has made it possible to handle higher difficulty levels. Current Market and Industry Sentiment Bitcoin’s rising mining difficulty comes amid a period of strong institutional and retail interest in the cryptocurrency. While the increased difficulty reflects the network’s strength, it also underscores the challenges faced by miners operating in a highly competitive environment. Conclusion The new mining difficulty milestone of 109.78 T is a testament to Bitcoin’s resilience and growing network strength. As mining competition intensifies, the upcoming adjustment may bring slight changes, but the long-term trajectory points to sustained growth in the network’s robustness and security.

38304513,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115767,1735559671,Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Rally Amid Low Exchange Inflows and Increased Outflows,"Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Rally Amid Low Exchange Inflows and Increased Outflows Bitcoin (BTC) may be poised for an upward trend as on-chain indicators signal tightening supply on crypto exchanges. According to a CryptoQuant post by analyst AxelAdlerJr , recent data shows daily Bitcoin inflows to exchanges have hit approximately 30,000 BTC —levels last seen in 2016. Historically, such low inflow activity preceded significant Bitcoin rallies, raising hopes for another potential bull run. Key Indicators Supporting a BTC Rally 1. Low Exchange Inflows Current Levels: Exchanges are seeing daily BTC deposits of 30,000 BTC, reminiscent of the 2016 record lows. Market Implication: A reduction in Bitcoin deposits to exchanges indicates less selling pressure, which could tighten supply in the spot market. 2. Increased Exchange Outflows Netflow-to-Reserve Ratio: A negative ratio suggests Bitcoin is leaving exchanges at a faster rate than it is being deposited. Historical Context: Similar outflows have historically coincided with the end of bear markets , setting the stage for price recoveries. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Price? Reduced Spot Market Supply The outflows and reduced inflows suggest that Bitcoin is being moved to long-term storage or wallets, reducing the amount of BTC available for immediate trading. Bullish Historical Patterns 2016 Example: A similar period of low exchange inflows preceded a major Bitcoin rally. Bear Market Cycles: Historically, exchange outflows have marked turning points in bearish cycles, leading to eventual price recoveries. Speculative Environment While these metrics indicate potential bullish momentum, they don’t guarantee immediate price increases. Market dynamics, macroeconomic factors, and investor sentiment will play significant roles in shaping Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Expert Commentary AxelAdlerJr notes, “Although past performance is not always indicative of future results, these patterns point to a potential shortage of BTC in the market, which could set the stage for a rally.” Other analysts echo similar sentiments, suggesting that continued accumulation by long-term holders could limit BTC’s availability, fueling upward price pressure over time. Current Market Sentiment Indicators to Watch: BTC Price Levels: Traders should monitor Bitcoin’s ability to hold key support levels and break resistance zones. Institutional Activity: Increased institutional interest, coupled with tightening supply, could further strengthen BTC’s price action. Macro Factors: Interest rates, inflation, and regulatory developments will impact broader crypto market sentiment. Conclusion The combination of low Bitcoin inflows , increased outflows , and tightening supply on exchanges highlights a potentially bullish setup for Bitcoin. While not a guarantee of immediate price movement, these indicators suggest that BTC could be on the brink of a significant rally, especially if historical trends hold true.

What It Means for Ripple, XRP, and Crypto Regulation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The big question of who will lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Donald Trump’s presidency has finally been answered. President-elect Trump has nominated Paul Atkins , a former SEC commissioner known for his pro-crypto views, as the next SEC Chair. While this has sparked hope in the crypto community, investors are eager to see how Atkins will handle ongoing crypto cases like Ripple’s. Atkins has consistently supported fair and transparent regulations that encourage crypto innovation while safeguarding progress in the industry. Are we finally headed for better days? Crypto Analyst Weighs In Crypto analyst Arthur (@XrpArthur) took to X (formerly Twitter) to share why Atkins’ nomination could be transformative for Ripple, XRP, and the broader crypto industry. Arthur highlighted that Atkins’ leadership might bring an end to years of regulatory uncertainty, particularly in high-profile cases like Ripple vs. SEC. Why Paul Atkins nominated by Donald Trump to succeed Gary Gensler is GREAT news for Ripple, XRP, and the entire crypto industry! Here is a THREAD to help you convince your friends to buy XRP on New Year's Eve pic.twitter.com/ZVRT7yHh4d — Arthur (@XrpArthur) December 29, 2024 During Gary Gensler’s tenure as SEC Chair , the agency was often criticized for its aggressive approach toward crypto companies. This included an extended legal battle with Ripple Labs, which negatively impacted XRP’s price and deterred new entrants from the market. The ongoing lawsuit, one of the most high-profile cases in the crypto world, has created an environment of fear and hesitation among investors and startups alike. A New SEC Under Paul Atkins? Paul Atkins is expected to bring a more pragmatic and supportive approach to crypto regulation. His priority will likely be to close regulatory loopholes and introduce policies that encourage growth and innovation in the crypto sector. Trump’s decision to nominate Atkins at this critical juncture is seen as a strategic move to rebuild investor confidence in the U.S. crypto market. Ripple, in particular, has reason to be optimistic. If Atkins assumes office, his leadership could expedite the resolution of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. A faster settlement would clear XRP of its legal troubles, making it more attractive to institutional investors who have been waiting for regulatory clarity before committing to the asset. What Could This Mean for XRP? Under Atkins’ leadership, XRP could experience a wave of positive developments: Enhanced Legitimacy: Clearer regulations would give XRP stronger credibility in the U.S. market, encouraging both institutional and retail investors to adopt the token. Institutional Adoption: Legal clarity could remove barriers for large-scale investors, potentially driving significant capital into XRP. Ripple’s Expansion: Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which leverages XRP for cross-border payments, could see widespread adoption as businesses and financial institutions gain confidence in the token’s legal standing. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Here’s Why You Should Be Bullish on XRP Even As It Struggles at $2 , A Brighter Future for Crypto?

38304322,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399481,1735559220,XRP ETF Likely in 2025? Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit Reaches Critical Turning Point,"The post XRP ETF Likely in 2025? Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit Reaches Critical Turning Point appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP community is eagerly awaiting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appeal deadline on January 15, 2025. This date could play a crucial role in determining XRP’s future and its chances of securing an exchange-traded fund (ETF). In November, the SEC requested an extension to file its appeal by early January, sparking speculation that the delay was tied to the U.S. election results. ApA New Direction for the SEC? With a pro-crypto Trump administration set to take office and Paul Atkins expected to lead the SEC, doubts are growing about whether the agency will pursue the appeal. This change in leadership could signal a turning point for Ripple and the broader crypto market. The appeal will continue for now, and that process takes about a year. But there is the possibility that a new administration decides to move to dismiss the appeal. That's not something I recall happening before, but it's possible and maybe likely. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) December 22, 2024 Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer , Stuart Alderoty, has urged the incoming administration to end the SEC’s four-year legal battle with Ripple. He believes a crypto-friendly SEC chair like Atkins could restore trust in the industry and bring much-needed regulatory clarity. XRP Approval On the Way? If the SEC drops its appeal, it could clarify XRP’s classification as a non-security, significantly boosting its chances for ETF approval—a milestone the crypto community has been waiting for. So far, only Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have received approval, as these assets are not classified as securities. Hopes are high that the new administration will approve several altcoin ETFs in 2025 , including Solana and XRP. Companies like Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree have already submitted XRP ETF proposals. Prediction platform Polymarket currently estimates a 75% chance of an XRP ETF being approved in 2025. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why XRP Price is Going Down Today & What to Expect Next? , Bullish Outlook Will XRP Prices Soar? The market sentiment among XRP holders is optimistic, with expectations of a rally fueled by either an ETF approval or the anticipated 2025 altcoin season. Analysts predict that an approved ETF could push XRP’s price above $5, making the wait worthwhile for investors. Adding to this bullish outlook, crypto analyst Lark Davis recently shared an optimistic market forecast on X (formerly Twitter). The crypto market is headed towards a $10T market cap. And when that happens, it will unleash mind-blowing gains that most people can't even fathom. — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 28, 2024 .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38304056,https://finbold.com/?p=224138,1735558691,"Dogecoin could surge by 6,770%, says expert","Although most of the year was relatively sluggish, 2024 is set to close as a positive year on the whole for the cryptocurrency market. After three-quarters of sideways trading, digital assets saw a significant surge beginning in early November. While leading cryptos like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) benefitted, numerous altcoins and meme coins saw returns just as good — if not better, than their largest counterparts. That was certainly the case for the O.G. meme coin — Dogecoin ( DOGE ). At the beginning of the year, DOGE was trading at approximately $0.092. By early November, the price of Dogecoin had risen to $0.15, marking an impressive 63.04% rise. Following that, DOGE experienced an even more pronounced upswing — all thanks to Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk . A longtime proponent of Dogecoin, Musk’s close alliance with President-elect Donald Trump, as well as the announcement of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) served to buoy investor trust in the humorous asset. By December 8, DOGE had reached prices close to $0.47 — a mark equating to a 414% gain on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. Since then, the meme coin has seen prices decrease by a little more than 32%, and was trading at $0.32 at press time — but one technical analyst thinks that a massive 6,770% surge might be in the cards for DOGE in the months ahead. Dogecoin price YTD chart. Source: Finbold Can DOGE hit $22.11? Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez shared a chart detailing an ascending parallel channel pattern that DOGE has been in for more than a decade, as detailed in a December 30 post on social media platform X. While the channel is rather ambitiously plotted and steep, DOGE’s past price action has shown a pattern of rejection when racing either channel line. Martinez stated that if Dogecoin continues to follow the pattern, it could see prices surge by as much as 6,770% — a figure that equates to a price of roughly $22.11. #Dogecoin $DOGE could rally by another 6,770% if it continues to follow the ascending parallel channel pattern! pic.twitter.com/Js9mYGwevK — Ali (@ali_charts) December 30, 2024 At a price of $22.11, with a total supply of 147.41 billion DOGE, the meme coin’s market capitalization would be somewhere in the ballpark of $3.26 trillion — making it the 7th largest asset in the world, ahead of Bitcoin and silver. As enticing as this thesis is, it is based solely on technical analysis. The issuance of 5 billion DOGE per year provides steady inflationary pressure which serves as a headwind for positive price action . On top of that, just a couple of days ago, Martinez set a much more attainable price target of $4, along with a more detailed analysis. Other experts, like Trader Tardigrade , who forecast an upswing to $2, also see a large degree of upside for DOGE — Martinez’s 6,770% upside, unfortunately, appears to be a rather fringe opinion.

38305123,https://thecoinrise.com/hyperliquid-opens-native-staking-for-hype-token-holders-details/,1735558507,HyperLiquid Opens Native Staking for HYPE Token Holders: Details,"HyperLiquid, a decentralized perpetual trading platform and Layer-1 blockchain known for its decentralized derivatives exchange, has introduced native staking for its HYPE token holders. The move, which was announced via a post on X on Monday, allows users to stake their tokens and earn rewards for helping secure the network. This development marks another milestone in the platform’s rapidly growing ecosystem, which has already gained significant attention in the crypto community. 300 Million Tokens Staked at Launch At the time of launch, HyperLiquid staked a substantial 300 million HYPE tokens, valued at $8.4 billion, with additional contributions from users. In the first hour alone, another 7 million tokens were staked, highlighting the strong demand for this new feature. The tokens are distributed across 16 validators, with each validator offering users a chance to select where their staked tokens will go. While the staked tokens are bound by a vesting schedule, the rewards earned from staking will remain locked, ensuring that users continue to participate in securing the network for an extended period. This development follows a month after the HYPE token’s debut . Initially priced at $3.57, the token has seen impressive growth, reaching $27.89 as of now. With a current market cap of $9.2 billion, HYPE has surged into the top 20 largest tokens, surpassing competitors such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Pepe (PEPE), and Litecoin (LTC). HyperLiquid Soars Amid Controversy HyperLiquid’s trading platform has also seen remarkable success, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.64 billion. According to DefiLlama, the platform generates more than $1 million in daily revenue, further solidifying its position as a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. However, the platform has not been without its challenges. Recently, HyperLiquid became embroiled in controversy after blockchain security researcher Taylor Monahan alleged that North Korean-backed cyber actors were operating on the platform. This accusation, shared via an X post, led to a massive outflow of funds from the HYPE token and caused waves throughout the crypto community. Despite this setback, HyperLiquid continues to push forward, with its staking feature seen as a positive step for the platform’s future growth. As the crypto space continues to evolve, HyperLiquid’s future could very well depend on how it navigates regulatory challenges and bolsters user trust.

Meanwhile, the crypto market buzzes with excitement over iDEGEN , a new memecoin that has successfully raised over $10.6 million in presale, promising dynamic pricing and AI-driven community engagement. Hong Kong and Germany eye strategic Bitcoin reserves The race to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves is heating up with Hong Kong and Germany joining the fray. In Hong Kong, legislators are pushing for the integration of Bitcoin into the city’s Exchange Fund, leveraging its “One Country, Two Systems” policy. Wu Jiezhuang, Chairman of Hong Kong’s Web3 Virtual Asset Development Subcommittee, has suggested this move could help maintain financial security in a volatile crypto market. Hong Kong’s crypto-friendly environment is further highlighted by its listing of 12 cryptocurrency-linked ETFs, valued at HK$7.4 billion, indicating its readiness to embrace digital assets. There’s also speculation that Hong Kong might convert China’s reported 190,000 Bitcoin holdings into ETFs, which could significantly impact the local and global crypto markets. In Germany, former Finance Minister Christian Lindner has called for the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bundesbank to consider Bitcoin reserves. This proposal comes as a response to the US’s recent policy shifts under the new Trump administration, where there’s talk of including cryptocurrencies in national reserves. Lindner has emphasized that Europe should not lag in this crypto race, suggesting a potential examination of crypto assets as part of central bank reserves in Frankfurt. This global movement towards Bitcoin reserves isn’t limited to these regions; even Russia is contemplating similar measures amidst international sanctions, while Japan, for now, has decided against it. The US has also seen states proposing to hold a portion of their reserves in Bitcoin, with Wyoming’s Senator Cynthia Lummis vocal about accumulating over 1 million Bitcoins for a national strategic reserve. iDEGEN: the new memecoin set to list on exchanges in January 2025 As nations contemplate launching strategic Bitocin reserves, iDEGEN is emerging as a notable player in the meme coin sector. Launched on November 26, 2024, it has already raised over $10.6 million in its presale phase, selling more than 1.131 billion tokens. At the heart of the current hype around the memecoin is that it employs a unique pricing strategy where prices adjust every five minutes based on market activity, potentially offering a 5% price swing. This model is particularly appealing to traders who enjoy navigating volatile markets. Besides the ongoing dynamic presale, iDEGEN uses AI to adapt based on community feedback on X, fostering a more interactive and responsive environment. This not only enhances community loyalty but also positions iDEGEN as more than just a speculative asset. With an expected listing price 10% above the final presale price, early investors are looking at immediate gains. Speculation is rife that iDEGEN could achieve up to 10x gains by the end of the first quarter of 2025, fueled by its current momentum and the shift in investor interest away from traditional cryptocurrencies facing regulatory issues.

It was created by former contributors to Diem, Meta’s blockchain project.

Its focus on speed and lower costs makes it an interesting option in the current blockchain market.

Kaspa Cryptocurrency: A High-Speed PoW Blockchain with GHOSTDAG Protocol Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, it allows blocks created simultaneously to coexist and organizes them in consensus. Kaspa operates on a blockDAG structure, enabling fast and secure transactions with short confirmation times driven by network speed.

Key features include DAG topology queries, block data pruning, SPV proofs, and upcoming subnetwork support for layer 2 solutions. These aspects make Kaspa stand out in its potential for scalability and efficiency. Its technology and roadmap may make it appealing during this phase of the market cycle. Sui Blockchain and Its Potential in the Crypto Market Sui is a layer-1 blockchain designed for global adoption with a focus on scalability, security, and ease of use.

The coin’s potential will depend on continued adoption and its ability to deliver on its promises.

Table of Contents Recent audits cement Rollblock as a premier GameFi opportunity Elon Musk spearheads renewed Dogecoin excitement Shiba Inu’s momentum pauses amid correction Get in early to Rollblock to maximize ROI After experiencing a parabolic year overall, meme coins have arguably been the hardest-hit sector during this recent market crash. However, established entities such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are usually less impacted by rampant volatility, which is why they are suitable options for investors seeking relatively low-risk meme coins. Of course, this also means less potential ROI. For those seeking returns in the 10-100x ballpark, Rollblock is widely considered a superior opportunity, given its massive hype potential and impressive fundamentals in the GameFi sector. Read on to learn more about RBLK’s bullish position during its tentative presale. Recent audits cement Rollblock as a premier GameFi opportunity Rollblock is redefining the GameFi sector with its smart platform, offering a diverse library of over 7,000 games, including fan favorites like blackjack and poker, as well as exclusive blockchain-based titles. Its recent addition of sports betting features has significantly expanded its appeal, contributing to its rapidly growing community of over 30,000 users. Security and transparency are at the forefront of Rollblock’s operations, with advanced encryption and AI technology safeguarding users and their funds. Recently audited by SolidProof and licensed by Gaming Anjouan, Rollblock upholds stringent compliance standards, positioning itself as a reliable player in the GameFi industry during the current bull market. The RBLK token is central to Rollblock’s ecosystem, enabling its dynamic play-to-earn model and incentivizing user engagement. A key highlight is its revenue-sharing system, which allocates 30% of weekly profits for token buybacks, burns half to reduce supply and distributes the rest as staking rewards. This model ensures token stability and also cultivates a loyal and engaged community of players and investors, solidifying Rollblock’s long-term growth prospects.

38303376,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399902,1735557217,Top 10 DePIN Coins to Invest in 2025: A Complete Analysis,"The post Top 10 DePIN Coins to Invest in 2025: A Complete Analysis appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) is emerging as one of the most promising trends in crypto for 2025. By integrating blockchain technology with physical infrastructure, DePIN projects are offering unique advantages for both consumers and producers, catching the eye of innovators and investors alike. This article highlights the top 10 DePIN coins to watch in 2025. These tokens stand out due to their strong market capitalizations and promising price trends, making them noteworthy players in this evolving sector. The Top 10 DePIN Coins Helium (HNT) HNT, the native token of Helium, is one of the top DePIN crypto projects consistently gaining attention from traders and long-term holders, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. This growing interest and confidence in the asset are not only due to the quality of the crypto project but also the formation of a bullish price action pattern. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, HNT has formed a bullish harami candlestick pattern on the crucial 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame. Additionally, the altcoin appears to be consolidating within a tight range between $5.9 and $8.5. Based on the recent price action, there is a strong possibility that HNT could surge by 30% to reach the upper boundary of the consolidation zone at $8.5. However, as the price is near the support level, it could decline and find support around $5.9 in the coming days, potentially propelling the asset upward thereafter. Filecoin (FIL) FIL, the native token of Filecoin , is poised for significant upside momentum due to the formation of a bullish price action pattern on the daily time frame. Over the past few days, FIL has experienced a price decline of more than 40% but has recently paused its downward trajectory. This pause has been observed as the price finds support from a golden Fibonacci area, the 200 EMA, and a crucial horizontal level at the $4.90 mark. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, if FIL maintains its position above the $4.90 level, it is highly likely to rally by 65% and reach the $8.15 level in the near future. This top-tier asset, backed by strong bullish price action, solidifies its position as one of the top 10 DePIN coins. Theta Network (THETA) Theta (THETA), a popular and leading DePIN crypto project, has faced challenges since the beginning of December 2024 but currently appears bullish and poised for significant upside momentum. Amid the ongoing price correction, THETA has formed a descending triangle price action pattern on the daily time frame and is struggling to break out of this pattern. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if THETA breaks out of the pattern and closes a daily candle above the $2.45 level, there is a strong likelihood it could rally by 36% to reach the $3.30 mark in the coming days. Internet Computer (ICP) Amid market uncertainty, ICP, the native token of Internet Computer, has experienced a 35% price decline but has found support at the 200 EMA and a critical Fibonacci area, similar to Theta Network’s THETA coin. This support from technical indicators suggests a bullish outlook for the ICP token. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if ICP maintains its position above the $9.5 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 55% to reach the $15.45 mark in the coming days. With the current price movement, ICP has created an ideal trading opportunity with a 1.9:5 risk-to-reward ratio. IOTA (IOTA) Following the presidential election results , IOTA has gained widespread attention from crypto enthusiasts due to its impressive upside momentum. According to CoinMarketCap data, the token has surged more than 540%. However, amid market uncertainty, the altcoin appears to be struggling and has experienced a price correction of over 54% in the past few days. Source: Trading View It appears that IOTA has currently found support at a crucial 61.85% Fibonacci level, suggesting a potential price recovery in the coming days. Based on recent price action, if the altcoin holds above the $0.28 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by at least 35% to reach the next resistance level at $0.40 in the future . Render (RENDER) Amid market uncertainty, similar to IOTA and other DePIN coins, RENDER has found support at a crucial horizontal level of $6.80, the 61.85% Fibonacci area, and the 200 EMA. In addition to this support, RENDER is poised for a breakout from a key trendline that it has been facing since the beginning of December 2024. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if RENDER breaks the trendline and closes a daily candle above the $7.22 level, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 60% to reach the resistance level at $11.60 in the future. With substantial support and bullish price action, RENDER is one of the top DePIN coins with the potential to skyrocket once market sentiment shifts. Arweave (AR) AR, the native token of Arweave, has been struggling since the beginning of December 2024. However, the asset’s price has been consolidating in a tight range between $15.90 and $18 for the past few days. Based on recent price action, if AR breaks out of the consolidation zone and closes a daily candle above the $18 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 50% to reach the $28 mark in the coming days. Akash Network (AKT) Amid ongoing market uncertainty, AKT, the native token of Akash Network, has experienced a price decline of over 40% and is currently trading at a discounted level. However, the price action shows that AKT’s continuous decline halted at a crucial support level of $2.85. Source: Trading View Historically, whenever the asset’s price reaches this support level, it experiences upside momentum. This time, experts and analysts are expecting a similar rally. Based on recent price action, if AKT holds above the $2.85 level, it is highly probable that it will surge by 60% to reach the $4.75 mark in the future. AIOZ Network (AIOZ) AIOZ Network’s AIOZ token appears to be struggling at a crucial support level of $0.82. Technical indicators identify this level as a golden Fibonacci area, where investors and traders seem to be accumulating the asset, creating buying pressure. Source: Trading View Based on technical analysis, if AIOZ holds above $0.82, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 55% to reach the $1.28 mark in the coming days. Hivemapper (HONEY) HONEY, the native token of Hivemapper, is poised for notable upside momentum, as it has recently broken out of a trendline it has been facing since the beginning of December 2024. Following this breakout, the asset reached a crucial resistance level at the $0.09 mark, where it is currently experiencing a price decline. Based on recent price action, if HONEY breaks this resistance level and closes a daily candle above $0.09, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 50% to reach the $0.14 mark in the future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

ETF Analyst Explains!,"With only two days left until the end of 2024, this year has been a year of significant turning points for Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies. Chief among these events was undoubtedly the US SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and spot Ethereum ETFs in May. While Bitcoin ETFs have been rocked by huge inflows, Etheruem ETFs have failed to perform as expected. However, ETF Store President Nate Geraci said that 2024 will be a year of significant success for crypto ETFs. Nate Geraci noted the growing dominance of crypto-focused ETFs, saying that among the 740 ETFs launched in 2024, cryptocurrency ETFs took the top eight spots in terms of inflows. Geraci said that of the top eight ETFs, four are spot Bitcoin ETFs, two are spot Ethereum ETFs, and the other two are two ETFs tracking MicroStrategy (MSTR). According to the analyst's post, the top two ETFs that attracted attention were BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC ETF, followed by BlackRock's Ethereum ETF ETHA. Nate Geraci stated in another post that Solana spot ETFs are expected to receive approval in 2025 after Trump takes office.

38303586,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634731,1735557044,Bitcoin spot ETFs shed $388M in weekly outflows while Ethereum ETFs gain $349M,"Bitcoin spot ETFs shed almost $388 million in weekly outflows between December 23 and 27. On the other hand, Ethereum realized a $349M net inflow over the same period. Although Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a significant shed, Fidelity’s FBTC stood out with a noteworthy weekly flow of $183 million. The mixed performance within the Bitcoin ETFs makes it difficult to assess investor mood during Christmas. Following the shed, Bitcoin spot ETFs net asset value is $106.683 billion. The latest outflows show that investors could be replanning their holdings due to market uncertainties compared to the past inflow periods. Only a few ETFs, like Fidelity’s FBTC, displayed resilience, posting gains throughout the period. Ethereum ETFs surged as investors pivot toward ETH’s promising ecosystem While Bitcoin ETFs saw serious outflows, Ethereum spot ETFs ran in the opposite direction, realizing inflows of almost $349 million from December 23 to December 27. BlackRock’s ETHA took the lead in this upward trend, amassing a weekly inflow of $182 million. Fidelity’s FETH came second with $160 million in inflows. The upward trend highlights investor curiosity in digital assets based on ETH. Ethereum ETFs have remained steady and vibrant for several weeks, maintaining positive inflows. Compared to Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum ETFs are proving supremacy in drawing both institutional and individual investors. Some top traders, such as Eugene Ng, clarified that institutional interest in ETH is not a new concept. Eugene holds that ETH’s performance will stand out from BTC’s due to its welcoming ecosystem. The trend will be upheld due to the rise in flexibility. Eugene also predicts that ETH will be one of the best-performing assets in the first quarter of 2025. ETH could pump in Q1 2025 Ether has the potential to rally in the first quarter of 2025. However, analysts warn that the macro climate within the crypto ecosystem might slow the market’s speed. One key growth area for Ether could be spot Ether exchange-traded funds, which have seen inflows for over 20 consecutive days, driving up to $2.5 billion to Fairside investors. Crypto hedge fund ZX Squared Capital’s chief investment officer also said inflows should “dramatically” increase in 2025: We expect the inflows will dramatically increase in 2025 when the new Trump administration issues more crypto-friendly rules and regulations to further boost the digital asset class in general . ~ CK Zheng From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-spot-etfs-shed-388-m-in-outflows/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38303586.jpeg

This key price point has acted as a stronghold for the cryptocurrency during its recent ascent, but now, the market is facing mounting pressure. Bearish strength is starting to gain traction, raising concerns that the $93,257 level might soon give way to further declines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is beginning to show signs of weakness, suggesting that momentum is shifting in favor of the bears. If Bitcoin fails to hold this support, it could trigger a wave of sell-offs, pushing the price toward lower support levels. However, if the bulls step in and defend this level, it might provide a foundation for a fresh rally and reinforce the strength of the ongoing uptrend. As Bitcoin tests this critical threshold, the next few days will be pivotal in determining its short-term trajectory. Will the bulls manage to regain control, or will the bears take charge and force a breakdown? This moment could set the tone for Bitcoin’s price action in the coming weeks, making it a crucial point to watch closely. RSI Signals Weakness: A Red Flag For Bitcoin? The Relative Strength Index is flashing a warning sign for Bitcoin as it shows signs of weakening strength. This technical indicator, which measures the strength and speed of price movements, has long been a reliable tool for predicting potential trend reversals. Currently, Bitcoin’s RSI is trending below 50%, indicating that the buying pressure is beginning to fade. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retests Support Line After Crash Below $95,000, Here’s The Next Target A weakening RSI suggests that Bitcoin could be losing its upward momentum, even though the price may not reflect this shift immediately. As Bitcoin approaches the $93,257 key support level, this divergence may be a precursor to a possible breakdown. If Bitcoin’s RSI continues to decline, it might signal that the market is overextended and that further downside pressure might be on the horizon. A drop below this support mark could confirm this shift in momentum, leading to a deeper pullback. What Happens If $93,257 Breaks? Potential Impact On BTC’s Price If the critical $93,257 support level breaks, it could unleash significant downward movement, potentially driving the price toward the $85,211 support zone. A breach of this level would likely trigger a wave of selling activity, pushing Bitcoin down to the $73,919 support area, which could serve as the next key point of defense. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Enters Correction Phase On Its Path To Explode Above $110,000 However, If the bulls successfully defend the $93,257 support, Bitcoin might regain momentum and continue its upward trend, aiming for the $99,575 resistance.

38302994,https://finbold.com/?p=224123,1735556413,Will Tesla accept Bitcoin payments in 2025 as BTC goes 56% green,"The 2024 – and, hopefully, the 2025 – cryptocurrency bull market is appearing increasingly likely to, along with Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) stellar performance, bring back another development from 2021: Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA ) acceptance of BTC payments. Specifically, Elon Musk’s electric vehicle ( EV ) maker made its initial investment in the world’s premier cryptocurrency in January 2021 and announced it would begin accepting it as payment in March of the same year but reneged just one month later. At the time, the South African-Canadian-American billionaire revealed Tesla would reconsider the decision once Bitcoin mining is more than 50% fueled by clean energy. Musk reveals that Tesla ‘will resume’ accepting Bitcoin once BTC mining is at least 50% sustainable. Source: @elonmusk In December 2024, such a situation not only emerged but turned decisive as BTC’s green energy share exceeded 56%. Why Tesla is unlikely to reconsider Bitcoin payments over green energy In the current climate of BTC aiming for new all-time highs (ATH) – despite the late December downturn – and multiple companies benefitting from investing in or owning the cryptocurrency, Tesla’s return to digital assets transaction could help its already-strong rally. Still, it remains uncertain if Elon Musk will truly reconsider Bitcoin payments at this stage. Indeed, data retrieved from WooCharts on December 30 reveals that the coin crossed the 50% threshold already in 2022. Bitcoin price and green energy usage chart. Source: WooCharts Furthermore, despite what its industry might suggest, there is room for doubt about the actual energy sustainability of Tesla Motors itself. Despite the vehicles themselves being ‘green’ in the sense they don’t burn fossil fuels, many skeptics have made the argument that EVs can only be as green as global electricity production is. Indeed, data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) reveals that by 2023, fossil fuels accounted for 49.2% of electricity production in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. If recent trends continued, the share could have decreased to between 45% and 49%, but it could have also remained level or even slightly increased by press time. Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that Russia, China, India, as well as most Asian, South American, and African countries, are not part of the OECD. Finally, some critics have cast doubt on the actual ‘greenness’ of the EV industry as a whole – and, thus, on Tesla Motors itself – due to its use of lithium batteries. Lithium mining is notoriously ‘dirty’ with 2024 technologies and is generally confined to remote and desert areas. The potential damage from the extraction of the mineral is highlighted in a 2024 study published in Nature that describes the risks to Serbia’s water supply and agricultural land that would emerge should Rio Tinto’s (ASX: RIO) project Jadar be set into motion. What could drive Tesla to reconsider Bitcoin payments in 2025 Ultimately, Tesla’s decision about Bitcoin transactions is more likely to be based on the cryptocurrency’s performance and the Trump administration’s policy approach toward digital assets. While some firms – Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) being the prime example) – they have continued investing in Bitcoin, but similar activity has somewhat died down as BTC began facing late December headwinds. Indeed, after experiencing a remarkable climb from the range between $67,000 and $67,000 at the start of November to ATH above $108,000 in mid-December, Bitcoin experienced something of a plunge in more recent weeks and is trading at $93,574 at press time on the penultimate day of the year.

38305926,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323320,1735556394,Hong Kong Legislator Proposes Adding Bitcoin to National Reserves for Financial Security,"Hong Kong legislator Wu Jiexhuang has proposed leveraging the city’s “one country, two systems” framework to include Bitcoin in its national reserves, aiming to bolster financial security. Speaking to state-owned newspaper Wen Wei Po , Jiexhuang suggested Hong Kong should study the impact of U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the market as a preliminary step. Drawing comparisons to nations like El Salvador and Bhutan, which have integrated Bitcoin into their reserves, and certain U.S. states, Jiexhuang highlighted the growing global acceptance of Bitcoin. He also referenced U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to classify Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Legislator Advocates for Bitcoin ETFs as a Gateway to National Reserves Jiexhuang urged Hong Kong authorities to explore including Bitcoin in ETFs as a first move, which could later pave the way for increased Bitcoin holdings. He argued that such a step would attract talent and investment, reinforce financial stability, and mitigate market disruptions caused by Bitcoin’s broader adoption. By acting early, Hong Kong could secure a competitive edge in the global financial landscape. The legislator emphasized that holding Bitcoin in reserves could stabilize its value as more countries adopt it, reducing reliance on traditional assets. “If major economic powers include Bitcoin in their strategic reserves, its value will stabilize, encouraging others to follow suit. This could reduce traditional asset holdings, potentially impacting fiscal reserves tied to those assets,” Jiexhuang stated. The report also noted that Hong Kong’s Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau plans to regulate cryptocurrencies under the principle of “same business, same risks, same rules.” China, which currently holds 190,000 Bitcoin through confiscations, ranks second globally in Bitcoin reserves, following the United States. In mid-2024, Hong Kong legislator Johnny Ng announced efforts to explore Bitcoin’s potential role in the region’s reserves.

In contrast, Hong Kong’s efforts to position itself as a crypto-friendly financial center have lagged. The city has issued only seven platform licenses, with four being restricted approvals granted in December. Regulatory hurdles and a slower approval process have made Hong Kong less attractive for crypto firms. Prominent exchanges like OKX and Bybit have withdrawn their applications in Hong Kong, citing regulatory challenges. Hong Kong’s stricter rules, allowing trading only in highly liquid cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, further limit its appeal by excluding smaller altcoins that provide broader market opportunities. Additionally, China’s strict stance on cryptocurrency trading adds to Hong Kong’s unique challenges. The mainland’s blanket ban on crypto trading creates a distinct risk profile, deterring some businesses from pursuing opportunities in the city. Recently, Hong Kong Legislative Council member voiced criticism against Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency licensing system, citing its impact on market confidence. The lawmarker attributed the withdrawals to the requirement imposed by the Hong Kong SFC, which requires applicants for virtual asset trading platform licenses to commit to not having mainland Chinese users in any region.

38303035,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634727,1735556130,Trump snaps over Biden’s US debt ceiling extension in 2023,"Donald Trump unleashed a verbal nuke on Joe Biden and his administration over their handling of the U.S. debt ceiling last year. On Truth Social, Trump called the decision to extend the debt ceiling “one of the dumbest political moves in years.” According to him, Biden dumped an economic grenade into Republican hands, making a disaster that should have been Biden’s problem now a Republican mess. “There was no reason to do it—NOTHING WAS GAINED,” Trump wrote. He tagged Democrats as reckless, claiming they would rather see a depression just to hurt Republicans. “I call it ‘1929,’” the president added, comparing the Democrats’ financial management to the Great Depression. Biden’s 2023 budget deal and the fallout The 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act suspended the debt ceiling until January 1, 2025. On the surface, it looked like a breather for the U.S. Treasury, which gained some runway to cover its bills. But the timing is everything. As we reported , Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently confirmed that the U.S. will hit its new borrowing cap between January 14 and January 23, 2025. After that, the government will have to juggle extraordinary measures to avoid defaulting on its obligations. Let’s break this down. The debt ceiling is the total amount of money the government can borrow to cover things like Social Security, Medicare, military salaries, and interest on the national debt. When it hits that cap, the Treasury can’t issue new debt, leaving the government essentially broke. Programs like Medicare, tax refunds, and military operations could all take major hits. Without the 2023 extension, the U.S. would’ve defaulted on its debt for the first time in history, triggering chaos in global markets. Even so, Trump isn’t impressed. He believes Republicans got played, leaving them to clean up Biden’s mess without any leverage. “This was Biden’s problem, not ours,” he wrote. Republicans prepare for a showdown in Congress Things are about to heat up on Capitol Hill. Republicans, who will take control of both chambers on January 3, are already bracing for a fight over the debt ceiling. Hard-right lawmakers have made it clear they won’t back a simple increase. They’re pushing for deep federal spending cuts in exchange for agreeing to raise the borrowing limit. Trump has thrown gasoline on the fire. Just recently, he proposed either eliminating the debt limit entirely or extending it through 2029, the end of what he hopes will be his second term. This wild idea, apparently endorsed by billionaire Elon Musk, didn’t survive long. A mix of Democrats and hard-right Republicans killed the plan, citing fears over ballooning deficits. Democrats accused Trump of wanting to clear space for his “big tax cuts,” which could further worsen the national debt. For perspective, the national debt now stands at $36.1 trillion. That’s not Monopoly money—it’s the result of decades of spending combined with tax cuts. Interest payments alone hit $1.15 trillion this year. To put that in context, the U.S. spent $300 billion less on healthcare and defense combined. What the numbers show Treasury Secretary Yellen’s recent letter outlined the grim timeline. On January 2, 2025, the debt limit will reset, adjusted for a $54 billion redemption in Medicare-related securities. But this adjustment is a blip. By mid-January, the U.S. will max out its borrowing authority again, triggering a financial countdown. Yellen urged Congress to act fast, warning of the severe consequences of inaction. In her words: “However, on January 2, the outstanding debt subject to the limit is projected to decrease by approximately $54 billion, mostly due to a scheduled redemption of nonmarketable securities held by a federal trust fund associated with Medicare payments.” A U.S. default would lead to a downgrade of its credit rating, spiking borrowing costs for businesses and everyday Americans. Global markets would spiral, leaving the Federal Reserve scrambling to stabilize the economy. Adding to the pressure is the Republican Party’s internal divide. Some lawmakers want to weaponize the debt ceiling to force Biden into major spending cuts. Others worry about the economic risks of a default. Trump, as always, has no patience for the cautious crowd. He’s demanding Republicans make Democrats own this mess. “The Democrats must be forced to take a vote on this treacherous issue NOW, during the Biden Administration, and not in June,” he wrote.

38302706,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634670,1735555334,Bitcoin’s explosive rally hits a wall as 2024 ends,"Bitcoin’s rally was fueled by Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, but that momentum is slowing as the year winds down. According to a recent Bloomberg report, Bitcoin traded at $93,085 early Monday in London. It’s down about $15,000 from its mid-December high. The leading cryptocurrency faces challenges after riding high on optimism around Trump’s crypto-friendly stance. Meanwhile, other digital currencies, including Ethereum and the meme coin Dogecoin, have failed to keep up the gains. Trump’s promise of a national Bitcoin reserve and lenient regulations created a positive outlook in the digital assets market. Bitcoin’s strong performance was assisted by speculative buying, which was matched by optimism. However, the Fed’s scaled-back projections have cooled investors’ hopes for significant interest rate cuts. Trump’s pro-crypto attitude hasn’t been enough to sustain Bitcoin’s rally With Trump officially taking office on January 20, the future of crypto policy in the U.S. should be more transparent. This stance contrasts sharply with the work of President Joe Biden’s administration, which was tough on the crypto market, especially because they felt it was an easy way to fall into scandals and fraud. Bitcoin Price Chart | Source: Bloomberg Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone Group, said Bitcoin’s post-election rally has faded. He also pointed to reduced activity in exchange-traded funds tied to the cryptocurrency. At the same time, software company MicroStrategy Inc. has made headlines for its aggressive buying strategy as it takes a position among Bitcoin’s most prominent corporate holders. The company has recently added BTC to its reserves, which now totals more than $40 billion. Traders are also keenly watching to see if MicroStrategy sticks with the usual Monday habit of making BTC purchases . As we saw in the latest slowdown, Bitcoin’s 2024 performance has been impressive overall. The cryptocurrency has surged more than 120% this year, doubling global stocks and easily beating gold. The news comes after a remarkable 2023 rebound when the top cryptocurrency more than doubled in value after a brutal bear market.

38302342,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399829,1735554972,The TON Blockchain Took Everyone by Surprise in 2024 With Huge Ecosystem Growth,"The post The TON Blockchain Took Everyone by Surprise in 2024 With Huge Ecosystem Growth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News 2024 was a transformative year for The Open Network (TON), which reached heights that even its most ardent supporters would have been hard placed to predict back in January. With incredible growth across key metrics like active users, total value locked (TVL), and onchain volume, TON outmuscled every other emerging L1. Leveraging its unique ties to Telegram and its robust technical framework, TON redefined what a scalable, user-centric blockchain ecosystem can achieve. But its success owes less to its architecture, impressive as this is, and much more to the investors and users who got behind it and elevated it into the preeminent retail chain for NFTs, games, and memecoins galore. As 2025 dawns, TON’s breakout year provides a roadmap for what’s possible when technical innovation meets real-world adoption. Breaking Records in 2024 TON began 2024 with a modest $15M in TVL and ended the year at an impressive $275M, reflecting an 18x increase over 12 months. This can be seen in the Dune dashboard DWF Ventures shared that charts TON activity. As the leading web3 investor noted in its summary of TON’s growth this year, much of the credit goes to the dapps that gained serious market share, not least Catizen and Hamster Kombat . What’s significant about these dapps, as well as memecoins such as Notcoin and DOGS, is that they showed what TON projects are capable of when they develop their own distinctive culture. In other words, rather than simply recreating the most popular frogs and dogs on other chains, they went for original content and ideas that were deeply aligned with the spirit of The Open Network. Daily transaction volumes on TON regularly surpassed 4 million this year, and its DEXs processed over 100,000 trades per day. With around 750,000 active daily users, TON has entered the upper echelons of blockchain networks by user activity. Stables Show Up The integration of native USDT in May marked a pivotal moment for TON. Within seven months, the stablecoin’s supply on the network surpassed 1.4 billion, making it a cornerstone of TON’s DeFi actvity. By the year’s end, USDT accounted for over 25% of DEX trading volumes, deepening liquidity and user engagement. At the same time, TON’s token price pulled a respectable 1.5x. This combination of technical milestones and financial performance demonstrated TON’s ability to deliver real-world utility while rewarding its stakeholders. Technical Advancements Catalyze Growth TON’s layered architecture, which includes shard chains and TON DNS, proved instrumental in driving its scalability and enhancing usability. TON maintained low transaction costs and rapid confirmation times throughout the year, with minimal outages, making it a reliable chain to build and trade on. The integration of TON DNS, enabling human-readable wallet addresses, simplified onboarding for new users. Meanwhile, tools like Tonkeeper , the leading non-custodial wallet for TON, provided seamless access to the network’s growing ecosystem, setting the stage for broader adoption. Tonkeeper kept releasing new features all year, from fiat-onramps to support for gasless transactions. Telegram’s native integration of TON wallets was a game-changer, lowering barriers to entry for its 800 million users. Telegram-based trading bots, both for TON and for Solana and EVM chains, was a dominant theme. By mid-2024, TON wallet downloads had surpassed 50 million, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between the blockchain and its parent platform. DeFi Did Numbers TON’s DeFi ecosystem came of age in 2024, with protocols like STON.fi and bemo leading the charge. The inclusion of USDT fueled trading activity, while TON’s interoperability allowed developers to create applications that interacted seamlessly with other blockchains. These developments laid the groundwork for more advanced DeFi protocols including lending platforms, liquidity pools, and synthetic assets. Beyond DeFi, TON saw significant growth in gaming and SoFi applications. Developers leveraged Telegram’s integration to launch entertainment-focused decentralized applications. Memecoin launchpads proliferated in particular. TON Soaks Up VC Bucks TON’s prolific year was helped by the significant amount of capital that flowed into its ecosystem all year. DWF Ventures was predictably one of the first VCs to spot the network’s potential, investing $10M in late 2022. Then, in September 2024, cryptocurrency exchange Bitget and Foresight Ventures jointly invested $30 million in TON. This strategic investment was directed towards the development of Telegram-based projects, particularly focusing on tap-to-earn games like Hamster Kombat and Notcoin. TON Ventures then launched with an inaugural fund of $40 million in August 2024. The firm focuses on investing in early-stage startups building on the TON blockchain, targeting sectors such as decentralized finance, gaming, and the creator economy. Then in December, OKX Ventures, the investment arm of crypto exchange OKX, announced a $5 million investment in TON Ventures to establish a network of experienced builders to develop best practices for TON applications, complementing OKX Ventures’ previous $10 million Telegram Growth Hub. Other major investments include Pantera Capital, managing over $5 billion in assets, which made a notable investment in TON back in May. Two months earlier, Yolo Investments announced an $8 million pledge into TON startups to support the ecosystem’s growth and development. These substantial investments reflect a strong vote of confidence in TON’s potential to drive mainstream adoption of blockchain technologies, particularly through its integration with Telegram’s extensive user base. Why 2025 Looks Even Brighter With a strong foundation in place, TON is poised for even greater achievements in 2025. Its unique alignment with Telegram remains a powerful differentiator, offering unparalleled access to a global user base. The network’s focus on low fees and user-friendly design, meanwhile, leaves it primely positioned to onboard millions more users in the coming year. As TON continues to refine its ecosystem and expand its offerings, it has the potential to become the leading retail chain, particularly for consumer-facing verticals such as gaming and NFTs. Whether it’s dominating the DeFi space or pioneering social finance through Telegram mini-apps, TON has all the ingredients to make 2025 its best year yet.",POSITIVE,USDT | TON,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | USDT | TON,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/the-ton-blockchain-took-everyone-by-surprise-in-2024-with-huge-ecosystem-growth/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Bybit, formerly known as Bybit Fintech Ltd, and its CEO Ben Zhou, have been reprimanded for violating Malaysian securities laws, according to a report by The Edge Malaysia . Bybit has complied with all directives issued by the SC so far, the regulator noted. Malaysian Regulator Warns Against Unregistered Entities The SC warned that investors dealing with unregistered entities are not protected under Malaysian securities laws and are vulnerable to risks such as fraud and money laundering. The SC has also instructed Bybit to immediately cease all promotional activities targeting Malaysian investors, including advertisements on social media, and to terminate its Telegram support group for local users. The decision comes amid concerns about Bybit’s compliance with regulatory requirements and the protection of investor interests. Bybit and its CEO have been listed on the SC’s Investor Alert List since July 2021, emphasizing the platform’s unauthorized operations. You will start seeing “IP address restricted” on your Bybit apps.

The SC urged investors to engage only with recognized market operators, who are subject to regulatory oversight and must adhere to strict guidelines to ensure investor protection. In May of the previous year, the Securities Commission Malaysia also ordered Huobi Global to cease its operations as it had failed to register its trading services. Currently, HATA Digital, Luno, SINEGY, MX Global, Tokenize Technology, and Torum International are the only registered cryptocurrency trading platforms in Malaysia. Malaysia Suffers Huge Losses from Illegal Bitcoin Mining Operations Illegal Bitcoin mining has become an increasing issue in Southeast Asia, with operators taking advantage of the region’s relatively low electricity costs while avoiding the steep energy expenses typically associated with cryptocurrency mining. The practice has led to substantial economic losses in countries like Malaysia, where illegal mining operations have stolen an estimated $723 million worth of electricity between 2018 and 2023. In response, Malaysian authorities have taken severe measures, including the destruction of over $1.2 million worth of confiscated Bitcoin mining rigs. Back in May, Malaysian authorities also revealed that they dismantled a forex investment fraud and cryptocurrency syndicate that had been operating in the country. The syndicate, which had been laundering funds obtained through overseas scams, was targeted in a series of raids conducted across the Klang Valley from May 13 to 21. Earlier this year, Malaysia officially adopted Worldcoin’s iris scan technology as part of its digital transformation strategy. Malaysia aims to use Worldcoin’s advanced biometric system to enhance the verification of digital credentials. The development came after Malaysia’s approval of Worlcoin token public trading on digital assets exchanges recognized by the Malaysian authorities.

DeFi’s Revival and Bitcoin’s Evolution As per a recent report by DLNews, Michael Harvey of Galaxy Digital predicts a reinvigorated decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Established Ethereum protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound are evolving alongside innovative layer-2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism. The next generation of DeFi is marked by advanced platforms like Spark and Ethena, delivering improved trading experiences and scalability. Harvey emphasizes Bitcoin’s potential in DeFi, citing efforts to make it more programmable through protocols like Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Solana also has emerged as a DeFi powerhouse , with its DEX volumes often outpacing Ethereum’s. Traditional Finance Meets Blockchain Amar Kuchinad of Copper.co highlights the growing integration of blockchain into traditional finance. Asset tokenization is expanding beyond stablecoins, with equities and fixed-income securities seeing blockchain adoption. This shift promises faster settlements and reduced risks, especially if U.S. regulators relax constraints such as SAB 121, enabling banks to embrace public blockchain infrastructure. Meanwhile, companies in traditional industries are exploring blockchain for supply chain optimization and payment systems, blending digital innovation with established frameworks. Stablecoins, Emerging Markets, and AI Norris Wang of Balance.fun projects stablecoin float exceeding $250 billion by 2025, driven by pragmatic regulations recognizing these instruments’ hybrid nature. This clarity could ignite DeFi innovation, pulling talent back to hubs like New York. Emerging markets are also poised for transformative change. Mohammad Raafi of Fasset notes how tokenized real estate is democratizing global property investment, with co-ownership models offering affordable access to high-value assets. Finally, Chris Yin of Plume anticipates a deeper convergence of crypto with AI and real-world assets. Innovations like AI agents and practical applications for stablecoins suggest a dynamic landscape ahead, with institutions and retail investors alike driving adoption. As blockchain technology continues to mature, 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year, blending regulatory clarity, technological innovation, and global market expansion to redefine the financial ecosystem.

38302154,https://coinpaper.com/6740/meme-coin-market-stumbles-with-30-decline-in-december,1735554600,Meme Coin Market Stumbles with 30% Decline in December,"The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a mix of turbulence and opportunity as 2024 comes to a close. Meme coins have faced a sharp downturn in December, with their market capitalization dropping nearly 30%, signaling waning demand for these speculative tokens. Meanwhile, altcoin traders are eyeing a potential breakthrough, as analysts suggest that the total altcoin market capitalization needs to rise by 16% to trigger the long-anticipated ”euphoric” altseason. Meme Coin Market Decline: A Look at December's 30% Drop The meme coin market, often characterized by its wild price swings and community-driven hype, saw a dramatic shift in December as its overall market capitalization dropped by nearly 30%. This downturn highlights a significant slowdown in momentum and demand for meme-based tokens, raising questions about the future of the meme coin craze. Data from CoinMarketCap paints a turbulent picture for meme coins in December. On Dec. 1, the market capitalization for these tokens stood at $120.14 billion, climbing to a peak of $137.06 billion on Dec. 9. However, this brief surge was followed by a steep decline, with the total market cap hitting a low of $92.67 billion by Dec. 23. By the end of the month, the meme coin market had settled at $98.72 billion, reflecting an 18% decline from its starting position. Pepe (PEPE), the third-largest meme coin by market capitalization, mirrored the broader market's volatility. Pepe's price spiked to $0.000026 on Dec. 9 before plummeting to $0.000017 by Dec. 20. Despite the price drop, Pepe remained a focal point for traders and exchanges alike. The meme coin's December performance was heavily influenced by its listing on Binance.US on Dec. 4, as the exchange sought to capitalize on the meme coin market's allure. The listing fueled a sharp increase in Pepe’s market cap, which surpassed Uniswap’s token (UNI) in terms of valuation on Dec. 7. By the start of 2024, Pepe’s market cap had skyrocketed to $11 billion, representing an astonishing 18x growth since the beginning of the year. The meme coin frenzy wasn’t limited to Pepe. In December, major exchanges like Coinbase joined the race to list popular meme tokens. Coinbase added tokens such as Moodeng ( MOODENG ), Mog (MOG), and Dogwifhat (WIF) to its platform, further legitimizing the meme coin sector and introducing these speculative assets to a broader audience. This flurry of activity around listings brings attention to the competitive landscape among exchanges vying for a share of the meme coin market. The increased availability of these tokens also contributed to the mid-month surge in market capitalization before the subsequent decline. Traders Reap Rewards Amid Market Turbulence While the meme coin market faced challenges, savvy traders continued to profit immensely. Throughout the year, Pepe was at the center of numerous success stories. In April, a trader turned a $3,000 investment into a staggering $46 million as Pepe’s price soared by over 15,000x. In December, another trader became a focal point of the meme coin narrative. After investing $27 in Pepe tokens and leaving the wallet dormant for over 600 days, the trader transferred approximately $52 million worth of Pepe to a new address. According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, this represented a jaw-dropping 1,900,000x return on investment. The steep decline in December has led many analysts to question whether the so-called ”meme coin supercycle” has reached its end. As enthusiasm for meme-based tokens wanes, some industry experts suggest that the market may shift focus toward more utility-driven projects. However, others argue that the meme coin sector remains resilient, driven by its strong community backing and speculative appeal. The rapid growth and decline of tokens like Pepe illustrate the high-risk, high-reward nature of meme coins. While some traders have reaped extraordinary gains, the broader market downturn serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility in this sector. December's decline in the meme coin market highlights the challenges of sustaining momentum in a speculative and sentiment-driven space. As the new year begins, the future of meme coins hangs in the balance, with traders and investors closely watching whether these tokens can regain their lost traction or if the market will pivot toward more sustainable growth models. Whether this downturn marks the beginning of the end for the meme coin craze or just a temporary setback, one thing is clear: the meme coin market remains one of the most unpredictable and fascinating corners of the cryptocurrency world. Altcoin Market Braces for Euphoria: Total Market Cap Needs 16% Surge to Spark Altseason As the cryptocurrency market inches closer to 2025, traders are eyeing a potential “euphoric” phase for altcoins. However, according to a prominent crypto analyst, this much-anticipated altseason won't materialize until the total altcoin market capitalization surpasses its previous all-time high from 2021. Pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades outlined the scenario in a Dec. 28 post on X, where he emphasized the significance of the TOTAL3 metric—the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Currently sitting at $962.78 billion, the TOTAL3 metric has surged by an impressive 91.45% since the beginning of the year, according to TradingView data . Despite this recovery, the figure remains about 16% below its 2021 all-time high (ATH) of $1.13 trillion, the level Daan believes is crucial for triggering the euphoric phase. Daan elaborated that the market would remain volatile and “choppy” until TOTAL3 breaks past the $1.1 trillion resistance and enters price discovery. However, a dip below $800 billion would prompt him to adopt a more cautious outlook. Daan’s cautious tone aligns with a broader sentiment in the crypto market. Analysts have pointed to increased volatility stemming from traders adopting shorter-term strategies and leveraging hourly charts for decision-making—a stark contrast to the more patient investment approaches of previous market cycles. In a Dec. 28 X post, Daniel Cheung, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, noted that many traders are now behaving like “George Soros,” referring to their constant attempts to time the market. According to Cheung, this mindset has slowed the pace of breakouts compared to prior cycles, as traders are quick to take profits rather than holding for long-term gains. Altcoin Performance: Top Gainers and Rotation Signals Despite the volatility, several altcoins have posted impressive gains, hinting at growing investor interest outside Bitcoin and Ether. CoinMarketCap data shows that the top performers among the top 100 cryptocurrencies over the past seven days include: Bitget Token (BGB): Up 80.65% Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL): Up 42.30% Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Up 31.63% These surges could be signs of the early stages of a potential rotation into altcoins, especially as Bitcoin dominance approaches 60%—a level that often precedes heightened interest in smaller-cap tokens. Pseudonymous trader Dyme echoed this sentiment in a Dec. 27 X post, suggesting that Bitcoin's current risk-reward (R/R) profile is less favorable compared to altcoins. “Altcoins, at this juncture, offer a far more optimal R/R profile than Bitcoin does,” Dyme stated, adding that the time for dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin may not return for another 1.5+ years. Historically, altseason tends to follow periods of consolidation in Bitcoin and Ether prices, as traders seek higher returns in less liquid assets. If TOTAL3 manages to breach its 2021 ATH of $1.13 trillion, the ensuing price discovery could propel the market into the long-awaited euphoric phase. However, until that breakout occurs, traders should brace for continued volatility, as noted by Daan Crypto Trades. The current range between $840 billion and $1.1 trillion remains a battleground for bulls and bears, with market sentiment hanging in the balance. As 2024 draws to a close, the cryptocurrency market is at a critical juncture. With the TOTAL3 metric showing strong year-to-date growth but still shy of its previous ATH, the stage is set for a potential breakout. Traders are increasingly optimistic about the altcoin market’s risk-reward potential, but caution is warranted as volatility persists. The path to altseason may hinge on whether the TOTAL3 market cap can achieve the critical $1.13 trillion milestone. If it does, the euphoric phase could bring explosive gains to the altcoin sector, marking the next chapter in the ever-evolving crypto narrative. Until then, patience and strategy will be key for investors navigating this dynamic market.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6740/meme-coin-market-stumbles-with-30-decline-in-december,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
38302156,https://crypto.news/?p=14323205,1735554587,Former finance minister urges German central bank to consider Bitcoin as a reserve asset,"Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner has advocated for including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in the European Central Bank and Bundesbank reserves to strengthen financial resilience and keep pace with global trends. According to the German media outlet Handelsblatt, Lindner pointed to the United States, where the incoming Donald Trump-led administration is looking to adopt a progressive approach towards crypto-assets, including discussions about incorporating Bitcoin into the Federal Reserve’s reserves alongside traditional assets like gold. Lindner highlighted that cryptocurrencies now make up a significant share of global wealth growth and warned that Germany and Europe risk falling behind if they don’t take similar steps. He believes adding Bitcoin to the country’s reserves could help fortify the financial stability of central bank holdings—an idea recently floated by many political figures around the globe. Lindner, who leads the Free Democratic Party, made his remarks ahead of the German parliamentary elections in February. The FDP has long been lobbying for crypto adoption, with its latest election manifesto stressing the importance of digital assets. On the contrary, Germany’s approach to cryptocurrencies has been notably cautious and has faced criticism from industry stakeholders for its reluctance to fully embrace digital assets. You might also like: Germany should buy Bitcoin as a strategic reserve: Samson Mow Earlier this year, the German government sold around 50,000 BTC seized from the piracy movie site Movie2k.to, following which authorities transferred and sold the funds over a span of nearly four weeks, from mid-June to early July. At the time, the government ignored calls from German MP and Bitcoin advocate Joana Cotar, who instead pitched the idea of adopting BTC as a strategic reserve currency to protect against potential risks in the traditional financial system. Cotar also spearheaded the “Bitcoin Strategies for Nation States” event , featuring Samson Mow, CEO of Bitcoin technology firm Jan3. The event brought together Members of Parliament and Bitcoin supporters to discuss the bellwether crypto asset’s potential as a financial tool for the country. Yet, despite these efforts and growing advocacy, the current government has largely remained quiet on the matter. Skepticism over bitcoin reserve plans Policymakers in Germany aren’t the only ones reluctant to embrace Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Japan’s government recently dismissed calls to adopt Bitcoin as part of its foreign exchange reserves, citing concerns over volatility and a limited understanding of global adoption trends. South Korea is also taking a similar approach, as hinted by Chairman of the Financial Services Commission, Kim Byung-hwan, who said the nation will monitor developments in the U.S. to assess how the adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset unfolds before making any definitive policy decisions. However, some believe the U.S. might not follow through with its Bitcoin reserve plans even though a bill introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis proposes that the government acquire approximately 5% of the total Bitcoin supply over a set period. According to CryptoQuant analyst Ki Young Ju, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will be adopted as a reserve asset unless its global economic dominance is genuinely threatened. With the dollar maintaining its status as the world’s primary reserve currency and U.S. economic strength remaining largely unchallenged, Young Ju believes there’s little incentive for policymakers to pivot toward Bitcoin. Meanwhile, odds of whether the U.S. will approve a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve within Trump’s first 100 days have dropped to 29% on prediction platform Polymarket.

Accordingly, Solana co-founder Stephen Akridge was sued by his ex-wife Elisa Rossi. Elisa Rossi alleged that her ex-husband was secretly profiting and making millions of dollars worth of money from SOL staking rewards. Rossi noted that her ex-husband, Akridge, helped found Solana Labs in 2018 before becoming the company's chief engineer and is now the CEO of cybersecurity firm Cyber ​​Grant. At this point, he alleged that Akridge abused his crypto expertise to gain access to his crypto wallet and secretly embezzle SOL staking rewards that were supposed to belong to him. The couple divorced in early 2023, and Elisa Rossi received a significant amount of Solana from her ex-husband across three crypto wallets as part of the divorce settlement. However, Akridge continued to control the wallets and received the staking rewards himself. “Akridge granted his ex-wife Rossi's Solana wallet control over three accounts containing Solana tokens, but continued to secretly stake Ms. Rossi's Solana tokens and earn millions of dollars in staking rewards through May 2024,” Rossi's lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. The complaint stated that the number of SOL tokens and the amount allegedly stolen were censored as part of the embezzlement. *This is not investment advice.

Will $BTC break up to new highs, or are bears about to break the uptrend with a sharp move to the downside? As Bitcoin reaches its next directional decision, both bulls and bears are making their cases. Market sentiment has been sliding over the last couple of weeks, while the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued to register net outflows. In contrast, MicroStrategy may well announce another Bitcoin purchase on Monday. Market sentiment on the slide Source: Alternative.me The Fear & Greed Index, which graphically shows market sentiment for crypto, has also been on the slide. From last month’s Extreme Greed reading of 84, there has been a slow reduction in sentiment, resulting in today’s reading of 65. This is still in the greed, but it can be seen in the graphic above that this positive sentiment could change if crypto prices continue their reversal. Another net outflow day for U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs The U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded another net outflow day on Friday. The 3.1K outflow was only ameliorated by Blackrock’s IBIT ETF, which continues to buy, with only very seldom days of selling. MicroStrategy purchase announcement on Monday? One potential positive for the bulls is the fact that MicroStrategy has announced a BTC purchase every Monday since 11 November. With a massive amount of buying still to come, it would be a surprise if MicroStrategy did not make an announcement later today. $BTC breakout is nigh Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC shows how near the breakout is. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is displaying a cross up of the two indicator lines, signalling short-term price momentum is potentially to the upside. This momentum would likely increase if the indicator lines cross above the 20.00 level. The 8-hour, 12-hour, and 1-day Stochastic RSIs are also either at, or nearly at the bottom, signalling that momentum could buoy $BTC higher, at least for the short to medium term. If the price breaks to the downside, there is support below at $90,000. If the bears managed to force the price lower than this, the next big support level is all the way down at $73,000. Three conditions to be met for continuation of bull market Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows that $BTC is still above the ascending trendline that stretches all the way back to 2021. While this is the case, the bullish trend is likely to continue. Further down the chart, it can be seen that the Stochastic RSI is coming down rapidly. It will be the job of the Bitcoin bulls to not let the price crash before the indicator lines can start to turn back up again. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Indicator, which signals overbought/oversold conditions, needs to turn back up, which it may be shaping to do, and then eventually rise to pierce through the descending trendline and hold above. If all three of the above conditions are met, the next stage of the bull market could contain some fireworks. However, this still remains to be seen.

U.S. stocks are set to close 2024 with back-to-back losses during the holiday trading period, a rare and unwelcome event that’s happened only twice before in market history. Investors counting on the traditional year-end bump to pad their portfolios are getting coal instead. Early Monday, stock futures pointed to more pain. Dow Jones futures dropped 81 points, or 0.19%. S&P 500 futures fell by 0.16%, while Nasdaq-100 futures stayed flat. The major indices are still logging a strong 2024 overall, but December has been a brutal month. The S&P 500 is down 1%, and the Dow has slid 4.3%, their worst monthly performances since April. Even with these losses, the S&P 500 is up 25.2% for the year, and the Dow has gained 14.1%. The Nasdaq Composite , up 31.4%, is the clear winner for 2024. But no one’s celebrating right now. The “Santa Rally,” a historically bullish stretch that includes the last five trading days of December and the first two of January, is failing to materialize. Historically, the S&P 500 averages a 1.3% gain during this period, according to LPL Financial. This year? Not so much. Instead, Friday’s selloff and mounting year-end profit-taking have left investors in the lurch. Nasdaq shines, Bitcoin fizzles Even with the broader market wobbling, the Nasdaq is wrapping up a stellar fourth quarter. It’s up 8.4%, its longest winning streak since 2021. The S&P 500 isn’t far behind, up 3.6% for the quarter, its fifth straight positive run. The Dow was not so lucky. It’s limping to a 1.6% quarterly gain, barely scraping by. Crypto enthusiasts, meanwhile, are watching Bitcoin lose steam. The apex crypto, which soared earlier this year on President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies, is now sputtering. As of press time, Bitcoin was worth around $93,420, about $15,000 below its all-time high of $108,400. Smaller players like Ether and Dogecoin are also struggling to find their footing. Expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts have cooled the market’s speculative frenzy. Investors are now looking ahead to Trump’s January 20 inauguration, hoping for clarity on his crypto agenda.

Ethereum's growth was boosted by spot Ether ETFs, which doubled inflows to $2.1 billion by December, and regulatory developments. Despite a BTC price correction from $106,000 to $93,000 in December, analysts still predict a potential rally to $200,000. The altcoin market is also close to a breakout phase, with TOTAL3 approaching its 2021 peak of $1.13 trillion. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 65, signaling cooling sentiment. Ethereum Leads Long-Term Holding Trends The cryptocurrency market experienced a shift in investor sentiment throughout 2024 as Ethereum (ETH) gained traction among long-term holders while Bitcoin (BTC) saw a decline. Data that was shared by IntoTheBlock revealed that the percentage of Ether holders keeping their tokens for more than a year rose from 59% in January to 75% by the end of the year. In contrast, Bitcoin long-term holders fell from 70% to 62% over the same period. As of Dec. 30, long-term Bitcoin holders accounted for 62.3% of total BTC ownership, while Ethereum long-term holders reached 75.1%. The increase in long-term Ethereum holders proves that there is growing confidence in the asset as it heads into 2025. This sentiment is also boosted by other developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, including a surge in spot Ether ETF inflows. These inflows doubled from $1 billion in November to $2.1 billion by the end of December. Additionally, the incorporation of staking features into Ether ETFs and regulatory shifts, like the potential reforms in the SEC and increased oversight by the CFTC, are seen as contributing factors to Ethereum's strengthening position. Bitcoin, on the other hand, faced a challenging period in December. Technical analyst Gert Van Lagen noticed a “blow-off” in BTC’s price after the asset dropped from an all-time high of $106,000 to $93,000 between Dec. 16 and 30. The decline was attributed to long-term holders cashing out due to market euphoria. Despite this short-term correction, Van Lagen still forecasted that Bitcoin could surpass $200,000 in the near future. Overall, the Ethereum network’s continued innovation and rising institutional interest positioned it as a key player heading into 2025, while Bitcoin is still a dominant force with major price potential despite its recent fluctuations. Experts also believe that a Trump administration could improve Ethereum’s prospects even more. Ether Eyes Q1 Rally Ether could be one of the front runners in a potential Q1 rally in 2025, according to historical patterns, but some analysts still warned that macroeconomic challenges could temper market momentum. Historically, the first quarters after a United States election and a Bitcoin halving have been favorable for Ether. In fact, Q1 of 2017 and Q1 of 2021 delivered impressive returns of 518% and 161%. These performances outpaced Bitcoin, which saw returns of 11.9% and 103.2% during the same periods. Spot Ether ETFs are also expected to play a role in fueling a potential rally. Some optimistic projections suggest that Ether ETFs could see more than $50 billion in net inflows in 2025. CK Zheng, CIO of ZX Squared Capital, agrees with these predictions, and believes that regulatory changes under the Trump administration could drive large increases in ETF inflows and further strengthen the digital asset class. Despite the optimism, not all industry experts are bullish on Ether's prospects. Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, predicts that Ether may underperform in 2025 because of a hawkish macroeconomic climate. He specifically pointed to the Federal Reserve's Dec. 18 decision to reduce the number of projected 2025 interest rate cuts from five to two, pushing the federal funds rate forecast to 3.9% instead of the previously expected 3.4%. This tighter monetary policy could create a much less favorable environment for risk-on assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Thielen suggested that Ether might struggle to achieve a new all-time high in these conditions, though he pointed out that Bitcoin could still reach $160,000 in a best-case scenario or stabilize around $125,000. The broader cryptocurrency market reflected these macroeconomic concerns as the total market capitalization pulled back 12+% to $3.29 trillion. ETH is currently trading hands at $3,418 after its price saw a slight 0.76% increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is trading at $93.731.83 after its price dropped by 1.29%. ETH’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Altcoin Market Nears Key Breakout Threshold According to pseudonymous trader Daan Crypto Trades, the altcoin market is approaching a critical juncture, and the total market cap of altcoins needs to rise approximately 16% to trigger the euphoric phase of an altcoin season. In a Dec. 28 post on X, Daan stated that the “euphoria” or “mania” phase will likely begin once TOTAL3 , the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin and Ether, surpasses its 2021 all-time high of $1.13 trillion and enters price discovery. Daan stated that as long as TOTAL3 stays in the $840 billion to $1.1 trillion range, market conditions are likely to remain choppy. He also advised traders to stay cautious if the metric falls below $800 billion. The trader's caution comes amidst a broader sentiment of heightened volatility in the crypto market. Syncracy Capital co-founder Daniel Cheung attributed this to a shift in trader behavior. Cheung also suggested that an increasing number of traders are adopting short-term strategies and are closely monitoring hourly charts and leveraging their positions, which has slowed the pace of breakouts compared to previous cycles. Despite the volatile environment, there are still signs of rotation toward altcoins. According to CoinMarketCap , some of the top-performing cryptocurrencies over the past week include Bitget Token, Virtuals Protocol, and Pudgy Penguins. With Bitcoin dominance nearing 60% and its price stalling in the final days of 2024, traders are increasingly turning their attention to altcoins. Pseudonymous trader Dyme also currently prefers altcoins due to their superior risk-reward profile at this stage in the market cycle. Dyme suggested that the time to accumulate Bitcoin has passed for the next 1.5 years, and believes the better opportunities lie with altcoins. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Falls The Crypto Fear & Greed Index declined to its lowest level since mid-October due to the recent Bitcoin price slump. As of Dec. 30, the index stands at 65. This means that the index is still in greed territory but reflects a cooling market mood compared to the highs that were seen in November. Crypto fear and greed index (Source: Alternative ) Throughout November and December, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index maintained scores above 70, driven by optimism after President-elect Donald Trump’s victory and the election of several pro-crypto lawmakers. The index peaked at 94 on Nov. 22, signaling extreme greed. The index’s calculation incorporates multiple factors, including market momentum, dominance, social media activity, Google Trends, volatility, and surveys. Despite recent market fluctuations, Bitcoin is still the top-performing asset of the past decade, according to Prem Reginald, a CoinGecko blockchain researcher. In 2024 alone, Bitcoin delivered returns of 129%, greatly outpacing traditional assets like gold, which posted 32.2% year-to-date gains, and the S&P 500, which returned 28.3%.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6739/ethereum-outpaces-bitcoin-as-long-term-holders-surge-in-2024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Burniske, a former analyst at Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest and current partner at Placeholder, says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) has likely already printed its lows for the bull run, and given that “quality alts” are down significantly, opportunities for the crypto bulls are abound. “Loving where the market is right now. BTC is making PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) people fear a precipice when it’s already filled the liquidation wick and fell as far as ~15% from its recent highs. Quality alts are holding or putting in higher lows on a number of important timeframes. Funding rate and sentiment reveal the blood has drained out of late-blooming bulls’ faces. Santa gave relief for a day but didn’t deliver in full. That said, given all the bullish developments of Q4 that are now masked by tinges of fear in the market, the setup is sweet for our entry into 2025. The short-term is always unpredictable and volatile, but if you’re a long-term investor with conviction, you should be salivating.” Source: Chris Burniske/X According to the investor, Solana ( SOL ) looks ready to outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). He says he expects SOL to be the “faster horse” of the three major crypto assets. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $93,489, while Ethereum is worth $3,356 and SOL is trading for $190.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/new-solana-memecoin-musk-ai-king-muskai-will-skyrocket-16000-before-exchange-listing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38301505,https://finbold.com/?p=224105,1735553329,AI predicts XRP price for 2025,"XRP has firmly positioned itself as one of the top winners in the current market cycle, emerging from a prolonged consolidation below $1. Several key fundamentals suggest that this momentum could continue into the new year. While XRP is influenced by general market sentiment, the regulatory landscape will be crucial. Specifically, the upcoming leadership changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the ongoing case between the regulator and Ripple will be pivotal in determining whether XRP can make another attempt at reaching record highs. Currently, XRP is holding above the $2 support level, though market volatility has weighed it down. As of press time, the token was trading at $2.24, down over 5% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, XRP is also in the red, down 6%. Despite these recent setbacks, XRP’s post-election breakout has propelled the asset to a remarkable 260% increase year-to-date. XRP one-week price chart. Source: Finbold XRP price prediction for 2025 As for the token’s price prediction for 2025, OpenAI’s artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT-4o , shared insights regarding what to expect. ChatGPT’s analysis suggested that Ripple’s growth and potential victories in ongoing SEC cases could drive XRP to between $5 and $7, particularly if adoption in cross-border payments accelerates, this being the base case scenario. In a more optimistic case, the AI platform noted that a broad cryptocurrency market bull run and Ripple’s expanded integration with banks might push XRP past $10. There is even a possibility, albeit less likely, that mass adoption and favorable regulations could propel the token to over $20 by 2025. Conversely, lingering regulatory challenges or a downturn in the broader crypto market could see XRP drop to between $1 and $2. While $5 seems to be the most reasonable estimate, according to ChatGPT, such a price target would push XRP’s market cap to nearly $300 billion. XRP’s technical outlook Regarding the technical aspect, cryptocurrency trading expert Armando Pantoja’s analysis in an X post on December 30 suggested that the token will likely hit a target of $3. The analyst noted that while some XRP holders express frustration over the current consolidation, the charts paint a different picture of strength and potential. He pointed out that XRP is forming a symmetrical triangle, a bullish continuation pattern often preceding upward price movement. XRP has stabilized just above the $2 mark, coiling tightly within the triangle. Pantoja indicated a possible breakout could send XRP between $3.20 and $4. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Armando Pantoja On the other hand, XRP is exhibiting a moderate level of volatility at 7.25%, indicating that potential price swings are to be expected. It is trading well above its 50-day Simple Moving Average ( SMA ) of $1.81 and its 200-day SMA of $0.85, pointing to bullish momentum over the medium and long term. However, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is at 46.95, placing it in a neutral zone—not overbought or oversold—which could suggest a period of consolidation before the next move. In summary, it will be important to watch for a break above the $2.10 level or retest the $1.81 support to determine the next direction in price movement.

Inspired by the wildly popular series, these crypto tokens first gained attention in 2021 when the initial season created a global phenomenon. The hype around the Squid Game cryptocurrency came with serious consequences, leaving many investors burned. Finally launched Squid Game Token 2 Contract : 0xA64fC73D36B8EaA59391fFb3E5ef77d74a62e9b5 Telegram : https://t.co/37aW6BhadV Website: https://t.co/bEtuimisrT Please put slippage from 18-21% pic.twitter.com/IIlGQUKf0P — Squid Game Token 2 (@Official_SGT2) December 25, 2024 In 2021, the SQUID token, a play-to-earn cryptocurrency, saw a surge in value as it capitalized on the show’s popularity. Despite having no official affiliation with Netflix or the series creators, the token’s value skyrocketed, reportedly increasing by over 75,000% at its peak. SQUID Token’s Rise Was Short-Lived While SQUID saw tremendous price spikes, its journey ended in a notorious rug pull, a type of cryptocurrency scam in which developers abandon a project and abscond with investors’ funds. SQUID’s value plummeted to nearly zero within minutes, leaving many investors with devastating losses. Fast forward to 2023, and Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced it was investigating the SQUID token crash, as reported by Barrons. The exchange shared the token is likely a scam, highlighting how opportunistic projects can exploit pop culture phenomena to lure unsuspecting investors. Despite this, the buzz surrounding Season Two has sparked interest in whether similar trends could re-emerge. Squid Game Token Extremely Risky? “Clearly, if Binance is investigating it for fraud, then it’s probably not a great investment,” Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, told CryptoNews. “Another clue is that the project’s name is clearly an unsanctioned ripoff of the popular Netflix show, a remarkable show of bad faith by the tokens creators. Investing in tokens can be extremely risky but sometimes quite lucrative if you know what to look for. Investors should research the projects team,” warns Greenspan. $SQUID Tokens A quick check for Squid tokens on Phantom wallet, revealed an abundance of SQUID token variations: The most popular SQUID token, built on the Ethereum blockchain, is currently trading up 280% in 24 hours on Monday. While jumping on board meme coin hype trains could be a potentially lucrative opportunity, investing in tokens like SQUID and its numerous copycats carries a lot of risk. Investors should be extremely careful and, of course, always DYOR. “Investors are returning to the SQUID token largely due to its hype and thematic appeal, driven by speculation for quick profits and the fear of missing out (FOMO), despite its troubled history,” said Avi Iluz, CEO of Gems Trade.

38301392,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399827,1735553046,Tether’s USDT Delisting: Should Crypto Investors Be Worried?,"The post Tether’s USDT Delisting: Should Crypto Investors Be Worried? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin by market cap, is facing a major shift as it is delisted from EU exchanges starting today. This move has sparked a wave of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) across the crypto market. Crypto analyst Axel Bitblaze suggests it might actually present a unique buying opportunity, much like past Tether-related FUD events. In a market where volatility is the norm, this latest development raises some interesting questions about the future of stablecoins and the crypto market as a whole. 12/ ➔ Conclusion: Tether FUD means buying opportunity, and the same goes for China ban FUD too. Interestingly, you'll either hear these FUDs at the pico bottom or during the full-blown bull run. Do one thing, take screenshots of crypto prices today and then wait till… — Axel Bitblaze (@Axel_bitblaze69) December 29, 2024 Keep reading to discover why experts aren’t as concerned as the headlines suggest. Why Is USDT Being Removed from EU Exchanges? The delisting of USDT comes as a result of the European Union’s new MiCA regulations , which impose strict rules on stablecoin reserves. Tether hasn’t met these reserve requirements, forcing EU exchanges to remove USDT. However, this doesn’t make USDT illegal in the EU. According to Bitblaze, crypto investors in the EU can still hold USDT in non-custodial wallets and trade it on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) . The restriction only applies to trading USDT on MiCA-compliant exchanges. Is the Stablecoin Market in Trouble? Despite the FUD surrounding Tether, Bitblaze points out that the stablecoin market is still strong. USDT maintains a market cap of $138.5 billion and a daily trading volume of $44 billion, with 80% of that volume coming from Asia. Bitblaze reassures investors that the value of their assets isn’t dependent on which stablecoin they used to buy them. Whether you use USDT, Bitcoin, or fiat currency, your assets are safe as long as they’re stored properly. In fact, Bitblaze suggests that this situation may turn out to be more bullish than bearish. Tether Has Remained Resilient Bitblaze reminds us that Tether has faced similar FUD in the past and has always bounced back. For example, in October 2024, when the U.S. government launched an investigation into Tether, Bitcoin’s price dropped by $2,000 within minutes. However, after Tether’s CEO denied the claims, Bitcoin quickly recovered, rising by 43%. Other FUD events, such as accusations from the UN and attempts to depeg USDT, have caused temporary price drops but were followed by strong bull runs. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Tether Invests $775M in Rumble and Targets AI Domination by 2025 , Tether FUD: A Signal to Buy? Bitblaze believes that Tether-related FUD has historically been a sign of buying opportunities. These events tend to happen either when the market is at its lowest point or during a bull run. He suggests that crypto investors take screenshots of current prices and revisit them in February or March 2025. He predicts that most assets will be worth much more by then. Despite the EU delisting, USDT is expected to remain a dominant force in the stablecoin market. As its market cap and demand continue to rise, this short-term setback is unlikely to change USDT’s long-term prospects. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38301607,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634685,1735552925,Malaysia orders Bybit to halt local operations,"From being one of the largest trading platforms in Malaysia to losing credibility, Bybit is on the edge, facing legal troubles. The crypto exchange and its CEO, Ben Zhou, have been the subject of an enforcement case by the Malaysia Securities Commission (SC) for operating without legal registration. The SC explained, “This decision comes after concerns about the platform’s compliance with local regulatory requirements and protecting investors’ interests.” The regulator added, “Operating a DAX without obtaining the SC’s registration as a Recognised Market Operator (RMO) is an offense under Section 7(1) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007.” Bybit was ordered to suspend its website, mobile applications, and any other digital platforms in Malaysia. Beginning on December 11, the organization was granted fourteen business days to execute this action. In addition, Bybit was directed to cease all advertising activities directed at Malaysian investors and to terminate its Telegram support group for Malaysians. How did Bybit get here? According to reports, Bybit and Zhou have been included in the regulator’s investor alert list since July 2021 due to the same regulatory violation. However, according to Malaysia’s securities regulator, Bybit has adhered to the enforcement actions as instructed. Bybit, on their Malaysia telegram channel, said to the investors, “We understand that this may cause some inconvenience Once we have secured the appropriate licenses, we look forward to reconnecting with you again in the future.” 裂开。。 #bybit #malaysia pic.twitter.com/deMltSxHKY — 老江🌿 (@KangWeon) December 18, 2024 Still, the SC reminded investors that Malaysian securities laws do not protect those who trade crypto on unregistered platforms and that they are at a higher risk of being victims of financial crimes. The SC asserted, “This enforcement action underscores our commitment to safeguarding investors and maintaining a fair marketplace.” Notably, in August, the Bybit exchange also departed France as a result of the country’s efforts to impede the acquisition of operating licenses for crypto companies. This was in anticipation of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). Legalities in Malaysia on the crypto industry Malaysia does not recognize crypto as legal tender. The Central Bank of Malaysia Act effectively excludes crypto from this status. The bank designates the ringgit as the country’s exclusive legal tender. Although the Act does not explicitly prohibit crypto, it restricts the definition of legal tender to the ringgit. But, the Capital Markets and Services Order classifies crypto as securities. This classification provides them with a specific legal status within Malaysia’s financial regulatory framework. The regulatory framework is further fortified by the Capital Markets and Services Order. This classifies specific digital currencies and tokens as securities. It places them under the jurisdiction of the Securities Commission [SC) Malaysia. The SC imposes supplementary compliance obligations on crypto businesses, such as the acquisition of the requisite licenses to operate legally. Organizers of unregistered coin offerings may be subject to a sanction of up to 10 million Malaysian ringgit (approximately $2.5 million) or a maximum of 10 years in prison. What about other crypto asset trading platforms in Malaysia? Putting a hold on Bybit is not the last straw for crypto investors. BYDFi is one of the remaining crypto trading platforms that is widely recognized in Malaysia and provides a trading experience for Malaysian traders. It has the capacity to meet the requirements of traders who desire to trade crypto using the Malaysian Ringgit. However, it demands KYC requirements. Phemex is also renowned in Malaysia for its no KYC policy, which is particularly appealing to merchants. This policy enables them to engage in cryptocurrency transactions without disclosing personal information. However, it does not provide Interest-earning products. In addition, BingX is an alternative crypto exchange in Malaysia. It offers an innovative platform for Malaysian traders looking to enter the crypto industry. However, it is complex in derivatives trading. Binance also makes it to the list as an option for Malaysian investors. It is especially for individuals seeking to diversify their crypto portfolio beyond conventional options due to its extensive selection of altcoins.

Yet, amidst the fluctuations of the market, certain projects like Web3Bay, SUI, and Solana shine brightly, heralding new directions for future growth. Web3Bay is capturing attention with its promising presale, suggesting an eye-opening 6430% ROI, while blockchain powerhouses SUI and Solana demonstrate robustness and adaptability, marking them as solid investments for forward-thinking portfolios.

By harnessing blockchain technology, it integrates cryptocurrency payments with traditional options like PayPal, welcoming users from all corners of the globe, regardless of their banking status. Historically, cross-border e-commerce has wrestled with steep fees, daunting currency conversion expenses, and scant payment options. Web3Bay is changing the game with its hybrid payment system and modest transaction fees, offering a 5% discount to users who pay with the 3BAY token, thus sweetening the pot for participants. For merchants, particularly in less developed areas, Web3Bay spells freedom, bypassing conventional banking requirements and offering instant access to the global marketplace, accepting both cryptocurrency and fiat. At the core of Web3Bay’s operation is a commitment to security and transparency. Automated, trustless transactions are the backbone, supported by smart contracts, while decentralized storage and multi-signature wallets ensure the safety of data and financial assets. Currently, 3BAY tokens are available at $0.003, set to increase by 15% at each of the upcoming 28 presale stages. This structured pricing is not just an incentive for early birds but also a beacon for potentially remarkable returns, with prospects exceeding 6430% once the platform reaches full operational status. For visionaries eager to dive into the next innovation wave in e-commerce, Web3Bay offers both a groundbreaking shopping environment and an attractive investment horizon. Why Sui Is One Of The Best Crypto Investments Right Now SUI is catching the wind in its sails, exhibiting resilience with a 12.8% uptick from its recent dip, thanks to pivotal partnerships with entities like Phantom Wallet and Babylon Labs. Recently, SUI approached its record high, reaching around $4.60, buoyed by a spike in on-chain activities with its smart contracts’ Total Value Locked (TVL) nearing an impressive $1.8 billion. Daily transaction volumes consistently float between $400 million and $600 million, showcasing a strong, active network. Solana: Mirroring Bitcoin’s Rally with Potential for New Highs Solana has recently grabbed headlines, echoing Bitcoin’s early 2024 upsurge and hinting at substantial potential upswings. Analysts speculate that Solana could scale new heights in early 2025, driven by expanding adoption, bustling trade volumes, and a supportive environment for alternative coins. A striking development saw Sui outperform Solana in daily transactions, registering 58.37 million compared to Solana’s 35.41 million over two days, highlighting Sui’s swift uptake and scalability. Key Insights As the digital currency sphere evolves, pinpointing the best crypto investments necessitates choosing projects that meld innovative spirit with practical utility and sustained growth prospects. Web3Bay’s boundary-less e-commerce platform, with its novel presale approach and versatile payment systems, offers a distinctive chance for investors keen on pioneering digital economic ventures. Likewise, SUI’s strategic alliances and impressive transaction growth emphasize its strong market uptake and expansion capability. Solana’s reliable performance and its alignment with Bitcoin’s market movements further cement its standing as a promising investment for substantial returns by 2025. Each of these projects, unique in their aspirations and execution, exemplifies the vibrant evolution of blockchain innovation. Whether captivated by Web3Bay’s disruptive e-commerce model, SUI’s ecosystem enhancements, or Solana’s broad appeal, now is an opportune moment to align your investments with these frontrunners.

Source – Coinpaprika The event will highlight strategic decisions for the upcoming years, including the 2025 budget. Such sentiments will likely renew investor interest in Cardano’s future potential. Analysts believe bullish announcements during the meeting will trigger uptrends for ADA, potentially reclaiming the $1 psychological zone. However, the support barrier at $0.85 remains crucial for Cardano’s price trajectory. The altcoin trades at $0.8672 after losing 2.48% of its value in the last 24 hours. Chart by Coinmarketcap The upcoming annual conference could keep ADA afloat in the upcoming sessions, helping it to hold above the crucial $1.85 support. That would be crucial for quick recoveries to $1. However, continued selling pressure will likely plunge the token below $1.85, triggering swift dips toward the foothold at $0.77. What indicators say According to technical analysis, ADA’s price exhibits mid-term bearish sentiments. The alt might witness faded buyer activity before bullish revivals, possibly in H1 2025. The daily chart shows Cardano has formed a probable head and shoulder setup after touching the upper boundary of its months-long bullhorn consolidation. With the 24H Relative Strength Index’s bearish divergence, ADA remains poised for price dips in the upcoming sessions before bouncing back in Q1 2025. Moreover, Cardano’s price has repeatedly closed beneath the 50-day MA, confirming significant weaknesses in bullish momentum. Magnified momentum could dip the alt towards the support at $0.77. failure to hold this zone might trigger sell-offs to $0.68. ADA’s future Meanwhile, investors showcase trust in Cardano.

In accordance with the global release of Squid Game Season 2 on Dec. 26, SEND Arcade has decided to release the second installment of Squad Game. According to Magic Eden, Squad Game is a fully online “interactive survival game” where more than 450 players participate in a series of challenges spanning three weeks starting on January 2025. Similar to how Netflix’s Squid Game works, the prize pool will keep increasing as more and more players get eliminated. In the first round of Squad Game, players must choose one out of four symbols: a circle, a triangle, a star or an umbrella. The symbol with the smallest number of choosers will become the Death Symbol and the players who chose it will be eliminated. The second round is called Red Light, Red Light, echoing one of the iconic Squid Game rounds where a giant doll shoots down players who make a move in a twisted version of freeze tag. This round and the ones that follow are still closed from the last Squad Game in September, with a list of winners still shown on a leaderboard. It is still unknown whether the sequel will feature the same games or if new ones will be introduced. It is known that Squid Game Season 2 features old and new games, so it is possible that Squad Games might once again follow in its footsteps.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto, is predicted to rise above $5,500 in the next 12 months, the report said.  ""A combination of institutional, corporate and nation state adoption will propel bitcoin to new heights in 2025,"" wrote Alex Thorn, Galaxy's head of research.  Galaxy said it expects five Nasdaq-100 companies and five nation states to say they have added bitcoin to their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds next year, and competition among these countries will drive the next wave of adoption, the report said.  The total assets under management (AUM) of U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is expected to surpass $250 billion in 2025, Galaxy forecast, and at least one leading wealth management platform will announce a bitcoin allocation of 2% or higher next year.  Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) is also expected to boom, Galaxy said. The total amount of BTC locked in DeFi is forecast to double next year from the current $11 billion.  The trend of miners pivoting to high-performance computing (HPC) is expected to continue, and more than half of the 20 largest listed bitcoin mining firms will announce deals with artificial intelligence firms (AI) or hyperscalers in 2025, the report added.

38300876,https://crypto.news/?p=14323179,1735551983,Ethereum could surge to $6K by Q1 2025 as multiple bullish patterns emerge,"Ethereum, which has seen a significant jump in long-term holders in 2024, could potentially rally to as high as $6,000 in Q1 2025, according to analysts. In a Dec. 29 X post , CryptoBullet, who has over 152k followers, noted that Ethereum is in the process of forming a bull pennant pattern on the 1-day ETH/USDT chart. He expects this pattern to be completed in the coming months, potentially leading to a massive surge to as high as $6,000 within Q1 2025. In technical analysis, a bull pennant pattern forms after an asset experiences an uptrend and typically indicates a potential continuation of the rally. The analyst recalled price action seen in May 2021 when ETH rallied past $4,000 for the first time after breaking out of a similar pattern in Q1 that year. Analyst James CryptoGuru predicted a similar price target for Ethereum based on a technical indicator. He noted that ETH has formed a multi-month bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern throughout 2024, which is expected to be completed by early 2025. If ETH breaks out of this pattern, it could potentially rally to as high as $8,100. Meanwhile, fellow analyst Jelle also anticipates a major breakout for ETH, pointing that Bitcoin dominance has broken down from a multi-year trend. They highlighted that the last time this occurred, ETH’s price quadrupled within approximately five months. You might also like: Ethereum price falls as spot ETF, staking inflows rise The optimistic predictions from these experts align with a surge in the number of ETH long-term holders—those holding the asset for over a year—rising from 59% in January to 75% by the end of 2024. In contrast, BTC long-term holders dropped from 70% to 62% during the same period, according to a Dec. 30 X post from IntoTheBlock, citing its platform’s data . The continued growth in long-term holders could help sustain ETH’s price rally as the asset heads into 2025. Another potential catalyst for an Ethereum rally in Q1 lies in its historical performance patterns following the first quarters of years marked by a U.S. election and a Bitcoin halving cycle. According to CoinGlass data, the first quarter of 2017 and 2021 were among Ether’s best-performing quarters, with recorded gains of 518% and 161%, respectively. Additionally, spot Ether exchange-traded funds have emerged as a major growth driver, witnessing inflows on 22 of the past 24 trading days and accumulating over $2.5 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. The consistent momentum has fueled optimism, with one enthusiastic ETH advocate predicting that Ether ETFs could attract more than $50 billion in net inflows by 2025. Despite the bullish catalysts, the second-largest cryptocurrency could face some downward pressure due to selling activity among large holders. According to data from ITB, whale holder net inflow has dropped significantly, dropping from 220.88k ETH, valued at nearly $737 million on Dec. 23 to just 14.45k ETH valued at nearly $48 million on Dec. 28. The sharp drop in whale investments indicates a potential loss of confidence in the asset’s future gains among large holders. Such a trend could influence retail investors , who often follow the moves of these experienced market participants. At press time, Ether ( ETH ) was up 1%, exchanging hands at $3,413 per coin.

38302446,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53437,1735551959,"Cardano Price Prediction: AI Places ADA at $30 By 2030, But Rising Altcoin at $0.175 Could Reach It Sooner by 2026","With established tokens like Cardano (ADA) matching the competition with rising projects like Rexas Finance (RXS), it is not lost on many that the landscape for cryptocurrency is still fluid. Despite having a configuration best suited for a long-term horizon, AI believes that $30 for ADA would only be realizable by 2030. To the contrary, Rexas Finance, which trades at $0.175, is in the headlines and would have no problem reaching those storied figures in 2026. We can compare the two coins to understand why Rexas Finance will be the first to get these figures over Cardano. The Long-Term Vision of Cardano On December 24th, 2024, Tokenomist, one of the leading crypto insights service providers, announced on X that on December 26th, Cardano will unlock 18.53 million ADA tokens, which are estimated to be worth 16.37 million dollars. Tokens impact market dynamics, balancing potential selling pressure with increased liquidity and utility opportunities. This particular case of Cardano could help prices stay at the same level or even break to the bullish side of the pattern. Since Cardano possesses a solid ecosystem and has clear objectives, it is positioned as one of the leaders in blockchain technology. Tokens that have been unlocked can be put in staking or poured into decentralized applications where the use and the demand are much expected. AI indicates a figure of around $30 for Cardano by 2030. This only shows the confidence in such assets’ profitability in many industries, including education and healthcare. Thanks to its massive presale success, impressive tokenomics, and active community, Rexas Finance will reach the $30 mark by 2026. Rexas Finance (RXS): The New Competitor of Cardano Rexas Finance has become a notable figure in the crypto industry due to its strong presale tokens and innovative presale tokenomics. Rexas Finance has raised over $33 million and sold over 381 million tokens across all presale stages. Starting from $0.03 during its first presale phase, RXS has reached as much as $0.175 at Stage 11. This rapid growth indicates the project’s capacity to attract investors and retain investor momentum, differentiating it from the established but slowly growing competitors. Rexas Finance’s success can be attributed to its tokenomics. Forty-two and a half percent of the total supply is set aside for the presale, meaning that early investors could buy into the project at low rates. The project also provides 22.5 percent of its tokens to a staking pool to encourage long-term holding and mitigate price volatility. Also, 15 percent of the tokens are set aside for liquidity. These well-designed allocation mechanisms ensure the platform’s survival and future growth. Trust and Transparency Development Explaining the steps of its strategy to the crypto landscape, Rexas Finance outlined three core values—trust, loyalty, and transparency—as central to its strategy of building resiliency in the market. Also, a Certik audit has lucratively reinforced the security of the project and provided investors with the necessary reassurance regarding its reliability as an investment. The RXS listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko shows great potential for attracting business since registration is only the first step in increasing the project’s visibility. The evidence shows that the project is designed with transparency and long-term sustainability in mind. The project’s plan to give away $1 million again underscores the community aspect of the problem. In particular, Rexas Finance excited its many supporters by promising to randomly select 20 winners and reward each with RXS tokens worth $50,000. Such an approach strengthens the community’s unity and engages new members willing to participate in the project’s effective growth. Reasons Why Rexas Finance Might Beat Cardano Rexas Finance and Cardano are head-to-head competitors in expanding the crypto ecosystem. It’s plausible that Rexas Finance would surpass Cardano even though Cardano offers strong groundwork for growth regardless of the instability within which Rexas Finance operates. When considering the $30 price point, particularly within a rival crypto market, the RXS presale was quite successful. This and its enhanced community engagement strategies focused on robust economic model investment. If Rexas Finance was able to address swift adoption along a series of substantive efforts, it’s possible that it could achieve that price point by 2026. Despite these efforts, Cardano may still be slow to respond to advancing projects. In this case, Cardano may lack the capacity to compete against more competitive projects, considering risk-intolerant clients prefer this slow method. Even though both projects have some features in common, their different targeting techniques enable them to operate in the same marketplace. Nonetheless, the growth ranges and strategies are different, thus accommodating every investor type. Conclusion Rexas Finance has given competition to popular cryptocurrencies such as Cardano. It has caught up with the competition, has unique tokenomics, handles the community well, and grows quickly. While Cardano has a long-term price target of $30 by 2030, this shows the potential of the project and the time frames it can reach. However, Rexas Finance, on the other hand, has the potential to achieve this mark in 2026, which is more appealing to investors looking for a faster investment strategy. The crypto market is and will continue to be rapid, with Rexas Finance being one of the key players with the tools to handle competitors aged decades or more.

38301021,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634681,1735551722,"Sky Protocol (Maker DAO) posts record December fees, closes the second most successful year since 2021","Sky Protocol built up its loans in 2024, leading to record interest fees in December. Тhe successful month also wraps up one of the best years for the DeFi lending protocol since its 2021 peak. Sky Protocol locked in $22.18M in earnings for December, the highest level for the past six months, based on TokenTerminal data. Its performance reflects several trends in the past year, including DeFi’s overall recovery. Sky Protocol (formerly MakerDAO) achieved peak earnings in December, reflecting the market rally in Q4. | Source: DeFi Llama Most of the protocol fees also reflect the usage of DAI/USDS, the native stablecoin used for loans. In the past year, the supply of DAI rose to $6.2B, the highest level since the 2022 peak of $7.24B DAI. The creation and circulation of DAI are no longer tied to the MKR asset but rely on a wider selection of collaterals. Sky Protocol shifted its collateral balance in the past year The supply growth in the past year was achieved through a more diverse mix of collaterals, including tokenized T-bills. With this move, Sky Protocol became one of the drivers of RWA adoption, as the crypto sector put some of its earnings into T-Bills and then used them to secure additional growth. The third trend is the successful swap from MakerDAO to Sky Protocol. Over the past 12 months, the DeFi protocol had to go through rebranding in addition to overhauling its collaterals. As a result, MakerDAO stepped back, leaving Aave (AAVE) to become the top lending protocol. Some of the sub-DAO projects also relied on Aave for their passive yield, creating special vaults. Despite the slowdown against Aave, the treasury of Sky Protocol is also at a peak. The project holds $2.1B in its treasury as an additional security for the dollar peg of DAI/USDS. DAI/USDS is now supported by three main types of collateral. Crypto vaults hold more than $3.43B in value locked. The Peg Stability Module (PSM) holds special vaults with $1.56B in assets. Tokenized securities make up $296M after a recent removal of liquidity. RWA vaults shifted down from their peak valuation of $3.2B in 2023. The collaterals of Sky Protocol are not fixed and may reflect market conditions and potential risks. During bull market periods, DAI/USDS is more widely used for loans. The market rally in the last quarter of 2024 was immediately reflected in Sky Protocol’s revenues, which reached a peak of $1.3M in daily fees on December 7. Sky Protocol to push more for USDS adoption next year Sky Protocol continues with its calls to switch from DAI to USDS next year. The protocols also plan to grow more aggressively in the coming months, regaining a higher position as DeFi lending expands. At the end of 2024, more than $49B were locked in lending protocols, which exist on almost all leading chains. While Maker and Sky are not directly competing, the sub-DAO Spark Protocol rose to the second-highest spot, with $4.37B in value locked. However, the Sky ecosystem still lags behind Aave, which holds between $18B and $20B in loans and collaterals. Sky Protocol will aim to boost its position on Solana after starting the inflows of USDS into the new chain. In 2025, the protocol aims to offer full lending services, potentially competing with established lenders like Kamino Finance. Toward the end of 2024, the supply of USDS on Solana increased to over 100M tokens based on bridging data. The milestone was achieved just a week after the launch of USDS on Solana. The main use case for USDS is its passive income, with a savings rate of 12.5%. The supply of USDS grew above 1B tokens in the past year after spreading to multiple lending protocols. USDS can be staked for savings income through Sky, Spark Protocol, as well as Kamino Protocol and Drift on Solana. USDS has also spread to Base, which carries a version of Spark Protocol. Sky Protocol hopes to expand on expectations for a more crypto-friendly climate in 2025. In the coming year, both SKY and MKR tokens will remain deflationary , with no new mints except in extraordinary circumstances to protect the peg of DAI.

38300665,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399761,1735551574,Why XRP Price is Going Down Today & What to Expect Next?,"The post Why XRP Price is Going Down Today & What to Expect Next? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP has been one of the weakest performers among large-cap cryptocurrencies recently, sparking concerns among investors. While the entire market is dealing with a downturn, XRP has taken an even bigger hit, shedding almost 30% of its recent gains. Struggling to hold above the $2 mark , many are wondering if this is a signal for more trouble ahead. Let’s dive in and uncover the factors that could determine XRP’s next move. Why Is XRP Struggling? A key factor behind the price drop is the upcoming monthly token unlock for XRP. On January 1, 2025, Ripple will release 1 billion XRP tokens as part of its operational funding strategy. Historically, such events increase selling pressure, which makes traders cautious about price stability. Macroeconomic Pressures Add to the Strain Beyond the internal factors, broader economic conditions are also affecting XRP. The Federal Reserve recently announced a 25-basis-point interest rate cut. While this move was expected, the Fed also gave a more cautious forecast for 2025, reducing the expected number of rate cuts from four to two. This has added to uncertainty and impacted risk assets like XRP. Traders Step Back According to Coinglass data, XRP’s open interest has slightly dropped, indicating that some traders are closing their positions due to growing market volatility. This has added further downward pressure on the price. What’s Next for XRP? Despite these challenges, XRP has struggled to hold its key support level at $2.20 and has been stuck in a tight range for the past month. This situation mirrors a three-month consolidation phase earlier this year, which ended with a price rally in November. If the current trend continues, XRP might not break above $3.00 until late February 2025. During this period, any large sell-offs could push the price down to $1.58, increasing losses for investors. On the positive side, a change in the crypto market could quickly shift XRP’s fortunes. If it can break the $2.73 resistance, XRP could rise to $3.00 and even aim for a new all-time high above $3.31. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38300593,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=668049,1735551350,Dogecoin Teeters Between ‘Price Discovery’ And ‘Catastrophe’: What’s Next?,"The Dogecoin price is currently down -34% from its December 8 high at $0.4843. But according to crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA), DOGE has one of “the better looking” charts at the moment. In a new Broadcast on X, he offered an in-depth look at Dogecoin, the broader market environment, and key technical indicators. Dogecoin: Price Discovery Or Catastrophe? Despite the current retracement, Kevin believes Dogecoin’s chart “looks really nice at the moment” and appears stronger than many other cryptocurrencies: “This is a stronger coin compared to a lot of the market. I mean, Doge really does look good here. Can it not look good in a week from now? Of course it can, but it looks really good at the moment.” However, he emphasized the possibility of short-term pullbacks—something that could bring Dogecoin down to the $.026 region: “In the short term, could we come back down and test 26 cents? Which I’m gonna throw that out there […] I see no real reason to be uber bearish […] but is it possible that we come back down here? Sure.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Soar To $23 Based On These Bullish Fractals The $0.26 to $0.28 range emerged as the critical juncture for Dogecoin’s near-term outlook: “As long as we remain above this 28 to 26 cent level […] I see no reason to be super fearful. If we pierce that level […] A loss of $0.26 cents on weekly closes would be catastrophic.” Kevin traced this specific target back to November, when he first suggested Dogecoin would revisit the golden pocket near $0.26. According to him, many were skeptical, but that level eventually got hit: “I took a lot of heat for making that call back in early November when we were at 45 cents […] We ended up coming back down and testing that.” Looking to the upside, Kevin pinpoints a substantial resistance area between $0.30 and $0.35, calling it “big, big resistance.” Following that, he labels $0.94 to $1.00 as his “next big zone,” though he cautioned traders against assuming a guaranteed climb. For Dogecoin to breach previous all-time highs and truly enter “full-blown price discovery,” Kevin wants to see a break above the 0.703 and 0.786 Fibonacci retracements—roughly $0.53 and $0.59 cents, respectively: “I don’t see anything holding Dogecoin back from full-blown price discovery […] We want to break 53 cents […] and then the 0.786 at 59 cents. If we’re durably breaking past that 60 cent area, I don’t see anything holding Dogecoin back.” Drawing parallels to past market cycles, Kevin highlighted how Dogecoin historically checks in with its “bull market support band” and macro support levels before rallying: “We came back, we tested structure support […] bull market support band in this cycle. This is very similar to [the previous cycle]. You can’t deny the similarities.” He described how Dogecoin’s present chart mirrors its cycle patterns “almost insanely,” referring to a breakout followed by a falling wedge, an initial climb, and a retest of macro support: “Crypto has this insane innate ability to follow its cyclical nature of performance […] it’s truly amazing, really.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought Over 90 Million DOGE In 48H – Details Despite Dogecoin’s cyclical consistency, Kevin reminded viewers that external market factors and Bitcoin’s performance (which he called “the leader of the market”) could always derail patterns: “We obviously need Bitcoin to cooperate. We can’t have any crazy situations happen globally.” Kevin also examined the DOGE/BTC pair, noting a macro trend line and a golden pocket test: “We have this macro trend line […] we broke through that and we came back in. We’re currently at the bull market support band […] We came back and tested the macro golden pocket again.” He stressed that if Dogecoin remains above this zone on the DOGE/BTC chart, it should head higher. A breakdown, however, could spell trouble: “Kind of like that 26 cent level […] if we come down and break […] it will coincide with a break of the bull market support band and this macro golden pocket, in which case we can be in some pretty deep s**t.” Kevin also delved into macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that could influence Dogecoin and the wider crypto sphere. He posited that the President Donald Trump returning to the White House in January is “very bullish” if it leads to improved regulations, reduced conflict, and pro-growth policies: “We have Trump coming in the office in January, meaning we’re going to have a crypto-friendly administration […] If we can get the Ukraine and Russia war ended, that’s going to be bullish for markets […] We can get inflation back down to 2% and then start lowering interest rates faster.” When And How High Will DOGE Rise Again? From December dumps to Q1 optimism, Kevin noted how market participants often front-run expectations by about a month. He suggested that if January ends up choppy, February might be the point when markets begin their true climb: “Everyone thought October was going to be bullish. October was not bullish. November was bullish. Now everyone thinks January is going to be bullish […] Maybe February is bullish.” When pressed for specific price targets, Kevin pointed to several Fibonacci extensions and the Pi Cycle Top indicator on the Dogecoin chart: “If we break through previous all-time highs, the next resistance zone is going to be $0.94 up to $1.32 […] If we break through $1.32, the next big resistance zone that I’m eyeing is $2.19 up to $2.78.” However, he made it clear that any long-term price predictions depend heavily on technical indicators and confirmations. He highlighted multiple monthly indicators—MACD, RSI, Stoch RSI, and the Pi Cycle Top—as potential signals to exit positions: “I don’t care what the price is at that point […] once we get up into that zone, I’m taking profits off the board. If the monthly indicators start flashing, I’m getting out.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.32.

38301403,https://invezz.com/?p=2410349,1735551216,Bitcoin enters accumulation phase as Michael Saylor predicts $130K by Q1 2025,"In a recent series of events that have captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, Bitcoin has entered what experts are calling an “accumulation phase,” a period typically characterized by lower volatility and a consolidation of price before a potential breakout. This phase is crucial for investors as it often precedes significant price movements, setting the stage for the next bull run. Why Michael Saylor thinks BTC price could hit $130k Adding fuel to the fire of speculation, Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has made a bold prediction that Bitcoin will reach a value of $130,000 by the first quarter of 2025. Michael Saylor ⚡ Founder of MicroStrategy (Parody) @Saylorsatsire · Follow $BTC has re-entered the accumulation zone.In my view, a few weeks of consolidation could set the stage for a massive breakout.$130K+ by Q1 2025 feels inevitable. See you there. 1:47 PM · Dec 29, 2024 7.3K Reply Copy link Read 251 replies The recent record-breaking $18 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options that expired on December 27, 2024, contributed to a temporary dip below $93,000, but Bitcoin has since rebounded to around $93,411, signaling resilience and potential for upward movement. The accumulation phase of Bitcoin, as noted in recent market analysis, suggests that the digital currency is gearing up for another cycle of growth. This phase is identified by stabilization in price action, where large investors, or “whales,” accumulate Bitcoin at relatively lower prices, preparing for the anticipated surge in value. Michael Saylor’s prediction comes at a time when his company, MicroStrategy, continues to bolster its Bitcoin holdings, now representing a significant portion of the total supply. This strategy has been consistent since August 2020, when MicroStrategy began treating Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, aiming to maximize long-term value for its shareholders. Interestingly, Michael Saylor’s bullish outlook aligns with historical patterns of Bitcoin’s price cycles, as indicated by a chart shared by Vivek on X, which maps out Bitcoin’s journey through various market phases since 2011. The chart highlights that Bitcoin is currently in its “2nd Bull” phase, a period historically associated with substantial price increases.

38300673,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53435,1735551075,XRP 2025 Price Prediction: What Your 1000 XRP Would Be Worth,"A recent analysis by cryptocurrency expert Levi Rietveld provides an intriguing outlook for XRP’s value heading into 2025. Drawing from historical trends, current market data, and strategic predictions, Rietveld shared why he believes XRP has significant potential in the coming years. He also emphasized the importance of acting now to capitalize on future gains. XRP’s Recent Growth and Market Trends Rietveld highlighted XRP’s recent performance, noting how it exceeded earlier expectations. In November 2024, XRP’s price surged approximately fivefold to nearly $3, showcasing remarkable growth within a short period. This development has led Rietveld to feel optimistic about XRP’s trajectory as the new year approaches. “Now that we have more updated information on what XRP has done today, I have a pretty good idea of what we can expect going into the new year,” Rietveld remarked. Using this foundation, he analyzed the potential value of a portfolio containing 1,000 XRP tokens by 2025. Why 1,000 XRP is a Key Benchmark Addressing his focus on 1,000 XRP, Rietveld explained that this figure offers a practical benchmark for his predictions. The number simplifies calculations and aligns with the portfolios of many XRP holders, most of whom own fewer than 1,000 tokens. However, Rietveld encouraged investors to aim for larger holdings—such as 10,000 or even 25,000 XRP—if they are looking to maximize returns in the future. Exploring XRP’s Path to $70 A critical part of Rietveld’s analysis focused on XRP’s historical market dominance and how it might influence future prices. He observed that between September and November 2024, XRP’s market share tripled, rising from 1.25% to 3.91% of the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization. Based on this momentum, Rietveld projected that XRP could achieve a market dominance of 20% by 2025. Under this scenario, XRP’s price could increase sixfold from its current value of $2.14, reaching $20 per token. At this price, 1,000 XRP would be worth $20,000. For an extremely bullish case, Rietveld suggested the possibility of XRP climbing to $70 per coin. Such a scenario would elevate the value of a 1,000 XRP portfolio to $70,000. He noted that XRP achieved significant dominance during its peak years in 2014 and 2017, with respective market shares of 16.9% and 18.1%. These historical benchmarks underpin his belief in XRP’s capacity to capture a substantial portion of the crypto market once again. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Conservative Outlook for XRP Despite his bullish predictions, Rietveld offered a more measured estimate for XRP’s value in 2025. He posited that even if XRP captures 10-15% of the total crypto market—which he estimates could grow to $12 trillion—XRP’s price could still land between $20 and $23 per coin. “This price is very reasonable, considering how much the market capitalization has grown in past bull cycles,” Rietveld explained, underscoring the steady growth potential of the cryptocurrency market. Rietveld’s analysis highlights the potential for XRP to deliver significant returns over the next year, particularly for those holding sizable portfolios. While his predictions span conservative and highly optimistic scenarios, he emphasized the importance of paying close attention to market trends and preparing for future opportunities. As 2025 approaches, XRP investors have several possible trajectories to consider, making it an asset worth watching in the broader cryptocurrency landscape.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI emerges as a serious contender in the crypto market, combining real-world utility and sustainable growth potential to outshine meme coins like PEPE. Table of Contents PEPE’s legacy meme coin phenomenon Why LCAI could surpass PEPE PEPE vs. LCAI comparative snapshot Dark horse of the next bull market The crypto market thrives on innovation and speculation, with every bull run bringing new contenders eager to challenge established players. Among them, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is already making waves with its new approach, and its Lightchain AI Presale is now open to early adopters. Unlike traditional memecoins like PEPE, which gained massive popularity during the last cycle, LCAI offers far more than just hype. PEPE’s legacy meme coin phenomenon PEPE shows the perfect tale of meme coin fast fame helped by group joy, fun, and quick spread. With its ease and connection, PEPE caught buyers notice, pushing huge price jumps. But like many meme coins, PEPE has no real use, leaning mostly on mood in the market for its worth While its effect on the meme coin world is clear, PEPE’s lasting power is not sure. Its price often links with short-lived fads, making it very weak to market changes and less trust from buyers when the buzz fades. Why LCAI could surpass PEPE Real utility Unlike PEPE, which thrives on cultural relevance, LCAI provides tangible value by solving real-world challenges. Its deflationary tokenomics, with a portion of transaction fees burned, enhances its appeal as a long-term investment. Market growth potential LCAI taps into the rapidly expanding markets of AI and blockchain, industries projected to grow exponentially in the coming years. By bridging these sectors, LCAI captures a broader audience than meme coins, whose appeal remains limited to niche communities. Sustainability and scalability With energy-efficient systems and scalable architecture, LCAI addresses key criticisms of traditional blockchain platforms. Its eco-friendly model positions it as a future-proof investment in a market increasingly conscious of sustainability. PEPE vs. LCAI comparative snapshot Feature PEPE Lightchain AI (LCAI) Utility Limited to hype Real-world AI integration Tokenomics Inflationary supply Deflationary model Market Appeal Meme coin enthusiasts AI and blockchain innovators Sustainability High volatility Eco-friendly, scalable Long-Term Viability Dependent on trends Grounded in utility Dark horse of the next bull market While PEPE will remain an iconic symbol of the memecoin movement, its reliance on community-driven hype makes it vulnerable in the long term. In contrast, Lightchain AI’s robust architecture, mechanisms, and practical applications position it as a rising star with the potential to surpass meme coins like PEPE. As the market gears up for the next bull run, investors seeking a balance between speculative excitement and long-term value may find LCAI to be the ultimate contender. Could this rising token indeed outshine PEPE? Only time will tell, but the groundwork laid by Lightchain AI suggests it’s more than just a possibility, it’s a strong probability. And that’s something worth paying attention to in the volatile world of crypto. So keep an eye on LCAI, because it just might be the dark horse of the next bull market.

38300323,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399822,1735550808,Here’s Why You Should Be Bullish on XRP Even As It Struggles at $2,"The post Here’s Why You Should Be Bullish on XRP Even As It Struggles at $2 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With less than a few days left until the 2024 end, the markets are facing a major volatility issue as the buyers remain passive. As a result, the volume has dropped to a large extent, indicating the sluggish behaviour of the market participants due to uncertainty circulating around major tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, etc., and many more. While Ripple is expanding its network, the XRP price is believed to have a positive impact. Meanwhile, the current trade setup and the market sentiments raise serious concerns over the upcoming price action. The broader market sentiments are neutral at the moment, as the lack of bullish strength has paved the way for the bears to mount some upward pressure. The drop in the price has been supported by the rise in the volume, suggesting the market participants could be panic selling as the token reaches beyond the 2021 highs after remaining sluggish for a long time. Therefore, the lower targets have been activated, as the price is expected to reach $1.88 if the token fails to defend the crucial support at $2. The short-term price action of XRP suggests the token is primed for a major bearish action ahead of the yearly close. The stochastic RSI has been displaying a consistent trend, suggesting a drop in the token’s volatility. Besides, the MACD remains within the negative range without a rise in either bullish or bearish pressure. As the volume remains lower, there could be a fewer possibility of a breakout. Therefore, the XRP price may eventually reach the ascending support line at $2 after undergoing a small rise to $2.1. Additionally, the long-term price action also remains bearish, as the MACD suggests a drop in the buying pressure in the weekly chart. However, the rally appears to be reaching the lower support of the bull flag pennant, indicating a huge possibility of a rebound. Secondly, the RSI remains within the overbought range suggesting the bullish trend to prevail for a long time ahead. Therefore, if the XRP price sustains within the bullish pennant, a rebound may be initiated with the beginning of the fresh yearly trade. This could further pave the way for the token to march towards the higher targets in the coming days.",NEGATIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/heres-why-you-should-be-bullish-on-xrp-even-as-it-struggles-at-2/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Bitcoin and Altcoins Also Included!,"While 2024, in which important and critical decisions were made for Bitcoin and altcoins, was left behind, China, known for its strict bans, published the 2024 Financial Stability Report. The People's Bank of China also touched on the events taking place in the cryptocurrency sector in its 2024 Financial Stability Report. This report noted that while China was closely following many global developments, Hong Kong was making progress in its compliance with cryptocurrencies. While the report referenced Hong Kong’s progress at many points, it was stated that Hong Kong was actively exploring the management of crypto asset licenses. It was stated that although 51 countries and regions around the world, excluding Hong Kong, imposed bans on crypto assets, some countries softened or lifted their bans in 2024. The Rise and SEC's Bitcoin Approval! In the report, where it was stated that the rise in Bitcoin and altcoins attracted attention, it was stated that the rise started in 2023. The report stated that although there are official bans, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will be closely monitored by many countries around the world in 2024. The report, which specifically examines developments in the US, stated that in 2024, the US SEC took action against crypto asset issuers that violated the Securities Act. “Accordingly, the SEC rejected more than 20 spot Bitcoin ETF applications from 2018 to 2023. However, it approved the listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. While the SEC made a big splash with its Bitcoin ETF approval, the SEC Chairman later said that this does not mean that the SEC approves or recognizes Bitcoin products and investors should still be careful about the risks associated with Bitcoin and value-related products. In addition to developments in the United States and Hong Kong, the report also included the European Union's MiCA regulation and the regulatory efforts of the United Kingdom, Singapore and Japan. As you may recall, China banned all activities related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2021. However, it is claimed that China may lift the bans in the coming years. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: The People's Bank of China Published Its 2024 Report!

According to Lookonchain, the tokens were transferred to a non-centralized exchange wallet labeled “76yGJ,” making the wallet the sixth-largest holder of PNUT. The withdrawal occurred at an average price of $1.641 per token. Over the past two days, another whale reportedly sold PNUT tokens to acquire 60.03 million MIRA tokens at $0.031 each, spending $1.87 million. However, the value of the MIRA tokens has since dropped to $1.2 million, resulting in an estimated loss of $600,000 for the investor, per recent data from Coingecko’s terminal. This move follows a similar trend from December 12, when another whale created a new wallet and withdrew 8.41 million PNUT tokens, worth $10.68 million at the time, from Binance.

PNUT in long-term decline, short-term gain The crypto coin’s market performance has faced considerable pressure in recent days. Its market cap stands at $687 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of $303 million, an increase of 123%. Short-term indicators show a 0.09% decline in the last hour, while long-term data reveal a 44.79% drop over the past 30 days. PNUT market performance: Source – CoinMarketCap Despite garnering an extraordinary 1200% increase in value over the past 90 days, the token’s current price trajectory is showcasing some bearish signs in the long term. PNUT’s origin story as a memecoin is tied to the viral fame of Peanut, the squirrel. Peanut, who gained over 500,000 Instagram followers, became an internet sensation through Mark Longo’s viral videos. The tragic euthanization of Peanut and another rescued animal, Fred, sparked public outrage, inspiring the creation of PNUT and other Peanut-themed tokens. The token gained massive attention after Binance listed the token on November 11. The listing propelled the token to a peak market cap of $2.27 billion and an all-time high price of $1.80. The token’s popularity was further fueled by social media buzz, including mentions from Elon Musk, which helped create the wave to push its price upwards. After experiencing a price and market cap rally, legal controversies and market corrections took a toll on PNUT, and the price uptick that saw investors make millions decelerated exponentially. Mark Longo, popularly known as “the squirrel dad,” issued a cease-and-desist letter to Binance, alleging unauthorized use of his pet squirrel’s image to promote the crypto coin. Longo himself has faced accusations of running scams in the memecoin space, including alleged “rug pulls” in previous projects. Longo’s story is dangerously similar to the infamous Hailey Welch, who is currently facing a heap of lawsuits for the HAWK coin incident. After the news of Longo’s cease-and-desist letter broke, the token dropped 10.2% within 24 hours, falling from $1.17 to $1.05. As of now, PNUT is trading at $0.68, marking a 10.21% drop within a day. The token is currently changing hands almost at its lowest price point in over a month, leaving investors uncertain about its future prospects. PNUT’s upward momentum could continue in 2025 PNUT’s struggles come amid a broader downturn in the altcoin market, which has fueled Bitcoin’s rising dominance, now exceeding 58%. While the crypto market has seen speculative surges, including PNUT’s own 1000% rally earlier this year, maintaining momentum has proven difficult for many memecoins. That said, PNUT has managed to attract the attention of speculative traders. The token boasts over 80,000 on-chain holders and more than $12 million in locked liquidity. Its listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase may keep up a steady flow of interest, though its long-term stability, just like most memecoins, remains uncertain.

The last such example was on December 26 when BTC touched that line but was quickly rejected once again. The subsequent decline pushed it south hard, and the asset fell to $95,000 over the weekend.

38301401,https://invezz.com/?p=2410244,1735550213,Ethereum long-term holder growth hits 75% in 2024: here’s why,"Ethereum (ETH) is closing 2024 with a strong edge over Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of long-term holder growth, reflecting rising confidence in the asset as 2025 approaches. Data from IntoTheBlock revealed that the proportion of Ethereum holders who kept their tokens for over a year increased from 59% in January to 75.1% by the end of December. IntoTheBlock @intotheblock · Follow This chart shows the percentage of long-term Bitcoin and Ether holders over the past year. While the share of long-term Bitcoin decreased, the percentage of long-term ETH holders climbed, surpassing that of Bitcoin early in the year. 7:30 PM · Dec 29, 2024 106 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies In contrast, Bitcoin’s long-term holders saw a steady decline, falling from 70% to 62.3% over the same period. This divergence in long-term holding patterns highlights a broader shift in market sentiment, with Ethereum appearing to attract more confidence amid growing adoption and regulatory clarity. Ethereum long-term holders soar Throughout 2024, Ethereum consistently gained ground as a preferred asset for long-term investors. IntoTheBlock categorizes long-term holders as those retaining their tokens for more than a year. By the end of December, three-quarters of Ethereum holders fell into this category, compared to 59% at the beginning of the year. This upward trend has been driven by factors such as the addition of staking options in Ether ETFs and increased regulatory clarity from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Bitcoin, on the other hand, experienced a noticeable decrease in its long-term holder base. Starting the year with approximately 70% of holders in the long-term bracket, the figure dropped to 62.3% by December. Analysts have linked this decline to profit-taking during BTC’s record-breaking rally in mid-December, which saw the asset hit an all-time high of $106,000 before settling at $93,711 by month’s end. Spot Ether ETFs see $2.1B inflows in December Ethereum’s rise in long-term holdings was complemented by a significant uptick in spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. December saw cumulative net inflows into these ETFs reach $2.1 billion, doubling the $1 billion recorded in November. This robust demand reflects a growing institutional interest in Ethereum as an asset with long-term potential, bolstered by its transition to a proof-of-stake model and growing utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, attributed to large-scale sell-offs by long-term holders, have not dampened optimism entirely. Technical analyst Ger Van Lagen projected Bitcoin could surpass $200,000 shortly, despite its recent volatility. The contrasting trends in long-term holding patterns suggest Ethereum may be viewed as a safer and more sustainable investment going forward. Why this optimism for Ethereum The optimism surrounding Ethereum heading into 2025 is also underpinned by broader market developments. Experts anticipate a Trump administration could favor cryptocurrencies like Ethereum through regulatory reforms, including overhauls of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This environment, coupled with the growing adoption of staking in Ether ETFs, positions Ethereum as a leader in the crypto space. By contrast, Bitcoin faces challenges in retaining long-term investor confidence, as seen in its declining holder percentage. While its role as a digital store of value remains unchallenged, the dynamics between Bitcoin and Ethereum illustrate a shifting landscape in crypto investment preferences.

Data reveals that 75.1% of Ether holders have retained their tokens for over a year, a major leap from 59% at the start of the year. In stark contrast, Bitcoin’s long-term holder proportion has declined steadily, dropping from 70% in January to 62.3% by year-end. This divergence highlights a shift in sentiment within the cryptocurrency space, as ETH continues to strengthen its foothold among investors. Analysts suggest that this growing confidence in ETH stems from its versatility and evolving use cases, bolstered by consistent ecosystem developments and the integration of staking into Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . Bitcoin Holders Cash Out Amid Price Volatility Bitcoin’s struggles in retaining long-term holders were further accentuated by its turbulent price movement in December. BTC’s value tumbled from its all-time high of $106,000 on December 16 to $93,000 by December 30. According to technical analyst Ger Van Lagen, this sharp decline was fueled by long-term holders capitalizing on the euphoric price spike. While Van Lagen remains optimistic, forecasting Bitcoin to surpass $200,000 in the coming months, the current metrics paint a picture of waning patience among BTC loyalists. This change in behavior raises questions about Bitcoin’s resilience amid growing competition from Ethereum and other blockchain ecosystems. Spotlight on Ether ETFs The rise in Ether’s long-term holder base isn’t occurring in isolation. December alone saw inflows into spot Ether ETFs more than double, with net investments climbing from $1 billion in November to $2.1 billion by month-end. These inflows signal robust institutional interest in ETH, especially with developments such as staking integration and increased regulatory clarity under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

38299582,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376622,1735549249,NBA Legend Who Predicted Bitcoin’s Bull Run Now Sets a $1 Million Target,"TL;DR Bitcoin peaked at over $108,000 in mid-December but has since dropped to around $93,500 after Federal Reserve policy updates. Despite the recent downturn, prominent figures like the former basketball player Scottie Pippen predict significant future gains, with targets as high as $1 million. Is It Still Early? Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a substantial rally throughout 2024, with the real bull run starting shortly after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections. On November 5 (election day), the primary cryptocurrency was worth around $68,500, while a month later, it crossed the psychological level of $100,000. The upswing continued, and BTC hit a new all-time high of over $108,000 in mid-December. However, the Federal Reserve’s latest FOMC meeting slowed things down. While America’s central bank announced another 0.25% rate cut, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that the policy might be paused in 2025 due to rising inflation concerns. He also said the Fed is not permitted to hold BTC, casting doubt on Trump’s plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Since then, the asset’s price has been on a downtrend, briefly tumbling below $93,000. It is currently worth approximately $93,500 (per CoinGecko’s data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko However, BTC proponents expect the negative trend to end soon, forecasting fresh peaks. An example is one of the greatest basketball players of all time – Scottie Pippen. He recently claimed that it is not too late to jump on the BTC bandwagon, believing that the asset’s market cap has a lot of room for growth. Pippen placed himself among the biggest maxies , setting a whopping target of $1 million per coin. You think you’re late to Bitcoin because it hit $100,000. I think I’m early to Bitcoin because it’s $1.7 Trillion Market Cap out of a total $900 Trillion in global assets. Next stop, $1 MILLION $BTC — Scottie Pippen (@ScottiePippen) December 28, 2024 It is important to note that he was quite accurate with his previous prediction. At the beginning of September, Pippen said that he had a dream with the anonymous creator of BTC, Satoshi Nakamoto, who envisioned that the cryptocurrency’s price would hit $84,650 on November 5 this year. Recall that the valuation reached the target less than a week later. Other BTC Predictions The list of industry participants who think that BTC has yet to record substantial gains includes many names. X user Mags, for instance, recently assumed that the bull cycle’s peak might occur somewhere between June 2025 and October 2025. The analyst based their prediction on BTC’s performance during the previous bull runs. Jason Williams chipped in, too, suggesting that the asset has re-entered the accumulation zone. “ In my view, a few weeks of consolidation could set the stage for a massive breakout. $131.5K+ by Q1 2025 feels inevitable. See you there,” the analyst added.

Speaking to the German Press Agency in Berlin, Linder compared the new Trump administration’s push on cryptos, calling it “an extremely progressive policy.” He added that the US is looking to become a leading crypto hub. “In Washington, there is even talk of the American central bank adding crypto assets to its reserves alongside currencies and gold.” Linder’s remarks echo a European MP’s recent call for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for Europe. Early this month, the MP lauded El Salvador’s move to invest heavily in Bitcoin . Christian Lindner, who heads Germany’s Free Democratic Party, emphasized the importance of Europe not relying on the US in the field of cryptos. Further, He stressed that both the ECB and the Bundesbank are independent in making their decisions. “But Germany and Europe must not allow themselves to be left behind again,” Lindner added. He also urged both entities to examine whether cryptos like Bitcoin should become part of the central banks’ reserves. “Because crypto assets now account for a significant part of the global increase in prosperity,” he said, adding that the move could contribute to strengthening the resilience of reserves. Lindner also addressed the risks of highly volatile cryptocurrencies. He said that these price fluctuations are well known and nobody would wisely invest everything in them. However, as a decentralized system in which no one has sole power, political risks are calculable, he noted. “And there are also fluctuations in classic assets such as precious metals.” German Lawmaker Urged Government to Hold Bitcoin as Strategic Reserve Currency Meanwhile, the German government has been continuously transferring Bitcoin holdings to various wallets this year. In July, German lawmaker Joana Cotar urged the government to hold BTC “as a strategic reserve currency.” She criticized the selling spree as “not sensible and counterproductive.” “Instead of selling, I recommend developing a comprehensive Bitcoin strategy,” she wrote in a letter to Linder early this year. “This could include keeping Bitcoin in the treasury, issuing Bitcoin bonds, or creating a conducive regulatory environment.” The post German Ex-Finance Minister Advocates ECB to Include Bitcoin into Reserves appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/german-ex-finance-minister-advocates-ecb-to-include-bitcoin-into-reserves/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38302596.jpeg

Sacks, a seasoned tech entrepreneur and investor with experience as PayPal's founding COO and Yammer's founder, is expected to bring clarity and direction to US cryptocurrency policies. The crypto industry views Sacks’ appointment with optimism. Experts like Ryan Chow from Solv Protocol believe he will advocate for clearer guidelines to reduce compliance burdens and encourage blockchain investment. Sacks, a vocal proponent of cryptocurrency, expressed enthusiasm about advancing American leadership in emerging technologies shortly after his appointment. Industry observers expect him to push for policies that align with Trump’s vision of positioning the US as a global leader in the technology sector. However, Sacks faces challenges, including dismantling what many consider Gary Gensler’s overly aggressive regulatory approach . Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC pursued strict measures against major crypto firms, creating friction and uncertainty in the sector. Critics argue this approach hindered innovation and drove blockchain firms offshore. Sacks is expected to work towards creating a more balanced framework that fosters innovation while maintaining investor protection. Despite high expectations, there is still uncertainty about Sacks’ role. His position is advisory, part-time, and does not require Senate confirmation, raising questions about his ability to drive significant policy changes. Yet, his close relationship with Trump could grant him considerable influence over key decisions in the White House. Additionally, Trump’s other appointments, such as Paul Atkins as SEC Chair and Stephen Miran as head of the Council of Economic Advisors, suggest a broader push for a more business-friendly regulatory environment. Sacks will also need to address the conversation surrounding Central Bank Digital Currencies ( CBDCs ) . While not explicitly tasked with developing a CBDC, his stance on deregulation may slow down or complicate any initiatives to introduce a government-backed digital dollar. Critics argue that Sacks might focus on enhancing the existing crypto ecosystem rather than prioritizing a CBDC framework. Trump himself has been vocal against CBDCs, calling them ""very dangerous"" and a form of ""government tyranny."" Whether this stance will hold remains uncertain. Komodo Platform CTO Kadan Stadelmann pointed out that while Sacks’ appointment is significant, Trump ultimately holds the most power in shaping US cryptocurrency policy. Stadelmann believes Trump’s pro-business tax promises, including potential 15% corporate tax rates, could attract companies back to the US. Sacks, in this scenario, would act as an advisor rather than a decisive policymaker. The evolving policy landscape under Sacks’ guidance is expected to include executive orders easing banking access for blockchain firms, the appointment of crypto-friendly officials in key regulatory roles, and possibly discussions about a strategic Bitcoin reserve . These changes, if implemented, could reshape the US financial ecosystem and strengthen the country’s global leadership in digital finance. While the industry remains hopeful, the extent of Sacks' influence depends on Trump’s willingness to follow through on his campaign promises. Sacks' advisory role, though significant, may not be enough to overcome the political and structural hurdles within the regulatory system. Critics emphasize that while Sacks can advise and nudge policies forward, the final decisions will rest with Trump and his administration. In the broader context, Sacks’ appointment signals a notable shift in attitude towards digital assets at the highest levels of US leadership. Whether this results in meaningful policy change or remains symbolic will depend on the administration's commitment to fostering innovation while balancing regulatory oversight. For now, the crypto industry watches closely, hoping for clearer policies and a stable regulatory environment under Sacks' influence.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/david-sacks-named-crypto-czar-what-it-means-for-us-policy,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38299375.jpeg

These include: Resolution of the SEC Case: A favorable outcome in Ripple Labs’ legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could remove a major overhang on XRP, boosting investor confidence. Introduction of Ripple’s Stablecoin (RLUSD): Ripple’s stablecoin could facilitate new use cases, enhancing the utility of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Tokenized Assets Expansion: considering the growth of tokenized financial instruments, the XRPL could become a key platform for asset digitization. XRP ETFs: Approval of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could bring institutional capital into the market. Regulatory Clarity: Comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations in the U.S. and other major economies could foster mainstream adoption of XRP. New Partnerships: Strategic collaborations between Ripple and financial institutions could drive demand for XRP in cross-border payments. XRPL Smart Contracts: Implementation of smart contract functionality on the XRPL could expand its use cases beyond payments. U.S. Crypto Committee: Legislative support for digital assets through a dedicated U.S. Crypto Committee could benefit XRP and the industry as a whole. Ripple IPO Speculation: Rumors of a Ripple initial public offering (IPO) could attract new investors. Global XRPL Adoption: Increased adoption of the XRPL for remittances, micropayments, and other applications could amplify XRP usage. CBDC Integration: Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) projects leveraging Ripple’s technology could boost XRP-related infrastructure. Crypto Market Surge: A bullish market cycle, including an altcoin rally, could lift XRP alongside other cryptocurrencies. XRPL Tech Upgrades: Ongoing advancements in XRPL technology could improve scalability and efficiency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Responses to XRP Projections The XRP community’s responses to Abs’s tweet showcased a wide spectrum of opinions on the potential peak price of XRP in 2025. Aragon Wiseheart shared a highly optimistic view, predicting that XRP could reach $100 in 2025, followed by a correction in 2026 and steady growth through 2027-2028, culminating in substantial gains by 2029. Americanmade615 expressed skepticism about significant price increases, citing Ripple’s regular distribution of 200 million XRP per month as a factor that could suppress price appreciation. This perspective likens the practice to stock dilution, which often puts downward pressure on share prices. Abs’s tweet underscores the diversity of expectations within the XRP community and the importance of monitoring macroeconomic trends and project-specific developments. Whether XRP achieves the ambitious predictions or faces challenges ahead, 2025 will undoubtedly be a pivotal year for the asset and its ecosystem.

Analysts Are Split! Here's Why…,"While 2024 was a year of tremendous increases for Bitcoin (BTC), the same was not true for Ethereum. While ETH showed a duller performance compared to Bitcoin, analysts predict that Ethereum will explode in 2025. However, there is still no consensus among analysts. At this point, CK Zheng, Chief Investment Officer of crypto hedge fund ZX Squared Capital, stated that if history repeats itself, Ethereum could experience a major rally in the first quarter of 2025. According to the analyst, the first quarters of the new year, which came after the US elections and the Bitcoin halving cycle, were the quarters in which Ethereum performed best. The analyst cited 2027 and 2021 as examples, noting that Ethereum increased by 518% and 161% in the first quarters of 2017 and 2021, respectively. “We expect the new Trump administration to issue more crypto-friendly rules and regulations to further stimulate the digital asset class overall, and ETF inflows to increase significantly in 2025. At this point, we predict Ethereum will experience a big rally.” A Rally May Not Come for Ethereum (ETH)! However, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen offers a more cautious outlook on Ethereum, predicting that ETH will underperform amid a hawkish macroeconomic environment and declining liquidity. Drawing a bearish scenario for ETH, Thielen said he expects it to continue to underperform and fail to break a new ATH in 2025 amid a hawkish macro environment. “We foresee a more conservative outlook for 2025. At the start of Ethereum 2025, the hawkish policy may be tested by decreasing liquidity, unlike in previous years. “Following the December Fed meeting, the federal funds rate could stand near 3.9% in 2025, rather than the expected 3.4%, which could lead to a less favorable macro environment for risk assets like Bitcoin and Ether.” *This is not investment advice.

38299181,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399811,1735548388,"2nd Bullish Wave Predicted After New Year: It’s Time For Solana Memecoins and This Utility Token to Explode 1,000%","The post 2nd Bullish Wave Predicted After New Year: It’s Time For Solana Memecoins and This Utility Token to Explode 1,000% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2025, the crypto market could experience another strong bullish wave after the most recent action. Major Solana memecoins like Bonk (BONK) and Dogwifhat (WIF) may trade between $0.15 and $0.50 during January 2025. If they can break through significant key resistance levels, especially $0.30 for BONK, then they could reach much higher price levels (approximately 50% from the current levels). The bullish trend doesn’t stop at the Solana memecoins – institutional and retail investors will adopt more utility tokens. It’s beginning to be evident in new projects like DTX Exchange, which is beginning to provide high gains for traders before its broader launch. BONK Could See a 100% Price Surge in 2025 BONK is currently trading at $0.00003174 but could experience a 100% price surge that reaches $0.00006348 in 2025 if positive market conditions persist in early 2025. This could be its new all-time high after its previous one in March 2023. The projected increase in BONK’s price is not strange, as it has always demonstrated a strong upward trend, with a recent 50.92% increase in value that demonstrated its potential for growth despite all of its previous corrections. For traders targeting more short-term gains, there could be a continued upward trend in BONK that could lead to reasonable gains, even before the end of 2024. However, earlier in 2025, BONK may stabilize between $0.000036 and $0.000043, which could mean a potential ROI of 95.5%. In the coming years (beyond 2025), BONK could reach higher prices (as high as $0.0204), but it heavily relies on community engagement and market dynamics. Another Solana Memecoin, WIF Could Turn Portfolios Green Even though Dogwifhat seems to have reached its all-time high of $4.85 and struggled to maintain levels of $3, there are potential high gains for traders. WIF is trading below critical levels based on technical indicators like the Ichimoku Cloud, which shows a bearish trend. However, the recurrent decline in WIF’s price doesn’t signal long-term losses. Instead, it indicates a chance for the coin to retest its highs. With some market sentiment, WIF could reach its ATH and surpass it in late January 2025. The market may also favor WIF’s trading at $6 by the end of 2025, signifying an upside of 213% from its current price. Similar to BONK, WIF’s bullish tendency is dependent on community engagement and support, which is different from utility projects like DTX Exchange , which provide real value to traders. 1000% Possible Profit Explosion With Utility Tokens Like DTX DTX Exchange stands out as a promising opportunity for traders who care about explosive gains and sustainable profits. Unlike memecoins, DTX Exchange provides utility tokens that attract both retail and institutional traders. Built on the VulcanX layer-1 hybrid chain, they combine user-friendliness with an impressive 1000x leverage feature that helps traders profit from volatile markets with reduced risks. DTX Exchange raised a record-breaking $10.7 billion in its batch 7 presale, attracting over 250,000 traders and selling out stage 6 in record time. Participants of earlier rounds have witnessed up to 440% gains in the past few months, and participants in current rounds are already positioned for 60% profits based on the current price. Profit From DTX Token’s High Price Explosion DTX Tokens are set to explode up to 1000% as we approach the new year. The DTX Exchange platform already has over 300,000 wallet addresses and has showcased a TPS of 100,000 in its test net.

Experts highlight political and economic challenges, while skeptics doubt its feasibility under Donald Trump’s administration . Despite growing support from advocates, significant hurdles stand in the way of Bitcoin becoming part of the US financial strategy. Prediction platforms offer contrasting views on this issue. On Polymarket, users currently estimate only a 29% chance of Trump introducing a Bitcoin reserve within his first 100 days in office, a sharp drop from the 60% optimism seen after the election. This decline reflects broader skepticism surrounding Bitcoin’s role in US financial policy. Supporters argue that Bitcoin could complement existing reserves like gold and oil, providing financial stability. However, critics point to political resistance and complex economic conditions as major obstacles. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant , is among those who doubt the likelihood of Bitcoin adoption as a reserve asset under Trump. He believes such a shift would only happen if the US faced a serious threat to its global economic dominance. Ju compares today’s Bitcoin advocates to past movements supporting the gold standard. Historically, the US resisted relying on a single asset to secure its economy, even during calls to reinstate the gold standard in the late 1990s. Ju suggests that Trump’s stance on Bitcoin could shift if economic priorities change. He noted, “If Trump succeeds in showcasing U.S. economic resilience, reinforcing the dollar’s supremacy, and boosting his approval ratings, it’s unclear if he would maintain the strong pro-Bitcoin stance he demonstrated during his campaign.” Trump could easily change direction without losing voter support if other priorities take precedence. Despite skepticism, advocates continue to highlight Bitcoin’s potential benefits. Mathew Sigel of VanEck recently proposed that adopting a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could reduce the US national debt by up to 36% by 2050. Sigel envisions Bitcoin becoming a dominant settlement currency in global trade, especially for countries aiming to avoid US sanctions. According to him, Bitcoin could reshape global financial systems, offering a decentralized and transparent alternative for international transactions. Meanwhile, prediction platform Kalshi places the odds of Bitcoin adoption as a reserve asset by 2026 at 56% , suggesting that while unlikely in the short term, the idea remains plausible in the medium term. Advocates argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature offers a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risks, making it an attractive reserve option. While Bitcoin’s future in US reserves remains uncertain, the ongoing debate reflects broader conversations about the evolving global financial system. Political will, economic priorities, and external pressures will ultimately determine whether Bitcoin earns a place alongside traditional reserve assets. For now, skepticism dominates, but advocates remain hopeful that the tide may turn in Bitcoin's favor.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/us-bitcoin-reserve-adoption-faces-doubts,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38299144.jpeg

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-the-grinch-trumpgri-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
38299141,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323280,1735547909,"Bitcoin Outlook: $92,000 Critical Support as MicroStrategy Expands Holdings, Trump’s Policies Loom","Donald Trump’s potential Bitcoin stance hinges on the strength of the U.S. economy and the dollar’s dominance in global markets, according to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju. Bitcoin and gold tend to gain during periods of declining investor confidence in the U.S. economy. However, Trump’s policies may prioritize preserving the dollar as a global safe haven over Bitcoin adoption. Some nations, like South Korea, still prefer the dollar amidst economic uncertainty, reinforcing its dominance. While this could slow Bitcoin’s institutional adoption under Trump, a weakening U.S. economy might position Bitcoin as a stronger store of value in the long term. Italy’s Fiscal Challenges May Drive Bitcoin Adoption Italy has approved its 2025 budget, targeting a deficit reduction from 3.8% to 3.3% of GDP while offering tax breaks for lower-income groups. However, national debt is expected to rise to 137.8% of GDP, driven by energy subsidies.

With the EU pressuring Italy to meet a sub-3% deficit by 2026, the country faces economic headwinds. Bitcoin could emerge as a hedge against fiat volatility for Italian investors, providing an alternative as fiscal pressures mount. MicroStrategy’s Ambitious Bitcoin Strategy Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy remains a key Bitcoin supporter, recently acquiring 5,200 BTC at an average price of $106,000 per coin. The company’s holdings now total 444,262 BTC, worth over $41 billion. Under its 21/21 plan, MicroStrategy aims to raise $42 billion to purchase additional Bitcoin over three years. Saylor’s recent Bitcoin chart post has sparked market optimism, reinforcing institutional confidence in Bitcoin. These consistent investments suggest that institutional demand could drive Bitcoin prices higher in the coming months. Technical Analysis: Bitcoin at a Crossroads Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $93,640, down 1.41% over 24 hours, with bearish momentum dominating short-term trends. Key support levels are at $92,100 and $90,400, while resistance is observed at $95,800 and $98,300. The 4-hour chart reveals a downward trendline and oversold RSI at 40, reflecting selling pressure. A double-bottom pattern near $92,000 provides hope for stabilization. Bitcoin must break above $95,800 to target $98,300 and regain bullish momentum. Resistance Levels: $95,550, $98,330, and $100,250. Support Levels: $92,150, $90,404, and $88,761. Indicators: RSI at 44 reflects neutral momentum; the 50-day EMA acts as resistance at $95,550.

On December 28, Saylor posted a cryptic message on social media platform X, referencing “disconcerting blue lines” on the SaylorTracker portfolio, which monitors MicroStrategy's Bitcoin transactions. His vague comment has fueled expectations of another significant Bitcoin purchase on the horizon. MicroStrategy has become well-known for its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, amassing over 192,042 BTC at an estimated cost of $18 billion. This buying spree has coincided with Bitcoin’s price rising from around $67,000 to a record high of $108,000. MicroStrategy's stock has also seen an impressive surge, trading at around $360, marking a 400% increase this year. The company's shift from its primary focus on enterprise data analytics to prioritizing Bitcoin investments has made it the largest public holder of the cryptocurrency. Despite the impressive financial results, MicroStrategy’s strategy has not been free from criticism. Some traders argue that Saylor’s public announcements create market volatility. Once purchases are revealed, day traders often short Bitcoin, anticipating a price drop after the buying pressure subsides. This activity can also trigger a temporary decline in MicroStrategy’s stock value. One trader noted, “The problem with Saylor purchases is that he announces them, then day traders immediately start shorting BTC because they know the big buyer is done buying. Then Bitcoin retraces, and $MSTR stock goes down, not up.” Additionally, there are reports that MicroStrategy might pause Bitcoin acquisitions during a scheduled blackout period in January. However, early signs suggest the company has no intention of slowing down its Bitcoin-focused strategy. MicroStrategy is also preparing significant corporate moves to enable further investments. The company has proposed increasing its authorized Class A common stock from 330 million shares to over 10 billion and expanding preferred stock from 5 million to 1 billion shares. If approved, this would allow MicroStrategy to issue more shares in the future, potentially raising substantial funds for additional Bitcoin purchases. Market analysts believe this expansion will give MicroStrategy more flexibility to pursue large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions without relying solely on existing financial resources. As speculation continues, both the cryptocurrency and stock markets are keeping a close eye on Saylor's next move.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/michael-saylor-hints-at-new-microstrategy-bitcoin-purchase-sparking-speculation,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38298957.jpeg
38298892,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399609,1735547746,Invest In Meme Coins Through Indexes – Is Meme Index The Next Best Presale?,"The post Invest In Meme Coins Through Indexes – Is Meme Index The Next Best Presale? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The best way to invest in meme coins is often through diversification, given their high volatility. However, there are very few avenues for investors to find, allocate, and invest in the right meme coins in the right proportions. The Meme Index presale offers its community the chance to choose their risk appetite and invest accordingly while gaining exposure to some of the best meme coins in the space. What is the Meme Index? Meme Inde x is among the most trending meme coins to be introduced to the market recently, thanks to its index use case. Essentially, the project aims to contribute to the growth of the meme coin category by establishing the first-ever meme coin index, where investors get to choose the type of meme coin basket they wish to stay invested in. Meme Index features four main offerings—all of which are meme coin indexes focused on providing various levels of risk and rewards. The project has a staking element available too, where investors can park MEMEX, the native token of the project, for high APY. The staking rewards will be higher for presale buyers but can also be enjoyed by investors who stake the tokens after the token is officially launched later. MEMEX will also serve as the governance token for the project, as only holders will be able to access the index and potentially make major decisions within the ecosystem. This could include anything ranging from submitting a change request to adding or removing new meme coins in any of the indexes. Meme Index developers have added this to ensure that the project lives up to its promise of being completely decentralized. The MEMEX token has already been audited by SolidProof and Coinsult, two very reputable auditing firms known globally. Choose Your meme coin Index There are four meme coin indexes that the project has set up, each with a different category of projects included. Meme Titan Index This index focuses on tokens that have managed to already establish themselves in the meme coin space. The projects included here have achieved a level of market stability, with substantial market caps that showcase investor trust and widespread adoption. While these tokens are not immune to the fluctuations of the crypto market, they are generally viewed as less volatile compared to newer projects. One may think of it as a large-cap mutual fund, but for cryptocurrencies. This index is ideal for investors who prefer a more measured entry into meme coins without diving into high-risk ventures. Highlights of Meme Titan Index : Established tokens with significant market presence Lower volatility compared to smaller tokens Suitable for steady long-term growth Meme Moonshot Index This category can be looked at as a stepping stone for emerging meme coins potentially on the verge of greater recognition. Tokens included in this index typically have moderate market caps, indicating growing interest and potential for expansion. When your bro is trying to get all Frenzy on you but you know he's more of a MoonShot. pic.twitter.com/BrlP1v6vtv — Meme Index (@memecoin_index) December 8, 2024 These projects may not have achieved mainstream fame yet, but their trajectory suggests the possibility of substantial future gains, which can be a big factor to consider for many investors. Those looking to capitalize on early-stage growth stories will find this index to be an attractive option. Highlights of Meme Moonshot Index : Focuses on rising meme coins with strong growth potential Moderate risk with a balanced reward outlook Great for investors seeking opportunities in maturing tokens Meme Midcap Index For those looking to take higher risks for considerably better returns, the Midcap Index features projects with smaller market caps but significant upward momentum. These meme coins are often gaining traction through active community engagement or innovative utility but are yet to break into larger investor circles. The index represents risk and opportunity equally, appealing to those who are ready to bet on underdogs that may soon dominate the space. Highlights of Meme Midcap Index : Includes tokens with growing community support and visibility Higher volatility but considerable upside potential Targets investors aiming for medium-term profits Meme Frenzy Index This high-stakes category is created specifically for bold investors seeking massive returns while taking huge risks in terms of investments. The Frenzy Index is comprised of newly launched projects with minimal market caps. These tokens are highly volatile and carry significant risk, but their potential for exponential growth makes them a rather tempting choice. A single success story from this index could yield transformative returns, making it an option for adventurous investors. Highlights of Meme Frenzy Index : Includes brand-new projects with rapid growth potential Extremely volatile but potentially lucrative Designed for risk-tolerant investors aiming for explosive gains Presale and Tokenomics As of now, the MEMEX token has managed to raise over $165k, with multiple features across various crypto news reporting sites worldwide. The popularity of MEMEX has been rising at a quick pace too, owing to the growing community size and the aggressive marketing that the team has been conducting. With just 15% allocated for the presale, the developers have attempted to distribute a majority of its tokens towards other important growth-inducing elements like governance, community rewards, and marketing, with 20% tokens each. The remaining 25% will be set aside for staking, ensuring that token holders are incentivized even after the presale concludes to stay invested and contribute to the growth of the project in the long term. Meme Index Could Have a Successful Launch With market-wide exposure under a single umbrella, MEMEX tokens have the potential to become a top choice for all new meme coin investors who wish to safely park their funds into high-profit generating assets even without much knowledge or time to research. With Meme Index, one will be able to directly dip their toes into a category of crypto worth much more than $120 billion while being part of a huge community. This group can help in educating further via conversations and debates on social media platforms whenever there are decisions to be made on important topics concerning the development of the project.

These rare events, popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, are nearly impossible to predict, have catastrophic effects, and are often only understood in hindsight. The crypto industry has already faced several such crises, serving as lessons and warnings for the future. In 2014, the Mt. Gox hack saw the loss of 850,000 Bitcoin , exposing the vulnerabilities of centralized exchanges. In March 2020, Bitcoin’s price dropped nearly 50% in a single day during the COVID-19 financial panic, wiping out over $93 billion. Similarly, the 2022 Ronin Wallet hack caused losses exceeding $600 million, while the Terra Luna crash erased $60 billion from the market. The collapse of FTX in the same year shook trust in centralized exchanges, resulting in billions in customer losses. Looking ahead to 2025, several scenarios pose significant risks. The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC could result in a ruling that impacts not only XRP but also other projects relying on similar legal arguments. If Ripple faces an unfavorable outcome, the market could see severe disruptions. Additionally, fears of a US economic recession remain high. Experts warn that an economic downturn could trigger liquidity crises, bankruptcies among over-leveraged crypto firms, and sharp declines in asset prices. Bitcoin’s role as an inflation hedge would face a major test in such conditions. The outcome of the 2024 US presidential election also adds uncertainty. Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has sparked optimism, but failure to deliver on campaign promises could disappoint investors and lead to market instability. Centralized exchanges, despite being crucial to the crypto ecosystem, remain vulnerable to systemic failures. Poor risk management, regulatory pressure, or security breaches could trigger another collapse similar to FTX , with widespread consequences. DeFi platforms, despite their innovation, continue to face security vulnerabilities. A major exploit could result in cascading failures across interconnected systems. While predicting black swan events is nearly impossible, investors can take steps to prepare. Diversification remains a key strategy—spreading investments across different assets and platforms can reduce the impact of any single failure. This approach creates a financial buffer during unexpected downturns. Conducting thorough research before trusting platforms is equally important. Investors must prioritize exchanges with strong security protocols, regulatory compliance, and financial stability. Independent audits and reviews offer valuable insights into a platform’s reliability. Additionally, self-custody of assets using cold wallets provides a robust layer of protection against hacks and exchange failures. Moving funds offline reduces exposure to online threats and third-party risks. Experts emphasize the need for stricter regulations, decentralized custody solutions, and improved security measures across the industry. Proactive risk management and lessons from past crises offer valuable guidance for navigating future uncertainties. Yet, the unpredictable nature of black swan events serves as a reminder of the importance of caution, resilience, and adaptability in managing risks in the volatile world of digital assets. Staying informed, securing assets, and preparing for the unexpected remain crucial strategies for investors facing an uncertain future.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/black-swan-events-how-unpredictable-crises-could-shake-crypto-in-2025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38298855.jpeg
38298952,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53430,1735547515,Ripple CTO Says He’s Not A Billionaire,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has recently taken to X to address ongoing speculation about his financial status, explicitly stating that he is not a billionaire. This clarification comes amid renewed interest in the wealth of Ripple’s top executives following XRP’s recent monumental price increase. Schwartz’s statement draws attention to his unique compensation arrangement at Ripple. XRP was designed with a total supply of 100 billion tokens. In September 2012, Ripple, initially named NewCoin, was founded by Arthur Britto, Jed McCaleb, and Chris Larsen. The XRP Ledger’s founders contributed 80 billion XRP to the company, while collectively keeping 20 billion XRP for themselves. Schwartz was not a party to this arrangement. Instead, he chose a traditional salary package and a 2% ownership stake in the company. This decision has significantly influenced his net worth, which he previously indicated in 2021 was considerably below $170 million . Financial records and public statements paint a more modest picture of Schwartz’s wealth compared to his colleagues at Ripple. According to Forbes’ 2019 assessment, his estimated net worth was approximately $90 million, substantially lower than other key figures at the company. Schwartz has maintained transparency about his financial portfolio, acknowledging in 2020 that his investments include holdings in XRP, Bitcoin, and various altcoins. Other Ripple Executives Gained Massively From XRP Surges The contrast between Schwartz’s financial position and his colleagues’ became particularly evident during the cryptocurrency boom of 2018. During this period, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen’s net worth experienced remarkable growth, reaching approximately $54 billion. His allocation of 9 billion XRP contributed to this. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse experienced a similar scenario, as his wealth approached $10 billion during XRP’s peak in early 2018. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The discussion of executive wealth at Ripple has recently resurfaced due to significant movements in the cryptocurrency market. Recent reports from Forbes indicate that Larsen’s net worth increased by approximately $6 billion within a month. This coincided with XRP’s impressive market performance that sent it above $2 for the first time since 2018 and made it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Schwartz has been forthcoming about his crypto investment. In his 2021 statement, he expressed satisfaction with his investment outcomes and ongoing concern about the risks. He also noted that circumstances had necessitated maintaining significant exposure to highly volatile assets, and he highlighted having to sell to profit as a downside of his strategy. Schwartz also clarified his billionaire status earlier in 2024, but this has not stopped speculation from community members about how much the Ripple executive is worth.

The project aims to bridge the TradeFi and digital gap with its blockchain-based banking solution. Now, with a growing user base and PayFi protocol designed to convert crypto into fiat in minutes, Remittix could reinvent the payment industry. While Ripple (XRP) emphasizes efficiency and scalability, and Stellar (XLM) focuses on privacy and anonymity, Remittix has combined all these aspects to enable near real-time, low-cost, and transparent cross-border transactions. Let’s uncover why this new DeFi token could replace XLM and XRP in the payment industry. Can Remittix Replace Ripple and Stellar in the PayFi Realm? While Stellar and Ripple offer relatively lower transaction fees, the low value could change depending on network congestion and the transaction size involved. Remittix has combated these issues by ensuring there are no extra charges; it only charges a flat fee on every transaction, especially for FX and wire transfers. Due to its several privacy features, Stellar (XLM) has attracted regulatory scrutiny and has been ultimately banned from various governments and financial institutions. Remittix aims to comply with regulations and deliberately seeks to avoid engagement with the current regulatory framework. Instead, Remittix will operate within it. This approach has made Remittix stand out to banks and financial institutions. On the other hand, Ripple has often faced criticism for its centralized nature. Ripple plays a significant role in network development and control, using the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol. Meanwhile, Remittix is decentralized, ensuring transactions are peer-to-peer. The move has removed reliance on central banks or financial institutions. While Remittix is a new entrant in the DeFi space, its innovative foundations have made it a strong contender in the PayFi market. Remittix (RTX) Capitalizes On Trillion-Dollar Market The cross-border payment market is significantly growing and is set to hit more than $250 trillion by 2027 . Such an impressive increase can only be attributed to factors like the growth of online businesses and globalization. Remittix (RTX) can benefit from this massive growth potential by providing a superior solution to expensive, slow, and traditional transfer methods. By utilizing blockchain technology to enable low-cost and transparent cross-border transactions, Remittix is ideal for firms and individuals looking to make efficient and cheap cross-border transactions. Remittix will not only change the way people transfer money but also enable a financial revolution across the globe. Besides its fast yet cheap international money transfers, Remittix also releases a unique set of tools that will help redefine how individuals and companies engage with the world’s economy. The core of such innovation is the Remittix Pay API, a feature that allows companies of any size to integrate crypto payments perfectly into their systems. Its presale has already seen impressive momentum. This will create opportunities for broader customer access and also allow business owners to take advantage of the constantly growing digital environment. These unique capabilities have already set the tone for a significant presale rally, as the RTX token is currently selling at $0.0167, with the price set to surge to $0.0172 in the coming days. So far, the project has raised over $800K and eyes the $1M milestone this coming week. Remittix Witnesses Increased Investor Interest? Although Remittix is a new project in the DeFi market, its impressive presale momentum highlights its unique capabilities. While Stellar and Ripple hold a better foundation in the crypto market, Remittix’s unique feature could set it on the right path as both XLM and XRP.

38298908,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634299,1735547400,Confidence Grows On FX Guys ($FXG) As Price Consolidates On Solana And SUI,"Are you ready to seize the next big opportunity to profit in crypto trading? The FXGuys Presale is stealing the spotlight, offering unique features that stand out against top altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI). As investor confidence increases and the $FXG DeFi token inches closer to its launch, now is the time to position yourself for 100x gains. With its groundbreaking features and passive income opportunities, FXGuys is redefining how to profit in the crypto market. Thus, it is a good crypto to buy today. Read on for more details! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys Introduces a Crypto Trading Platform That Caters to Traders’ Needs FXGuys has quickly gained attention in the crypto trading market as investors buy aggressively into its public presale, which promises huge returns. As the $FXG DeFi token moves closer to its launch price of $0.10, investor confidence is growing, and you may need to position yourself for expected gains. With many features attracting investors, the $FXG token may outpace top altcoins like SOL and SUI in 2025. At the core of the FX Guys platform is its advanced Trade2Earn program, which rewards traders with $FXG tokens for all trades they execute on the platform – whether profitable or not. As trading volume increases, you can accumulate tokens that could be used for profit sharing or rewards. Furthermore, FX Guys offers staking rewards, allowing you to earn up to 20% annual profit from trading volume by staking these coins. You may also lock your tokens to access unique rewards and participate in an exclusive Trader Funding Program, where talented traders manage accounts with real capital of up to $500,000. What sets FXGuys apart is its decentralized nature, and it does not impose any KYC checks during the registration process. Therefore, it ensures you enjoy a stress-free trading experience. Without buy-or-sell tax, FXGuys allows you to focus on the profits without worrying about the amount of capital you have. All these features are powering the project’s DeFi token rise, with over $3 million raised in presale funding, increasing investor confidence. Market analysts believe $FXG can be a leading gem in the crypto trading market with its 100x growth potential after launching on mainstream markets as SUI and SOL consolidate. Hence, $FXG is a good crypto to buy today . Solana Faces Resistance as FXGuys Gains Investor Momentum Solana encountered several challenges as it struggled to break critical resistance levels , with recently increased selling pressure weighing greatly on its performance. Several attempts to rally have been toned down by the resistance near $220, pushing SOL’s value lower. The diminished buying pressure increased bearish sentiment, with technical indicators pointing to potential downside trends. On-chain activity has decreased, with Solana’s network revenue dropping by 24% since December 1, 2024, highlighting reduced use and a 19% price drop in the past 30 days. SOL traded at $189.42 on December 27, down 2.89% in the past week. FXGuys outshines Solana with its groundbreaking Trade2Earn program, rewarding all executed trades and improving user engagement. Unlike Solana’s multiple struggles to break resistance levels amid increasing bearish sentiments, FXGuys offers staking rewards and intense growth potential, helping boost investor confidence. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE SUI Eyes Bull Run Amid Token Unlocks, FXGuys Steals the Show SUI exploded to a high of $4.88 on December 21, 2024, recovering from a recent crypto trading market-wide drop, hinting at a potential bull run in 2025. Notably, SUI broke the 50% Fibonacci level and now challenges the 50 EMA at $4.42. In the meantime, the SUI network’s TVL increased to $1.868 billion, up 12% in 30 days. SUI was valued at $4.18 on December 27, up 3.56% in the past week. Meanwhile, the Sui Network will unlock 64.19 million SUI tokens, valued at $270 million, on January 1, 2025. The unlock is part of the normal network monthly tokenomics plan, which boosts the circulating supply and could dilute current investors’ holdings. FXGuys dominates SUI by resolving traders’ challenges via its Trade2Earn rewards, a no-KYC policy, funded accounts, and passive income opportunities via staking. Unlike Sui’s focus on scalability and token unlocks, FXGuys offers practical trading solutions, ensuring direct, hands-on benefits for its users. $FXG: The Game-Changing DeFi Token for Unmatched Profits in 2025 FXGuys ($FXG) is now a promising project due to its innovative features and investor-focused approach. While Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) navigate market challenges, FXGuys is building momentum, offering sustainable growth opportunities via its staking rewards, Trade2Earn program, and no-KYC model. $FXG is available in Stage 2 of its public presale, valued at $0.04. Investors are rushing to invest in the $FXG public presale due to its profit prospects. Notably, at the end of this public presale, the token will launch on mainstream exchanges at $0.10, implying a 150% ROI for Stage 2 investors. Thus, it is a good crypto to buy today. As $FXG prepares for its mainstream launch, now is a great time to join the promising DeFi token and secure your position for potential 100x returns.

38298709,https://coinpaprika.com/news/hackers-use-linkedin-to-scam-crypto-users-with-fake-job-offers,1735547373,Hackers Use LinkedIn to Scam Crypto Users,"Hackers have found a new way to scam crypto professionals on LinkedIn by pretending to be recruiters from well-known companies and spreading malware that drains victims’ wallets. These cybercriminals use legitimate tools, such as video interview platforms, and provide convincing job materials to build trust. Despite LinkedIn’s efforts to remove millions of fake profiles, the platform struggles to stop these advanced scams. The increasing sophistication of such attacks remains a major concern for the crypto industry. On December 28, Web3 security expert Taylor Monahan revealed how scammers are targeting professionals through LinkedIn with wallet-draining malware. The scammers create fake LinkedIn profiles that appear trustworthy and reach out to users with casual messages. They claim to represent established companies, offering job opportunities that seem too good to pass up. Many victims are drawn in, even if they aren’t actively looking for new roles. To seem more credible, these attackers use professional tools like the Willo Video platform, often used by crypto companies. They provide detailed job descriptions and interview questions, asking victims to record video responses. However, the platform shows fake technical issues, disabling the camera and microphone. At this point, the scam escalates. Victims are directed to a link with supposed troubleshooting instructions, which actually infects their devices. Once victims follow these steps, hackers gain control over their systems. The attack often includes a fake Chrome update, which, instead of fixing the problem, compromises the victim further. As Monahan explained, “If you follow their instructions, you are f ked. They vary depending on your system, but once you do it, Chrome will prompt you to update. It’s not fixing the issue; it’s fully f king you.” The exact amount stolen through these scams remains unknown. However, the method resembles earlier incidents, such as an attack on employees of Ginco, a Japanese crypto wallet company. Hackers stole $305 million in Bitcoin from the DMM Bitcoin exchange using similar social engineering techniques. The FBI, Japan’s National Police, and the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center investigated this breach, underlining the rising threats on platforms like LinkedIn. While LinkedIn has made progress in tackling fake accounts, the challenge persists. The platform’s 2024 fraud report revealed that it removed over 80 million fake profiles in six months. Automated systems blocked 94.6% of these accounts during registration or shortly after. However, attackers continue to refine their methods, making it difficult to stop them completely. This growing trend highlights the need for increased vigilance in the crypto industry. Professionals must remain cautious and verify the authenticity of recruiters and job offers. With hackers constantly evolving their tactics, staying informed is key to avoiding such traps.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/hackers-use-linkedin-to-scam-crypto-users-with-fake-job-offers,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/38298709.jpeg
38298609,https://crypto.news/?p=14323147,1735547138,DOGE losing ground; This blockchain coin is quickly gaining momentum,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI is redefining the crypto landscape with cutting-edge AI blockchain solutions, offering a unique investment opportunity through its live presale. Table of Contents Market trends: DOGE’s declining popularity Lightchain AI rising star: Key features Why LCAI could be the biggest opportunity of 2024/2025 Start now with presale The cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, with new players challenging the dominance of established coins. One standout contender is Lightchain AI (LCAI), a blockchain coin that’s gaining significant traction. Its new features and real-world utility are attracting attention from investors and developers alike. Even better, the Lightchain AI Presale is now live, offering an opportunity to get in early on this project. Meanwhile, DOGE, one of the most popular meme coins, is feeling the pressure as LCAI and other competitors leverage their advanced capabilities to carve out their space in the market. As market dynamics shift, understanding what’s driving the momentum behind coins like LCAI can provide valuable insights into the future of blockchain technology and the ever-changing crypto ecosystem. Market trends: DOGE’s declining popularity Dogecoin, or DOGE, was first made as a joke coin. It has had big͏ ups and downs in 2024. After a large jump after the U.S. vote for president in November, where DOGE’s worth went up by about 140% the coin has seen a big drop. On December 16, 2024 DOGE was selling for $0.40 which is a big jump from last year but still much lower than its best ever price of $0.73. This drop can be linked to few reasons, like market fixes and more rivals from new coins. Even with these tough times, DOGE keeps a solid crowd and is still taken by many shops which helps its lasting importance in the crypto scene. Lightchain AI rising star: Key features Decentralized governance- Empowers token holders to participate in decision-making, ensuring transparency and community-driven evolution of the platform. Transparent AI framework- Redefines trust by enabling auditable, accountable, and secure AI operations, fostering confidence among users and developers. Memecoin launchpad- Provides a unique platform for creative and monetized meme-based projects. Roadmap with strategic growth- A well-defined roadmap guides the platform through stages, including prototype development, testnet rollout, mainnet launch, and ecosystem expansion. Sustainability and scalability- Focused on energy-efficient operations and scalable solutions to accommodate growing user and transaction demands. Exclusive presale opportunity- The ongoing Lightchain AI Presale offers LCAI tokens at discounted rates, enabling early access. Lightchain AI’s features position it as a rising star in the decentralized AI and blockchain ecosystem. You might also like: Lightchain AI is poised to be the next big token after Dogecoin’s market explosion Why LCAI could be the biggest opportunity of 2024/2025 Whenever a token starts gaining buzz as a potential 100x or even 500x investment, the first question is almost always the same. What makes this project worth believing in? Here’s why Lightchain AI is different. 1. Consensus Mechanism Traditional systems like Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) rely on outdated methods. PoI, however, rewards meaningful AI computations instead of wasting energy on unnecessary calculations. This breakthrough not only saves resources but also actively advances AI development. Plus, it’s eco-friendly. 2. True utility powered by AIVM Gone are the days of blockchains with empty promises and no real use cases. The AIVM is set to drive the next generation of AI-focused decentralized apps, from predictive analytics to natural language processing (NLP). It’s already being viewed by developers as the ideal platform for groundbreaking new projects. 3. The numbers speak for themselves With a presale price starting at just $0.003, this level of innovation is a steal. Let’s break it down for the numbers crowd: A $300 investment at $0.003 gives you 100,000 LCAI tokens. At $1 (a feasible target for 2025, based on the roadmap), that $300 turns into $100,000. For perspective, early backers of tokens like Solana and Binance Coin saw similar entry points turn into huge profits. Lightchain AI brings a fresh, tech-driven edge to the table, following a similar upward trajectory. 4. Backed by a robust roadmap This project isn’t a flash in the pan. The Lightchain Roadmap is meticulously planned, reaching all the way to its Mainnet Launch. Testnets are ready. Validator nodes are in place. Discussions with industry leaders are already underway. The progress is tangible, and the timeline is reliable. Phase 1- Prototype Development and Community Growth Phase 2- Testnet Deployment and Optimization Phase 3- Mainnet Launch Watch out for major milestones in 2024, they’re set to be transformative. Even if LCAI achieves only a fraction of its goals, 100x returns might actually be an understatement. Start now with presale Timing is essential when it comes to investing in a promising project. The Lightchain AI Presale offers a unique opportunity to be among the first backers of this platform. With discounted rates and early access, investors can secure their spot in the future of decentralized AI and blockchain technology.

38298553,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399744,1735547039,Bitcoin Price Analysis: Crossroads Ahead – Rally to $120K or $78K Dip?,"The post Bitcoin Price Analysis: Crossroads Ahead – Rally to $120K or $78K Dip? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Earlier this month, Bitcoin (BTC) made history, soaring above the $100k mark for the first time ever. It was a monumental moment for the cryptocurrency world, sparking excitement and speculation about the future of the 2024/2025 bull market. But as quickly as the excitement rose, it began to fade. A shift in focus towards large and mid-cap altcoins has started to weigh on Bitcoin’s momentum. After reaching $100k, Bitcoin has seen a sharp decline, dropping over 14% in the past two weeks. As of Monday, December 30, it was trading around $93.3k during the mid-London session. On the daily chart, Bitcoin has consistently closed below its 50-day moving average (MA) , suggesting that short-term bears are in control. Keep reading to explore the challenges and opportunities ahead for Bitcoin. A Critical Time for Bitcoin Veteran trader Peter Brandt noted that Bitcoin is at a crucial crossroads. He believes the next move could either lead to a rally toward $120k or a correction toward support around $78k. From a bearish perspective, Brandt sees the potential for a head and shoulders (H&S) pattern on the daily chart, which could signal further downside risk. On the other hand, Brandt pointed out that Bitcoin might be forming a bullish pattern known as the Hump Slump Bump Dump Pump (HSBDP). If you are a Bitcoiner, take a look at this post from several years ago.

Led by major players like BlackRock’s IBIT and MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR), these institutions have been steadily increasing their holdings. On-chain data from Coinglass shows that the supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has dropped to a multi-year low of around 2.24 million coins, reflecting a growing scarcity of Bitcoin available for sale. Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Strong Inflows The US spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to attract significant institutional interest. These ETFs have seen a total net inflow of about $35.6 billion, bringing their total assets to around $106.6 billion. However, Bitcoin’s Futures Open Interest (OI) market has declined by over $7 billion in recent weeks, now hovering around $59 billion.

In an excerpt from the Financial Stability Report 2024, China’s central bank the progress of cryptocurrency compliance in Hong Kong . The report acknowledged how crypto has become a global trend that major countries are quick to accommodate via licensing and regulations. “At present, 51 countries and regions in the world have issued prohibitions on crypto assets, and some economies have adjusted their original laws or re-legislated regulations,” wrote the central bank in a translated report . The Financial Stability Report mentioned several major steps made by the U.S., Japan, Singapore, the U.K., and the European Union in making sure the crypto industry has clear set guidelines and the rights of crypto traders are protected well within the national laws. Hong Kong implements a “dual license” system for virtual asset trading platforms and operators, dividing cryptocurrency into two categories: security tokens and non-security tokens. Security tokens have to adhere to licensing standards listed in the Securities and Futures Commission regulatory framework, while non-security tokens have to follow the Anti-Money Laundering bill . You might also like: Hong Kong vows to finish crypto asset reporting framework by 2026 Meanwhile, financial institutions based in Hong Kong that wish to provide services related to crypto must apply for registration licenses from financial regulators. According to the report, major financial institutions such as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered Bank are required to include crypto asset exchanges in their daily scope of operations. Despite these initiatives, Hong Kong has failed to catchup to Singapore in terms of crypto licensing. Singapore has been praised for accelerating its crypto licensing process, granting licenses to 13 crypto firms in 2024 alone. Meanwhile, regulatory hurdles continue to stall Hong Kong regulators, effectively slowing down the license issuing for crypto firms in the region. In fact, major exchanges like OKX and Bybit have cancelled their Hong Kong license applications without explaining why. As previously reported by crypto.news on Dec. 24, Hong Kong has distributed licenses to seven platforms, four of which have just been approved this month. It is speculated that Hong Kong’s slow licensing process is hindered by China’s influence. Unlike Hong Kong, crypto trading activities are banned in mainland China. To bypass the ban, traders based in China use VPN to access exchanges like Bybit from a server abroad.

38298412,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399638,1735546699,Sui Joins Chainlink in A 30% Surge Amid Severe Fluctuations; New Token Leads With 308% ROI,"The post Sui Joins Chainlink in A 30% Surge Amid Severe Fluctuations; New Token Leads With 308% ROI appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the year slowly runs out, top altcoins like Sui (SUI) have set the bar for what it means to end the year in a bullish manner. Having already reached $4.7 in early December, marking an ATH, Sui price maneuvered through fluctuations and hit another $4.83 just a few days ago, marking a new ATH. As its monthly trajectory reflects a 30% surge, Chainlink (LINK) also joins the trend with a 32% monthly rise, ranking alongside Sui as top altcoins to watch. However, Lunex NetWork (LNEX) is making its own wave in the presale arena as it grants early investors up to 308% ROI, with more to come as its presale revenue grows in value. Sui Price Maintains Bullish Flag Despite Severe Fluctuations The trajectory of Sui (SUI) price in the past two months has been nothing short of impressive. The token previously made a magnificent move by pricing out of its $0.8 valuation in October to hit $2 in early November and over $4 in December. This short-term growth marked a nearly 500% surge for the Sui price. In the past week, the Sui token has been hovering between a range of $4.46 to $4.72, indicating its strong bullish stance despite fluctuations. The token has also risen by over 30% in the past month, while keeping itself stable above the $4 support level. However, lofty predictions from experts like Mags, hints that Sui price may hit $40 or more this bull cycle. Another analytics page on X (formerly Twitter) sighted that SUI token will most likely break through $5, $10, and $20 soon, imitating Solana’s 2021 pump. As investors follow up on these presentations, their confidence for Sui increases, ranking the token among top altcoins to buy. Chainlink Price Follows A Bullish Trajectory— ATH May Happen In 2025 The last time the Chainlink (LINK) token reached an all-time high was about four years ago when it hit $52.88. Considering the current moment of Chainlink’s price, this ATH record can possibly be broken in 2025. Even though its price is barely holding above $25, top crypto trader, CW8900 speculates that LINK will hit $30 very soon. Having climbed above its support price of $15 and rallied above the crucial $20 resistance threshold, LINK token may have a chance at breaking another level, essentially in this bull run. Meanwhile, Cointelegraph just recently highlighted Chainlink’s market cap success and how it may potentially surpass that of Avalanche in this bullish cycle. Additionally, Chainlink price currently holds in a weekly range of $20.11 and $27.77, showing a 9.3% decline in the past week. However, its 32% surge in the past month, shows how strongly Chainlink (LINK) is holding on to its bullish trend. Lunex Network Tops List Of DeFi Coin Poised For A Massive Takeover in 2025 Having spent a few weeks in the presale market, Lunex Network (LNEX) has successfully left a huge impact as one of the best emerging DeFi platforms, with experts forecasting a potential 100x rally upon its launch. However, the optimistic projection around Lunex Network is largely driven by its remarkable presale performance. Having raised roughly $5.6M, the price of the native LNEX token has soared by 308% from $0.0012 to $0.0049. Although the value of Lunex Network’s native token, LNEX, is about to surge in a few days, most of its investment appeal cuts across its presale token’s growth. Considering its ability to facilitate fast, secure, and seamless transactions across 50,000 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and various altcoins, Lunex Network is considered a strong contender in the DeFi space. Its non-custodial framework which connects over 40 blockchain networks while eliminating the need for users to share personal information, increases its appeal. More importantly, Lunex Network offers ultra-low transaction fees and cancels out the need for third-party wallet apps, enabling transactions to be completed entirely within its network. Business owners or merchants can also leverage this network to accept cryptocurrency payments and convert them instantly into fiat. Additional features like an 18% APR and a revenue-sharing model, shows its strong potential for exponential growth among top altcoins to watch in 2025. Can Lunex Network Lead Sui and Chainlink In This Decade? Considering that half of this decade is almost over, Lunex Network may not be able to surpass most established DeFi networks like Sui and Chainlink in the remaining 5 years of this decade. However, with continuous advancement, community support, heightened interoperability and favorable market conditions, this might just be possible.

He has called on the European Central Bank (ECB) and the German Bundesbank to follow the United States’ lead by including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in their reserves. Is Germany about to take the lead in digital finance? Here’s a closer look at what he’s pushing for. FDP’s Crypto-Centric Manifesto The FDP’s latest election manifesto highlights the rising importance of digital assets, mentioning Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies five times. This focus reflects the party’s push for economic modernization through blockchain technology and decentralized finance. Lindner has praised the proactive measures in the U.S. under the Trump administration, which introduced several crypto-friendly policies. In contrast, he criticized German political leaders for ignoring the global shift toward digital currencies, saying, “I don’t hear anything about this in the central debates of the German Bundestag.” Bitcoin as a Strength for Financial Reserves Lindner believes that adding Bitcoin to Germany’s financial reserves could strengthen the nation’s economic position. He warned that Europe risks falling behind countries like the U.S. if it does not embrace cryptocurrencies as a key part of global wealth. This stance aligns with discussions in the U.S., where Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed a bill allowing the Treasury to purchase 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. While experts like Jeff Park from Bitwise Invest believe this plan is unlikely to succeed, it underlines the growing recognition of Bitcoin as a valuable asset. Has Germany Missed the Bitcoin Opportunity? Earlier this year, Germany sold almost 50,000 Bitcoins confiscated by Saxony’s public prosecutor’s office. At the time, Bitcoin was priced around $53,000 per coin, but its current value of over $107,000 reveals a missed opportunity, with Saxony incurring an estimated $2.7 billion loss. Bitcoin’s Market Trends Bitcoin is currently trading at $93,370 , a decline from its all-time high of $108,000 on December 17, 2024. Analysts predict a potential price correction, with Bitcoin likely to stabilize between $92,000 and $97,000 in the near term. Technical indicators, such as the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), suggest the market is consolidating after an unprecedented bull run. With Lindner championing Bitcoin adoption and the FDP’s emphasis on digital assets, Germany is positioning itself as a possible leader in the digital finance space.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-germany-about-to-add-bitcoin-to-their-reserves-hints-former-finance-minister/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Galaxy Research’s Alex Thorn says he sees Bitcoin ( BTC ) surging by nearly 100% from current levels before 2025 expires amid increasing adoption of the largest digital asset by market cap. “Bitcoin will cross $150,000 in H1 and test or best $185,000 in Q4 2025. A combination of institutional, corporate, and nation-state adoption will propel Bitcoin to new heights in 2025. Throughout its existence, Bitcoin has appreciated faster than all other asset classes, particularly the S&P 500 and gold, and that trend will continue in 2025. Bitcoin will also reach 20% of gold’s market cap.” Source: Galaxy Research/X Thorn also believes that Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) will witness tens of billions of dollars in inflows next year. “The US spot Bitcoin ETPs will collectively cross $250 billion in AUM (assets under management) in 2025. In 2024, the Bitcoin ETPs collectively took in more than $36 billion in net inflows, making them the best ETP launch as a cohort in history. Many of the world’s major hedge funds bought the Bitcoin ETPs, including Millennium, Tudor, and D.E. Shaw, while the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) bought a position, according to 13F filings. After just 1 year, the Bitcoin ETPs are only 19% away ($24 billion) from flipping the AUM of all the US physical gold ETPs.” Data from crypto analytics firm Coinglass shows that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) collectively have nearly $110 billion in AUM. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $93,687. Looking at Ethereum ( ETH ), Thorn predicts that the leading layer-1 protocol will see fresh all-time highs next year. “Ether will trade above $5,500 in 2025. A relaxation of regulatory headwinds for DeFi (decentralized finance) and staking will propel Ether to new all-time highs in 2025. New partnerships between DeFi and TradFi (traditional finance), perhaps conducted inside new regulatory sandbox environments, will finally allow traditional capital markets to experiment with public blockchains in earnest, with Ethereum and its ecosystem seeing the lion’s share of use. Corporations will increasingly experiment with their own layer-2 networks, mostly based on Ethereum technology. Some games utilizing public blockchains will find product-market fit, and NFT (non-fungible token) trading volumes will meaningfully rebound.” At time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,420.

By voting in favor of the scheme, they agreed to the freeze date and conversion of the user token values… https://t.co/WaQ0K3Ut12 pic.twitter.com/bxLbKb8He9 — Romy Johnson (@TOOOFAANN) December 29, 2024 Could WazirX be following in the footsteps of Vauld, repeating the same mistakes that left creditors disillusioned? With millions of dollars at stake, the parallels between these two cases are hard to ignore. What does this mean for the future of WazirX and its creditors? Read on. Lessons from Vauld’s Restructuring Vauld’s restructuring, led by CEO Darshan Bathija with Kroll’s support, left many creditors dissatisfied. The plan froze token values during a market slump, enabling higher recovery rates when the market rebounded. While Vauld reported returning $100 million to creditors, they inflated this figure to $200 million during a market surge to mask actual losses. This approach led to widespread frustration and mistrust among creditors. Persistent Issues for Creditors Vauld’s creditors faced additional hurdles. Claims were restricted to frozen USD values, discouraging recovery for declines in real token value. Further complicating matters were unresolved issues like mismanaged funds, lack of proper audits, and failure to recover $6-$8 million lost in hacks before the company’s collapse. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hacks This Week: Pudgy Penguins Phishing Scam Leads the Pack , Is WazirX Repeating the Same Mistakes? Creditors’ memories of Vauld’s failures are fresh as WazirX’s CEO, Nischal Shetty, proposes a similar restructuring plan —again involving Kroll. Critics question whether Kroll will bring clarity to the scale of the issues or if WazirX will follow the pattern of downplaying problems while overstating minor successes. The parallels between Vauld and WazirX have led creditors to demand greater transparency and accountability. They are calling for detailed disclosures, independent audits, and a firm commitment to recovering lost funds. Without these actions, WazirX risks repeating Vauld’s cycle of disappointment, leaving creditors frustrated and distrustful. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38297851,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376627,1735545496,Why Is Ripple’s (XRP) Price Down Today Again?,"TL:DR; Although most cryptocurrencies have turned red once again amid another market-wide retracement, XRP’s price has dropped by a bigger percentage than most and is shaky at $2. Analysts are speculating about the asset’s potential during this cycle and have outlined an important support level that needs hold; otherwise, XRP could plummet toward $1. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView XRP rode the Trump-induced rally like very few altcoins did, going from $0.6 to a multi-year peak of almost $3 within a month or so. However, its run was halted at the beginning of December, and the asset failed to break above $3 and head toward a new all-time high. Although the launch of its long-anticipated stablecoin in mid-December led to immediate and impressive gains , its momentum is gone once again now. In fact, XRP is down by 25% since that local peak on December 17. The past 24 hours have also been painful for Ripple’s cross-border token, which has slumped by 6% and is struggling to remain above $2. Many industry analysts have now outlined the $1.96 support as a crucial level that needs to be maintained in order for XRP to continue its impressive performance. If it falls, though, the cryptocurrency could drop to as low as $1, according to Andrew Griffiths. #XRP Xrp has been trading in what appears to be a bullish pennant. But if this bullish pattern where to fail it would fastly fall into the low $1 range. Being that Bitcoin has topped for the year, we may see lower prices for Xrp. Losing $1.98 would send Xrp into a dizzying fall.… pic.twitter.com/8K9OPp63rc — Andrew Griffiths (@AndrewGriUK) December 29, 2024 In contrast, XRP will have a chance to resume its rally and aim for a new all-time high during this cycle only if it bounces that support line, predicted another analyst – MAGIC. #XRP continues to hold above 1.98 (blue trendline) and it appears to be forming a bull flag on the weekly. If that bull flag fails and price drops below the 1.98 level, XRP could fall rapidly. 1.98 is critical support and 3.53 is the primary upside resistance. pic.twitter.com/hpyXHQXsqk — MAGIC (@MagicPoopCannon) December 29, 2024 The post Why Is Ripple’s (XRP) Price Down Today Again? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",NEGATIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/why-is-ripples-xrp-price-down-today-again/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/38297851.jpeg

Here Are the Details,"The cryptocurrency market experienced a broad-based decline as a stronger US dollar put pressure on digital assets, with XRP leading the losses on Monday. XRP Leads Crypto Drop Amid Strong Dollar, Year-End Uncertainty The token has fallen by 5% in the past 24 hours, outpacing declines of up to 2% in other major cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and BNB. The strength of the dollar, as measured by the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), has historically led to lower demand for dollar-denominated assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and gold. Asian stocks also fell, with the Asia-Pacific index reversing a five-day gain. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures pointed to further losses in the U.S. trading session. The decline came as investors adjusted their positions amid year-end uncertainty. Despite a 47% increase in bitcoin prices in the last quarter, the expected “Santa Claus rally” failed to materialize, with BTC prices falling by around 4% in December. The stronger dollar is linked to reduced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates and cautious optimism about macroeconomic policies. In the current environment, investors prefer traditional investments such as U.S. Treasury bonds and stocks that provide returns in a strong dollar scenario. While the market is facing short-term challenges, some analysts remain optimistic about the long-term direction of crypto markets. WeFi co-founder Maksym Sakharov expressed confidence in the resilience of bitcoin and altcoins despite the current consolidation. “The recorded sell-off is due to the market’s knee-jerk reaction to uncertainties regarding macroeconomic policies,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

38298950,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53426,1735544845,Can XRP Reach $15 by May 2025? Top Analyst Reveals How,"The cryptocurrency market has seen increasing speculation regarding XRP’s potential price trajectory, with some analysts projecting significant growth in the immediate future. One notable analysis is from EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a prominent figure in the crypto community, who suggests that XRP could reach $15 by May 5, 2025, based on a combination of Fibonacci analysis and Elliott Wave theory. Fibonacci Time Zones and Trend-Based Analysis One of the key elements supporting this prediction is the application of Fibonacci time zones. According to the analysis, the Fibonacci 1.618 level suggests that May 5, 2025, could be pivotal for XRP’s price movement. EGRAG CRYPTO noted that it is not certain whether the price surge will occur precisely on or around this date. However, trend-based Fibonacci calculations explain its significance in the ongoing market cycle. Elliott Wave Theory and a Potential Double-digit Target The Elliott Wave theory provides further backing to this bullish projection. XRP is currently believed to be in Wave 4, which is typically corrective. Wave 5, the next phase, is expected to be impulsive, driving prices higher. According to the analyst, historical patterns indicate that Wave 5 typically extends to 1.236%–1.618% of the length of Wave 4 or aligns with the length of Wave 1 or 61.8% of the combined length of Waves 1 and 3. EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis shows that Wave 1 brought a price increase of 63.39%, and Wave 3 brought a significant surge of 570%. Using these figures, the projection for Wave 5 results in an estimated 391%, translating to a projected price of $15 for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and Challenges While the calculations present a bullish scenario, the prediction is still uncertain. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and external factors could significantly influence XRP’s price trajectory. However, XRP is currently in a good position. Donald Trump, the pro-crypto president-elect of the U.S. is taking office in less than a month, and he has already nominated a pro-crypto successor to Gary Gensler as the Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If the new administration ends Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC as many expect, it could be a major catalyst for XRP’s massive rally in early 2025.

38297349,https://crypto.news/?p=14323131,1735544418,Crypto scammers use fake job interviews to enable backdoor malware attacks,"A sophisticated attack is targeting web3 professionals, tricking them into running malicious code on their systems during fake interviews as part of a lucrative offer from crypto scammers disguised as recruiters. On Dec. 28, on-chain investigator Taylor Monahan flagged a new scheme being leveraged by bad actors who claim to be recruiters for prominent crypto firms to approach targets with lucrative job offers on platforms like LinkedIn, freelancing platforms, Telegram, etc. Once the victim is interested, they are redirected to a video interviewing platform dubbed “Willo | Video Interviewing,” which isn’t malicious in itself but is designed to make the entire scheme look convincing to the victims. As part of the process, victims are initially asked standard industry-related questions, such as their views on significant crypto trends over the next 12 months. These questions help build trust and make the interaction seem legitimate. However, the real attack unfolds during the final question, which requires recording it on video. When trying to set up the video recording process, victims encounter a technical issue with their microphone or camera. This is when the real attack plays out, as the website presents malicious troubleshooting steps masked as a solution to the issue. You might also like: Crypto scammers ordered to pay $5m for IcomTech Ponzi According to Monahan, if a user follows the steps, which in some cases involve executing system-level commands depending on their operating systems, it grants attackers backdoor access to their devices. A troubleshooting guide presented to victims to fix a supposed technical glitch | Source: Taylor Monahan on X “It allows them to do anything on your device. It’s not really general purpose stealer, it’s general purpose access. Ultimately they’ll rekt you via whatever means are required,” Monahan wrote. This access could potentially allow malicious actors to bypass security measures, install malware, monitor activities, steal sensitive data, or drain cryptocurrency wallets without the victim’s knowledge, based on typical outcomes observed in similar attacks. Monahan advised crypto users to avoid running unfamiliar code and recommended those who may have been exposed to such attacks wipe their devices entirely to prevent further compromise. The attack deviates from the usual tactics seen in similar job recruitment scams. For instance, cybersecurity firm Cado Security Labs, earlier this month, uncovered a scheme involving a fake meeting application that injected malware, enabling attackers to drain cryptocurrency wallets and steal browser-stored credentials. Similarly, last year, crypto.news reported an incident where scam recruiters targeted blockchain developers on Upwork, instructing them to download and debug malicious npm packages hosted on a GitHub repository. Once executed, these packages deployed scripts granting attackers remote access to victims’ devices.

38297364,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376519,1735544413,How Bitcoin Is Giving The USA and Russia a Game to Play That Both Can Win,"The incoming second Donald Trump administration has extensive plans to cement US leadership in developing blockchain cryptocurrencies and delivering their products to markets. Meanwhile, Russia is using Bitcoin to conduct commerce outside the traditional finance channels in the face of international sanctions. While these developments certainly bear strategic adversarial overtones, the way Bitcoin changes the equation shows great promise. Cryptocurrency provides the world powers with a peaceful competition over technology. It turns out that with Bitcoin , even atomic-era sovereign partners/rivals can settle differences by using money, like civilized people. Russians Gain Ground in Bitcoin Race The United States and Russia have long shared common interests, especially since allying against the Axis powers in World War II. They include a common interest in atomic safety, nuclear non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, and space colonization. They are also both secular states with constitutions that guarantee freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Meanwhile, both are majority Christian nations, with about two-thirds of each country identifying as a person of faith in a traditional belief system. While 20th-century disputes involving the US and Russia involved armed conflict, the Obama-Trump era has focused on de-escalation, demilitarization, and win-win outcomes. That includes strategic offensive arms reductions, economic tariffs on Russian imports, and trade sanctions against Russian financial institutions. Bitcoin adds another domain that deescalates conflict and harnesses it to technological advancement and commercial rivalry. Trump Promises US Will Take The Lead A month after his landmark election victory in November, Trump reiterated his promise that under the new administration, the US “will do something great with crypto.” “Because we don’t want China or anybody else— others are embracing it, and we want to be the head,” the incoming president told CNBC’s Jim Cramer. “We want to be the head of AI. We’re gonna be ahead of AI.” “And we’ve got to produce a tremendous amount of electricity. And you know that,” he explained. “It’s unbelievable when you think that we need more than twice what we already have. But we’ll be able to do it.” The way Trump sees it , in an ideal world, all the remaining Bitcoin would be mined in the United States. Bottom Line for Investors If you thought Redditors racing for Bitcoin drove its price up to incredible proportions, imagine what will happen as sovereign world powers join the fray. Institutional adoption on Wall Street with custody products and ETFs supported Bitcoin’s price growth over the last four-year cycle. Sovereign adoption is here to support its price growth next.

This repayment marks a major milestone in rebuilding trust in the crypto industry after FTX’s shocking downfall in 2022. MASSIVE NEWS FTX begins repaying $16 BILLION to creditors on Jan 3, 2025! Payments expected within 60 days… and guess what? A big chunk of that $$$ might flow BACK INTO CRYPTO. The bull run just got its fuel. Buckle up. #Bitcoin #crypto pic.twitter.com/TwqeXknvYR — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 29, 2024 FTX’s repayment plan was approved in October, and customers with claims under $50,000 will be the first to receive their money. Notably as per the plan the first they will clear the smaller repayments followed by the larger repayments later in 2025. The company plans to return 98% of what customers lost, with many returning 119% of their claimed account value. FTX CEO John J. Ray III expressed confidence in the plan, saying, “We are well positioned to begin executing the distribution of recoveries back to all customers and creditors.” Boosting the Crypto Market This massive $16 billion repayment could boost the crypto market . Many of the creditors are experienced crypto investors who might reinvest their money into digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, driving up demand and pushing prices even higher. Historically crypto market recovers only after massive corrections or liquidity inflow in the current scenario this is a perfect moment for a bully rally. The timing is perfect for the market, as Bitcoin has already crossed $100,000 this year , fueled by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin halving . While customers will get back more than they lost, the repayments are based on November 2022, when Bitcoin was trading at just $17,000. With Bitcoin trading at $93K, many recipients might reinvest their funds to catch up on the gains they missed. Moreover, FTX has teamed up with well-known crypto firms Kraken and BitGo to handle the repayments. Their involvement shows how far the crypto industry has come in terms of reliability and infrastructure, which is a positive sign for investors looking for stability in the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is Bitcoin Price Dropping Today? , A Fresh Start for Crypto FTX’s repayments are more than just numbers it is also a move to regain the investor faith in the company.

38297551,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634656,1735544336,China’s central bank highlights Hong Kong’s crypto licensing push amid global regulatory shifts,"In its latest China financial stability report, the People’s Bank of China highlighted the strides Hong Kong has made in implementing crypto licensing despite widespread regulatory changes both internationally and in mainland China. Now , Hong Kong remains one of the more crypto-friendly cities, even as 51 nations have already banned cryptocurrencies. Hong Kong strengthens crypto regulations despite restrictions According to the People’s Bank of China, Hong Kong has made significant advancements in its regulation and licensing procedures. This progress comes despite mainland China’s continued restrictions on crypto trading and recent regulatory changes to the international framework for crypto assets introduced by the Financial Stability Board. In its annual China Financial Stability Report , the bank highlighted Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) role in regulating and licensing. According to the bank’s report, the commission has virtual assets under two categories for supervision, securitized financial assets and non-securitized financial assets, while it enforces a unique “dual license” system for digital asset exchanges. Major financial institutions, including HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, are also mandated to incorporate virtual asset platforms into their routine customer monitoring processes, and crypto asset businesses must seek licenses from the commission. So far, the Securities and Futures Commission has licensed four new crypto exchanges in December: Accumulus GBA Technology (Hong Kong), DFX Labs, Hong Kong Digital Asset EX, and Thousand Whales Technology (BVI). Eric Yip, the SFC’s executive director of intermediaries, even commented: We have been proactively engaging with VATPs’ senior management and ultimate controllers, which helps drive home our expected regulatory standards and expedite our licensing process for VATPs. We aim to strike a balance between safeguarding the interests of investors and facilitating continuous development for the virtual asset ecosystem in Hong Kong. – Eric Yip Some Hong Kong’s crypto institutions disapprove of the regulatory requirements The Financial Stability Board established an International Regulatory Framework for Crypto Assets, outlining high-level guidelines for crypto asset oversight. Hong Kong has been striving to follow the framework; however, some crypto institutions are pushing back against its SFC’s regulatory requirements. The four licenses granted this December were just among nearly 30 applications this year. Of the nearly 30 companies that sought licenses, only around a dozen are still waiting for their licenses from the commission, as several major platforms, including OKX and HTX, withdrew their applications due to strict regulatory requirements.

Lightchain AI’s key differentiators Lightchain AI (LCAI) sets itself apart in the competitive blockchain space with its focus on real-world applicability and community-centric solutions. Not like a lot of projects, LCAI focuses on the use of the ecosystem, from its shared control plan to its meme coin launchpad which helps in new ways to earn money online. The project also puts more weight on keeping things going with changing tokens that ensure long-term growth. By looking at usual blockchain problems like size and ease of use, Lightchain AI makes itself as a game changer, making it a strong choice for people wanting new ideas and real answers in the decentralized tech world. Why Lightchain AI is a 2025 power play Here’s why it’s a must-have in every forward-thinking portfolio. Memecoin launchpad where creativity gets paid Think of it as Shark Tank, but for meme coins. Lightchain AI’s meme coin launchpad is where developers and creators let their imaginations run wild and actually get rewarded for it.

38296950,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399631,1735543516,ETH’s Bull Run Has Big Money Moving Into PEPE and RBLK – Here’s Why,"The post ETH’s Bull Run Has Big Money Moving Into PEPE and RBLK – Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2024 Ethereum (ETH) was vastly outperformed by other Layer 1 competitors such as Solana and Cardano. However, analysts expect an explosive 2025 for the second-largest cryptocurrency as accumulation continues. Meanwhile, Pepe (PEPE) and Rollblock (RBLK) continue to gain significant traction , as the latter could prove to be one of the best sleeper plays of 2025. With a revolutionary GambleFi platform, and an intriguing reward system, Rollblock is ready to make waves and redefine crypto gambling. Rollblock Is Set To Disrupt The $450 Billion Gambling Industry How Rollblock Builds A Bulletproof Track Record Rollblock’s community-backed Web3 casino has been in business for over 8 months and is already generating substantial revenue. In such a short amount of time, tens of thousands of players worldwide have made it their go-to platform. In December alone, registration and deposits tripled , and over $1.3 million in bets has been wagered. This indicates exponential growth in popularity and activity, making Rollblock the hottest emerging GambleFi project. GambleFi Explained At the intersection between online gambling and DeFi, is GambleFi. Users are not just players, they effectively become stakeholders through the casino’s native token — RBLK. Holding the token will allow them to reap incredible rewards and play a crucial role in Rollblock’s success. Let’s discover how the RBLK token changes the game and sets Rollblock miles ahead of other competitors in the online gambling space. Discover Rollblock’s Tokenomics The RBLK token powers various functions within the ecosystem and is designed with long-term growth and stability in mind. Here’s a breakdown of its main features: Revenue-Sharing Mechanisms: Every week, Rollblock reinvests up to 30% of its profits in open-market buybacks of the RBLK token. Constant Supply Reduction: 60% of these tokens are burned and removed from circulation, allowing for sustainable growth, while ensuring price stability in times of increased volatility. Staking Rewards: The remaining 40% of RBLK is redistributed to holders for staking their tokens on the platform. This will allow them to enjoy a passive income stream with market-beating APY . This model not only rewards long-term engagement, but investors will also benefit from scarcity-driven appreciation, elevating RBLK as one of the most attractive investments of 2025. What Can Newcomers Expect From Rollblock Rollblock boasts a well-rounded platform that appeals to every type of player. Over 7,000 games await on arrival, ranging from casino classics like roulette and blackjack, to live games and exclusive AI-powered games. A sports betting option has been recently added allowing participants to bet on their favorite sports and leagues, including NFL, UFC, NBA, and many more. Over one hundred new games will be released next year, further expanding Rollblock’s already vast offering. A Commitment To Safety And Trust The online casino space has been facing issues of lack of transparency and security for years, which have eroded trust and driven users away en masse. Rollblock’s blockchain-based framework solves this, as all transactions are immutably recorded, easily traceable, and immune to tampering. SolidProof has audited Rollblock’s smart contract and recently, the casino has also secured a license from Anjouan Gaming, ensuring compliance with the latest regulatory standards. Ethereum’s Price Stalls, But Blackrock Is Ecstatic After multiple failed attempts at overcoming the critical $4,000 resistance, Ethereum (ETH) entered a descending channel as market turbulence intensified. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,355 with minimal fluctuations in either direction. In the last month alone, Ethereum has shed over 16% in value after forming a local peak of around $4,000. Meanwhile, institutional investors are taking advantage of this dip, as Ethereum’s ETFs are seeing record inflows. Since November, Blackrock’s Ethereum ETF has recorded over $1.5 billion in net inflows. Pepe Ready For A Breakout? Pepe has emerged as one of the leading memecoins despite experiencing significant volatility. In the past month, Pepe’s value dropped by nearly 13% which led to a breakdown below the key $0.000020 support. On higher timeframes, Pepe’s performance also appears bearish, however, analysts believe that a price reversal is imminent, as the bottom seems to be in. Experts point out that a bullish megaphone pattern is forming on the Pepe chart, which is foreshadowing an upward surge. If a breakout is confirmed, Pepe’s price could soar to new heights, with the next major target being $0.000032 in Q1 2025. Join The Rollblock Presale Before The 50x Moonshot! While both Ethereum and Pepe will likely see impressive rallies as the cycle progresses, Rollblock could become next year’s crypto dark horse. Its low market cap and cutting-edge GambleFi platform reveal a perfect growth formula that could see the price of RBLK skyrocket by 50x when the bull run is in full swing.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/homosexual-pepe-homopepe-solana-memecoin-to-surge-18000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-dogecoin-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The ADA’s bullish upswing since November 4, which coincided with the re-election of Donald Trump, has confined macro bullish outlook via a weekly higher high and higher low. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $39 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $871 million, has experienced a significant resistance above $1.24. From a technical analysis standpoint, ADA’s price faces midterm bearish sentiment before enough buyers enforce a bullish outlook, potentially in the first half of 2025. Midterm Targets for ADA In the daily timeframe, Cardano price has been forming a potential head and shoulder pattern after hitting the upper border of the multi-month megaphone consolidation. With the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) having formed a bearish divergence, ADA’s price is well positioned to drop in the coming days before rebounding in the first quarter of 2025. Furthermore, ADA price has consistently closed below the 50-day Moving Average (MA) signaling a notable decline in the previously bullish momentum. In case of further crypto selloff, ADA price should find a solid support range between 77 cents and 68 cents. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH About to Explode-May Form A New ATH in Q1 2025 , Fundamentals to Consider The Cardano network has grown to a vibrant web3 ecosystem, with over $433 million in total value locked (TVL) and over $22 million in stablecoins market cap.

XRP sunk more than 5% in the past 24 hours, with dogecoin (DOGE), Solana’s SOL, ether (ETH) and BNB falling as much as 2%. Overall market capitalization fell 3%, while the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index tracking the largest tokens, minus stablecoins, shed 3.5%.    US equities declined on Friday and as investors trimmed positions amid uncertainty heading into year-end. An Asia Pacific index reversed 5-day gains, while futures contracts on U.S. indexes S&P 500 and Nasdaq pointed to losses in the U.S. session as of Asian afternoon hours.    BTC has historically moved in the opposite direction of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, including the euro.    Strength in the dollar largely comes ahead of President-elect Donald Trump stepping into office in late January, where he has promised several policies to help the economy in the coming years.    When the dollar strengthens, dollar-denominated assets become more attractive compared to cryptocurrencies. Investors prefer traditional investments like U.S. Treasuries or stocks, which yield returns in a strong dollar environment.    That, however, has dampened hopes of a continual crypto rally amid lower liquidity and year-end profit-taking among investors. A “Santa rally,” a colloquial term for bullish seasonality seen in December, has failed with a nearly 4% drop in BTC prices this month (it is still up 47% in the final quarter, data shows).    Elsewhere, scaled back expectations for continual interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have contributed to a fall in bitcoin and crypto prices in the past month.    Some, however, remain optimistic about long-term crypto policies helping bump the market despite the lack of rate cuts or a strong dollar.    “Unlike what many believe, Bitcoin and altcoins have not hit their price tops despite the ongoing consolidation fueled by the interest rate cut last week,” Maksym Sakharov, co-founder of WeFi, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “The selloffs recorded stem from the knee-jerk reaction by the market to uncertainties associated with macroeconomic policies. The Fed is preparing for higher figures next year despite inflation close to the 2% annual benchmark. This might shift the direction of monetary policy and impact the market.    “But when US President-elect Donald Trump takes office in the coming year, more corporate firms will enter the Bitcoin ecosystem as the regulations become favorable. If these projections play out, the price of Bitcoin may also decouple from macroeconomic factors that generally trigger its intense volatility,” Sakharov added.",NEGATIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/30/xrp-sinks-5-to-lead-crypto-losses-as-strong-dollar-rattles-bitcoin-bulls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54bc9ddceb3ee9b421bf9e422799b5252a32881a-984x633.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Amidst declined volumes, the blockchain saw a 43% surge in buyers to 63,000, while wash trading plunged significantly by 80% to $21.56 million. Bitcoin’s NFT space revealed similar trends, with sales down 30% to $28 million. Nonetheless, a 52% buyer increase to 59,310 signals notable user growth. Also, Solana, ImmutableX, and Mythos Chain demonstrated resilience, while Pudgy Penguins led the downside with significant dips. Pudgy Penguins has seen plunges across all indicators, with sales, transactions, and buyer participation down 77%, 72%, and 70%. However, the latest developments suggest possible resurgences, with improved performance for associated projects in the coming months. Decentraland’s impressive developer activity forms a massive groundwork for renewing trust, making the platform lucrative for investors. Developer participation is among the top indicators of the project’s future outlook. Such sentiments could wake MANA price from its bearish slumber.

Will It Be Implemented?,"As Donald Trump is expected to take office as US President, his promise of a national Bitcoin reserve continues to set an example for the entire world. At this point, while the BTC reserve discussion has come to the fore in many countries, Hong Kong, which is on its way to becoming a cryptocurrency center, has also joined these discussions. A Hong Kong lawmaker has proposed including Bitcoin in Hong Kong's financial reserves, local news agency Wenweipo reported. Accordingly, Hong Kong Legislative Council member Johnny Ng put forward a proposal that included utilizing the “one country, two systems” framework to include Bitcoin in Hong Kong's reserves. Stating that holding a significant amount of Bitcoin is now mandatory to have a significant economy, the lawmaker suggested that the Exchange Fund buy Bitcoin and hold it for a long time in order to encourage the development of the cryptocurrency sector in Hong Kong, attract more funds and generate more transaction stamp duty revenue. Noting that the current fiscal deficit in Hong Kong has exceeded 100 billion yuan ($13.7 billion), MP Ng said that holding small amounts of Bitcoin will not be a solution to the fiscal deficit, but if a significant amount of BTC is purchased, it can be useful to reduce the fiscal deficit. “Hong Kong should explore ways to incorporate Bitcoin into its foreign exchange reserves by taking advantage of the ‘one country, two systems’ principle. Buying Bitcoin can help stabilize the financial system. At this point, the Hong Kong government can use Bitcoin as a way to strengthen the financial system. Considering that the current fiscal deficit exceeds 100 billion yuan (about 20 trillion won), holding only a small amount of Bitcoin will not significantly help reduce the deficit.” *This is not investment advice.

According to Tokenomist , the first in the unlock cycle is SUI, with $263.20 million in tokens scheduled to be unlocked, amounting to 2.19% of its circulating supply. This event is expected to occur approximately one day from now. Likewise, $58.61 million worth of Optimism ( OP ) tokens, or 2.32% of the total supply, will be unlocked within hours. Then comes Zeta Chain ( ZETA ), with $31.22 million, or 9.35% of its supply, that will be released in the same timeframe.

The Kaspa ( KAS ) token, on the other hand, will unlock $21.39 million worth of tokens within the next six days, making up 0.72% of its circulating supply. These releases crowd circulating supply and can push up prices, trading volumes, and liquidity through the market.

Unmatched by the current 1 block/s and the plan to achieve 10 or even 100 block/s, KAS is built for high-throughput financial applications, with speed, scalability, and security as its pillars, and features like directed acyclic graph (DAG) topology querying, data pruning, and SPV proofs and layer 2 subnetworks.

These events raise a token’s circulating supply, which can impact its price in a scenario where market demand cannot absorb the newly issued tokens. Because they affect market dynamics, transparency, and investor sentiment, unlock is essential. Big unlocks can indicate selling pressure and affect near-term prices, while the others might drive ecosystem growth by funding development or incentivizing participation.

38299140,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323277,1735541684,Crypto Hackers Pose as Recruiters to Spread Malware and Steal Wallets,"Crypto hackers have adopted a sophisticated new scam to infiltrate victims’ devices and steal funds, posing as recruiters from reputed cryptocurrency firms offering lucrative salaries. According to blockchain investigator Taylor Monahan , the attackers target individuals by advertising roles with salaries ranging between $200,000 and $350,000, luring them into their trap. Hackers Use New Approach to Distribute Malware Unlike traditional phishing scams, the hackers use an innovative approach to distribute malware. Victims are instructed to resolve a microphone or video access issue during a supposed interview process. The fake recruiters conduct lengthy written interviews before asking the final question, which requires a video response recorded through the “Willo | Video Interviewing” platform. When victims encounter technical difficulties, they are guided to “fix” the issue by clearing their browser cache, prompting Chrome to restart. However, this “fix” delivers malware that grants the attackers backdoor access to the victim’s devices, enabling them to drain crypto wallets or cause further damage. Monahan warns that the malware is effective across Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems, making it a widespread threat. She explains, “If you follow their instructions, you are compromised.” They'll message via Linkedin (or where ever) for a bit and get some background on you. Eventually, after some back-and-forth, theyll drop a link to continue the process. The site—""Willo | Video Interviewing""—is clean. It feels like something a crypto co / startup would use. pic.twitter.com/0VRzfnL9J5 — Tay (@tayvano_) December 28, 2024 The attackers are reaching victims through LinkedIn, freelancer websites, Discord, and Telegram, using fake job listings for positions such as business development managers, analysts, and researchers at prominent firms like Gemini and Kraken. The interview questions appear legitimate, probing candidates on industry trends and strategies to expand partnerships in regions like Southeast Asia or Latin America. However, the intent is to build trust before launching the malware attack. For those who may have fallen victim, Monahan advises wiping the infected computer to prevent further exploitation. She also urges the community to remain cautious and skeptical of unsolicited job offers, emphasizing the need for vigilance in the face of increasingly sophisticated scams. Crypto Industry Lost $1.49B to Hacks and Fraud in 2024 As reported, the crypto industry witnessed losses totaling $1.49 billion in 2024 due to hacks and fraud, marking a 17% decrease from 2023. According to a report by blockchain security platform Immunefi, hacks were overwhelmingly the primary cause, accounting for $1.47 billion or 98.1% of the total losses across 192 incidents. Fraud, including rug pulls and scams, represented just 1.9% of the losses at $28 million, though this category saw a 72% increase year-on-year. The decline in total crypto losses reflects improved security measures, as the number of successful attacks also fell by 27.5%, from 320 in 2023 to 232 in 2024. Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange suffered a $305 million private key breach in May, while WazirX, India’s top crypto exchange, lost $235 million in July after hackers compromised its Ethereum-based multisig wallet. Together, these two events accounted for 36% of the total losses. Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols remained prime targets, representing 51.4% of the losses, while centralized finance (CeFi) platforms accounted for 48.6%. Notably, CeFi losses surged by 77.5% year-on-year, reaching $726 million. Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain were the most attacked blockchains, with Ethereum facing 104 incidents that led to 44% of total chain losses.

38297982,https://invezz.com/?p=2409943,1735541509,"El Salvador now holds 6,000 BTC: can Bitcoin success story sustain?","El Salvador, the pioneering nation that made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, has surpassed 6,000 BTC in its treasury, valued at $561.3 million as of the latest update. This milestone represents not only a strategic accumulation effort but also a bold economic experiment under President Nayib Bukele’s leadership. With a 105% unrealised return on its Bitcoin holdings, the country’s foray into cryptocurrency seems profitable on paper. Questions remain about the sustainability of this strategy, particularly as global economic conditions and crypto market volatility pose ongoing challenges. El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey El Salvador became a global crypto pioneer on 6 September 2021, adopting Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the US dollar. Its initial investment of 200 BTC has since grown through consistent purchases, including a $1 million buy after securing a $1.4 billion agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These investments have elevated El Salvador to the sixth-largest Bitcoin-holding nation, alongside powerhouses such as the United States and China. Despite facing criticism from institutions like the IMF, Bukele’s administration doubled down on its Bitcoin strategy, implementing a daily BTC purchase program. This unwavering commitment has paid off during the recent cryptocurrency market recovery, with the nation’s portfolio experiencing a significant unrealised gain of $152 million. The National Bitcoin Office has spearheaded this initiative, tracking and publicising data through Nayib Tracker. Over the past month alone, the country added 53 BTC, valued at $4.95 million, highlighting its systematic approach to accumulation. These purchases have not only bolstered the treasury but also validated Bukele’s economic gamble—at least for now. Can Bitcoin growth be maintained? While El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment has seen a financial turnaround, its long-term success hinges on several factors. The nation’s average acquisition cost of $45,465 per BTC raises questions about the sustainability of profits if market prices falter. The cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility could undermine the government’s ability to leverage its holdings during economic downturns. The $1.4 billion IMF deal provides temporary fiscal breathing room but also places pressure on the administration to demonstrate the viability of Bitcoin as an economic pillar. Critics argue that relying heavily on a speculative asset may expose the country to risks, particularly in the absence of diversified revenue streams. Furthermore, global macroeconomic conditions remain a critical factor. With central banks tightening monetary policies and economic growth slowing in key markets, cryptocurrency adoption and valuations could face headwinds. El Salvador’s crypto-centric strategy may also complicate relationships with international lenders, potentially limiting access to future funding. What’s next for El Salvador’s Bitcoin ambitions? As the country surpasses 6,000 BTC, valued at over half a billion dollars, its achievements are undeniably remarkable. Sustaining these gains requires careful navigation of market dynamics and economic policies. The administration’s success in using Bitcoin to stimulate growth, attract investment, and maintain financial stability will determine whether El Salvador’s gamble sets a global precedent or becomes a cautionary tale. By focusing on expanding initiatives through the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador has an opportunity to solidify its position as a leader in crypto adoption. However, balancing this ambition with fiscal prudence will be crucial as the world watches this unprecedented experiment unfold.

Bitcoin’s volatility and smaller market size present challenges for government adoption. Bitcoin’s low transaction costs could make it a better alternative to gold for diversification. Hong Kong legislator Johnny Ng has a new idea to help address the region’s financial deficit: include Bitcoin in the city’s foreign exchange (FX) reserves, citing sources from local media . As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Issues Relating to the Development of Web3 and Virtual Assets, Ng stated that the current fiscal deficit, which surpasses 100 billion yuan ($13.7 billion), could be eased with a substantial amount of Bitcoin. He added that holding a Bitcoin reserve could help preserve value, but only a larger allocation would lead to fiscal benefits. Global Trends and Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Ng’s suggestion aligns with broader global trends. Smaller nations have already embraced Bitcoin as a reserve asset, using it as legal tender.

38295663,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399478,1735540680,Why XRP Price Is Poised for a Massive Rally Amid Market Uncertainty?,"The post Why XRP Price Is Poised for a Massive Rally Amid Market Uncertainty? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A prominent analyst Armando Pantoja, who is an IBM blockchain award recipient and the member of the Benzinga crypto advisory board, has urged investors to stop doubting over XRP amidst the prevailing market uncertainty over the token. Explosive Run Imminent? In a recent X post, the analyst has urged the investors to stop doubting XRP and has shared several reason as to why he believes an XRP explosive run is on the horizon. These remarks come as XRP, which saw a 284% rally in November, is now experiencing a slowdown in its bullish trend amid ongoing consolidation in the broader crypto market. Stop doubting $XRP : XRP shocked the world in 2017, rising from $0.003 to $3.31 something critics said could ""never happen"". It surged 110,000%, turning $1,000 into $1.1 million in just 1 year. Now the lawsuits soon over + Trump is coming. It's time to shine #XRP pic.twitter.com/gXxtnG8nGJ — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) December 28, 2024 While many experts are optimistic that XRP could soon resume its uptrend, the current range-bound phase has triggered uncertainty among investors, leading to profit-taking trades. As per recent data, XRP Exchange Reserve on Binance has spiked from 2.79 billion tokens on Dec. 16 to the current figure of 2.93 billion. The rise in Binance exchange reserves suggests that market participants are depositing assets for sale on the platform. Despite this, Pantoja has urged investors to stop doubting XRP. Where This Uncertainty Stems From? The mountain uncertainty around XRP has emerged as it underperformed during the 2021 bull run and in the early stages of the ongoing bull market. Even market veteran Raoul Pal has warned that XRP investors might miss out on the current bull run, advising them to seek gains elsewhere. After its impressive performance following a Trump win in the US elections, the pessimism around XRP has yet again resurfaced. Nevertheless, some analyst have predicted higher targets for XRP, such as the $27 mark and a bold $33 price levels, but many consider these predictions to be unrealistic. However, despite some believing that XRP’s uptrend might have exhausted, Pantoja remains optimistic, as he pointed out to the altcoin’s explosive run in the 2017/2018 cycle as a key reason behind his optimism. Notably, XRP traded as low as $0.003 in January 2017, falling while other assets surged at the start of the bull run. XRP Set To Outperform The Market? Strikingly, once it broke out, XRP outperformed the rest of the market, as it rallied from the $0.003 low to the $3.31 all-time high in January 2018. This marked an explosive 110,233% increase within a year. Pantoja remarked that, with this rally, XRP transformed $1,000 to $1.1 million. The historic run highlighted XRP’s potential which has now fueled confidence among analysts. He also noted other catalysts that could lead to a similar explosive run, like the possible conclusion of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, and a new pro-crypto leadership incoming in January 2025. Trump has promised to establish a more crypto-friendly administration, with his inauguration in January 2025 expected to trigger another market rally. At press time, XRP is currently changing hands for $2.16, up 10.71% in December despite the ongoing volatility.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-xrp-price-is-poised-for-a-massive-rally-amid-market-uncertainty/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Meanwhile, pro-crypto policies face some urgency with a two-year legislative window under the incoming Trump administration. However, a controversial new IRS rule classifying DeFi front-ends as brokerages has sparked widespread criticism, legal challenges, and concerns over innovation and decentralization in the industry. US Government to Hold Bitcoin Stockpile Galaxy Digital’s research division projected that the United States government will not purchase additional Bitcoin (BTC) in 2025 but will focus more on safeguarding its existing holdings. According to Alex Thorn, Galaxy’s head of research, the US government will instead explore a Bitcoin reserve policy by using its current stockpile of close to 183,850 BTC, which is valued at around $17.24 billion. While discussions on adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset will continue, the government seems poised to rely on its existing holdings rather than buying more. US government crypto holdings (Source: Spot On Chain ) Thorn shared that there will likely be movements in federal departments and agencies to examine the implications of an expanded Bitcoin reserve policy. This aligns with Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act 2024, which is a proposed bill that, if passed, would authorize the US government to accumulate 200,000 BTC annually over five years. This will eventually create a reserve of 1 million Bitcoin to be held for at least two decades. Galaxy Digital analysts believe that the US adopting a stronger Bitcoin stance could also spur some global competition among nation-states. Analyst “JW” speculated that unaligned nations, adversaries of the US, or those with large sovereign wealth funds might adopt strategies to mine or buy Bitcoin in response. The potential for Bitcoin adoption could also extend to the corporate world, with up to five Nasdaq 100 companies potentially adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Globally, reactions to the prospect of US Bitcoin adoption have varied. Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is still uncertain about the movements of countries like the US and others toward adopting Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao predicted that smaller nations will likely lead the charge in adopting Bitcoin reserves, although he still acknowledged that the shift could take time. Zhao also suggested that China could emerge as one of the key players when it comes to adopting a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Saylor Teases New Bitcoin Move While the US government may be a bit hesitant to add to its Bitcoin stockpile, the same can not be said for Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy. Saylor shared a Bitcoin chart from the SaylorTracker website on Dec. 29, continuing his Sunday tradition of hinting at even more potential Bitcoin purchases. Posts like these from Saylor very often precede a Monday acquisition by MicroStrategy. The company's most recent purchase on Dec. 22 involved 5,200 BTC at an average price of $106,000 per coin. This was its smallest acquisition since July of 2024. Saylor is a steadfast Bitcoin advocate, and has consistently openly voiced his commitment to purchasing Bitcoin regardless of its price. In December, MicroStrategy called a special shareholders meeting to secure additional funding for Bitcoin purchases under its ambitious 21/21 plan. This initiative aims to raise $42 billion over three years, split evenly between equity offerings and fixed-income corporate securities, to boost the company’s Bitcoin holdings. Beyond corporate strategy, Saylor also proposed a comprehensive framework for digital assets in the United States. His plan includes establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve capable of offsetting the US national debt by creating $16 trillion to $81 trillion in asset wealth. He believes that growing the digital asset market to a $10 trillion valuation could reinforce the US dollar’s position as the global reserve currency, driving demand for US government securities and overcollateralized stablecoins like Tether’s USDt. Saylor’s framework also categorizes digital assets into six types: digital commodities, digital securities, digital currencies, digital tokens, non-fungible tokens, and digital ABTs tied to real-world commodities. Pro-Crypto Policies Face Two-Year Deadline David Sacks, who was recently appointed as the ”AI and crypto czar,” has a very narrow two-year window to drive pro-crypto policies in the United States before the 2026 midterm elections. Joe Doll, general counsel for NFT marketplace Magic Eden, recently pointed out the urgency of the situation in an interview , and warned that a divided government after the midterms could lead to gridlock. This makes it essential to act while both chambers of Congress remain under the current administration's control. Doll also shared that with the slim House majority likely to flip, policymakers have only 24 months to enact major changes. Party breakdown (Source: US House Press Gallery ) The crypto community welcomed the incoming administration's pro-innovation stance. David Sacks is a long-time supporter of cryptocurrencies and technological innovation, and was celebrated for his new role. On Dec. 4, President-elect Trump also nominated Paul Atkins as chairman of the SEC. This was followed by the selection of Stephen Miran as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors. He was praised for his pro-deregulation stance and encouragement of technological progress. Rep. French Hill of Arkansas further reinforced the administration's priorities by pointing out the GOP’s focus on introducing a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. He revealed that crafting a digital asset market structure bill is a top priority for Republican leadership, and there are already plans to advance the legislation within the first 100 days of the new legislative session. New IRS Rule Threatens DeFi Innovation Although the Trump administration seems hard at work creating a pro-crypto environment, a new IRS rule may dampen the excitement quite a bit. The crypto industry is grappling with a new Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reporting rule that classifies decentralized finance (DeFi) front-ends as brokerages. The rule was issued on Dec. 27, 2024, and attracted widespread criticism and immediate legal challenges. If implemented, the regulation will require DeFi front-ends and decentralized exchanges to comply with broker reporting requirements by 2027. Alex Thorn outlined three potential paths for DeFi applications in response to the rule. They can choose to comply with the IRS requirements and accept their classification as brokerages, block US users entirely, or opt to become highly decentralized by abandoning smart contract upgrades and revenue generation. Thorn did mention that extremely decentralized applications that lack front-end websites, cannot be upgraded, and do not collect fees may be exempt from the rule. The rule sparked serious opposition in the crypto industry, and many advocacy groups and executives categorized it as government overreach. Consensys attorney Bill Hughes also criticized the timing of the rule’s release, and suggested it was intentionally issued during the holiday season to minimize scrutiny. In response, organizations including the Texas Blockchain Council, the Blockchain Association, and the DeFi Education Fund filed a joint lawsuit against the IRS on the same day that the rule was announced. The lawsuit argues that the rule represents unconstitutional overreach by the Department of the Treasury and the IRS. Crypto executives also called on Congress to intervene and block the regulation by warning that it could stifle innovation and drive DeFi development away from the United States.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6738/galaxy-digital-predicts-us-will-not-buy-bitcoin-in-2025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

For instance, the company bought 5,262 BTC for a total of $561 million in the week ending Dec. 22. Saylor teased the purchase in a Sunday post on X. The history of buying Bitcoins on Mondays has caught the market’s attention. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin chart prompted a deluge of replies from market participants, as this could be MicroStrategy’s last purchase of 2024. Additionally, many players see the company as a pivotal player in the crypto market, given its strategic Bitcoin acquisitions in the past. MicroStrategy’s Proposal to Buy More BTC, Journey to the Nasdaq 100 The largest corporate holder of Bitcoin recently sought shareholder approval to increase its shares in order to enhance its ability to buy more Bitcoins. MicroStrategy filed a proxy statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise its Class A common shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion and its preferred shares from 5 million to 1.005 billion. Further, MicroStrategy has joined the Nasdaq 100 index, marking a significant milestone for the company and the broader cryptocurrency market. Analysts from Cryptorush, an online crypto gaming company, shared insights on MicroStrategy’s listing on Nasdaq. In an email to Cryptonews, the experts noted that the news ignites the potential ripple effects on Bitcoin prices and the overall crypto ecosystem. “MicroStrategy’s success is a testament to the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin,” a leading crypto analyst from Cryptorush told Cryptonews. “Its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 could act as a bullish signal for the market.” The analysts noted that following the company’s listing on the Nasdaq, there would be passive fund inflows estimated at up to $2 billion. Additionally, there would be a boost in stock value and increased institutional visibility. “MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the NASDAQ 100 is not just a win for the company but a potential game-changer for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry at large.” The post Michael Saylor Likely to Purchase More Bitcoin Before 2024 Ends, Teases a BTC Chart appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/microstrategy-head-teases-bitcoin-chart-likely-to-buy-more-btc/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38299139.jpeg

Besides, the volume of the token has been slashed heavily, due to which cryptos like Avalanche have become less volatile. In times when more squeeze is expected, the AVAX price is expected to trigger a strong breakout that could elevate the levels beyond the current consolidation. Avalanche is among the tokens, which are believed to outperform the top 2 tokens in the upcoming price action as they are considered to be heavily undervalued at the current price. Mainly because no major change in the price was recorded even after the launch of Avalanche 9000, which is considered the largest-ever upgrade of the platform. However, the price was heading towards the yearly highs ahead of the launch but the token followed the market trend and plunged by over 30%. The token’s inefficiency to rise above $40 over the past week could have raised some concerns over the next price action. However, in the wider perspective, the AVAX price remains primed for a 50% upswing, but if the bulls manage to revive a 12% rise before the end of 2024,. The daily chart of the AVAX price may suggest the token could be heading towards the immediate lower support as it is on the verge of losing the 0.5 FIB at $36.26. The MACD indicates a drop in the selling pressure but it is yet to be flipped to a buying range. On the other hand, the bears continue to hold a major dominance as seen in the bull-bear power, indicating another pullback of around 10% could be in place, probably reaching the interim support at 0.382 FIB at $32.2. These levels have been offering strong support previously and hence a strong rebound could be expected at these levels. However, the market sentiments have not yet turned bullish as the traders continue to remain neutral. Therefore, the Avalanche price is expected to maintain a sluggish trend until the platform receives enough volume favouring the bulls. AVAX is usually referred to as the sleeping giant, as it is believed to have huge potential and is defending the support to a large extent. However, the market volatility has slashed hard and until the BTC dominance reaches highs, altcoins like Avalanche are expected to maintain a sluggish trend. However, the AVAX price still has the potential to rise above $50 and head towards a higher target, but rising and sustaining above $42 by the end of the year in the first few days if 2025 is very important.",NEUTRAL,AVAX | BTC,ALTCOIN | AVAX | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/avalanche-flashing-major-bullish-signals-here-are-the-upper-targets-for-avax-price-rally-for-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

With over $200,000 raised in its presale and RACE tokens at $0.00825, the platform shows how gaming can combine entertainment with real value. The numbers speak clearly: over 14 million RACE tokens staked and rewards approaching 3,000% reveal how blockchain technology transforms traditional gaming into an experience where players truly own and grow their gaming assets. From Traditional Gaming to Blockchain: A New Way to Play Think of traditional gaming like a closed theme park – you buy tickets to enjoy the rides, but those tickets have no value outside the park. Race To A Billion changes this model by making your gaming tokens valuable assets that grow with the platform’s success. When you hold RACE tokens at today’s price of $0.00825, you’re not just buying entry tickets – you’re becoming part of the gaming ecosystem. Blockchain technology changes how we think about in-game value. Every RACE token you own is recorded on an unalterable digital ledger. Your predictions, rewards, and tokens are protected by smart contracts – automated systems that enforce fair play without human intervention. This creates transparency that traditional gaming can’t match: you can see exactly how many tokens exist, how many are staked, and watch the reward system work in real time. Understanding Token Value and Growth The value system of Race To A Billion starts with its carefully planned token supply of 2.5 billion RACE . Like a well-designed economy, each token serves specific purposes within the platform. Currently, millions of RACE tokens are staked by early supporters, showing strong belief in the platform’s future. These staked tokens earn decent rewards, creating a steady flow of benefits for participants. The current price per token reflects the project’s early stage, similar to getting in on the ground floor of a growing business. The staking program rewards this early support generously – when you stake your tokens, you’re not just holding them, but actively participating in the platform’s growth. The distribution system releases rewards steadily through blockchain mechanics, ensuring a fair and transparent process for all participants. The Path from Presale to Gaming Platform Race To A Billion follows a carefully structured path from presale to full gaming platform. The current presale stage has already raised over $200,000, showing how blockchain gaming attracts both players and investors. At the current price per RACE token, early supporters can join before gaming features go live, much like getting exclusive access to a game before its official launch. The development journey happens in clear phases. Right now, we’re in the foundation-building stage where early supporters can stake their tokens and earn rewards. The next phase brings the actual gaming platform to life, where predictions turn tokens into active gaming tools. This step-by-step approach ensures each part of the platform works perfectly before moving forward, creating a stable environment for both gaming and token value growth. Making Blockchain Gaming Work for You Participating in Race To A Billion requires understanding the different ways you can engage with the platform. Let’s explore your options and how to make the most of each one at this early stage. The entry process starts with purchasing RACE tokens, currently priced at $0.00825. The platform makes this step accessible to everyone by accepting multiple payment methods. If you’re new to blockchain, you can use your credit card through the secure Web3Payments system – it works just like any online purchase you’re familiar with. For those experienced with cryptocurrency, the platform accepts ETH, USDT, and BNB, allowing you to connect your crypto wallet and make a direct purchase. After acquiring tokens, you face an important decision. The staking program , which has attracted over 14 million RACE tokens, offers substantial rewards. Think of staking as putting your tokens to work – they generate passive earnings while supporting the platform’s growth. The rewards get distributed automatically through smart contracts, ensuring fair and transparent payment to all participants. Your strategy might depend on your gaming and investment goals. Long-term participants often choose staking for steady rewards, while those excited about prediction gaming might hold tokens for immediate use when features launch. The current presale price of $0.00825 offers both options – you can stake for rewards now and still have tokens ready for gaming later. Remember, starting small lets you learn the system while participating in the platform’s early growth.

However, the offering faces a unique hurdle, as no Solana futures products are currently available on any Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-regulated exchange. According to the fund’s prospectus, the proposed ETFs would invest only in futures contracts traded on CFTC-registered exchanges. This is questionable since Solana futures contracts do not yet exist and there is no approved spot Solana ETF. “This is crazy,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Balchunas added that the filing could signal that Solana futures could soon become a reality, which “probably bodes well” for future approval of spot ETFs. Offering a broader regulatory perspective, Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, suggested that the filing could reflect a shift in the ongoing power struggle between the SEC and CFTC over digital asset oversight. “The CFTC may be winning its power struggle with the SEC over digital asset regulation,” Geraci commented. Related News: Whales Clash Over This Altcoin - Two Buy Huge Wallets, One Sells Big The move also reignites speculation about which digital asset could be next in line to receive ETF approval, with some experts believing Solana could lead the way, while others have expressed optimism that XRP or other cryptocurrencies could be considered.

Standing out in this dynamic arena is Web3Bay ($3BAY), a decentralized e-commerce platform set to reshape how businesses and consumers connect online. With its forward-thinking approach, Web3Bay is quickly gaining traction as a top choice among the top trending crypto presales for investors in 2025. With projections showing the global e-commerce market reaching a staggering $8.1 trillion by 2026, blockchain technology is poised to revolutionize the sector by facilitating seamless, borderless transactions, slashing costs, and heightening transparency. Web3Bay is perfectly positioned to harness this wave, offering early investors a shot at being part of a transformative movement. Yet, Web3Bay isn’t the only game in town. Joining it in the spotlight are other promising presales like Crypto All-Stars, Pandana and Metacade each catching the eyes of discerning investors. This article will delve into the unique aspects of Web3Bay and discuss why it might be the golden ticket for crypto enthusiasts in 2025. Top Trending Crypto Presales of 2025 The year 2025 is set to unveil exceptional investment opportunities with several groundbreaking projects entering the market. Leading the pack are Web3Bay, Crypto All-Stars, Pandana and Metacade, each presenting unique features and pioneering approaches that nominate them as prime contenders for those seeking the top trending crypto presales. Web3Bay: Pioneering Global Commerce Web3Bay is reimagining the e-commerce sphere by seamlessly blending blockchain technology with traditional payment systems. This platform breaks away from the norms of high fees and centralized oversight typical of traditional marketplaces, offering a decentralized, borderless ecosystem where merchants and consumers can directly and securely connect. The platform’s dual payment model stands as a beacon of innovation. Transactions can utilize Web3Bay’s native token, $3BAY, or opt for conventional methods like PayPal. This inclusivity welcomes both blockchain aficionados and newcomers alike, ensuring everyone can partake in this modern marketplace. One of the most compelling attributes of Web3Bay is its structured presale. Tokens start at just $0.003, with a 15% price increase planned across 28 stages, setting the stage for potential returns exceeding 6430% by full launch— a prospect that’s hard to overlook. Key Features of Web3Bay: Decentralized Marketplace: A transparent, user-centric platform where individuals maintain control over their data and assets. Reduced Transaction Fees: Integrating blockchain technology, Web3Bay lowers fees, democratizing e-commerce for both merchants and consumers. Robust Security: Leveraging smart contracts and decentralized storage to facilitate secure, trust-free transactions. Community Governance: Looking ahead, the platform aims to evolve into a DAO, empowering users to directly influence its future. Web3Bay’s ambition to forge a boundless digital marketplace has solidified its position as one of the top trending crypto presales to buy in 2025. Other Notable Presales for 2025 Crypto All-Stars (STARS): A novel initiative designed to transform the meme coin ecosystem, featuring MemeVault for staking popular tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The STARS token enhances staking rewards, drawing robust community backing with over $9 million raised in its presale. Pandana (PNDN): A DeFi platform making waves by simplifying access to financial services such as staking, yield farming, and liquidity provisions, bridging conventional finance with the DeFi sector. Metacade (MCADE): A trailblazing Web3 gaming platform that lets users create, share, and monetize games within a vibrant community-driven ecosystem. Why Web3Bay Stands Out While each project presents unique merits, Web3Bay’s dedication to solving real-world e-commerce challenges distinguishes it from the crowd. Its blend of blockchain innovation with familiar payment systems invites widespread participation, and its user-driven governance model promises a community-shaped future. The enticing presale structure of Web3Bay opens a window for early investors to secure substantial returns, making it an attractive option for both newcomers and veteran crypto investors alike. Top Trending Crypto Presales for 2025 As we move closer to 2025, presales like Web3Bay, Crypto All-Stars, Pandana, and Metacade are stirring significant interest with their innovative approaches and transformative potential. These projects are at the forefront of the next wave of blockchain innovation, offering early backers a prime opportunity to capitalize on exponential growth. Among them, Web3Bay stands as a pillar in decentralized e-commerce, tackling real-world issues with its innovative payment integration, reduced costs, and inclusive governance. With its presale gaining momentum, Web3Bay is shaping up to be a key to substantial gains in the near future. For those seeking the top trending crypto presales of 2025, Web3Bay is a must-consider.

38295588,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53422,1735538218,48 Hours Remaining for XRP Yearly Candle Before a Rocket Rally to $15,"EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a widely followed cryptocurrency analyst, has highlighted a key moment for XRP as 2024 comes to an end. According to a chart shared on X, XRP’s yearly price action shows the asset is on the verge of breaking a major resistance level at $2. With just over two days remaining in the year, EGRAG CRYPTO emphasized the importance of this milestone and the potential implications for the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. #XRP – This Yearly Candle: 48 hours remaining for the Yearly Candle: #XRPFamily STAY STEADY AND STRONG. pic.twitter.com/qNGhMmqbqG — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 29, 2024 Historical Context and Current Outlook The chart depicts XRP’s yearly candles since its inception, categorized into different areas based on price levels. XRP initially traded in “Area A,” ranging between$0.006 and $0.03. Following its remarkable rally in 2017, XRP surged to its all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. This breakout moved the asset into “Area B,” with a support range near $0.35. Since then, XRP has largely remained in this zone, despite occasional price fluctuations. For the first time in its history, XRP is closing the year above the $2 mark. The asset broke above $2 in early December, less than two weeks after SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation in January 2025. At the time of his analysis, the asset traded at $2.1431 and has maintained the $2.14 level. The $2 level is crucial, as breaking above it would mark a significant bullish signal and open the path toward higher targets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Future Price Targets EGRAG CRYPTO has outlined $15 as the potential target for XRP. The $15 level, referred to as “Valhalla” on the chart, is the next major support zone if XRP breaks into the next phase of its price journey. This target represents a significant increase from current levels and could serve as a foundation for further gains. Notably, $15 is the support zone for the next phase, meaning the digital asset could climb much higher than this target. EGRAG CRYPTO has previously predicted that XRP can reach $27 , and the chart shows that the next zone surpasses $140. This suggests that the digital asset could easily reach the $27 level. The possibility of XRP closing above $2 has captured the attention of investors and traders. With just two days left in 2024, XRP stands at a pivotal junction. Breaking above $2 would mark a significant milestone in its yearly performance and pave the way for future growth.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/new-solana-memecoin-musk-ai-king-muskai-will-skyrocket-16000-before-exchange-listings/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

38299138,https://cryptonews.com/?p=323270,1735537909,Long-Term Ether Holders Increase to 75% by End of 2024 while Bitcoin Holders Drop,"The proportion of long-term Ether (ETH) holders surged throughout 2024, reflecting growing confidence in the cryptocurrency, while Bitcoin (BTC) saw a decline in its long-term holder base. Data from blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock revealed that the percentage of long-term Ether holders climbed from 59% in January to 75% by the end of the year. In contrast, Bitcoin’s long-term holder percentage dropped from 70% to 62% over the same period. Over 70% of Ether Holders Are Long-Term Holders Long-term holders, defined as those who retain an asset for more than a year, offer insights into investor sentiment and confidence. IntoTheBlock reported that, as of Dec. 30, 75.06% of Ether holders were categorized as long-term, compared to 62.31% for Bitcoin holders. The shift suggests a growing preference among investors to hold ETH for the long haul, driven by optimism about its future prospects heading into 2025. While ETH gained traction among holders, Bitcoin faced a different trend. Technical analyst Ger Van Lagen noted that Bitcoin’s price saw significant volatility in December, dropping from an all-time high of $106,000 to $93,000. Van Lagen attributed this correction to long-term Bitcoin holders cashing out during a euphoric market phase. Despite this, he maintained a bullish outlook for BTC, predicting it could surpass $200,000 in the near future. This chart shows the percentage of long-term Bitcoin and Ether holders over the past year. While the share of long-term Bitcoin decreased, the percentage of long-term ETH holders climbed, surpassing that of Bitcoin early in the year. pic.twitter.com/F7ghaSq66T — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 29, 2024 Ether’s growing appeal was further bolstered by strong inflows into spot Ether ETFs, which doubled in December, reaching $2.1 billion. This momentum underscores the increasing institutional and retail interest in ETH, supported by developments like the inclusion of staking in Ether ETFs and the prospect of enhanced regulatory clarity from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). As Ethereum continues to innovate and gain traction, industry experts remain optimistic about its performance in 2025. Factors such as increased staking opportunities, improved regulatory oversight, and a shift away from “financial nihilism” position ETH as a key player in the evolving cryptocurrency market. Top 104 Ethereum Whales Now Control 57% of All ETH Earlier this month, it was revealed that Ethereum’s largest whale wallets now hold 57% of the total Ether supply, marking an all-time high for whale dominance. The top 104 whale wallets, each holding over 100,000 ETH, collectively control around $333 billion worth of Ether. The accumulation trend among these large holders suggests growing confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. While the share of ETH controlled by whales has risen, mid-sized holders (wallets with 10 to 100,000 ETH) have seen their portion drop to a record low of 33.5%. Smaller wallets holding less than 100 ETH now account for just 9.19% of the total supply, marking a near four-year low. Last month, Ethereum reclaimed its position as the leading blockchain for Tether (USDT), surpassing Tron with a supply of $60.3 billion. It marked Ethereum’s return to dominance for the first time since August 2022. Tether maintains its position as the largest stablecoin globally, with a market capitalization of $132.3 billion.

Here’s Why It Is Expected To Outperform XRP In 2025,"Rollblock (RBLK) is among the most talked about altcoins in cryptocurrency with its approach to decentralized gaming and the expanding GameFi market. With substantial presale success and a unique value proposition, Rollblock is setting the stage for massive growth. Experts predict that RBLK has the potential to hit $1 much faster than anticipated, even outperforming well-established coins like XRP in 2025. The platform’s innovative tokenomics, high staking rewards, and expanding ecosystem make Rollblock a strong contender for impressive returns. Here’s why RBLK could be one of the best crypto investments for the coming years. Why Rollblock Could Outperform XRP in 2025? Rollblock (RBLK) is a web-based gambling platform on the Ethereum blockchain that promises to change the GameFi business. It incorporates an exciting casino with blockchain-powered transparency and security. Unlike traditional gambling platforms, which suffer from third-party manipulation, Rollblock offers a decentralized, Ethereum-backed security system. All bets are tamper-proof and encrypted on-chain, safeguarding users’ sensitive data from hackers. Rollblock’s smart contract has passed a SolidProof audit, and the platform holds an iGaming license from Gaming Anjouan, cementing its legitimacy and credibility on the market. Additionally, Rollblock provides complete transparency, allowing players to view betting analytics and enhance their performance. Investors have been drawn to Rollblock because of its innovative approach to the $450 billion annual gambling market. RBLK holders will get up to 30% of weekly profits to purchase back RBLK tokens from the open market. This buyback mechanism will help increase the token’s price. Additionally, 60% of the repurchased RBLK will be burned, creating scarcity. The remaining 40% is allocated as staking rewards to stakers on the platform, offering some of the highest annual percentage yields (APYs) in the space. With more than 7,000 AI-powered casino games available, Rollblock provides a secure and profitable platform for players and investors. Why Rollblock’s $7.74 Million Presale Success is Only the Beginning Rollblock (RBLK) has achieved groundbreaking success during its presale, raising over $7.74 million in record time. More than 35,000 early investors are already backing Rollblock’s GameFi project, confident it will dominate the market in 2025. Rollblock’s unique approach of integrating blockchain technology into iGaming has analysts predicting a massive 100x rally for $RBLK on launch day. For a limited time, $RBLK tokens are available at just $0.044 in stage 9 of the presale. Since its ICO debut, RBLK has surged by 330% , with analysts expecting an additional 550% increase. Once the token officially launches, a jaw-dropping 50x explosion is predicted. Rollblock’s buy-back program and revenue-sharing model have significantly boosted its appeal, attracting a growing number of investors. The presale continues to raise millions, with rumors of an upcoming major exchange listing further enhancing Rollblock’s standing as one of the leading platforms in the crypto gaming space.

Despite an uptick in trading volume, the overall market sentiment remains cautious, with uncertainties surrounding regulatory developments and market dynamics. Notably, FTX Token (FTT) bucked the trend, surging on news of claims processing beginning early next year, while altcoins like XRP and Solana extended their losses. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin was trading at $93,084 at the time of writing, reflecting a 2.04% decline in the past 24 hours. The flagship cryptocurrency recorded a low of $93,079 and a high of $95,341 during the day. Trading volume surged 40% to $32 billion, signaling heightened activity despite the downturn. Analysts attributed the dip to broader market pressures and speculations about a potential sell-off. Meanwhile, BTC ETFs saw weekly inflows of $387 million, indicating sustained institutional interest. Ethereum shows resilience Ethereum (ETH) emerged as the only major cryptocurrency in the green, posting a 1% gain to trade at $3,421. The 24-hour low and high for ETH were $3,327 and $3,434, respectively. However, market experts warned of potential sell pressure after 110K ETH flowed into exchanges. Weekly inflows into ETH ETFs stood at $349 million, reflecting investor confidence in the asset. Altcoins under pressure XRP prices dropped by 3%, trading at $2.12 with a low of $2.076 and a high of $2.197. The bearish trend mirrors the broader altcoin market. Solana (SOL) fell 1% to $192, with a daily low of $188.73 and a high of $197.59. Despite the slight dip, Solana remains one of the most actively traded altcoins. FTX Token (FTT) surged by 10%, trading at $3.75 after the announcement that claims processing would begin on January 3, 2025. The token recorded a 24-hour low of $3.416 and a high of $3.826, reflecting strong buying interest. Ethena (ENA) also gained 6%, trading at $1, with trading volume spiking by 45% to $352 million. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitget Token (BGB) dropped 20% to $6.01, recording high volatility with a peak of $7.85. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) declined by 10% to $0.032 despite its impressive 500% monthly gain. Other cryptocurrencies, including Movement (MOVE), OKB, and Beam (BEAM), experienced moderate losses of around 5%. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization dipped 1.5% over the last 24 hours, standing at $3.29 trillion. However, trading volume saw a 12% increase to $90 billion, indicating active participation despite the bearish sentiment. As the market grapples with price volatility and regulatory uncertainties, the focus remains on Bitcoin’s performance and the evolving altcoin landscape.

According to a recent analysis by CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) on X, XRP is poised to exit a falling wedge pattern on December 29, 2024. The chart that the analyst presented suggests a rapid rise to $5.6 by January 19, 2025, echoing its price movement in March 2017. If we follow the March 2017 pattern #XRP will break out of this falling wedge tomorrow and reach $5.60 on January 19. pic.twitter.com/tcX0nUNBII — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 28, 2024 XRP trades above $2 for the first time since 2018, reflecting renewed investor interest. Additionally, XRP recently touched $2.86, its highest price since 2018, suggesting robust buying pressure. While the digital asset has faced significant resistance, its ability to hold above $2 shows its underlying strength. If the bullish momentum continues, the chance of a new all-time high cannot be ruled out. CryptoBull’s chart analysis highlights a falling wedge, a bullish continuation pattern indicating a possible upward breakout. The daily chart shows XRP consolidating within this wedge, with decreasing price volatility and narrowing trendlines. The analyst recently shared a similar analysis , and this breakout, anticipated to occur soon, aligns with historical patterns that suggest significant upward momentum following such formations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can XRP Mirror Its 2017 Performance? The importance of this potential breakout lies in the projected trajectory. If CryptoBull’s analysis holds, XRP’s move to $5.60 would represent a substantial gain of 154.5% from its current price of $2.2. Such growth would send the asset to a new all-time high, eclipsing its current peak of $3.84 which it achieved in January 2018. However, it is important to note, that while chart patterns like the falling wedge are reliable indicators, they are not guarantees. Market sentiment, external news, and broader economic factors all play a role in determining price movements. However, investors seem to be overwhelmingly bullish on XRP. The broader macroeconomic and regulatory landscape contributes to the positive sentiment around the digital asset. The recent resignation announcement by Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair, effective January 20, 2025, is a pivotal development for crypto. President-elect Donald Trump has already nominated a pro-crypto successor to Gensler, and January 20 will be a pivotal day for XRP. Notably, CryptoBull expects XRP to hit $5.6 by January 19. Trump’s inauguration and Gensler’s resignation the following day could give XRP a much larger boost, potentially sending it to double or triple digits.

38293907,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53412,1735536624,Sui TVL Crosses $2 Billion. Rollblock May Top That Post Presale,"SUI ’s TVL recently surpassed $2 billion after a 16% growth in the last 30 days. This milestone puts the blockchain in the spotlight for its growing market cap and user activity. Meanwhile, Rollblock is on the verge of its post-presale launch, with some speculating it could challenge SUI ’s figures. With Rollblock pioneering multiple web3 innovations, investors are closely watching its potential to outperform established cryptos. Unlock Gaming Rewards With Rollblock At The Helm The online gambling industry has evolved, integrating blockchain technology to address traditional challenges. Rollblock operates in this space, using RBLK as its native token. This token fuels transactions and connects the gaming platform to decentralized finance models, creating a seamless user experience. Currently, Rollblock features over 7000 games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, poker, and live casino options. It also offers sports betting on football, basketball, tennis, and more. The iGaming platform plans to add 100 more games by year end to expand its selection further. Rollblock is clearly taking committed steps to provide a diverse and engaging gaming experience for its users. Players will be able to secure income from Rollblock ’s lineup by holding or staking RBLK tokens. Staking offers direct financial benefits, as a share of the platform’s weekly revenue is distributed to participants. This revenue-sharing model ensures active players and investors can benefit from Rollblock ‘s growth. However, rewards are proportional to the amount staked. Deflationary measures play a key role in Rollblock ‘s tokenomics. Periodic token buybacks and burns reduce the circulating supply of RBLK. This strategy increases scarcity, helping stabilize and potentially boost the token’s market value. Additionally, cashback incentives and bonus programs encourage continuous participation while supporting the health of Rollblock ‘s ecosystem. SUI Performance Opposes General Market Trend Despite the bearish appearance of the crypto market, SUI demonstrated growth, with its TVL crossing $2 billion—a 16% increase over the past 30 days. The surge in TVL speaks to the growing confidence in SUI ‘s ecosystem. It’s metrics like these that have led SUI to a 25% price increase in the past month, with over $12 billion in market cap . SUI ’s early partnerships with Franklin Templeton Digital Assets and Google Cloud enhance its technological capabilities and market reach. From a technical perspective, SUI has been consolidating below a descending resistance line after reaching an all-time high of $4.93. Its RSI suggests the potential for a bullish reversal if it breaks above this resistance. Analysts predict that SUI could reach approximately $14.94 by early January, representing a potential 227% price increase. This optimistic outlook is based on SUI ‘s recent performance and strategic developments. On CoinMarketCap, community sentiments are largely positive, as 85% of SUI enthusiasts vote bullish. Conclusion Over the past month, both SUI and RBLK have outperformed the market average. However, unlike SUI, Rollblock is not constrained by a growth cap. Currently in its ninth stage of presale, RBLK tokens are priced at $0.044 each. Investors in the presale can benefit from daily, weekly, and monthly rakebacks from casino games, along with tiered bonuses based on their RBLK holdings.

38293825,https://coinpaper.com/6737/bitcoin-atm-network-in-australia-nears-european-totals,1735536600,Bitcoin ATM Network in Australia Nears European Totals,"While MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor continues to push boundaries with bold acquisition plans and proposals for integrating Bitcoin into the US economy, Australia is nearing Europe in the number of Bitcoin ATMs, reflecting the increasing accessibility of digital currencies worldwide. Australia’s Bitcoin ATM Boom: Nearing European Totals in Global Crypto Expansion Australia’s Bitcoin automated teller machine (ATM) network has been growing at an impressive pace, positioning the country as a global leader in cryptocurrency accessibility. Over the past 29 months, the number of Bitcoin ATMs in Australia has consistently increased, bringing the total to 1,359 as of December 2024. According to data from Coin ATM Radar , this accounts for 3.5% of all Bitcoin ATMs globally, cementing Australia's position as the third-largest Bitcoin ATM network in the world. This consistent growth brings Australia close to surpassing Europe in the number of Bitcoin ATMs, with Europe hosting 1,660 machines. Should the trend continue, Australia is on track to solidify itself as a global hotspot for cryptocurrency adoption, trailing only the United States and Canada. Australia’s net positive addition of Bitcoin ATMs over the last 29 months is indicative of the country’s commitment to advancing cryptocurrency adoption. The steady increase suggests growing public interest in digital currencies and a supportive ecosystem for crypto transactions. Despite Australia’s achievements, North America remains the uncontested leader in Bitcoin ATM installations. The United States is home to an astonishing 31,516 Bitcoin ATMs, representing a staggering 81.3% of the global total. Canada follows with 3,027 machines, contributing an additional 7.8%. Together, these two countries account for over 90% of all Bitcoin ATMs worldwide. In comparison, Europe and Oceania each contribute approximately 4% to the global Bitcoin ATM network. Asia, despite its vast population and growing interest in digital currencies, lags significantly, with only 0.9% of Bitcoin ATMs globally. As of December 2024, there are 38,753 Bitcoin ATMs operational worldwide. The continued expansion of these machines comes amid the growing demand for convenient cryptocurrency transactions. Bitcoin ATMs play a crucial role in enhancing accessibility, allowing users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with ease. The Rising Threat of Bitcoin ATM Scams While Bitcoin ATMs symbolize progress in cryptocurrency adoption, they also bring challenges, particularly in combating fraud. In 2023, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported a surge in scams involving Bitcoin ATMs, with fraudsters exploiting the anonymity and speed of crypto transactions to target unsuspecting victims. Losses from these scams exceeded $110 million, highlighting the need for enhanced security measures. To address these concerns, lawmakers in the US have urged major Bitcoin ATM operators to implement stricter anti-fraud measures. A particular focus has been placed on protecting vulnerable demographics, such as the elderly, who are often targeted by scammers. Australia’s Bitcoin ATM growth signals the country’s rising prominence in the global cryptocurrency market. With continued expansion, Australia is poised to strengthen its position as a leader in crypto accessibility, potentially surpassing Europe in the near future. As the global crypto ecosystem evolves, challenges such as fraud must be addressed to ensure that Bitcoin ATMs remain a trusted and secure gateway for cryptocurrency adoption. For now, Australia’s steady progress signals a bright future for digital currency infrastructure in the region. The rise of Bitcoin ATMs in Australia suggests there is a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a mainstream financial instrument. As Australia approaches Europe in the number of Bitcoin ATMs, it showcases the country's dedication to building a robust crypto ecosystem. However, as this expansion continues, addressing the accompanying risks, such as fraud, will be critical to sustaining the momentum and trust in the industry. MicroStrategy’s Strategy and Vision for Digital Asset Growth In other Bitcoin news, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, a prominent BTC advocate, has once again stirred speculation within the cryptocurrency market. On Dec. 29, 2024, Saylor posted the Bitcoin chart from SaylorTracker.com on X, captioned with a cryptic message: “Disconcerting blue lines on SaylorTracker.com.” His posts have become a Sunday ritual that often precedes MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases on Monday, creating anticipation among market participants. MicroStrategy completed its latest Bitcoin acquisition on Dec. 22, 2024, buying 5,200 BTC at an average price of $106,000 per coin. This purchase, while significant, marked the company’s smallest acquisition since July 2024. Despite the lower volume, the move reaffirmed MicroStrategy’s mission to accumulate Bitcoin regardless of market conditions—a strategy Saylor has vocalized in the past. Saylor’s unwavering confidence in the leading crypto has positioned MicroStrategy as a leveraged bet on BTC. The company’s market performance is now closely tied to Bitcoin’s price movements, with traders viewing MicroStrategy as a proxy for Bitcoin’s health and trajectory. In December 2024, MicroStrategy called for a special shareholders meeting to discuss its ambitious 21/21 Plan, which aims to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions. The plan outlines raising $42 billion over the next three years through a combination of equity offerings and fixed-income corporate securities—$21 billion from each avenue. This aggressive strategy is part of Saylor’s long-term vision of making Bitcoin a cornerstone asset for the company. The funds raised will bolster MicroStrategy’s holdings, further solidifying its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Beyond his corporate endeavors, Saylor has also proposed a comprehensive framework for digital assets in the United States. His ambitious plan includes the establishment of a Bitcoin strategic reserve that could offset the US national debt by providing the Treasury with $16 trillion to $81 trillion in asset wealth. The proposal is centered on growing the digital asset market capitalization to $10 trillion, which Saylor argues would enhance the demand for the US dollar and government securities. This, in turn, could cement the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency in an increasingly digital economy. A Taxonomy for Digital Assets As part of his framework, Saylor has outlined a detailed taxonomy for digital assets, categorizing them into six distinct classes: Digital Commodities – Assets like Bitcoin that function as a store of value. Digital Securities – Blockchain-based representations of traditional securities. Digital Currencies – Cryptocurrencies designed for transactions. Digital Tokens – Utility tokens with specific functionalities in ecosystems. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) – Unique assets representing ownership or rights. Digital ABTs This classification aims to provide clarity and structure to the digital asset market, fostering a regulatory environment conducive to growth and innovation. Saylor’s vision extends beyond MicroStrategy’s balance sheet, aiming to redefine the role of digital assets in the global financial system. His proposals for integrating Bitcoin into the US economic framework shed light on the growing influence of digital currencies on macroeconomic policy. While MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions have drawn both praise and skepticism, the company’s strategy has undeniably shaped perceptions of corporate crypto adoption. As Saylor continues to champion Bitcoin as the premier digital commodity, MicroStrategy’s moves remain a barometer for institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space. Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy have become synonymous with Bitcoin’s corporate adoption, pushing the boundaries of how traditional businesses engage with digital assets. From bold acquisition strategies to visionary frameworks for national economic integration, Saylor’s leadership reflects a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s transformative potential. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, MicroStrategy’s actions and Saylor’s proposals will likely serve as a litmus test for the scalability and legitimacy of Bitcoin in the global economy. Whether through strategic acquisitions or ambitious policy frameworks, Saylor’s enduring belief in Bitcoin continues to shape the narrative of cryptocurrency adoption worldwide.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6737/bitcoin-atm-network-in-australia-nears-european-totals,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

But savvy investors? They’re rubbing their hands in excitement. Why? Because downturns are the golden opportunities to snag investments that can skyrocket. The meme coin market, long considered a playground for laughs, has evolved into a lucrative investment hub. Recent developments have shown just how powerful these coins can be, with communities rallying behind their favourites and massive returns becoming a real possibility for early adopters. One coin turning heads is BTFD Coin ($BTFD). At just $0.000142 per coin and over $4.6 million already raised and more than 7,000 holders backing it, $BTFD is cementing its position as the frontrunner in meme coins this year. But it’s not alone—other contenders like Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT), Neiro ($NEIRO), and Book of Meme ($BOME) are also making waves. Let’s dive in and explore why these coins are the best new meme coins with 100x potential. 1.

38293537,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634627,1735535698,US Dollar surges backed by US treasury yields,"Rising US treasury yields boosted the dollar, while the Japanese yen hit five-month lows on Monday. However, most currencies were steady due to low year-end liquidity. According to a recent report by Reuters, the yen slid to 157.71, and speculation of Japanese intervention could prevent another test of the 160 level seen in July But the US dollar index, which tracks the currency against major rivals, was flat at 107.98. The euro stayed at $1.0429, not far from recent lows, as holiday trading dampened movements. The euro is on course to close the year around 5.5 percent lower versus the dollar. Rising U.S. Treasury yields have supported the US dollar, marking the 10-year benchmark yield to a seven-month high. On Monday, it was close at 4.625 percent. Australian broker Pepper Stone’s research head, Chris Weston, said, “Despite paid forecasters almost universally calling for a weaker U.S. dollar in 2024, the greenback looks set to close the year higher against all major currencies with the buck reigning supreme.” The US dollar index rose 2.3% this month, bringing its total year gain to 6.6%. That’s the third consecutive month of growth and comes ahead of expectations that President-elect Donald Trump’s policies, including less regulation, lower taxes, higher tariffs, and tighter immigration rules, will spur economic growth and inflation, keeping U.S. yields elevated. The US dollar has gained 10 yen since December 3, following the majority of the yen’s drop following the Federal Reserve’s cautious tone on future rate cuts on December 18. The yen has tumbled to 158.09 per dollar, less than 10.6% down from the year-to-date after dropping to its weakest since July 17.

BTC has now reversed and is trading above the $93k level. “After the post-Christmas market-wide dip, crypto markets are seeing an encouraging trend of whales moving stablecoins to exchanges,” Santiment reported. Historically, Q4 has been a strong period for Bitcoin and altcoins, which aligns with market cycles. We’re currently experiencing a cooldown, which is common after a halving event, like the one that happened in 2024. Following the halvings of previous years (2012, 2016, and 2020), Bitcoin experienced significant rallies in the subsequent year. External factors, such as global liquidity and government actions, will also influence the market. With Janet Yellen’s recent announcement that the U.S. will hit the debt ceiling in mid-January, more money printing and quantitative easing are likely. This creates favorable conditions for assets like Bitcoin. Looking ahead, January is expected to be a fairly quiet month, with the real action starting in February. Historically, March tends to be a strong month, followed by a potential consolidation in April and May due to tax season. After that, the market could pick up again in the summer, continuing into Q4. What’s Next For Bitcoin? Right now, Bitcoin is in a range, not yet fully breaking down, but it’s reacting to support and resistance levels. If Bitcoin stays below the resistance of $94,270, we could see more downside, with targets around $91,400. However, if Bitcoin breaks above the resistance at $94,270, it could signal a change in direction. But for now, the price is still showing signs of weakness, and we’re watching for any moves below support to confirm further declines.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-dropping-today/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others.

Recent data from DeFiLlama revealed that its total value locked (TVL) now stands at an all-time high of $8.217 billion, with a $1 billion spike coming within the last seven days alone. Major Players Fueling Growth Market leaders such as stablecoin issuer Usual and decentralized finance (DeFi) investment management platform Hashnote are at the forefront of this explosive growth. Numbers from DeFiLlama indicate that Hashnote saw a weekly increase of 65.58%, while Usual recorded a slightly higher growth of 65.65%. The former boasts a TVL of $1.497 billion, while the latter’s rose to $1.445 billion. Over 30 days, the metric skyrocketed 230% for Usual, while Hashnote’s kept pace at 217%. Together, the two contributed to more than 35% of the value of assets locked in the RWA sector. Usual’s strong performance comes on the back of raising $10 million in a Series A funding round led by Binance Labs and Kraken Ventures. It also recently saw the price of its governance token hit a new all-time high following claims that hackers compromised the X account of Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy and used it to publicize a fake partnership between the U.S. government and the stablecoin project. Away from the top two, green candles were also witnessed on platforms such as Nest Staking, MatrixDock, Franklin Templeton, and Ethena. Nest Staking saw a weekly increase of more than 58%, bringing its total value locked to $66.24 million. On the other hand, MatrixDock, operating on two chains, went up 48.18%, while Ethena amore modest upticks of 12.38%. Others Incur Losses Not all protocols experienced uniform growth, with DeFiLlama’s data showing that Solv Protocol, DigiFT, Danogo, KlimaDAO, and Fortunafi faced varying degrees of decline. The most significant loss across seven days was incurred by Danogo, whose $4 million TVL is over 15% lower than a week ago. Among the higher-capped projects, Solv shed the most locked value, losing more than 10% to settle at $712.81 million. However, over 30 days, Maker RWA suffered the biggest dip, with a negative change of 65%, lowering the value of assets in its custody to $290.7 million. The jump in RWA tokenization could signal a shift in how traditional assets are managed, traded, and accessed. Recently, several players in the Argentine lithium mining sector announced plans to tokenize the potentially trillion-dollar industry with the help of Cardano. Financial giants, including BlackRock, have also helped legitimize the space through its BUIDL initiative.

In his regular style, the Bitcoin ambassador always posts the same chart on Sunday before making a Bitcoin purchase on Monday. The tech entrepreneur has made a pattern on his X account where he makes a post to nearly his 4 million followers on Sundays. The post normally elicits reactions from market participants anticipating a move from MicroStrategy the following day.

MicroStrategy bought 5,200 Bitcoins at an average cost of $106,000 per coin. Though significant, this latest acquisition is MicroStrategy’s smallest since July 2024. Saylor has always said they will continue purchasing Bitcoin regardless of the price. Currently, it appears like a leveraged BTC bet that is also closely tied to the overall health of the digital asset. MicroStrategy increases efforts on Bitcoin acquisition MicroStrategy is not planning to slow down on its Bitcoin acquisition plan. The company called a strategic meeting with Shareholders in December to acquire extra resources for Bitcoin purchases as part of its 21/21 plan by increasing the number of shares to shareholders. The 21/21 strategic plan directs the firm to raise $42 billion in the next three years, $21 billion in equity offerings, and $21 billion in fixed-income corporate securities to help purchase more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy Bitcoin reserves hold a total of 444,262 BTC , with a market value of about $41.64 Billion. The company has the largest ownership of Bitcoin by a single entity. Saylor proposed a digital asset framework for the United States Recently, the crypto ambassador proposed a digital asset framework for the world’s most powerful economy. The framework included the Bitcoin strategic reserve, which has the potential to offset the US national debt due to its ability to offer up to $81 trillion in asset wealth. According to the MicroStrategy co-founder’s plan, the US dollar can maintain its position as the global reserve currency by growing the market capitalization of the digital asset sector to $10 trillion. He believes that growth in the digital market will propel the demand for the US dollar and the securities that back overcollateralized stablecoins like Tether’s USDt. Michael Saylor has also suggested a tax on digital assets, including what to tax. Among the taxable items include digital tokens, digital commodities, digital securities, and digital ABTs securing real-world commodities.

At present, there’s no indication of a strong trend or reversal, leaving the market in a state of indecision. XRP is moving within a possible triangle pattern , but it’s still uncertain if this will resolve in an upward or downward breakout. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.10. Bitcoin’s Influence on XRP Bitcoin’s recent decline suggests further downside could be in store for altcoins, including XRP. However, XRP is currently sitting at a micro support zone between $2.04 and $2.21. This level is providing some support, but it’s not strong enough to confirm a reversal or significant price action. Price Targets and Key Levels If XRP continues to consolidate, the price may aim for a higher level within the range, potentially reaching around $2.50. However, there’s no clear hint yet that a price surge is coming. If the price breaks below the $2.04 support level, this could signal a deeper decline, with the next potential support area lying around $1.8. Blue Scenario: Deeper Decline If XRP drops below $2.04, the likelihood of a more significant price correction increases. In this case, the next support levels to watch would be $1.8, $1.63, and $1.53. A further drop could see price levels approaching $1.36–$1.39, where a stronger buying response might be seen. Coinpedia Analysis (Short Term): XRP’s price is currently facing resistance at key levels, $2.2857 and $2.2821, suggesting strong overhead pressure. Additional resistance is found at $2.2442 and $2.2131, with a potential retracement seen at the 38.2% level from the 4-week low, which is near $2.1807. The Pivot Point is set at $2.1648, while the previous close stands at $2.1441, and the last price is at $2.1037, indicating bearish sentiment in the market. At this point, the outlook for XRP is cautiously neutral. If the price holds above $2.0958, it may attempt a move towards higher resistance levels. However, if the price breaks below $2.0707, it could face further declines, with the next key support area near $2.0475.",NEGATIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-30/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

The Irkutsk Region Prosecutor-General’s Office posted on VK , explaining that an unnamed Irkutsk-based “electric grid supply organization” was “found illegally providing a plot of land” to crypto miners. Siberian Power Grid Company ‘Leased Land to Crypto Miners’ The prosecutors explained that the state had set aside the plot to help provide “public utilities.” Instead, however, the unnamed company leased the land to crypto miners, who built a “mining farm” on the property. A crypto mining “farm” in Russia’s Irkutsk. (Source: Irkutsk Region Prosecutor-General’s Office) The office said that it had fined the power provider 330 thousand rubles (over $3,120) and censured the firm. Prosecutors have also opened an administrative case against the power company. Russia faces increasing difficulty shipping commodities to China through its vast eastern rail network, a sign of the growing economic challenges stemming from war and sanctions, despite the Kremlin’s assurances that all is well https://t.co/g5wUeUkYBg — Bloomberg Economics (@economics) December 28, 2024 Russia’s Illegal Mining Problem The case appears to illustrate not only the ongoing popularity of crypto mining in Russia, but also the enormity of the challenge to eliminate illegal mining. Siberia has struggled with power problems in the winter months in recent years, with crypto miners repeatedly blamed. Miners favor the low operating costs of crypto mining farms in Siberia. They also favor the area’s cheap power costs and famously low winter temperatures, which help reduce cooling fees. However, this has resulted in power outages and grid instability in Irkutsk and nearby regions. Moscow has responded by issuing temporary crypto mining bans in several Siberian regions . The bans have done little to stop illegal crypto mining in Siberia, however, with Irkutsk authorities attempting to crack down on offenders .

Some appear to believe that they can find a solution that would satisfy both power companies and Russian crypto miners outside Southern and Eastern Siberia. The Tyumen-based news outlet 72.ru reported that developers in Zavodoukovsk have put a Bitcoin (BTC) mining farm housed on a 20-acre plot of land up for sale. The plot comprises a 550 sqm building with a 150 kWh power supply and 40 ASIC mining rigs. In its current state, the farm mines “BTC 0.26600499 per month,” the developer explained. The vendor said they were selling the farm for around $95,000, and claimed that miners could expect to pay around $0.02 per kW of power. FederalPress wrote that the vendor appears to be “assembling ready-made crypto mining facilities for future ‘farmers.’” The outlet noted that the same vendor appears to have listed another farm for sale at around $143,000.

Media reports also claim that the majority state-owned gas giant Gazprom’s crypto mining-focused subsidiary is building a 5,000-rig crypto mining center in the historic city of Veliky Novgorod, some 570km northwest of Moscow. Sources claim this facility will reach full capacity by 2028, and note that Gazprom has provided its crypto mining arm with a $452.4 million budget. Some Russian firms are still focusing their efforts on Eastern Siberia, however. These include BitRiver, Russia’s biggest industrial crypto mining firm, which is building a new 100MW data center in Buryatia . Officials say the new center will be “the largest data center in the Republic of Buryatia and the Far Eastern Federal District.” The post ‘Crypto Miner-hunting’ Siberian Power Provider Finds Illegal ‘Farm’ on Its Own Property appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-miner-hunting-siberian-power-provider-finds-illegal-farm-on-its-own-property/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38299137.jpeg

38288525,https://nulltx.com/?p=137201,1735524922,"Best Cryptos to Invest in December 2024 | Qubetics, Bitcoin, Avalanche Insights","Best Cryptos to Invest in December 2024: Why Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Avalanche Stand Out The cryptocurrency market has been a rollercoaster ride, no doubt about it. For seasoned investors and first-timers alike, figuring out which digital assets to add to your portfolio can feel like a guessing game. But with December 2024 upon us, it’s time to narrow down the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. If you’re hunting for high-growth potential and reliable market positions, Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Avalanche have become go-to names for investors worldwide. While Bitcoin has long been the king of crypto and Avalanche has built a reputation for its high-speed blockchain network, Qubetics is making headlines with its presale success and cutting-edge innovation. This article breaks down what makes these projects shine, focusing on their milestones, market position, and unique value propositions for investors today. Let’s dive in. Qubetics: The Rising Star of 2024 Qubetics is the latest crypto buzz, and for good reason. This up-and-coming project is in its 14th presale stage, already raking in over $8.1 million. Over 12,400 token holders have snapped up more than 385 million $TICS tokens, showing the undeniable appetite for what this project brings to the table. Currently priced at just $0.037 per token, $TICS is positioned for an imminent 10% price jump by the weekend—an enticing opportunity for investors who know timing is everything. So, what’s driving all this excitement? At its core, Qubetics offers QUBEQODE IDE, an intuitive ecosystem that’s revolutionising workflows for businesses, professionals, and even freelancers. Picture this: A small business uses QUBEQODE IDE to automate inventory tracking, saving hours of manual labour. Or think of a freelance designer seamlessly integrating client feedback into their workflow using this dynamic tool. Whether you’re an entrepreneur or a digital nomad, QUBEQODE IDE makes life easier—and that’s not just a buzzword. Analysts are buzzing with optimistic predictions for $TICS. By the presale’s end, the token is expected to hit $0.25, offering a staggering 630% ROI. The real fireworks, however, come after the presale, with projections of $1 per token for a 2,820% ROI and even $15 after the mainnet launch—a jaw-dropping 43,711% ROI. Think about this: investing $100 in $TICS today could potentially grow to $43,711 in just a few years. With its innovative tech and proven presale momentum, Qubetics isn’t just a rising star; it’s poised to be a game-changer. But don’t wait too long—the 13th stage price won’t last forever. Bitcoin: The Resilient Titan Bitcoin—the OG of cryptocurrency. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has solidified its position as the market’s gold standard. Over the years, it’s served as a hedge against inflation, a decentralised alternative to traditional banking, and a digital asset with sky-high growth potential. Despite market fluctuations, Bitcoin continues to hold its crown as the top crypto by market capitalisation, and it remains one of the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Why is Bitcoin still a go-to for investors? Its simplicity and scarcity are part of its charm. With only 21 million bitcoins ever to exist, this digital asset is the definition of “digital gold.” When economic uncertainty looms, institutional and retail investors alike flock to Bitcoin, driving its price up. Just look at the past decade: Bitcoin’s price climbed from a mere few cents to its current value in the tens of thousands. Even now, Bitcoin’s dominance in the market makes it a reliable store of value. Imagine holding Bitcoin during a bearish market; while altcoins dip, Bitcoin’s resilience often provides a buffer. Many North Americans see Bitcoin as the ultimate crypto starter pack—it’s safe, it’s predictable, and it’s still packed with upside potential. Whether you’re a first-time investor or a seasoned trader, Bitcoin has proven time and again why it deserves a spot in your portfolio. Avalanche: Speed Meets Scalability Then there’s Avalanche, the speedster of the crypto world. Known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and ultra-low fees, Avalanche has carved out a unique niche in the blockchain landscape. In 2024, this project has cemented its reputation as a powerhouse for decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. It’s no wonder Avalanche has become one of the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Avalanche’s claim to fame lies in its ability to process up to 4,500 transactions per second (TPS). Compare that to Ethereum’s 15-30 TPS, and it’s clear why developers and users are flocking to this platform. Avalanche’s subnets allow developers to create custom blockchains tailored to specific needs, making it a favourite among businesses and institutions looking to leverage blockchain tech without the bottlenecks. Picture this: A gaming company uses Avalanche to power its in-game economy, ensuring players can trade assets seamlessly without delays. Or consider a DeFi project that launches on Avalanche, taking advantage of its low fees to attract users fed up with Ethereum’s gas prices. These real-world use cases highlight why Avalanche is more than just a fast blockchain; it’s a practical solution for today’s blockchain challenges. As Avalanche’s ecosystem grows, so does its market value. Analysts predict steady price appreciation for AVAX, making it a smart play for both short-term gains and long-term holds. If you’re looking for a crypto project with cutting-edge technology and real-world utility, Avalanche delivers on both fronts. Conclusion: Make Your Move Before It’s Too Late The cryptocurrency market is full of opportunities, but timing is everything. Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Avalanche each offer unique value propositions that cater to different types of investors. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’ presale buzz, Bitcoin’s time-tested resilience, or Avalanche’s high-speed innovation, these projects are undoubtedly the best cryptos to invest in December 2024.

Dogecoin price remains in the spotlight due to its market buzz, while Shiba Inu faces crucial backing issues. On the other side, BlockDAG (BDAG) introduces a well-organized and beneficial setup for its users. BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle not only offers significant cash prizes but also bolsters participants’ crypto holdings with substantial BDAG bonuses, providing real value apart from the raffle itself. In contrast to the unstable conditions of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, BlockDAG demonstrates steady expansion and growing confidence, making a strong argument for its sustainable approach. BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle Offers Cash Prizes + Crypto Bonuses! BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle is more than an opportunity to win a considerable cash prize—it also rewards participants with valuable crypto bonuses. This dual benefit ensures that each participant gains more than their initial involvement, no matter the raffle’s result. Specifically, each ticket purchased comes with a 200% bonus in BDAG coins, BlockDAG’s native coin. For example, a Bronze Ticket at 125 USDT not only qualifies buyers for a drawing with a top prize of $250,000 USDT but also triples their BDAG coin balance. Moreover, Silver and Gold tickets, costing 250 USDT and 500 USDT respectively, escalate not only buyer’s prize chances but also their BDAG coin quantity, with the Gold Ticket offering the highest likelihood of winning the $1M USDT top prize. Thus, this raffle extends beyond mere luck; it’s a chance to boost participant’s crypto collection. Furthermore, the BDAG bonuses empower participants to deepen their involvement in the BlockDAG network, making the tickets a wise decision for those aiming to increase their holdings. The additional crypto incentives also introduce a thrilling element of strategy, enhancing the overall raffle experience. Meanwhile, BlockDAG continues to impress in the crypto market. Now in its 26th presale batch, the initiative has secured $173 million from over 17.5 billion sold BDAG coins. Notably, with the coin price currently at $0.0234, marking a 2240% rise since the initial batch, the growing demand and strong confidence are evident. Surge in Dogecoin Price: 90M DOGE Swapped in Two Days Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently seen a notable increase in activity, with its price soaring as 90 million DOGE changed hands over a span of just 48 hours. This significant trading volume highlights Dogecoin’s escalating appeal and the growing enthusiasm around it from both casual and seasoned crypto enthusiasts. Additionally, this surge in trading activity has led to a notable rise in Dogecoin’s market value, further cementing its status in the crypto arena. Analysts believe this uptrend results from wider acceptance, high-profile endorsements, and an overall positive outlook in the crypto environment. Shiba Inu Encounters Key Price Support Test Shiba Inu (SHIB), the well-known meme-based cryptocurrency, finds itself in a delicate position as it attempts to hold onto a critical price threshold. Market data shows that around 16 trillion SHIB tokens are under threat, which could have serious repercussions for the market. This scenario has led to a marked decrease in SHIB’s value, penetrating key price floors that once provided stability. This downturn has sparked worry within the SHIB community and among market analysts, as the absence of solid support could lead to further declines in value. Market sentiment is crucial in these situations. While current negative trends might provoke quick sell-offs, exacerbating the price drop, positive changes within the Shiba Inu framework might rebuild trust and help stabilize its market position. Final Verdict In a market rapidly swinging with unpredictable patterns, BlockDAG introduces a refreshing strategy by blending real rewards with prospects for sustained growth. While Dogecoin Price surges and Shiba Inu’s support issues underscore the crypto market’s instability, BlockDAG’s planned initiatives, like the $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle, demonstrate a more stable approach. Through significant BDAG rewards and steady progression, BlockDAG distinguishes itself as a focus on both user involvement and long-term viability. For those looking beyond quick profits, this highlights the benefits of deliberate engagement in a well-crafted crypto ecosystem.

Simultaneously, SUI has notched a new all-time high (ATH) of $2.37, underpinned by a surge in trading volume that signals robust investor enthusiasm. Parallel to these developments, Web3Bay (3BAY) is pioneering a shift in online shopping by deploying Web3 technologies within a decentralized marketplace powered by its 3BAY token. With an introductory presale price of just $0.003, Web3Bay offers an inviting 6430% ROI potential, crafting a not-to-be-missed chance for early adopters keen on championing this trailblazing project. ETC Price Prediction: Analyst Foresees Growth Leading analyst Alan Santana has projected a robust outlook for Ethereum Classic (ETC), emphasizing its longest accumulation period since January 2022, which could mirror the phenomenal 5,700% value surge seen during the 2018–2021 bull cycle. While current predictions suggest gains between 1,300% to 2,150% from its June 2022 lows, such a prolonged buildup sets the stage for potentially explosive growth under the right market conditions. SUI Achieves a Milestone with Unprecedented Trading Volumes SUI has reached an exhilarating new high at $2.37, propelled by a groundbreaking $2 billion trading volume that indicates intense market interest. Recorded on November 6, this spike in activity, with a slight preference for long positions as per Coinglass data (Long/Short ratio of 1.09), points to strong investor confidence. Although there’s potential for further ascent, possibly touching $3, the market also braces for possible pullbacks that could recalibrate the price closer to $1.93. This ATH underscores SUI’s dynamic market trajectory and investor optimism. 3BAY Token: Fueling the First Decentralized Marketplace At the core of Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace, the 3BAY token not only facilitates transactions but also embeds governance rights for its holders, empowering them to directly influence the platform’s future.

Web3Bay redefines online shopping with its decentralized platform, where users retain complete data ownership and enjoy lower transaction fees. Enhanced with IPFS technology for decentralized storage and cross-chain compatibility, Web3Bay addresses prevalent e-commerce challenges such as data security and transparency, while offering a worldwide, open transactional environment. The 3BAY token presale offers an unparalleled starting point at just $0.003. Early investors not only secure a cost advantage but also join an innovative endeavor set to redefine e-commerce by prioritizing user control. With its distinct features and promising growth trajectory, the presale phase of Web3Bay provides a rare opportunity to support a pioneering platform set to transform the online shopping landscape. This chance for early involvement invites those eager to engage in a groundbreaking venture with substantial return potential. In Summary As the market watches Ethereum Classic (ETC) for signs of its anticipated bull run and SUI continues to build momentum following its ATH, Web3Bay stands out with a unique proposition. Integrating Web3 into e-commerce, Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace offers users unprecedented control over their data and transactions.

This Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which has largely paid off, has continued up until now. According to recent data, El Salvador has now crossed the 6,000 BTC threshold. This makes El Salvador the sixth country behind the likes of the US, the UK, and Bhutan to hold 6,000 BTC or more. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy Reaches New Milestone Unlike countries like the US and the UK, whose Bitcoin holdings are from seized assets from criminals, El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings have been through consistent purchases. Notably, El Salvador’s deliberate and consistent approach to building a Bitcoin reserve has been a cornerstone of President Bukele’s vision to establish the small Central American country as a leader in the crypto industry. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ending 2024 On A High Note? Analysts Say This Level Is Key According to data from the official website of El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio tracker, the country added another BTC to its reserve in the past 24 hours. This BTC was acquired at $94,702 and essentially pushed the total holdings to 6,000.77 BTC. Interestingly, a detailed look at the data shows that El Salvador has purchased around 50 more BTC since the beginning of December. This growth has mostly been consistent with 1 BTC purchased each day, except for December 20 and December 22, which were highlighted by purchases of 11 BTC. At the time of writing, El Salvador’s Bitcoin stash is worth a little over $570 million. This value has grown massively in the past three months and could grow more in 2025. Particularly, El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio reached a peak value of $643 million on December 17 when the Bitcoin price peaked at $108,135. Image from bitcoin.gob.sv Outlook For El Salvador’s Bitcoin Stash Despite initial skepticism from international organizations and financial experts, this strategy appears to have yielded positive results over time, largely due to Bitcoin’s price surge this year. According to data from nayibtracker.com, El Salvador is currently sitting on $157 million in profit from its Bitcoin purchases, having bought its 6,000 BTC at an average price of $45,465. El Salvador’s first Bitcoin purchase was made in September 2021 and is currently showing no signs of stopping soon. However, the country did reach an agreement recently with the IMF to scale back its Bitcoin purchase trends in order to be able to secure funding. Although this agreement was made on December 18, El Salvador doubled down and bought 11 more BTC just days later.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days.

CryptoQuant CEO Questions US’s Next Move,"Since President-elect Donald Trump raised the possibility of establishing a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, many advocates have pushed for the creation of the crypto stockpile, saying that it would make the country as the leader in the global cryptocurrency landscape. However, not everyone in the crypto community is convinced of the feasibility of the crypto reserve. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju is pessimistic that the prospect of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve would get an approval from the incoming administration. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $350K? Kiyosaki Stands Firm Amid BlackRock ETF Drama BTC Reserve Doubtful Young Ju is not convinced that the proposed Bitcoin reserve would push through, saying it is unlikely that Trump would embrace the crypto strategy to protect US dollar dominance because the greenback remains a safe haven currency. Throughout history, whenever the United States perceived a threat to its dominance in the global economy, gold prices surged, and debates around the gold standard gained traction. In the late 1990s, Peter Schiff championed gold as the true form of money, much like today’s… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 28, 2024 The executive of CryptoQuant thinks that the policies of the new government would be much influenced by the apparent strength of the US economy and the predominance of the American currency in international trade. Young Ju said that if there is a perceived threat to the US economic hegemony, gold, Bitcoin or any other store-of-value assets would experience a surge in its price. US Economy Still Dominates Young Ju argued that there is no perceived threat to American dominance since many investors still have great confidence in the US economy or the US dollar. “I personally support the idea of #Bitcoin Standard. However, I question whether the US, while continuing to grow as other economies stagnate, would adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset,” he said in a post. The crypto executive believes the debate on the Bitcoin reserve would only gain serious momentum if the country’s global economic dominance is “genuinely threatened,” adding, “At present, market sentiment suggests confidence in the US’ continued supremacy.” The US processed 37.8% of the world’s Bitcoin in 2022, making it the leader in crypto mining, according to government data. Crypto Stance Could Shift Young Ju said that it is possible that Trump’s stance on Bitcoin may take an unexpected turn depending on the broader political landscape. “If Trump succeeds in showcasing US economic resilience, reinforcing the dollar’s supremacy, and boosting his approval ratings, it’s unclear if he would maintain the strong pro-Bitcoin stance he demonstrated during his campaign,” he explained in a post. Related Reading: CME Gap Threatens Bitcoin With Potential Drop To $77,000 – Analyst The CryptoQuant CEO suggested that more likely, Trump would “step back from his Bitcoin advocacy,” pointing out that he might cite that there has been a change in priorities, “without alienating his voter base.” “At the BTC Conference, was his mention of Bitcoin as a strategic asset a genuine step toward preparing for a Bitcoin Standard, or merely a calculated move to secure votes?” he said. For the crypto executive, it is still unsure which of Trump’s “campaign rhetoric on Bitcoin” will be fulfilled.

38291306,https://invezz.com/?p=2409582,1735516920,TRX price prediction as Tron flips Ethereum on key metric,"The Tron price has dived in the past few weeks as most cryptocurrency prices have recoiled. TRX fell from a high of $0.4506 on December 4 to a low of $0.2600, a 42% decline. So, what’s next for Tron as it flips Ethereum in terms of the fee collected? Tron network is making more money than Ethereum Ethereum has been the most profitable blockchain network in the past few years, thanks to its higher fees and activity on the platform. It remains the most popular blockchain network today, with a substantial market share against most chains. For example, Ethereum’s blockchain has a total value locked (TVL) of over $68 billion and bridged volume of near $200 billion It also has over $111 billion in stablecoins in its ecosystem. In contrast, Justin Sun’s Tron has a TVL of $7.4 billion, bridged value od $68 billion, and $60 billion in stablecoins. It has just 34 DeFi apps in its ecosystem, while Ethereum has over 1,263 of them. Still, Tron is now making more money than Ethereum. According to TokenTerminal, Tron has made over $1.3 billion in fees in the last 180 days, higher than Ethereum’s $800 million. The same trend happened in the last 30 days as the two made $333 million and $217 million, respectively. These numbers mean that the Tron network is seeing more transactions and collecting more money. If the trend continues, its annual fees in 2025 could be higher than Ethereum’s. Ethereum has made over $2.46 billion in the last 365 days compared to Tron’s $2.12 billion. Tron’s rising fees is likely because of the SunPump ecosystem that led to more activity in the network. SunPump is a rival to Solana’s Pump.fun in that it helps users create meme coins within minutes. SunPump’s ecosystem started well and gained thousands of meme coins within days. Recently, however, there are signs that the network has lost steam as the market cap of all of its tokens has dropped from over $700 million a few months ago to $144 million today. The biggest of these tokens are Sundog, Tron Bull, Tron Bull Coin, Suncat, and SunWukong. The rising Tron fees mean that its stakers are making substantial returns. Tron has a staking market cap of over $10 billion , giving it a staking ratio of 46%. Its staking yield has moved to 4.65%, higher than Ethereum’s 3.03%. Tron price analysis TRX price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the TRX price has moved into a deep bear market after falling by over 42% from its highest level this year. Still, TRX remains above the 50-day moving average, a sign that it has the potential to rebound. It is also a sign that it is doing mean reversion, where an asset returns to its normal average after soaring hard. Tron has also moved above the ascending trendline that connects its lowest swings since June this year. It has also formed a falling wedge chart pattern, a popular reversal sign. Therefore, the TRX price will likely bounce back, and hit its all-time high of $0.4506, its highest level this year, which is about 73% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.2232 will invalidate the bullish view.

38284995,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634599,1735516830,"Nvidia ruled 2024, but 2025 holds tough challenges","2024 was a great year for Nvidia, making it the clear leader in the AI market with smart technology and investments. In 2025, Nvidia will face increased competition from AMD, Intel, and tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, who are developing their own AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia’s products. Nvidia has had a great year in 2024. The ranking has placed the company, without a doubt, at the top of the artificial intelligence market. Innovative AI technologies and strategic investments in cutting-edge hardware have fast-tracked this event’s share price and revenue. Nvidia’s 2024 Dominance NVIDIA became the most valuable publicly traded company worldwide by breaking past Apple and crossing $3 trillion. Jensen Huang, CEO took over this company and steered its growth to the maximum that has ever happened. Nvidia products underpin most AI innovation across industries. Nvidia’s Blackwell chip, designed explicitly for AI applications, will drive the market in 2025, however, this success does not predict an easy future for the company. Nvidia’s fortune can be traced primarily to its early investments in AI software and hardware. Its CUDA software helps developers build applications for chips made by Nvidia. Hyperscalers—which include Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta in the massive cloud computing providers crowd rely on Nvidia for the powerful GPUs that are used for AI model training. The company’s business with data centres generated 87% of revenues during the most recent quarter, one major area driving the firm financially. Currently, Nvidia remains at the head of the AI band, and chips from Blackwell are in very high demand. This is further attested to by customers such as Amazon, who already have the data centres readied in preparation for the immense amount of power and heat expected from the new processors being developed. This signifies how Nvidia is crucial in this AI revolution. 2025 Challenges But, by 2025, challenges are coming up rapidly against Nvidia’s leadership position. AMD and Intel, in particular, continue developing their AI-centric chips; AMD seems better suited than any competitor to cut into Nvidia’s lead in a big way. MI300X from AMD can be directly positioned as the H100 Hopper Nvidia develops. At this time, Intel is still unable to regain its ground, and AMD’s products are much more competitive. Further advanced software development could make its chips more appealing to developers and cloud providers. But now, another emerging risk is the danger of its customers starting to build AI chips themselves. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have started designing their semiconductors, reducing dependence on those semiconductors that would be required from Nvidia. While these companies still have to purchase chips from Nvidia, this would progressively reduce Nvidia’s share of the market in the future. Further, the shift to inferencing by AI models, which involves putting AI models into actual operating environments, may help lower the need for powerhouse chips like the one for which Nvidia is famous because inferencing requires very little computation to perform what’s needed compared to training. Despite all these potential risks, Nvidia is well positioned to remain the AI powerhouse in 2025, having caught the imagination and interest of innovators. Nvidia remains the default choice of chips in training large-scale AI models Traditional chipmakers like AMD and Intel, as well as the customers interested in their own AI solutions, will begin to throw corporate weight behind Nvidia, demanding serious intervention from the company’s management. 2025 is going to be difficult for them.
