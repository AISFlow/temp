42377215,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyAB,1400102216,Paying Workers in Bitcoin May Be Illegal Under Swiss Law,"Despite the growing interest digital currency employers have shown in paying their workers in bitcoin and its alternatives, a new report suggests that the practice may not be legal in Switzerland, one of the global leaders in banking and finance.  Entitled 'The Legality of Wage Payment in Bitcoin under Swiss Labour Law', the report was penned by Swiss Socialist Party member Jean Christophe Schwaab, who was notably called upon to draft a study on the dangers of bitcoin last December.  Schwaab's report could have broad implications, as it suggests that the payment of any potentially volatile assets in exchange for employment services is not legal under Swiss law.  Schwaab told CoinDesk:    ""According to Swiss labour law, it is lawful to pay all or part of wages in kind or in foreign currency, provided that the amount paid matches the amount in Swiss franc contractually agreed by the parties or required by the collective labour agreement.      However, the payment of wages in kind or in foreign currency must not cause a postponement of economic risk on the worker, because this risk must in all cases be borne by the employer.""    The report comes just weeks after bitcoin-focused payroll solution provider Bitwage released a survey suggesting that nearly one in two bitcoin companies are open to compensating workers in digital currency.  Volatility a key issue  Schwaab asserts that the central roadblock to bitcoin wage payments is bitcoin's price volatility, which cannot be legally passed on from an employer to an employee per the country's Federal Act on the Amendment of the Swiss Civil Code.  Because of bitcoin's rapid fluctuations in value, Schwaab says, workers would be unable to anticipate their income. The regulation in question, he says, mandates that any salary payments should be sustained in value for at least one month after the payment.  Furthermore, he said, the rules are mandatory, meaning Swiss workers are not able to waive this right under the law to accept bitcoin wages.  Bitcoin bonuses are lawful  The report did not fully limit bitcoin transactions between employers and employees, however.  For example, Schwaab noted that there is no law that prohibits employees from exchanging the wages they earn for bitcoin. Further, he suggested that payments that are unrelated to a regular full-time salary would be allowed:  ""A bonus (for example, at the end of the year) in bitcoin is generally lawful.""  Community reactions  Speaking to CoinDesk, members of local digital currency trade organization Bitcoin Alliance Switzerland (BAS) weighed in on the report.  BAS president Luzius Meisser disagreed with Schwaab's findings, noting how Swiss workers are regularly compensated in payments that do not include the country's native currency, the Swiss franc (CHF), and that a similar discussion also took place when Swiss lawmakers evaluated the legality of salary payments in euros.  ""Swiss workers regularly receive part of their salary in non-CHF form. For example, when a company provides free food to employees – above a certain level – its value is added to the income and taxed like the regular salary,"" Meisser said.  BAS vice president Alexis Roussel believes that even with the findings of the report, it would be possible for digital currency businesses to pay workers in bitcoin, provided ""specific measures are taken by the company to hedge the risk for the employee to ensure [their] revenues are stable"".  Meisser went on to suggest Schwaab's report may be skewed due to his political associations, stating:  ""I am not an expert, but I would take everything that comes from Schwaab with a grain of salt as he is member of the Socialist Party, which was in 2011 also against paying employees in euros.""  Despite the report's findings and implications, Meisser doesn't believe it will have a negative affect on the local startup scene:  ""Founders and employees at startups are risk-takers by definition. Here, minimal fixed salaries (sometimes zero) and a high variable bonus (be it in form of equity or bitcoins) are normal.""  ""Regardless of what Schwaab's opinion is, startups will continue to do what makes sense to them,"" he added.

42377228,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyPH,1400098571,BitPay Unveils Test Payments Platform for Developers,"Georgia-based bitcoin payment processor BitPay has announced that it now offers a complete testing platform for developers.  The goal is to allow developers access to the company's bitcoin payment processing and payroll capabilities in a way that doesn't require the use of its live system.  This platform will enable developers to better use continuous delivery methodologies for software updates – a popular way to release new features, since most software is now built on the web as a service.  The blog post states:  ""One of the key attributes supporting an effective DevOps strategy is the presence of a release process that includes a continuous delivery pipeline.""  BitPay  is one of the largest merchant processors for bitcoin, having recently announced $30m in Series A funding from investors including Richard Branson and Index Ventures.  Testnet plus BitPay  Smaller startups working on bitcoin projects use bitcoin testnet – an implementation that allows for use of the bitcoin protocol without requiring actual funds to be spent in the process.  However, larger organizations go through a rigorous software development lifecycle. For example, there is a need for a complete environment in addition to bitcoin testnet when building out enterprise-grade products.  BitPay's testing platform offers this functionality, and as such, it's a potential signal that the company expects larger IT organizations to implement bitcoin-related projects within enterprise-level systems.  Faster testing  Another key motivation for BitPay to launch this robust test environment was that developers previously needed to obtain access to bank deposit account and routing information before testing the system's capabilities.  Now, instead of having to use the company's production server for testing transactions, developers can trial their software without explicitly accessing bank accounts.  Reconciliation, as a result, can be tested prior to actually depositing or withdrawing real money for smaller organizations.  In addition, this test environment doesn't go through BitPay's know your customer (KYC) procedures that exists in the production system, which should allow for faster debugging and iteration during software testing.

42377211,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zy59,1400096482,Butterfly Labs Customers Appeal to FTC for $1 Million in Missing Orders,"A new report reveals that ButterflyLabs customers have submitted 283 complaints against the company – worth more than $1m in combined refunds and late orders – to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) since 2012.  According to documents revealed by Ars Technica, the complaints against the Kansas-based ASIC miner manufacturer are for orders totalling $1,016,243 across a period of about 17 months (see the report data here).  The first complaint was filed in September 2012, with the most recent complaint having been submitted on 15th April of this year.  Notably, one entry made a claim for $30m with no date attached. This entry has been omitted from our tally of orders claimed from ButterflyLabs.  Complaints over delays  The FTC complaints range from outstanding orders to refunds that have not been received.  One customer in Hawaii, who paid $30,247 to ButterflyLabs last March, but is still awaiting their shipment, wrote:  ""Please! Somebody help us, I'm not the only one trying to get a refund from these crooks. I beg you, please someone look into this!""  According to Ars Technica, ButterflyLabs lost a civil case last November, with the plaintiff receiving an award of $13,000. The company is also facing a class-action lawsuit filed last month to recover an alleged $25m in customer pre-payments.  Noah Wood, one of the lawyers representing the customers, wrote in a post announcing the suit:  ""Stopping the bad actors and staying vigilant against consumer fraud is absolutely necessary for the successful development of the bitcoin ecosystem.""  Federal penalties possible  The FTC complaints are only the first step in a process that may see Butterfly Labs investigated by law enforcement agencies.  The firm could also face civll penalties imposed by the FTC, which is charged with enforcing a variety of antitrust and consumer protection laws, including fraud.  However, there is no guarantee these customer complaints will result in any form of restitution, according to a FTC spokesperson, who told Ars Techina:  “Complaints are used by FTC and partner law enforcement agencies to detect patterns of fraud and abuse, which may lead to investigations and eliminate unfair business practices.""

42377223,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zyIz,1400089927,Shutdown of China's FXBTC Exchange Leads to Customer Outrage,"Some former customers of the now-defunct China-based digital currency exchange FXBTC are reporting that its operators are still holding customer funds, and that their attempts to retrieve their holdings have been unsuccessful.  Reports suggest these customers did not receive word that the exchange was shutting down, and as a result, did not withdraw funds before a deadline set by FXBTC.  The exchange announced it would close due to pressure from the country's central bank on 2nd May, informing customers at the time that they would have until 10th May to withdraw funds from the exchange.  Caixin's Li Xiaoxiao, who first broke the news that the People's Bank of China would seek to more tightly enforce bitcoin restrictions, however, is reporting that some site users have also reported difficulty obtaining funds prior to this deadline, writing:  ""The website notice stated that the website would be open until [10th May]. However, as of 24:00 on [9th May], the FXBTC website was shut down, and some users had not yet withdrawn their money or coins in time, but the website's customer support was already unavailable.""  Exchange users have reported the incident to Shanghai's Xujiahui District Public Safety Bureau, though reports suggest that this agency still needs to formally accept the case in order for former users to seek restitution.  Withdrawal issues  Withdrawal issues began prior to 10th May, when the rapid removal of funds from FXBTC accounts caused the price of BTC to decline rapidly on the platform.  By 8th May, reports say, the price of bitcoin on FXBTC was 500 RMB (0.18 BTC or roughly $80 at press time) below the price listed on other exchanges.  Customers who left money in the exchange say they have not received word from the company as to if and when they can retrieve their holdings.  The total amount of customer funds allegedly being held by the exchange is not yet known, though sources told CoinDesk the overall value of bitcoins and litecoins could be between $8,000 and $13,000.  Next steps  Notably, members of China's bitcoin community had previously raised concerns about the exchange's closure and subsequent plans for the distribution of customer funds, including BTC China and Bitcoin Foundation board member-elect Bobby Lee.  China-based media outlets are reporting that attempts by former exchange users and reporters to contact FXBTC have been unsuccessful.  One source told Xiaoxiao that he is optimistic any remaining funds will be returned, though, saying ""this website has been pretty low-key, and probably wouldn't maliciously run away with funds"".

42425673,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewNh,1400086718,eBay CEO: We Are 'Actively Considering' Bitcoin Integration,"eBay CEO John Donahoe told shareholders at the annual meeting in San Jose, California, yesterday that the company is “actively considering” integrating bitcoin with PayPal.  When asked by a shareholder about bitcoin’s potential role in global trade, Donahoe responded by saying that the digital currency “will play a very important role in the future”, eCommerce Bytes reports.  While Donahoe said he couldn’t envision exactly how bitcoin could become a more mainstream technology, he suggested that eBay is considering direct involvement with the digital currency, saying:  “Exactly how that plays out, and how we can best take advantage of it and enable it with PayPal, that's something we're actively considering. It's on our radar screen.""  Evolving stance  This is not the first time that Donahoe has commented on the company’s interest in bitcoin. Last year, the eBay CEO stated that a bitcoin payment option may eventually be added to PayPal.  Yet the new statements are more positive than the ones made last year. In 2013, Donahoe said eBay was “kind of thinking about” integrating bitcoin, suggesting that the company was investigating the digital currency:  “I’ve been spending a lot of time looking at it and it’s truly fascinating. The way that the currency has been designed and the way inflation is built in to pay for miners and all of that is truly fascinating.  Interestingly, Donahoe’s latest comments were made on behalf of the company, rather than from a personal perspective. It remains to be seen how – and when – eBay approaches the topic of bitcoin integration in the near future.  Donahoe isn’t the only executive involved to voice his support for bitcoin. Last year, PayPal president David Marcus remarked that he is a fan of the digital currency and said that he, too, thinks a bitcoin option could one day be added.  Existing engagement  Despite not integrating bitcoin as a payment option, eBay has already seen some digital currency activity on its site.  In early April, the online marketplace added a “Virtual Currency” category. The section allows users to buy and sell digital currencies, mining hardware and mining contracts.  Notably, the company did not actively advertise the new category's addition, instead quietly modifying an existing section.  eBay has also moved to create a new digital currency payment system, which would include bitcoin as one of several options, according to a patent application filed by the company in December 2011. It is also developing a digital wallet designed to hold multiple types of currency.

42425693,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewvh,1400079848,Hive Launches Android Bitcoin Wallet with Built-In App Store,"Hive, a geographically distributed startup that builds bitcoin wallets, launched a beta version of its Android wallet app today.  Jan Vornberger, lead developer of the app, said that the company's product has key differences that will make it stand out in the crowded Android marketplace.  One of those features is the ability to host third-party bitcoin applications within the wallet – effectively, a Hive app store. Vornberger told CoinDesk:  ""I would say it's our app platform, which makes Hive extensible, [is the big differentiator].""  Simple interface  Hive  focused on offering a very user friendly experience with its first product, a wallet for Mac OS X desktops and laptops, and Vornberger has taken that ethos to the Android platform.    There are essentially two main screens for Hive's main wallet functions; the first of which – a contacts list – appears when the app is started up.      If a wallet contact is also included in the Android device's address book, Hive will show that person's associated image. Swiping to the right takes the user to the transaction history.      Hive sensibly offers reminders that backing up the wallet is good practice and allows you to save the wallet's key information in a secondary place, like Google Drive, in case the device is lost.    Hive's app store  Hive made its name via an easy and reliable introductory bitcoin wallet for Mac OS X. Now, this move to Android brings the wallet's simplicity to users on the go.  Added value will come in the form of third-party apps that are accessed from a box icon at the upper right of Hive's main screen. This takes the user to a listing of installed applications.    At the top, there is a marketplace app that allows users to download other applications. Currently, since Hive for Android is still in beta, only a few apps are available.      Truth is, there aren't too many on the Hive desktop client either, as the ecosystem is still small. Furthermore, one notable absentee on Hive's mobile platform is the Coinbase app.      Vornberger explained that the Coinbase app on Mac OS X has been problematic but that the company ""hope to fix that up at some point."" Coinbase as a third-party app would be a great option – a way to move from fiat currency to bitcoin and over to Hive in a few easy steps.    Faster transactions  The Hive Android wallet is one of the first to implement the payment protocol BIP70, which speeds up transactions by sending BTC directly to the recipient without waiting for block-chain confirmation.  BIP70 isn't widely used at the moment, but that may soon change, according to Vornberger:  ""Of course, this only works if the payee also uses the payment protocol. For all BitPay merchants that's already the case, and I expect others will follow as well.""  Vornberger gained experience building mobile bitcoin apps with his previous wallet project Bridgewalker, which was bought by Hive.  He said that, because the Hive app is just starting its beta phase, some aspects are subject to change.  ""The current [user interface] and icon set is just a placeholder for the beta and will probably look different when we release the official version,"" Vornberger pointed out.  Hive is currently available in beta on the Google Play Store.  Disclaimer: This article should not be viewed as an endorsement of Hive.

42425672,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewLh,1400074129,KnCMiner Reveals Additional Titan Scrypt ASIC Specs,"KnCMiner has revealed a few interesting details about its upcoming Titan Scrypt miner, which is expected to ship this summer.  The company updated the Titan spec in March, revising performance figures and pledging to deliver upwards of 250MH/s – it originally promised 100MH/s.  KnC now says that the Titan ASICs will hit 300MH/s. Each miner will include four ASICs featuring a ""record-breaking"" 2,284 cores each. Each chip will be capable of running 18,727 threads, so each Titan will end up with 9,136 cores running 73,088 threads, the company claimed.  KnC says the chips feature 300MB of onboard memory. It is unclear whether this refers to on-die memory or not, as 300MB is a lot to put on a single die and it would take up a lot of silicon acreage. Bear in mind that this is not the equivalent of 300MB of memory on a PC motherboard or graphics card, as ASICs operate in a completely different way.  Some details remain sketchy  KnCMiner  has already made it clear that the Titan ASICs feature a 55mm x 55mm package, but it has not revealed the actual die size or the transistor count. The package size does not tell us much about either metric. For comparison, the KnC Neptune ASIC features 1,440 cores in a 55mm x 55mm package.  KnC says the Titan miner will be able to extract over 300W of thermal energy from each chip. It comes in a relatively compact 60 x 50 x 20cm chassis and it can be powered by a standard ATX power supply.  Comparing the Titan to GPU miners does not make much sense, since the Titan is projected to end up much faster than a Radeon R9 290X (Hawaii XT) graphics card, the fastest single-GPU card used by miners today. Like the Titan ASIC, AMD’s Hawaii GPU can consume up to 300W, but it maxes out at about 1MH/s.  Tape out, shipping dates  KnCMiner says it is planning to announce the final tape-out of Titan ASICs “within the next few weeks”. The miner can be pre-ordered today at $9,995 and shipments are expected in the second or third quarter of the year.  Going from tape-out to full-scale production usually takes a couple of months, so at this rate we are looking at the end of Q2 or early Q3 at best.  However, this is anything but a smooth process. Even big chipmakers and chip designers are prone to delays and a host of technical issues. Designing and manufacturing immensely complex chips such as high-end GPUs or mining ASICs is a daunting task.  Delays are all too common in the world of ASIC miners and there is always a chance something could go wrong, although the news coming out of KnCMiner is encouraging.  In addition to the Titan, the company has also revealed plans to launch a hosted cloud mining service. KnC Cloud is expected to go live soon and the company says it will be releasing details of its ""very competitive"" mining plans promptly. The news is sure to interest Vault of Satoshi who announced a beta cloud mining service of its own this week.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | ZRX,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/14/kncminer-reveals-additional-titan-scrypt-asic-specs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da19994d517143227fd4b3b645f0690229c315ce-483x362.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425691,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewlh,1400067780,Bitcoin-Accepting Restaurant is Malaysia's First,"In another sign that bitcoin awareness is spreading in Southeast Asia, Malaysia now has at least one restaurant accepting the digital currency.  The restaurant, which serves Malaysian specialities, is called Nasi Dagang Capital and can be found in the Damansara Uptown district of Malaysia's largest city, Kuala Lumpur.  Business acceptance across the region has been slow to pick up, mainly due to lack of media attention and knowledge of bitcoin's benefits among merchants, but that may be slowly changing.  As is the case in many other cities, the eatery is the regular venue for KL's weekly bitcoin meetups and the proprietor was convinced to accept bitcoin by enthusiastic participants.  Locally produced payment apps  Nasi Dagang Capital is using merchant payment software developed especially for the Malaysian market by Arsyan Ismail, CEO of company ked.ai.  Available for Android devices in the Google Play store, Bitcoin POS (also known as Bitcoin Terminal) is a point-of-sale app that processes bitcoin payments and deposits local currency into a bank account.  The software calculates total bitcoin payments for one business day and desposits that amount into the merchant's bank account the following morning.  ""A guy on the street selling some hotdog can use the app to accept bitcoin, essentially we are the Square of Malaysia that receives bitcoin to cash,"" said Arsyan.  Bitcoin potential  Despite low acceptance among local businesses, Malaysia has been fortunate with bitcoin so far. It has an active and tech-educated grassroots community, and an online chat group with hundreds of members using the mobile app KakaoTalk to discuss and coordinate trades.  The local advocacy group Bitcoin Malaysia is hard at work, developing ways to get as much bitcoin into local hands as possible via the exchange CryptoMarket.my and low-denomination preloaded scratch cards it sells on its website.  Furthermore, BitX recently expanded its secure wallet service internationally, and plans to launch a full-blown local exchange in 12 emerging markets including Malaysia. Plus, the country can boast two working bitcoin ATMs from Southeast Asian manufacturer Numoni.  Regulatory attitudes in Malaysia are quite liberal and mainly in tune with next-door neighbour Singapore. The Malaysian central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia, announced in January that it did not consider bitcoin to be legal tender, and thus would not seek to regulate its use at all.

42425692,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewth,1400061620,Are Off-Block Chain Transactions Bad for Bitcoin?,"Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized and trustless payment network – with the power to do this provided by the block chain and its ability to publicly confirm the digital currency's digital transactions.  Rather contentiously, however, as the bitcoin economy expands, more and more transactions are being carried out off the block chain.  Such transactions are tracked on private databases instead of the block chain, and cannot be publicly tracked.  There are pros and cons to both systems. So, which are better? Off-block chain or on-block chain transactions?  Visible payments  Legitimate use cases for on-block chain transactions include those that must be shown publicly for particular reasons, such as to facilitate larger payments.  Many users might not mind smaller transactions off the block chain, but bigger transactions can receive public verification with bitcoin's general ledger. So, on-chain is insurance of sorts – proof that a payment exchange between parties did happen.  Marcell Ortutay is the developer of Coinwall, which relays bitcoin microtransactions on the block chain for the purpose of paywalls for online content. He said that, in light of nefarious actors in the cryptocurrency space, on-block chain transactions are a better verifier of sorts:  ""When you use a hosted wallet, you partly lose the digital currency aspect, since you no longer have bitcoins, just promises of bitcoins.""  Perhaps the most noteworthy example of a hosted wallet gone awry would be Mt. Gox. Despite all the warning signs of that exchange's mismanagement, Ortutay points out people still had faith in the Tokyo-based company:  ""As the Mt. Gox situation shows, people are happy to keep their bitcoins on the most untrustworthy hosted wallets out there.""  Need for speed  A number of consumer-based bitcoin companies are focused on off-block chain transactions, including Coinbase, Circle Internet Financial.  These companies are facilitators of everyday payments between parties and, as a result, they have decided to keep transaction speeds high by keeping most payments internal – that is, off the the public block chain.  Scott Robinson runs bitcoin initiatives at the Plug and Play startup accelerator, which has headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. He says this issue is a factious subject within the community:  ""Off-chain transactions are a divisive concept, obviously. Defeating the purpose of the open ledger aspect to the protocol is a concern.""  Robinson says that at Plug and Play's cafeteria there is a bitcoin-accepting point of sale (POS) system, and he has seen why companies like Coinbase want to run transactions through their own system, off-chain.  Simply, it's faster to use Coinbase-to-Coinbase, for example, than relying on Coinbase-to-block chain. Plus, ""issues arise with miner fees,"" Robinson noted.  Transaction off the block chain do not incur the small amount of BTC that miners are paid for their services in verifying the ledger. Hence, transaction are a little more expensive on-chain.  Robinson believes the issues with transaction speeds on-chain need to be worked out, and suggests doing so with trial-by-fire:  ""I would say I'm in the camp of putting as many transactions on the network as possible and working to solve the micro-transaction latency issue.""  Scaling problems  There is another reason why companies use their own database systems to move bitcoin around: the potential scaling problems that could result as transactions on the bitcoin network increase.  Blocks are only being generated every 10 minutes, which makes confirmation a major issue.  That's why, for larger transactions, bitcoin on-chain makes sense, but less so for smaller payments, which are more often regular and frequent.  The bitcoin network, as it is currently, just cannot support thousands of transactions per second like traditional payment systems. Therefore, there is a strong incentive for companies to go off-block chain instead.  Bitcoin cannot compete with other coins on block generation speed. Litecoin mines blocks every 2.5 minutes, and dogecoin completes a block roughly every 60 seconds.  There are some proposals that could help give bitcoin a speed boost, however.  Perhaps the most intriguing of these would involve a more trustless system by implementing payment channels in a hub-and-spoke design. This is one theoretical way to counter the problems with transaction and block chain size growth.  Catheryne Nicholson, co-founder of BlockCypher, a cloud-based block chain service provider, thinks that bitcoin's infrastructure needs to be performance optimized.  BlockCypher, as a result, is building scalable solutions to help keep the system on-chain, she said, adding:  ""There's no reason for off-blockchain transactions to exist. It undermines the entire block chain.""  Lost advantage  Jesse Powell, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, said that his company uses on-block chain transactions. ""We operate under the presumption that, when you are sending money out, you’re withdrawing. It’s to your own wallet.""  The reasoning behind that is purely for regulatory reasons, he explained. Off-block chain movement of cyrptocurrency, in Kraken's view, has compliance issues:  ""Legally, [off-chain] would be different. It would be money transmission. Coinbase is doing money transmission. So we’re trying to avoid money transmission until we have licences.""  Ortutay, the on-chain micropayment entrepreneur, thinks that some bitcoin companies may have other, less desirable reasons to transact off-block chain:  ""Exchanges use off-chain so they can run a fractional reserve. Certain (unnamed) exchanges/brokers do this because it's hard to operate otherwise.""  Many in the bitcoin community realise that off-chain is quickly increasing in popularity. The problem, however, is that bitcoin stands to lose a portion of one of its key benefits – its decentralized nature.  Ortutay believes that that could, in the end, deliver a blow to bitcoin's early adoption. Bitcoin as a payment mechanism may face a marketing problem when it appears to be doing the same thing its competitors are, he explained, saying:  ""People will correctly question what is so amazing about bitcoin if it is doing the same thing that PayPal or Google Wallet does.""

42425674,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewRh,1400027489,Bittylicious Adds Visa and MasterCard Credit Card Support,"UK-based bitcoin buying and selling service Bittylicious has announced that EU citizens can now use Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards to buy BTC via its platform.  Launched in June 2013, Bittylicious quickly grew in popularity among UK bitcoin users due to the difficulty posed by trading through popular international bitcoin exchanges.  Marc Warne, founder and director of Bittylicious, framed the new service as an extension of Bittylicious' goal of improving the experience of site users, saying:  ""Bittylicious is designed to make the Bitcoin buying process as simple as possible, so we are thrilled to allow users to purchase simply by registering and entering their credit card details.""  With the news, credit and debit card purchases join Bittylicious' growing list of payment options, which also includes bank transfers and mobile payments.  Service limitations  Bittylicious said that, at press time, payments can only be made via credit and debit card in euros, though this functionality extends to cards with other EU currencies or British pounds as the primary currency, provided the user is willing to pay a conversion fee.  Only cards enabled with 3D secure, a feature that allows a cardholder to authenticate themselves when making a payment, will be able to use the service.  Buyers will be limited to purchases of 240 euros per transaction. However, this restriction can be lifted provided buyers submit valid identification documents.  Upgrades forthcoming  Some service limitations will be lifted in the coming weeks, the company says, as it rolls out more features.  Bittylicious says that direct payments in British pounds will be available without fees in the upcoming weeks, though no official timeline for the rollout of this service was given.
