42427066,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJysbh,1472751005,Kimberley Process Inches Closer to 'Blood Diamond' Blockchain,"A new report from the chair of the Kimberley Process – an initiative aimed at keeping conflict diamonds out of the global precious stones market – indicates that the UN-backed scheme is moving forward with its blockchain work.  The internal trials currently underway were first unveiled earlier this year as part of work ongoing in connection with Dubai's Global Blockchain Council – a public-private initiative aimed at encouraging technology innovation.  While the report is light on fresh details – it promises an update several months from now – its publication highlights the continued interest of applying the blockchain to supply chain issues.  The report states:  ""The KP Chair's office is committed to the examination of its benefits and is working on a potential pilot project that would use blockchain technology to monitor KP statistics. An update on the project will be provided at the plenary meeting in November 2016.""  Those involved with the initiative hope to reduce the proliferation of fraudulent Kimberley Process certificates, or documentation that is shipped alongside diamonds attesting to their legitimacy.  But it's a system rife with fraud, and as Motherboard notes, the past decade has seen numerous instances in which fake certificates can fuel diamond sale scams.  The hope, therefore, is that introducing wholly digital certificates backed by an immutable ledger could help alleviate some of these problems. But as of yet, development toward this goal remains in the early stages.  It's a potential application that could alleviate some of the criticism the system has attracted over the years. As The Guardian explained in 2014, certificates are issued for batches of diamonds, not individual stones, which are then subsequently divided, cut and sold.  ""Without a tracking system, this is where the trail ends,"" the publication noted at the time.

42427078,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyszh,1472745549,Ad-Blocking Browser Brave Launches Bitcoin Micropayments,"Web browser developer Brave Software has a new weapon in its arsenal against third-party advertisements.  While the Brave browser has been automatically blocking ads that target users based on their browsing habits since earlier this year, the beta version of Brave Payments, launched today, is the latest move to advance a disruptive business model designed to give users control over their web experience – and the data it creates.  Brave founder and CEO Brendan Eich told CoinDesk how the startup's technology can be used to give users the power to reward websites with content they enjoy and practices they agree with.  Eich said:  ""You can start funding a user wallet that's associated with your anonymous identity with Brave, and automatically micro-pay your top sites.""  To get started, users can either top-up their existing bitcoin wallet, or create one using an integration with Coinbase. Users then set a monthly amount they want to spend, and the browser automatically calculates how to disperse the money to the selected websites based on page impressions.  Using a toggle feature familiar to Apple owners, the interface then lets users select if they don't want to pay some of their most-visited sites. For example, Eich says he's turned off micropayments to subscription sites he already pays for.  Some sites also have been automatically disabled, so users cannot pay them even if they want. Sites that rely on user-generated content such as YouTube and Twitter, for example, cannot currently receive bitcoin.  In the future, however, Eich said he would like to enable micropayments at those sites, giving users the power to pay the content creator instead of the host. In other words, if a Brave user in the future is a fan of a particular YouTube channel, he or she might eventually be able to pay that particular user directly.  ""We’re not going to let our users pay [those sites] because we want to support user-generated content. But we’d like to be able to let users pay the tenant, not the landlord in the future,"" Eich said.  Reception uncertain  When Brave first launched earlier this year, its ad-blocking service received widespread criticism from the publishing industry for what a trade group called ""blatantly illegal"" technology it said would stunt its members' ability to generate revenue on their content.  But at the time, only part of Brave's functionality had been enabled, and it remains unclear whether the publishing industry will continue this course of action against the startup.  Now that the feature is live, Brave is continuing to position the browser as a tool to help news sites and other content creators recoup revenue currently being lost by those already using ad-blocking technology.  In an August interview with CoinDesk about Brave’s $4.5m investment, Eich said that since the initial push-back from publishers he’s engaged with many of them who have begun to view the technology in less aggressive terms.  Eich estimates that someone using that tech could offset those losses by topping-up with $5 worth of bitcoin every month. Until then, Brave plans to continue its work not only contributing to that lost revenue, but giving users an option to pay.  In May of this year, Juniper Research forecast that ad-blocking technology would result $27bn in lost revenue by 2020.  The future of ad-blocking  Ad-blocking technology has gathered increasing support by courts around the world, and appears unlikely to be shut down anytime soon.  Instead of letting that revenue slowly trickle away, Eich said Brave is only at the beginning of creating new ways to offset losses.  Currently, a user's most popular websites are determined by page view, but Eich and his team are exploring new ways to generate that metric. One option is to measure time spent on each site, though more study is required to help ensure that a webpage that is displayed is actually being viewed. He tells CoinDesk Brave will never use eye-tracking technology.  At launch, Brave plans to hold the monthly payments in escrow and send them in bulk to avoid bogging down the bitcoin network, which can only process about seven transactions per second.  But in the future, he said improvements to the bitcoin infrastructure such as the Lightning Network and Segregated Witness could enable micropayments in real-time.  Other changes that could appear in future releases might be additional currencies. In particular, Eich said he's watching the development of Zcash, a soon-to-be launched cryptocurrency that masks both the counterparty identities and the amount being transacted.  The launch of this beta version of the product is intended to help Brave sort through some of the above unknowns as part of the lead-up to the 1.0 version later this year.

42427072,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJysnh,1472737843,Microsoft Launches Smart Contracts Security Working Group,"Microsoft has revealed it is organizing a working group dedicated to improving smart contracts security.  Named 'Kinakuta', the group aims to make it easier for the industry to share information and tips about smart contracts, the term that somewhat loosely has come to refer to self-executing blockchain-based code.  Yet even while incumbents increasingly express interest in the idea blockchains could come to automate complex transactions, concerns about this use case have grown after a vulnerability led to the collapse of the technology's first large-scale implementation, The DAO.  Since then, there has been a growing realization that smart contracts are new and can sometimes be dangerous if used improperly.  However, Microsoft's director of business development and strategy Marley Gray believes open information and new tools might help developers avoid future mistakes.  Gray told CoinDesk:  ""We feel there’s a huge opportunity here to involve the community. Kinakuta is the community building around Microsoft best practices and elsewhere, to collect best practices and tools and involve developers in creating these best practices.""  Together with Andrew Keys, head of global business development at Consensys, Gray said he has drafted a list of 35 developers and companies that Microsoft wants in the group. These include organizations like the Ethereum Foundation, which oversees development of the ethereum blockchain; R3CEV, a banking consortium focused on blockchain; and startup BlockApps.  The formal announcement follows news earlier this month that Microsoft had authored a new white paper with researchers from Harvard that outlines a way to prove whether ethereum smart contracts will work as expected.  Developers can potentially use these resources to spot issues with their code.  ""We wanted to explore the ability to potentially write smart contracts in a language where from the onset your smart contracts would be secure,"" Gray said.  Formal verification  The paper proposes a method of ""formal verification,"" or the process of proving or disproving the correctness of a software program, or in this case, a smart contract.  This paper is one of the latest in a wave of tools trying to make smart contracts safer, such as entirely new programing languages tailored to smart contracts. The white paper proposes two tools to help verify smart contracts in three ways.  The first is Solidity*, which translates a piece of Solidity code to F*, a programming language that verifies whether programs will act as they should. Then there's EVM*, which decompiles the EVM bytecode representation of a smart contract to the Solidity source code.  This second tool is necessary because only 396 out of 112,802 contracts made the Solidity version of the code available on Etherscan at the time of the white paper, so using the bytecode is the next best option.  Despite Solidity*’s current lack of support for complex Solidity features like loops, the team was able to translate 46 out of the 396 contracts written in Solidity. After running these 46 contracts through Solidity*, they found that only a few of these contracts were ""valid"".  ""This is a clear sign that a large scale analysis of published contract is likely to uncover widespread vulnerabilities; we leave such analysis to future work,"" the paper concluded.  However, it's worth noting that while many are excited about the speedy development of tools with a focus on smart contract safety, one industry leader thinks that developers will continue to make mistakes in the near term.  Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin wrote that he doesn't think that these new areas of research will necessarily stop future situations like The DAO.  ""There will be further bugs,"" Buterin said in an ethereum blog post exploring future smart contract security, “and we will learn further lessons.”  Colorful gears via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/09/01/microsoft-launches-smart-contracts-security-working-group,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ad57435fa7227af5055ceb0d5562342d37226a8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427065,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJysZh,1472732874,Visa Incubator to Test Blockchain for Interbank Payments,"Visa’s London-based innovation lab has announced its latest blockchain trial will focus on interbank payments.  Visa Europe Collab  revealed today it has partnered with Toronto-based BTL Group to explore how the startup’s interbank settlement system can leverage blockchain and smart contracts to streamline domestic and cross-border payments between banks.  In statements, Hendrik Kleinsmiede, co-founder of Visa Europe Collab, said the two partners are now inviting European banks to participate in trials that would see them using the emerging technology for live payments to better explore its potential.  Kleinsmiede said:  ""We’ll work closely together on the development and implementation of the PoC, ensuring that all participants come away with new knowledge and insight into the role that the blockchain could play in interbank settlements in the future.”  According to Financial Times, the partners will seek to conclude the project within 100 days.  The trial is the latest that finds Visa Europe Collab exploring blockchain. In July, the firm announced a micropayments trial with bitcoin startup SatoshiPay, a move that followed its initial work on remittances with blockchain firm Epiphyte in 2015.  One of the more novel proofs-of-concept to yet emerge, Visa Europe Collab’s work on this project found it exploring how blockchains could be used to extend the reach of traditional payment networks in developing countries.

42427080,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyt3h,1472730348,Plug and Play's Biggest Blockchain Batch Plans Big Bank Collaborations,"Storied Silicon Valley accelerator Plug and Play recently revealed its biggest batch of blockchain startups yet.  As part of its fourth FinTech class, Plug and Play selected eight blockchain startups, and while the number alone is impressive, two things stand out about its new entrants. The first is a renewed focus on the bitcoin blockchain, and the second is the maturity of the companies, which include recognizable names with market-tested products.  But based on conversations with multiple participants, these ambitious founders are looking for more than mentorships.  If all goes according to plan, the startups selected could take advantage of working with Plug and Play's corporate partners (which include Deloitte, Capital One, Credit Suisse and US Bank) to eventually secure valuable partnerships that could take blockchain mainstream.  To help make that happen, Plug and Play said participants will work with a ""corporate champion"" from each institution who will advise and inform them through their business development.  Vice president of financial technology Scott Robinson told CoinDesk:  ""We think of it as creating task forces on-site.""  Meet the eight blockchain startups joining its latest class:  Nuco  A Toronto-based startup launched in June, Nuco was founded by three former members of Deloitte's blockchain team.  Now employing 11 people, the company is working to create a framework of blockchain-enabled infrastructures for both individual enterprises as well as companies looking to engage in consortia efforts with industry peers.  To begin that process, Nuco is first focusing on a customizable solutions designed to make it easier for blockchain companies to track compliance duties to the SEC and other regulators.  Nuco co-founder Kesem Frank told CoinDesk he sees the presence of major financial institutions as a way to bypass the ""redundancies"" of being introduced to many potential collaborators:  ""Plug and Play represents a remarkable growth opportunity; it is a tremendous professional network that considerably streamlines the conversation between startups and established corporations,"" Frank said.    Tierion       Tierion is working to help clients verify a wide-range of data on the bitcoin blockchain.  Launched last year, the Hartford, Connecticut-based firm won $5,000 at CoinDesk's Consensus 2016 Hackathon, and it has since raised an additional $1m to expand it services from an initial focus on insurance.  Tierion founder Wayne Vaughan cited free office space ""in the heart of Silicon Valley"" among the assets provided by the accelerator.  Like other participants, he views the potential networking with banking partners as pivotal to his work.  Vaughan said:  ""Each week, we're meeting with enterprise customers that we've met through Plug And Play.""  The Sun Exchange  Originally based in the UK, this startup is working to connect solar energy investors around the world with vetted solar energy projects.  The exchange buys solar panels for business operations in South Africa and leases them to locals who want a green source of energy. To meet its goal, The Sun Exchange accepts bitcoin for cross-border payments.  As part of being accepted to Plug and Play, The Sun Exchange relaunched as a US corporation, The Sun Exchange Inc, which has absorbed the previous parent company in the UK and operational arm in South Africa. Newly hired CFO Larry Temlock has relocated to San Francisco to participate in the program.  Though The Sun Exchange’s founder and CEO, Abraham Cambridge tells CoinDesk he’s looking forward the chance to develop business relations and listen to advice from Plug and Play’s financial partners, he added that he’s most excited about what he has to offer them.  Cambridge said:  ""We want to promote to them the benefits of clean energy investing [to] their internal requirements and tailor our offerings to match their criteria.""  The Sun Exchange received its first cash infusion in December of last year when it crowdfunded nearly £16,000 on Indiegogo.  Since then the company was a finalist at the Consensus conference in May, hosted by CoinDesk.  Netki  This Los Angeles-based startup is looking to make bitcoin more consumer-friendly by using identity-based solutions.  Earlier this year, Netki launched a blockchain-based certificate to ensure a website is safe to visit, and in July, it announced it had raised $3.5m from a group of investors, including Plug and Play.  According to Netki CEO Justin Newton, the accelerator is more suitable for mature startups that have already released products.  Newton told CoinDesk:  ""This is the perfect time for us to spend some time at Plug and Play and gain curated access to their corporate partners. We have already been able to begin some great relationships that we believe will lead to increased and accelerated market traction.""  Eximchain  This trade finance startup is building a blockchain-based way to provide letters of credit necessary for small- to medium-sized businesses.  Founded by graduates of MIT, Brown and Northwestern, the team is building a smart-contract based system to let lenders and borrowers negotiate directly with one another.  Once terms are agreed upon the dispersal of the funds would occur automatically. A future version of the platform is described on the company's site as a way to demonstrate creditworthiness and improve the reputation of both traders and lenders.  ShoCard  Another digital identity startup to make the cut is Palo Alto, California-based ShoCard, which uses the bitcoin blockchain to verify identity.  Founded in 2015, ShoCard raised $1.5m in venture capital from AME Cloud Ventures and others shortly after launch.  In May of this year, airline IT company SITA announced that it had partnered with ShoCard to build a proof-of-concept aimed at streamlining how airlines verify passenger identities.  Stellar  Founded in 2014, Stellar is one of the more established startups accepted in the latest accelerator class.  Based in San Francisco, Stellar is seeking to create a distributed payment network that makes it more financially viable for large banks to serve the under-banked.  As of June, Stellar had multiple proofs-of-concept under development with Barclays South Africa and Deloitte, both of which are aimed at delivering financial services to the unbanked and underbanked in Africa.  Tradle  Tradle is building a “metaprotocol” on top of bitcoin’s blockchain to create a layer of trust for non-financial applications.  Beginning with know-your-customer tool 'Trust in Motion', the firm is working to provide a core registration starting in the European Union and around the world.  Tradle won the KPMG FinTech Innovation Challenge earlier this year in the blockchain category.
