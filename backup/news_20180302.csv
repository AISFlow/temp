42428641,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9bBh,1520030735,TechCrunch Founder's Crypto Fund Subpoenaed By SEC,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has reportedly subpoenaed the cryptocurrency investment fund launched last year by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington.  Speaking to CNBC, Arrington confirmed the subpoena, which comes amid what is rumored to be a widening investigation into initial coin offerings (ICOs) by the U.S. securities regulator. It's not entirely clear, however, how wide-reaching the investigation is or when exactly it began.  Still, Arrington's disclosure marks the second public acknowledgment of its kind, coming a day after e-commerce giant Overstock revealed that it had received what it called a ""voluntary"" document request from the SEC in light of a token sale of its own.  ""We received a subpoena. Every [crypto]fund I've talked to has received one,"" Arrington told the network, going on to say:  ""That's fine. They just have to figure out what they want. They need to set up rules so we can all follow them, and the market is begging them for that.""  Arrington announced last November during CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest event in New York that he was raising $100 million for a hedge fund called Arrington XRP Capital.  The comments to CNBC come more than two weeks after a series of now-deleted tweets in which Arrington struck a critical tone regarding the SEC's efforts.  ""I'm not mad I'm terrified. These are blue chip deals with top law firms who checked every box they could think of. And the SEC is going after not just the companies but the investors,"" he wrote in one tweet.  As CoinDesk reported yesterday, the SEC has thus far declined to comment on the scope and nature of the investigation. Sources say that the inquiry stretches back as far as last fall and that as many as 80 subpoenas have been sent out, though other estimates ranged higher than that figure.

42428651,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9bVh,1520026231,$50 Million Gone? South African Police Probe Suspected Bitcoin Ponzi,"As much as $50 million may have been lost by an international group of investors after putting their money into a bitcoin investment group called BTC Global.  A report from South African news outlet Sunday Times indicates that ""more than 27,500 people"" may be impacted, with investors spread across South Africa, Australia and the U.S., among other areas. Some victims have reportedly claimed that they lost as much as $117,000 to the scheme.  A spokesperson for South Africa's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation – popularly known as the Hawks – said the commercial crimes unit is investigating the matter as a potential Ponzi scheme. The spokesperson did note that the group was being investigated for failing to abide by the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act.  Further complicating the situation, individuals in control of the official BTC Global website have posted a statement claiming that the group's funds manager, Steven Twain, had disappeared on February 18.  The message further claims that there has been no contact since that time.  ""Steven did not acknowledge receipt of the information. Steven has not contacted anyone in leadership or admin team,"" the post states. ""No payments have been made by Steven ... If anyone has ANY information on how we can get in contact with him please get in touch and let us know.”  Yet allegations that BTC Global is a Ponzi scheme have been floated in the past, including a February 16 post on Medium by Jessie Holmes which claimed that Steven Twain is not a real person.  The collapse of the investment group has reportedly triggered a series of death threats against those involved. According to the Times, one of the site’s administrators, Cheri Ward, has been granted a protection order against one person who claimed Ward was responsible for the scam.  Additionally, Ward has reportedly filed criminal charges against another person who threatened her.

42394021,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsdlGj,1520020817,Vulnerable? Ethereum's Casper Tech Takes Criticism at Curacao Event,"Is ethereum's biggest future upgrade ""fundamentally vulnerable?""  That was the claim put forward by distributed systems expert and founding VMware researcher Dahlia Malkhi on Friday, who used those exact words to describe ethereum's Casper protocol at Financial Cryptography 2018 in Curacao.  During a keynote presentation, Malkhi's covered blockchain through the lens of a long-studied area of computer science that explores how nodes come to agreement. Still, it was her critical remarks on Casper, an upgrade that has promised to introduce a better, greener algorithm for the ethereum blockchain, that perhaps drew the most notice.  Unlike bitcoin's pioneering proof-of-work system whereby miners expend real electricity and energy to verify blocks of transactions, proof-of-stake offers a kind of virtual mining, where the coins themselves are locked up (like capital in physical miners) and then perform computations.  As such, proponents say proof-of-stake will have the same theoretical benefit to the system, without real-world power costs and environmental issues.  But while the idea's opposition has been just as fierce, Malkhi's comments mark perhaps the first time a renowned computer science researcher has weighed in on the debate.  She told the audience:  ""I think proof-of-stake is fundamentally vulnerable. You're giving authority to a group to call the shots [...] In my opinion, it's giving power to people who have lots of money.  Yet, she softened the blow, adding that she believes Casper has led to ""interesting"" research that's fueled growing interest and innovation in the field of distributed systems.  Learn from history  As someone who's been studying distributed systems for years, Malkhi's biggest concerns stem from the two properties that should be preserved by the technology – safety and liveness.  Within blockchain systems, these attributes help indicate if transactions will go through properly, and if the system itself will move forward with time.  ""I had a conversation with [ethereum's Casper lead author] Vlad Zamfir yesterday,"" Malkhi said. ""He argues, isn't it still useful if it's 'mostly' live?""  In Malkhi's mind, the answer is no, since there are vulnerabilities in how some blockchain projects, such as Casper, are currently laid out.  ""We have several decades of experience here,"" she said.  Her remarks suggest her concern is that not enough traditional academic rigor has been applied to the idea, and that by doing so, key assumptions could be invalidated.  ""Seriously, it's very easy to come up with a solution which is not live. It's trivial. The only thing we need to do in this field is generate mechanisms that are both safe and live,"" she said.  Excitement for the future  That's not to say Malkhi is not excited by cryptocurrency and the new research and innovation it's spawned.  Elsewhere in her talk, she agreed with the often-cited view that bitcoin helps solve a very important problem in distributed systems – the Byzantine Generals Problem – an insight she attributes to notable investors like Marc Andreessen.  Still, she's quick to say the work isn't over yet, calling Andreessen's comment ""insightful"" but also perhaps ""overly optimistic."" As such, her comments suggest she doesn't quite believe any blockchain is architected in way that's free from flaws.  She concluded:  ""The problem is not solved. Yes, we have solid foundations, but these foundations break in surprising ways especially when you try to break them and innovate.

""The Foundation is providing increased resources and support to expand the core development team of Tezos in Paris,"" the Foundation explained.

Days later, the Tezos Foundation board expanded to include Polychain founder Olaf Carlson-Wee, Alstom Digital Mobility senior vice president Pascal Cléré, Valais Academic Association co-president Marylène Micheloud and venture capitalist Hubertus Thonhauser.  The hiring push is perhaps indicative of the change of pace following the resolution of a months-long governance dispute that roiled the Tezos project, pitting founders Arthur and Kathleen Breitman against Gevers.

Cardtronics noted the potential impact of cryptocurrencies on its business prospects in its most recent 10-K annual report to shareholders filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The tech was mentioned alongside other digital payment methods, including apps like Venmo, that would reduce the need for people to carry cash.  The company said in the filing, which was published on March 1:  ""New payment technology, such as Venmo, Zelle, and virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, or other new payment method preferences by consumers could reduce the general population’s need or demand for cash and negatively impact our transaction volumes in the future.""  ""Changes in consumer preferences and usage behavior"" could ultimately lead to reduced cash flows, the company continued.  Cardtronics joins a list of U.S. financial companies, namely banks, that have sounded the alarm in this manner in recent days. That list includes Square, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, as well as smaller regional banks like WesBanco and IberiaBank.  Yet whether cryptocurrencies themselves will affect the use of ATMs remains to be seen, since cash is already fading away as a payment method in many countries. Research published in December by Australia's central bank notes declining ATM withdrawal rates despite a growing number of actual machines in use.  Other companies have warned about how the shifting fortunes of cryptocurrency markets could impact them in the long term, including graphics card maker AMD, which has seen demand grow thanks to the need for chips as part of the mining process. AMD noted that volatility in the cryptocurrency markets could have an impact on its GPU sales.

While bitcoin ended February with marginal gains, and the likes of litecoin and lesser-known DigixDao shined, names like ICON (ICX), NEM (XEM) and cardano (ADA) took a beating as the market turned south, CoinDesk data shows.  In fact, a majority of the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization suffered losses.  Quite clearly, these tokens may have been struggling to win back traders, a fact made clear by the broad-based crypto market recovery from Feb. 6 lows, which appears to have encouraged the crypto faithful to reinvest (even if the retail market has been scared off).  ICON  While ICON aims to create a network of blockchain communities that can freely interact, its markets could have arguably used more interaction in February.  The blockchain's ICX token fell 53.78 percent in February and declined Friday to a two-month low of BTC 0.0003280 on exchange provider Binance. The ICX token rose to a record high of BTC 0.0009194 ($10.08) on Jan.30, possibly due to surge in investor interest ahead of ICON team's first annual summit (held on Jan. 31).  Still, the broad-based crypto market sell-off pushed ICX to a low of $2.40 on Feb 6, and in the subsequent days, the token failed to regain poise.  Its bitcoin exchange rate is now well below the low of BTC 0.0003911 seen on Feb. 6.  NEM  NEM's XEM token has retraced close to 80 percent of the record rally it saw from July to January. Prices dipped below $0.40 on Feb. 6 and were seen trading around the same level at the end of the last month, according to CoinMarketCap.  Though, those who have been following the news might not be shocked.  The token was involved in a huge cryptocurrency heist in January, when hackers stole around $530 million worth of the digital asset from Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck.  Also, rumors have been doing the rounds that NEM will serve as an underlying platform for Venezuela's PTR (Petro cryptocurrency). It is widely believed that will be a game changer for NEM, but so far, Venezuela's decision to put its faith in NEM has not been able to put a floor under XEM.  Cardano  Cardano, designed to provide a new decentralized economy and to democratize financial markets in emerging markets, has seen solid gains since launch last year, winning favor with traders and developers. (It's now ranked second as per Github activity.)  Such a meteoric rise has bolstered comments from its team, with founder Charles Hoskinson (ethereum's former ""CEO"") proclaiming the platform will someday outperform both bitcoin and ethereum. However, price action suggests otherwise.  The cryptocurrency fell 39.81 percent in February, and was last seen trading at $0.28 on Binance. The daily chart shows ADA has created a large head and shoulders bearish reversal pattern with neckline support at $0.24.  A daily close below $0.24 will confirm a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend reversal and open doors for a drop to $0.10.

During a speech at the Scottish Economics Conference in Edinburgh on Friday, Mark Carney, governor of Bank of England, said he thinks more rigorous regulations should be applied to exchanges in an effort to curb illicit use of cryptocurrencies in financial crimes, such as money laundering and terrorism financing.  “In my view, holding crypto-asset exchanges to the same rigorous standards as those that trade securities would address a major underlap in the regulatory approach,"" Carney said.  Further, the central bank chief said he doesn't believe cryptocurrencies currently pose significant risks to the existing financial system. However, such risks may grow as retail adoption of bitcoin expands and traditional institutions lag behind on improvements to their systems.  In other comments, Carney said that he believes cryptocurrency is ""failing"" as a type of money. It acts ""at best, only for some people and to a limited extent, and even then only in parallel with the traditional currencies of the users,"" he said.  The central bank chief added that he is not against the innovation provided by cryptocurrencies, however, and argued that regulation would be of benefit to the industry, as well as consumers.  ""Their core technology is already having an impact. Bringing crypto-assets into the regulatory tent could potentially catalyse innovations to serve the public better,"" he said.  The comments come soon after a warning from the country's top financial regulator on the risks of cryptocurrency investment.  As reported in December, Andrew Bailey, the chief of the Financial Conduct Authority, warned domestic investors that cryptocurrency assets like bitcoin are not regulated in the U.K. and, as such, any investment loss may not be protected.

42428656,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9bdh,1519995657,Ethereum's Raiden Network Has New Scaling Competiton,"Yet another ethereum scaling solution is launching a test network.  Announced Friday, Liquidity.Network is officially joining Raiden Network as the latest ethereum project to attempt to move transactions off the world's second most valuable blockchain and into payment channels, in turn, allowing the network to support greater adoption and use.  Similar to bitcoin's better-known Lightning Network, Liquidity.Network aims to enable ethereum users to transact back and forth, without having to pay the cost of moving coins on the blockchain itself. In short, users pay to start channels and to close channels, not for what happens in between.  But while Raiden is the furthest along in its development of the concept, it's still yet to go live, and with ethereum nearing capacity at times, today's news that another team is working on the challenge marks what many will likely see as welcome competition.  Notably, the solution makes use of Revive, an early-stage technology pioneered last year that claims to offer a better, less expensive way of setting up off-chain transactions.  Liquidity.Network co-founder and Imperial College London assistant professor Arthur Gervais told CoinDesk:  ""What we're providing is a payment hub which allows you to do bi-directional payments among however many people you want, which we think could be big for ethereum in general.""  According to Gervais, what's available for use on ethereum's Ropsten testnet today is an unfinished alpha version, one that he hopes will attract early testers. Like Raiden, Liquidity.Network will also issue a token to fund development and power the protocol, though it's currently in pre-sale and isn't yet necessary for the network.  Key innovations  While the launch lays the groundwork for a new off-chain payment network, Liquidity.Network is also introducing what is perhaps the first test wallet on ethereum that can send and receive these kinds of transactions.  According to Gervais, the wallet isn't made for real ether – at least, not yet – but for sending and receiving dummy coins on the test network.  Still, what Gervais was most excited about was the ""hub"" that connects different users on the network under the hood so they can transact back-and-forth.  Since the hub pools everyone's money together in a unique way, it's supposed to offer more flexibility for sending payments to disparate people across the network.  According to Gervais, this is Liquidity.Network's key technical innovation that distinguishes it from other scaling projects.  High hopes  On top of that, the network's founders are now looking beyond Liquidity.Network's possible use on ethereum, seeking to build more complex applications on top.  After they finish making it compatible with the larger ethereum network, for example, they hope to add support for ERC-20, the standard used to create crypto tokens launched via initial coin offerings (ICOs), in an effort to increase the scalability of those networks as well.  As such, the launch signals that more interest is being paid to ethereum's growing adoption and the usability issues those new users face. Indeed, Gervais hopes that adding another scaling project to ethereum will help speed up the time it takes for more projects to come to fruition.  That's one reason why Gervais is pushing for Liquidity.Network to go live on the ethereum blockchain as soon as possible.  He concluded:  ""It will be ready for mainnet in three months. We're pushing hard to make it ready.""

According to Reuters, the bill was passed by Mexico's Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of its legislature, on Thursday and currently is pending signature from Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto before it goes into effect as law.  The latest legislative move follows a previous green light from the country's Senate in December 2017 that cleared the way for the bill, which is aimed to bring certainty on the status of cryptocurrency, as well as to prevent use of the tech in illicit activities such as money-laundering.  As reported by CoinDesk, the framework aims to set out that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Mexico, a stance in line with comments from the country's central bank in early 2017. In a local report, Agustin Carstens, the then-governor of Banco de Mexico said bitcoin should be considered a commodity, not a currency.  In addition, the bill also seeks to put the operation of cryptocurrency exchanges under oversight of the country's central bank.  The Reuters report, though, indicates that the bill, drafted in general terms, will also see further development of a secondary law by other financial regulators such as Mexico's securities commission, the central bank and the finance ministry in the coming months.  The changes are expected to bring rules on activities such as fund-raising by cryptocurrency firms.

As of writing, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) had dropped slightly to $10,890 – up around 19 percent from the weekly low of $9,304.68, and 5 percent over the last 24 hours.  A look the individual markets on data site CoinMarketCap shows trading volume is highest in BTC/USDT (bitcoin-tether) pair listed on the cryptocurrency exchange OKEx. Further, three out of the top 10 exchanges by volume offer BTC/USDT. So, it appears investors are using tethers to trade bitcoin – perhaps due to the USD-pegged token's low volatility.  Meanwhile, 24-hour trading volume stands at $8.4 billion – the highest since Feb. 21. However, that number doesn't look particularly impressive when compared to the average daily trading volume of $13.4 billion seen in January and $13.2 billion seen around the price peak in December. Further, the 24-hour volume is largely unchanged from the February average daily volume of $8.25 billion.  While stagnant volumes are a cause for concern, the odds of a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders breakout have improved, price chart analysis indicates.

Daily chart (log scale): Trendline resistance intact, BTC falls back below $11,000  On the above chart (prices as per Bitfinex), the descending trendline resistance shifts higher to around $11,600 due to the log price scale.  Since BTC has moved by a large percentage over the last year, log price scale is preferable as it plots two equal percent changes as the same vertical distance. So, regardless of where we are on the graph (at $2,000 or $20,000), a significant percentage move will always correspond to a significant visual change.  That said, a significant majority of investors use the linear scale and hence, it could be said that an upside break of the descending trendline occurred earlier this week.  Further, the bullish 5-day MA (moving average) and 10-day MA cross on this chart also favor the bulls, as does yesterday's close (as per UTC) above the 50-day moving average (MA). And, last but not least, the relative strength index (RSI) has moved higher, indicating scope for an upside move in BTC prices.  However, yesterday's price gains were not backed by strong volumes and the retreat from the intraday high of $11,189 to $10,900 seen today has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook.  View  A high volume break above $11,610 (inverse head-and-shoulders breakout) would open the doors for a rally to $17,000–$17,400.  Meanwhile, a drop below the descending trendline support of $10,000 (on the linear chart) would signal bullish invalidation.  Bearish scenario: As discussed yesterday, a daily close below $9,280.4 (Feb. 25 low) could yield a sell-off to $6,500-$6,000.

42380379,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NUlN,1519981538,"'Bitcoin Private' Is Here, But What's It Worth?","A fork of a fork of a fork?  With Friday's birth of a new coin called ""bitcoin private,"" the cryptocurrency space just keeps getting more meta. The much-discussed launch finds the cryptocurrency being created from a copy of the zclassic cryptocurrency (itself a copy of zcash, which was a copy of bitcoin).  But if that sounds crazy, it's all – allegedly – in the spirit of innovation.  ""The big experiment with airdropped coins was that they’ll just fail, and if people are getting free coins, they'll just immediately sell them and it will dump down to pennies,"" said Rhett Creighton, who's leading the bitcoin private effort.  Yet, in a number of cases, that notion just didn't pan out.  Bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold and ethereum classic, three high-profile hard forks, are now valued at $1,285, $115 and $34, respectively. And for those who owned large amounts of bitcoin or ether, those launches meant big gains with little effort.  But for zclassic, its fork wasn't exactly a success story. Zclassic flatlined throughout most of 2017, falling to under $2 per coin, while zcash stayed in the hundreds.  Rather than walk away, though, in December, Creighton doubled down.  “I would like to propose revitalizing zclassic by migrating it to become a bitcoin hard fork, 'Bitcoin Private' (or possibly another name),"" Creighton tweeted.  And although Creighton told members of a Telegram channel he didn't write any of the code or create the white paper, logo or website, his concept has come to life.  In this way, bitcoin private is perhaps the pinnacle of the forking phenomenon, and in turn, it has become somewhat of a punching bag for crypto enthusiasts on Twitter. Trader Peter McCormack dismissed it as “brand stealing” and “unnecessary,” while a popular Twitter user @dandarkpill called the project “an abominable potpourri of buzzword features.”  Yet, the cryptocurrency has garnered a significant amount of interest, for distributing new, free coins to users of, not just one existing blockchain, but two: zclassic and bitcoin.  By forking a code base, a user's private key can be made to access multiple wallets, a method that, while criticized on security grounds, Creighton sees as a feature that could become important over time.  He told CoinDesk:  “So you have in the case of bitcoin, all these people have their private keys, but when forks spring up now the same private key can be used in different peer-to-peer networks. It seems to be a key piece to the technology.”  The founder's fee  But is this really innovative? As Creighton puts it, ""No one has ever done a fork like this.""  And he's right – the value proposition and mechanisms at work might be perhaps the strangest and most complex yet of any fork.  Specifically, what bitcoin private is implementing – or, rather, reinstating – is similar to zcash's ""founder's fee,"" a line of code that allocates 20 percent of the cryptocurrency generated by mining to the zcash development team.  Removing the zcash founder's fee was the core value proposition of zclassic (which bitcoin private is forking from). But what shook out was a cryptocurrency that failed to keep pace, its wallet causing so many problems it was shut down by exchange Bittrex recently.  According to the bitcoin private white paper, this was due to a lack of developer funding:  ""Zclassic suffered from the same ideas which it derived its greatness: the absence of a founder’s tax led to a lack of active development.”  So, bitcoin private reintroduces a type of founders' fee. Prior to the launch of bitcoin private, zclassic miners were asked to contribute computing power to the zclassic protocol in exchange for new private bitcoins, and to put the old coins into a pool that will fund development of the new protocol. (The old zclassic chain will keep on running in parallel.)  The white paper stresses this program was voluntary. Otherwise, bitcoin private looks nearly identical to zcash.  “We wanted to create the fork in a short period of time, I think that we didn’t feel like we had enough time to really consider the best options,"" he said, stressing that updates would soon be forthcoming.  Why not use zcash?  Yet to many, bitcoin private, in that it's a basic carbon copy of zcash, is just another cash grab. Indeed, for a handful of investors, it definitely seems that way already.  Following the announcement of the fork, zclassic's price shot up, peaking at $199.26, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Then, shortly following the so-called snapshot on February 28, zclassic sank from $122 to $24.  This is notable, as a snapshot is a process whereby developers create a type of freeze-frame of the blockchain they're forking – in this case, both zclassic and bitcoin – replicating the data and then diverging from there. The snapshot allows the new coins to be airdropped to wallets on the connecting blockchains at equivalent rates.  In response to those price movements, crypto investor and entrepreneur Richard Heart tweeted, ""Have you heard of a pump and dump before?""  And ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin even displayed some confusion, if not disapproval, after a Twitter user linking Buterin's praise of zk-snarks privacy technology to bitcoin private, tweeting in reply, ""Why not just use zcash?""  Plus, a number of crypto enthusiasts have become irate at the rate of hard forks, using only slight variations of long-established cryptocurrencies' names, which many think are confusing the industry and exacerbating scams. Charlie Lee, the creator of litecoin, for instance, voiced his concerns recently over a litecoin hard fork that's using the name litecoin cash.  Yet, Creighton remains suspiciously optimistic.  “We’re going to be tapping into all of the people that are key holders of bitcoin, so we’re tapping into that network, and what we’re giving those people is zk-snarks privacy, plus the same decentralized mining as bitcoin gold, plus faster block times and larger blocks,"" he said.  Finally, he pointed to a typical refrain of crypto enthusiasts:  ""People decide how they’re going to value that.""

In an application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on Thursday, Walmart describes a ""smart package"" that would include a device which would record information on a blockchain regarding the contents of the package, its environmental conditions, its location and more. It also suggests that its smart package could be used in tandem with other emerging technologies including ""autonomous vehicles,"" such as drones.  The patent was first submitted in August of 2017, and notably builds on a filing Walmart submitted for a blockchain-based drone package delivery tracking system last year.  Walmart explains in the filing that online shopping has created shipping challenges for retailers, particularly with regard to perishable products requiring temperature control, thus necessitating further innovation.  Walmart writes in the application:  ""These online customers many times seek to purchase items that may require a controlled environment and further seek to have greater security in the shipping packaging that the items are shipped in.""  The application states that the blockchain component will be encrypted into the device, and will have ""key addresses along the chain of [the package's] custody, including hashing with a seller private key address, a courier private key address and a buyer private key address.""  In addition to its delivery drone aspirations, Walmart has sought to apply blockchain technology to other areas of its business.  Last year, it joined Kroger, Nestle and other food industry firms in a partnership with IBM to use the blockchain to improve food traceability.

42380387,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NUxx,1519959642,Louisiana Officials Probe Staffers for Bitcoin Mining,"The attorney general of the U.S. state of Louisiana is reportedly investigating a group of former staffers for using official resources to mine cryptocurrencies.  According to a report from the Tribune News Service, officials in Louisiana have yet to publicly comment on the rumored investigation. Yet sources told the publication that the Louisiana Bureau of Investigation began asking questions after discovering ""hardware that they believed could have been used in the so-called mining of bitcoin.""  ""We were worried that the (computer) systems may have been compromised,"" one source told the news outlet. Some of the employees, whose names were not published, have reportedly denied that they engaged in the energy-intensive mining process, through which new coins are minted.  If confirmed, the investigation would be the latest to emerge in recent years regarding the suspected use of public-office resources to mine cryptocurrencies.  In January 2017, for example, Federal Reserve's Office of the Inspector General fined a former staffer $5,000 after being caught mining bitcoins on a server owned by the U.S. central bank between 2012 and 2014. Later that year, New York's Department of Education sanctioned an employee for mining bitcoins on their work computer between March and April 2014.
