In a Brief History of The Internet, internetsociety.org notes that &apos;The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing before.&apos; If crypto is the next revolution and many industries are already jumping in (finance, music, fashion, gaming, social media, etc), what will our world and portfolios look like once mass adoption happens?

Crypto Technology A Wells Fargo Investment Institute report has compared how users started to embrace the internet in 1990 with the current cryptocurrency adoption rates. The investment adviser suggests that both internet and crypto adoption started at a slow pace, but as the former &apos;hit an inflection point, and then steeply accelerated&apos;, the following years could show a similar spike for the crypto industry. The report notes that in the cases of several technologies, &apos;decades passed between the actual inventions and surging adoption rates.&apos; Only 1% of the world population and 14% of Americans were using the internet by 1995 even though it was i...",POSITIVE,없음,TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-crypto-is-following-the-1990-internet-adoption-curve/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42375336,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7HR9,1644363319,Judge Stops Release of Bitfinex Hack Laundering Suspects,"A federal judge has halted the release of two individuals suspected of laundering proceeds from the 2016 Bitfinex hack.  Chief Judge Beryl Howell, of the U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C., stayed an earlier order by a New York magistrate judge to release Ilya ""Dutch"" Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan on bail. The two were arrested Tuesday by federal officials on charges stemming from a 2016 hack of the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange. The U.S. Department of Justice also said officials seized 94,000 BTC, worth over $3.5 billion at today's prices.  Inner City Press first reported the news late Tuesday. Howell's order will delay the couple's release at least until her court can review the initial order.  Prosecutors sought pretrial detention during the hearing this afternoon, arguing the pair might be a flight risk. Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman of the Southern District of New York sentenced Lichtenstein to home detention with a wearable GPS and a $5 million bond, while Morgan got the same with a $3 million bond.  The parents of both defendants were required, as a condition of the bond, to pledge their homes as collateral. The couple will spend at least Tuesday night in jail, pending an investigation by pretrial services officers.  The government initially asked for a $100 million bond, which was quickly rejected. The defense countered with $1 million, which was also rejected.  Lichtenstein must obtain signatures on his bond from five people, the judge ordered. Morgan was required to get two, which her parents agreed to provide.  Defense attorneys told the court that Morgan has health problems (including recent breast surgery) and that incarceration would be dangerous for her. She gets migraine headaches when exposed to bright lights and had to go to the hospital Tuesday after her arrest at around 7 a.m. Eastern time, her attorneys said.  According to a criminal complaint attached to the Department of Justice's press release, the two are both being charged with money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States. They aren't being charged with conducting the hack itself.  Read more: US Officials Seize $3.6B in Bitcoin From 2016 Bitfinex Hack  An attached statement of facts further alleged that Lichtenstein and Morgan had control of a crypto wallet that held the proceeds from the 2016 hack, as well as numerous other addresses. All told, the two were allegedly in control of 2,000 different addresses and their corresponding seed phrases, which were recorded on a spreadsheet saved to a cloud storage service used by Lichtenstein.  According to Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute, the first charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, no more than twice the value of the property involved or both, while the second charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison or a fine, or both.  Depending on how the case proceeds, prosecutors can seek a lighter sentence or a judge can choose to impose a below-maximum sentence. Tuesday’s hearing was intended to determine whether the defendants would be held in pretrial detention.  Defense attorneys said the defendants have “been aware” of the investigation since at least this past November after one of their service providers received a subpoena, but had not fled ahead of their arrest. That was the reason the judge said she granted bail.  Prosecutors said during the hearing that the defendants had a file on their computer titled ""passport_ideas.txt” with information about obtaining passports through darknet markets.

It's clear that the defendants have means, have traveled, and that the charges are serious. I'm troubled by the cloud-based account about passports,” Freeman said during the hearing.  One of the defense attorneys said the file was meant to open financial accounts, rather than to facilitate a flight to safety.  A plastic bag full of cellphones, labeled ""burner phones,"" was found under the couple's bed, prosecutors said in court.  As a condition of their bond, the defendants are allowed to spend up to $10,000 a month on living expenses but they are forbidden to drain their bank accounts or make any cryptocurrency transactions, the judge said.  Another condition: The couple's cellphones and computers will be confiscated and they will be given a flip phone and one internet-connected device, monitored by pretrial services, so that they can access their bank accounts and email their lawyers.

42375340,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7HZx,1644362803,First Mover Asia: Crypto Prices Finish Largely in the Red,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin drops, while Bitfinex’s LEO pumps on the latest development of the 2016 hack.  Technician's take: Overbought signals on intraday charts preceded the current BTC pullback. Lower support nearby into the Asia trading day.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $44,187 +.06%  Ether (ETH): $3,134 -0.3%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector XRP XRP +20.7% Currency Polygon MATIC +16.4% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum Classic ETC +9.3% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  ""There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.""

U.S. officials announced they had seized roughly $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin tied to the exchange’s 2016 hack.  At the time of publication, the oldest cryptocurrency was trading at $44,187, roughly where it was 24 hours ago, according to CoinDesk data.  Bitcoin fell on Wednesday after it went as high as $45,519.24 during Asia trading hours, based on data from TradingView and Coinbase. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down slightly over the past 24 hours to just over $3,132, according to CoinDesk data.  Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that after a relatively quiet week, bitcoin’s trading volume across major exchanges has increased gradually this week.  The market chatter on Tuesday, however, centered on the potential impact of the latest development around Bitfinex’s hack in 2016. As CoinDesk reported, the U.S. Department of Justice announced on Tuesday that it had seized some $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin tied to the breach. The number marks the largest financial seizure in history by U.S. law enforcement, according to the release.  UNUS SED LEO token (LEO), the utility token intended to be used on Bitfinex and other trading platforms managed by its parent company iFinex, rose 40% in just 20 minutes after the news broke.  Bitfinex said it would buy back and burn any outstanding LEO if it recovers the stolen bitcoin within 18 months of the day of receiving this bitcoin.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Stalls Near Resistance; Lower Support at $40K  Bitcoin (BTC) reached a high of $45,488 over the past 24 hours, near a key resistance zone that preceded the current pullback. The cryptocurrency could find lower support at $40,000 into the Asia trading day.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is declining from overbought territory, similar to what occurred in late December amid a short-term downtrend. This time, however, bitcoin has broken above previous resistance levels, which means the current pullback could stabilize soon.  One concern is the low conviction among buyers, evidenced by low trading volume during the prior price rally. Low volume rallies typically result in pullbacks or range-bound trading before a more definitive price bottom is confirmed.

The cryptocurrency had managed to grow from about $0.20 at the beginning of 2021 to a high of $3, which saw investors cashing out massive gains. However, the trip down would prove to be just as swift and impactful as the trip up. ADA has since lost about 60% of its all-time high value, falling below $1 for the first time in eight months. Since the digital asset has spent such a long time in a downtrend, there looks to be nowhere to go but up as ADA plots its move upwards after forming a local resistance point.

On Monday, the publicly traded crypto firm registered “​​Coinbase Innovation PAC” with the Federal Election Commission, sending a strong signal of its desire to sway federal officials during the 2022 midterm election cycle. The crypto exchange is hardly alone: Industry heavyweights formed their own pro-crypto PAC late last month.  Politico first reported the Coinbase filing.  The growing number of crypto PACs speaks to an industry hungry for political influence. Shaken by last year’s messy (and unresolved) crypto tax debate, firms such as Coinbase ran up their largest-ever lobbying bills in an effort to hold the line. Coinbase spent $740,000 lobbying the Senate during the fourth quarter.  Forming a PAC could shift Coinbase’s horse-trading further down the food chain, to candidates for office.  Filings indicate that Coinbase’s PAC and its lobbying effort are closely aligned. Head of U.S. Policy Kara Calvert is listed as a contact on the form. She took that job in November after lobbying for Coinbase as a partner at Franklin Square Group.  Coinbase formed a PAC in 2018 but quickly scuttled the effort with nothing to show for it.  “​​Coinbase is committed to engaging with policymakers and to promote crypto-forward policy at the federal level in the U.S.,” a Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk via email. “​​We believe the bipartisan potential is clear and we intend to support crypto-forward lawmakers who align with our mission to advance economic freedom for all Americans.”  Calvert did not respond to CoinDesk emails.

42394310,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbR7v,1644358434,Terra Wants to Spend $40M on a Mystery Sports Deal. We Think It’s With This MLB Team,"The Terra ecosystem has a mystery on its hands: Which professional sports team will be the recipient of nearly $40 million in crypto sponsorships?  I don’t have the answer, but I think I’ve formulated the next best thing. Come with me down the rabbit hole to see what I see. Because I’m pretty sure I know who it is.  Our whodunit begins late Jan. 31 with a tweet from Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs and a key steward of a blockchain that now holds $12.5 billion in locked assets. He’s got a juicy pitch for his LUNAtics, as the network’s faithful go by: LUNA token holders will get to vote on greenlighting a professional U.S. sports sponsorship. A big one, too: 40 million UST.  That’s the price – denominated in the network’s dollar-pegged, algorithmic stablecoin – that LUNAtics must “yea” to emblazon their name on this “legendary” franchise’s finest stadium club for five glorious years.  But there’s a catch: Kwon says he can’t reveal which team it is. Lawyers won’t let him, he explains.  Alas, there’s no way around it. Terra’s voters must approve the WHAT to find out the WHO. And there’s plenty of WHAT to go around. Kwon’s community proposal describes every inch of the planned Terra sponsorship, right down to the pixel count on closed-circuit television ads (400x850).  If token holders were bothered by the informational disconnect they haven’t shown it. Over 98% of participating token allotments were in favor of moving forward with about four hours left on the clock.  Ignoring uncomfortable questions this opaque setup prompts – about decentralized governance, power imbalances, rubber-stamping, vote gamification – Kwon’s proposal presents an opportunity for enterprising internet sleuths.  And so I set out to crack the code.  Let’s begin with the sample size. Kwon’s proposal mentions North America’s four big sports leagues: Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Football League (NFL), the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). In all, we have 124 teams at play but fewer stadiums, given common venue-sharing arrangements between basketball and hockey teams. But I think we can narrow it down to MLB alone.  Why? Consider Kwon’s community proposal:  “The Club is also ideally situated on national TV broadcasts. It will introduce the Terra brand and provide exposure of our ethos to a diverse and expansive group of people who enjoy watching the team and sport on both TV and in-person. In particular, it grants Terra exposure to a national audience that may not have any other avenues for brand exposure to Terra.”  Baseball fits better than any other league. Only in baseball do broadcasters regularly capture off-field action because only in baseball do the cameras return to one point: home plate.  Many baseball franchises position their VIP lounges directly behind home plate. It’s the best place to view each pitch from the stands, commanding high ticket prices from well-connected fans looking for amenities the nosebleeds simply can’t offer. It’s also the only seating area that television viewers regularly see in a game broadcast.  “Ideal,” you might say.  The sample size is now 32.  We could choose to unpack Kwon’s linguistic minutiae for clues that narrow the field. For example, I’d only call a handful of franchises “household names;” the label “legendary” applies to fewer still.  I don’t need to rule out the Miami Marlins. That hapless franchise rules itself out of the National League East just fine. You can’t say the same about their division rivals, the Nationals.  Though “legendary” may be a stretch, the Nationals, winners of the 2019 World Series, are my guess for the Terra proposal.  Their ballpark fits the bill. Here’s a run-down of my digital evidence:  From the proposal:  “Terra brand placement on 5 massive, rotating LED boards hosted on the exterior of the Venue”  From my research:  The Nationals (controversially) moved to install five massive LED billboards in 2017.  From the proposal:  “In addition, this consists of an LED Fascia Ribbon display of the Terra brand across 580 feet of LEDs inside the Venue.”  From my research:  Nationals Ballpark boasts “over 600 feet” of LED Fascia Ribbon.  From the proposal:  “67% of Club Season Plan holders have an individual income greater than $125K.” “42% of Club Season Plan holders hold a postgraduate degree.”  From my research:  Only two MLB teams use the phrase “season plan holders” to describe what most would call a “season ticket holder.” They’re the Nationals and the Orioles.

42375343,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7HbD,1644356166,Market Wrap: Cryptocurrencies Pull Back in Light Trading,"Most cryptocurrencies traded lower on Tuesday, a reminder that the surge earlier this week may be temporary.  There were reminders of other weaknesses in the crypto markets when the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it has seized $3.6 billion worth of BTC tied to the 2016 hack of Bitfinex, a large crypto exchange registered in the British Virgin Islands.  The hack resulted in 120,000 stolen BTC, worth around $60 million at the time of the theft. A married couple was arrested in New York on Tuesday on charges they conspired to launder proceeds from the hack.  Bitfinex said it will repay investors in its UNUS SED LEO token, which quickly rallied as much as 50% against the U.S. dollar in just one hour after the news broke. CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De and Danny Nelson reported on the event here.  Meanwhile, bitcoin and ether each declined 3% in the past 24 hours, compared with a 7% dip in Solana's SOL token over the same period. XRP stood out with a 3% gain on Tuesday.  Despite improving sentiment among traders, some analysts expect choppy price action over the short term.  ""Trading volume has been light. So far, BTC has held up the $30K-$40k support level that we witnessed last year but we aren't out of the woods yet,"" Martha Reyes, head of research at Bequant, a digital asset brokerage platform and exchange, stated in an email to CoinDesk.  ""And when it comes to macro risks, especially as volume has been light in equities, with high volatility, some cracks are beginning to show in high-yield credit,"" Reyes added.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $44001, −0.45%    ●Ether (ETH): $3108, −1.51%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4522, +0.84%    ●Gold: $1828 per troy ounce, +0.40%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 1.95%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Sentiment improves  The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index exited ""extreme fear"" territory last week and it now signals improving sentiment.  ""After spending almost three months in a state of fear and misery, the more comfortable 'Greed' area should be highly welcomed by tired [bitcoin traders],"" Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday report.  The last time the index rose from extreme lows was in July, which preceded a price rally. This time, however, the rise in BTC occurred on low trading volume, which indicates weak buying power. That could point to a short-term pullback or range-bound price action, especially as regulatory and macroeconomic headwinds remain.  ""Towards the downside, $40,000 is the most important support level to pay attention to in the coming days,"" Arcane wrote.  Bitcoin rises versus ether  The chart below shows the recent pullback in ether relative to bitcoin, or the ETH/BTC price ratio. Over the past week, during the crypto rally, ETH's return has trailed BTC by about 1%. Despite the small return gap, technical breakdowns in ETH/BTC suggest relative weakness could persist over the short term.

Axie Infinity reduces SLP emissions: In the Axie Infinity video game, players earn ""smooth love potion"" (SLP) tokens as rewards, which can then be redeemed for in-game features. Unlike AXS – a governance token that allows holders to participate in decisions for Axie Infinity’s future – SLP has an uncapped token supply, meaning there is no limit to how many SLP tokens could exist in the future. Axie Infinity has now introduced important changes to the rewards system, reducing the daily SLP token supply by 56%, endeavoring to make it a more sustainable product for users. Read more here.

Rather, the feds said, “In or around August 2016, a hacker breached Victim [virtual currency exchange’s] security systems and infiltrated its infrastructure.”  That leaves the door open for others to be charged with that or for more definitive statements to come out later.  Read more: US Officials Seize $3.6B in Bitcoin From 2016 Bitfinex Hack  ‘Genghis Khan’ and the privacy champion  A University of California, Davis grad, Morgan spent time in the Middle East, getting a Master of Arts degree in international economic development at the American University in Cairo and studying Turkish monetary policy in Ankara’s Bilkent University, according to what appears to be her LinkedIn profile. (She calls herself “Turkish Martha Stewart” in a music video.)  At 23 she built a company called SalesFolk, which uses a stable of copywriters to pump out cold emails for companies wanting to market their wares on the internet.  “I’m going to tell you my secret for making dreams a reality,” Morgan said in a TikTok video. “I started my company when I was 23 and grew it into a multimillion-dollar business with zero outside funding. I had no connections. I didn’t go to an Ivy League school and I wasn’t trust-funded. How did I do it? I learned a simple framework in Silicon Valley from some top entrepreneurs that are now billionaires that I live by. It goes like this: automate, eliminate, delegate.”  She counts self-proclaimed “crypto genius” James Altucher and Indiegogo founder Slava Rubin as LinkedIn connections, as well as a few CoinDesk alumni.  A Forbes contributor, she wrote an article titled, “Experts Share Tips To Protect Your Business From Cybercriminals” and regularly wrote for the likes of Inc. Magazine.  Interestingly, one piece she did for Forbes included quotes from BitGo's chief compliance officer, Matt Parrella. BitGo provided the multi-signature wallets and was custodian for Bitfinex at the time of the nearly 120,000 bitcoin hack in 2016. ""In order to withdraw such a large amount of funds, BitGo would likely have had to sign off on those transactions,"" Stan Higgins wrote at the time for CoinDesk.  Oh, and she is a rap star. OK, not quite like fellow entrepreneur Jay-Z or even Vanilla Ice, but her humorous takes were mildly reminiscent of Kitty from a few years ago. Going by the name Razzlekhan (“like Genghis Khan, but with more pizzazz,” proclaims her website), Morgan pumped out songs over the past few months that weren’t going to make it on the radio but could certainly make for a fun show.  “Razzlekhan is a surrealist artist with synesthesia making music for MI$FIT$. 💜🧞‍♀️ Razz creates sexy horror-comedy raps with an authentically awkward twang. This ‘digital bedouin’ gives you a taste of the silk road--from Cairo to Hong Kong,” says her Spotify page. The title of one song, “SaaSholes,” is a nod to her professional career as a SaaS entrepreneur.  Her song “GILFALICIOUS” is about a “gilf,” which one assumes is an acronym for “grandma I’d like to have coffee with” or thereabouts. “I made the song, GILFALICIOUS, as a humorous attack on #ageism against women & #sexism in general. If I make it to 90, this is EXACTLY how I want to be…” she said on Instagram. Unfortunately for her, there is a chance she may reach that age on the wrong side of prison bars.  Morgan’s partner, Dutch Lichtenstein, isn’t quite the same social media presence. He is, however, an alumnus of the prestigious Silicon Valley accelerator program Y Combinator; with that initial funding, he co-founded a data and adtech startup called MixRank which secured funding from Mark Cuban, among others (the company is still active, though Lichtenstein appears to have left in 2016).  He also advised decentralized identity startup Endpass, according to his LinkedIn profile. Morgan was Endpass’ CEO, per Crunchbase.  Occasionally, Lichtenstein took to Twitter to warn people about the threat of hacks. After a post by one Twitter user saying, “when you buy an ape on opensea it should pop up a big red warning sign that says never give your seed phrase to anyone, especially m*tamask support,” Lichtenstein chimed in with approval, saying, “There really should be a mandatory security tutorial with a test at the end for many crypto assets.”  Will Gottsegen and Danny Nelson contributed reporting.

42375332,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7HM7,1644352496,CoinList Aims to Reduce Miners’ Capital Costs With Low Collateral Filecoin Loans,"CoinList, a popular token sale platform for early-stage projects, is introducing a lending service that will require low collateral upfront to borrow filecoin (FIL), specifically for new miners to begin mining.  The company aims to help new miners lower their upfront cost by providing a FIL borrowing facility that requires collateral of as little as 10% of the total loan value. “By allowing for lower collateral, storage providers can allocate their funding to store [f]ilecoin+ deals, hardware and operations, rather than FIL or other forms of collateral, allowing them to scale their operations exponentially,” CoinList said in a statement.  To start mining FIL, new miners usually need to pledge some FIL tokens into the distributed data storage network; to do so, they need to either buy or borrow the coins on top of the capital they have already invested for the storage.  This is the “biggest pain point for newer storage providers” as borrowing the coins typically requires a high percentage of collateral upfront, ranging anywhere from 100% to 130%, Scott Keto, chief operating officer of CoinList, told CoinDesk, adding that it's “just not an efficient use of capital.”  Read more: Desperation Among Filecoin Miners Creating a Big Market for FIL Borrowing  Filecoin was designed by Protocol Labs to allow users to rent hard drive space to store data in a decentralized system. It uses a proof-of-storage consensus system, handing out rewards to nodes that store and verify the data.  CoinList has had a relationship with Protocol Labs since 2017, which enables CoinList to gain access to a wide variety of FIL holders and source individual loans greater than 250,000 FIL, according to a statement.  CoinList is able to secure FIL from various sources including through its lending platform, which offers about 9% APY for a holder of FIL to lend their coins, according to CoinList's website. The platform also sources FIL from other holders through CoinList’s relationship with Protocol Labs. “Given CoinList's strong relationship with Protocol Labs (worked together since 2017, including the filecoin launch in 2020) CoinList has a lot of FIL holders on its platform,” said a CoinList spokesperson.  “With more and more enterprises exploring Web 3, secure and trustworthy data storage has never been more important,” said Stefaan Vervaet, the storage providers lead at Protocol Labs. “This is an incredible opportunity for all storage providers, but especially new and smaller ones that are looking to grow fast, while storing real user data.”  The miners can provide the 10% collateral in FIL, bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) or stablecoins USDC and USDT. The rest of the loan will then be collateralized via the miners’ future earnings of FIL they receive as a reward for providing storage space.  The minimum loan size is 3,000 FIL. With low collateral, the interest rate tends to amount to around 10% to 30%, depending on the provider, according to Keto.  ‘Exponential growth’  To be sure, there are other platforms that are providing FIL loan services, including Binance and Youhodler, as demand for decentralized storage space rises. In fact, CoinList has already loaned over $450 million in FIL since October 2020.  “I think there's going to be exponential growth in 2022” for the decentralized storage providers, partly because of these new loan programs, but also due to the attractiveness of the business, Keto said.",POSITIVE,BTC | FIL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIL | MINING | TOKEN SALE,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/08/coinlist-aims-to-reduce-miners-capital-costs-with-low-collateral-filecoin-loans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/887dd30895aaed4e93afacb78aec9c87debd6258-1000x563.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417125,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS6hK9,1644351825,Your Staking Rewards Are Still Taxable,"Last week the proof-of-stake (POS) and wider cryptocurrency community celebrated what seemed like a victory following an Internal Revenue Service decision to concede a lawsuit filed by Joshua and Jessica Jarrett, who sought a $3,200 refund for taxes they paid on staking rewards in past years.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week  Much of the crypto community treated this as legal precedent, or as a signal the IRS will not tax staking rewards in the future. This analysis misinterprets the IRS decision. Staking rewards are incentives that blockchains pay participants for confirming transactions.  Omri Marian is a professor of law and the academic director of the Graduate Tax Program at the University of California, Irvine School of Law. The views expressed herein are his own.  From a legal perspective, the IRS decision is a nothingburger that could even help the IRS, if the agency’s aim is to more aggressively collect taxes on staking rewards. This possibility is why the Jarretts intend to refuse the refund and pursue the case. Had the refund been a “victory,” they would have walked away with the money.  Read More: US Crypto Tax Guide 2022  Why is the decision a nothingburger? Say you steal a car. The local police department investigates you, comes to believe you indeed stole the car and shares the investigation findings with the county prosecutor. For whatever reason – overworked department, underfunding or plain disinterest – the county prosecutor declines to file charges. Such a decision frees you from legal repercussions, but it does not mean that stealing a car is now legal.  This reasoning is likely behind the IRS’ Jarrett decision. The government lawyer overseeing the matter probably thought, “I am so constrained for time and recourses. I have thousands of active cases. I am not going to spend office time and money fighting in court over a $3,000 refund.”  That’s all. Neither a court nor the IRS decided anything, except that the agency could make better use of its time.  The end result: The IRS can still come after your staking rewards.  It might be because the IRS has a good basis to argue that unsold staking rewards are taxable. True, the IRS did not issue specific guidance on staking rewards, but it does not really need to. Current law and existing guidance are broad enough to capture unsold staking rewards under the definition of “income.”  The Jarretts filed their refund claim in the first place to challenge such interpretation of the law, not for the $3,000 refund. Partners at the law firm representing the taxpayers easily charge north of $1,000 per billable hour. I suspect the taxpayers have already accrued over $100,000 in legal fees.  Read More:US Lawmakers Don't Want Proof-of-Stake Networks to Get Overtaxed  A court ruling that unsold staking rewards are not taxable – not the refund – is the goal. So far, the taxpayers are losing this argument, simply because the IRS refuses to fight them.  The IRS refund decision should worry the POS community, not make it jubilant for two reasons.  If the IRS thinking is about something other than “I just don’t have time for this,” then the decision suggests the IRS believes staking rewards are taxable. The IRS may have declined to pursue this case because the agency believes it can make a better case elsewhere. By giving the taxpayers the refund the IRS extinguished the controversy, which is going to make it harder for the taxpayers to keep the case alive. It means that – if the case is not thrown out immediately – for the next couple of years the fight in court will be about whether the court should hear the case at all. So even if the case stays alive, it will be a long time before the court gets to discuss the issue on the merits.  Such delays give the IRS time to issue specific guidance on staking. Let’s say that in a year or two the IRS issues guidance that some or all unsold staking rewards are taxable. Such guidance will improve the IRS’ position in court because courts usually give weight to IRS guidance. The Jarretts are probably trying to force a court decision before the IRS gets a chance to issue guidance.The IRS can also try to delay any future litigation on the issue by telling courts that guidance is coming. Until then it will not pursue these types of cases. Of course, the IRS calculations can change if they need to start issuing larger refunds, but a $3,000 suit is not going to cut it.  I’ve said little about substance, and whether unsold staking rewards should or should not be taxable is a different topic on which reasonable minds can differ. I’ve focused on the ramifications of the IRS’ latest decision to issue a refund.  Read More: Crypto Capital Gains and Tax Rates 2022  As a tax scholar, I interpret this decision as legally meaningless. Other lawyers within the crypto community have noted as much. The IRS did not wave a white flag. The IRS did not concede anything important. Not only that, but the IRS may have signaled it is preparing a strong legal case to start collecting tax on staking rewards in earnest.  The day may come when the IRS decides not to tax unsold staking rewards. Or a court may decide they are not taxable. But the IRS refunding $3,000 to the Jarretts is not that day.

Recently, rallies have been few and far between, cutting the price per coin down to around $33,000 at the local low. The plummet, however, fell short of tagging a &apos;parabolic&apos; indicator and it could mean that the local bottom is in. Here is more about the Parabolic SAR, the potential signal, and other supporting evidence that the bottom might already be in. Parabolic Uptrend Intact, Says Indicator With 95% Confidence Rate Bitcoin price has repeatedly gone parabolic to conclude any major cycle peaks before entering a bear market.

42394293,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbQ3F,1644350042,Your Right to Anonymity Ends Where Risk to My Money Begins,"The past 10 days have been extremely eventful in the crypto world, as three dramatic events test the core values of the community – and, perhaps, highlight their limits.  First, in late January, came the revelation that 0xsifu, the pseudonymous co-founder and chief financial officer of the Wonderland DeFi (decentralized finance) project, was in fact Michael Patryn, aka. Omar Dhanani, who had previously played a major role in the $190 million QuadrigaCX fraud.  Then, on Feb. 4, came another identity revelation, as BuzzFeed unearthed the names of two of the Bored Ape Yacht Club founders.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Almost simultaneously, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) leader Brantly Millegan faced intense backlash after the discovery of 2016 tweets that expressed anti-gay, anti-trans and other troubling social views. Yesterday, he was removed from the ENS team.  Reactions to the three incidents varied in nuance and degree, but had a common thread. In both the BAYC and Wonderland cases, there were some who argued that the real villain was the investigator “doxing” anonymous founders or leaders. In the case of Brantly Millegan and ENS, a substantial portion of major crypto figures argued that Millegan’s sidelining was a concession to a “woke mob” enforcing its own standards of political correctness.  These reactions are linked by what they ignore: the element of power.  This is most obviously and troublingly visible in the swarm of mostly anonymous Twitter users who attacked the investigator @Zachxbt for exposing Patryn’s identity. The absurdity of this position is easy to spot. Bagholders were mad that the value of their Wonderland-linked tokens dropped after the revelation, but having a figure like Patryn directly handling the money flowing through the system represented a substantial risk of future instability. If Zachxbt had done nothing, that could have come much later – but the delay would only have yielded bigger losses, potentially spread across many more people and systems.  A similar dynamic is behind BuzzFeed’s highlighting of the identities of the BAYC co-founders, which had already been made public through corporate filings for Yuga Labs. There’s no indication at all that the BAYC team members are bad actors, but their leadership of a company valued at roughly $5 billion, with influence over the value of high-priced NFTs (non-fungible tokens) held by thousands of users, makes their identity a matter of legitimate public interest. If anything, you might argue BAYC holders should be happy – knowing that their assets are being managed by regular folks and not career scammers is good for their bags.  Crypto types love to believe they’re reinventing everything from scratch, and so they might be surprised by how useful it is to look at the literal centuries of thought already devoted to these issues. The case for public interest superseding the individual privacy of prominent figures has expanded, at least in the West, alongside rising levels of political freedom and democracy. That’s because (at least in theory) liberal democracy relies on public discourse to reach good policy decisions, and productive discussion requires good information – including good information about people with individual power to shape events.  The same logic applies to free markets, because individual decisions guide where resources are allocated and what behaviors are rewarded. It seems hard to argue that buyers of Wonderland assets were signaling informed confidence in the project if they didn’t know that one of the people in charge was an alleged repeat offender.  In other words, whether as a consumer or voter, you can’t make a real decision unless it is an informed decision. And over time, a bunch of collective decisions made on incomplete or inaccurate information can lead an entire industry, economy or even an entire society in the wrong direction. That’s why in the United States, as one legal analysis puts it, “public figures have almost no right to privacy, even when the published information about them is false.”  Similar principles hold, in varying degrees, across modern liberal democracies. It’s fundamental to how shared citizen governance is intended to work.  Of course, there are very good reasons that anonymity has become increasingly normalized in crypto in particular. On the one hand, more than a decade of regulatory uncertainty has left some ambiguity about what it’s actually legal to do in crypto. And in a few limited cases, there may be activities that break the law but adhere to a higher moral rationale.  In both instances, anonymous founders may be justified in following in the footsteps of Satoshi Nakamoto. But they must accept that they’re sacrificing some credibility when they go anonymous – and pseudonymity can’t be mistaken for carte blanche for bad actors to cover up their past actions, or escape responsibility for future ones.  There is a final mental knot to untie in all of this, which is the role of “decentralization.” If you took all the rhetoric around DeFi at face value, you might imagine that the identity of founders was irrelevant. Constant theoretical discussion of decentralized autonomous organizations and on-chain governance might give the impression that people like Brantly Millegan and Michael Patryn are merely engineers and caretakers. In principle, these systems aren’t intended to have “key leaders” whose singlehanded intervention can directly alter their development.  But, as Jump Trading’s bailout of the Wormhole protocol after a crippling hack demonstrated last week, we’re not there yet – perhaps one of the most important and widely overlooked truths in crypto. There are constant backstops, rollbacks and policy modifications in DeFi. The uncomfortable truth is that individuals with particular standing, skills or behind-the-scenes influence still wield enormous power over systems touted as democratizing finance.  That was the argument deployed by the ENS community as it removed Brantly Millegan. The concern wasn’t that his views were somehow existentially unacceptable (as homosexuality apparently is to Milligan), but that he would use his influence over the system to make it less usable by people whose identities he believes make them less than fully human.  Ultimately, the biggest failure may be that Millegan was seen as having that amount of power and influence in the first place.

The collection, to be sold as a single lot, is estimated by Sotheby's to fetch between $20 million to $30 million.  The group of 104 CryptoPunks on auction was acquired last July in a single blockchain transaction by anonymous collector “0x650d,” according to Sotheby’s. The transaction is also confirmed via Ethereum blockchain analytics site Etherscan.  The auction, titled “Punk It!,”https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2022/punk-it will be preceded by a live panel discussion on the history of NFTs and CryptoPunks.  CryptoPunks are a collection of 10,000 NFTs released in 2017 by Larva Labs featuring pixelated portraits of punk rock looking faces. Each NFT is unique, sporting various traits and accessories, such as blue bandanas, cigarettes or mohawks.  CryptoPunks have become one of the most successful NFT collections, with a current floor price of 67.5 ETH, or approximately $207,000 in today’s ether values. That's versus an average price of about $67,000 last July when the seller in the auction bought the lot of CryptoPunks, based on the $7 million purchase price reported by Bitcoinist.  Since launching in 2017, CryptoPunks have generated about 683,000 ETH in sales volume, or over $2 billion.  Celebrities such as Jay-Z and Jason Derulo have adopted CryptoPunks as profile pictures on their social media accounts.  “CryptoPunks are the original PFP series that created the template for other NFT projects that have followed, and which helped propel NFTs to the global stage as one of the most recognizable visual styles that have become synonymous with the digital art movement,” said Michael Bouhanna, Sotheby’s co-head of digital art, in a statement.

Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio Suggests Now May Be A Good Time To Buy As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the taker buy sell ratio metrics can be used to find viable entry and exit spots in the market. The &apos;Bitcoin taker buy volume&apos; is an indicator that measures the volume of buy orders filled by takers in perpetual swaps. Similarly, the &apos;taker sell volume&apos; measures the amount of sell orders. The &apos;taker buy ratio&apos; (or its sell counterpart) is defined as the ratio between the buy volume and the total volume on perpetual swaps. When the value of the taker buy ratio goes up, it means the buyers are currently willing to buy coins at a higher price. Such a trend shows that the buying pressure is currently stronger than the selling pressure. On the other hand, taker sell ratio moving up would indicate a shift towards a more bearish sentiment in the market. Related Reading | Is The Bitcoin Bottom In?

42375324,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7HDJ,1644344609,Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF Managers Bullish on Green Firms as Fund Begins Trading,"The managers of digital asset manager Valkyrie’s just-launched Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI) are betting heavily on publicly traded miners that primarily rely on renewable energy since they expect them to prevail over their peers.  “We believe that companies that are focusing on more renewable energy sources are going to win in the end,” as alternative energy sources such as hydro-electric, solar and natural gas will be able to provide better cost savings to miners as opposed to traditional sources of energy such as coal, the fund’s Chief Investment Officer Steven McClurg told CoinDesk. He added that “coal energy is going to cost a whole lot more in the future.”  “We found that these mining companies [that are using mostly renewable energy] have already gone the extra step versus other initiatives, such as carbon neutral pledges, and they tend to maintain a lower overhead because renewable energy often costs less than other sources,” he added.  Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF started trading on the Nasdaq Tuesday under the ticker “WGMI” and shares were up 0.8% in early trading. The exchange-traded fund (ETF) comes with an expense ratio of 0.75%.  The fund’s mandate is to invest 80% of its net assets in miners that derive a minimum of 50% of their profit from bitcoin mining and primarily use renewable energy. Valkyrie notes the miners in the fund’s portfolio use about 77% renewable energy, compared to average renewable energy usage throughout the U.S. of 31%. The top five holdings of the fund (all with allocations in the 8% to 10% range apiece) are Argo Blockchain (ARBK), Bitfarms (BITF), Cleanspark (CLSK), Hive Blockchain (HIVE) and Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG).  The fund also invests in chip companies that help manufacture mining rigs. Some of the holdings include Nvidia (NVDA), Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).  Mining remains profitable  Aside from its mining-focused ETF, Valkyrie also has two other ETFs that provide investors direct and indirect exposure to bitcoin. The Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which was launched last year, invests primarily in bitcoin futures. Meanwhile, Balance Sheet Opportunities ETF (VBB), which debuted in December, focuses on public companies that invest in bitcoin.  The decision to launch another ETF in the digital asset sector was based on the idea that miners using alternative energy not only give investors exposure to a very profitable business but also to a lot of innovations in renewable energy usage. “We thought that it was a really good time to enter this market given the potential profitability and innovative things miners are doing on the renewable side,” McClurg said.  In fact, Wall Street investment bank D.A. Davidson’s analyst Chris Brendler wrote in a research note on Monday that mining remains very profitable with gross margins over 80%, even as the hash price, a measure of daily revenue per terahash of mining computing power, has fallen to about $0.20 from peak of $0.40 as crypto prices have fallen.  Meanwhile, The Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), a global forum of bitcoin mining companies and others in the industry, said a new survey showed that bitcoin miners are now utilizing a 66.1% mix of sustainable energy for their mining operations. BMC estimates that the global mining industry’s sustainable electricity mix grew to about 58.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021, up 1% from the third quarter, making it one of the most sustainable industries globally.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/08/valkyrie-bitcoin-miners-etf-managers-bullish-on-green-firms-as-fund-begins-trading,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fc7e283ea3ee7f68d260fe458504972239bf699-1500x1238.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The organizations in question emerged during the so-called Maidan revolution in 2014, when the pro-Russia President Victor Yanukovich was ousted. After that, Russia invaded and annexed the Crimea peninsula and fueled a civil war in the Eastern part of Ukraine. That's when the volunteer groups started helping Ukrainian armed forces and targeting pro-Russian militants.  The groups rely on both fiat and crypto donations; however, bitcoin donations in particular have increased significantly over the past year, Elliptic said, because using the crypto allows international donors to bypass financial institutions that have blocked payments to these groups. For example, the bitcoin wallet of Come Back Alive, a non-governmental organization (NGO) raising funds to help the Ukrainian army, raised over 3.8 BTC since August 2021, with a few donations as large as 1 or 2 BTC.  Hacktivist group Ukrainian Cyber Alliance, which targets pro-Russian militants in the eastern region of Donbass, managed to raise about $100,000 over the past year in bitcoin, ether, litecoin and several stablecoins, Elliptic said.  Another project, Mirotvorets, a website publishing the names and personal data of Russians considered by the project's team to be ""enemies of Ukraine,"" has received over 6.9 BTC since 2020 at its bitcoin donations address. The project has gained some controversy as in 2016, it published, among other data, a list of all journalists accredited by the separatists government of the breakaway region of Donbass, along with their contact information.  Another hacktivist group, Belarus-based Cyber Partisans, responded to the rising tensions between Ukraine and Russia by attacking the Belarussian railroad in January to prevent it from being used to transport Russian troops to the Ukrainian border.

Alfa Romeo, which is owned by Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler), appears to be the first carmaker to utilize NFTs in this way, seemingly in a bid to bring transparency and efficiency to a car market that often relies on third parties to track car records.  “Digitalization is a key enabler of our metamorphosis,” Francesco Calcara, head of marketing at Alfa Romeo, said in a media briefing. “[The NFTs] will sustain the residual values of our models as we are the first in the market to adopt this next-generation technology.”  The company says the car’s NFT will be able to generate a certificate from records of its maintenance data, but only for service done by certified dealers.  The integration is the latest example of the growing “useful” NFT market, which includes use cases for the technology that emphasize function over form.  Other recent useful NFT examples include a real estate company minting a housing deed as an NFT, health care companies working on encrypting and transferring medical records as NFTs and tokens serving as proof of ownership for physical collectibles.  In the same media briefing, Alfa Romeo announced it would be pivoting to sell only electric vehicles by 2027.

42375330,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7HIL,1644339657,NFT Trading Card Game Skyweaver Wraps Yearslong Tech Build With Public Launch,"After years of development, a blockchain-based trading card game is hoping to attract crossover appeal with a gaming community that so far has proven to be suspicious of non-fungible tokens (NFT).  On Tuesday, Skyweaver announced the launch of its Open Beta after months of private access-only gameplay.  The game has been in development since 2019, when Reddit co-founder Alex Ohanian led a $3.5 million funding round. In the years since then, multiple blockchain-based trading card game competitors have emerged, including Parallel and Gods Unchained, and the company may have missed a window to launch into peak NFT mania, which occurred over the summer 2021.  Read more: Scams and Fraud Bubble Up as NFT Mania Takes Hold  However, slow-rolling the launch has yielded some benefits, including a number of advanced functionalities and a quietly burgeoning player base.  Indeed, by the numbers the Skyweaver is already one of the most popular blockchain-based games on the market. The game’s phone app boasts 233,000 installs, a waitlist of 345,000 users and $1.7 million in sales on the project’s decentralized marketplace, according to a press release.  It remains to be seen, however, if the game can achieve true crossover appeal with users who are unfamiliar with blockchain technology.  NFT AMM  For those initiated in the ways of Web 3, one of Skyweaver’s core features will be highly recognizable: a decentralized card marketplace.  The Skyweaver team co-authored the ERC-1155 token standard, which allows for non-fungible tokens to interact with smart contracts the same way fungible tokens might – in this case, for their cards to work in Skyweaver’s Niftyswap NFT automated market maker (AMM).  While the swamp of acronyms may be difficult to grasp on a technical level, ultimately it adds up to an “intuitive” user experience for players, Skyweaver co-founder Michael Sanders told CoinDesk.  “We created the Niftyswap protocol to enable seamless trading of these goods. We think this is important for Web 2 gamers to provide an intuitive marketplace where you can buy or sell the cards you’re looking for, rather than having to engage in this bid/order/sell process,” he said.  The Niftyswap protocol is open source, and Sanders expects the marketplace to play a key role in the development of the game’s “meta” – a term for popular strategies that emerge among competitive players.  “The ability for anyone to look at performing best, acquire those cards and influence that deck’s ranking, it makes the meta super dynamic, and we think it makes it really fun for players, too,” said Sanders.  Next steps  Following the launch, the focus for the team is to reach crossover appeal to players who may be interested in the game and its mechanics but are unfamiliar with blockchain technology.  So far, multiple professional trading card game players have voiced support, and Twitch streams of tournaments have proven to be popular – both promising signs that Skyweaver might be able to get a foothold among regular users.  “The overwhelming response has been that these players adore Skyweaver for its gameplay alone – the strategy, the depth, the graphics, the new mechanics, all of that. They also love the player-owned economy, and I’ve seen how it can help them realize the potential of NFT economies,” Sanders said.  Additionally, Sanders hinted that a governance token may be in the cards further down the line.  “In terms of a single token, we have some interesting plans in the works that we’ve been ideating over many years. Before adding a single token, we decided to take a game-first approach to ensure Skyweaver is awesome, fun and players love it, and then we can add more blockchain-oriented aspects,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/08/nft-trading-card-game-skyweaver-wraps-yearslong-tech-build-with-public-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e195529ed10d237d3a6d36ecf74493ac4e96a0f-1769x999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375341,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7HYh,1644338776,US Officials Seize $3.6B in Bitcoin From 2016 Bitfinex Hack,"Federal officials seized some $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin tied to the 2016 hack of the crypto exchange Bitfinex.  Agents arrested two individuals in New York on Tuesday on charges they conspired to launder proceeds from the Bitfinex hack in 2016. The married couple, Ilya ""Dutch"" Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, will appear in court at 3:00 p.m. ET in New York, according to a U.S. Department of Justice press release.  Some 120,000 BTC was stolen in the 2016 hack, then worth around $60 million and representing nearly one-sixth of the total trading volume at the time. At today's prices, the total amount of bitcoin stolen is valued at $4.5 billion, but the DOJ only seized about 94,000 BTC valued at $3.6 billion. The DOJ release alleges the two conspired to launder these proceeds and heavily implies, but does not claim, they were the original hacker(s).  “Unauthorized transactions” moved the stolen bitcoin to Lichtenstein’s wallet, and some 25,000 of the BTC were transferred out over the past five years. The remaining 94,000 BTC remained in Lichtenstein’s wallet.  “After the execution of court-authorized search warrants of online accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan, special agents obtained access to files within an online account controlled by Lichtenstein,” the press release said. “Those files contained the private keys required to access the digital wallet that directly received the funds stolen from Bitfinex, and allowed special agents to lawfully seize and recover more than 94,000 bitcoin that had been stolen from Bitfinex. The recovered bitcoin was valued at over $3.6 billion at the time of seizure.""  Last week, on-chain sleuths spotted a transfer of over 94,000 of Bitfinex bitcoin. Sources told CoinDesk the transfer was a seizure conducted by federal agents. In a statement, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said it was “the department’s largest financial seizure ever.”  According to an attached statement of facts, “U.S. authorities traced the stolen funds on the BTC blockchain” as proceeds from the hack moved out of the initial recipient wallet to wallets allegedly controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan.  Law enforcement officials were able to access the initial recipient wallet, dubbed Wallet 1CGA4s, after decrypting a file “saved to Lichtenstein’s cloud storage account,” which included 2,000 crypto wallet addresses and their private keys.  “Blockchain analysis confirmed that almost all of those wallets were directly linked to the hack,” the statement said.  The defendants allegedly used a number of techniques to launder the stolen bitcoin, including splitting transactions up into “thousands” of smaller transactions, using darknet markets and converting into other types of crypto such as monero.  The statement named darknet market AlphaBay as one such platform allegedly used by the defendants.  The statement of facts further alleges some of the funds went to an account tied to a company called SalesFolk, which was owned by Morgan.  LinkedIn profiles show a Heather R. Morgan and Dutch Ilya Lichtenstein have listed themselves as employees of SalesFolk since 2009 and 2014, respectively. Morgan’s LinkedIn suggests she was also a former columnist at Inc. Magazine and Forbes, while Lichtenstein’s lists previous roles at MixRank, Endpass and 500 Startups.  In a statement, Bitfinex said it would work with the DOJ to try and recover the seized bitcoin. If it does, it will repay investors in its UNUS SED LEO token, which was created to try and backstop a fiscal hole created after an unrelated payment processor used by Bitfinex was seized by authorities in three different countries.  “If Bitfinex receives a recovery of the stolen bitcoin, as described in the UNUS SED LEO token white paper, Bitfinex will, within 18 months of the date it receives that recovery, use an amount equal to 80% of the recovered net funds to repurchase and burn outstanding UNUS SED LEO tokens,” the company said. “These token repurchases can be accomplished in open market transactions or by acquiring UNUS SED LEO in over-the-counter trades, including directly trading bitcoin for UNUS SED LEO.”  The LEO token began pumping against the dollar on Bitfinex around 16:41 UTC, just after the news came out, climbing from $4.97 to over $7 within an hour.

Even though layer-2 scaling solutions involving zkSNARKS and Optimistic Rollups have been introduced to alleviate these challenges, most of these answers aim to improve Ethereum&apos;s scalability. On the other hand, Moonbeam leverages the interoperability and scalability of Polkadot to offer developers an environment that is fully compatible with Ethereum and its corresponding development tools. The Moonbeam Network serves as a highly-specialized layer-1 blockchain. Accordingly, it isn&apos;t here to compete with Ethereum but will assuredly extend Ethereum&apos;s base functionalities with Polkadot&apos;s built-in features like on-chain governance, cross-chain integrations, and staking. Since Ethereum already holds the lion&apos;s share of the DeFi ecosystem (and the majority of the dApps are deployed atop it), it is quite certain that even in a multichain future, it will continue to hold a commanding position. In this context, Moonbeam will offer developers the ability to migrate their existing Ethereum-based projects to its network without making any major codebase changes. At the same time, it will extend a project&apos;s reach to other chains (and users) who are already part of the Polkadot network.

42394550,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBjHb,1644337612,Buying NFTs During Presales and Public Mints: Things You Should Know,"New non-fungible token (NFT) collections pop up every other day, offering collectors an opportunity to become the first buyer of an NFT – a process known as “minting.”  When it comes to navigating NFTs, minting as a term may seem confusing because it refers both to a collection becoming part of the blockchain and to a collector buying an item from that collection for the first time. We will focus on minting in the latter sense.  One of the main benefits of minting NFTs is investors are able to buy into a collection at the earliest possible opportunity. That means they stand the best chance of making a profit if the NFT collection goes on to soar in value once it’s listed on secondary NFT marketplaces like OpenSea.  But high rewards come with high risks, and NFTs are no exception. When investing in non-fungible assets, you may find that your funds will become more illiquid (more difficult to cash out) than if you had invested in fungible cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. For example, selling bitcoin can be done at any time across a huge range of exchanges, mobile applications and brokerage platforms. But with NFTs, you are typically limited to just a handful of marketplaces – some of which have a limited number of buyers.  Fast-changing norms of NFT sales  The Bored Ape Yacht Club is now the world’s most valuable NFT collection, with a floor price of 100 ETH (around $270,000 at the time of writing). The public mint of the collection took place in late April 2021 and lasted several days. Those first in line were able to snag the hugely desirable NFTs at just 0.08 ETH ($217) each.  Admittedly, there wasn’t a great deal of competition to mint NFTs prior to the sector’s boom in early 2021. But as the NFT market has continued to evolve and expand, the minting processes took on new forms.  These days, many NFT projects come to market through a two-tiered system. Instead of launching only through a public sale, projects might run a pre-sale first.  Getting whitelisted for the presale  The holy grail in NFT mints these days is a whitelist spot. These provide access to the presale, which takes place either a few days or several hours before the main public sale.  Presale mint prices are often lower than the those in a public sale. But the low price isn’t the only reason why whitelists are highly sought after. Having a guaranteed slot to mint an NFT takes the pressure off from competing to mint during a public sale when the collection has a limited supply.  The requirements of whitelist eligibility vary by NFT projects. They will normally be listed in the “announcements” on the project’s Discord channel, and the link to join the Discord channel will be shared on the project’s Twitter feed.  Typically, projects will hand out whitelist spots based on engagement on the messaging app Discord. NFT projects like a good buzz, and they will reward the most active community members who contribute to that. Chat frequency and friend invitations are common metrics.  The NFT project might also give whitelist spots on Twitter to those who help get the word out by tweeting about the upcoming collection.  Some projects may call whitelists by different names, like ""pregame"" or ""star list."" But the idea remains the same.  Read More: Crypto Discord 101: Where to Go, What to Know  The NFT grind  Like with anything in crypto involving the potential to make a lucrative return on your investment, there’s a catch.  Whitelist requirements have recently become so exacting and time-consuming that many NFT traders refer to the process as “grinding.”  Invisible Friends, a project that has yet to launch as of this writing, requires prospective collectors to purchase a branded hoodie and beanie for $150 in order to be entered into a raffle. This only gives people a chance of getting on the whitelist.  Minting during the presale  If you have snagged a whitelist spot, congratulations! You will be able to mint an NFT during the presale by going to the project’s website, connecting your crypto wallet and clicking “mint.”  Caution must be exercised however, as scams pretending to be presale NFT launches are common on Discord. Project administrators will never privately message you with a mint link, but plenty of scammers will.  It’s important to think of minting like entering a lottery drawing. You often can’t choose which artwork you get to mint, meaning you have no control over the rarity of the piece you receive. The so-called “reveal” may happen sometime after the public sale, when the whole collection has been minted.  Secondary markets open for trading right after the presale, and so you can sell or buy an unrevealed NFT before the public sale if you wanted to secure a quick profit.  Public sales and gas wars  The mechanics of public sales are similar to presales – you connect your crypto wallet and mint – but you may well fail to mint an NFT if there’s too much demand. Not to mention, rampant demand can send Ethereum gas prices soaring.  Public sales operate on a first-come-first-served basis. To be the first person to get served, savvy NFT traders will engage in “gas wars.” That involves offering increasingly higher tips to miners in the hope their transactions will be processed faster than other competing minters.  To make matters worse, you’ll still be required to pay gas fees even if your transaction fails, and so you should proceed carefully. The blockchain doesn’t issue refunds.  Finally, when all is said and done, remember there’s no guarantee your NFT will be worth more than the public or presale prices when you try to sell it on a secondary market.

42375338,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7HXR,1644332413,ETH Staking Startup ssv.network Raises $10M as Ethereum ‘Merge’ Inches Closer,"Ethereum’s shift to a staking-based consensus mechanism has highlighted the influence centralized providers might wield over the decentralized network. In turn, developers are racing to build infrastructure that might avert such an outcome after the network’s so-called “merge.”  Ssv.network, one such effort, said Tuesday that it had amassed $10 million to fund development of decentralized staking infrastructure. Its focus is on deploying “secret shared validators” that fragment control of the network’s validators between multiple nodes.  At the time of writing, ssv.network’s testnet touted 2,661 operators and 7,954 validators with 254,528 ETH staked. Their collective effort powers an open-source network that project backers claim will “mitigate” the biggest vulnerabilities in centralized staking.  For example, client concentration continues to be an issue on the Beacon Chain, with over 68% of validators running Prsym as their consensus client. Large staking pools like Coinbase and Kraken have inadvertently increased client concentration and left the proof-of-stake chain susceptible to potential chain splits, correlated slashing and finality issues down the road.  “SSV fits into what we call layer zero, which is basically what secures Ethereum,” core contributor Alon Muroch said in an interview. “I think it’s very important that a lot of people care about it, because they want to keep Ethereum decentralized.”  It also gets at some of the less-visible realities of the Eth 2 staking landscape. It’s easy enough to see that big fish like Kraken and Coinbase represent a considerable percentage of staked ETH. Less prominent is the fact that validator client Prysm has around 70% market share.  Still, the biggest fish aren’t missing the boat. Coinbase, Lukka and OKX are among ssv.network’s backers, as is Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent company).",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | FORKS,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/08/eth-staking-startup-ssvnetwork-raises-10m-as-ethereum-merge-inches-closer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a177e66776cf7e772ce1cf2b97d15b93b40954e6-4767x3307.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375337,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7HUv,1644332400,LIVE BLOG: The House Talks Stablecoins,"The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services is discussing stablecoin regulations with Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang. The hearing, coming in the wake of a report from the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, will seek to better understand the possible risks regulators see in stablecoin proliferation, as well as what sort of regulatory framework can best address them.  CoinDesk reporters Nikhilesh De and Helene Braun will cover the hearing live as it happens.     2:15 p.m. (ND) And with that, the hearing has ended. My quick takeaway is we don't yet have a sense of if or when legislation specific to stablecoins will be introduced. Today felt far more like a fact-finding mission, and a substantive one at that. A lot of the questions were detailed and they vastly outnumbered those that were clearly designed to secure a soundbite.  2:09 p.m. (HB) Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) said he doesn't see why there has to be federally insured regulation of stablecoins when they are ""constrained to the crypto economy.""  2:04 p.m. (HB) Rep. William Timmons (R-S.C.) urged lawmakers to find a better path forward. ""Disruption is a natural part of a free-market economy … and it forces adaption and almost always leads to better products for consumers and more prosperity for our communities,"" he said.  1:56 p.m. (ND) The question of whether crypto is in a bubble appeared: Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.) pointed to BitFury CEO and former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks' previous comments that while early days may be turbulent, price charts go up and to the right over the long run.  Liang said price declines might not have implications for the broader economy, but individual consumers might be at risk.  1:54 p.m. (ND) Rep. Brian Steil (R-Wis.) emphasized that he did not want to see overregulation that might kill any possible innovation.  1:27 p.m. (HB) Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) raised the question of why we need private stablecoins if there is a central bank digital currency. Liang said that the point is that right now, there is no CBDC, but there are many private stablecoins that rise in popularity. However, she said that they could go away once a CBDC is to be introduced.  1:21 p.m. (HB) Kevin Greene, CEO of Tassat Group, said in a statement that blockchain payments are already possible within currently regulated entities.  “While it is important to address the risks associated with unregulated and underregulated non-bank issued stablecoins, which were clearly outlined by Under Secretary Liang in her testimony today, we encourage policymakers to also support cutting edge payment options that operate within the existing regulatory framework that has served the American banking system well for over one hundred years,"" he said in a statement emailed to CoinDesk.  1:15 p.m. (HB) Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Fla.) asked if a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would diminish the value of the stablecoins that are already out there and Jiang agreed there would be a lot of issues in terms of designing a CBDC and how they could co-exist with stablecoins.  1:06 p.m. (HB) Rep. David Kustoff (R-Tenn.) brought up China and the country's introduction of the digital yuan. Liang said that China introduced the digital yuan in some part as a way to take back control that they had lost to private firms. She added that China doesn't value privacy as much as the United States does which is why the lessons learned from their introduction of a digital currency versus how the U.S. will approach it is ""less direct.""  12:52 p.m. (HB) Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) called for a more detailed discussion on stablecoins and to distinguish between the various issuers out there. He called tether (USDT) a ""time bomb"" but said USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, is a ""highly regulated asset."" He also criticized the President Working Group's report, calling it a ""big bank protection concept.""  12:34 p.m. (HB) Rep. Alexander Mooney (R-W.V.) asked about a timeline for congressional action, while at the same time echoing Liang in recognizing the complexity of the issue and the need to get things right instead of quickly.  12:16 p.m. (HB) Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) admitted her view of cryptocurrencies has changed: ""At one time, I probably thought this was more like the wild, wild west of what we're doing, and now I realize that it is the future frontier, and wow, I don't want to over-regulate to the point that it chokes off innovation.""  12:09 p.m. (HB) Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) pointed out that while stablecoins represent just 5% of the digital asset industry's total value, they account for more than 75% of crypto trading, which is why they can't be ignored. He also criticized the President's Working Group report, noting that while it doesn't even provide a definition of stablecoins, it didn't hesitate to assert that their risks are broad and cross numerous jurisdictional lines. A bank-like regulatory framework, said Emmer, would be improper for stablecoins and inadvertently engulf potential future financial products that are vastly different than what is now considered a stablecoin.  Emmer: ""Banks should not be the only institutions in the ecosystem with dibs to issue the potential array of financial products that the President's Working Group report simply lumps together and ties as a stablecoin.""  12:01 p.m. (HB) Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) asked about the possibility of a federal money transmitter license. ""That is a possibility definitely worth exploring,"" Liang said.  11:42 a.m. (HB) Rep. Jim A. Himes (D-Conn.) said the question isn't if we should allow stablecoins or not, but instead about how we regulate them in a way that doesn't kill innovation. ""There's a radical difference between a stablecoin which is fully backed dollar for dollar with reserves … and [dogecoin],"" he said. This means stablecoins need to be regulated in a different manner than other riskier cryptos.  ""[Stablecoins] should be held accountable to actually be able to provide that stability when demanded,"" responded Undersecretary Liang.  11:38 a.m. (HB) Rep. Andy Barr (R-Kent.) said he worries ""it's inconsistent to take the position that only banks should be allowed to issue stablecoins.""  11:26 a.m. (HB) Rep. Bill Posey brought up concerns regarding Tether's backing. Tether is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization.  ""They are not fully collateralized under all conditions. … I do have concerns about the opacity of the reserve assets of stablecoin issuers,"" Liang said.  11:17 a.m. (ND) Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), noting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's settlement with USDT issuer Tether, asking if the working felt that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had the authority to audit stablecoins as a result of the Commodity Futures Act. Liang said she would have to defer to the agency.  11:13 a.m. (HB) Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) brought up DOGE: ""If you invest in nothing, there is a good likelihood that at some point you'll get what you pay for and that causes me a good deal of concern.""  11:08 a.m. (HB) Liang: ""[Stablecoins] are bank-like products … as well as an investment-like product which is why we believe there was a regulatory gap.""  11:07 a.m. (ND) Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) asked why the PWG report did not conduct any analysis on whether stablecoins might fall under securities law or policy issues under securities laws.  Liang said the group focused on the idea of stablecoins as a payments tool and tried to ""identify gaps in regulation"" with that specific use case.  Huizenga seems dissatisfied with this response, saying it's unclear how stablecoins might fall under securities laws: ""Why would you not do that analysis if we don't have a clear picture?""  Liang says she would have to defer to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  10:55 a.m. (HB) Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.) asked if there's a way to incentivize stablecoin issuers to use the U.S. dollar as backing to ensure stability.  ""They have a natural incentive to use the US dollar because it is the global currency. I believe the incentives we need to put in place is to ensure it remains,"" Liang said.  10:51 a.m. (HB) Rep. Sherman also said Facebook's libra (later diem) proposed stablecoin had so much money and power behind it that it could've emerged as an everyday currency.  10:49 a.m. (ND) Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) said the risks from stablecoins could affect both investors and the monetary system.  ""We're talking about the risks to investors and they are substantial,"" he said.  He asked Liang if she could offer ""specific statutes"" that Congress could implement as part of her work with the President's Working Group.  10:47 a.m. (HB) Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) said we must ensure that ""any federal regulatory framework provides clarity and also ensures that the regulation fits the activity rather than simply overlaying traditional banking regulation over stablecoins.""  10:45 a.m. (ND) Third parties are weighing in on what stablecoin regulation could mean for the digital asset industry in the U.S. Nick Anthony, manager at the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary & Financial Alternatives, told CoinDesk that limiting stablecoin issuance to banks may be an issue.  ""Chairwoman [Maxine] Waters has stressed both in her opening and questions that she is concerned about stablecoins and their so-called concentration of power. If she really is concerned about market concentration, she should reject the PWG's recommendation to limit issuance to banks. Cryptocurrencies offer an unprecedented source of competition for the banking industry and that is something that should be welcomed. Limiting issuance will only serve to exacerbate market concentration issues,"" he said.  The Bank Policy Institute, a bank lobbyist group, sent the committee written testimony ahead of the hearing. In a statement, senior vice president and associate general counsel Paige Pidano Paridon said Congress ""should take swift measures in coordination with U.S. regulators to establish clear rules.""  ""Digital asset innovation is well past proof-of-concept stages, gaining steam and has thus far been happening outside of the regulated banking sector while banks await guidance. Absent such guidance, the highly regulated banking sector will be left on the sidelines as digital asset innovations continue to advance unchecked in the unregulated sectors, with little to no government oversight to ensure the safety and soundness of our financial system and the protection of ordinary American consumers,"" she said.  10:35 a.m. (HB) ""If stablecoins are backed by high quality assets, their risk is quite low and they can form a building block and a cornerstone of a payment system,"" Liang said.  10:32 a.m (HB) Rep. Patrick McHenry pointed out that there's no mention of any state regulatory framework in the PWG's report. ""The principal reason is that the state regulatory system is fragmented. … There's no plenary oversight of the entire arrangement,"" said Liang.  10:30 a.m. (HB) ""The PWG report believes that a more consistent, less fragmented framework is preferred,"" Liang said.  10:21 a.m. (HB) Liang said that technology companies should not be allowed to issue cryptocurrencies as a payment instrument. Rep. Maxine Waters asked about Facebook's Libra (later Diem) project and raised concerns about the amount of sensitive data that those companies have access to.  10:17 a.m. (HB) Liang welcomes the members of the Committee and reiterates the profound impact that stablecoins could have on the financial system and economy, while also stressing its threat to it. ""But stablecoins also raise policy concerns, including those related to illicit finance, user protection, and systemic risk. To mitigate these risks while supporting the potential benefits from innovation, Treasury believes that regulation of stablecoins should be clear and consistent.""  10:13 a.m. (HB) Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) stresses that it's not right to only focus on the risks of stablecoins, but that it's important recognize its potential to the digital ecosystem. ""We cannot regulate out of fear for the future. … Requiring stablecoins to only be issued by banks would be a major obstacle for us to continue to foster innovation within this nascent industry.""  10:06 a.m. (HB) Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) started off the hearing, discussing the potential risks of stablecoins for the economy and communities, while also stressing the opportunities it brings to the financial system. ""Investigations have shown that many of these so-called stablecoins are not in fact backed by full reserve assets. Moreover, due to the speculative trading, and the lack of investor protection, stablecoins could even threaten our financial stability.""  10:00 a.m. (ND) Hey folks, and welcome to our coverage of today's hearing on stablecoin regulations. To set the stage: This is the first of at least two hearings we'll see on this topic. The Senate Banking Committee has its own hearing planned for next week.  The focus today will be on how best Congress can implement the report's recommendations, as well as how to approach these issues. It's a full committee hearing, meaning more than 50 members of the House of Representatives will have the opportunity to ask our sole witness questions over the next few hours.",NEUTRAL,USDT,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | USDT,"Nikhilesh De, Helene Braun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/08/live-blog-the-house-talks-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56e13a6ea7819d17bad45a1aef035298a7e48abf-5444x3629.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393982,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bsQNH9,1644330972,Ads of the ‘Crypto-Bowl’,"One of the consequences of crypto’s explosive growth throughout 2021 was a parallel boom in marketing.  It didn’t used to be that celebrities would go on late night talk shows and shill their non-fungible tokens. People didn’t even know what NFTs were, really, until last winter.  Now, in 2022, several major sports arenas are named for crypto companies. Matt Damon – he of “Bourne” and “The Departed” – stars in a crypto ad that recently merited a takedown in the New York Times Magazine. This past week, a hollow, golden cube advertising a no-name crypto project appeared in New York City's Central Park. And nearby, overlooking Columbus Circle, you’ll see a banner ad for Gemini, the Winklevoss twins’ crypto exchange.  Crypto feels inescapable this year, and not only for writers at cryptocurrency websites. So it only makes sense that crypto would make its way to this year’s Super Bowl, which – even now, as more and more people turn away from traditional TV broadcasts – remains one of the most visible advertising platforms in the world. Last year, 91 million people watched.  The crypto ad blitz continues  FTX, an exchange that’s already made significant investments in the world of sports marketing, is maybe the least surprising of this year’s crypto entrants.  The Miami Heat’s American Airlines Arena is now named FTX Arena, thanks to a 19-year deal with the franchise. FTX is also the official crypto exchange of Major League Baseball – its logo appears on every umpire’s uniform – and has sponsorship deals with the National Basketball Association’s Golden State Warriors and Washington Wizards. It’s even made a push into esports: FTX has agreed to pay the competitive gaming organization TSM $210 million to add the letters “FTX” to its name.  FTX has already run ads with recently retired pro quarterback Tom Brady, who’s also an investor in the company, so it’s reasonable to expect he’ll show up in the exchange’s Super Bowl ad, too, although there’s no confirmation on that just yet.  The exchange is even planning to give away some bitcoin as part of a promotional push tied to the exact time its ad runs. “If the spot airs at 9:45 [p.m.] ET, they will give away 9.45 BTC to four people,” a representative for FTX told Blockworks.  Crypto.com, the exchange behind the much-derided Matt Damon ads, and a recent partner of basketball icon Lebron James, has also purchased some airtime at this year’s Super Bowl.  The Damon ads generated controversy for their feigned gravity and self-seriousness; in them, the actor strolls through an imaginary landscape, flanked by what the company assures us are history’s greatest heroes and adventurers. It suggests that to purchase cryptocurrency through Crypto.com is to join the ranks of the great strivers – the climbers who scaled Everest or astronauts heading into space.  It’s silly, but here we are talking about it. So maybe the ad did its job. Like FTX, Crypto.com is keeping quiet as to the content of its ad. Super Bowl ads tend to be jokey and lighthearted, so maybe the company will switch it up for the main event.  “Crypto genuinely is for everybody,” said Steven Kalifowitz, chief marketing office at Crypto.com, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. “Going into different sports just allows me to reach everybody where they are. Super Bowl is just one more step into that, where it’s as mass as you get.”  Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, is taking a sort of meta tack to its first-ever Super Bowl ad campaign. A teaser, featuring Jimmy Butler of the Miami Heat, warns viewers to beware of companies bearing overly friendly crypto messages.  “On February 13th, you’re going to hear some of the biggest names telling you to get into crypto,” Butler intones. “But they don’t know you, or your finances. Only you do. Binance and I are here to tell you, trust yourself, and of course, do your own research.”  Binance has launched a promo website, cryptocelebalert.com, and plans to give out 2,222 POAPs (commemorative tokens from a company called Proof of Attendance Protocol) to viewers during the game.  Of course, the idea of “doing your own research” is core to crypto’s security philosophy, which privileges individual responsibility above all else – it doesn’t mitigate the dangers.  Read more: This Super Bowl, Don’t Trust Celebrity Crypto Endorsements (Don’t Trust Yourself, Either)  “When you have a lot of celebrities out there telling you to embrace the YOLO culture, to be bold and brave and things of that ilk, it incentivizes people to forego that critical stage of doing their research,” said Binance Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillmann, taking a direct at the Damon ad. “We want to take this moment in time, when the whole world is watching on Feb. 13, and seeing all these new ads, to just remind people that, hey, yes, we should all be excited about this industry, but we need to be responsible, too.”  Even the Super Bowl’s venue is repping crypto this year – SoFi Stadium is named for a personal finance company and loan platform that has been pushing digital money since before it was trendy.  And while FTX, Crypto.com and Binance are the major confirmed candidates for crypto Super Bowl ads, don’t be surprised if other fintech companies join the crusade.  Advertisers already know they can sell things like insurance and beer to football fans. But sports people also love betting, and there’s data to prove it. No small wonder crypto companies are targeting risk-tolerant audiences like these, as opposed to National Public Radio listeners. DraftKings, the official sports betting partner of this year’s Super Bowl, will debut a commercial of its own during the game.  Expect to see ads from Quickbooks and TurboTax, too, potentially with warnings about the upcoming nightmare of tax season from a crypto perspective.  Meta – not explicitly a crypto company, though the fate of its “metaverse” may end up involving some degree of blockchain tech – will also air a Super Bowl ad this year, for its confusingly named Meta Quest 2 headset. A short promotional clip teases a 1960s era diner called “Questy’s.”  It reminds me a little of the inexplicable 1950s diner in “Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones” in the sense that it represents a lack of imagination. Here’s a universe where you can build anything, a virtual space with endless possibilities for bringing new ideas to life; and here’s … a diner?  Meta’s stock recently suffered its largest single-day drop ever, thanks to a disappointing earnings report. People are generally skeptical about Mark Zuckerberg’s vision for the metaverse, too – maybe the Super Bowl ad will encourage traders to buy the dip.  There was talk of underdog candidates, too, before the market crashed last month. New York Magazine covered a project called SuperDAO, which was looking to raise several million dollars to purchase a Super Bowl ad of its own. It was essentially a clone of ConstitutionDAO, the failed effort to purchase a copy of the US constitution at auction.  SuperDAO failed, too, and now has its sights set on an ad for the 2023 Super Bowl.  Ghosts of the dot-com bubble  In a column for this website, my colleague David Morris wrote about the “Stadium Curse” as it may apply to crypto companies. It’s the idea that when a buzzy new company spends money on the naming rights to a sports arena, it may just be wasting its money – an act of hubris, signaling an inevitable crash.  CGMI, an investment company, had its name on what’s now Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots, for a brief moment, and the Houston Astros baseball team played full seasons at what used to be Enron Field. Both companies went bust after these investments in sports marketing.  Pets.com, one of the short-lived companies most closely associated with the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, shelled out for a Super Bowl in the year 2000. A recent article in Ad Age collects some of the other relics from that year’s “dot-com bowl,” most from startups that no longer exist.  The Hong-Kong based FTX was founded just two years ago, Binance was started in 2017, and Crypto.com is practically a dinosaur at five years old.  “I do think that it's wise for any company to take a look at how much money they're spending on marketing versus innovation at a moment in time where the ceiling for innovation just feels absolutely endless,” said Binance’s Hillmann.  There’s a chance that this year could go down similarly, as a “crypto bowl.” Maybe, with hindsight, the 2021 mania around crypto will seem quaint: This year’s ads could look like a graveyard of failed companies, each scrambling to make their mark on the culture.  There’s even a site (with a conspicuous, Antiguan web domain) offering prop bets for all the possible crypto-related content at this year’s Super Bowl. Crypto enthusiast Snoop Dogg will be among the performers at the halftime show – will he flash an NFT image on stage? Will Bud Light promote its Noun NFT during its ad? (The answer is yes, it turns out).  Again, it’s unclear how long this sort of hype will last. But at least for the time being, crypto appears to be making the most out of its bargain with professional sports.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/02/08/ads-of-the-crypto-bowl,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30eabaf5481062fd536a3575c756a3b8779bf31a-5836x3852.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This is how you can describe the qualities of buyers of ETH cryptocurrency. The second-largest cryptocurrency in daily trading volumes behaved extremely strangely at the critical level of $3000. At first, sellers easily pushed the price below this mark. Now buyers have returned the mark under their control without any problems. However, not everything is as great as in the Bitcoin market. If the BTC price broke the trend line of sellers from November 2021, the ETH price is now right next to it. https://www.tradingview.com/x/S0Ow4Do8/ Due to the fact of probable local correction of the BTC price, the probability of breaking this trend line during the current attack has decreased.

42394306,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbR2n,1644330300,Stablecoin Regulation Takes Center Stage at House Hearing Today,"Stablecoins seem to be the vector by which the U.S. will implement regulations on cryptocurrencies directly. A hearing in the House of Representatives will bring this potentially one step closer to reality.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Talking stablecoins  The narrative  The House Financial Services Committee, after holding a substantive discussion on crypto regulation broadly in December, is turning its attention to stablecoins specifically. The committee will discuss last year’s President’s Working Group report on stablecoins with one of the report’s authors, homing in on the recommendations and how they might be implemented.  Why it matters  Today’s hearing might bring us another step closer to legislation on digital assets. And as has been hinted more and more over the past year, this legislation might focus on stablecoins.  Breaking it down  The House Financial Services Committee will host a hearing on stablecoins at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time today, focusing on a report by the President’s Working Group for Financial Markets that recommends lawmakers pass a law to treat stablecoin issuers as regulated bank-like institutions.  As of press time, the sole witness will be Nellie Liang, under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department, who worked on the report.  Liang told CoinDesk in November the current regulatory framework in place does not address the potential risks posed by stablecoins, hence the report’s recommendation that Congress pass a law specifically addressing stablecoin regulation.  She reiterated her views in prepared testimony published Monday night, outlining the risks and recommendations identified in the report.  The report, published Nov. 1, 2021, recommended Congress require that stablecoins and payment stablecoin arrangements be under the jurisdiction of a federal prudential framework, such as by treating stablecoin issuers like insured depository institutions.  It also recommended that unregulated entities be barred from issuing stablecoins  “We focused on prudential risks,” Liang said last year. “We mean the risk that investors could run on a stablecoin, if they were to lose confidence in the reserve assets that are backing the stablecoin … there could be risks to the payment system because of disruption in stablecoins in how they're stored or transferred.”  Indeed, a hearing memo published Thursday night references last year’s iron titanium token run. This past June, investors sold the TITAN token en masse after concerns that it had no real liquidity. The TITAN token was part of the collateral for the IRON stablecoin. The run on TITAN led to IRON losing its peg to the U.S. dollar, falling below 70 cents within hours.  IRON did not regain its peg until September, according to CoinMarketCap.  Possible legislation  One member of the committee, Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), has begun circulating a draft discussion bill that would enact some of the recommendations from the report ahead of Tuesday’s hearing, according to Politico.  “The committee's going to be active this year on this,” he told the news outlet. “I'm hearing there's a lot of interest.""  According to the draft bill, any nonbank stablecoin issuers would have to ensure their circulating stablecoins are fully backed by reserves, and some issuers may be required to maintain more than 100% of their supply in reserves if the Treasury secretary orders it.  These reserves can only be held in U.S. dollars or securities issued by the federal government, unless the secretary allows for another reserve asset.  Moreover, these assets would have to be kept in insured accounts at a depository institution.  In suggesting these requirements, the draft bill would appear to go beyond the report’s recommendations. While the report does recommend that any legislation create a framework for federal oversight of stablecoin issuers, limited issuance and “maintenance of reserve assets,” and ensure that any framework include provisions to oversee stablecoin transactions and end users as well as issuers, the report did not mention a specific reserve requirement.  The report did specify that a federal supervisor be appointed.  Spokespeople for Gottheimer did not return requests for comment.  Ron Hammond, the director of government relations at the Blockchain Association, an industry lobbying group, tweeted that Gottheimer is not alone in how he sees the report's recommendations.  However, at the moment the bill is not being introduced by the committee itself, and is not expected to be proposed during the hearing.  The committee memo published to frame the hearing outlined the different factors under consideration today: namely, the possible risks posed by stablecoins and the regulatory gaps into which they might fall.  Defining stablecoins  The key question for lawmakers may well boil down to just how they define stablecoins for the purposes of legislation.  In a statement, outgoing Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Jelena McWilliams said stablecoins could provide faster or more efficient payment tools, but “a key question that the FDIC has been carefully exploring” is whether a stablecoin or its reserves qualify as “deposits” that could be protected by the FDIC.  “These are critical questions with major ramifications for the evolution of stablecoins,” she said. “My personal view is that, generally, bank-issued stablecoins closely resemble digital representations of deposits. I urge the FDIC to build off the work we have done and provide clarity to the public as soon as practicable, which could include promulgating amendments to the deposit insurance rules.”  In McWilliams’ view, a “one-size-fits-all approach” will not work.  The FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Reserve even mentioned stablecoins in its joint statement announcing its crypto policy goals for this year.  America COMPETES  The America COMPETES Act passed out of the House of Representatives with a handful of crypto-related provisions. The big one, which stirred backlash from the crypto industry, could have granted the U.S. Treasury secretary the ability to block crypto transactions to foreign exchanges or persons. The secretary already has this authority, but it’s subject to a 120-day public comment and rulemaking period, giving the public a chance to push back against these restrictions on a case by case basis. This provision was amended by its author, Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) prior to its passage.  The current language still specifies digital assets, but does not remove public notice period or rulemaking requirements, according to Jerry Brito, executive director at Coin Center. In other words, the Treasury secretary would still have to justify blocking any transactions rather than just having the ability to arbitrarily do so.  Another provision targets China’s digital currency plans directly, requiring the secretaries of Treasury and State to publish a report on the dollar’s role as the world reserve currency, analyzing China’s work in becoming “the world’s leading financial center” and the impact if the yuan were to replace the dollar as a global reserve currency.  The provision mentions China’s forthcoming digital yuan and research into a central bank digital currency more broadly several times as a possible risk factor.  Separately, the bill will also direct the Treasury secretary to write and publish a report analyzing cross-border payment systems, including “benefits and concerns” with the existing system. More intriguingly, the report will look at digital currencies and their possible impact.  “The report shall … review and analyze ways in which the Cross Border Interbank Payment Systems (CIPS), cryptocurrencies and foreign central bank digital currencies could erode this system,” the bill said.  Also of interest: A provision directing the National Institute for Science and Technology to research best practices and standards for digital identity management. The director of NIST is further ordered to create a technical roadmap to ultimately enable “the voluntary use and adoption of modern digital identity solutions.”  Next stop: The U.S. Senate.  Tax refunds  Last week, we saw a number of media outlets report the Internal Revenue Service is shifting its guidance on staked crypto assets. Right now these assets are taxed as income when received and potentially face a capital gains tax when they’re transacted away. A couple staking on Tezos sued the IRS last year to recoup their income taxes on claims that they shouldn’t be taxed until they dispose of the asset.  A judge ordered the parties to try and resolve the case outside of court. In December, the IRS offered a refund as part of an apparent settlement. The plaintiffs refused the refund in hopes of securing court precedent.  Several news outlets reported the refund itself as a shift in policy. I’m told that while this is a positive sign for stakers more generally, people should not be reading too much into this move yet because of the specific circumstances here. In other words – it’s cheaper to settle than to continue to litigate.  A spokesperson declined to comment when reached last week.  To be clear, the IRS could still issue guidance in line with the perceived policy shift. It just seems that at this point any assumption that it will seems premature.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Fun fact: Fed Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s first term expired, but he hasn’t yet been confirmed to his second term. As a result, he’s now Chair Pro Tempore, essentially acting chair until the Senate decides to vote on his renomination heading up the U.S. central bank.  We also now have an acting FDIC chair, after former Chair Jelena McWilliams stepped down on Friday. New Acting Chair Martin Gruenberg (naturally) mentioned that crypto “could pose significant safety and soundness and financial system risks” in his introductory statement.  Elsewhere:  Of Course It’s OK to Out the BAYC Founders: I think this is a solid take by my colleague Will Gottsegen on this weekend’s Bored Ape Yacht Club news. In brief: Buzzfeed News reporter Katie Notopoulos identified the pseudonymous founders behind Yuga Labs, the business entity that launched the BAYC NFTs. Will argues that Yuga is just like any other massive firm (it might have a $5 billion valuation) and so identifying its founders is fair play. Plus, all it took was a search of publicly available Delaware corporate records.  Tesla Records $101M Impairment Loss on Bitcoin Holdings for 2021: FASB accounting standards strike again. Tesla recorded a fairly massive loss because the value of the bitcoin it hasn’t sold dropped in value after the electric automaker put the digital asset on its balance sheet. Tesla has not yet sold the bitcoin. Should the value of the bitcoin rise, Tesla cannot report the unrealized gain. I wrote about this like a year ago and whaddya know.  Outside CoinDesk:  (The Verge) “It’s pronounced ‘neft,’” says The Verge’s Corin Faife.  (The New York Times) The Times took a look at the U.S.’ sanctions regime and how it might be used to cut Russia off from the global financial system should it invade Ukraine. It starts with the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications – aka Swift – the infrastructure underpinning global financial firms.  (The New York Times) The IRS will stop using a facial recognition platform to ID taxpayers, the Times reports. Last week, Business Insider reported the IRS was working with ID.me, a startup that would have had users upload photo IDs, selfies and Social Security numbers to identify themselves. It would then “infer citizenship.” This naturally worried people concerned with what ID.me would do with that information. At the moment, it looks like this partnership is off. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who championed changing the infrastructure bill’s crypto provision last year, called today’s news “big.”  (ProFootballTalk) This doesn’t have anything to do with crypto, and it’s like the most minor of NFL scandals from last week, but as a long-time fan of the New England Patriots I want to just take a moment to say VINDICATION!! Deflategate was a sham and turns out the NFL knew it. I just hope the league has a harder time covering up its apparent lack of coaching diversity or the Washington Commanders’ alleged egregious harassment of its employees.

The BTC price broke the global trend line, which sellers kept since November 2021. The depressive downward trend has finally broken and the chance of continuing the movement in the global consolidation of $30,000-$65,000 has increased as much as possible. The BTC price easily broke the liquidity range of $40,500-$42,000. From this range, everyone expected a price rebound, at least for local correction. But, even such buyers were not given the opportunity to organize. https://www.tradingview.com/x/ILoks3wP/ Abnormally strong growth in the BTC market can be explained by the presence of a large number of sellers. It is thanks to the open short positions of sellers who aggressively sold even at local lows that the BTC price has revived. Unfortunately, it is on the liquidation of sellers&apos; deposits and their stop orders that the Bitcoin price is now growing irretrievably. However, will it be so easy for buyers to pass the $46,000 range? In the weekly timeframes, we see that in the range of $46,000-$48,000, the price has consolidated in 5 weeks. Therefore, we doubt that the uncorrected BTC growth will continue. However, a good buying area would be the $40,500-$42,000 range. Keeping this range, buyers will prove on a large timeframe that the fall wave is over and then we are waiting for a strength test of $56,000.

42375325,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7HFp,1644328800,Pantera Leads $18M Round for Rift’s Liquidity Mining Alternative,"Rift Finance, which offers protocol-based liquidity to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), has emerged from stealth with an $18 million funding round led by Pantera Capital, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk. The valuation of the firm after the funding was not disclosed.  Other participants in the round included Coinbase Ventures, Two Sigma Ventures, Spartan Group, Defiance Capital, Hashed, Jump Capital, Vessel Capital and Morningstar Ventures.  DAOs, which are organized around a core mission and shared treasury, often issue tokens for governance and utility purposes, and also use the tokens to incentivize user deposits, a process called liquidity mining. Critics have said that liquidity mining offers imperfect incentivization and attracts temporary “farmers” who soak up the rewards and leave when the well runs dry.  Rift instead allows DAOs to deploy governance tokens from their treasuries without giving up ownership. The Rift protocol then creates liquidity pools by pairing a governance token with ether from retail and institutional depositors who receive high yield for their participation.  “Protocols have limited tools to generate sustainable liquidity for their network, which is a critical objective throughout their entire lifecycle. It has become unsustainable for projects to rely solely on liquidity mining, which is expensive and attracts mercenary capital to their ecosystem,” said Two Sigma Ventures principal Andy Kangpan in a press release. “Rift will usher in a new era for any tokenized organization looking to generate sustainable liquidity.”  Last year, Rift launched its beta product with a select group of DAOs on the Ethereum mainnet, including Fantom, Terra, Injective and Ramp. The beta reached its $50 million total value locked (TVL) cap within days.  On Tuesday, Rift opened the early access waitlist for depositors looking for high yield exposure to DAOs on the Rift ecosystem. The near-term roadmap includes plans to expand across additional layer 1 blockchains.  Rift was founded by Austin King and Tyler Tarsi. King previously founded Strata Labs, a crypto payments infrastructure company acquired by Ripple. Tarsi once built proprietary quant algorithms for institutional lending and borrowing desks at hedge funds.  Rift is among a growing number of protocols offering an alternative to liquidity mining. Stablecoin project Fei is working with protocol Ondo Finance to build a product that pairs native governance tokens with Fei stablecoins to create liquidity pools. Meanwhile, Olympus DAO, a decentralized reserve currency, has the Olympus Pro program that pairs liquidity pools with bonds.  Read more: Liquidity Mining Is Dead.

42416752,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulXxdR,1644325353,XRP Climbs 22% Amid Developments in Ripple v. SEC Case,"The XRP token used in Ripple's payments network jumped as much as 22% in 24 hours to regain a $40 billion market capitalization on Tuesday after reports suggested a positive turn for the blockchain payments firm in its court battle with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The move made it the sixth-largest cryptocurrency, taking it above Cardano's ADA token and Solana's SOL.  The price reached as high as $0.91 in early Asian trading hours, a level last seen at the start of January. The token, though, fell back 5 cents to $0.86 at the time of writing. Further resistance exists at $1 if the price holds above current levels, while support at $0.80 exists in case XRP breaks below current levels.  A relative strength index (RSI) reading of 80, however, suggests a decline can be expected in the coming days. The RSI measures the magnitude of price changes over a certain time period. Readings above 70 are considered overbought, and those below 30 indicate an asset may be oversold.  Positive SEC lawsuit proceedings  XRP's advance comes after U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York ruled that sealed documents in Ripple's court battle with the SEC over whether the token was issued and sold as an unregistered security should be opened.  Ripple founder and Chairman Chris Larsen, who had attached two memos as sealed exhibits to his motion to dismiss the SEC case, previously argued that documents sent to prospective investors in 2012 didn't refer to XRP as investment contracts or securities. The memos are said to contain information from unidentified lawyers who concluded XRP tokens weren't securities. Last week, Torres asked for the documents to be unsealed later this month.  Ripple general counsel Stuart Alderoty explained the documents’ significance in a press statement. “They will show that in 2012 Ripple received a legal analysis that XRP was not an investment contract,” Alderoty said, adding that the company will “look forward to the public having access to these documents as we continue to vigorously defend this case.”  Analysts say positive proceedings affect prices  Some analysts say those developments suggest the case is coming to an end, which could cause further appreciation in XRP's price.  “We've seen in tech history that no matter the result of the trial, verdict or closed-door agreement, supporters regularly see the ending of a legal battle as a bullish sign,” James Wo, founder and CEO of crypto investment firm DFG, said in an email to CoinDesk. ""This increase could be the beginning of a bullish period for XRP if indeed the long-lasting trial comes to an end in the upcoming months.”  Others, however, say XRP could lose favor among investors because newer payments tokens now exist in the market.  “Ripple's outlook remains questionable because market conditions have changed dramatically over the past few years,” Vladimir Gorbunov, CEO of Crypterium, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

AssangeDAO started to accept donations on Thursday and has already surpassed ConstitutionDAO, which tried to buy the U.S. Constitution at an auction.  According to its website, the DAO is a group of ""cypherpunks"" who started to form on Dec. 10, when a court in the U.K. ruled that Assange can be extradited to the U.S., where he faces 175 years in prison.  Earlier this year, the WikiLeaks founder was given the right to request the U.K. Supreme Court block his extradition to the U.S., where he would face criminal charges under the Espionage Act for his role in obtaining and publishing classified government documents.  The group will use the proceeds to bid on a non-fungible token artwork created by Assange and digital artist Pak. The piece, called ""Clock 1/1,"" is a muted clock that counts the days that Assange has spent behind bars.  The artwork proceeds will support Assange's defense through the Hamburg, Germany-based nonprofit Wau Holland Foundation, according to a Pak interview with art publication ArtNet.

Leading the charts in the past 24 hours were payment tokens XRP and Shiba Inu’s SHIB, with advances of as much as 22%.  Bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies, each added about 3% in the past 24 hours even as the tokens of layer 1, or base, blockchains Solana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT) fell 2.5%, data on analytics tool CoinGecko showed.  Among other major cryptocurrencies in the same period, Cardano’s ADA jumped 2% while binance coins (BNB) were little changed. AVAX tokens surged 10% on the back of strong fundamental activity on Avalanche, which processed more than 1 million transactions on Monday across various tools, services and products built on the network.  SHIB extended Monday's surge. The token has gained 43% from Sunday’s low of $0.000022. Tokens exchanged hands at $0.000035 in early Asian trading hours after breaking a resistance level at $0.000027 earlier this week. The tokens saw a brief sell-off as traders took profits at the $0.000035 level.  The jump came as Shiba Inu’s official Twitter account teased a possible partnership with crypto exchange Coinbase. “Hey coinbase send us a DM. Valentine's Day is approaching and we have a pending match,” the tweet read, causing prices to surge in early Asian trading hours.  Bitcoin holds above 'VWAP'  Bitcoin broke key resistance levels related to the ""volume weighted average price,"" or VWAP, a tool that calculates the average price a security has traded at throughout the day using both price and volume.  “The 2022 yearly VWAP was acting as a key resistance level,” Delphi Digital analysts wrote in a note. “With Bitcoin now trading around $42,500, the VWAP was breached convincingly on Friday after several failed breakout attempts.”  VWAP is used by traders to bid on or sell assets based on prices that provided the most volume to ensure better entries and lower slippage. In recent months, bitcoin tended to fall when it approached the VWAP levels, but has held above that level since Friday.  “The Bitcoin chart continues to paint a bullish picture,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “With the price at $45,000 on Tuesday morning, BTC is trading above the 50-day moving average just above the mid-January pivot area.  “At the same time, the RSI on the daily charts has not yet entered the overbought area, leaving room for further growth,” Kuptsikevich added.  RSI, short for relative strength index, is an indicator that measures the magnitude of price changes over a certain time period. RSI readings above 70 are considered overbought, and those below 30 indicate an asset may be oversold.  Not everyone is betting on a continued rise, however. Some traders noted that institutional activity, such as profit-taking, in traditional markets could cause a similar effect in the crypto market because various asset classes are correlated.  “Cryptocurrencies briefly stopped responding to movements in US stock indices, which started the week with a decline,” Kuptsikevich wrote. “The purchases probably included retail investors, who were driven by the desire not to miss the beginning of the market growth (FOMO),"" referring to the ""fear of missing out.""  “However, their buying potential is unlikely to be enough if stock indicators intensify their decline and large institutional investors come into play, wishing to resume profit-taking,” he said.",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC | SHIB,ADA | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/08/shiba-inus-shib-extends-surge-bitcoin-breaks-key-vwap-resistance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65558fabb2c71a7a1465e8279801bc82c2bcab26-1440x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Past Performance of DASH The DASH coin price shows the breakout of a consolidation range between the $88 and $100 marks.

The Meter Passport (MTRG) from Meter.io is a token bridge that works with Ethereum and its sidechains. The Moonriver side of the bridge was targeted in this attack. Moonriver is a smart contract platform built on the Kusama network by Polkadot. Hundred Finance is a cryptocurrency loan platform that is built on Compound Finance technology. According to a Feb. 6 announcement from the Meter team, around $4.4 million in Binance Coin (BNB) and wETH were minted through a &apos;wrong trust assumption&apos; in the code starting at 2 p.m. UTC on February 5. In this situation, an arbitrary amount of ETH was placed into Meter, and the hacker leveraged the vulnerability to mint tokens. The attack triggered a chain reaction throughout the Kusama-based Moonriver ecosystem. The attacker sold the BNB on SushiSwap, a popular decentralized exchange, after emptying Meter&apos;s BNB and wETH reserves. This resulted in a 77% drop in BNB prices on Moonriver at the moment. A handful of shrewd investors took advantage of the price drop by purchasing low-cost BNB. They utilized the tokens as collateral to get ETH, FRAX, and MIM loans via Hundred Finance. However, because of the BNB price disparity, their loans were worth more than the collateral they had given, resulting in a supply crisis.

In reality, the list of what you can buy with bitcoin is long.  With more than one-third of small businesses now accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment in the United States alone, the list of products and services you can buy with bitcoin continues growing by the day.  From large corporations like Microsoft and AT&T to places as small as your local farmer’s market stand, bitcoin’s advantages as a payment method – namely the ease of cross-border transactions, anonymity and nonreversible transactions – have been welcomed by businesses across many industries.  Here are a few common items that can be purchased with bitcoin.  Read more: How Can I Buy Bitcoin?  Things you can buy with bitcoin  Cars  While Tesla made headlines in May 2021 when company founder Elon Musk announced it would no longer be accepting bitcoin as a payment method, the used car market remains bitcoin friendly, and has been for quite some time.  BitCars is one example of an online dealership that sells luxury vehicles of all sorts, Teslas included, with its listings priced in BTC. If you ever find yourself with a need for speed, you can purchase a Lamborghini Huracan from BitCars’ site for 10 BTC. Going on a road trip? For 31.365360 BTC, you can be the owner of a Vario Perfect 1000 motorhome.  For buyers in the market for something less exotic, companies like AutoCoinCars resemble your run-of-the-mill used car dealership with plenty of modest offerings.  Real estate  Purchasing real estate with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has gone from being a novelty to a common occurrence since the first ever bitcoin property sale in 2017. In June, a Miami penthouse sold for $22.5 million in crypto, the largest sale ever paid for by virtual currency. Numerous global real estate groups now offer their listings in bitcoin as well, including:  Bithome  Caliber and Partners  Mercado Libre  In the United States, popular office-sharing provider and real estate company WeWork now accepts bitcoin as a payment method through BitPay. Crypto exchange Coinbase was the first customer to take advantage of the offering.  Sporting events  While buying game-day tickets with bitcoin is not yet commonplace in all stadiums around the U.S., certain franchises have started to pave the way for its adoption. The National Basketball Association’s Dallas Mavericks, owned by blockchain investor and entrepreneur Mark Cuban, are partnered with BitPay to accept bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency. They even offer discounted rates on merchandise you pay for with bitcoin.  Before their current season began, Major League Baseball’s Oakland A’s announced they would be selling season tickets for luxury suites at the price of 1 BTC, or its fiat equivalent. Like the Mavericks, the A’s also have made tickets and merchandise purchasable with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  The technology is being adopted for more than just sporting events. Bitcoin can also be used to buy tickets to concerts and other events held in arenas.  Art and collectibles  High-profile auction houses have started to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method on the heels of the non-fungible token boom leaking into the world of fine art. The famed Phillips auction house in Hong Kong recently listed a Banksy piece valued at between $2.82 million and $4.1 million for purchase in bitcoin and ether. The list of galleries that accept bitcoin as a payment method in the United States also continues to expand nationally, and is currently concentrated on the East and West coasts.  Maecenas allows you to buy fractional shares of famous artwork as an investment using bitcoin. In 2019, it auctioned a 31.5% share of the Andy Warhol painting, 14 Small Electric Chairs, for $1.7 million.  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?

Some hotels even allow customers to book stays with bitcoin directly using BitPay, although most still require the use of a third party to pay completely in bitcoin, which can lead to additional costs.  Private jets  Crypto-savvy travelers with deeper pockets can now fly private thanks to companies like BitLux and flyExclusive, which recently started accepting bitcoin for purchasing private jet chartering.  If you’re interested in buying your own plane outright with bitcoin, Aviatrade makes that possible, with a variety of jets listed on the site valued at tens of millions of dollars.  Web services  It intuitively makes sense that web services would be early adoptees of accepting digital currency. You can purchase a virtual private network in bitcoin through a variety of companies. Some of the most popular are ProtonVPN, Cyberghost and NordVPN.  Cloud storage is also widely available for purchase using bitcoin from companies like MEGA and Sync.  If you’re looking to host a website using bitcoin, look no further than vendors like Coin.host or Server Room. Dedicated servers start from $121.5 per month, or 0.000023 BTC.  Charity  Numerous charities have begun accepting bitcoin as a form of donation. These include popular nonprofits such as the American Red Cross, the American Cancer Society and UNICEF, as well as smaller organizations like The Water Project, Save the Children and Run 2 Rescue.  The organization Charityvest also allows you to donate to any charity using bitcoin even if it doesn’t accept cryptocurrencies directly. In 2020, $8.1 million was donated to Charityvest Funds, supporting more than 2,100 charities.  Paypal bitcoin purchases  In May, PayPal announced a new service called “Checkout with Crypto,” which allows users to make purchases using bitcoin with millions of merchants. The service converts cryptocurrency purchased through PayPal’s exchange and converts it to U.S. dollars for the merchant. At one point, it was reported that PayPal was buying up 70% of all newly minted bitcoin to make the operation possible.  While customers are unable to send money from their personal wallet to their PayPal account, the service is useful for those who use PayPal as their primary way of buying and selling bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The current rate of 1 Kazakh tenge (US$0.0023) per kilowatt of power is negligible, Tokayev said, instructing the government to increase the tax as soon as possible and to come up with a full proposal for crypto mining regulation by April 1. The tax came into effect on Jan. 1.  The new rate could be as high as 5 tenge per kWh, and miners might have to pay import taxes on their equipment, First Vice Minister of Finance Marat Sultangaziyev said, according to local media reports.  Crypto mining doesn't create many jobs and consumes high amounts of electricity, and some miners pay less for electricity than the public, the president said in a government meeting today. They also aren't taxed on imported equipment.  Crypto miners flocked to Kazakhstan after China cracked down on the industry in 2021. The central Asian country once had an electricity surplus, but since the influx the national grid has been struggling to meet demand.  The national grid operator cut off power to all mines on Jan. 21. The measure was supposed to last until the end of January, but miners told CoinDesk the electricity has yet to be restored.  The government is also trying to stamp out ""gray mining,"" meaning operations that are not properly registered and licensed.  The president tasked the Financial Monitoring Agency to identify all mining firms and check their tax and customs records by March 19.

42416756,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulXxqH,1644312385,Axie Infinity Reduces SLP Emissions to Prevent 'Collapse',"The developers behind play-to-earn protocol Axie Infinity have introduced important changes to the rewards system in an effort to create a more sustainable product for users.  The popular battle game allows players to collect, breed, battle and trade creatures called ""axies.” New players need at least three axies – costing over $1,000 to acquire – to begin playing. Players earn smooth love potion (SLP) tokens as rewards, which can then be redeemed for in-game features such as breeding new axies.  The lucrative earnings from SLP have created a so-called “economy” over the past two years and has even become the main source of income for some communities in the Philippines.  However, unlike AXS – a governance token that allows holders to take part in decisions for Axie Infinity’s future – SLP has an uncapped token supply, meaning there is no limit to how many SLP tokens could exist in the future.  This created an unsustainable environment for new players, one that even resulted in user numbers dropping. ""The Axie economy requires drastic and decisive action now or we risk total and permanent economic collapse,"" acknowledged Axie developers in a post.  The ""Season 20"" update addresses these concerns. Emission rates associated with several game features, such as “adventure mode” and “daily quest,” have been reduced to zero from over 130 million SLP earlier. This reduces the daily SLP token supply by 56%.  Players can earn SLP tokens through “area combat,” a turn-based card minigame on Axie Infinity. SLP used to breed or update axies will be burned, or destroyed permanently, which would additionally lower the token’s circulating supply.  SLP prices fell 93% from all-time highs  SLP emissions earlier caused a drastic plunge in the token’s prices. Earlier this month, prices fell 94% to $0.01 from July’s highs of $0.39. The market capitalization, however, increased to $312 million from $166 million in the same period as supply continued to increase.  SLP prices have surged 100% in the past week following the update, data from analytics tool CoinGecko showed.  AXS prices fell alongside. The governance tokens traded at $48 last week after falling nearly 60% from the November highs of $157. However, the Season 20 update revived AXS as prices bounced over the weekend, reaching $66 at the time of writing.  Meanwhile, some in crypto circles said Axie’s decision showcased the impact of token-based games.  “Axie's SLP token is based on a unique combination between game economy and token economy,” said Asaf Naim, CEO of blockchain technology firm Kirobo in an email to CoinDesk. “Finding a sweet spot between inflation and deflation of this asset in this multi-layered structure is a very complex task, and Axie seems to have found it (for now).”  They are obligated to do so to protect SLP holders and to ensure that the platform maintains its lucrative nature. But as this synergy between gaming and crypto grows, token economists will have to constantly be vigilant and react to the changing landscape,” Naim added.",NEGATIVE,AXS,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/08/axie-infinity-reduces-slp-emissions-to-prevent-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0cb5fd7843df6068ca6e6e8de708e67a88d32f60-8164x6123.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the newspaper, the judgment is now due by March 31, two months later than scheduled. According to a representative for the NYSDEC, the delay will allow the agency to finish its evaluation with public input. In a comprehensive letter dated December 2, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) questioned the environmental impact of Greenidge Generation&apos;s (GREE) bitcoin mining operation in New York. The senator went after six additional crypto miners, challenging their energy consumption. Greenidge announced on January 16 that the business had temporarily halted bitcoin mining activities in Dresden, the day before owing to increased electricity demand caused by recent cold weather. This was done in order to supply the New York Independent System Operator with all of its electrical generation capability. Last year, the miner requested to renew the plant&apos;s licenses.
