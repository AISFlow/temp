42425783,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJ5h,1403560843,Minnesota Senator to Spearhead Bitcoin Public Awareness Effort,"A Minnesota senator is leading the latest effort to bring bitcoin and its benefits to the global public through a new bitcoin-focused non-profit called yesbitcoin.  Described as a consumer-facing organization with worldwide ambitions, yesbitcoin has announced a strategic communications effort aimed at advancing bitcoin through advertising and merchant-adoption efforts.  Republican Senator Branden Petersen, the Executive Director and founder of yesbitcoin, spoke to CoinDesk about how his organisation aims to achieve this goal.  In the interview, Petersen compared the program to American Express commercials – but for bitcoin:  ""We're communicating in laypersons' nomenclature which has been difficult for business owners to do in a way that conveys the real value that bitcoin has and the way that it can make everybody's life better.""  Petersen went on to state that, while the decentralized nature of bitcoin has a lot of benefits, it presents a ""unique communications challenge"" to those looking to popularize it with global consumers.  Yesbitcoin, he said, aims to fill that void, becoming the ""community conduit for consumer-facing communications in general"".  Petersen has been in the Minnesota Senate since 2012 and represents District 35, the northwest Anoka County region. Education policy reform and citizen data privacy protections are among his legislative accomplishments.  Emphasizing education  Bitcoin evangelists often say that the biggest challenge to bitcoin adoption is educational in nature – a belief that can be seen even in the actions of the ecosystem's major businesses. For example, BitPay made the decision last week to brand the NCAA playoff football game it will sponsor as the 'Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl', forgoing using its own name in the title.  Bitcoin has seen similar initiatives in the political sphere, with Falcon Global Capital recently hiring lobbyists to advocate for bitcoin on Capitol Hill.  This activity is encouraging to Petersen, who sees his own efforts in line with this trend. ""The political establishment is behind the marketplace on all things bitcoin,"" he said. ""It's been somewhat encouraging to see some champions out there.""  Bitcoin in US politics  The news of Petersen's involvement in the bitcoin ecosystem comes at a time when a number of current, former and aspiring US politicians have come out in favor of bitcoin, either through public endorsement or by accepting BTC for campaign donations.  Current US Congressman Jared Polis recently spoke at length to CoinDesk about his enthusiasm for bitcoin and digital currencies, suggesting he will look to block any uninformed policies while he remains in Washington DC.  For more on Polis and his stance on bitcoin, read our most recent interview.

42425781,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJ3h,1403544348,Canada Amends National Law to Regulate Bitcoin Businesses,"The Parliament of Canada has passed a bill that amends the country's Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act of 2000 to extend to both foreign and domestic businesses working in the bitcoin and digital currency sectors in Canada.  Bill C-31, known formally as ""An Act to Implement Certain Provisions of the Budget Tabled in Parliament on February 11, 2014"", has potentially far-reaching implications for all bitcoin businesses currently serving the Canadian market, and was first introduced in March.  On 19th June, it received Royal Assent, thereby officially becoming law, though additional approval will be needed before the regulation can be enforced.  The amendment does not name bitcoin directly, but rather refers to businesses ""dealing in virtual currencies"". Members of Canadian bitcoin ecosystem have reached out for formal clarification. However, previous discussion of the bill by the country’s then finance minister Jim Flaherty suggests the measures are indeed intended to cover bitcoin.  Once enforced, the law would regulate bitcoin businesses as money services businesses (MSBs), a determination that would impose record keeping, verification procedures, suspicious transaction reporting and registration requirements on bitcoin businesses seeking to engage its citizens in digital currency-related financial services.  The text of the amended law reads:  ""Division 19 of Part 6 amends the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to, among other things, enhance the client identification, record keeping and registration requirements for financial institutions and intermediaries, refer to online casinos, and extend the application of the Act to persons and entities that deal in virtual currencies and foreign money services businesses.""  Additionally, bitcoin businesses would be required to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) and face restrictions if they fail to do so.  Christine Duhaime  , a Canada-based financial crime and certified anti-money laundering (AML) specialist, wrote in her assessment that bitcoin entities could be prohibited from traditionally opening bank accounts if they are not registered with FINTRAC.  Duhaime told CoinDesk:  ""[The law applies to] bitcoin businesses in Canada providing services to Canadians, but it also applies to ones outside of Canada targeting Canadians ... For bitcoin businesses outside Canada, the correspondent banking relationships will apply, meaning that banks anywhere basically will have to make sure that when they're providing bitcoin services that those bitcoin services are compliant with the law in Canada.""  Amber Scott, vice president of AML at Canadian consultancy Bitcoin Strategy Group, further explained:  ""This will affect anyone serving Canadian customers in Canada. For example, if you're a Dutch company offering ATMs in Holland, and I as a Canadian buy BTC from an ATM in Holland, there's no impact. But, if the same company offers an online exchange and I access that exchange from Canada, they're captured under the law.""  Scott added: ""The penalties for non-compliance can be fairly significant. In addition to the financial implication, the regulator also has the ability to publish the names of companies found to be in violation (which is generally the kiss of death as far as maintaining or establishing any banking relationships).""  The measures are part of a wide-ranging bill meant to strengthen the country's domestic AML policies and terrorist financing efforts.

42425794,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJRh,1403539527,OKCoin Adds Algorithmic Trading Tools to Attract High-Volume Investors,"China-based bitcoin exchange OKCoin has announced the introduction of new algorithmic trading tools designed to give its international investors more control over high-volume market activities.  As part of the rollout, the Beijing-based company has launched three new features meant to eliminate pain points common to these larger orders:  Icebergs – which allow large volume orders to be subdivided into many smaller orders  Modified time-weighted average price orders – designed to combat the price slippage that can result from large trades  Trigger orders – which give users more control over conditions for trading  Increasing sophistication  OKCoin  CEO Star Xu framed the service launch as one that would better position the exchange to compete domestically and internationally for sophisticated investors, stating:  “By bringing professional trading technologies from the traditional financial world, OKCoin hopes to boost the growth and maturity of bitcoin trading. Bitcoin trading is still in its infancy, historically­ speaking, but many of the investors involved are quite sophisticated.""  The company credited the product launch to the efforts of Changpeng Zhao, the company's Chief Technology Officer and a former senior executive at Blockchain.  Zhao, who is also a former Head of Research and Development for Bloomberg Tradebook Futures, went on to suggest that OKCoin may be seeking to continue to harness his previous experience as it seeks to expand its services, explaining:  ""I am excited that I can leverage my Wall Street experience directly at OKCoin, and I see many opportunities for the company to fill gaps and shortfalls within the bitcoin trading ecosystem.""  International appeal  The launch comes just days after OKCoin reintroduced its peer-to-peer (P2P) margin trading services, and further follows the introduction of its English-language website.  Both launches seem to frame OKCoin as a global bitcoin exchange that extends beyond the regulatory uncertainty common to its host country.  This viewpoint was also hinted at by Xu, who avoided using China-specific language when discussing the product launch. Xu said:  ""OKCoin is committed to the continued enhancement of our trading tools and service offerings, and we will not stop until our platform offers all of the same trading services and options that one might expect from world-­leading financial exchanges.""  Targeting slippage  Bitcoin's institutional investors have recently noted that current exchange trading solutions are not optimised for high net-worth clients.  For example, Binary Financial's Managing Partner Harry Yeh recently told CoinDesk that the upcoming US Marshals Service (USMS) auction of nearly 30,000 bitcoins confiscated from Silk Road has become appealing to his firm's clients for providing a viable solution to real investor concerns.  Yeh explained how large buyers often pay an above-market price for large bitcoin orders, as the act of buying such a large volume of coins causes price slippage, whereby investors force the price of bitcoin to rise as their orders are being filled.  Should OKCoin's service provide a solution, Yeh's comments suggest that they may help the exchange connect with a valuable and underserved niche in the bitcoin community.

42425789,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgJFh,1403535683,Could Jersey Rival Bali as the Next Bitcoin Island?,"Following a recent initiative aiming to transform the Indonesian island of Bali into a 'Bitcoin Paradise', an advocacy group in the British Crown dependency of Jersey has announced similar plans to develop a 'Bitcoin Isle'.  Bit.coin.je  hopes that by encouraging businesses adoption and promoting a bitcoin-friendly regulatory environment, Jersey could become a vital hub for the digital currency, bringing together the island's highly-developed finance industry with its burgeoning digital sector.  Robbie Andrews, co-founder of the campaign group, told CoinDesk:  ""We feel that Jersey is perfectly positioned to become a cryptocurrency-friendly jurisdiction. We've got a very highly-regarded finance industry with world class AML/KYC expertise. Although not part of either, we're located between the UK and the EU with good communication links to both.""  Andrews added that Jersey's high percentage of smartphone ownership and forthcoming 4G connectivity, alongside its ""lean and nimble"" approach to regulation, could facilitate rapid adoption of a cashless payment mechanism like bitcoin.  Bit.coin.je is also aiming to make it easier for locals to purchase bitcoin with a Lamassu ATM, which the organisation hopes will launch within the next few weeks.  Promoting bitcoin  Andrews has been interested in cryptocurrencies since 2010 and has encouraged further discussion and education on the subject with various public, business and government sessions on the island.  Along with colleague Jon Day, he formed a community portal and organised a fortnightly bitcoin meetup to both bring together interested individuals and businesses and to create an environment for those wanting to learn more about digital currencies.  This all led to the pair founding Bit.coin.je, to campaign for bitcoin in Jersey on a higher level. ""Being able to gather these parties and communicate as a single voice is something we've already seen benefits from,"" he said.  Recent initiatives by the States of Jersey-funded body Digital Jersey have led to traditional local industries realising that bitcoin isn't something that can be ignored.  ""The various bodies and departments that we've dealt with have been extremely receptive to learning more about [bitcoin] and have made some very proactive steps to looking how it could work with the existing regulations,"" explained Andrews.  Jersey's Treasury and Resources Minister, Senator Philip Ozouf has recently indicated that he also believes bitcoin business would be good for the island, telling the BBC:  ""[This] is a sector that could hold significant opportunities for Jersey [...] We are keen to support local businesses by helping to create a well-regulated and responsive environment for investment in the sector.""  The other bitcoin isle  Recently, another of Britain's three Crown dependencies announced similar plans to encourage bitcoin business.  The Isle of Man's Financial Supervision Commission indicated in March that bitcoin exchanges holding client funds with a licenced overseas payment service provider are not required to obtain a licence for their business activities.  Furthermore, the island was said to be considering changes to legislation that would see bitcoin businesses in the jurisdiction be allowed access to at least two of its specialised banks.  More recently, a group of Isle of Man businesses launched a decentralized incubator for digital currency startups.  “This is the biggest opportunity for the Isle of Man since gaming moved here. Bitcoin may be the digital currency of the future or it may not, but we are the ideal place for the technology to call home,” said R. Paul Davis, general counsel at Counting House, one of the service providers.

42377423,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70a2z,1403523508,Why XPRIZE Founder Peter H Diamandis is Swapping Gold for Bitcoin,"Peter H Diamandis, the founder and Chairman of the XPRIZE Foundation, has given bitcoin his blessing, describing it as a globally important and disruptive technology.  In a blog post, Diamandis wrote that bitcoin is finally moving from its ""deceptive phase to a very disruptive phase"". He made a compelling argument, outlining positive developments in the bitcoin ecosystem and the evolution of his own opinion on the matter.  Diamandis said he has been tracking bitcoin since its inception and his confidence has grown to such an extent that he is even trading in a portion of his gold holdings for bitcoin.  The XPRIZE Foundation has been around since 1995, with the stated goal of promoting emerging technologies through public competitions and initiatives.  The foundation’s board of trustees includes big names like PayPal co-founder Elon Musk, President of the Huffington Post Media Group Arianna Huffington, and Google co-founder Larry Page.  Changing the way we think of money  Diamandis explained the basic properties of bitcoin and made a bold claim: he believes bitcoin will do for money what email did for communications.  He said:  “At its core, bitcoin is a smart currency, designed by very forward-thinking engineers. It eliminates the need for banks, gets rid of credit card fees, currency exchange fees, money transfer fees, and reduces the need for lawyers in transitions... all good things. Most importantly, it is an 'exponential currency' that will change the way we think about money. Much the same way email changed the way we thought of mail.”  Diamandis further pointed out that bitcoin is following 'the six Ds' – it is digitised, deceptive, disruptive, dematerialising, demonetising and democratising. Currently, he believes bitcoin is currently in the process of entering the disruptive phase.  Five phases of adoption  Diamandis borrowed from Second Market founder Barry Silbert when explaining the various phases of digital currency development.  Phase 1 was the deceptive, experimental phase, from 2009 to 2011. Phase 2, starting in 2011, marks the beginning of the early adopter phase. Phase 3, 2012 through mid-2014, is described as the beginning of the venture capital phase.  Diamandis says we are in the middle of Phase 3:  ""We are right in the middle of Phase 3 right now. Thousands of bitcoin companies are getting funding. Many of these are trying to create the 'User-Interface Moment'.  Next, between fall 2014 and 2015, Diamandis expects to see the start of Phase 4, described as the Wall Street Phase, which will be marked by “institutional money acknowledging digital currencies as an asset class”.  Phase 5 is mass global consumer adoption, which Diamandis and Silbert believe is just one to two years away.  Call for experimentation  Diamandis believes people need to get out there and start experimenting with bitcoin.  “Learn, do, teach... Go experiment! Create a bitcoin wallet and buy some bitcoin. There is no better way to learn than by doing,” he concluded.  Slightly confusingly, in his post, he mistakenly names merchant processor BitPay as a bitcoin exchange.  Diamandis concluded by mentioning his plans to discuss the digital currency in more detail via his Abundance 360 Community, which describes itself as ""a group of entrepreneurs passionate about generating extraordinary wealth while creating a world of abundance"".
