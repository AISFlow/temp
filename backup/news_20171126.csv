42400692,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKQUb,1511704836,Ex-SEC Lawyer Predicts 'Assembly Line' for ICO Enforcement,"The Securities and Exchange Commission could be gearing up to drop major actions on issuers of initial coin offerings (ICOs).  According to Nicolas Morgan, a former lawyer for the U.S. government agency tasked with regulating the securities industry, the SEC is likely to roll out a sort of ""assembly line"" of enforcement actions against the nascent industry in the coming years.  While the SEC has issued guidance to the ICO industry, recently laying out why it classified tokens issued by The DAO (a now-defunct ethereum smart contract that sold its token to investors) as securities, the agency has yet to announce formal rules.  In response, the industry has moved in a different direction. Some, such as Overstock subsidiary tZERO, are deciding to get regulated, while others have moved to create utility for their tokens, thereby establishing it as a resource necessary for software products.  But according to Morgan, and others in the industry, the ever-expanding language and group of terms and techniques the industry uses could still expose entrepreneurs to a time-consuming SEC investigation and litigation.  ""You might be right that your ICO is not a security, and some judge, at the end of the day, may agree with you, but is it worth the expense and distraction to get that answer from a judge?"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It's probably a better course of action if you're anywhere close to being a security, to just assume that it is and go forward with that presumption in mind.""  Recently speaking at the ICO Forward Summit in New York City, Morgan, who served about seven years in the SEC's enforcement division, spoke to CoinDesk about what to watch for in terms of SEC enforcement in the coming years.  This interview has been edited and condensed.  CoinDesk: At what point will the SEC and others weigh in more formally on ICOs?  Morgan: You're not going to get a satisfactory answer that [your token is] not a security until the end of the SEC investigation process, in litigation, when you might get a judge that agrees with you that your ICO is not a security.  But it doesn't even necessarily have to be at trial; a trial happens at the end of a legal proceeding. For example, in the Zaslavskiy case – the diamonds and real estate ICO in Brooklyn, New York – the SEC had to go into court, they filed a complaint, they [effectively] said ""this token is a security.""  Then they got a preliminary ruling from the judge in that case that indicated that it probably was a security. That's as close as we've gotten to a ruling by a judge.  Or take the Tezos class action, as another example: private lawsuit, filed in San Francisco state court. Not the SEC.  The plaintiffs and their lawyers have alleged that [Tezo's ICO] involves a security. I have a feeling the very first line of defense by the defendants will be, ""This is not a security. These particular laws don't apply."" But no judge has ruled on it.  We don't have judicial rulings on this, and we won't have them for probably several months.  What does a startup need to do if it wants to proceed as if its token is a security, then?  If you're proceeding on the assumption that you have a security and you want to have an ICO, the first thing is to decide whether you're going to offer the tokens on a registered basis or pursuant to an exemption to registration. That's probably the first issue that needs to be confronted.  Then there is: How will your sales and efforts selling ICOs or tokens be judged in hindsight? Use of proceeds is probably the biggest single representation to potential investors that will be scrutinized by regulators or private plaintiffs after the fact.  The use of proceeds has to be accurate. So that's step one.  Step two: If you're going to tout the qualifications of your board of advisors, make sure they actually are advisors and have agreed to be listed as such. And make sure when you're describing either your advisors or your management, that the descriptions are accurate, not exaggerated.  Those things will be scrutinized.  A third thing is how you're describing what it is you're going to do. Not in terms of how the money is going to be spent, but, ""We have certain milestones. We are going to launch this platform by January."" Well, if you say that, and January comes and goes and no launch has happened, that may be an issue.  Be careful how you characterize what you do operationally.  In your ""assembly line"" reference – where the SEC assesses tokens and takes some into investigation on a rolling basis – how this would work?  Models that might be a good analogy ... one was a particular model in the PIPES market.  PIPES is an acronym for private investment in public equities, and it was a way for hedge funds and other investors to invest generally in small publicly traded companies through a private offering. It's still around.  But the SEC latched on to a particular model, where the hedge funds would sometimes short the company's stock simultaneously with purchasing in the PIPE.  The enforcement folks saw this going on. They didn't like it; they thought it was a violation of law. And they sent these subpoenas out by the dozens.  The SEC developed a model where they saw the same fact pattern over and over again, where they would send out the subpoenas, check to see that fact pattern existed and then very quickly brought a lawsuit against companies. And so I can see that happening here.  We see an ICO, it pretty obviously falls into the realm of a security, in that they put out a white paper, they didn't have a registration statement, they didn't fit into an exemption to the registration requirements. So, let's send out a subpoena.  And if the fact patterns recur over and over again, it makes it pretty easy for the SEC, that's why I described it as an assembly line. Something that's not automated, but it's easily replicated on their side.  Do you think the SEC will come out with more formal guidance soon?  So, you see it a couple of different ways. You see it in something like the DAO report. That's called a 21(a) report, because the report is issued under a certain section of the law.  The other way the SEC communicates is through speeches, public comments. We're also going to see No Action letters, so you can go and basically ask a very specific question: ""If we do this, will you agree not to recommend an action be brought against us?""  And then the absolute least effective way the SEC speaks is by bringing lawsuits. We're going to see more of those.  You can tell what the SEC's thinking because they allege it in a complaint they file in federal court or bring in an administrative proceeding. That's a tough way to regulate, by litigation, but that's going to happen too.  There are those in the ICO space who would prefer the SEC promulgate some regulations. I think that's likely to happen also. They've got a lot on their plate that has nothing to do with ICOs, and the rulemaking process is a slow process.  So that's why we may see the so-called regulation by litigation happen more immediately.  If rules came along, would the SEC grandfather in projects operating before those rules were formalized?  No. I don't think they would.  Will all the fumbling with language, such as companies using ""token"" versus ""coin"" in their marketing, be effective?  The economic reality matters far more than the label. Tezos may be the test case on that, because they tried to call it a ""donation.""  But it's the economic reality, not the label, that's the most critical issue.  How is the SEC doing, in your mind, investigating and regulating the industry? Does anything about the way regulation will be laid down worry you?  The DAO was a pretty obvious call as far as whether it was a security or not. I think that was good that the SEC did that, but it doesn't go far enough.  They should put out pronouncements about tokens that are a closer call. And they will. They'll get there. It will be in the form of No Action letters and rule-making.  I don't disagree with the SEC's approach.  What I'm anticipating disagreeing with is that I think the enforcement division is going to bring some cases where they just assume it's a security, but where the defense may have a legitimate argument that it's not a security.  I fear that the SEC will, in an effort to really make a point, bring cases where the existence of a security does not get the consideration that it really deserves, because there will be other bad factors in these cases. Fraud, theft of money, whatever it is.  So we won't get the development of the law that we should. There won't be the nuanced thinking about whether a security exists, because there will be other facts that overshadow that issue.

42400688,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKQPg,1511700316,Who Invented Pants? Why Crypto Creators' Identities Don't Matter,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and the former editor-in-chief of financial industry publication American Banker.  The following opinion piece originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.      For all we know, the first cave-dweller to rub two sticks together was a misogynist. Or maybe just a mean person. Even if so, fire is still useful for cooking and warmth.  To use more concrete examples, Richard Wagner and Henry Ford were nasty anti-Semites. But we can still appreciate the beauty of the Ring Cycle and the efficiency of the assembly line.  In other words, the identity or character of the creator has little, if any, bearing on the value of the creation.  That's why the mainstream media's obsession a few years ago with unmasking Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of bitcoin, was so silly. We've seen what bitcoin does, we know how it works, the code is public. The focus on its author would be laughable if it weren't also destructive.  A circus and a distraction  Quite apart from doxxing poor old Dorian Nakamoto and rewarding Craig Wright with the limelight, these circuses distracted public attention from the much more interesting questions about money and society raised by Satoshi's work and by the projects it inspired.  Questions like: Why did it still take days to transfer money between bank accounts when an unknown geek had demonstrated that value could be zapped across the globe in minutes? Could capital controls still work in the age of the internet (if they ever did) – and if not, is that really a bad thing? And what do you mean, I don't actually own the stocks in my portfolio?  But far too many people in my profession are less interested in engaging with big ideas than in talking about other people. As President Trump would say: Sad!  Yet, this is one more way bitcoin opens up new vistas. When you spend time exploring the rabbit hole of cryptocurrency, it inevitably gets you thinking about identity – when it's important, when it isn't and why.  To be sure, there are times when knowing someone's identity is helpful, even critical. Businesses often need to know something about their customers to guard against fraud or assess credit risk, for example. Some scam artist has recently been impersonating CoinDesk and sending phishing texts with our name on it to people in the Netherlands – now there's someone who deserves to be unmasked (along with other consequences).  But there are other times when identity can serve to cloud people's judgment. And not even the bitcoin community has been immune to this problem.  Pseudonymous BIPs  In a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) submitted in March, as the scaling debate was heating up, Chris Stewart, co-founder of SuredBits, described the danger:  ""We are seeing the politicization of protocol level changes. The critiques of these changes are slowly moving towards critiques based on who is submitting the BIP – not what it actually contains. This is the worst thing that can happen in a meritocracy.""  To address this, Stewart proposed requiring BIPs to be submitted pseudonymously. ""This means a BIP can be proposed and examined based on its technical merits,"" he wrote.  And if a developer wanted to claim credit after a BIP was accepted, Stewart included a way for them to cryptographically prove authorship – preempting another Craig Wright-style drama.  In a conversation a few weeks ago, when the Segwit2x fork was still expected to happen and bitcoin tribalism had reached a fever pitch, Stewart gave another reason why technologists might want their ideas to be discussed without attribution.  ""I think more people need to be conscious of their online persona – it can have dire consequences,"" Stewart told me, citing as an example the recent ""swatting"" of a prominent bitcoin engineer. ""I'm guessing anyone that is a strong persona in this space is getting a lot of harassment.""  So the next time someone asks you who you think Satoshi is, don't indulge in gossipy parlor games.  Instead, make them think by answering with a question: ""Who invented pants?""
