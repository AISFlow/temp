42426308,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJM69h,1425925823,Bitcoin Social Network ZapChain Launches Micropayments Tool,"Bitcoin-centric social network ZapChain is once again enabling micropayments with the launch of a new in-house tipping mechanism.  The announcement finds ZapChain furthering its attempts to experiment with content monetization, following Coinbase’s decision to end its tipping service in February.  Company CEO Matt Schlicht asserted the move toward micropayments was inspired by the lack of available venues for consumers to have introductory experiences with bitcoin, while ZapChain investor and Boost VC CEO Adam Draper spoke to the big picture behind the company’s vision for content monetization.  Draper said:  ""Microtransactions might be a new way for web content creators to make money. It could be a game changer.""  ZapChain users will now see a green 'Tip' button beside both questions and comments. By clicking this button, users are prompted to send bits, or units of bitcoins, to other users – be it someone who has asked a question or someone who has provided an answer.  The tip amounts are pre-set to represent items such as a coffee, an apple or a pizza.  ZapChain said it is not currently seeking to make a profit from the tool, but suggested it may be looking to allow other platforms to integrate the product.  The tool was built on Blockcypher's API, allowing all tipping transactions to be conducted on the bitcoin blockchain.

The private company, which currently supplies almost 30,000 households and SMEs, has partnered with BitPay to accept payments in the digital currency.  Maarten De Cuyper, CEO at Elegant, said:    ""We have been innovative in our product offering and customer contact. With this in mind, accepting bitcoins is not so strange – we are happy to be the first mover in Belgium.""            Once registered for bitcoin payments, users will automatically receive a BitPay link with their monthly electricity or gas invoice.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Thomas Goemaere, one of the consumers who requested the bitcoin payment option, said:    ""I am very happy about this. My goal is to live without a bank account as soon as possible. I am still far from that, but the electricity invoice is an important part of my monthly budget, so that's a big step forward for me.""    ""Bitcoin is still quite alien in Belgium. However, Elegant is a wonderful add-on to Mobile Vikings, a mobile phone operator and pizza.be, an online pizza delivery service, that promote and accept the currency,"" he added.  De Cuyper said that the company had already registered two bitcoin payments, despite the fact the new offering hadn't yet been publicised.

42398247,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT17G,1425910528,Markets Weekly: Bitcoin Price Holds Firm Following Volume Growth,"The bitcoin price has continued to build on recent gains, adding $15 over the last week. This represents a 6% increase over the opening price on 2nd March, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index.  The week's biggest intra-day price swing happened early in the week, when bitcoin hit a high of $286.28, representing a gain of $19.24 from the day's low.  Trading sessions ended in positive territory on four consecutive days, from the end of the previous week and into the first days of the week just passed. Some $50 separated the daily low at the start of the sessions and the high at the end, on 3rd March.  Volume growth  Bitcoin price gains were supported by strong volume growth. Some 3.67 million coins changed hands on the week ended 7th March, which was a 55% increase over the previous seven-day period.  Big volume gains came from Bitfinex and Bitstamp, which saw spikes of 106% and 54% respectively. Chinese exchanges Huobi and OKCoin also recorded significant increases of 95% and 83%.  BTC China  still leads the mainland Chinese exchanges on volume traded, just barely beating OKCoin in last week's trading activity. Bitfinex continues to dominate trading outside the mainland.  Notably, Coinbase's exchange, launched in January, continues to see more coins changing hands than the ex-market leader, Bitstamp.  Newsflow this week was relatively calm. One significant event was the US Marshals Service's third bitcoin auction, which saw more bidders take part than its last sale in December. But the number of bidders – 14 in all – remains significantly lower than the 45 who took part in the inaugural sale in June.  Another news event that could have added to positive bitcoin price sentiment was the US banking regulator's remarks that digital currencies could be ""revolutionary"" for the global financial system, delivered to an audience of financiers at the Institute of International Bankers.  Waiting for serious liquidity  Market-watchers were still chattering about the Bitcoin Investment Trust's regulatory approval, which was announced last week. Arthur Hayes at derivatives exchange BitMEX teased out the nuances of the BIT offering in his weekly newsletter, calling it an ""ETF Halfway House"" rather than a true exchange-traded fund offering. The latter, such as the planned Winklevoss ETF, could bring a firehose of liquidity to the bitcoin markets.  When BIT begins trading in the US over-the-counter markets, it will only bring liquidity to existing holders of BIT units. These holders will be able to sell their units on the newly accessible OTC markets.  However, the trust will only directly contribute to increased bitcoin demand and liquidity if the trust creates new units for its members, an act that's hampered by the fact that its members are limited to wealthy, 'accredited' investors.  By contrast, the Winklevoss ETF will link demand for its units directly to demand for actual bitcoins. Each ETF share will be worth 0.2 BTC upon listing, coins which are actually held by the Winklevoss fund. New units can be created daily, an act that will require more coins to be deposited with the trust.  Hayes summed it up:  ""BIT will have a negligible effect on liquidity and a proper ETF will have a massive impact.""  While the BIT approval is a big step for the bitcoin markets, therefore, the real wave of liquidity required to shore up the price will only come when the Winklevoss fund – or another, more nimble issuer – hits the markets.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/09/markets-weekly-bitcoin-price-holds-firm-following-volume-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/65ecc7e9274277a043040768266c5522cfe64b67-1500x833.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398244,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT14J,1425906272,Why Wiper Added Bitcoin to Its Disappearing Chat App,"Messaging could be the logical starting point for digital currency adoption, according to the CEO of bitcoin-enabled chat app Wiper.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Manlion Carelli praised bitcoin's ""amazing"" promise but said the currency remains difficult for beginners to use. ""Wiper's goal is to make it more accessible to even first time smartphone users, so that its promise can be realised,"" he added.  Launched in 2014, Wiper is part of a new wave of ephemeral messaging services that allow users to erase, or 'wipe' their conversations. The app also offers encrypted messages and phone calls, music streaming and, as of February, an embedded bitcoin wallet.  Once they've opted in, any Wiper user can send bitcoin to and receive bitcoin from their contacts within the app. Though Wiper would not disclose exactly how many wallets have been opened so far, Carelli said he has been particularly pleased with the response from Wiper's asian user base.  How it works  Wiper uses a client-side wallet, meaning that its servers are not involved in the storage, sending or receiving of bitcoin. Instead, these operations are handled by the user's device.  Each user can secure and restore their wallet with a deterministic key, a randomly-generated string of words that can be written down and stashed somewhere safe.  ""Consumers can use the deterministic key to restore their wallet on a new device, if they loose their phone or get a new one,"" said Carelli, adding that ""the awesome thing for Wiper users is when it comes to backing up their wallet, their life is radically simplified"".  Unlike other messaging apps that offer payment functionality, Wiper reaches users without a bank account or debit card.  ""Snapchat enabled users to send each other money through its integration with a payments company. But users on each side of the transaction require a debit card linked to MasterCard or Visa,"" said the CEO.  Wiper won't take a cut of bitcoin transactions either, Carelli confirmed:  ""There is a tiny mining fee paid into the bitcoin ecosystem which is typical of bitcoin transactions and goes to the miners for speeding up a transaction, but none of that fee goes to Wiper.""  Future plans  With smartphone usage on the rise, Carelli thinks bitcoin has potential to provide access to financial tools for the 2.5 billion people that are currently unbanked.  ""How do you purchase bitcoin? Where can you spend it or convert it to local currency? Wiper is working on simplifying the answers to these questions.""  The CEO said that his company's mission was ""to bring this amazing new tool to mainstream users around the world"", adding that the embedded wallet and sending and receiving functions are the foundation for Wiper to ""build a complete solution to making bitcoin an everyday tool"".  When asked about the messaging service's focus on anonymity, he confirmed that privacy would continue to be an important element, adding that Wiper had ""been architected so that it can later support multiple currencies"".  ""Stay tuned,"" he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/09/why-wiper-added-bitcoin-to-its-disappearing-chat-app,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1448908e5804f5f020a7694608a904f0e274373f-1500x1000.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
