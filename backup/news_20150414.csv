42426324,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMPhh,1429046117,Bitcoin Marketplace Brawker to Shut Down,"Bitcoin buying service Brawker has announced that it will close its doors at the end of April, citing competition and workload issues.  The news, made public in a 14th April blog post, comes soon after the departure of former CEO Cyril Houri, who left following a management shakeup earlier this month. The decentralized platform, launched in April of last year, enabled consumers to purchase products with bitcoin.  Gabriel Majoulet, CTO at Brawker, told CoinDesk:  ""We did not meet our objectives, and the general idea behind the project is not as effective as it was 18 months ago. Buying bitcoin with credit cards is now possible, and more and more merchants are accepting digital currencies.""  He suggested that the Brawker team will continue working on bitcoin initiatives. ""We want to move on to the next project and start working on something that's more useful to the community,"" he said.  Majoulet confirmed that user transactions would be completed before the service went offline. Brawker is no longer accepting new orders, he added.

42426315,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMPPh,1429045491,Jed McCaleb Talks Stellar's New Protocol for Consensus,"The Stellar Foundation has released details about the new consensus protocol it hopes to deploy on the Stellar network as early as this summer.  Founded on a concept called federated Byzantine agreement, the Stellar Consensus Protocol is intended to replace Stellar's existing consensus protocol, itself is based on the system used by competitor Ripple Labs. The Stellar team said in December that it was working to replace its existing protocol following network issues last September.  The Stellar Foundation, the organization that oversees the development of the Stellar network, published the code for the protocol alongside a white paper by Stanford University researcher and Stellar Foundation chief scientist Professor David Mazieres.  Founder Jed McCaleb said in an interview that the protocol and associated white paper have been in development for months. The goal of the release, he said, was to both provide analytical backing for the new protocol as well as give less technology inclined individuals the means to understand the new technology.  McCaleb explained that work on the new protocol was based on the intention to build a scalable, decentralized system, noting:  “From the beginning, we were trying to design it to be able to reach hundreds of millions of accounts, thousands of transactions. So we’ve stress tested to 100 million accounts and a few hundred transactions per second, and its holding up under those loads.""  The formal announcement coincided with the release of an introductory guide and the first chapter of a “graphic novel” that takes place in a fictional galaxy occupied by aliens seeking a new way to conduct interplanetary payments.  The general's problem  Byzantine agreement refers to the Byzantine General's Problem, which compares the issue nodes face when seeking to discern whether to trust one another to a group of military leaders receiving potentially false information from messengers during the siege of a city.  Byzantine agreement frameworks establish methods by which nodes can come to agreement on the veracity of the information they received.  The Stellar Consensus Protocol white paper outlines the principles of federated Byzantine agreement, by which nodes in a network agree to accept information from a group of trusted nodes, known as quorums or slices.  Consensus in the network spreads as these slices form collective agreement on the information.  ""Every node has a list of other people,"" McCaleb said. ""It doesn't necessarily trust [those nodes], it just needs to think they won't collude with each other.  Work underway  Since December, the network has been relying on a single verifying node until the protocol is ready to be deployed. According to McCaleb, testing is well underway to see how far the system can be pushed.  ""Right now what we have is a small test network of a few nodes just talking to each other and people can kind of play around with it, but it's not production ready by any means,"" he said.  McCaleb added the team is now focused on scaling the new protocol, with a goal of creating significant transaction capacity alongside the ability to meet heavy user activity.  ""Part of the process from now until when we switch over the network is increasing those metrics, squeezing more performance out of it,"" he said.  McCaleb added that Stellar's partner organizations are waiting for the launch of the new system before integrating.  The last mile of money  Overall, McCaleb said that the Stellar Foundation hopes to use the new consensus protocol as a mechanism by which the unbanked and underbanked can achieve greater access to global payment channels.  He speculated that systems like Stellar stand a good chance of capturing the same kind of developmental momentum experienced by payment systems like Kenya's M-Pesa, which has provided a means by which people can store value without having to use a traditional bank account.  McCaleb said he envisions a framework by which Stellar exists as a foundation for the creation of value transfer services that use the network to communicate.  “We kind of want to be the bedrock layer that people can build on top of so you can easily build an M-Pesa like thing in whatever your country is,"" he said. ""And the cool thing is, these things will now all be able to talk to each other.""

42426318,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMPRh,1429034674,New Tool Helps Victims Fight Bitcoin Ransomware,"UPDATE (17th April 2015 10:36): Kaspersky Lab has added a further 711 decryption keys to its database.          Kaspersky Lab has released a new tool to help free computer files 'held hostage' by bitcoin ransomware.      CoinVault, which has infected around 700 computers in the Netherlands, is a strain of malware that demands a rising amount of bitcoin to unlock files it has encrypted.      Thanks to Kaspersky's ransomware decrypter, certain victims can now access their files free of charge.    The tool was created after Dutch authorities sharedhttps://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2015/april/13/11politie-zorgt-voor-doorbraak-in-recente-cryptoware-aanval.html a database of CoinVault's information (including IVs, keys and bitcoin wallets) with the firm as part of an investigation in the country.    Jornt van der Wiel, a security researcher at Kaspersky's global research and analysis unit, told CoinDesk that the company hopes to add more decryption keys to its database. He said:      ""We have uploaded a huge number of keys onto the site, and together with the National High Tech Crime Unit of the Netherlands’ police we are continuously updating the information.""            To pay or not to pay    Though Kaspersky and the Dutch authorities uncovered a sizeable chunk of data, users whose keys are not on the list or those who have been targeted by a different strain of ransomware remain locked out.      When faced with this dilemma, some victims – including police departments – are choosing to pay up and hope for the best.      ""As there are few ways to get files back without paying, users often just give in. This is the wrong strategy, but it’s often the easiest for the user,"" Van der Wiel said.      Additionally, police in the CoinVault investigation argue that payment doesn't always mean you'll get the files back. Rather, this behaviour perpetuates the problem. A translated statement from the department reads:      ""[Paying] motivates the criminals to continue to use this payment method, and furthermore does not always lead to actual release.""              Indeed, a 2014 study from security firm ESNET showed that of the 39,760 people who did pay the ransom of a similar virus, Cryptolocker, only 570 were given access to decryption software after making their payment.      As files can be retrieved only if tools like Kaspersky's are created, the best choice, Van der Wiel says, is protection. Users should keep their anti-malware suite updated and make a habit of backing up their most important files, he added.    About CoinVault    CoinVault first came to the attention of Kaspersky Lab last November. The virus, which has targeted more than 20 countries, usually gains access to victims' machines via phishing emails or links to malicious websites.      Unlike other strains, including Cryptolocker, CoinVault lets victims decrypt one file 'on the house' – perhaps to alleviate worries that documents will remain locked after a payment has been made.      After 24 hours the ransom starts to rise. As the bitcoin address CoinVault provides is ""dynamic"", it is very complex to trace the funds it receives, said Van der Wiel. CoinVault's creators are keen to protect their product too, he added:      ""In terms of functionality we have seen similar malicious applications in the past, including 'TorrentLocker' and some PowerShell ransomware. In fact, the amount of effort invested in protecting CoinVault’s code shows that the cybercriminals are leveraging previously developed libraries and functionality in order to avoid reinventing the wheel.""              Authorities have not made any arrests in connection with CoinVault, but say they still investigating the perpetrator, who is believed to be in the Netherlands.      Users can find the decryption tool at Kaspersky's website, which also features the company's decryption app and 'how to' guides on the subject.

42426316,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMPNh,1429024970,Bitcoin Exchanges in Talks to Join Fight Against Child Pornography,"The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) is planning to work with bitcoin companies to combat the use of digital currency to pay for online child sexual abuse material.  Despite being unable to disclose specifics, Emma Hardy, director of external relations at the IWF, confirmed conversations with bitcoin exchanges were in the ""early stages"".  She said:  “We noted the use of cryptocurrencies in the first quarter of 2014, and specifically the use of bitcoin to pay for child sexual abuse imagery. We know, from our experience, that new services and technologies will always be abused by criminals for their own agendas and we’re really open to working with anyone who seeks to keep their services, networks and exchanges free from criminality.”  The announcement follows the publication of IWF's annual report, which noted bitcoin was being increasingly used by paedophiles to purchase sexually abusive imagery featuring children on the open web.  In its report, the IWF said it received 37 reports of child sexual abuse websites accepting bitcoin between January and April last year. The illicit websites, which appeared as separate folders on legitimate websites, were distributed via spam emails following a hack.  Bitcoin as a criminal tool  The news comes amid the publication of various Europol reports which noted that bitcoin was increasingly being used by criminals.  A study, produced by Europol's EC3 cybercrime centre in February this year, shed new light on the commercial sexual exploitation of children online, while providing evidence that individuals with a sexual interest in children were becoming more entrepreneurial.  In March, Europol released an additional report which said digital currencies were increasingly serving as a money laundering platform for ""freelance criminal entrepreneurs operating on a crime-as-a-service business model"".
