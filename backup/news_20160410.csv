42398985,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpnW,1460295896,Why Datt is Sticking With Bitcoin Over Ethereum,"Ryan X Charles is the founder of the decentralized content sharing platform DATT and a former cryptocurrency engineer at social network Reddit.  In this opinion piece, Charles discusses why he is building his platform on the bitcoin protocol even despite the emergence of new blockchain platforms such as Ethereum.  Since last summer when I announced Datt, an in-development social media platform and application powered by bitcoin, one of the top questions I’ve been asked is, ""Why are you using bitcoin?""  Last year, this question often took a different form. I was asked ""Why not use Stripe?” or ""Why not make an altcoin?"" Since the rally in Ethereum over the past few months, the question has morphed into ""Why not use Ethereum?""  The answer is because Datt only needs Internet money right now, not advanced smart contracts, and switching to Ethereum would incur a large technical and economic cost which would ultimately fail to deliver a proportional return.  If we simply prioritize our feature set, we can and will add advanced smart contracts based on bitcoin when the time is right. Ethereum, at a protocol level, is arguably more advanced than bitcoin. Since it is Turing-complete, it has solved the limitation of the scripting language built into bitcoin.  However, the economy around Ethereum is much more limited than bitcoin, and therefore Ethereum is less useful for Datt.  Possible paths  Because Ethereum has a very different protocol than bitcoin, it isn't easy for bitcoin companies to add support for Ethereum.  Roughly speaking, bitcoin companies have three options:  Increase the technical complexity of their platform by adding Ethereum support to their bitcoin support  Drop their assets in the bitcoin space but keep complexity limited by switching from bitcoin to Ethereum  Solve the hard problems in bitcoin by designing and building complicated systems.  Some companies will choose option one, increasing technical complexity by supporting both Ethereum and bitcoin. This is a mistake.  Rather than shaping their own future, these companies will let their fate be decided by the whims of speculators and hype. I am bearish on companies that divide their effort between two conflicting visions of the future. With the exception of exchanges, they will fail.  Other companies will choose option two, dropping assets in the bitcoin space and supporting Ethereum instead. I think this is a valid option for some companies.  If a company never had strong assets in bitcoin, perhaps they can find a new niche in the Ethereum space. They will take a hit by pivoting, but they could still succeed over the long-term.  However, this path is not actually any easier than the bitcoin path. I predict these companies will ultimately be faced with the same problem they are facing now — lack of traction. They will still have to solve hard problems, but at a later date, and with a smaller market.  Option three is to solve the hard problems in bitcoin.  This is being tackled by companies like Blockstream, 21, OneName and OB1, the development team behind OpenBazaar. These companies see bitcoin as the largest and most secure foundation for the future of finance and information services.  When they encounter problems, they solve them by writing code rather than pivoting to a different platform.  This is the path that I am taking with Datt, with the help of my collaborators. For example, since the bitcoin block size is limited and has recently caused transaction fees to rise, we have started implementing a solution based on payment channels.  New problems  Pivoting to Ethereum wouldn’t eliminate problems for Datt – it would just create new and different problems, and delay our success.  The most useful, important and revolutionary application of blockchain technology is Internet money.  Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto had the right goal and made the right economic decisions when designing bitcoin, in particular limiting the supply of bitcoins to 21 million. The incentives the network and encourages global adoption of bitcoin over the long-term.  It will not be possible for Ethereum or other platforms to outcompete bitcoin at its core value proposition.  Datt, like our older cousins in the space, see an opportunity to service an enormous future market based on bitcoin, not by waiting for other people to solve the hard problems for us, but by solving them ourselves.  Note, I haven’t studied Ethereum in detail at a technical level, so I take its developers at their word that they have solved the Turing-completeness problem correctly. However, I suspect that there are many other less obvious problems around its ability to scale that will need to be solved, just as with bitcoin.  And since bitcoin has a larger economy and a longer head start on solving these problems, I am not convinced that Ethereum, at an ecosystem level, is more advanced than bitcoin or will be able to outpace it.

42398995,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhpwN,1460293210,How I Preordered a Tesla Model 3 With Bitcoin,"Mason Borda is a software engineer at BitGo, creator of GitMoney and the multi-signature Ethereum wallet Etherli.      In his free time, Mason enjoys fostering creativity and innovation in the Bitcoin space as the organizer of the 21 hackathons.      In 2010 the first Bitcoin purchase was made for two pizzas from Papa Johns. By 2011, it was possible to purchase Alpaca socks, and in 2012 VPN access.      Today, I preordered a Tesla Model 3 for 2.413612 BTC.      When I first read about Tesla Motors, it was in regards to the release of the Tesla Roadster in 2007 on Slate. I remember reading the statistics of the vehicle thinking, how is it possible for an electric vehicle to possibly have a 0–60 time that rivals that of the latest model Ferrari. The reality of such acceleration for an electric vehicle seemed illogical at the time. I was left equally skeptical and excited.      This revelation led me to join the electric vehicle engineering club in college, where I led a team to build a battery swapping station for commercial electric vehicles, and coordinated regular tours to Tesla Motors starting in 2010, where we got to ride in a Tesla Roadster.      The ride was better than I had imagined. It was very low to the ground, agile, and one of the fastest vehicles I had ridden in at the time. The acceleration glued me to the seat and propelled me down the highway at an eerily constant torque. I had to have one.      Fast-forward to 2016, still just as big of a fan of new and emerging technologies, I have been entrenched in the world of bitcoin. Today, there are many applications coming online that enable consumers to buy everyday goods for bitcoin.      So, I decided to perform the momentous act of preordering my Tesla Model 3 with bitcoin.    The transaction            My weapon of choice was Shakepay, a new application which enables you to load up a one-time-use credit card for bitcoin.      Using my homebrew SMS interface for my BitGo web wallet, I loaded up a card on Shakepay with bitcoin, and used the card to preorder a Tesla Model 3. The entire process took me 60 seconds once my card was loaded. There was no credit check involved, or a waiting period for the credit card to arrive in the mail – it just worked.      As Steve Coast said, “The world will only get weirder”. How right he was. I just preordered an automobile that I have never seen or touched, which is propelled by electrons flowing through copper wires, that has a 0–60 of under four seconds and supposedly comes with no instrument cluster.      I preordered this vehicle with an invisible currency that was invented by a pseudo-anonymous computer programmer who calls himself Satoshi Nakamoto and is likely not Japanese.      I made this purchase using a service that dispenses ephemeral credit cards made by some Canadian guy that I met online named Jean, whom I met after placing a $400 bitcoin bounty for creating a Bitcoin payable API endpoint that could order and deliver me pizza upon payment. Weird.      Follow Mason @masonic_tweets.
