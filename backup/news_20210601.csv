The investment is the largest single investor fundraiser the firm has had to date. It comes in the wake of Hrxo Network, a decentralized protocol built on Solana that offers permissionless access to liquidity on options markets.      Commonwealth is a global macro and real estate-focused hedge fund that includes veteran investors such as Louis Bacon and Alan Howard. Commonwealth Chief Investment Officer Adam Fisher said the fund chose to invest because of Hxro’s plans to generate liquidity and a stronger market structure in the decentralized options market.      “When volatility expands and the liquidity backs away, market participants who need to adjust their position are pretty much unable to do something,” said Dan Gunsberg, co-founder and CEO of Hxro, adding:      “It’s one thing to get large retail players into the market, but for macro funds or large hedge funds the need to hedge and the need to take position in options is greater than ever.”    Read more: Hxro, FTX Target Retail Crypto Traders With Simplified Options Product    The Hxro Network will offer increased liquidity because it will offer both an automated market maker like many other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and allow traditional market makers into the network as well, Gunsberg said.

42434487,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPDTRh,1622579462,"Market Wrap: ‘Oversold’ Bitcoin Down to $35K, ETH Drops to $2.5K","Investors have been selling bitcoin for the past week, according to on-chain data. Meanwhile, ether’s daily trading volumes have consistently outpaced BTC's.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $35,987 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). In the red 2.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $35,754-$37,833 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,549 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 3.2% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,532-$2,734 (CoinDesk 20)  Bearish bitcoin signal    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour as the two indicators are closing in on each other, a bearish signal for market technicians.      BTC’s price slid from $37,833 at 01:00 UTC (9 p.m. ET Monday) to as low as $35,816 by 17:15 UTC (1:15 p.m. ET) Tuesday, a 5.3% tumble based on CoinDesk 20 data, before rising to $35,987 as of press time.      “Bitcoin is newly oversold from an intermediate-term perspective,” said technical analyst Katie Stockton in her weekly Fairlead Strategies investor note.    Oversold BTC conditions    The past weekend saw the lowest number of bitcoin transfers from exchanges in 2021. On Sunday, May 30, the flow bottomed out at 33,393 daily transfers, according to data aggregator Glassnode. It’s the first time this year fewer than 35,000 transfers were made from exchanges in a day.      In contrast is the high transfer volume to exchanges in the past month, particularly on May 19, when each transaction that day averaged 2 BTC. That’s triple the daily average per transaction of 0.67 BTC so far in 2021.      This Glassnode on-chain information supports Stockton’s oversold theory in the bitcoin market because it appears holders moved BTC to exchanges and sold it, leading to a record-low outflow Sunday.      “Intermediate-term momentum is to the downside, giving way to another lower high within the corrective phase,” added Stockton. “Support is initially near $34,000.”      Read More: Bitcoin’s Long-Term Put Options See Sustained Demand    Ether’s sharp correction    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $2,549 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), slipping 3.2% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average but above the 50-hour, a flat or sideways signal for market technicians.      Ether dipped from $2,734 at 22:00 UTC 01:00 UTC (9 p.m. ET Monday) to $2,532 by 17:15 UTC (1:15 p.m. ET) Tuesday, a 7.3% fall based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has since gone up slightly, at $2,549 as of press time.      “Ether has seen a sharp correction like bitcoin,” said Fairlead’s Stockton. “Intermediate-term momentum has deteriorated. Support is intact near $2,038 on a consecutive closing basis.”      While bitcoin’s 90-day volatility has been, well, volatile over the past three months, ether’s has been even more so. According to data from CoinDesk Research, both assets’ volatility bottomed out in mid-April but ETH’s gyrations are now over 170% while BTC still sits below 100%.      “Yeah, really choppy days,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank. “Ether is naturally a more volatile asset than bitcoin as it is less institutionalized and has a smaller market cap. It therefore acts much like a stock with a higher beta than the market index.”    Ether’s resilience might be function of liquidity    One of the reasons for ETH’s price resiliency might be because its trading volume is starting to go higher than BTC on most days, giving it increased liquidity.      “In the last couple of days ETH and BTC have both been declining at similar percentage rates,” said John Willock, CEO of crypto custody provider Tritum. “But ETH overall has fared and recovered most of its lost value much better after the last couple of weekends of market volatility.”      Based on the latest available data from CoinGecko, ETH volumes were at $43 million on Monday while $37 million BTC changed hands on major spot trading venues.      Over the past month, ether trading volumes have been higher than bitcoin's for 12 total days. Over the past week, ETH volumes have been higher than BTC for four days. This is a trend analysts will be watching closely because higher volumes can affect prices when they skew towards either buys or sells.      “ETH is quickly becoming recognized as an exciting asset as a standalone,” Willock said.      Read More: Lithium Raises $5M for Decentralized Oracle Tracking Private Assets    Other markets    Fairlead’s Stockton thinks the weeks ahead for crypto may be a time for traders to “risk-on.” This is a term for bullish market positioning, anticipating the next short-term upward cycle.      “The takeaway is for a shift toward risk-on positioning for the next week or two,” Stockton said.

One of the sources, from a tZERO partner company, said: “They've been open to selling it for a while.”      The alternative trading system (ATS) is the crown jewel of Overstock’s Medici Ventures. Medici’s stable of blockchain projects was brought under the management of VC firm Pelion Venture Partners earlier this year, part of Overstock’s plan to eventually exit its blockchain-related investments.      According to tZERO VP of Investor Relations Michael Mougias, the goal is not to sell tZERO, but rather to find the right strategic partners. However, this could mean going down a number of possible routes including taking tZERO public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Mougias added.      “There could be strategic buyers that perhaps want to take control of the business, or take up a majority stake in the business, which would result in a change of control, and that would technically be a buyer,” Mougias said in an interview.      A capital raise for tZERO is under way and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are being signed with VCs and traditional private equity firms, tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi said during a webinar last month.      “Overstock has been a great incubator for tZERO, but it is now time for us to seek outside, strategic capital to accelerate growth and adoption,” Noursalehi said in an email when reached by CoinDesk, adding:      “To that end, we recently engaged a major global investment bank to run a process for tZERO with the goal of not only raising growth capital but finding partners that can expedite bringing assets to our unique secondary market platform for digital securities.”    Long road    Overstock’s visionary, albeit controversial, former CEO Patrick Byrne deserves credit for being among the earliest supporters of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The e-commerce site became the first publicly traded company to accept bitcoin payments through a partnership with Coinbase back in 2014.      Staying ahead of the game, it became a personal mission of Byrne’s to build a fully transparent exchange designed to trade tokenized stock with instant settlement times. He resigned from the company in August 2019.      Over the course of 2020, the tZERO ATS onboarded and commenced trading of Overstock’s digital preferred dividend (OSTKO) and the St. Regis Aspen digital security (ASPD). It also signed a tokenization agreement with Tynton Capital, a technology-focused investment fund.    Read more: tZERO Signs 3 Firms Looking to Tokenize Securities    Most recently, tZERO signed three firms – OmniValley, Trellis Platform and Wunderfund – to use the security token trading platform.

""Bitcoin funds continue to see outflows and gold exchange-traded funds continue to see inflows, suggesting that the shift away from bitcoin and back into traditional gold by institutional investors is still underway,” according to the report by JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou.      May marked a 35% drop in price for bitcoin, making it one of the worst months to date for the cryptocurrency.      ""There is little doubt that the boom and bust dynamics of the past weeks represent a setback to the institutional adoption of crypto markets and in particular of bitcoin and ethereum,” according to the report.      The analyst sees medium-term fair value for bitcoin in the $24,000 to $36,000 range.      “We had argued previously that the failure of bitcoin to break above the $60K threshold would see momentum signals turn more bearish and induce further position unwinds, and that this has likely been a significant factor in the correction last week” in pushing commodity trading advisors and other momentum-based investors to cut positions, the bank said.

However, that may not bode well for bitcoin in the short term.      The index's real earnings yield – inflation-adjusted return for every dollar invested – was minus-0.81% last week, according to Barron's, having turned negative in early May.      ""The hunt for alternatives could escalate in the wake of negative real returns in the stock market,"" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, told CoinDesk. ""However, bitcoin is not exactly in the sweet spot right now.""      Bitcoin has been pitched as an inflation hedge by some cryptocurrency analysts, since the pace of its supply expansion is reduced by 50% every four years via a process known as a mining reward halving.      Read more: Bitcoin's Long-Term Put Options See Sustained Demand as Price Consolidates      The cryptocurrency charted a near sixfold rally from October 2020 through March 2021, outperforming traditional assets by a wide margin, as the rising stockpile of negative-yielding global bonds drove investors further out on the risk spectrum.      With the S&P 500 Index of large U.S. stocks offering a negative earnings yield on an inflation-adjusted basis, one theoretically might expect more money to flow into crypto markets and propel bitcoin to fresh record highs.      However, big gains may remain elusive for some time because the bitcoin market sentiment has weakened in recent weeks due to an increased focus on the potential environmental damage from cryptocurrency mining, and the greater regulatory scrutiny of the industry in China.      ""Bitcoin is being weighed down by regulatory fears,"" Morris said, adding that the dour mood is reflected in on-chain activity.      Fears the U.S. Federal Reserve may soon scale back liquidity-boosting stimulus to contain inflation may keep investors from pouring money into bitcoin. Minutes of the April Fed meeting released last month showed policymakers were beginning to consider thinking about tapering and reduce the U.S. central bank's $120 billion-a-month of bond purchases, a way of injecting extra liquidity into financial markets.      “A number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the committee’s goals, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases,"" according to the minutes.      Tapering is a risk for bitcoin, according to Messari research analyst Mira Christanto.      ""Bitcoin is considered by fiat-based institutional investors at the extreme end of the risk spectrum,"" Christanto said in a recently published note. ""It thrives in quantitative easing (QE), irresponsible fiscal and monetary policy, and doesn’t quite like quantitative tightening (QT).""      Read more: Bitcoin Rejected Near $38K After Two-Day Price Gain      While Christanto doesn't foresee the Fed pulling the plug anytime soon, she expects taper fears to persist for some time.      ""Crypto investors still need to pay special attention to upcoming data prints, as capital to this new asset class is still mercenary and tends to overreact on the bull and bear side,” Christanto noted.      Stock markets might look overdue for a pullback, with the negative earnings yield signaling overstretched valuations. With bitcoin sometimes trading in line with stocks, that might create downside risk.      Historically, negative real earnings yields have paved the way for stock market corrections, based on data shared by Jeroen Blokland, portfolio manager for the Robeco Multi-Asset funds, on LinkedIn.      So a potential risk-off mood in stock markets could have an immediate bearish impact on the cryptocurrency. That goes against the popular narrative of bitcoin being a safe haven like gold – an asset preferred during times of stress.      ""While bitcoin is sometimes referred to as 'digital gold,' gold is seen as a safe-haven, sleepy asset, while bitcoin is viewed as a risk-on, growth asset,"" Messari's Mira Christanto said.      Jeff Currie, head of commodities at Goldman Sachs, voiced a similar opinion during a CNBC interview on Tuesday.      ""Digital currencies are not substitutes for gold,"" Currie said. ""If anything, they would be a substitute for copper; they are pro-risk, risk-on assets.""      ""They are a substitute for risk-on inflation hedges, not risk-off inflation hedges,"" Currie added.

The company’s unaudited financials for Q1 report a net income of $200,000 from $29.6 million in gross profit. Additionally, Canaan reported that it had sold some 2 terahashes worth of mining equipment in the first quarter of the year, more than doubling the machines they sold in Q4 of 2020 when COVID-chocked supply lines undermined Canaan’s bottomline.

Canaan CEO Nangeng Zhang said the company’s financial turnaround was “driven by the bitcoin price rally” and higher demand from customers.      “During the period we improved our mining machine production yields and secured sufficient capacity for future production,” Zhang said. “We have obtained a large number of pre-orders from long-term clients both at home and abroad,”      Canaan noted in its report that its contract liabilities for hardware, now worth $184 million, have nearly tripled since the end of last year.    Bitcoin mining migrates to North America    Notably, 78% percent of the orders underpinning these contracts are coming from outside China, Canaan noted. In prior years, this percentage point has been in the single digits.      “Our revenues generated from overseas markets increased to 78.4% of our total net revenues in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 4.9% in the same period of 2020.

42406484,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeujpK,1622564931,Bitcoin Is Batman,"According to philosopher Craig Warmke, Bitcoin is basically Batman.      Well, I may be taking a bit of liberty with Warmke's argument.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The assistant professor of philosophy at Northern Illinois University and a member of the crypto-oriented research collective Resistance Money has a forthcoming paper that contends Bitcoin is a collective story that all participants in the network participate in writing.      We all endlessly discuss ""What Is Bitcoin,"" and it doesn't appear that even the maximalists have settled on a consensus answer.      Warmke's conception of Bitcoin as a collective fiction is, if nothing else, novel in the corpus of explanations.      Note that the argument here isn't saying Bitcoin is like a story.      He's saying it is a story, one that happens to also have value in the real world. This isn't so hard to understand, as we'll see.      Bitcoin is a story and bitcoin is the story's main subject. As stories go, it's pretty boring. It's the story of new bitcoin getting issued and then moving from one wallet to another – forever. The plot is: Bitcoin moves around within Bitcoin. Scintillating!      The Bitcoin network uses writing (code) to describe something with no external correspondence, and yet it has value. That's fiction. As Warmke puts it toward the end of the paper, ""If the chunk of code in the Bitcoin blockchain that describes a movement of bitcoin is not itself that movement, where does the movement, the transaction, take place? Nowhere – or everywhere, depending on how you think of it… Bitcoin is a fictional substance.""    Read more: Opinion: Why Bitcoin Needs Philosophy    In his conception, miners are publishers and nodes are referees. Wallet owners have the right to write but only so long as they have some fictional bitcoin to compose a sentence about, and the only thing that sentence can say is how much bitcoin is going to a certain wallet.    But … fiction?    So let me give you my way of thinking about Warmke's paper by way of the Caped Crusader: It helps to explain why Bitcoin is like Batman™. Batman is also a fictional object within a story. It is an extremely valuable story, in fact. The 1989 ""Batman"" sparked a global pop culture sensation and netted over $400 million at the box office. The ""Dark Knight"" film trilogy was worth $2.5 billion in revenue to Warner Bros. at the box office alone, and that's just recent proceeds, just from the films.      The Caped Crusader has been printing money for its owners across books, toys and other media since 1939. Beat that, Satoshi!      What non-comic book fans may not realize is that Batman's value has persisted in part because his story keeps growing (much like Bitcoin's).      The Batman story continues each month, all over the pages of DC Comics where he appears an impossible number of times in numerous titles, new bits of story coming out every week.      Bob Kane and Bill Finger are credited with inventing Batman, but his legend has grown as countless writers, artists and editors add to the massive Batman mythology.      Each Batman story effectively becomes a bit of ""real"" history. In fact, every single thing that happens in any DC comic book is part of the history of the world that Batman lives in, and those histories frequently bleed into each other.      Once a DC superhero comic book is published, it becomes canon and any other writer can pick up where that story left off, even if done in the pages of a whole other title. The term-of-art in comics for this is ""continuity."" It's another way of saying ""history of a fictional world.""    We like a story in which a character surprises us, but only if it surprises us in a way that still feels right.    In other words, writers and artists have something like writing rights in the collective story of a comic book universe but, also like in Bitcoin, there are limitations.      Writers and artists are like the wallets in Warmke's conception, adding sentences to the Batman ledger.      But editors are like bitcoin nodes. Their job is, in part, to guard against continuity errors in Batman's history (making sure a new story doesn't contradict an old one, for example) and to make sure consensus gets maintained around Batman.      There are an infinite number of Batman stories, but that infinite set is not unbounded.      If a writer came in one day with a script where Bruce Wayne decided to open a flower shop rather than fight crime, I would expect the editor would reject that story.      Such a story, one might say, would break consensus about the character of Batman. We like a story in which a character surprises us, but only if it surprises us in a way that still feels right. That's the consensus part. ""Batman: Caped Chrysanthemum Curator"" would surprise readers in a bad way.      Furthering Warmke's framework here, obviously, DC Comics is Batman's publisher, his equivalent of a mining network (much more centralized). Diamond Comics Distributors is his internet, the Batman distribution network.    Both very valuable    This network keeps the thing that is Batman™ moving forward, a story that keeps growing. It's a much more interesting story than reading the Bitcoin ledger.      And for different reasons, those stories have real value in the real world. But they are still stories.      At the end of the day, this is an ontological argument about what it means for something to exist, and Warmke has constructed a thought-provoking model here that might drive consensus around that ""is"" question about Bitcoin.      The next time people ask you: ""What Is Bitcoin?"" you can tell them: ""It's a story that's written collectively by all the bitcoin holders. It gets more valuable the more people know about it, help write it and the longer the story goes on.""    Read more: The Node: Bitcoin Is Real, Fictional Money    Inevitably, they will counter: ""How does that make sense?""      To which, we are currently prone to saying something like: ""Look, money is a collective fiction, too."" That's usually taken as sort of a college sophomore level cliché – it rings hollow every time.      But now you can say: ""Obviously, it's just like Batman.""

42406492,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeujxC,1622557285,Black Wall Street 3.0,"One hundred years after a devastating massacre desecrated a thriving black community in Tulsa, Okla.’s Greenwood neighborhood, Hill Harper and his team are reviving the vision of ""Black Wall Street"" in digital form by creating a Black-owned cryptocurrency exchange and digital wallet.      The initiative aims to increase access to financial education in Black and other communities of color. In the words of Harper, “When we talk about financial literacy, to me it's about an ecosystem of problems that requires an ecosystem of systemic solutions. We start with financial literacy, we move to financial capacity building, ultimately getting to financial empowerment.”    Jordan Muthra is head of studio/head engineer, CoinDesk TV.    We are entering a phase of increased collective consciousness but not without a wide wealth gap, institutional racism and proud racists surfacing. We have moved from a place of ""racial paranoia"" to being jaded by the widespread evidence of prejudice due to the proliferation of social media and other consequences of the Information Age.      This prejudice can be noted in practices of predatory capitalism that target minority communities. “When you really, actually peel back the onion, 90% to 95% of the financial products and services that have historically been offered to Black, brown and marginalized communities have been either predatory on their face or hidden predatory,” Harper told CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 event last week.      As a community, Black folks have always strived to own and operate both infrastructure and the means of production but have been continually held back by structural inequality and attacks from extremists and the government alike. The Greenwood District, which was burned down 100 years ago this week, was densely populated with Black business owners, which enabled the community to keep money in local circulation.      “There were three pillars in my mind,” said Harper. “Number one was institutional ownership. Pillar number two [was] institutional trust. Pillar number three was the movement of money or capital within the ecosystem.""      At present, a dollar circulates within the Black community for six hours on average before exiting. “I believe,” Hill argues, “if we don't own our own digital wallets and don't onboard and educate folks about digital currency and cryptocurrency concurrently, then that dollar will be leaving within six to seven seconds.”      Today, African Americans are among the biggest consumers in the U.S. but are primarily not the owners of infrastructure or rights to intellectual property. Despite being the frontrunners of cultural capital, the arts and innovation, Black folks don't often participate in ownership or distribution.      The Black Wall Street app hopes to be a safe and trusted place for the Black community to exchange and hold value developed from the ground up. As we enter the Web 3.0 era, the unbanked and underbanked must not be left behind as society moves away from fiat currency. Hill Harper, an actor who has appeared in ""CSI: NY"", ""Limitless"" and ""The Good Doctor,"" is a Harvard-educated lawyer who sat in a class with Barack Obama during his time at Harvard Law. The app was engineered by CTO Brian Griffin, while Najah Roberts is the startup’s blockchain expert and chief visionary officer.      As the “great wealth transfer” shifts capital from boomers to their children, the Black community needs to be a part of it. The Black Wall Street App seeks to increase financial literacy among members of the Black community. The Black Wall Street app is not a get-rich-quick scheme nor will it be exclusive to the Black and brown communities. It will be available to everyone with all getting the added value of using the platform.      “Number one, we're going to be cheaper than Coinbase, cheaper than Cash App and we're going to give folks more for their money,” Harper said.    Read more: Bitcoin Is a Way to Repair Economic Injustice: Author Isaiah Jackson    Hill Harper and Najah Roberts are currently on a 30-city financial literacy tour to engage members in the Black community across the country. “We don't want to set our people up to fail because they've been burned so many times,"" Harper said.      Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin can be an effective hedge against inflation given the finite supply of Satoshis and increasing demand. We don't want a wider wealth gap because underserved communities are not engaged in diversified investments, especially investments that result in increased spending power over time.      Multiplication works better than addition. Strategic investments that compound interest or favorable annual percentage yield (APY) are more effective than saving paper fiat under the mattress or paying the bank to invest your money for their benefit.      Minority groups need to own and curate wealth within their communities. “For too long, particularly in tech, we've allowed tech companies to monetize our community,"" said Harper. ""And our communities are the community that's made apps like Clubhouse billion-dollar apps [and] apps like Twitter billion-dollar apps, yet we have never owned them. This is an opportunity for us to monetize culture and keep the money circulating within our culture.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Jordan Muthra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/01/black-wall-street-30,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/213ca8feaf4e9599a28b20104f4a8ac7d0cd8064-1400x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Additionally, Coinbase said in a blog post it will begin offering cash-back spending reward features to waitlisters this week. The card is available across the U.S. (with the exception of Hawaii); a variation rolled out in European markets in 2019.      The debit card works by converting users’ cryptocurrency balances, such as bitcoin, to fiat at point of sale, allowing them to essentially pay with crypto at any card-accepting merchant. Notably, it promises 4% rewards in stellar and 1% in bitcoin. Most debit cards don’t have a cash-back program, let alone one in crypto.      But competition for crypto payments is picking up.      Mastercard and Gemini are preparing to unveil a crypto credit card with 3% bitcoin returns. And BlockFi, too, has a rewards-fueled crypto credit card in the works. As bitcoin becomes ensconced as an asset rather than as a medium of exchange in the minds of most users, the spending enticements could move the needle on crypto payments despite unfavorable U.S. tax laws.

In an announcement Monday, ETC Group said this is the first time a cryptocurrency ETP will be made available for trading on the U.K. market or any European MTF.  Trading of the ETP will take place in four different currencies, GBP, CHF, euro, and U.S. dollar. The clearing will be carried out by Switzerland-based central counterparty clearing house SIX x-clear.  So far, the U.K. has been taking a cautious approach to approving crypto products. In January the Financial Conduct Authority banned the sale of derivatives and exchange-traded notes describing the products to be ill-suited for retail consumers due to the potential harm they pose.  Earlier today ETC Group listed two exchange-traded commodities, the BTCetc – ETC Group Physical Bitcoin and the ETHetc – ETC Group Physical Ethereum on the Euronext stock exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam.  The firm said it has seen investors include exposure to crypto ETPs in their portfolios as a hedge against inflation.  “ETC Group provides exposure to bitcoin, ether, and litecoin through our 100% physically backed cryptocurrency ETPs, and bringing our flagship bitcoin product to Aquis Exchange was a logical step as institutional demand for exposure to crypto grows around the world,” said Bradley Duke, CEO of ETC Group.

42406491,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeujvE,1622554200,State of Crypto: Federal Regulations Are Coming Into Focus,"May was a pretty eventful month on the U.S. regulatory front (and on the crypto front generally). The Biden Administration is finally moving beyond broad statements and beginning to hint at what the industry can actually expect from new crypto regulations.    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  The Biden Administration gets busy  The narrative    Bitcoin’s price dropped 30%, then recovered a bit, then dropped a bit more, and Elon Musk was only partly responsible. Various U.S. government officials at different agencies described how they’re looking at crypto and crypto regulations. A congressional caucus focused on fintech and crypto has launched.    Why it matters    We’re finally getting a glimpse into how exactly President Joe Biden’s administration sees crypto. There’ve been more warnings against bad actors and too-fast efforts than there are concrete regulatory proposals, but the general trendline seems to be a growing acceptance that crypto is here to stay.    Breaking it down    A lot happened in the last two weeks.      The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation officially published its request for information about how banks are using digital assets and what the federal regulator could do to assist entities.      New Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu announced he had ordered his staff to review all pending matters and interpretive guidance issued under the Trump administration (read: former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks) before revealing in a congressional hearing the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were discussing a potential interagency group to examine crypto policy. (Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles confirmed this in another hearing last week.)      A day later, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the Fed’s first research paper about a digital dollar would be published this summer, and he believes a U.S. central bank digital currency should prioritize consumer privacy and protection.      A few hours after that, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler warned that bad actors in crypto should prepare for enforcement actions. He spoke during an address to 1,700 members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.      Also on Thursday, the Treasury Department published a tax plan that included an entire section on crypto, warning there was a “significant detection problem” with crypto use for illicit activities. It suggested that exchanges receiving over $10,000 in crypto in a single transaction should report it.      So, yeah, a lot happened.      My personal opinion: Overall, the week was a good sign for the industry. Mainstream adoption will depend in some part on crypto being seen as “normal,” like cash or more traditional assets. As Caitlin Long of Wyoming and Avanti fame put it in this excellent thread, the U.S.’ policy approach under the Biden Administration so far seems to be “if you comply with applicable laws and regulations, we’re cool with whatever.”      Through that lens, the Internal Revenue Service cracking down on those trying to hide their crypto gains or Gensler’s SEC going after scammers or other lawbreakers is good.      (This is, of course, dependent at least a little on Gensler providing some of the regulatory clarity everyone hopes for so crypto companies don’t have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal counsel to try and conduct a small, legally compliant token sale.)      The Fed’s paper, I think, will be informative, but I’ve still seen nothing to suggest the central bank is actually going to issue a digital dollar or any other form of central bank digital currency. The fact it’s having these discussions publicly is a good sign, though. It normalizes how other institutions are going to be talking about this subject – such as, for example, those banks that may be hesitant to offer crypto companies services or to dabble in stablecoins.      The FDIC’s involvement is another positive sign for banks. If (and this is a pretty big if) banks can secure deposit insurance for crypto-related activities, financial institutions can be even more confident that any money they store in crypto is safe.      The main issues that should concern the industry stem from the OCC. I don’t think Hsu’s review of Brooks’ actions are a surprise. He’s a new agency head who was about to testify in front of a committee, whose chair has already asked President Joe Biden to overturn Brooks’ actions. I’d have been surprised if Hsu said anything other than “we’re taking a look, we’ll get back to you later.”      That being said, the same day as the congressional hearing, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who runs the Senate Banking Committee, asked Hsu to “reassess” the OCC trust charters issued to Anchorage, Paxos and Protego. These companies currently have conditional trust charters, so Hsu’s response will be key here. Recall that Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, has already asked that Brooks’ OCC regulations be overturned. With that sort of pressure we might not see much in the way of further crypto-friendly regulations from the agency.      On the flip side: Bitcoin’s recent market movements are probably not great for getting a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved.    Baby banks    Nathan DiCamillo contributed reporting.      Nebraska and Illinois are getting their own special purpose depository institution/crypto banking laws, following in Wyoming’s footsteps and taking the industry closer to having banking institutions stemming directly from the industry.      Illinois’ trust charter bill would create a special purpose trust charter for digital assets, which both new businesses and existing financial institutions – such as banks – could take advantage of, said Rep. Margaret Croke (D), the bill’s sponsor.      The bill would offer stability to businesses that wonder how they could legally provide crypto companies with services, Croke said.      Illinois is starting with a focus on custody, but Chasse Rehwinkel, the acting state banking director, didn’t rule out expanding regulations to cover lending or other activities in the future.      Croke noted that Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured entities can offer crypto custody services under the Illinois bill.      Similarly, Nebraska's new law would create newly chartered digital asset banks or new digital asset divisions within already established banks.      “I think we’re going to see the true value of crypto over the next few years, but I do think it’s definitely going to have a place in our financial institutions. I think the international impact of crypto and blockchain is a whole ‘nother conversation, but the international aspect I find very, very compelling,” Croke told me.      Croke said the regulations has support from various business types, though she said she couldn’t name any of these businesses at this time.      Importantly, Illinois’ bill appears to have support directly from the state’s banks, according to Rehwinkel.      “More than a year ago we were talking with our existing banks that were trying to be in the crypto space and also the general industry that was looking for custodial services in an Illinois-based company that dealt with crypto, so that spurred us to look around at what other states have done,” Rehwinkel said.      Illinois’ trust charter is designed to fold new crypto rules into the state’s existing bank regulations, Rehwinkel said.      “As we develop new charters, there’s probably things we can pick up and drop off. We always appreciate Wyoming going first with what made sense to them and then looking at the pieces and seeing what makes sense for us,” Rehwinkel said.      The Illinois bill would let de novo, or new, institutions to begin operating, he said.      Nebraska's legislative bill 649 requires that institutions under the new charter call themselves ""digital asset banks"" and not refer to themselves just as ""banks.""      Unlike Wyoming's special purpose depository institutions, digital asset banks under the Nebraska legislation cannot take fiat deposits. Like SPDIs, they can custody crypto and stake digital assets.      The measure allows state and national banks to work side by side on digital asset initiatives as letters from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency make national banks more comfortable with digital assets, said Mark Quandahl, an Omaha attorney involved in the Nebraska legislation.      “I think this is kind of a good step to help spur more innovation and further items and policy items that the legislature might need to discuss to make sure this is an industry that is both safely overseen and has a strong regulatory structure, but is able to grow and be all that it intends to do,” Rehwinkel said.    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    We continue to sit in a sort of limbo period waiting for President Joe Biden to nominate some full-term heads for some of these agencies. These hypothetical future agency heads will provide further clarity at how the administration looks at crypto regulations.

Outside CoinDesk:  (Wall Street Journal) A few weeks ago I wrote about a New York power generation facility that had pivoted to bitcoin mining and was expanding its operations. A Montana power plant that runs on coal is now following suit, according to the Wall Street Journal, though it’s unclear to me whether its operators are also planning to convert the fuel source to natural gas.  (The Washington Post) Joe Biden’s administration is now looking at crypto, and White House officials have received briefings from federal regulators, the Washington Post reports. Interestingly, the focus seems to be on investor protection without killing the industry (SEC chief Gary Gensler’s position), and officials aren’t concerned about crypto being a systemic risk.  (Politico) It feels like we've been talking about bitcoin ETFs for a while now (we have), but there's reason for that: Regulators and lawmakers are still concerned about what they view as a volatile, less-than-safe bitcoin market. This Politico report breaks down some of these concerns.

It will also go toward the launch of the protocol's subsequent mainnet in beta and help develop the project's ecosystem.      See also: What Is an Oracle?      Lithium Finance is based on a Determinant-based Mutual Information (DMI) mechanism, in which participants are asked subjective multiple-choice questions to find a dominant truth. The answer provides price discovery for illiquid assets.      In the case of Lithium, the mechanism is fuelled by reward and punishment of participants through staking the protocol's native Lithium tokens (LITH). Staking ensures users who provide irrelevant and malicious answers are punished, while users who are able to generate insights are rewarded with LITH tokens. Through the collection of multiple users' opinions a “wisdom of the crowd” price, based on each user's reputational stake, is produced.

The net asset value (NAV) of the $65 billion fund, which held Lehman commercial paper among its assets, fell below $1 a share, causing demand for withdrawals to escalate and prompting a run on money market funds in general.      In the crypto market, a stablecoin like tether – the value of which is pegged to the U.S. dollar – is the equivalent of a money market fund and investors should be concerned about the possibility of its value also falling below $1, according to Massad.    Potential Liquidity Shock    Tether recently disclosed that only around 10% of its assets were in cash, reverse repo notes and Treasury bills as of March 31. With the majority of tether's backing not being in the form of fiat currency, Massad said holders of USDT are ""on notice that they may have trouble getting back $1 for each token.""      The question then is whether Tether would be able to withstand a sudden wave of withdrawals and what its effect would be on the wider crypto ecosystem. A JPMorgan research note recently stated that a loss in confidence in tether ""would likely generate a severe liquidity shock"" to bitcoin markets, given that 50%-60% of all BTC trades are for USDT.      Massad also referred to CoinDesk's description of tether as ""a key piece of the plumbing for the roughly $2 trillion global market,"" given that traders ""use it to quickly transfer dollar value between exchanges to capture arbitrage opportunities when a bank wire is unavailable.""      A liquidity decline would cause crypto prices to fall, squeezing those with leveraged positions.      Regulation of stablecoins must be strengthened, according to Massad. He referred to a bill introduced in Congress in December that would require stablecoin issuers to follow the same regulations and conform to the same standards as banks.      ""Whether it moves forward is anyone's guess,"" Massad's piece concluded.",NEGATIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | USDT,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/01/disruption-in-tethers-value-could-be-crypto-equivalent-of-breaking-the-buck-former-cftc-chairman,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49c62b1e58b9af43b87f58f1a41297c6ee74ec66-2400x2242.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While many of the ETPs are already trading on the Deutsche Börse Xetra market in Germany, the investment firms expanded their range of products to France and Amsterdam due to investor demand.      WisdomTree announced Monday it had listed the WisdomTree Bitcoin and WisdomTree Ethereum products on the Euronext Paris and Amsterdam stock exchanges with a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.95%.      New York-based investment management firm VanEck is listing the VanEck Vectors Bitcoin exchange-traded note (ETN) and VanEck Vectors Ethereum ETN on both exchanges with a TER of 1%.      ETC Group has listed two exchange-traded commodities (ETCs): the BTCetc – ETC Group Physical Bitcoin with a TER of 2%, and the ETHetc – ETC Group Physical Ethereum with a TER of 1.49% on the Euronext Paris and Amsterdam. Both ETCs are issued in Germany by ETC Group and marketed and distributed by HANetf, the firm said.      Switzerland-based investment product provider 21Shares, formerly known as Amun, has listed three ETPs on the Euronext Paris stock exchange. The three ETPs will give investors exposure to bitcoin and ether with a TER of 1.49%. The third product is a “short bitcoin” ETP. Unlike WisdomTree, VanEck, and the ETC Group, 21Shares has not listed products on Euronext Amsterdam.      “The listing of our products in euros on Euronext Paris was a major step for us because it allows members of the Euronext markets, whether they are in Paris or Amsterdam, to have access to them. There was no particular interest in having a dual listing for the same products. On the other hand, we will launch our trackers in dollars on the Euronext Amsterdam to meet the demand of European institutional investors who don't have access to the Swiss SIX exchange,” said Laurent Kssis, managing director of 21Shares' ETP business.

According to data provider Skew, the six-month put-call skew, which measures the relative expensiveness of puts and calls, crossed above zero on May 17, indicating a bias for puts.      The metric has remained positive ever since, and was hovering at 4% at press time. That's the longest stretch above zero in at least a year.      ""Longer-term bitcoin options [skew] are seeing sustained prints above zero for the first time this year, indicating demand for puts,"" Fredrick Collins, an options trader and researcher at Glassnode, tweeted Monday. ""Before this, bitcoin was the only major asset besides gold and Japanese yen to consistently trade with a more expensive upside.""      A call option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put buyer gets the right to sell.      While bitcoin had several price pullbacks in the 10 months to April 2021, the six-month put-call skew remained entrenched in negative territory in a sign market participants were confident the declines would be short-lived and lead to more substantial rallies. They were right and the cryptocurrency rose to record highs after every pullback.      This time, however, investors appear worried about an extended sell-off and see low probability of a V-shaped recovery, as evidenced by the persistent positive six-month put-call skew.      Bitcoin tanked from $58,000 to nearly $30,000 in the eight days to May 19 on concerns regarding the negative environmental impact of bitcoin mining and China's regulatory crackdown.      Since then, the cryptocurrency has charted a narrowing price range between $30,000 and $40,000. Some technical analysts foresee a short-term price bounce. That's not reflected in the options market. The one-week, one-month and three-month put-call skews are signaling a put bias with positive prints.      Market participants could be buying puts against a long position in the spot or futures market, or taking a plain long put position to profit from a potential downside move.

42406486,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeujqJ,1622533510,OCC Chief Says US Officials Should Set 'Regulatory Perimeter' for Crypto: Report,"The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) may be looking to bolster efforts with other government agencies to increase oversight of the crypto market.      According to a Financial Times report on Monday, Michael Hsu, who became acting comptroller since May 10, said he would like U.S. officials to work in lockstep to set a ""regulatory perimeter"" for cryptocurrencies.      U.S. crypto regulations have been piecemeal, with agencies creating their own interpretive guidance and rulemaking but without any federal legislation to define authority and jurisdiction.      “It really comes down to coordinating across the agencies,” Hsu said, according to the report. “Just in talking to some of my peers there is interest in coordinating a lot more of these things.”      Hsu's comments come two weeks after he said he had requested a review of all of the OCC's pending matters, interpretative letters, and guidance relating to digital assets and cryptocurrencies.      A day after Hsu announced his request on May 19, the acting comptroller told a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., that his bureau, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may set up an interagency ""sprint"" policy team to examine the cryptocurrency industry.      The OCC is an independent bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Its role is to charter, regulate and supervise all national banks and federal savings associations in the country as well as federal branches and agencies of foreign banks.
