On one hand, the news affected Bitcoin&apos;s price and gave ammunition to the nay-sayers that think that governments will outlaw Bitcoin. On the other, the network kept working without a hiccup, recovered its hashrate in record time, and gained in decentralization. However, a question remained. Why did China exclude itself from this very lucrative activity in which they were dominating? As Bitcoin entrepreneur John Carvalho not-so-eloquently put it, &apos;I refuse to believe that China is stupid.&apos; There has to be a reason, even if it&apos;s a simple one. To help our audience solve the puzzle, NewsBTC decided to gather all of our theories in a single post. China Ban Theory #1: The Digital Yuan CBDC This one is as straightforward as it gets. When China started cracking down on miners, NewsBTC reported: &apos;As for the possible reasons, Bitcoin Magazine&apos;s Lucas Nuzzi cites the upcoming Digital Yuan CBDC.&apos; And Nuzzi said, &apos;They&apos;re literally rolling out their own coin (a CBDC) that will enable the mass surveillance and unbanking of dissidents.&apos; 1/ The CCP officially banning #Bitcoin should come as no surprise.
