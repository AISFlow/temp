42429073,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLra1h,1526158612,A Daily Show Comedian Showed Up to Roast an Ethereum Conference,"""No one knows what the fuck is going on.""  That's according to Ronny Chieng, senior correspondent on the satirical news program The Daily Show, who took the stage at Ethereal Summit on Saturday with ConsenSys founder and CEO Joseph Lubin and Kavita Gupta, founding managing partner at ConsenSys Ventures.  Chieng, who spoke with Lubin in December on the show, again criticized the big promises and hype of the industry. He argued that many people in the industry use complicated jargon and words that were ""invented"" two or fewer years ago to camouflage the fact that they don't actually know how the technology will change the world.  The Daily Show correspondent said at one point:  ""You could talk about anything with these people. You could talk about the NBA playoffs and they'd be like, 'Yeah we're going to use blockchain to defeat LeBron.'""  In a room full of ethereum devotees, Chieng's jokes garnered laughs, but also hit on topics that should cause blockchain enthusiasts to ruminate on.  For instance, Chieng was critical of all the attention cryptocurrency was getting, questioning its resurgence in interest since peer-to-peer technology has been around since decentralized file-sharing platform BitTorrent.  Lubin – who had trouble getting a word in – acknowledged this, but said the time is right for decentralized technology to take hold.  ""BitTorrent was attacked in significant ways. It was stigmatized and didn't come out at a time when there was popular sentiment,"" Lubin countered, adding:  ""Trust is lost in centralized institutions.""  Indeed, several speakers at the two-day conference mentioned Facebook's recent scandal, which saw third-parties were collecting Facebook user's private data, as an example of how the narrative around these centralized institutions is starting to shift.  Money madness  Still, Chieng didn't let up, saying that the drastically fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies should be seen as an obvious sign of a bubble. Although he chided, he is more than willing to make money off of it.  Blockchain, he said, is ""what dumb people like myself can make money off of in the short term.""  According to Chieng, he hasn't succeeded in that mission just yet. He told the audience that after the initial Daily Show segment with Lubin, a viewer emailed him to thank him for making dogecoin, the silly cryptocurrency with a Shiba Inu dog mascot, pump (even though the show spoke about it in a negative light).  ""And then I stupidly jumped on Ripple. What a mistake that was,"" Chieng said, before declaring: ""Fuck Ripple.""  Lubin tempered the exuberance over price, saying that ConsenSys has a policy that developers can't talk about the price, suggesting the usual narrative in the space that the technology is much more important and interesting than the price.  But, Lubin said, bull markets are nice in that they spur more funding and participation by entrepreneurs and technologists.  ""It's great when the price goes up because it brings more resources into the ecosystem,"" Lubin said.  Chieng still seemed skeptical, and speaking possibly to many outside observers' feelings about the space, said:  ""This is either the biggest scam or the most undervalued asset in humanity. It could still be either way.""

42429065,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrZph,1526156142,Congressional Candidate Vows to Gauge Voter Sentiment With Blockchain,"The crypto candidate – it has a nice ring to it.  And Brian Forde, former head of MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, is making that his new title. The author of the White House memo on bitcoin during the Obama administration, Forde is looking to take his interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to higher office – California’s 45th District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, to be exact.  Forde said during the Ethereal Summit in Queens, NY, on May 12 that he is running for office on a platform of bridging the gap between Congress and the crypto community. He first announced his campaign last July and is seeking to unseat incumbent Rep. Mimi Walters.  First and foremost, Forde's campaign accepts cryptocurrency donations – a rare move among candidates for national office but nothing new.  But what's particularly notable about Forde's mission is how he plans to use the technology – if elected – to help his constituents get their voices heard by recording their policy preferences on a blockchain.  Speaking to CoinDesk in a separate interview, Forde explained the rationale behind this plan.  ""If you're upset at your member of Congress, you call them, you fax them, you text them, you email them, and in theory, there's someone in the background, some intern – kind of chicken scratches on the wall – counting how people feel. Is that publicly auditable? No,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:    ""I'd be the first member of Congress to adopt blockchain voting to hear from my constituents about how they feel on the policies I'm about to vote on.""    Forde wouldn't necessarily hold himself to his constituents' decisions. But he said Saturday that ""what I want to do is create transparency for the voice of the citizen, so that if I do make a decision that's not consistent with what all the votes said, then I've got to explain myself.""  A 'helpful ambassador'  But what's perhaps more beneficial – especially to the tech-savvy blockchain community – is that Forde would be a knowledgeable representative that could communicate the industry's mission to sitting members of Congress.  Few people in Congress are technologically adept, Forde contended, a fact that was ""clearly on display"" during Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's testimony after the social media giant's recent scandal whereby third-party companies were collecting user's private data.  This lack of understanding threatens to stifle innovation, Forde said – or push it out of the country entirely.  At a recent meeting with blockchain and cryptocurrency entrepreneurs in his district, he learned ""their biggest fear is that they're not going to be able to start or run their companies here in the United States because the regulatory structure is very uncertain today.""  Not that the politicians deserve all the blame. When he worked at the White House, he said, ""you had policymakers who didn't understand technology and you had technologists who didn't understand policy.""  His role, Forde said, was to be a ""helpful ambassador.""  A few years on, he sees similar communication breakdowns everywhere he looks. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have divergent approaches, he said. Meanwhile, states are passing their own laws, not all of them helpful – New York's Bitlicense, he pointed out, caused businesses to leave the state.  ""People in the various areas"" – business, technology, government – ""aren't speaking the same language, and so they're talking past each other,"" he said. He offered this example:    ""When people say 'blockchain not bitcoin,' I head for the hills, man.""

42429062,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrZjh,1526155834,IBM Is Helping Build a Carbon Credit Blockchain Token,"IBM is collaborating with environmental technology firm Veridium Labs to launch a token with the goal of shaking up the carbon credits industry.  Veridium, whose plan to issue the so-called verde was revealed last year, isn’t the first token-related project to land IBM as a partner, but it could prove to be one of the most consequential.  Their collaboration also builds on IBM’s previous relationship with Stellar, which was unveiled last October with a cross-border payments initiative that used Stellar’s lumens token as a medium of exchange.  Veridium’s verde token runs on the Stellar network and is backed by Triple Gold REDD+ credits, or carbon credits issued by a company called Infinite Earth. Infinite Earth oversees the Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve, a 64,000-hectare-large area in Borneo. The reserve serves as the “natural capital” for the carbon credits and is home to a number of endangered species.  At the heart of the carbon credit concept is the idea that real change can be affected by relying on market forces to push down the total amount of pollutive materials companies produce. The credits, which companies can purchase, function as a kind of tradeable permit, each worth a ton of carbon.  REDD is short for Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, and it focuses squarely on the carbon emissions created by deforestation. More than 60 countries are party to the REDD framework, spread across the Asia-Pacific region, Africa and South America.  Yet according to Todd Lemons, a co-founder and the CEO of Veridium, the process of actually measuring the carbon impact of each foot of forest can be cumbersome. In the company’s years of work, there was always a need for a different tool to streamline the process and improve transparency, Lemons said.  And that’s where blockchain comes in, he said.  “We’ve developed a new set of protocols to take a completely different approach, to create a set of calculations that measure the footprint per dollar. So that set of protocols is being codified into the verde token,” Lemons told CoinDesk, going on to say of the token:  “It represents the underlying asset, the environment asset, as well as completely automates the carbon accounting and offsetting process to make it infinitely more consumable for companies to be able to integrate that into their transactions.”  Carbon on the blockchain  Running on the Stellar network allows for some key benefits, according to Jared Klee, blockchain offering manager for IBM and the company’s point person on the initiative.  Among those is the ability to swap those tokens directly, rather than relying on an exchange platform that would be vulnerable to hacking or other issues.  “Stellar has built in a decentralized exchange which, among other things, helps mitigate central points of failure,” Klee explained.  More broadly, he contended, using a blockchain brings transparency that's been lacking in this market. As Transparency International wrote back in 2012, accounting for carbon can be problematic – thus making it more susceptible to fraud.  “Given the remoteness of REDD+ sites there may be no easy way of knowing whether a project is authentic or bogus,” the group wrote at the time.  This is why IBM sees an auditable shared ledger adding value to the process. As Klee told CoinDesk:  “Blockchain plays a critical role in ... enabling the transparency so that individuals interested in purchasing, trading and using the token have visibility into the underlying carbon credits that back the token.""

42401535,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczwHc,1526148052,Ex-JP Morgan Blockchain Lead Hints at Stealth Startup Vision,"Everyone is waiting for Amber Baldet's big reveal.  Since leaving her role as the blockchain lead at JP Morgan last month, Baldet has been tight-lipped on the new company she plans to launch. Still, her presentation at Ethereal Summit Friday, hosted by ethereum startup incubator ConsenSys, hinted at what the new endeavor might entail.  There, Baldet criticized the tribalism that can occur between builders of open blockchain networks and institutions, stressing the importance of hybrid technologies that can deploy verifiable, open-source code resistant to single points of failure but that can be adjusted should exceptions happen.  Hybrid blockchains have been on the minds of many executives at major enterprises of late, and Baldet's interest comes after the two largest public protocols have been embroiled, if not trapped, in online feuds.  As such, she framed permissioned blockchains as perhaps offering a well-intentioned contrast to a model that's seen no shortage of critiques over the years.  Baldet said:  “You can change the rules of the game without fighting on Twitter for two years. So, choices matter.”  Elsewhere, Baldet echoed much the same narrative of inclusion that the Ethereal Summit seemed to illustrate, while touching on the need for a better security models and poking fun at bitcoin's strategy for its security model and its emphasis on inclusion through node ownership.  In this way, Baldet framed herself as an entrepreneur who wants to forge a path toward a “pragmatic internet of value.""  “In other words, something that works,” she said.  Privacy is pivotal  And to create that internet of value, Baldet believes the question of privacy is perhaps the most crucial.  “Fundamental strong encryption is a requirement for these systems,” Baldet said, adding that such cryptography should be open source and intensely vetted.  While permissioned blockchains are often criticized for their management by central authorities, Baldet said, public blockchains tend to put the onus on the individual, and as such, aren't perfect solutions for users.  Though bitcoin is ideal as a peer-to-peer, censorship-resistant payment network, she also suggested that builders of other blockchains might need to seek alternative strategies concurrent with their visions.  ""Just because you have solved your problem set doesn’t mean you have solved the problems of everything else in the world,” she continued.  Building a system that has properties of both public and private blockchains, she seemed to stress, could prove beneficial for all parties.  Speaking to CoinDesk after her presentation, Baldet elaborated on this idea, stating that the ability to implement privacy solutions is one of the more interesting aspects of permissioned options.  She said:  “You can create privacy boundaries and it’s okay to have some things that are permissioned, because they’re things that at no point should be accessible to the entire public.”  'More dumb coordination'  Baldet didn't exactly state what such infrastructures would look like, but in conversation to CoinDesk, she hinted that it's unlikely to be achieved through options like interoperability protocols.  While interoperability is often cited as integral to blockchain adoption, Baldet said that forging connections between protocols could open up creating security vulnerabilities.  “A less optimal outcome would be to have a bunch of different public networks that all have different security and privacy models and completely agnostic interoperability between them,” Baldet said.  Because such a model relies too heavily on the security of these connections, it could risk harming the protocols to which they are attached.  Instead, she believes blockchains should be used for simple attestations that something has occurred, with the cryptographic hashes giving a compressed, yet computationally-verifiable sequence of what happened.

Developed by Gavin Wood, an ethereum co-founder and the founder of Parity Technologies, the technology aims to allow chains to communicate with each other, while also facilitating upgrades automatically without system-wide upgrades or hard forks.  While the interoperable elements are yet to be constructed, the PoC advances a building block within the Polkadot protocol that allows developers to build upon the system using this unique governance method.  ""It’s really the heart of Polkadot in a way, technologically,"" Jutta Steiner, the CEO of Parity Technologies, told CoinDesk.  The governance aspect of Polkadot will be available for testing on the ethereum-based Kovan testnet, the companies said. Wood also carried out a live demonstration at the Community Ethereum Development Conference (EDCON) earlier this month, in which he demonstrated how token holder votes – the key metric in assuring that changes occur – could be used for nefarious ends.  ""It's basically building that toolkit that you need to then develop a different parachain, to further build on the relay chain itself, but that all relies on that core engine,"" Steiner said of the newly released PoC.  She added:  ""Part of it is that you can start with an arbitrary governance mechanism, like state transition function, and change it live on-chain and even to a point where you kill it and no further blocks were added. That was what Gavin showed off at EDCON.""  Parity and Web3 said in a statement that the next Polkadot PoC will ""implement parachain candidate agreement and networking.""

42401534,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczwIb,1526138712,"At Ethereal Summit, A Human Face On A Blockchain Future","“Raise your hand if you don’t know what 'bitcoin mining' actually is.”  At an impromptu Q&A at Ethereal Summit on May 11, Consensys software engineer Ashoka Finley encouraged the audience to ask embarrassing questions they might have about cryptocurrency and blockchain.  ""What's 'hashing'? Don’t know what a bitcoin is?"" Finley went on, encouraging attendees.  The questions spoke to the sentiment on day one of the two-day conference hosted by the company, a Brooklyn-based ethereum startup incubator, characterizing the inclusive atmosphere CEO Joseph Lubin appeared to be aiming for with the whimsical conference set in New York City.  Indeed, there was no shortage of eager blockchain enthusiasts onhand to discuss how they hope blockchain can change society and the world.  While cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has so far been relegated to mostly to a community of techies, Lubin drove home the message of inclusion at a press conference around lunchtime. He told the group of a couple dozen members of the media that after attending a number of banking and trading conferences focusing on blockchain, he wanted to put on an event that “really spoke to normal people"" – to artists, musicians and others whose primary focus wasn’t blockchain.  He spoke about ways that the uninitiated could learn more about ethereum and blockchain technology, including a “stunning” amount of YouTube videos and ConsenSys’ own Academy offerings, plus Ethereal itself.  Appropriately for a conference hosted at a reclaimed glass factory in Queens, Lubin predicted that Silicon Valley’s dominance over the tech sector would wane, because “as we move forward having large pools of capital is going to become less valuable than having great ideas.”  Network decentralization, in other words, may lead to geographic decentralization, and with it, much needed change.  To that point, he stressed blockchain’s potential to restore ordinary people’s ownership of their personal data through projects such as uPort, an ethereum-based self-sovereign identity play. Rather than forking over massive amounts of data to centralized firms like Facebook, users could monetize their own information, selling it on marketplaces – but only if they want to.  That kind of message may once have appealed only to a cypherpunk fringe, but that seems no longer the case.  Speaking to that increased interest from outsiders, Lubin said:  “Cambridge Analytica is helping our case.”  Driving financial inclusion  True to the mission of inclusion, a number of talks focused on how cryptocurrencies could solve the ""financial inclusion"" problem.  “The conversation about this tech shouldn’t just be about U.S., China and Russia, because if it is, I’ll be really disappointed,” said Global Blockchain Business Council CEO Sandra Ro, whose talk focused on smaller, Caribbean islands who are looking to blockchain in various capacities.  She continued:  “I think we have an opportunity here to give the small guys a fighting chance.""  Along these lines, Tricia Martinez, the founder and CEO of Wala, which recently launched a crypto token, dala, painted a bleak picture of banking in Africa.  Unlike banks in the developing world which subsist off the traditional savings and loan model, she argued banks across Africa make their money by charging fees for every action a customer makes: opening accounts, buying a coffee, or, perhaps most jarringly, even inquiring about fraudulent activity in an account.  Given all that, it's no surprise most Africans aren't using banks at all – 94 percent of transactions on the continent are in cash, Martinez said.  While that works, cash might not be enough, she continued, pointing to digital money's obvious advantages as a fast-moving form of payment that can easily be sent across borders.  Speaking to CoinDesk in a separate interview, Martinez said the Wala mobile app (where dala is the native cryptocurrency) is trying to do everything the banks do, except without fees.  The company does this by sending the ERC-20 token across the micro-raiden network, a scaling technology launched in December that pushes transactions into channels off the ethereum blockchain.  So far it seems to be working. According to Martinez, there are 50,000 people currently using dala to top up on airtime, pay electricity bills or send money to friends and family.  ""Let's solve this financial inclusion problem,"" she said during her presentation.  Offsetting the abstract  Yet, it wasn't just the mainstage speakers that were pushing the idea that the cryptocurrency community should reach out to those not already versed in the technology.  The Knockdown Center has a number of different rooms and alcoves that the organizers used to showcase projects that are trying to bridge the gap between art and blockchain.  For instance, in an area called ""the crypt,"" ConsenSys showcased its Cellarius project – a collaborative sci-fi writing exercise (whereby anyone can participate by writing, drawing or rendering a piece of the story and then the community votes on its inclusion) that advances a new genre it calls ""blockpunk.""  “It's a bit more positive, it's not as dystopian as cyberpunk. There's room for hope in this world and a bigger emphasis on decentralization,"" Frank Apollo,a leading writer on the project, told CoinDesk.  Right outside the crypt was the meditation zone with massages and yoga sessions, intended to provide an antidote to the high velocity that is typical of industry conferences.  Artistic director for Ethereal, Saraswathi Subbaraman told CoinDesk that the creative side of the event emphasizes experiential, immersive artworks, to offset what is mostly an abstract industry.  “This space is so cerebral. It’s a high pressure, cerebral space,” Subbaraman said.  Subbaraman added that the featured artworks were selected for their critical value, which was divided into two fundamental themes. On the one hand, there was art that illustrates the potential of blockchain technology, for example, a project named ""Bail Bloc"" that mines monero in order to get people out of jail.  But there were works that spoke to the more dystopic aspects of the industry as well, such as a ""CryptoJacked"" popup shop for malware themed cryptocurrency mining solutions, and a handful of works that reflected on the occasionally cultish aspects of the industry.  “Art is a moment for critical pause,"" Subbaraman told CoinDesk. “I came to this space because I thought I heard 'human first,' but I’m not sure I heard correctly. Art can show us where we’re falling short so we can build better.”  Subbaraman's words seemed to echo those of Aya Miyaguchi, executive director at the Ethereum Foundation, who was the first to take the stage on day-one of Ethereal.  “Ethereum has a community that cares. The level of impact is still not all known but there is a lot of potential,"" she said, adding:  “It’s happening guys. It’s happening everywhere.”  Ethereal Summit images via CoinDesk",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,"Alyssa Hertig, David Floyd",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/12/at-ethereal-summit-a-human-face-on-a-blockchain-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bbd2f9f33a5a75af3dbe12b798e61c5a7225598c-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42401532,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczwEf,1526132736,Blockchain Security Takes Spotlight At NYC Innovation Summit,"“At its highest level, blockchain is a trust layer.”  In nine words, Kaleido Insights founding partner Jessica Groopman succinctly summarized the gist of CDX Academy’s “Blockchain Brand Innovation Summit” on May 11 during her opening remarks.  The summit itself brought together representatives from blockchain startups and incumbent institutions to debate and discuss different use cases for the technology, noting both its advantages and its flaws.  According to various panels, the obvious use for blockchain is in data storage, whether in healthcare or in other private, consumer data. The overreach of many centralized institutions as it relates to personal data, in particular, has made headlines recently, perhaps the most notable being third-party application's collection of Facebook users’ private information.  Speaking on a panel to the Facebook scandal, Christiana Cacciapuoti, vice president of partnerships and platform operations at Mad Hive said:  “I do see a fundamental shift, and especially with Facebook’s [recent disclosures], I think the average consumer is now more aware of how pervasive data collection is.""  Jeremy Balkin, head of U.S. innovation at HSBC Bank, echoed that, saying, blockchain adoption, in general, is being sped up by a lack of faith in existing systems.  Unlike Cacciapuoti who spoke to today's social media platforms, Balkin pointed to financial systems as an example, where people - in particular, millennials - are looking to the nascent technology as a way to protect their privacy and security.  But it's not just individuals that are hoping the technology provides a better security architecture for their digital lives, but also large corporates.  Gil Beyda, managing director at Comcast Ventures, said the telecommunications giant is looking into using distributed ledger technology for increased security, not only in preventing networks from being compromised but also in compartmentalizing the potential damage if a system is compromised.  Security holes  That said, many of the panelists were cautious about how far blockchain really goes to secure systems - at least at present.  For instance, McAfee chief consumer security evangelist Gary Davis warned that blockchain technology has a major flaw: though blockchain itself may be a secure technology, it is surrounded by security holes.  “It rides on the internet, so by definition you’re putting a technology on something that is proven to be very vulnerable, very prone to attack,"" he said.  He pointed to the recent MyEtherWallet hack, whereby attackers were able to drain $150,000 worth of users' ether through a vulnerability in the domain name servers the wallet was using.  On top of that, while many see the immutability of blockchains as an advantage, Comcast Venture's Beyda said that feature could become a major issue for people who store their identity or financial information on a platform.  “[Right now] it’s inconvenient if our identity is stolen, if our credit card is stolen, but we have mechanisms to recover that,"" he said. ""If you have a public-private key pair, and you lose that, it’s gone … if you have a private key, you have access to all of the resources.”  As such, he continued, “The first level of attack is not trying to crack the public-private keys, but to steal the private keys.”  Still, Beyda remained hopeful, saying the industry must be patient as the technologists ""catch up"" with business needs.  He concluded:  ""Blockchain is an amazing technology, and I believe it has the promise to disrupt some existing businesses.""
