33986780,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644512,1727307005,Crypto Analyst Identifies Cardano Buy Signal And Parabolic Rally To Send ADA Price To $5,"As the altcoin season approaches, Cardano (ADA) is gaining momentum, having recorded more than a 14% increase in the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Notably, a crypto analyst has identified a strong buy signal for ADA, suggesting that it could potentially set off a parabolic rally that might drive the price of Cardano to new all-time highs around $5. Cardano New Buy Signal To Trigger Rally To $5 On September 24, crypto analyst, TradingShot published a detailed analysis and report on Cardano’s price movements, centering on key technical indicators to predict the cryptocurrency’s future price. According to the analyst, Cardano is currently flashing one of the most powerful long-term buy signals possible on the weekly time frame. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Symmetrical Triangle Pattern Reappears, Why A 200% Rally Is Possible Based on this strong buy signal and other technical indicators, the crypto analyst predicts that Cardano could begin a new parabolic rally in the coming weeks. The expectation is that the higher highs trend line will set a resistance level for ADA’s price movements, potentially catalyzing an increase to $5. Highlighting these technical indicators, TradingShot revealed that Cardano’s 1W Logarithmic Moving Average Convergence Divergence (LMACD) is finally forming a bullish cross. In Cardano’s case, this bullish cross is the first formed since October 9, 2023, and is currently signaling a strong buy signal that could push ADA towards an uptrend. Moving on, Cardano’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of an asset’s price movements, has been “ranging” since May 2024. This means that the cryptocurrency has been trading below the 1W 50-period Moving Average (MA50) on the weekly chart. Based on these key technical indicators, TradingShot has drawn a parallel between the previous crypto bull cycle and Cardano’s recent price movements. He observed that ADA’s current market conditions were almost the same as during the 2021 bull cycle. At the time, a bullish Megaphone appeared on a 1W LMACD bullish cross, followed by a bottom formation triggered by a 1W MA50/MA100 bullish cross while the 1W RSI was in a consolidation phase. As a result, the analyst has suggested that these recurring technical indicators were a signal that Cardano may be gearing up for a massive price rally. He boldly forecasted that ADA would rise from its current price of $0.38 to $5, marking its next top for this bull cycle. Analyst Says “ADA Will Hit $1 Before Christmas” In contrast to TradingShot’s ambitious $5 price prediction for ADA, another crypto analyst, identified as ‘Deezy.eth’ on X (formerly Twitter), has offered a more conservative outlook for the cryptocurrency. Deezy.eth predicts that Cardano will hit $1 before December 25, 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Prediction: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why $100,000 Is The Nominal Price Level For 2025 The analyst has grounded his optimistic projections on several factors which he considers bullish propellants for Cardano.This includes ADA’s weekly time frame bullish divergence, the start of rate cuts after four years, the recent launch of the Cardano Chang hard fork and the reduced appeal of ADA’s “low float, and high FDV.” Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | FORKS,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-buy-parabolic-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

33984381,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644581,1727301604,Bitcoin Correlation With Gold Now At Highest Level Since March,"Data shows Bitcoin has been becoming increasingly correlated with Gold, a potential sign that the digital Gold narrative is making a return. Bitcoin Correlation With Gold Has Risen To 0.75 Recently In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock discussed the latest trend in Bitcoin’s Correlation to Gold. The “Correlation” here is a metric that tracks how closely related the prices of two given assets are. In the current case, of course, the assets are BTC and Gold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Top At $400,000 Based On This Model, Analyst Says When the value of this metric is positive, it means BTC is reacting to movements in the Gold price by moving in the same direction. The closer is the indicator to the 1 mark, the stronger is this relationship. On the other hand, the metric being under zero suggests that, although there is some correlation present, it’s a negative one. In other words, the two assets are moving in the opposite direction to each other. The -1 level plays the role of the extreme in this case. The Correlation can also assume a value exactly equal to zero, indicating that there is no relationship between the prices of the assets whatsoever. In statistics, the variables satisfying this condition are said to be independent. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Correlation to Gold since the start of the year 2024: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Correlation to Gold had slumped to the lowest point for the year in July, but since then, the metric has been steadily moving up. The indicator now has a value of 0.75, which suggests there is a notable positive relationship between the assets. From the chart, it’s apparent that this is the highest that the metric has been since March. “Bitcoin’s rising correlation over the past months aligns with investors’ recession fears and lack of confidence in the dollar,” notes the analytics firm. “This flight to safety highlights Bitcoin’s evolving role in macroeconomic hedging.” The Correlation can be a useful indicator to follow for investors looking for diversification options for their portfolios. In general, assets with a high value of the indicator may not be ideal options to keep together, like Bitcoin and Gold right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Is At A Critical Retest: Can Bulls Triumph? IntoTheBlock has pointed out, however, that Ethereum‘s Correlation to Gold is still minimal at the moment, implying that ETH’s role in the market is different from BTC’s. As for what it is, the analytics firm comments: Ethereum’s limited correlation with gold points to its position as a more speculative, growth-driven asset. Its price movements are less influenced by external economic factors and more driven by the underlying ecosystem such as DeFi activity & staking.

According to CoinMarketCap data, the world’s most valuable coin is changing hands above $63,500, steady on the last day and up a decent 7% over the previous week of trading. Technically, the uptrend remains as long as prices stay above the support zone at around $58,000 and $60,000. Bitcoin Up 30% From August Lows, RSI Dips Below 80% Level In The Monthly Chart At press time, traders are upbeat and optimistic, which could form the base of another leg up. So far, since the dip in early August, Bitcoin is up 30% and retesting August highs at around $65,000. However, there are high expectations that buyers will push prices above this level, marking another phase for confident bulls, a development in the monthly chart is worth noting. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Top At $400,000 Based On This Model, Analyst Says Taking to X, the analyst notes that as bulls struggle to break above $65,000 and print a fresh 2-month high, the upside momentum seems to be fading. At press time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the monthly chart is falling, recently breaking below the 80%. Typically, the zone between 80% and 100% marks the upper limit of the oscillator, denoting that the coin is overvalued or in the overbought territory. With the RSI falling, it can be interpreted that the upside momentum is down, which is a net negative for bulls. Since this is printed out in the monthly chart, it could have serious consequences in the daily and lower time frames. It can hint that cracks are forming, and sellers may be preparing to push lower, especially if bulls fail to break above $65,000. There Is Hope, BTC Will Likely Spike Once Prices Race Above $73,000 Bearish as this may be, there is hope. The analyst observes that though the RSI is below the 80% mark, this is not the first time. On multiple occasions, Bitcoin prices recover steadily when the RSI falls to this level. Nonetheless, this doesn’t happen all the time. As this is a concern, traders should closely monitor how price action pans out in the coming days. A drop toward the $60,000 mark will pour cold water into the current momentum, signaling the start of a possible correction. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Reclaims Top 10 Crypto Spot, Analysts Set New Targets Even with this outlook, the analyst is bullish. In a separate post, the analyst said if Bitcoin shakes off weakness and climbs towards $73,000, the coin may rally strongly. When this happens, the analyst expects a new influx of fresh liquidity, especially in the futures market. The inflow, in turn, could drive prices to new levels, perhaps even above all-time highs. All the same, before this happens, BTC needs to gather momentum. This surge will happen, especially if there is a decisive close above the $65,000 resistance line.

It consumes vast amounts of power and data, with estimates of 460 terawatt hours in 2022 that are projected to increase sharply by 2026 to somewhere between 620 and 1,050 TWh. But, its most voracious demand is for compute: the processing power that fuels the training of complex models, the analysis of massive datasets, and the execution of large-scale inferences.  This computational hunger has reshaped many of our professional landscapes. In 2024, the global AI market surpassed $184 billion, with projections suggesting it could pass $800 billion by 2030 – a value comparable to the current GDP of Poland. ChatGPT, the industry’s most well-known product, famously reached 100 million active users within just two months of its launch in November 2022.  Yet, as AI products like ChatGPT multiply and grow, our perception of how AI operates is quickly becoming outdated. The popular image of AI – with sprawling data centers, enormous energy bills, and controlled by tech giants – no longer tells the whole story. This view has led many to believe that meaningful AI development is the exclusive domain of well-funded corporations and major tech companies.  A new vision for AI is emerging, one that looks to the untapped potential in our pockets. This approach aims to democratize AI by harnessing the collective power of billions of smartphones worldwide. Our mobile devices spend hours idle each day, their processing capabilities dormant. By tapping into this vast reservoir of unused compute power, we could reshape the AI landscape. Instead of relying solely on centralized corporate infrastructure, AI development could be powered by a global network of everyday devices.  Untapped potential  Smartphones and tablets represent an enormous, largely untapped reservoir of global compute power. With 1.21 billion units predicted to be shipped in 2024 alone, the true potential of spare compute this offers is hard to, well, compute.  Initiatives like Theta EdgeCloud for mobile aims to harness this distributed network of consumer-grade GPUs for AI computation. This shift from centralized computing to edge computing is a technical evolution that is capable of completely reinventing the way people interact with and power AI models.  By processing data locally on mobile devices, the industry stands to achieve far lower latency, enhanced privacy, and reduced bandwidth usage. This approach is particularly crucial for real-time applications like autonomous vehicles, augmented reality and personalized AI assistants. The edge is where new AI use cases will take off, especially those for personal usage. Not only will powering these programs become more affordable on the edge, but it will also become more reactive and customizable, a win-win for consumers and researchers alike.  Blockchains are designed perfectly for this distributed AI ecosystem. Their decentralized nature aligns seamlessly with the goal of harnessing idle compute power from millions of devices worldwide. By leveraging blockchain technology, we can create a secure, transparent, and incentivized framework for sharing computational resources.  The key innovation here is the use of off-chain verification. While on-chain verification would create bottlenecks in a network of millions of parallel devices, off-chain methods allow these devices to work together seamlessly, regardless of individual connectivity issues. This approach enables the creation of a trustless system where device owners can contribute to AI development without compromising their security or privacy.  This model draws on the concept of ""federated learning,"" a distributed machine learning method that can scale to vast amounts of data across mobile devices while protecting user privacy. Blockchain provides both the infrastructure for this network and the mechanism to reward participants, incentivizing widespread engagement.  The synergy between blockchain and edge AI is fostering a new ecosystem that's more resilient, efficient, and inclusive than traditional centralized models. It's democratizing AI development, allowing individuals to participate in and benefit from the AI revolution directly from their mobile devices.  Overcoming tech challenges  AI training and inference can be done on a range of GPU types, including consumer grade GPUs in mobile devices. The hardware that powers our mobile devices has been steadily improving since smartphones hit the market, and shows no signs of slowing down. Industry leading mobile GPUs such as Apple’s A17 Pro and Qualcomm’s Adreno 750 (used in high-end Android devices like Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel) are redefining what AI tasks can be completed on mobile devices.  Now, new chips known as Neural Processing Units (NPUs) are being produced that are specifically designed for consumer AI computation, enabling on-device AI use cases while managing the heat and battery power limitations of mobile devices. Add intelligent system design and architecture that can route jobs to the optimal hardware for that job, and the created network effect will be extremely powerful.  While the potential of edge AI is immense, it still comes with its own set of challenges. Optimizing AI algorithms for the diverse array of mobile hardware, ensuring consistent performance across varying network conditions, addressing latency issues, and maintaining security are all critical hurdles. However, ongoing research in AI and mobile technology are steadily addressing these challenges, paving the way for this vision to become reality.  Corporations to communities  One of the biggest complaints, and most just, as it relates to the development of AI is the incredible amount of power it consumes. Large data centers also require huge swaths of land for their physical infrastructure, and incredible amounts of power to stay online. The mobile model can alleviate many of these environmental impacts by using spare GPU in pre-existing devices – rather than relying on GPU in centralized data centers – is more efficient, and will produce less carbon emissions. The potential impacts as it relates to our environment cannot be understated.  The shift to edge computing in AI will also fundamentally change who can participate in supporting AI networks and who can profit off them. The corporations that own the data centers will no longer be in a walled garden. Instead, the gates will be open and access will be proliferated for individual developers, small businesses, and even hobbyists that will be empowered to run AI networks.  Empowering a much larger pool of users and supporters will also enable more rapid and open development, helping to curb the much discussed and much feared idea of stagnation in the industry. This increase in accessibility will also lead to more diverse applications, addressing niche problems and underserved communities that may be otherwise overlooked.  The economic impact of this shift will be profound. By allowing individuals and small to medium sized organizations to monetize their devices' idle computing power, new revenue streams will run deep. It also opens up new markets for consumer-grade AI hardware and edge-optimized software.  The future of AI innovation lies not in building larger data centers, but in harnessing the power that already exists in our pockets and homes. By shifting focus to edge computing, a more inclusive, efficient, and innovative AI ecosystem can emerge. This decentralized approach not only democratizes AI but also aligns with global sustainability goals, ensuring that the benefits of AI are accessible to all, not just a privileged few.

33979750,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644511,1727290804,"Ethereum Whales Spend $185 Million To Accumulate 70,000 ETH, Time To Buy?","Ethereum has largely mirrored Bitcoin in terms of price action and has yet to break out on its own accord in the past few months. According to price data, Ethereum is up by 13% in the past seven days, outpacing Bitcoin’s increase of 5.8% in the same time frame. Behind this interesting increase in Ethereum are some large Ethereum holders who seem to be increasing their holdings. Notably, on-chain data from multiple analytics platform points to an uptick in activity from Ethereum whales in the past few days. Particularly, Glassnode data suggests large holders of Ethereum have added at least 70,000 ETH into their wallets since the beginning of last week. Ethereum Whales Spend Big On ETH The interesting Ethereum whale activity noted above is revealed through on-chain analytics platform Glassnode. As shown in the chart below, the number of Ethereum wallets holding 10,000 ETH or more has experienced a rise in the last 24 hours, increasing to 925 wallets. This marks a gain of about seven new whale wallets that have accumulated a huge number of ETH tokens, up from the 918 wallets recorded on September 18. Related Reading: Bitcoin Prediction: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why $100,000 Is The Nominal Price Level For 2025 Supporting this trend, additional data from IntoTheBlock (ITB) indicates a surge in activity from addresses holding substantial amounts of Ethereum. ITB tracks these movements through a specific metric that monitors the number and value of transactions exceeding $100,000. According to this metric, Ethereum whale activity has reached over $29 billion in the past seven days. While this figure accounts for both inflows and outflows from whale wallets, the sheer scale of these transactions is notable. Historically, such high levels of activity from large holders tend to be a bullish indicator for cryptocurrencies. This heightened activity is further reflected in the inflows of ETH into large holder wallets. On September 23, these inflows soared to 515,520 ETH, representing an impressive 440% spike compared to the 95,820 ETH recorded during the previous 24-hour period. Time To Buy ETH? At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,626. As noted earlier, this is on the back of a 13% increase in the past seven days, prompting Ethereum’s overperformance over Bitcoin for the first time since the beginning of the year. The leading altcoin has mirrored Bitcoin’s movements so consistently that some analysts have questioned its potential for decoupling anytime soon.

That's why Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump's visit last week to a beloved Bitcoin bar in New York appeared so well timed – to repair any lost credibility after he and his family started promoting a decentralized-finance project that appears rooted in other blockchain ecosystems.  ALSO:  Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Kamala Harris's policy is ""N/A.""  Telegram's turnabout.  EXCLUSIVE: Huddle01, a video-conferencing blockchain project taking on Zoom, aims to sell as much as $37 million of ""media nodes.""

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Network news  Screenshot of the Zaprite invoice used by Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump to buy burgers and Diet Cokes at the bar PubKey in New York (PubKey/X)  LESSER EVILISM – It goes without saying that many Bitcoin purists do not like to mingle their business, politics or even company with users of other blockchains or cryptocurrencies. Which is partly why the Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump garnered so much scorn from Bitcoiners last week for promoting a very-much-NOT-Bitcoin decentralized-finance project, World Liberty Financial – complete with its own token, and a pre-mined allocation to insiders. ""Trump launching a sh*tcoin may have been the final straw to lose my vote,"" tweeted Bitcoin-friendly author Mitchell Askew. Responses on the thread ranged from total agreement to what one might call lesser evilism – the rhetorical contrast of one bad option with an even worse option: ""True but it’s that or WW3 with commie Kamala,"" wrote @FrictionlessBTC.  The DeFi dalliance threatened to undo much of the goodwill Trump built up at the Bitcoin Nashville conference in July, when he tossed out a series of red-meat pledges, including commuting the rest of Silk Road creator Ross Ulbrecht's life sentence and creating a ""strategic national bitcoin stockpile."" Multiple standing ovations ensued.  So it was fortuitous timing for Trump that his campaign scheduled a stop, later in the week, at the Bitcoin-friendly New York City bar, PubKey. According to the bar's official X account, Trump bought 50 smash burgers and Diet Cokes for people in attendance, at a total cost of $998.77 including tax and tip, and then paid for it all in bitcoin. Fox News posted a video of the entire scene, leading a sharp-eyed reporter from CryptoSlate to quickly point out that Trump's role mainly consisted of standing by at the counter while handlers actually performed the transaction, passing smartphones back and forth between them. Whatever. The bar crowd cheered. ""Crypto burgers!"" Trump said as he handed them out. A voice from behind the camera corrected him, ""Bitcoin burgers!""  As much as it was a second chance for Trump to prove his Bitcoin bona fides, the choreographed transaction served as a sort of benchmark for the blockchain's evolution as a viable payments option for a retail-facing business in the U.S. Will Cole, head of product at the Bitcoin payments app Zaprite (who happens to be Bitcoin-friendly U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis's son-in-law), described what he called the ""Trump stack:"" PubKey, running a node on Bitcoin's Lightning Network on Voltage Cloud, used Zaprite to provide an invoice for the purchase, and Trump paid using a Strike wallet. (Official spokespeople for the Trump campaign didn't respond to CoinDesk's email asking where the bitcoin originated from.)  Asked whether the episode might have helped erase any lingering disgust among Bitcoiners over the World Liberty Financial rollout, PubKey founder Thomas Pacchia didn't exactly dispute the premise of the question: ""The other stuff that the family has going on is sort of outside our purview and scope,"" he said in an interview. ""Everybody is on a journey toward understanding the difference between Bitcoin and crypto. I like to meet people where they are.""  ELSEWHERE:  Caroline Ellison exits a Manhattan courthouse after being sentenced to two years in prison on Sept. 24, 2024. (Victor Chen/CoinDesk)  Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison was sentenced to two years in prison by a federal judge on Tuesday. The judge said Ellison, 29, who will also have to forfeit about $11 billion, could serve the sentence at a minimum-security facility near Boston, where her family lives. Ellison was a key witness in the government’s trial against her former boyfriend, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy before being sentenced earlier this year to 25 years in prison.  Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris made her first remarks on crypto on Sunday before donors in New York City. (Her specific choice of term was ""digital assets."") A person with knowledge of the talks between her campaign and crypto insiders told CoinDesk that the discussions about digital-asset policy remain high-level and aren't likely to produce a detailed stance before the election in early November. Stand With Crypto, an advocacy group whose industry partners include exchanges Coinbase and Gemini as well as Filecoin developer Protocol Labs, issued a rating of ""N/A"" on Harris's crypto policies, for ""not enough information.""  Telegram, the instant-messaging app popular with crypto-industry pros, made significant changes to its terms of service, chief executive officer Pavel Durov said in a post on the app on Monday. The app’s privacy conditions now state that Telegram will now share a user’s IP address and phone number with judicial authorities in cases where criminal conduct is being investigated.  Crypto exchange BingX has been hacked for a ""minor"" amount of assets and the exchange plans to compensate users for any loss, the firm's chief product officer (CPO) said in a message on X. On-chain data suggests nearly $43 million was stolen from the exchange in multiple tranches, with $13.25 million ether, $2.3 million BNB, $4.4 million USDT, among other being drained.  Former Grammy-nominated artist and entrepreneur Iggy Azalea will release Motherland, a new online casino that uses her MOTHER token, in November. Azalea unveiled the project alongside business partner Joe McCann, founder of crypto investment firm Asymmetric, and manager Reece Pearson at her Motherland Rodeo event, at Breakpoint in Singapore last Friday.  Huddle01, Blockchain Video Conferencing Project That Seeks to Outdo Zoom, Targets $37M Node Sale  Huddle01 CTO Susmit Lavania, left, and CEO Ayush Ranjan, on a Huddle video conference call. (Huddle01)  Huddle01, a blockchain project to provide decentralized audio and video conferencing – aiming to provide lower latency virtual meetings than Zoom and Google Meet – plans to raise as much as $37 million in a sale of network nodes.  The 49,600 ""media nodes"" being sold offer operators a way to contribute excess internet bandwidth the communication network, in exchange for token rewards. According to a litepaper, some 21% of the project's HUDL tokens will be distributed to media nodes.  “These nodes will power a network that already outperforms the incumbent Web2 competitors on latency where there is a large cluster of nodes, and is capable of improving lags across the globe,” Huddle01 CEO Ayush Ranjan said in the release, shared exclusively with CoinDesk.  The project is built using technology borrowed from the Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum. A test network will launch two weeks after the sale completes, according to the press release.  Huddle01 becomes the latest in a growing trend of blockchain projects conducting node sales as a way to raise funds while simultaneously decentralizing their networks.

Diddy, Sam Bankman-Fried, and the Lure of High-Profile Cases for Attorneys","In an unprecedented turn of events, the worlds of hip-hop and cryptocurrency have collided behind bars, as P. Diddy, the rap mogul, finds himself sharing a cell with Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced crypto kingpin. It’s the kind of headline that would be dismissed as tabloid fodder — except it’s real. While the specifics of their alleged and convicted crimes differ dramatically, that two high-flying individuals could crash so spectacularly shows that no one is immune from accountability, no matter how much money or influence they wield.  The cellmate pairing is curious. Diddy, a cultural icon who redefined the music industry and expanded his empire into fashion, liquor, and entertainment, now has more in common with Bankman-Fried than he’d ever imagined. Bankman-Fried, once the face of crypto, now epitomizes its seedy potential. Their shared cell is a stark symbol of what happens when the wealth and fame that shielded them for so long finally crumble.  What’s also notable is the flock of attorneys now circling the high-profile cases of these men. High-powered attorneys love cases like this for a reason — they’re career-defining. Winning or even losing such cases ensures media attention and often leads to higher rates and bigger clients in the future. A celebrity client isn’t just a case; it’s a stage.  Legal teams will undoubtedly fight for the best outcomes for both Diddy and Bankman-Fried, but make no mistake, they are likely just as invested in their own notoriety. The spectacle of two different but equally high-profile figures sharing a jail cell only amplifies the prestige attached to these cases. For many lawyers, there’s a thrill in navigating the tension between public opinion and the law — and when their clients are household names, the stakes, and the rewards, are even higher.  In a world where public relations often overlap with legal strategy, high-profile cases like these are as much about shaping narratives as they are about verdicts. And in the court of public opinion, even a guilty man can still come out looking victorious — especially with the right attorney.  But beyond the headlines, the most important thing from a societal perspective is that we don’t see an Jeffrey Epstein repeat where the alleged co-perpetrators are kept protected from view indefinitely. The world needs to know who are major decision-makers potentially captive to blackmail for heinous misdeeds. Here’s hoping the media can keep from getting distracted by the hype and keep pressing for full disclosure this time around.

The token has climbed over 20% from its recent local lows, now testing a crucial supply level around $150. Related Reading: XRP $0.60 Triangle Breakout Could Ignite Parabolic Rally – Key Levels To Watch This resistance zone has drawn the attention of analysts and investors, with many believing Solana is on the verge of a rally to higher price levels. Among those who are bullish on SOL is prominent analyst Carl Runefelt, who recently shared a detailed analysis, predicting that Solana could reach new highs within days if the current momentum continues. As the broader market continues to gain strength, investors are eagerly awaiting Solana’s next move. A successful breakout above $150 could signal a confirmed uptrend, paving the way for a potential rally. However, the coming days will be pivotal for SOL as it approaches this key level, with the market closely watching whether it will reclaim higher ground or face renewed resistance. Solana Bullish Pattern About To Break Solana (SOL) is currently testing crucial supply levels that could pave the way for a significant rally to higher prices. After days of consolidation, the altcoin looks ready to break out and confirm a daily uptrend. Many analysts and investors are closely watching for the next move. This potential shift comes as the entire crypto market has turned from fear to optimism, spurred by the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to cut interest rates, which has breathed new life into the market. Analyst Carl Runefelt, one of the prominent voices in the crypto space, has shared his technical analysis on X, revealing that Solana has formed a symmetrical pattern. According to Runefelt, if SOL breaks out of this pattern, it could trigger a substantial upward move, with price targets around $160. The symmetrical triangle, a key technical formation, typically signals a strong price movement after a prolonged period of consolidation. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Surge 1,000% Past ATH – Price Targets Revealed As Solana hovers near this critical level, the market eagerly awaits confirmation of a breakout. Investors expect a move above $150, confirming the uptrend and likely leading to higher price levels in the coming weeks. For now, all eyes remain on Solana’s ability to break through this resistance and potentially rally to new heights. SOL Technical Analysis: Price Levels To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $150 after testing the daily 200 moving average (MA) at $154 as resistance. This key technical level has kept the price in check, and SOL is now entering a consolidation phase. Investors are optimistic, and rising demand could soon trigger a breakout from this consolidation. To keep momentum, SOL must reclaim the 1D 200 MA and target new highs beyond $164. This price has worked as a crucial resistance; if broken, it would confirm the continuation of a daily uptrend. A successful breakout at this level could push SOL toward even higher prices, potentially setting the stage for a run to challenge its all-time highs. Related Reading: SUI Price Sits 40% Below All-Time High As TVL Approaches $1 Billion However, failure to break above the daily 200 MA could signal a shift in sentiment. In this case, SOL could retrace to key support levels, with potential targets around $140 or even lower. This would indicate a short-term correction before another attempt at reclaiming higher price levels. Investors are closely watching SOL’s next moves to determine the coin’s near-term direction.

42407543,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQL3h,1727280489,The Galois Capital Settlement Signals a New Era for Digital Asset Custody,"In September 2024, Galois Capital, a now defunct crypto hedge fund, settled with the SEC for $225,000 over “custody failures” related to safeguarding clients’ crypto assets. While the amount may seem small, the implications for the Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) community, digital asset industry and custodians are significant.  This case marks a pivotal moment in how digital asset custody is and will be regulated, and signals the SEC’s intention to bring crypto custody further under federal jurisdiction.  The SEC’s release on Galois Capital set forth that the hedge fund failed to ensure crypto assets were held with a qualified custodian, violating the Investment Advisers Act’s Custody Rule. Galois Capital improperly custodied assets at FTX, which held a South Dakota state trust license and was deemed “not a qualified custodian” by the SEC.  When FTX collapsed, customers lost access to their funds that were commingled with FTX’s assets.  The SEC’s Custody Rule has long been in place to protect investors’ funds by mandating RIAs custody funds and assets with a custodian that maintains segregation between client and firm assets. For decades, this rule applied primarily to traditional financial assets, but the rise of digital assets prompted the SEC to highlight its oversight over this new domain.  In 2023, the SEC proposed formal amendments to the Custody Rule to explicitly cover digital assets. While these changes are not yet finalized, the Galois Capital case demonstrates that the SEC is already holding firms accountable for not custodying crypto assets through a qualified custodian.  The message is clear: RIAs (registered investment advisors) managing digital assets must take immediate steps to align with the SEC’s custody standards or face similar disciplinary actions.  Qualified custodians: state vs. federal oversight  This raises the question of what constitutes a “qualified custodian” in the digital asset space? According to the SEC’s Proposed Safeguarding Rule, “A qualified custodian generally is a federal or state-chartered bank or savings association, certain trust companies, a registered broker-dealer, a registered futures commission merchant, or certain foreign financial institutions (“FFI”).” Many non-depository trust companies claim on their websites that they are “qualified custodians.” But many fail to specify whether this is a claim under state law or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940/SEC Custody Rule.  Read more: Nathan McCauley - What an SEC Proposal Means for RIAs in Crypto  Unfortunately, there isn’t a clear distinction of what licenses grant “qualified custodian” status under state or federal law as it’s up to the custodian to meet the threshold prescribed in the SEC’s Custody Rule. More concerning, RIAs may only realize they are using a non-qualified custodian when the SEC takes action against them, or the custody provider’s business falters.  This was the case for Prime Trust, a Nevada-chartered trust company that touted itself as a Qualified Custodian dating back to 2019. In 2023, it was found that Prime Trust was using money from customer accounts to cover millions in losses resulting from a combination of account mismanagement and a market downturn. The company would later declare bankruptcy. In the Galois example, FTX’s South Dakota state trust license came under the SEC’s scrutiny only after clients' funds were lost.  Ultimately, the strength of any custodial license is only as strong as regulators’ abilities to oversee the actions of the custodian, putting the burden of due diligence squarely on the RIA.  What RIAs need to do now  For RIAs managing digital assets, the Galois Capital settlement offers several clear takeaways:  Review Custody Arrangements: Custody standards, and the licenses that uphold them, are changing. Review current relationships to understand the requirements your custodial partner is required to follow, and the strength of the associated regulatory body.  Where Would You Keep Your Money?: Seek out custodians considered the 'gold standard' in the eyes of the law, or those that are held accountable by the resources federal agencies bring to the table.  Reassess Self-Custody Risk: We know the mantra: not your keys, not your coins. Self-custodying assets introduces risks such as human error, and may no longer be a viable option as federal oversight increases.  While the Galois Capital case highlights the potential pitfalls of improper custody practices, it also presents an opportunity for RIAs. As the SEC clarifies its expectations around digital asset custody, firms that proactively adopt the “gold standard” of custody can differentiate their digital asset offerings to clients while reducing the risk of SEC enforcement action.

33975219,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644471,1727280039,SUI Eyes $1.45 Retest Following Breakout: Will Bulls Defend Support?,"SUI is on the brink of a key moment as it prepares to retest the $1.45 level following a successful breakout. The recent surge has positioned the cryptocurrency for a crucial test, where the bulls must step in to defend this newfound support. With the breakout still fresh and momentum hanging in the balance, the battle between bulls and bears continues to intensify. Can the bulls maintain control and solidify $1.45 as a foundation for further gains, or will selling pressure push SUI back into retreat? The aim of this analysis is to assess SUI’s potential as it approaches the critical retest of the $1.45 level after a strong breakout. We’ll explore the key technical signals, market sentiment, and the strength of bullish sentiment to determine whether the bulls can successfully defend this support. Technical Analysis: Key Indicators Point To $1.45 Retest Despite SUI’s price trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, the cryptocurrency is undergoing a noticeable pullback, aiming to retest the $1.45 level. This suggests that the recent bullish strength may be slowing down as traders reassess key support and resistance zones. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a potential price decline toward $1.45 as the RSI line is dropping from the overbought zone toward the 50% threshold, indicating that SUI’s upbeat momentum may be losing strength. Related Reading: SUI Rises 8% Amid Market Retrace, Will The Joy Be Short-Lived? Also, on the daily chart, SUI is showing bearish momentum as it attempts to retest the $1.45 mark. There have not been any notable declines in the price since it broke above the 100-day SMA, which implies that a correction might be approaching. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a closer analysis of the RSI signal line reveals a drop to 72% after previously peaking above 77%. This decline from overbought levels indicates that bullish momentum is waning, potentially signaling the beginning of a price consolidation or correction. The Road Ahead: What A Successful Retest Could Mean For SUI A successful retest of the $1.45 support level could mark a pivotal moment for SUI, potentially setting the stage for further upward movement. If the bulls manage to defend this key level, SUI may aim for higher resistance points, with targets like $2.18 and beyond coming into focus. Related Reading: SUI Price Sits 40% Below All-Time High As TVL Approaches $1 Billion However, should SUI fail to hold the $1.45 support level, it could trigger a deeper correction toward the next key support at $1.22. A breach of this level might signal a shift in the trend, possibly accelerating additional downside moves and completing a bearish reversal. At the time of writing, SUI was trading at approximately $1.74, marking a 13.14% increase over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalization was around $4.6 billion, with trading volume exceeding $1 billion, reflecting increases of 13.14% and 70.81%, respectively.

Gambaryan is being held as a representative of the company he works for, with prosecutors trying him on money laundering charges brought against Binance. He is being held in the Kuje Prison, which is notorious for holding terrorists and other criminals, where his health has deteriorated heavily; in a recent video, he was struggling to walk with a crutch. A spokesperson for his family said he has also suffered multiple infections, as well as a herniated disc in his back.  Despite this, the U.S. government only publicly acknowledged his detention earlier this month, though Secretary of State Antony Blinken has discussed Gambaryan with Nigerian officials in May, the New York Times reported.  Amanda Wick, a former federal prosecutor and government investigator who organized the protest, noted that Gambaryan used to work for the U.S. government.  Prior to his role at Binance, Gambaryan was an investigator with the IRS's Criminal Investigation wing.  ""America has fought harder for people who committed crimes [in the countries they were detained in] than for someone who fought for his country,"" Wick said.  Nigeria prosecuting someone to get the attention of their employer is ""truly unjust,"" said Chris Tyrrell, the chief risk and compliance officer at Ondo Finance.  Gary Weinstein, the founder of Infinity Advisory LLC and former state assistant attorney general, said all of the attendees present were in favor of consumer protections and ""high-integrity"" markets, including Gambaryan. He noted that Gambaryan had been invited by the Nigerian government when he visited in February and was given a ""false assurance of safe passage.""  ""One cannot do their job if one is in fear of getting snatched by a nation-state,"" he said.

While Asia has greater user adoption, the U.S. is still the more influential geography.  Even so, the result of the U.S. presidential election in November ""won't matter much.""  SINGAPORE — Stablecoins will drive institutional adoption in Asia, ""even if regulators are not happy with it,"" Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Michael Gronager said in an interview at Token2049 in Singapore. Yet, while more users in the region have leaped into cryptocurrency than elsewhere, the U.S. is still the industry's most influential geography.  Stablecoins, crypto tokens whose value is pegged to a real-world asset like the dollar or gold, underpin the crypto trading system. Also, because their value is fixed – or meant to be – they can be used as a store of value and a medium of exchange.  ""One of the things we have seen as the biggest trends in crypto right now, and probably the killer app, is something as mundane as stablecoins,"" he said. ""Two-thirds of all transactions in transaction volume on blockchains are stablecoins.""  Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics company, regularly releases reports on the state of crypto and its adoption across the world. The most recent listed five Asian countries in the top 10 of the Global Adoption Index. India and Nigeria have kept the top two positions for two years in terms of grassroots crypto adoption, and Indonesia, a new No. 3, is the fastest growing.  ""Last year, one or two banks in Japan said they wanted to launch a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin within a year. It hasn't happened yet,"" Gronager said. ""I had conversations last week in Japan and now we have 10 banks wanting to launch such stablecoins.  ""Why hasn't it happened yet? (Because) banks are slow. They talk to the regulator.""  Regulators definitely have ""some level of concern"" and many things will need to be ironed out, he said. In the meantime, banks have to face growing competition from stablecoins when it comes to remittances, according to Gronager.  While Asia appears to dominate in terms of adoption, the U.S. which ranks fourth in the Chainalysis report, is the most influential region because that's where the trading volumes come from and the crypto economy looks to institutions like the U.S. Congress and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for big signals.  ""The real volume of crypto is tied to countries like the U.S. and others,"" Gronager said. ""The story we are trying to tell you is more like saying crypto users per capita. So basically, how many people using [crypto] within the country. The adoption is, like, who's holding crypto for the average people in countries. In the U.S., that's less than it is, for example, in India.""  Despite the regulatory influence and despite crypto influencers' focus on the U.S. presidential candidates' positions on the industry, the November election isn't a big deal, Gronager said.  ""It won't matter much,"" whether Donal Trump or Kamala Harris wins, Gronager predicted. ""Just getting on the other side"" of this election will be healthy for everyone.""

42407536,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQL0O,1727277598,"Unreliability, High Prices, and Security Breaches: Can DePIN Fix Telecom?","Despite its estimated size of over $3.1 trillionin 2024, today's telecom industry is facing financial, technological, and infrastructural sustainability challenges. As an average of 26% and 29% of households regularly experience unreliable Wi-Fi or broadband and mobile data in their homes, respectively, connectivity problems and service unreliability force people to miss out on opportunities. Regardless of the high rates of unreliability, customers have been paying expensive prices for telecom services, which have further increased due to inflationary pressure.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  The telecom industry is also facing a rising threat of security breaches, with a two-fold increase in confirmed security incidents between 2022 and 2023. In fact, the personal data of an estimated over 74 million US telecommunications clients was leaked on the dark web last year. Fortunately, DePIN can provide an effective way to tackle this ongoing challenge with a more resilient and distributed infrastructure that promotes reliable, cost-efficient, and scalable connectivity solutions for telcos.  How DePIN works in the telecom industry  With Messari estimating its total addressable market to be over $2.2 trillion today and exceeding $3.5 trillion by 2028, the DePIN sector decentralizes the ownership and control of real-world physical infrastructure via blockchain technology.  In the telecom industry, a DePIN solution could enable participants to provide network connectivity by purchasing and setting up antennas or hotspots. These devices are all connected to a decentralized network, where their operators receive token rewards in exchange for service coverage. Money is not printed out of thin air, as incentives are covered by the fees users pay for utilizing the network.  With crowdsourced infrastructure, providers don’t have to invest in the deployment and maintenance of new or existing hardware. Doing so helps telcos offload traffic from their current ecosystems without incurring further CapEx or operational expenditures (OpEx).  At the same time, additional coverage can be created for a fraction of the price of traditional services by incentivizing individuals and communities with token rewards. Obviously, the coverage of DePINs is currently limited compared to the massive networks of telco giants. However, given sufficient distribution, they have the potential to deliver equivalent service levels while offering cost-efficient prices for consumers and enterprise clients.  Since the community is in charge of infrastructure development, DePINs can scale more efficiently than traditional telecom networks. There is no need to sign lease agreements or evaluate whether it makes sense financially for the telco provider to extend its services to a new region. Instead, network participants will handle this task and bear its costs, making expansion feasible even to locations that have long been underserved by traditional infrastructures.  From the perspective of DePINs, their business model doesn’t necessarily involve direct competition with telecom providers. Instead, they can tap into telco giants’ established infrastructures to offer users a decentralized, resilient, and efficient telecom solution at a fraction of the costs of conventional solutions. Simultaneously, while telcos can use this opportunity to generate additional revenue, it allows DePINs to expand their networks, further lowering the costs and increasing service quality.  In fact, a collaborative model is more viable for DePINs in their early stages of development than a competitive one. Even after a couple of years of active infrastructure deployment, their connectivity and reliability won’t be able to match the established networks of telco giants, which have been built and maintained for tens of years. This doesn’t mean that DePINs are slow to expand. On the contrary, it will take some time for them to survive on their own in the telecom market. So, for the time being, decentralized telecom networks will complement traditional telco infrastructures rather than replace them.  DePIN’s advantages over traditional telecom models  By embracing blockchain technology and decentralization, DePINs eliminate traditional telecom infrastructures' single points of failure, which attackers have repeatedly exploited in data breaches. Instead of a central server, data is distributed across thousands (if not millions) of devices in the ecosystem, making it extremely challenging and expensive to gain access to customers' records, install malware, or disrupt the network's stable operation in other ways.  The DePIN model is not just more secure, but it can also accelerate telecom infrastructure development. With the right token incentives, DePINs can deploy their networks at a substantially faster pace than conventional telcos, leading to more rapid expansion and improved service coverage over time. Designed to reward ecosystem participants for building and maintaining telecom infrastructure, these incentives make telecom infrastructure development less CapEx- and OpEx-heavy. In addition to distributing infrastructure deployment and maintenance across a decentralized network of participants, crowdsourcing hardware further reduces the costs of telcos.  DePINs can also fill service coverage gaps, especially in remote areas and locations where traditional infrastructure deployment and maintenance would be too expensive for providers. With crowdsourced hardware and token incentives, decentralized telecom networks can expand connectivity to these underserved regions as well. By joining forces, DePINs can significantly extend the coverage of telcos and enhance service reliability and network performance, as well as decrease the frequency of outages through an interconnected telecom network that encompasses both conventional and decentralized infrastructure solutions.  Are telcos ready to embrace DePIN?  As I see it, what poses the most significant barrier is onboarding traditional telcos into the Web3 ecosystem. Despite a history of embracing innovation and new technology, the telecom sector largely operates within the Web2 framework. To address this issue, DePIN providers must reduce Web3 complexities and streamline the onboarding process for telcos.  Infrastructure deployment presents another challenge for DePINs. Many organizations within this sector believe that it is enough to simply incentivize the establishment and expansion of decentralized infrastructure. But this approach is not sufficient to solve telcos’ and their customers’ real problems with connectivity.  As a long-term solution, DePINs should not only incentivize infrastructure development but also guarantee that they are deployed in locations with genuine demand for connectivity. Simultaneously, incentives should be created to ensure enterprise-grade signal quality and network stability.  Despite all the challenges, I believe DePIN is the killer use case for enterprises adopting blockchain, and it has the potential to become the next trillion-dollar industry. After the mass adoption of DePIN, distributed ledger technology will have a transformative effect on the telecommunications sector, similar to the launch of the internet. In the end, it will lead to efficient infrastructure deployment and maintenance with automatic settlements and billing among all parties, fostering decentralization, independence, and seamless collaboration between multiple stakeholders.

42407546,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQLU9,1727277564,Ethereum's Changing Landscape,"Ethereum’s ability to host a wide-range of applications and assets has been evident for years, but the investment case for its native token, ETH, has become increasingly complex. In the wake of key protocol changes, particularly the hardforks activating EIP-1559 and EIP-4844, investors are asking how Ethereum’s adoption will translate into ETH’s long-term value.  While the platform has scaled, the relationship between its growth and ETH’s supply and demand — and thus its price — is no longer as straightforward as it once seemed.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The EIP-1559 revolution: linking utility to token value  When Ethereum implemented EIP-1559 in 2021, it introduced a burn mechanism where the overwhelming majority of transaction fees (base fees) would be permanently removed from circulation. This created a direct relationship between Ethereum usage and ETH’s supply. As users paid for transactions on the Ethereum network, the burn would act as a deflationary force, reducing ETH’s supply and putting upwards pressure on its price.  In 2023, our valuation model at CoinShares showed that under the right conditions, where Ethereum generated $10 billion annually in L1 transaction fees, something it achieved at its 2021 heights, ETH could reach a value near $8,000 by 2028.  Since then, however, optimism has waned due to the Dencun hardfork and the rise of Layer-2s (L2), which have upended the fee burn and altered ETH’s value potential.  The rise of layer-2s: a double-edged sword  L2 platforms were designed to scale Ethereum by moving transactions off the main chain (L1) and onto faster, cheaper networks. Initially, L2s complemented L1, helping the network handle more transactions without clogging the base chain — like a pressure release valve giving balance in times of high usage.  But with the introduction of “blob space” in 2024, L2s could now settle transactions on L1 at much lower costs, reducing their requirement to pay expensive L1 fees. As more activity migrated to L2s, the supply burn that EIP-1559 was designed to instill began to drop, weakening the downward pressure on ETH’s supply.  The reality of Ethereum generating high L1 fees to support ETH’s value is now looking bleak. L1 transaction fees have steadily collapsed, leading to questions about what differentiates the services offered at each layer, and what will drive the L1 fee landscape moving forward.  A path forward: restoring the burn or adapting to new realities  Despite these challenges, there are potential paths forward to restore demand for L1 transactions and, in turn, ETH valuation.  One option is developing high-value use cases that rely on L1’s security and reliability, yet, given current trends, this appears unlikely in the near future. Another possibility is that L2 adoption grows so rapidly that the sheer volume of transactions compensates for the discounted fees — but this would require extraordinary L2 growth, beyond near-term expectations.  The most likely, and perhaps the most controversial, solution is repricing blob space to increase L2 settlement fees. While this would restore some of the L1 supply burn, it risks upsetting the economics of L2s that have been key to Ethereum’s recent success and enhanced its ability to compete as an ecosystem with alternative platforms (like Solana, Binance Chain, etc.).  The uncertain future of ETH  While L2s have scaled Ethereum, they have also disoriented the mechanisms that tie ETH’s value to its utility. For investors, this means that ETH’s future depends on how Ethereum balances innovation with maintaining healthy economic policy.  For now, ETH’s investment case is unsettling, and risks remain high as the Ethereum community decides its path forward.

The Fed has also telegraphed additional cuts via its latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) (aka “dot plot”).  Nonetheless, despite this more-than-expected interest rate reduction of 50 bps, it is quite likely that the Fed still remains “behind the curve.”  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  For instance, a standard Taylor rule based on the unemployment rate and core PCE inflation implies that a fed funds target rate of around 3.6% p.a. is already warranted based on the underlying economic and inflationary momentum.  In addition, the latest fund manager survey by Bank of America indicates that monetary policy was still “too restrictive” in September 2024 – in fact, the most restrictive since October 2008 according to this survey.  There still remains an increased risk of a recession as several reliable indicators such as the prominent “Sahm rule” remain triggered.  That being said, our quantitative analyses imply that global growth has become less relevant for the performance of bitcoin while other factors like monetary policy or the US dollar have become more important.  In other words, a US recession might not be as negative as widely anticipated for bitcoin and other cryptoassets. To the contrary, it may lead to even more Fed rate cut expectations and US Dollar weakness which could provide even more tailwind.  With the latest move by the Fed and other major central banks, the global liquidity tide is clearly turning; global money supply has already reached new all-time highs and is accelerating. Expansionary money supply growth periods are usually associated with bitcoin bull runs.  The re-steepening of the US yield curve which tends to be a recessionary indicator is also an indicator for increasing liquidity and therefore bullish for scarce assets like bitcoin.  What is more is that the increase in global liquidity is coinciding with the increasing supply scarcity of bitcoin which has been intensifying since the latest halving in April 2024.  Our analyses have shown that there tends to be a significant lag between the halving event itself and the moment the supply shock starts to become significant, as the supply deficit only tends to accumulate gradually over time.  So, it appears as if there is a perfect confluence between an increase in potential demand via global money supply and a simultaneous reduction in available supply via the halving.  The market has been mired in “chopsolidation” – a choppy consolidating range-bound market – since the latest all-time high in March 2024. This was due to several factors such as government sales of bitcoin, Mt. Gox trustee’s distribution of bitcoins, or the macro capitulation in early August 2024.  In this context, the summer months have generally been one of the worst performing months for bitcoin historically with September being the worst month of the year.  However, Q4 tends to be the best month for bitcoin from a pure performance seasonality perspective and we also expect bitcoin to break out of this chopsolidation in Q4.  It seems as if the wait for a new break-out to the upside is finally over. The Fed pivot may have just delivered the perfect catalyst for that.

One of the first financial institutions to use the platform will be Spanish bank BBVA, who expects to launch a live pilot in 2025.  Payments giant Visa (V) has developed a new product to help banks issue fiat-backed tokens on the Ethereum network.  Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) will enable the development of fiat-backed tokens powered by smart contracts to help digitize and automate existing processes that will then power the exchange of real-world assets (RWAs), according to an announcement seen by CoinDesk.  A bank would use Visa's new platform to purchase tokenized RWAs such as commodities or bonds with near-real-time settlement, using a token, the statement said. One of the first financial institutions to use VTAP will be Spanish bank BBVA, who expects to rollout a live pilot in 2025.  Visa's work in blockchain and digital assets is well established, with the company processing cryptocurrency payments in stablecoin USDC on Ethereum in March 2021.  Earlier this month, Visa became a partner of Brazil's central bank in its pilot project toward a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  The news was first reported by Blockworks.

33973035,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644448,1727274640,"Chainlink Sees 296% Jump In Large Transactions As Active Addresses Rise 14.7%, What’s Going On?","Chainlink whales are once again on the move in what seems to be a general reawakening. Large transactions on the blockchain network have ballooned recently, alongside a drastic increase in active addresses, hinting at a notable development. Therefore, in this report, we take a look at the significant increase in whale transactions and active addresses, as well as what could have triggered this burst of interest on the previously muted blockchain. Chainlink Whale Volumes Rises 295.93% According to data from the IntoTheBlock website, Chainlink whales are getting active again after a previous drop in activity. This time around, whale transactions consisting of LINK tokens with values of at least $100,000 and above, have seen a notable increase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Prediction: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why $100,000 Is The Nominal Price Level For 2025 On September 22, the number of large Chainlink transactions recorded was only 65, but by September 23, this number had risen to 130. This translates to a 100% increase in the number of transactions. In the same vein, the amount of tokens transacted also surged, but to a larger degree. Data shows that only 1.86 million LINK tokens were moved by Chainlink whales on September 22. However, this figure rose to 7.28 million tokens by September 23. In dollar terms, Chainlink whales moved $20.71 million on September 22 and $82.01 million on September 23. The total growth during this time came out to 295.93%. Daily active addresses also saw a significant increase on the network, although to a lesser degree compared to the whale volumes. Active addresses rose from 1,810 addresses to 2,070 addresses, representing a 14.72% increase. This rise in active addressees, coupled with the increase in whale transactions, suggests that attention is, once again, turning to the Chainlink network. What’s Driving The Recovery? So far, one notable development seems to be the driving force behind the Chainlink recovery and it has to do with the 21.co Bitcoin wrapper. The company announced that it was adopting the Chainlink Proof of Reserves mechanism for its 21BTC token, which is a wrapped version of Bitcoin that was made available on the Solana blockchain in May 2024. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Symmetrical Triangle Pattern Reappears, Why A 200% Rally Is Possible This move was to enable the company ensure completely transparency with 21BTC, while also tapping into the decentralization, programmability, and investor confidence that already exists in the Chainlink Proof of Reserves program. This will span across the 21BTC offering on both the Solana and Ethereum blockchains. As expected, the news was well-received by the community, triggering more active participation from investors. However, it has not had much of an impact on the LINK price, which continues to tread around the $11 level. The altcoin’s is seeing around 5% gains in the last week, meaning only small gains were recorded as a result of the announcement.

42407545,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQLXS,1727270264,Retail Accumulation and Exchange Outflows Drive Market Optimism for Bitcoin,"Retail bitcoin investors, particularly ""crabs"" and ""shrimps,"" have accumulated 35,000 BTC in the past 30 days, highlighting increased confidence and participation from smaller holders.  With 40,000 BTC withdrawn from exchanges in the past 30 days, reduced liquidity suggests a potential supply squeeze, creating a bullish environment for future bitcoin price increases.  In the past 30 days, the Bitcoin {{BTC}} ecosystem has seen a significant rally in accumulation, with approximately 88,000 BTC being amassed on a net basis. This strong period of accumulation, which has persisted through much of September, is notable for being about seven times the monthly bitcoin issuance of around 13,500 BTC. Such intense accumulation has not been seen since Q4 2023, a period that saw a rapid increase in bitcoin's price.  A deeper analysis of this net accumulation reveals that retail investors, particularly smaller holders, are playing a significant role. Investors with less than 10 BTC, often categorized as “crabs” (owning 1 to 10 BTC) and “shrimps” (owning less than 1 BTC), have collectively accumulated 35,000 BTC in the past 30 days. This trend of retail accumulation has been ongoing since May, underscoring the growing confidence and participation of smaller investors in the market.  Another factor providing a tailwind for bitcoin's price is the substantial outflow of bitcoin from exchanges. Around 40,000 BTC have left exchanges in the past 30 days, signaling reduced liquidity. When bitcoin is withdrawn from exchanges, it can indicate that holders intend to keep it off the market, reducing selling pressure and creating a bullish environment for future price increases as 74% of the circulating supply is considered illiquid.  This combination of retail accumulation and exchange outflows suggests that bitcoin's current momentum could continue to strengthen in the coming months.

33970809,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644139,1727269239,Ethereum Gains On Bitcoin Following Fed Rate Cut: Altseason Soon?,"Ethereum (ETH) price has outshined Bitcoin (BTC) over the last week since the US Federal Reserve (Fed) slashed interest rate by 50 basis points (bps) on September 18, 2024. Ethereum Gains On Bitcoin, Prelude To Altseason? Ethereum has had an impressive last few days as far as its price action is concerned. ETH has surged by 16% to $2,666 since the Fed cut rates for the first time in four years. BTC has risen by 9% in the same period, trading at $63,643 at press time. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Comeback Following Interest Rate Cut: Steno Research The ETH/BTC trading pair has surged from 0.0385 on September 18, to 0.0420 on September 23, indicating an increase of almost 9%. Notably, the ETH/BTC trading pair is a crucial trading pair observed by crypto analysts to gauge market sentiments toward altcoins relative to BTC. When ETH and other altcoins gain value against BTC, it suggests increased investor interest in altcoins, potentially signaling the beginning of an “altseason.” Conversely, when BTC outperforms ETH, it may indicate a shift back to Bitcoin dominance. It’s worth highlighting that the Ethereum futures funding rate has turned positive since the interest rate cut, standing at 0.0058% according to data from cryptocurrency futures trading and information platform CoinGlass. For the uninitiated, a positive funding rate implies that traders holding long positions – in this case, long ETH – are paying short positions, reflecting bullish market sentiments. The change in funding rate suggests greater optimism regarding ETH’s future price, likely driven by increased demand and confidence following the rate cut. That said, investors should be cautious of sharp movements in funding rates, as this could lead to market corrections amidst excessive optimism or due to any changes in external factors. Ethereum Faces Stiff Competition From Other Blockchains Throughout 2024, Ethereum has faced criticism for its lackluster performance relative to its competitors. Even major developments, like the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) failed to propel the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap significantly. In contrast, competing smart contract platforms like Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and Tron (TRX) have made impressive strides not only in terms of price appreciation but also regarding the development of ecosystem infrastructure. Related Reading: Tron-Based SUN Token Skyrockets 197% As SunPump’s Momentum Continues For instance, the Solana ecosystem witnessed many developments at Singapore’s recently concluded Solana Breakpoint 2024 event. Among other announcements, Franklin Templeton unveiled its plans to launch a mutual fund on Solana. Similarly, all eyes are on the release of former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao from prison on September 29, 2024. Crypto analysts predict that Zhao’s release could spark bullish momentum for Binance’s native token BNB, which has shown incredible resilience despite the exchange’s former CEO being imprisoned on money laundering charges. With the rising adoption of Ethereum layer-2 solutions offering high scalability with minimal transaction costs, expect the smart contract space to become increasingly competitive. ETH trades at $2,660 at press time, up 3.3% in the last 24 hours.

Additional node sales after that could increase total raised to $37 million.  Huddle01's ""dRTC Chain"" is built using the Ethereum layer-2 project Arbitrum's Orbit software stack, with a test network scheduled to launch two weeks after the node sale concludes.  Huddle01, a blockchain project to provide decentralized audio and video conferencing – aiming to provide lower latency virtual meetings than Zoom and Google Meet – plans to raise as much as $37 million in a sale of network nodes.  The 49,600 ""media nodes"" being sold offer operators a way to contribute excess internet bandwidth the communication network, in exchange for token rewards. According to a litepaper, some 21% of the project's HUDL tokens will be distributed to media nodes. Huddle01 is built using technology borrowed from the Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum.  The first sale of up 20,000 nodes, which would cost a total of $8 million, is set to begin in early November, with a whitelist sale starting on Nov. 6 and a public sale on Nov. 8, according to a press release shared exclusively with CoinDesk. If those are sold out, subsequent nodes could be sold to reach as much as $37 million.  A test network will launch two weeks after the sale completes, according to the press release.  “These nodes will power a network that already outperforms the incumbent Web2 competitors on latency where there is a large cluster of nodes, and is capable of improving lags across the globe,” Huddle01 CEO Ayush Ranjan said in the release.  Huddle01 becomes the latest in a growing trend of blockchain projects conducting node sales as a way to raise funds while simultaneously decentralizing their networks. Earlier this year, Aethir, a decentralized GPU cloud infrastructure provider, raised about $126 million in ether (ETH) by distributing node licenses, and since then projects including Sophon, CARV, XAI Games, Powerloom and more recently Sonic SVM have pursued the method to bring in fresh funds.  Built on Arbitrum Orbit  Huddle01, which previously had raised about $6 million in traditional fundraisings from investors including Hivemind, Balaji Srinivasan, Stani Kulechov, Dan Romero and Juan Benet, describes itself in the litepaper as ""a fully decentralized, self-sovereign, borderless and open network that will provide the necessary framework for performant, cost-effective and censorship-resistant real-time connectivity.""  The project's ""dRTC Chain"" is a new Ethereum-compatible blockchain network built using technology from the layer-2 project Arbitrum's Orbit software stack.  Purported benefits of the decentralized setup include avoidance of the ""oligarchic practices"" of ""large corporations that exert unilateral price and supply dominance,"" as well as reduced costs and latency resulting from the ""geographic disparity of data centers.""  According to the team, Huddle01 boasts a latency of 13 milliseconds in New York City, compared to Google Meet’s 141 milliseconds, and Zoom’s 20 milliseconds.

42407548,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQLe4,1727266242,U.S. M2 Money Supply Approaches New Highs as Financial Assets Reach Record Levels,"In August alone, the M2 money supply rose nearly 1%, and the Fed since has trimmed interest rates 50 basis points, with what looks like another 50 basis point rate cut coming in November.  Aggressive monetary easing by China and the U.S. Federal Reserve has driven asset price increases, with cryptocurrencies leading the charge since the recent FOMC meeting.  The growth of the M2 money supply, with a CAGR of 7% in the past five years, has been closely linked to the performance of the S&P 500 and other assets, underscoring the critical role of liquidity in driving market performance.  On Sept. 24, financial assets soared to record levels, among them the S&P 500, which reached a record high of 5,735 and gold, which climbed to $2,670 an ounce. The yellow metal, in fact, is now higher by 30% year-to-date, making 2024 the best-performing year for gold this century, according to Zerohedge.  But what is driving these continual rallies in financial markets? A closer look reveals that liquidity and money supply are key factors.  Central bank policies have significantly contributed to injecting liquidity into the global economy. As of Sept. 25, the combined balance sheets of the top 15 central banks worldwide exceeded $31 trillion, a level last seen in April 2024. This figure has been on the rise since July, reflecting a substantial monetary stimulus primarily in response to economic challenges and uncertainties, which has been crucial in supporting financial markets.  China's commitment to substantial monetary easing, combined with the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive 50 basis point rate cut, has further fueled market momentum, making cryptocurrencies the best-performing asset since the FOMC meeting on Sept. 18. The CME FedWatch Tool now predicts a 60% chance of another 50 basis point cut at the Nov. 7 meeting, which would lower the fed funds rate range to 4.25-4.50%.  Another key indicator of liquidity is the M2 money supply, which includes physical currency in circulation, savings and time deposits, and money market mutual funds. According to Trading Economics data, M2 money supply has shown consistent month-on-month growth, a trend that began in February 2024. In August alone, the M2 money supply increased by nearly 1% month-on-month, highlighting the ongoing monetary expansion. This rise in the money supply has been crucial in supporting asset prices.  Historically, there has been a strong correlation between the S&P 500 and the M2 money supply, with both moving in tandem over the past five years. For example, during the early 2020 pandemic, M2 bottomed out at $15.2 trillion in February, just before the S&P 500 hit a low of around 2,409 points in March. A similar pattern occurred in October 2023, when monetary policy tightening led M2 to bottom at $21 trillion. Shortly afterward, the S&P 500 reached a low of 4,117. This connection highlights the critical role of liquidity in driving stock market performance.  The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the M2 money supply has been 7%, while the S&P 500 has achieved a CAGR of 14% over the past five years. Although this represents strong performance, it is overshadowed by bitcoin's {{BTC}} impressive CAGR of 50% during the same period. Despite its volatility, bitcoin's higher growth rate reflects its increasing prominence as an asset class, often benefiting from the same liquidity dynamics that drive traditional markets.  Central banks' expansionary policies combined with a rising money supply are fueling asset price appreciation across the board. Whether it’s gold, the S&P 500, or bitcoin, the correlation with monetary measures like M2 highlights how liquidity remains a key driver of asset performance in today’s economy. As long as central banks continue to provide support, financial markets may well continue to push higher, though the sustainability of this trend remains a question for the future.

42407538,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQLAJ,1727265405,WazirX Hacker Is Almost Done Laundering $230M Stolen Funds,"The hacker behind July's $230 million WazirX hack has nearly finished laundering the stolen funds, using Tornado Cash to obscure the transactions.  Just $6 million worth of ether is left.  WazirX has been restructuring following the hack, which compromised over 45% of its reserves, and is facing challenges in fund recovery and criticism for its crisis management.  Whoever was behind India’s biggest cryptocurrency hack is almost done laundering over $230 million worth of tokens, on-chain data shows.  A wallet holding funds stolen from WazirX, formerly one of the country’s largest exchanges by trading volume, in July, is down to only $6 million worth of ether {{ETH}}. Blockchain data from Arkham show the funds are usually moved to new wallets before being sent to privacy service Tornado Cash.  The hacker moved just over $50 million worth of tokens to Tornado in August and stepped up activity in September, as the chart below shows. The latest movement was a 3,792 ETH ($10 million) transfer to a wallet early on Wednesday.  Tornado Cash allows crypto users to exchange tokens while masking wallet addresses on various blockchains. The service, by itself, is not nefarious but is commonly used by criminals to clean an online trail that could lead to the identity of those moving stolen funds. Alexey Pertsev, Tornado Cash developer, was found guilty of money laundering by a Dutch judge in May and sentenced to 64 months in prison.  In July, WazirX was hit by a security breach in one of its multisig wallets, causing over $100 million in shiba inu {{SHIB}} and $52 million in ether, among other assets, to be drained from the exchange.  The stolen funds accounted for over 45% of the total reserves cited by the exchange in a June 2024 report. The exchange has since filed for a restructuring process in Singapore to clear its liabilities.  WazirX, still reeling from the financial and reputational damage, has engaged in efforts to recover the funds with limited success. It has faced criticism for its handling of the crisis, especially concerning user communication and fund recovery processes.  Amidst this, Binance, which has had a contentious relationship with WazirX, clarified its lack of involvement in the security breach last week, emphasizing that it does not control or operate WazirX. That differs from what founder Nischal Shetty stated on X in August.",NEGATIVE,ETH | SHIB,ASIA | ETH | EXCHANGE | SHIB | ARKM,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/25/wazirx-hacker-is-almost-done-laundering-230m-stolen-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54e8ed67e5250d4d86c3802c9e51b325d9c11b8b-2000x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,029.51 +0.74%  Bitcoin (BTC): $63,558.29 +0.07%  Ether (ETH): $2,6421.07 -0.81%  S&P 500: 5,732.93 +0.25%  Gold: $2,656.06 -0.08%  Nikkei 225: 37,870.26 -0.19%  Top Stories  Bitcoin traded at around $63,600 during the European morning having retreated from a peak of $64,780 late on Tuesday. BTC is little changed in the last 24 hours, while the broader crypto market has risen just over 0.85%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. A week on from the Fed's first interest-rate cut in four years, traders are optimistic that the move will create a snowball effect with other central banks taking similar steps. “It’s becoming clear that the Fed has finally started its rate cut cycle, removing such concerns. This implies that we may see more from the People's Bank of China as the Fed continues to cut rates and the negative rate differential narrows,” Presto Research said in a note.  Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $136 million on Tuesday, the biggest in almost a month. More importantly, the inflows were equivalent to 2,132 BTC, according to data by HeyApollo, which represents nearly five times the daily mined supply being removed from the market. Ether ETFs recorded $62.5 million in total inflows, the third-largest day for ether ETF inflows since their launch. This rebound came just a day after Ether ETFs saw their largest outflows since July. Nevertheless, ether ETFs remain firmly in the red, having experienced net outflows of $624 million since they listed on July 23.  Assetera, an investment and trading firm for blockchain-based financial instruments, tapped Polygon to power its secondary market RWAs platform. The platform offers tokenized assets, such as securities, funds and money market instruments in a regulated digital trading venue. Assetera will use Ethereum scaling network Polygon to secure transactions and utilize stablecoins for purchase, clearing and settlement to ensure the process is fast and efficient. The Austria-regulated company holds both MiFID II and virtual asset service provider (VASP) licenses, and plans to upgrade to meet MiCA standards, which would open the door to offering its services across the European Union. The platform is open to both retail and professional clients.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the ratio between the U.S. Conference Board's leading and lagging economic indicators since 1958.  The ratio has tanked to a record low in a slide reminiscent of the previous eight meltdowns that portended recessions.

Its recent price action has fueled a bullish sentiment among investors and market watchers, who believe the token might be near a rally toward $1. Related Reading: BNB Falters At $600, Paving The Way For A Deeper Pullback Cardano Breaks Out To Reclaim Top 10 Spot Cardano’s price has steadily declined after the March highs, registering a 42% drop in the last six months. During the Q1 rally, the token hit its highest price since 2022, reaching the $0.774 price range. Since then, ADA has nosedived to pre-rally levels, disappointing some investors and market watchers. The crypto community has repeatedly slammed the project for a “lack of appeal” to the broader public. Additionally, many have criticized ADA’s “underwhelming” price action. However, the token’s recent rally has sparked a bullish sentiment among some community members. Despite the early September market shakeouts, the cryptocurrency has registered a 10% surge from its monthly opening, seeing green numbers in the weekly and biweekly timeframes. Technical analyst Crypto Yapper noted Cardano’s recent performance. The analyst highlighted that ADA displayed a multi-month descending broadening wedge structure on its chart with multiple touch points on the top side and on the lower side. Inside this structure, the cryptocurrency displayed a smaller falling wedge pattern with its upper trendline being tested again on Monday. The analyst stated that the $0.35 was the first crucial resistance level for the token. Claiming this key zone and breaking out of the falling wedge pattern could create more bullish action and move the price toward the upper line of the bigger bullish structure. On Monday, Cardano’s token reclaimed the $0.36 range, a level not seen in nearly a month. The surge sent ADA’s price toward the $0.37 resistance level, turning the $0.375 price range into a support zone on Tuesday morning. The recent performance also pushed Cardano back to the top ten cryptocurrencies list after ADA’s market capitalization surged 6%, surpassing Tron (TRX) in the last 24 hours. Analysts See New Price Targets For ADA Today, Crypto Yapper noted that ADA broke above resistance as the cryptocurrency was creating a higher high on the daily chart. This performance “indicates a huge trend reversal for Cardano.” However, he pointed out that to break above the descending broadening wedge, the token must reclaim its second key resistance level at $0.39. If successful, the breakout could target the structure’s higher price range of $0.52. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) On Track For ‘Strongest September Performance’, Is $90,000 Next? Other analysts also highlighted ADA’s performance and breakout, suggesting that the cryptocurrency has the potential for a 170% surge. Dan Gambardello pointed out, “Cardano just went through a phenomenal throwback to a colossal triangle pattern.” To the analyst, “If crypto is about to enter a green October, I anticipate ADA will reclaim $1 with haste.” ADA is trading at $0.378, a 6.2% and 12.2% surge in the daily and weekly timeframes.

The company is transitioning from a crypto trading platform to a full-fledged financial platform, with growing revenues from subscriptions and services. COIN stock is highly profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis, but Coinbase faces tough comps in the short term. The market for tokenized assets is likely to explode over time, but right now, Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) faces major headwinds. The stock has slumped since a booming start to 2024 and more headwinds from rate cuts aren’t likely to help the crypto exchange. My investment thesis is more Neutral on the stock for now before long-term growth trends kick into gear. Source: Finviz Tough Comps The crypto market saw volumes explode during Q1 of the year with bitcoin prices jumping back over $60K. The whole investment story in Coinbase is far more appealing as the company moves from a business just focused on crypto trading tied mostly to bitcoin to a full fledge financial with crypto transactions, ETFs, stable coins and non-bitcoin or Ethereum crypto trading. The opportunity now exists for revenues to move more towards subscription and services revenue like stablecoin and blockchain rewards. Coinbase still saw 1H results dictated by consumer transaction revenue with Q1 revenue of $935 million accounting for nearly 65% of total revenue. Source: Coinbase Q2'24 shareholder letter Revenues remains elevated in Q2, with bitcoin volumes remaining prices above $60K. Coinbase still produces 35% of trading volumes from bitcoin, but other crypto assets continue to grow market share with USDT trading now accounting for 10% of volumes, though not revenues with Solana jumping up to 10% of transaction revenues. Source: Coinbase Q2'24 shareholder letter As Coinbase discussed, the crypto company has shifted from only trading crypto for customers to a full-fledged financial platform. Base grew onchain crypto transactions by 300% QoQ, finally moving crypto to more than just an asset class. The lack of regulatory clarity is still holding back institutional investing in crypto. The company regularly discusses major banks only place 1% to 3% of institutional clients' assets in crypto, and the amount could jump to 10% to 20% on more clarity. Adjusted Profit Machine As with a lot of fintechs, Coinbase falls into the trap of GAAP profits versus adjusted EBITDA. The company is highly profitable on an adjusted basis due to a couple of large and volatile costs that detract from profits. Coinbase actually produced $1.0 billion in adjusted EBITDA in Q1 due to constrained costs that don't dramatically rise with transaction revenues. The big costs for the company are stock-based compensation and volatile gains or losses on crypto assets held for investment that don't impact operations. Source: Coinbase Q2'24 shareholder letter In a more normal Q2, Coinbase produced an adjusted EBITDA of $596 million. The company had $218 million in SBC and a $319 million loss on crypto assets held for investments. Coinbase actually reported operating income of $343 million in the quarter prior to the crypto losses. In addition, the company was hit with $84 million in interest expenses in the quarter that once removed boosted adjusted EBITDA. Investors would probably want to adjust tax expenses and these interest expenses or income as in prior quarters to derive a true adjusted profit. Either way, Coinbase is highly profitable, especially when crypto trading volumes are high. The company guided to relatively weak revenues in Q3 with subscription and services revenues flat to down at $530 to $600 million. The crypto markets limited volatility during Q3 and July transaction revenues of only $210 million, suggest trading volumes will be low. The consensus analyst estimates forecast revenues around $1.3 billion, but the biggest issue is whether Coinbase can grow revenues with lower trading volumes. The stock has a market cap of $42 billion with adjusted EBITDA running at a $2.4 billion clip based on Q2 results with consensus estimates up at $2.6 billion for 2025. Data by YCharts The stock is attractive at just 16x EBITDA targets. Coinbase has a lot of growth opportunities via international expansion, regulatory clarity bringing in institutions and expansion of investors and traders into crypto assets with the approval of ETFs and such. The biggest concern is that some current headwinds with lower interest rates and less volatile trading suggesting quarterly results will face headwinds in the short term. Investors should look for weakness to buy Coinbase for future growth. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that Coinbase has a lot of growth potential ahead as crypto assets move more mainstream. Investors should simply wait for a better price as the market resets to a lower revenue stream in the short term.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4723167-coinbase-wait-for-crypto-reset-to-finish?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33968329.jpeg

Crypto traders on South Korea-based exchanges seem to have shifted from bitcoin {{BTC}} to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) amid bullish analysts' forecasts in the wake of the recent U.S. interest-rate cut.  That's the message from analytics firm CryptoQuant's Bitcoin Korea premium index, which measures the price gap between Korean and offshore exchanges.  The index turned negative Wednesday, sliding to -0.55, reflecting the deepest discount since October 2023. In other words, bitcoin has fallen out of favor in Korea. Trading volumes over Korean exchanges suggest the same, indicating a shift toward high-beta alternative cryptocurrencies.

42407531,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQKnA,1727259144,A Fire Alarm Interrupted an Aussie Crypto Summit. The Symbolism Wasn't Missed by a Concerned Industry,"Australia's crypto industry is worried after the country's securities regulator signaled an expansion of its power.  ASIC said it considers many crypto assets as financial products, adding a regulatory burden that may spur companies to move elsewhere.  Australia's crypto industry is concerned companies may flee the country after the nation's securities regulator set off ""the crypto fire alarm,"" by saying it considers most crypto assets to be financial products in what some observers interpreted as an expansion of its powers, experts told CoinDesk on Wednesday.  Symbolically, a real fire alarm sounded – unnecessarily, it transpired – at a crypto summit hosted by the Australian Financial Review (AFR) shortly after the comment by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's (ASIC) Alan Kirkland.  He had told what the AFR called a hostile crowd at Monday's event that ASIC thinks ""many widely traded crypto assets are a financial product.” Many, therefore, are likely to need a license under current laws.  Kirkland's comments raised concerns the regulator is tightening its oversight and is likely to impose onerous conditions that could drive companies offshore.  ASIC is adopting ""a more stringent approach"" and businesses are ""feeling uncertain,"" which could drive them to explore opportunities abroad, Amy-Rose Goodey, the managing director of the Digital Economy Council of Australia told CoinDesk  The comments ""should prompt urgent industry consultation with policymakers"" said Michael Bacina, a partner at law firm Piper Alderman. ""If ASIC maintains their regulation by enforcement approach ... then ASIC will be taking a path the U.S. SEC took years ago. Having the courts set the regulatory perimeter is highly inefficient for both the regulator and the industry.“  ASIC has already resorted to court action against crypto companies, including one dismissed case against Finder Wallet.  That company's founder, Fred Schebesta, was on the stage straight after Kirkland's comments when the fire alarm went off, AFR reported. The irony was clear.  Schebesta told the audience that Kirkland's approach was like giving ""the Wright Brothers a fine because they didn’t have a pilot’s licence,"" according to AFR. He later told CoinDesk: ""The laws need to be updated to provide certainty"" as even ""the ongoing maintenance and compliance post-licensing can be quite burdensome.""

ASIC's approach highlights the gray area in the country's crypto regulation, with draft legislation that was announced in 2023 still not enacted.  ""There still remain many grey areas in regulation of crypto, especially with further delay to the introduction of the new regulation which is not expected until mid 2025 at the earliest,"" Cooper said in a WhatsApp message.

Recent financials show strong top-line results driven by increased interest in crypto and organic IRR, with services revenue growing 80% YoY. COIN's valuation has become attractive again, trading at 6.4x sales, making it a compelling buy after a recent dip. We're re-iterating our 'Buy' rating on COIN. Over the last 18 months or so, we've put out a number of bullish articles about Coinbase ( COIN ), the leading regulated crypto exchange in the United States. Here are some links to this research, if you'd like to have a gander: Coinbase: Diversifying Revenue, Cutting Costs, And Well Positioned For The Next Bull Market Coinbase: Very, Very, Very Promising Coinbase: All Signs Point To Further Gains (Technical Analysis) Since the very start of our coverage, we've maintained a 'Buy' rating on COIN, and from our first rating through today, investors have been treated to more than +190% in total returns, vs. a ~38.5% return for the S&P 500 in that same span: Seeking Alpha Talk about alpha! The core of our thesis has historically centered around our belief that the crypto exchange was successfully transitioning away from transaction -based model and towards a services -based model which would come with more stable revenues, solid new avenues for growth, and a higher multiple. As the company's revenue has diversified, swings in the underlying crypto market have proven easier to navigate, and the multiple has grown, mostly according to our expectations. Looking forward, our bullish thesis remains centered on two things - COIN's continued success with a services-based model, and the valuation, which has once again become attractive. We avoided talking about the stock for the last 8 months or so as a result of the company's extended valuation, but today, given the dip, COIN looks well priced vs. future expectations, and we're once again re-iterating our 'Buy' rating. In this article, we'll explore fundamental updates with COIN (since we last covered those), and explain why we're still bullish on the stock. Sound good? Let's dive in. COIN's Financials Since we last covered COIN on a fundamental basis, the company has reported earnings 3 times, in February , May , and August . Each of these reports saw strong generally results, although the Q2 report did miss on EPS by a little bit: Seeking Alpha These results - particularly the top line growth - were largely driven by a boost in underlying crypto sentiment, which caused a massive spike in transaction-based revenue. You can see this increase below, particularly in Q1 of this year, with transaction revenue surging more than 100% QoQ from Q4: IR This increase in revenue is linear to the degree that it can be plotted on a graph. Below, you can see how higher prices, and higher volumes at higher prices, especially at the start of 2024, drove big revenues for COIN: TradingView This chart is only of BTC, but similar charts exist for ETH, SOL, etc. Clearly, some of COIN's revenue is still directly correlated with crypto prices and market interest. However, these charts have come off a bit in terms of both price and volume, which is primarily why the stock has fallen 100 points from the $270 region to the $170 region over the last few months: TradingView This leads us to the growth in services. Dig into the table above, and you'll notice how much COIN's additional lines of business have increased and stabilized since we first highlighted them early last year. In Q2, from a YoY standpoint, stablecoin revenue has grown from $150 million to $240 million in pretty much a straight line. Similarly, blockchain rewards, subscription fees, interest, and custodian fees have also increased without much volatility, due to increasing platform utilization, as well as a mix of higher takes, models, and crypto prices. Together, COIN's services revenues have grown from $335 million per quarter (in Q2 2023) to ~$600 million per quarter (at present) . This represents YoY growth of roughly 80%. Again, some of this is due to higher crypto prices, but much of this increase is also driven by a stronger business focus and organic IRR within segments. To some extent, a bet on COIN will always be a bet on the future of crypto, but these quarterly service revenue figures from COIN are starting to pile up. Finally , if we're looking at COIN from a profitability standpoint, the company has done a decent job of controlling spend in the face of 80% YoY services and 100%+ transaction revenue growth: IR Sure, spend has increased roughly 41% after a brutal round of cuts in 2022, but we see this as reasonable re-investment into the company in order to grow the business further. Plus, on a cash basis, the company just reported two strong quarters of $400 million+ CFO, so it's not like COIN is hurting for bottom line profitability: Seeking Alpha Net income numbers are hampered somewhat by the more than $200 million per quarter in SBC, but given growth of COIN's services businesses, we're willing to overlook this as a negative for the time being. COIN's Valuation Our view on the fundamentals is well established at this point, and we're happy to see the company continue growing recurring revenues alongside the recent burst in transaction business. The barbell approach is working, and we think COIN is well positioned to grow into the definitive 'all in one' bridge to the crypto economy. However, the reason we're excited about the stock as of late is actually due to the valuation. The price you pay for good assets matters , and for the longest time this year, COIN's price was simply too expensive from a long-term allocation standpoint: TradingView The chart above is of COIN's Price / Sales ratio, which has been quite volatile since IPO in 2021. As you can see, COIN's sales multiple increased early in the year to around 16x sales (very high) as transaction revenue was exploding. However, as COIN has reported results, the stock has coincidentally come in somewhat. This has created a reasonable looking multiple for a long-term entry. In November 2023, we argued that COIN was a long based on the potential of the high-margin services businesses, alongside a 6x sales multiple . Since then, the stock is up 93%, but the stock is still trading at 6.4x sales . To us, given that COIN management have demonstrated - concretely , through results - that the combined transaction/services approach can produce more stable financials and better margin, we think that re-entering the stock at a similar multiple to a year ago appears to be a solid move. The capital appreciation COIN has experienced, in combination with the similar multiple, also does a good job of showing just how much the organic business has grown in a short span. Between the financials and the valuation, we think buying the recent dip in COIN's stock appears to be an appealing way to allocate capital in today's market. Risks There are, of course, risks to this thesis. First off , regulatory hurdles remain. The SEC has been famously uncooperative to the crypto space as a whole, but the recent Chevron supreme court ruling should help out the industry, as it allows government agencies less room for interpretation of the law. In theory, this should produce a more consistent regulatory regime for Crypto. Thus, while COIN is still on the backfoot vs. the U.S. government in terms of 'power', we're hopeful that things will improve in the coming years. Secondly , the crypto space remains volatile, and to some degree, all of COIN's revenues are tied to the success of the space. Management has done a good job of reducing the reliance on transactions to keep the business viable, which reduces the amplitude of earnings volatility somewhat, but if interest in crypto dies down, secularly, over the long term, then it's tough to see how COIN could appreciate from here. In fact, in that scenario, the company is likely in a LOT of trouble. Thankfully, we don't see that happening. Finally , there's always a risk that getting in at 6.4x sales is a bit expensive. The multiple has decreased to 1-2x in the worst bear markets in the past, and the same could happen in the future, even given COIN's improved profitability & stability profile. Summary That said, we're long-term bulls in COIN. Interest in crypto remains high, regulatory risks seem to be subsiding, and recent results show concrete proof that COIN's focus on services is powering results. 6.4x sales might be a bit expensive in the event that a crypto bear market is around the corner, but taken together, especially as the Fed begins cutting rates, we think that buying the recent dip in the stock is the best course of action. Thus, we're re-iterating our 'Buy' rating on COIN.

Bitcoin Long-Term Power Law Could Reveal Possible Location Of Next Top In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about what the Long-Term Power Law could say about the next potential Bitcoin top. The “Long-Term Power Law” here refers to a BTC price model created by Bitbo. The model involves three lines, the main one being the “power law,” which is derived by taking a linear regression of the historical BTC price. “This power law is just a straight line to represent the correlation between Bitcoin’s price and time,” notes Bitbo in the model’s description. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Is At A Critical Retest: Can Bulls Triumph? The other two lines of the model are just replicas of the power law, with the only difference being how they are arranged on the chart. One of these lines is placed under the power law just enough that BTC’s historical price either stays above it or touches it. This level of the model is called the support line. Similarly, the other line sets an upper boundary on the cryptocurrency’s price and is known as the resistance level. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Long-Term Power Law over the history of the asset: As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin’s spot price is currently being traded under the power law. The asset retested the line earlier in the year when it set its new all-time high (ATH) but couldn’t find a break. Despite the recent bearish action, though, BTC still has some distance over the support line of the model. The graph shows that Bitcoin set three of its major tops around the resistance line. However, the 2021 bull run top occurred before the asset could reach the level. Thus, it’s unknown whether or not the current BTC cycle will follow the lead of the earlier three. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Coming? These Two Signals Could Suggest So “If the Bitcoin Long-Term Power Law holds, the next market top might hit around $400,000!” notes Martinez, based on the fact that the resistance level would assume a value around that mark next year. As for when exactly BTC could hit its next cyclical top, the analyst has also discussed it in another X post, sharing the chart below for the asset’s performance during the last couple of cycles. “If this Bitcoin cycle follows the last two, we could see a market top in about a year, around October 2025!” says Martinez. BTC Price Bitcoin has been moving sideways over the last few days as its price still floats around the $63,200 mark.

Ether ETFs saw $62.5 million in inflows, led by BlackRock’s ETHA with $59.3 million, third-largest day for Ether ETF inflows since launch.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the U.S. are doing their bit to boost supply scarcity in the crypto market.  According to the latest data from Farside Investors, bitcoin {{btc}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw an inflow of $136.0 million on Sept. 24. Leading this surge was BlackRock's IBIT ETF, which experienced a significant inflow of $98.9 million, marking its largest inflow since Aug. 26. This brings IBIT's total net inflows to over $21 billion, reinforcing its number one position in the market. Other notable contributors included Fidelity's FBTC, with $16.8 million in net inflows, and Bitwise's BITB, which attracted $17.4 million.  More importantly, the inflows on Sept. 24 were equivalent to 2,132 BTC, with IBIT accounting for 1,548 BTC, per HeyApollo data. Given that the current daily issuance of Bitcoin is around 450 BTC, these inflows represent nearly five times the daily mined supply being removed from the market.

This rebound came just a day after Ether ETFs saw their largest outflows since July, underscoring the volatility inherent in the crypto markets.  Despite the intense inflow day, total outflows from ether ETFs stand at $624.4 million, reflecting the broader uncertainty investors face with ether compared to bitcoin.

This activity, as shown in data by the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, has led to analysts advising “extreme caution” in the face of this development. Related Reading: ‘Uptober’ Is Just Around The Corner: Here’s Where Bitcoin Price Is Headed Old Bitcoin On The Move: A Signal for Caution? A CryptoQuant analyst under the pseudonym XBTManager noted that Bitcoin’s upward trend has been accompanied by increased activity on the network, particularly from wallets that have held Bitcoin for extended periods. The question now is whether this movement will lead to a broader market reaction. Old Bitcoins are on the move “Overall, we are seeing a significant increase in the movement of coins from various age bands during this latest leg of the rise, with continuous transfers happening on the #Bitcoin network.” – By @XBTManager Full post 👇https://t.co/LR0bvdvAOY pic.twitter.com/sUe6yqp4Xj — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) September 24, 2024 XBTManager detailed these movements, noting several significant transfers of old Bitcoin in recent days. For example, on September 18, over 21,000 Bitcoin were moved from wallets that had held the cryptocurrency for periods ranging from one week to three years. Similar patterns were observed on the following days, with over 29,000 BTC, held for six to twelve months, being moved on September 23 alone. The analyst emphasized the importance of monitoring where these BTCs are headed—whether they are being transferred to exchanges, which could suggest an impending sell-off. The increased movement of old Bitcoin raises concerns about potential selling pressure in the market. As XBTManager pointed out, the large-scale transfer of Bitcoin from wallets that have held onto the asset for months or even years could slow down Bitcoin’s current upward momentum. “As more transfers occur on the network, Bitcoin’s upward momentum begins to slow down. Extreme caution is advised,” the analyst noted. Related Reading: Analyst Who Predicted The Bitcoin Rally Reveals Time To Sell Potential Selling Pressure on The Horizon? Another CryptoQuant analyst, BaroVirtual, has echoed the sentiment of caution. BaroVirtual highlighted a recent decline in institutional short positions, which may not necessarily be a positive signal for the market. According to the analyst, while the reduction of short positions might offer some short-term relief, the analyst expressed concern over the long-term implications, noting: I don’t quite agree that this is a positive signal if institutional investors are no longer aggressively shorting Bitcoin. Perhaps this is good for the short term so the market can take a breath. However, the build-up of short positions is needed in the long term to fuel Bitcoin’s growth.

42407544,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZQLQq,1727247930,"Bitcoin's $5.8B Quarterly Options Expiry May Spark Market Swings, Deribit Says","A notable amount of bitcoin and ether open interest is set to expire ""in-the-money"" on Friday, setting stage for price swings, Deribit's Luuk Strijers said.  Options beyond the Friday expiry exhibit a bullish bias for bitcoin and ether.  BTC's max pain level of $59,000 may weigh over prices, analyst at Presto Research said.  The bitcoin {{BTC}} market may get busy in the next two days as options contracts worth several billion dollars are due to expire Friday at 08:00 UTC, cryptocurrency exchange Deribit told CoinDesk in a message Wednesday.  As of writing, 90,000 BTC options contracts worth $5.8 billion were due for settlement alongside $1.9 billion in ether options. One Deribit one options contract represents one BTC or one ETH. Deribit is the world's leading cryptocurrency options exchange, accounting for over 85% of the global activity.  Of the total bitcoin open interest of $5.8 billion, about 20% was ""in-the-money"" or having favorable strike prices compared to the cryptocurrency's going market rate. A similar positioning is seen in ether options. For call options, being in-the-money means having a strike price lower than the going market rate, while it's the other way around for ITM puts. Both allow holders to exercise their right to buy or sell profitably, setting the stage for market volatility.  ""Of the BTC options expiring, about 20% is in the money. This larger expiry is likely to heighten market volatility or activity as traders close or roll over their positions, which could also impact prices,"" Luuk Strijers, chief executive officer at Deribit, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Rollover of positions means closing existing traders in the upcoming expiry and opening new ones in the subsequent expiries to extend the holding period. Profit-making positions are often rolled over as seasoned traders prefer to let winners run.  What next?  Activity is likely to remain robust in months ahead, as the U.S. SEC's decision to green light options tied to BlackRock's bitcoin ETF (IBIT) could accelerate institutional adoption.  ""One of the largest potential drivers is the options on ETFs. The SEC has given its blessing, but OCC and CFTC have yet to approve it and are not likely to do so this week,"" Strijers said.  The way options expiring in the coming months are priced suggests a bullish outlook.  ""BTC and ETH put-call skew is negative after September expiry, which is a bullish indicator as calls are relatively more expensive than puts,"" Strijers noted.  A call option provides buyer an asymmetric bullish exposure, protecting from price rallies while a put options provide insurance against market swoons.  The bullish bias in the options market is consistent with the consensus that the Fed's renewed rate-cut cycle and similar moves from other central banks, including the People's Bank of China, will underpin demand for bitcoin and ether. According to analysts at Birtfinex, the rally could gather pace once bitcoin tops the $65,200 level.  Max pain effect  The max pain is the price level at which option buyers suffer the most loss on expiry. A popular theory in traditional markets often cites the max pain level as a magnet while heading into the expiry. That's because option sellers, usually large institutions with ample capital supply, trade the underlying asset to influence the spot price around the maximum pain point to inflict maximum loss on buyers.  Bitcoin's max pain level for Friday's expiry is $59,000.""The current max pain point of $59,000, approximately 8% below the spot price, does create some potential downward pressure as we approach expiry,"" Rick Maeda, an analyst at Presto Research, told CoinDesk.  The max pain theory has been doing the rounds since 2021, although some believe the crypto options market is still relatively small to have a meaningful impact on the spot price.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/25/bitcoins-58b-quarterly-options-expiry-may-spark-market-swings-deribit-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f16e678be8aeaefe17bf9e18202e0dde71b69762-1280x640.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Polymarket traders are giving a 50% chance that the Fed makes another 50 bps cut.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} showed signs of strength Wednesday as it retook the $64,000 level in early Asian hours, but later retreated, to reverse drawdowns from a day before, with alternative token Sui {{SUI}} leading gains in the broader market.  BTC added 1% in the past 24 hours, data from CoinDesk Indices shows, while Solana’s {{SOL}} jumped 3% to lead gains among major tokens. Ether {{ETH}} was flat on the day amid signs of a fallout with institutional investors, while BNB Chain’s {{BNB}} showed signs of reversals after a 10% rally in the past seven days.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, a measure of the price performance of the largest tokens by market capitalization, was up 2.4%.  Outside of majors, memecoins and layer-1 token bets have led gains in the crypto market on continual demand and positive sentiment among traders. Sui Network’s {{SUI}} jumped 16% in the past 24 hours to extend weekly gains to nearly 50%, while dog-themed memecoins jumped over 5% on average.  Floki’s FLOKI tokens zoomed 16% over the past week as its speedy and cheap trading bot crossed $75 million in volumes and crossed $1 million in net fees - with part of that amount now put aside to buy and burn FLOKI from the open market.  Developers also said late Tuesday that Floki’s metaverse game Valhalla had signed a multi-year partnership with esports organization Alliance to boost users and visibility ahead of its release in November.  Looking Ahead  Bitcoin traders have received a boost in the past week as countries from the U.S. to China are easing monetary policy to combat a slowdown in thier economies - setting the bedrock for what can be a rush to riskier bets in the coming months.  Expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate by another 50 basis points at its November meeting is currently at 50% on Polymarket, while the possibility of a 25 bps cut is at 44%.  Some traders say the Fed’s move ultimately influences other authorities to take similar steps, leading to a snowball effect.  “The timing of the announcement suggests that the Fed’s policy played a key role in the PBoC’s decision,” Presto Research analysts said in a Wednesday note shared with CoinDesk. “There’s been chatter that what’s holding the PBoC back from being more aggressive in providing monetary stimulus is the risk of it losing efficacy due to capital flight, as CNY’s short-term rate has been below that of the USD since mid-2022.”  “It’s becoming clear that the Fed has finally started its rate cut cycle, removing such concerns.

The price is now trading above $0.590 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5865 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5950 and $0.6050 resistance levels. XRP Price Eyes Upside Break XRP price remained stable above the $0.5780 level and started a decent upward move like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price was able to climb above the $0.5850 and $0.5880 resistance levels. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5865 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair climbed above $0.5920 and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6123 swing high to the $0.5784 low. The price is now trading above $0.590 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5950 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.600 level. The next key resistance could be $0.6050 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.6123 swing high to the $0.5784 low. A clear move above the $0.6050 resistance might send the price toward the $0.6120 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6250 resistance or even $0.6320 in the near term. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5950 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5865 level. The next major support is near the $0.5785 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5785 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5665 support in the near term. The next major support sits at $0.5500. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5865 and $0.5785.

Victims were lured into online betting and gaming, promising easy earnings before trapping their funds.  Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes, has helped India's Enforcement Directorate (ED), the authority investigating financial crimes, arrest four individuals in a gaming scam worth $47.6 million.  Binance ""provided critical intelligence that was instrumental in tracing the funds and uncovering the fraud network,"" an announcement said. ""ED's investigation uncovered links to digital wallets together with deep cooperation from Binance's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).""  The fraud is related to the Fiewin gaming app in which victims were lured into online betting and gaming, promising easy earnings before trapping their funds.  The ED and Binance did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk question about whether the $47.6 million was recovered.  ""Public-private collaborations are crucial in tackling complex financial crimes,"" an unnamed representative from the ED cited by Binance said. ""In this case, they (Binance) provided us with analytical support that contributed to the investigation.""

According to a CryptoQuant analyst under the pseudonym Darkfost, this metric has recently dipped into the “green zone,” a signal historically associated with upward price movements for Bitcoin. The analyst shared these insights earlier today on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Short Squeeze as Bitcoin Futures Market Heats Up Detailing The Green Zone And Its Implication For Bitcoin’s Price The Puell Multiple measures the relationship between Bitcoin miners’ short-term revenue and average earnings over the past year. By comparing these figures, the metric offers a glimpse into the overall profitability of miners and its potential impact on the broader market. Miners, as key participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem, influence market supply, and their decision to either hold or sell mined Bitcoin can trigger significant price movements. The Puell Multiple is divided into two primary zones that provide crucial market insights: the “red zone” and the “green zone.” The red zone, characterized by a value above 4, according to the CryptoQuant analyst, indicates that miners are generating substantial profits. When miners are highly profitable, they are more likely to sell their Bitcoin holdings, which can lead to increased market supply and downward pressure on the price. Historically, reaching the red zone has often preceded a market correction. On the other hand, the green zone, defined as values below 0.5, indicates that miners are operating with very low profitability or even at a loss. When miners struggle to break even, they may reduce their operations or shut down their mining rigs altogether. This can decrease selling pressure in the market, often creating conditions for a bullish reversal. According to Darkfost, the Puell Multiple recently hit 0.5, signaling that miners are currently in the green zone—a strong indicator that the market could be poised for an upward shift. Bitcoin Current Market Performance And Outlook While an upward momentum may be certain for BTC, given the current trend in its Puell Multiple metrics, the asset’s performance over the past few days has been quite appealing. Particularly, following the US announced decision on the Fed rate cut last Thursday, Bitcoin has seen a consistent increase in price day after day, which has now brought its uptick in the last week to nearly 10%. Currently, the asset trades for $62,830. This trading price comes against the backdrop of Bitcoin seeing a slight dip of 0.4% over the past day.

33961102,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24202,1727243188,Bitfinex Alpha 123 | BTC Dự Kiến Tích Lũy Sau Khi Cắt Giảm Lãi Suất,"Tải Full Alpha Bitcoin vừa có màn “lội ngược dòng” ngoạn mục khi Fed quyết định cắt giảm lãi suất , tăng hơn 22% và “chạm nóc” mới tại 64.200 đô vào ngày 20/9. Tuy nhiên, BTC vẫn “ngậm ngùi” chưa vượt qua đỉnh “cứng đầu” 65.200 đô từ ngày 25/8. Nếu không bứt phá được, điều này xác nhận xu hướng giảm của Bitcoin từ tháng 3 đến nay, khi mỗi đỉnh mới đều lép vế hơn đỉnh trước đó. Ngoài ra, dù giá tăng gần đây, nhưng đáng lo ngại là mức độ quan tâm mở đối với BTC đã vượt mặt mức tăng giá của chính nó, cho thấy thị trường tương lai và thị trường vĩnh cửu, chứ không phải thị trường giao ngay, mới là “ngòi nổ” chính đằng sau phần lớn biến động trong tuần trước. Trong khi đó, một số altcoin “lên như diều gặp gió”, một số token nổi bật tăng hơn 100% so với mức thấp trong tháng 8 và 9. Tuy nhiên, cần thận trọng vì mức độ quan tâm mở đối với altcoin cũng đạt mức cao mới mà không có sự đột phá giá tương ứng trên thị trường altcoin nói chung. Chỉ số OTHERS (đo lường hiệu suất của các altcoin không bao gồm 10 đồng tiền hàng đầu) tiếp tục giảm trong tháng trước. Với việc mua trên thị trường giao ngay Bitcoin chậm lại, bằng chứng là Khối lượng Tích lũy Giao ngay đi ngang khi giá đạt 63.500 đô, chúng tôi dự đoán BTC sẽ di chuyển trong một phạm vi trong ngắn hạn. Tuy nhiên, một lập luận phản bác là dòng vốn ETF duy trì có thể hỗ trợ giá BTC. Tuần trước, các quỹ ETF Bitcoin giao ngay đã ghi nhận thêm 397,2 triệu đô. Điều này cho thấy khả năng tăng giá hơn nữa, đặc biệt nếu các thị trường tài chính truyền thống như S&P 500 tiếp tục tăng. Nếu Bitcoin vượt qua các mức kháng cự quan trọng từ cuối tháng 8, nó có thể đạt mức cao mới. Tuy nhiên, nếu không có sự mua vào giao ngay bền vững, việc đi ngang hoặc điều chỉnh một phần dường như là kịch bản có khả năng xảy ra nhất. Trong nền kinh tế rộng lớn hơn, quyết định cắt giảm lãi suất 50 điểm cơ bản của Fed được coi là lần cắt giảm đầu tiên trong một loạt các đợt giảm và phản ánh sự thay đổi trong các ưu tiên của ngân hàng trung ương từ kiểm soát lạm phát sang tập trung vào thị trường lao động. Lạm phát đang có dấu hiệu hạ nhiệt, thể hiện qua dữ liệu doanh số bán lẻ tháng 8 chỉ tăng 0,1%. Khi việc làm ổn định và tăng trưởng, chi tiêu hộ gia đình dự kiến sẽ theo sau, nhưng vẫn còn những điều không chắc chắn. Sản xuất công nghiệp đã hồi sinh mạnh mẽ vào tháng 8, và thị trường nhà ở cũng có sự “ấm lên” trong xây dựng nhà ở một gia đình. Tuy nhiên, vẫn chưa rõ liệu đà này có được duy trì hay không. Các hành động của Fed sẽ rất quan trọng. Bối cảnh tiền điện tử tiếp tục phát triển “nhanh như chớp”, được đánh dấu bằng các động thái thể chế quan trọng và các cuộc đàn áp quy định. Trong một bước tiến lớn để Bitcoin hội nhập vào tài chính truyền thống, SEC đã “bật đèn xanh” cho BlackRock niêm yết các quyền chọn cho iShares Bitcoin Trust của mình, và các nhà phát hành ETF khác cũng đã xếp hàng nộp đơn. Trong khi đó, MicroStrategy đã mở rộng số lượng Bitcoin nắm giữ vốn đã đáng kể của mình với việc mua thêm 7.420 BTC với giá 458,2 triệu đô, nâng tổng số lên 252.220 BTC, trị giá 15,8 tỷ đô. Khi những tiến bộ về thể chế này được thực hiện, các nỗ lực thực thi pháp luật cũng đang tăng cường để loại bỏ các tác nhân xấu.

33958724,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644436,1727238629,BNY Mellon Moves Forward With Bitcoin Custody Services Following SEC Exemption,"Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) is making significant strides toward launching custody services for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), following its recent exemption from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. As previously reported by Bitcoinist on Friday, BNY Mellon is the first bank to receive this exemption, allowing it to avoid treating the custody of cryptocurrencies as a balance-sheet liability. BNY Mellon Seeks To Expand Crypto Custody Services The announcement came to light during the testimony of Chris Land, general counsel for pro-Bitcoin US Senator Cynthia Lummis, who confirmed that the SEC had granted BNY Mellon this crucial exemption. According to a Bloomberg report, BNY Mellon is now closer to rolling out custody services for Bitcoin and Ether held by clients of exchange-traded products (ETPs). Related Reading: SUI Price Sits 40% Below All-Time High As TVL Approaches $1 Billion The SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant conducted a review earlier this year and did not object to BNY Mellon’s determination that safeguarding crypto assets for regulated ETP clients should not be recognized as a liability on its balance sheet. However, BNY Mellon cautioned that this decision does not resolve the broader issues related to SAB 121, which continues to restrict banks’ ability to custody digital assets. The bank indicated its intention to engage further with the SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant for additional use cases, leveraging a “facts and circumstances” approach. The bank stated that it is actively engaging with its banking regulators to facilitate custody services for crypto ETP clients at scale. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Drive Crypto Custody Opportunities Per the report, the crypto custody market is rapidly expanding, with estimates suggesting it could be worth approximately $300 million and growing at around 30% annually. Providers can charge significantly higher fees for safeguarding digital assets compared to traditional securities, with costs potentially reaching up to ten times more. This heightened expense is largely due to the increased security measures needed to protect against cyber threats, which have resulted in substantial financial losses across the digital asset industry. Related Reading: XRP Remains Bullish: Crypto Experts Unveil Predictions For The Price BNY Mellon, which oversees over $50 trillion in assets, has expressed confidence in the strong demand for bank-qualified custodians for digital assets. Currently, the bank supports 80% of SEC-approved Bitcoin and Ether ETPs through its fund services business. By offering crypto custody, BNY Mellon aims to provide clients with a comprehensive end-to-end solution. The recent launch of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has highlighted the growing opportunities within the crypto custody sector. Major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments have already accumulated significant assets in these products, further underscoring the market’s potential. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has risen to $64,380, up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.

42417195,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTQb3F,1727237431,Harris Loses 'Support' Rating from Crypto Advocacy  as Grade Changes to 'NA' From 'B',"Stand With Crypto, a bipartisan advocacy group, has moved Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' rating to 'NA' from B.  The democrats do not have a comprehensive crypto policy, unlike the Republican campaign.  Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Kamala Harris is now ranked ""N/A"" by the political action committee Stand With Crypto, in a withdrawal of her previous rating of ""B.""  Harris' prior rating of B was based on a quote from a recent speech she gave to donors, in which she said she would ""invest in America's future"" and encourage ""innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors.""  However, aside from that, her campaign has not articulated a crypto policy.  Stand With Crypto labeled Harris's two-word mention of ""digital assets"" as ""somewhat pro-crypto,"" and her general B rating came with the general descriptor of ""somewhat supportive.""  So in that sense, the removal of the B rating could be seen as a downgrade of the organization's rating of the candidate, since its mission is to encourage politicians to explicitly espouse policies supportive of crypto.  In contrast, the Republican campaign has laid out detailed crypto policies, which says it will ""end Democrats' unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown and oppose the creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency."" Also, it promises to ""defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets.""  CoinDesk recently reported, citing campaign sources, that Harris' campaign isn't likely to include a deep dive into her crypto views.  Sources that spoke to CoinDesk said her campaign is keeping digital assets policy broad and high-level, with crypto as one of several economic innovations she plans to highlight.  The campaign is maintaining high-level discussions with crypto insiders, including executives from Ripple Labs and Coinbase.  Speaking earlier with CoinDesk, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Grewal expressed optimism about the Harris campaign's growing understanding of crypto industry needs, noting progress in both her and Republican candidate Donald Trump's positions.  ""All we want are sensible rules, and we'll follow them,"" he told CoinDesk.  Grewal told CoinDesk that he hoped crypto would remain a non-partisan issue, with Circle's Jeremy Allaire later echoing the sentiment during an interview with CNBC, calling it a ""purple"" issue.

Ethereum ETFs Continue To Underperform Despite the highly-anticipated and strong start for Ethereum ETFs in July 2024, the latest crypto-based ETFs have, thus far, failed to sustain institutional interest. The latest data from crypto ETF tracker SoSoValue shows that ETH ETFs witnessed a daily total net outflow of $79.2 million on September 23. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Debut: BlackRock Reigns With $260M Inflows, Grayscale Bleeds Upon closer inspection, it appears that the bulk of the outflows originated from Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which saw $80.6 million exiting the fund, bringing its cumulative net total outflow to $2.85 billion. In contrast, Bitwise’s ETHW posted net inflows of $1.3 million, propelling its cumulative net total inflows to $320.3 million. It’s worth noting that the latest exodus of funds from Ethereum ETFs is the fourth-largest in terms of value since their inception on July 23, 2024. The total net assets (TNA) of Ethereum ETFs stand at $7.2 billion, compared to $57.9 billion for Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. The continued underperformance of Ethereum ETFs relative to Bitcoin ETFs does not inspire much confidence in ETH’s future price potential. The ETH/BTC trading pair provides clarity, as the ratio is currently trading at levels it last witnessed way back in April 2021. ETH has erased all the gains against BTC it recorded over the past three years. The recent subpar performance of ETH against BTC isn’t surprising since the latter recorded a new all-time-high (ATH) value of $73,737 in March 2024, while the former has yet to breach its ATH of $4,878 recorded in November 2021. Challenges may lie ahead for ETH ETFs as speculation grows about the potential launch of ETFs for competing cryptocurrencies, such as Ripple’s XRP. Grayscale recently unveiled the first XRP trust in the U.S., paving the way for a future potential XRP ETF. Analysts Confident About Ethereum’s Comeback Ethereum’s challenges have not dampened the optimism several digital assets analysts shared toward the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Near the launch of Ethereum ETFs, research firm ASXN predicted that the funds could attract monthly inflows ranging from $800 million to $1.2 billion. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Comeback Following Interest Rate Cut: Steno Research Similarly, cryptocurrency exchange Bitwise’s Matt Hougan recently dubbed Ethereum the “Microsoft of blockchains,” indicating confidence in the leading smart contract blockchain protocol.

ETH started a downside correction from the $2,701 high like Bitcoin. There was a drop below the $2,640 level. The price spiked below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,528 swing low to the $2,700 high. However, the bulls were active near the $2,600 support zone. The price tested the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,528 swing low to the $2,700 high and is currently rising. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with support at $2,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,660 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,700 level. The next key resistance is near $2,720. An upside break above the $2,720 resistance might call for more gains. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,850 level or $2,880. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,680 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,620 level and the triangle’s trend line. The first major support sits near the $2,600 zone. A clear move below the $2,600 support might push the price toward $2,550. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,525 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,450.

There was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $63,750 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).

33954807,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644250,1727229658,"Bitcoin Prediction: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why $100,000 Is The Nominal Price Level For 2025","Optimism about the Bitcoin future outlook remains strong, with a crypto analyst forecasting a massive $100,000 price increase for the pioneer cryptocurrency. With expectations of an even greater price surge, the analyst believes that a $100,000 ATH for Bitcoin in 2025 is a nominal price target. Why Bitcoin Will Rise To $100,000 In 2025 Luke Broyles, a prominent crypto analyst and Bitcoin enthusiast recently dived into a discussion about the relationship between Bitcoin’s price and inflation, specifically how the United States (US) inflation affects the value of the cryptocurrency over time. The analyst argues that by 2025, Bitcoin’s nominal price could reach $100,000 due to inflation. However, the extent of this price rally would barely reach levels seen in 2021. Related Reading: Diamond Hand Ethereum Whale Moves 15,000 ETH, Here’s The Destination Before making his $100,000 bullish forecast, Broyles predicted that Bitcoin could rise to $65,000 soon. He compared his projected price leap to Bitcoin’s price all-time high in 2021, which was above $69,000. According to the analyst, the real value for the 2021 ATH, adjusted for inflation, is actually $83,000 in today’s market. This implies that even if Bitcoin’s current value surges to new levels around $65,000, the cryptocurrency would not have the same purchasing power it did in 2021. Broyles has projected that in the next six to eight months, there will likely be more money printing, potentially increasing inflation further. Subsequently, he predicts that this rise in inflation could be a catalyst to pushing Bitcoin’s price to $95,000. Commenting on the analyst’s predictions, a crypto community member questioned his analysis of Bitcoin’s future trajectory, highlighting that a $95,000 price increase was bearish. Another crypto member claimed that inflation in the US is much higher than what is reported, stating that “the real Bitcoiners” believe that inflation is at least 21% per year, as such Bitcoin should be worth $210,000. Responding to the member, Broyles expressed skepticism about the 21% inflation claim but admitted that inflation could be as high as 12%, 14%, and 16% annually. In a previous post, Broyles analyzed the current status of the Bitcoin bull market. According to the analyst, the market cycle is halfway through, with 50% of the expected timeline completed and 40% of potential returns achieved. Additionally, Bitcoin’s market sentiment has developed only 10% and Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) has barely begun, at just 5%. Analyst Predicts Next BTC Top On September 24, crypto analyst Ali Martinez forecasted Bitcoin’s next market top in this cycle. According to Martinez, if Bitcoin’s Long Term Power Law holds true, the market can expect the cryptocurrency’s next peak to reach $400,000. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 8,500% Rally For Cardano To Reach $31 As Indicators Turn Bullish The Bitcoin Power Law is a concept or theory that suggests a specific mathematical relationship between the price of Bitcoin and its market behavior or adoption.

33952436,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644235,1727224252,Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Is At A Critical Retest: Can Bulls Triumph?,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of the short-term holders is currently making a retest that could prove significant for BTC’s price. Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio Is Retesting Its 155-Day MA Right Now As explained by on-chain analyst Checkmate in a new post on X, the short-term holder MVRV Ratio breaking above its 155-day moving average (MA) could lead to bullish action for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Coming? These Two Signals Could Suggest So The MVRV Ratio is a popular indicator that, in short, keeps track of how the value held by the BTC investors as a whole (that is, the market cap) compares against the value that they initially put in (the realized cap). When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average address on the network can be assumed to be holding a net profit right now. On the other hand, it being under the threshold suggests the dominance of loss in the market. In the context of the current topic, the MVRV Ratio of only a specific segment of the sector is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). The STHs include the investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Thus, the MVRV Ratio for this cohort tells us about the profit/loss status of the buyers from the last five months. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio has surged recently as the latest recovery rally in the cryptocurrency’s price has taken place. With this increase, the indicator has edged just above the 1 mark, implying profitability has returned for the cohort. More importantly, though, the metric is now trying to find a break above its 155-day MA. As Checkmate has highlighted in the chart, BTC has generally tended to enjoy some bullish momentum whenever the STH MVRV Ratio has crossed above this line. The last time that this type of crossover had occurred in the indicator was back in the first quarter of this year and what had followed it was the coin’s rally to a new all-time high (ATH). Given the precedence, it’s possible that BTC may once again see a bullish wave, should the STH MVRV Ratio manage to break beyond its 155-day MA. “If the bulls get their way, and we set a weekly higher high ~$65.3k, I’d reasonably expect an attempt to the ATH,” notes the analyst. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Reach $108,000 To $155,000 By 2024 End, Analyst Reveals Why Checkmate also warns, however, that profit-taking from these investors could be to watch out for once the price reaches the $66,100 to $70,800 range. This is because, these investors, who don’t tend to have a strong resolve, would get into notable profits at those levels. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen a jump of around 8% over the past week, which has taken its price to the $63,700 level.
